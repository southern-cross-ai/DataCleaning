<p>'All is well,' Judith said quietly, coming forward and
stroking the red apples of the sofa. 'I shall not leave you,
Jennifer. It is better I remain.'</p>

<p>As her hand mechanically stroked those same rosy apples, so
friendly and familiar, she reflected.</p>

<p>Yes, this simple sentence declared the crisis of her whole
existence. Nothing ever again could matter to her so deeply as
this decision. With it she had cut away half her life, and
perhaps the better half. She was not by nature a dramatic woman;
moreover, she had but lately returned from the funeral of the
best friend she had, and she was forty-seven years of age in this
month of January 1822. So--for women then thought forty-seven a
vast age--she should be past drama. Quietly she sat down on the
sofa, leaned forward, looking into the fire. Jennifer Herries was
speaking with eager excitement, but Judith did not hear her.
Jennifer was fifty-two and should also be past drama but,
although a lazy woman, she liked sensation when it did not put
herself to discomfort.</p>

<p>Judith at that moment heard and saw nothing but the past, the
past that she was irrevocably forsaking. Strange how the same
patterns were for ever returning! Her father had been a rogue and
a vagabond, a rebel against all the order and material discipline
of the proper Herries. In his early years he had married
Convention and of her had had a son, late in life he had married
a gipsy and of her had had a daughter in his old age, when he was
over seventy. David at one end of his life, Judith at the
other.</p>

<p>In their histories again the pattern had been repeated. David
of his marriage had had two sons: Will the money-maker, Francis
the dreamer. Will prospered even now in the City; Francis was a
failure, dead of his own hand.</p>

<p>And with their children again the pattern was repeated. For
Will's son Walter was triumphant near by in his house at
Westaways, and Francis' widow, Jennifer, and Francis' children,
John and Dorothy, remained, undefended, here at Uldale.</p>

<p>It was here that she, Judith, came into the pattern. Daughter
of two vagabonds, mother of an illegitimate boy, she should be
vagrant. Half of her--the finer, truer, more happy and fortunate
half--(she nodded at the fire in confirmation) was so. But the
other half was proper, managing, material, straight-seeing
Herries. She threw her wild half into the blaze (her hand
flickered towards the fire). It was gone. She remained to fight
for Jennifer, Jennifer's children, John and Dorothy, and, maybe
who knows? . . . her own boy Adam.</p>

<p>To fight whom? Here Jennifer's voice broke through:</p>

<p>'. . . That will be most agreeable. I have always said that
the Yellow Room needs but a trifle altering and it will make . .
. but Francis would never see it. And with a new wallpaper . . .
We must certainly have a new wallpaper . . .'</p>

<p>To fight Walter Herries, and all that were his. As 'Rogue'
Herries in his tumble-down house in Borrowdale had fought all the
world, as Francis his grandson had tried to fight the world and
failed, so now would she fight Walter, flamboyant, triumphing
Walter, made of Will and his money-bags, sworn to extinguish
Jennifer and her children and all that were in Fell House,
Uldale.</p>

<p>It had been the wish of her whole life to flee from all the
Herries and live in the hills as her mother had lived before her,
but Walter Herries had challenged her and she had taken up the
challenge.</p>

<p>'. . . Not that it should be difficult,' Jennifer was saying,
'to find another girl to work with Doris. Girls will come
willingly enough now that you are going to remain, Judith, dear .
. .'</p>

<p>Walter and his two children, Uhland and Elizabeth, with all
the money in the world, against Jennifer and <i>her</i> children,
undefended and helpless, Judith and her Adam, fatherless and by
law without a name . . .</p>

<p>Jennifer was going on: 'And Walter will not <i>dare</i>, now
that you are remaining, Judith . . . You are the only one of us
all of whom he is afraid . . . He will not <i>dare . . .</i>'</p>

<p>Would he not, so large and confident and powerful? Had he not
said that he would snuff them out--Jennifer, John, Dorothy--raze
Fell House to the ground? And what had <i>she</i>, small,
elderly, alone, with no one in the world belonging to her save
Adam, to oppose to that strength?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she looked across to Jennifer triumphantly.</p>

<p>'We will give Walter something to think about,' she said.</p>

<p>'And you can go to Watendlath when you wish,' Jennifer
said.</p>

<p>'Oh no. Watendlath is over for me. Watendlath is ended, a
closed valley.'</p>

<p>'But how foolish, Judith. It is only a mile or two.'</p>

<p>'It is the other end of the world.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She did not tell anyone how that night, with Adam asleep
beside her, she cried. She lay awake for half the night, hearing
the owl hoot, a mouse scuttle, and seeing a slow, lonely moon
trace with her silver finger a question mark across the
floor.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were wild, incoherent, most mingled. At one
moment she was fiercely rebellious. She sat up, staring about
her. No, she would not remain! She would tell Jennifer in the
morning that she revoked her decision. She allowed her fancy then
to play with the lovely sequence of events if she went. Tom
Ritson should arrive in his cart. She and Adam would be packed
into it, and, after tearful farewells, they would be off, down
the hill with one last backward wave at the bottle-green windows
of the Uldale shop and the slow friendly shoulder of the moor,
along the road to Bassenthwaite, beside the Lake, Keswick, then
up the hill again, above Lodore, and then--Oh, happiness! Oh,
joy! The little valley closing them in, the long green field, the
tumbling Punchbowl, the two farms, her own, John Green House, and
the Ritsons'; below the farm the round scoop of the Tarn, black
or silver or blue, the amphitheatre of the hills, the sheep
nosing at the turf, the cattle moving in the byre, and best of
all, Charlie Watson, straight as an arrow in spite of his years,
riding towards her over the stones . . . the fresh sweet air,
tang of soil and bracken, glitter of stones, sweep of the
changing sky . . . she had to catch the sheets between her
hands.</p>

<p>That life was for ever surrendered. Then, at once, her other
practical self came running in. She was mistress of Fell House
now. They would all do anything that she told them. Jennifer was
her slave. She had seen, at the Ireby funeral, what the
neighbours and villagers thought of her. Yes, in spite of her
illegitimate son. Many things would have to be done. Had she
strength enough? It was the convention that a woman over forty
was an 'old thing' without savour. It was true that she had been
aware, for some time past, of the troubles, melancholies, miasmas
peculiar to her time of life, but she had refused to surrender to
them. She felt within her a wonderful vitality and energy, as
though she were at the beginning of life rather than more than
half through the course of it. Just as in earlier days her love
for her husband Georges had filled her with fire and splendour,
so now her love for her son Adam glorified her. She was such a
woman.</p>

<p>Yes, many things needed to be done. Walter Herries thought
that Fell House was at an end, did he? She would show him.
Jennifer had money. They could purchase the piece of land towards
Ireby . . . four more cows, two more horses. The dairy must be
enlarged. They were lucky in their servants. Bennett was devoted,
would do anything for her. Jack was a good boy. Mrs Quinney was
honest and hard-working, although she had a tongue when she was
put out. Martha Hodgson was a good God-fearing cook, who never
grumbled so long as she was not interfered with, and Doris would
do well if they had a child in from the village to help her.</p>

<p>They must entertain more than they had done. John and Dorothy
were growing now. John was fourteen and Dorothy thirteen. It was
right that they should take their proper place in the County . .
. She must find a tutor for John and Adam. Someone who would have
no dealings with Walter. There was Roger Rackstraw in Keswick, a
friend of Miss Pennyfeather's. He had a broken nose and looked
altogether like a prize-fighter, but he had been for two years
tutor to the Osmaston children and had done well there. She would
see about that in the morning. She would lose no time. And,
maybe, she might, after all, shortly pay a visit to Watendlath,
stay with the Ritsons for a week, ride over to Watson's farm . .
. No, no . . . Better leave that alone until she was settled
here, settled deep, deep down so that she could never pull
herself up again.</p>

<p>Then once more desolation caught her. She lay back on her
pillow sobbing. She could not help it. She had given up all that
she loved best in the world, all save Adam. And for what? She had
been considering Walter Herries as too serious a figure? What was
he after all but a big, blundering bully? What could he have done
to Jennifer and the children? John would soon be able to protect
his mother . . . But no. John was soft, sensitive, gentle. She
remembered how years ago Mrs Ponder, a servant in the house, had
thrown his pet rabbit out of the window. She had thought then
that he would have died of misery. And yet he had courage. Only a
few days before, when the rioters had set fire to the stables, he
had sat with his mother through all the noise and confusion,
reading to her, trying to comfort her . . . He had courage, but
he was no match for his Cousin Walter. She, and she alone . . .
At that she fell, at last, asleep.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was natural that the world of Judith's son, young Adam,
should be very different in shape, colour and contents from his
mother's.</p>

<p>He was now in his seventh year and as strong as a young colt.
He was, most certainly, not handsome. Even his mother could not
think so. His hair was black and straight without a suspicion of
a wave in it, his nose snub, his mouth large, his legs and arms
too long for his body as yet. Nevertheless, he gave promise of
both height and breadth. His grey eyes held both humour and
caution, and he was brown with health. He was clumsy in his
movements--indeed he was to move all his life short-sightedly,
and this not because he was short-sighted but because he was
absent-minded.</p>

<p>Were his interest thoroughly caught, absent-minded was the
last thing that he was, but he was often thinking of the
unexpected instead of the customary.</p>

<p>It seemed that his character would be warm and loyal, but he
was sparing of words. He hated to show feeling or express it. He
was independent, always venturing off on his own, busy on his own
purposes. Whether he liked or disliked anyone he never said, but
he had a very especial connexion with his mother and would, on a
sudden, leave what he was doing and search for her because he
thought that she needed him.</p>

<p>When he did this his intuition was always right. He was quite
fearless and could be very pugnacious, but he would attack
someone without warning and often when he had been smiling but a
moment earlier. He was inquisitive, would ask questions and
remember carefully the answers given him, although he would not
always believe their truth. On the whole, his independence, his
loyalty, his taciturnity and his courage were at present his
strongest characteristics. He walked very much by himself.</p>

<p>His horizon was larger than that of many boys of his age, for
his first years had been spent in France and after that he had
lived like a young peasant in the Watendlath valley. His friends
had been farmers like Charlie Watson and the Ritsons, farmers'
wives like Alice Perry, farmers' boys like the young Perrys.</p>

<p>Then on coming to Fell House he had known the first attachment
of his life (he was never to know very many). His mother was part
of himself and he of his mother, so that did not figure as an
attachment, but at the moment that he saw John Herries he adored
him.</p>

<p>John, Jennifer's boy, who was eight years older than Adam, was
fair, slender, handsome and an aristocrat. He walked with his
head up, as though he were made to rule the earth. But he was too
gentle and unselfish to wish to rule anyone, and it soon happened
that the young black ruffian Adam did all the commanding. John
was impetuous until checked, then was hurt and silent. He had a
very occasional stammer that added to his shyness. He had most
beautiful natural manners and was over-aware of the feelings of
others. He loved to be liked, hated to be disapproved of, while
Adam did not care whether anyone liked him or no. Nevertheless,
Adam responded deeply to affection, although he said nothing that
showed this. He forgot neither kindness nor injury, but John was
always eager to heal a quarrel; John was wretched in an
atmosphere of unfriendliness. Adam enjoyed a fight if he felt
that the cause was a worthy one.</p>

<p>John's sister, Dorothy, was fair, plump and amiable. She was a
type that was always recurring in the Herries families. She had
some of her mother's laziness, but took a livelier interest in
the outside world than her mother did.</p>

<p>Adam's world seemed sufficiently filled with these
figures--his mother, Jennifer whom he called his aunt although
she was not, John, Dorothy, Mrs Quinney the housekeeper, Mrs
Hodgson the cook, Bennett the coachman, Jack the stable-boy,
Doris, two dairy-maids. Until now there had also been Mr Winch
the tutor, but Mr Winch was gone for ever.</p>

<p>Geographically his world held first the house, the garden, the
stables, then the moors that fell to the very edge of the garden,
Skiddaw and Blencathra under whose shadows all the life of the
house passed, and beyond them Keswick, and beyond that the world
of Watendlath becoming speedily to him now a dream world, a sort
of fairy kingdom where all the glories and wonders of life were
enclosed.</p>

<p>However, he had then (and he was always to have) the great
gift of accepting what he was given and making the best of it. It
is true that did he feel he was being given something that he
ought not to be given, he would fight relentlessly to change it.
He had, for instance, felt that he was <i>not</i> given Mr Winch,
and he had fought Mr Winch most gallantly. It seemed only in the
proper nature of things that Mr Winch should be removed.</p>

<p>His attitude to John changed as time passed. He did not love
him less, but when he found that he could make John and Dorothy
do as he wished he had his way with them. Although he was only
six he knew very well on every occasion what it was that he
wanted to do. The only trouble was that others did not always
want to do likewise.</p>

<p>Like a stone flung into a pool so the fearful adventure of the
rioters had broken into the settled pattern of Adam's life. That
had been one of his proudest moments when his mother had told him
to go into Aunt Jennifer's room and wait there until 'the men who
were throwing stones at the windows' had gone away. He had known
that there was more in his mother's mind than she expressed in
words. She had in fact said to him: 'I shall have occupation
enough. I trust <i>you</i> to guard all that I have no time for.'
A strange scene that was in Aunt Jennifer's bedroom with all the
familiar things, the high bed with the crimson curtains, and Aunt
Jennifer's lovely black hair in a lace cap, her silver shoes and
a green turban with a feather in it lying on the floor, Dorothy
sitting virtuously on a chair pretending that she listened to
John who was reading from Goldsmith's <i>History of England</i>
(Adam did not, of course, know what the book was), John with his
gentle voice reading on and on, never taking his eyes from the
book--all this so quiet and ordinary, while the reflection from
the flames of the burning stables played like living figures on
the wallpaper, and the muffled echoes of shouts and cries came
from below. He would never forget the white tenseness of John's
face, the little exclamations of Aunt Jennifer: 'Oh dear! Oh
dear!' 'Listen to that!' 'We shall all be murdered!' 'Children,
we shall all be murdered!', the ridiculous aspect of the leather
cushions that had been pushed up against the windows, the way in
which everything in the room jumped and sank and jumped again in
accordance with the fiery hands that stroked the walls. He
himself sat on a low chair near the bed and had no doubt but that
he was there on guard over them all. He was prepared that at any
moment Aunt Jennifer should jump out of bed and run as she was
into the passage and down the stairs. It was privately his
opinion that she showed great cowardice to remain there while his
mother and Bennett and Mrs Quinney were defending the house, but
he had a patronizing, forgiving affection for Aunt Jennifer, as
though she were a pony gone at the knees, or a dog that wouldn't
fight other dogs, or a doll whose stomach oozed sawdust.</p>

<p>It was all that he himself could do to sit there thus quietly,
but his mother had given him that piece of work and so without
question there he was!</p>

<p>The worst moment of all was when Aunt Jennifer suddenly cried
(just as John was reading about the Princes who were murdered in
the Tower): 'Oh, it is me that they are after! I know it is! . .
. They have always hated me! They will burn the house over us! .
. . We mustn't remain here, children . . . We must fly or we
shall have the house burnt over our heads!'</p>

<p>Although Adam was too young to be aware of it, it was perhaps
the serious regard that the three children bestowed upon her that
forced her to lie back again upon her pillow, to close her eyes
and await, as best she might, the outcome.</p>

<p>Indeed the affair was soon at an end. Quiet fell in a moment.
The shadows and tremblings of the flames' reflections continued
to play upon the walls of the room. John opened the door and
listened. Below there were shufflings of feet, whispers, someone
was weeping. They waited . . . At last Judith herself came, and
Adam learnt that Uncle Reuben was dead.</p>

<p>The news was the first real crisis in young Adam's life, the
first occasion on which he had been close to a death that was
real and actual to him. In France the old Cur&eacute; of the
village had died when paying them a call, but Adam had been too
young to understand. In Watendlath a cow had died and one of
Charlie Watson's horses. But Uncle Reuben had been his friend. He
had spent whole days with him in the hills and, although he had
been fat and puffed as he climbed a hill, he had been able to
talk to hundreds of people at the same time and had known stories
about Abraham, the Lord Jesus, the Giant of Poland, King Arthur's
Round Table and scores of others. He had never bothered Adam with
making him do things he did not want to do, as Charlie Watson
sometimes did, and he carried gingerbread and lollipops in the
pocket of his gown.</p>

<p>Now Uncle Reuben was dead, shot with a gun that had been fired
by one of the wicked men who wanted to burn the house down. As
the consciousness of this absolute fact, positive, not in any
circumstances to be changed, sank into Adam's mind, something
affected him for ever. He was, his whole life afterwards, to
remember the moment when his mother, breaking off from some story
that she was telling him, drew him towards her and said to him
that now they were to remain at Fell House, not go to Watendlath
as she had promised, and they were to remain to fight . . . To
fight whom? . . . Was it Uncle Walter?</p>

<p>He suggested Uncle Walter because he himself wanted to fight
him. Once in the hills when he had been bathing, Uncle Walter had
ridden past on a white horse and tried to strike him with his
whip. He had not forgotten that. He would never forget. So it
seemed to him quite natural that he and his mother should fight
Uncle Walter. And now when his mother said that they would remain
here and not go to Watendlath he connected that with Uncle
Reuben's death and concluded at once that it was Uncle Walter who
had shot him. That being so, he, Adam, would one day shoot Uncle
Walter. The sequence of ideas was quite natural and inevitable.
He said nothing. He asked no questions. But he did one thing. He
had a black doll, a black doll with a red coat and brass buttons.
He hung the doll from a nail on the wall and threw marbles at it.
Within a week he could hit the doll from a great distance. The
doll's face that had been made of painted clay was no longer a
face.</p>

<p>Then on an afternoon late in February, John and Adam had a
curious adventure. Adventures were for ever happening to Adam,
whether watching a carriageful of ladies tumbled into the ditch
on the Carlisle Road, seeing a drunken old man fall off the top
of the Kendal coach, looking at the gipsies who came and pitched
with their caravans painted orange and blue on the moor above the
house until they were ordered away (they had brown babies, two
monkeys and a basketful of snakes; a woman in a crimson kerchief
with silver coins through her ears invited Adam to join them: had
it not been for his mother he would have done so). Adventures for
him were perpetual, but this one had for him a new quality,
terrifying had he allowed himself to be terrified.</p>

<p>It had been a strange day. In the forenoon there had been
showers of rain that had filled the road with puddles of silver.
Then Skiddaw about two of the afternoon took a step or two and
came face to face with the house, dragging a stream of clouds
over his shoulder with him. He had a way of doing this: a shrug
of shoulders, a quiver of his sides and there he was staring in
at the parlour window. The air was fresh with a sniff of spring
(although spring would not be with them for a month or two). Adam
walked out as far as the stream in the hollow below the Tarn; the
water glided and leapt. The moss was wet on the gleaming stones
above the brown water; the Fell rose straight from the hollow and
was thronged with little moorland streams, for there had been
heavy rains. He thought that he saw an eagle and he looked up and
up into the sky that was whitish blue and empty until the clouds
that clung on to Skiddaw's shoulders. All these little things
belonged to the adventure. As he entered the house again Skiddaw
receded and the clouds turned rose; the road beyond the garden
wall was very hard and white. He could hear a young owl hooting.
He climbed the stairs to find two large marbles, one crystal
white, one purple, that he liked to carry in his pocket. Then
slid down the banisters to the parlour. He knew that his mother
and Aunt Jennifer were paying a visit. They had gone in the
carriage with Bennett.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the parlour he found John and saw at once
that he was shaking with some event. He pulled Adam by the arm
into the room, which was lit only with the dusk of the falling
day and the sharp jumping flames from the fire.</p>

<p>He spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p>'Adam! . . . Cousin Walter has been here!'</p>

<p>Adam looked to the window.</p>

<p>'No,' said John, 'he has gone.'</p>

<p>'He came into the house?'</p>

<p>The two boys whispered like conspirators.</p>

<p>'No. Not so far as the house. He was on a white horse. He got
down and stood at the gate. Then he opened it and stood in the
garden. He stayed looking at the house without moving, for a long
while. Then he went out and rode away. I saw him through the
window.'</p>

<p>Adam drew a deep breath and clutched the two marbles in his
pocket.</p>

<p>'Did he look angry?' he asked at length.</p>

<p>'I could not see his face. Everything was so still. I thought
he would knock at the door, but when he was inside the gate he
never moved. He stood there looking. I thought he could see me
through the window and I hid behind the curtain.'</p>

<p>Adam went to the window and peered out. The glow in the sky
was bright and shredded now with little yellow clouds like
goslings.</p>

<p>'He is gone,' he said, his nose pressed against the cold
pane.</p>

<p>'Yes--but a moment back. He rode slowly up the hill. Oh, Adam,
why did he come?'</p>

<p>To spy on us.' Adam nodded his head. 'I shall go after
him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Adam, will you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, why not? Perhaps he has a gun and is waiting to shoot
someone.'</p>

<p>John must go too if Adam went, but he felt an overwhelming
fear, sprung from years of his mother's dread. Adam was too angry
just then to be frightened. When he was angry he was possessed
with rage; there was no room for any other emotion. When he had
been a baby his anger had sometimes almost choked him because it
boiled inside him and he could not shout nor cry. He took John by
the hand, and together, as quietly as might be, they stole out of
the house, closing the big heavy door gingerly behind them. The
owl hooted at them as they hurried on to the road.</p>

<p>Outside the gate Adam halted. Something in the whiteness of
the road pulled him up. But he knew what it was. A week ago he
had been walking up the hill and had come upon a fat and
distended frog. This frog was croaking in a despairing manner;
around its neck were folded the thin spiry legs of two smaller
frogs who clung thus, motionless, without sound. From the mouth
of the large distended frog protruded a tip of tongue scarlet
red.</p>

<p>Adam came the next day and found that the swollen frog was
dead (the red tongue still protruding), but the two live frogs
were still there, their legs interlaced, while another frog,
small and green, squatted near by on guard and to see that
justice had been done.</p>

<p>Adam was too young to feel spiritual disgust: his original
instinct had been one of interest and curiosity, but now the
scene around him was ghostly with evening mist, and out of the
mist sprang the sharp white road; by the side of the road was a
yellow-bellied frog with a tongue like blood and around him
croaked a chorus of green frogs. The moor was filled with green
frogs. He stood staring intently in front of him.</p>

<p>'What is it?' whispered John. 'He will be gone in an instant.'
They stood very close together and listened. All was still. The
lights of the little village we're coming out; Fell House was a
black mass against the mist.</p>

<p>It was perhaps the cold that drove them forward. They walked
on the turf at the side of the road so that they should make no
noise. They turned from the road and began to climb the moor,
stumbling over the unevenness of the turf. Suddenly, John caught
Adam's arm: 'Keep down . . . He's there!'</p>

<p>Just in front of them a shelf of turf rose above a cutting. To
the right of them, very close to them, three sheep, aware of
them, held together, their sides panting. But quite clearly the
boys could see the figure on the hill. He seemed gigantic in that
light, his white horse colossal. The mist, into whose vapours the
moon would soon pour her light, made a ghostly background to that
motionless horseman, great of bulk, in a black overcoat with a
high black collar. His thighs, his riding-boots, were jet against
the whiteness of his horse's flanks. Neither he nor his horse
moved. The sheep too seemed to be carved against the moor, and
the two boys, kneeling behind the rising of turf, their hearts
thumping as it seemed to them into their throats, waited to see
what he would do.</p>

<p>He did nothing. He stayed there looking down on to Fell House.
Then, as darkness fell, he turned his horse's head and rode
away.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c102">AT WESTAWAYS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Westaways was a very different place from Fell House,
Uldale.</p>

<p>Fell House would have always, whatever were done to it, the
atmosphere of the farm from which it had sprung. David Herries,
John's grandfather, had in his time made certain enlargements. He
was greatly proud--and so was Sarah his wife--of his dairies, the
garden with its fine lawn and Gothic temple, the parlour and the
best bedroom, but both David and Sarah had been simple people,
nor, since their marriage, had they travelled far afield. Sarah,
for a brief while, had been bitten with the London fashion,
fostered by Horace Walpole, <i>The Castle of Otranto,</i> Mrs
Radcliffe and the rest, for pseudo-medievalism, suits of armour,
stained-glass windows and plaster gargoyles, but she was not by
nature romantic and the craze had soon passed. Fell House,
nestling its warm cheek against the breast of the moor, was an
improved farmhouse and no more.</p>

<p>Utterly different from its very inception was Westaways. In
the early years of the eighteenth century old Pomfret Herries,
brother of 'Rogue' Herries, and so uncle to David, young John's
grandfather, had had it built, not because he wanted a beautiful
house but because he wished to go one better than his neighbours.
However, it <i>was</i> a beautiful house because he chose for
architect old John Westaway, saturnine and melancholy hermit, one
of the finest architects then alive, trained in Italy, the friend
of Vanbrugh and Chesterman, famous through all the north of
England not only for his skill but also for his eccentricities
and savage temper.</p>

<p>Old Pomfret had to pay for his ambitions and grumbled at the
cost for years after, but he had, in the end, a lovely house. It
is true that the only room in it of any value to himself was his
own apartment thronged with guns and fishing-rods. He was proud,
nevertheless, for people came from miles to see the house.</p>

<p>It was situated between Crosthwaite Church and the town of
Keswick. At that time the gardens ran down to the fringe of the
Lake. The virtues of the house were its beautiful tiles of rosy
red, the delicate wrought-ironwork across its front, the sash
windows--at that time a great rarity--the pillared hall, and
especially the saloon, whose decorations were designed and
executed by John Westaway himself. The subject of the design was
Paris awarding the apple, and the three goddesses were painted
with extreme vigour.</p>

<p>After old Pomfret's death the house passed out of the family
for a while, but Will, David Herries' money-making son, bought it
back again and thought to live in it. However, London, and
especially the City, held him too strongly. He found the country
both dull and fruitless. His son Walter reigned in Westaways in
his stead.</p>

<p>Walter, who had little taste but great energy and a readiness
to take the advice of others (for his own profit), enlarged and
improved Westaways. For a number of years workmen were always
about the place. He added a wing towards Crosthwaite, doubled the
stables, extended the gardens and had a grand conservatory. He
also put fine things inside the house; he had a famous piece of
tapestry that showed Diana hunting, some excellent sculpture, and
a Van Dyck and a small but most valuable Titian. There was also
over the door of the saloon a painting of the Watteau school in
deep rich colours of some French king dining with his ladies--a
picture all purples, oranges and crimson that the Keswick
citizens thought the finest thing they had ever seen. Only old
Miss Pennyfeather laughed at it and called it 'stuff', and Mr
Southey, after dining with Walter, was said never even to have
noticed it.</p>

<p>Walter Herries himself cared for none of these things for
themselves, but only in so far as they represented strength and
power.</p>

<p>At this time he was thirty years of age and his children,
Uhland and Elizabeth, who were twins, were seven; they were born
in the same year as young Adam and were a few months older than
he.</p>

<p>Walter was large in girth and limb, but could not at this
period be called stout. He was in appearance a survival of the
days of the Regency, now swiftly slipping into limbo. He seemed
already something of an anachronism with his coats of purple and
red, his high thick stock with its jewelled pin, his capacity for
eating and drinking, his roaring laugh, his passion for sport.
But he was not really such an anachronism as he seemed. In
politics, when he bothered to speak of them, he appeared as
reactionary Tory as Wellington or old Lord Eldon, but in reality
he stood closer to Huskisson and Canning. The fact was that he
learnt much from his father, who, one of the astutest men in the
City, had his eye more firmly fixed on the past. Walter, caring
for nothing but his personal power and the aggrandizement of his
family, loving only in all the world his crippled little son,
building his edifice in part for himself but in the main for
Uhland's future, considered that future very much more deeply
than anyone supposed. He suffered from the fact that no one in
his immediate surroundings was of any use to him in these things.
He reigned in a passionate loneliness and perhaps in that had
more in common with his great-grandfather, old 'Rogue' Herries,
than he would ever have dreamed possible. His wife Agnes he held
to be an imbecile, and she was truly as terrified of him as all
timid wives are supposed to be of tyrannous, loud-voiced
husbands.</p>

<p>On a certain fine September morning of this year, 1822, a
long-legged, supercilious individual named Posset (William
Posset, son of William Posset, coachman at Levons Hall) brought
into Walter Herries' dressing-room a large tin bath. The floor of
this dressing-room drooped in its centre into a hollow and in the
floor of this hollow was a small iron grating. Over the hollow
the bath was inserted. A pinch-faced youth in a uniform of dark
red and brass buttons then arrived with two vast pitchers so
large as almost to conceal him. With an air of extreme relief and
under the cold eye of the lengthy Posset, young Albert emptied
the pitchers into the bath. Posset then with delicate tread
stepped into the next room, pulled back the curtains and
approached the four-poster. Walter, his mouth wide open, his
chest bare, his nightshirt pulled down over one shoulder, was
snoring loudly. Posset, with a gravity worthy of a tax-collector,
shook the bare arm. Walter woke, gave one glance at Posset,
sprang from his bed, tugged his nightshirt over his head, rushed
in to the next room and plunged into the bath. Young Albert,
accustomed to the fierce eruption of water, always at this point
retired to the farthest corner of the room, where he stood,
towels over his arm, admiring, with an amazement that custom
never seemed to lessen, that great body, that splutter of
exclamations, grunts and oaths, and that sudden magnificent
figure of a man withdrawn from the water, suffering the lusty
(but always reverent) towelling of Posset--and water dripping
everywhere, running in little streams and eddies into the hollow
and away safely through the iron grating. Albert always informed
those less privileged that there was no sight in the world quite
so fine as his master as he plunged into his bath--no lion in a
show, no tiger in Indian jungle, could have the energy and vigour
of his master at this moment. It was Albert's top moment of his
day--a pity that it came so early; every event was a decline from
it.</p>

<p>Walter had long ago insisted that any visitor in the
house--his mother, his wife, very definitely included--must,
unless a doctor forbade them, be present at the family breakfast
table. It was the beginning of his patriarchal day. Only thirty
years of age, he already felt himself founder of the whole of the
Herries stock, and nothing pleased him better than to have
Herries collected from all over the country and seated at his
table.</p>

<p>This was not at present easy, for Keswick was tucked away in
the North and travelling was difficult. Nevertheless, this was
not a bad halting-place on the way to Scotland, and the number of
Herries 'bagged' for Walter's dining-table in the last five years
was remarkable.</p>

<p>Walter liked further to collect Herries who were oddities and
to encourage them in their idiosyncrasies--granted, of course,
that these idiosyncrasies did not inconvenience himself. Here he
was instigated by the old motive of the King and his Court
Jester. Walter might be said to have a great sense of fun, if no
very strong sense of humour. He liked, for example, to indulge
old Monty Cards in his femininities (Monty painted his cheeks and
powdered his nose), in his little meannesses and his nervous
terrors. He enjoyed the company of old Maria Rockage (for whom he
had a real liking) that he might shock her Methodist principles.
He even was childish enough to play on his wife's terrors by
laying a book on a door that it should fall on her when entering
a room. He was not at all above practical jokes and horseplay.
They were part of his 'Regency' manner.</p>

<p>He had just now as his guests, Phyllis, Maria Rockage's
daughter, her husband, Stephen Newmark, and three of her
children--Horace aged three, Mary aged two, and Phyllis only one.
She was anticipating a fourth. They were all very healthy
children and Mr Newmark looked upon them as just rewards tendered
to him by a grateful Deity.</p>

<p>For Stephen Newmark, tall, long-nosed, sanctimonious, was a
perpetual joy to Walter. He took life seriously. He enjoyed
Family Prayers. Walter, therefore, indulged his fancy and
insisted that all of them, Agnes his wife, his mother (who was
staying just then with him), his own two children, and all the
household should be present on the stroke of eight and offer up,
under the leadership of Mr Newmark, thanks to the Creator for the
dangers of a night safely past and the glories of another day
vouchsafed. It puzzled Mr Newmark a little that Walter should be
so truly determined on Family Prayers. This determination did not
altogether 'go' with his cock-fighting, horse racing,
card-playing, but Newmark had long ago decided (and confided to
Phyllis) that his Cousin Walter was 'a strange fish'. In that
conclusion he was perfectly correct.</p>

<p>On this morning, however, Walter had a small matter of
business to discharge before breakfast. Rosy, scented, his stock
starched until it glittered, his pantaloons of dark purple hiding
his magnificent legs, 'rings on his fingers and bells on his
toes', he descended, like Jove from Olympus, to the study where
he transacted his affairs.</p>

<p>Here his agent, Peach, was waiting for him. Peach was a short,
stocky, beetle-browed little man who had been in the service, for
most of his days, of the Duke of Wrexe. He came, therefore, from
the South and hated the North <i>and</i> the Northerners with a
dreadful passion. He would not have stayed here a day had it not
been for the odd power that Walter Herries exercised over him. He
could not be said to <i>love</i> his master--he was not known to
love any human being; he was not deferential, showed no
servitude, disputed his master's wishes hotly and was grudging in
thanks for benefits, but he seemed to have found in Walter
Herries a man who had stung, reluctantly, his admiration--the
only man in the world it might be. He appreciated Herries'
dominating roughness, coarseness, liking for horseplay, and then
something more--outside and beyond these.</p>

<p>In any case he made a wonderful servant and was hated
cordially throughout the countryside.</p>

<p>He was standing now, his legs, that were slightly bowed,
apart, his hand gripping the shoulder of a slim fair-haired boy
who, his hands tied behind him, his eyes wide open with fear and
apprehension, stayed there, his heart beating like a terrified
rabbit's.</p>

<p>'This is the boy,' Peach said.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Walter, looking at him.</p>

<p>The boy's eyes drooped. In his heart was the terror of death.
He knew that he could be hanged for what he had done.</p>

<p>'I discovered him,' Peach went on, 'last evening. He had a
small wheelbarrow and was placing in it some logs from the pile
outside the further stables.'</p>

<p>'What did he say?' Walter asked.</p>

<p>'He said nothing. At least not then. Later when he was shut
into the cellar for the night he admitted that he was hungry and
had a mother who was hungry and a small brother who was hungry.'
Peach gave a click in his throat, a favourite noise of his, and
it resembled a key turning in a door. 'They all say they're
hungry now.'</p>

<p>'What's your name?' asked Walter.</p>

<p>'Henry Burgess.'</p>

<p>'Well, Henry Burgess . . . You know what the Keswick Justices
will say?'</p>

<p>The boy was understood to mutter that he didn't care.</p>

<p>'You don't care? Well, all the better. It's a hanging matter,
you know.'</p>

<p>'I gave him food and drink,' Peach remarked reluctantly. 'He
wouldn't have held up else.' Then he added: 'His mother's been
waiting outside all night.'</p>

<p>There was an interruption. The door opened and Uhland came in.
It was his habit to find his father here before breakfast. For a
boy of seven he was tall and very spare and his face was grave
and sadly lined for a child. One leg was longer than the other
and he walked aided by a little ebony cane. When he saw that
there was company he stopped at the door. It was characteristic
of him that he stood there looking at them solemnly and said
nothing.</p>

<p>'Well, what's your defence?' asked Walter.</p>

<p>The boy was understood to say they were all hungry.</p>

<p>'All hungry, were you? That's not much of an excuse. Couldn't
you work?'</p>

<p>No work to be found. Hard times. Had been working for a
hostler. Turned away for fighting another boy who insulted his
mother.</p>

<p>'Young ruffian,' said Walter complacently. He stood, his chest
thrust out, his thumbs in his armholes. Then he nodded to Uhland,
who came limping forward. Walter put his arm round his son and
held him close to him.</p>

<p>'Uhland, this boy has been stealing my wood. He says he did it
because he was hungry. If he goes before the Justices it will be
a hanging matter. Shall I send him or no?'</p>

<p>Uhland stared at the boy, who suddenly raised his eyes,
glaring at them all.</p>

<p>'He doesn't <i>look</i> hungry,' he said quietly.</p>

<p>'No, upon my word he doesn't,' said Walter with boisterous
good humour. 'That's good for a child, Peach, is it not? He does
not look hungry. You are right, Uhland, my boy.' He laughed,
throwing back his handsome curly head. 'Well, what shall we do
with him?'</p>

<p>'Let him go, Papa,' said Uhland. His voice was cold, but he
looked at the boy with interest. 'We have plenty of wood.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but we shall not have,' said Walter, 'if all the young
vagabonds--Very well, let him go, Peach. He shall have the dogs
on him if he comes this way again.'</p>

<p>Without a word Peach, pushing the boy in front of him, took
him from the room.</p>

<p>Walter laughed, yawned, stretched his great arms.</p>

<p>'Well, my boy, how are you?'</p>

<p>'Very well, Papa, thank you.'</p>

<p>'Slept? No headache?'</p>

<p>'No, Papa, thank you.'</p>

<p>'Will you come with me into Keswick this morning?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>There was a pause; then Uhland said:</p>

<p>'Elizabeth wishes to come.'</p>

<p>'She can go with Miss Kipe.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>A roar like a wild beast's cry for his food filled the room.
It was the ceremonial gong--a gong brought from India, purchased
by Will and given by him to his son, a superb gong of beaten
brass and carved with the figures of Indian deities.</p>

<p>So they went to breakfast, Uhland's small bony hand in his
father's large one.</p>

<p>They were all assembled in the bright, high room whose wide
windows looked out on to the garden with the splashing fountain,
the Lake and the hills beyond. Stephen Newmark was there,
standing behind a reading-desk; Phyllis his wife; two of her
children; Elizabeth with her governess, Miss Kipe; Christabel
Herries, Walter's mother; Agnes, Walter's wife; Montague Cards
and the whole household--Posset, young Albert, the cook, the
maids and the little kitchen-help.</p>

<p>Walter took his place beside his wife and instantly they all
knelt. A long row of upturned boots met the interested gaze of
two robins on the window sill. After a while, with creaking of
knees, rustling of aprons, they all rose and sat down while Mr
Newmark read a selection from the New Testament. The sun flooded
the room. A large fat tortoiseshell cat came stealthily down the
garden path, its green eyes fixed on the robins. On the bright
road beyond the house the Burgess family began to trudge in
silence towards Carlisle, Walter put out his hand and laid it on
Uhland's shoulder. The cook, who was fat and had trouble with her
heart, began to breathe heavily, Posset caught the eye of the
prettiest of the maids and instantly looked away again. Little
Elizabeth, looking out, saw the cat and the birds. Her eyes
widened with apprehension.</p>

<p>'Let us Pray,' said Mr Newmark, and down on their knees they
all went again.</p>

<p>'May the blessing of the Lord rest upon us all this day,' said
Mr Newmark. There was a pause, then a rustle, a knee-cracking, a
boot-scraping, and they were all on their feet again.</p>

<p>The domestics were in line--Mrs Rains the cook, Posset, the
maids, Albert, the little kitchen-maid who had a round rosy face
and a neat waist--all in their proper order.</p>

<p>'Fresh country girls you succeed in getting, Walter,' said
Newmark after they were gone, his mind meditatively on the
kitchen-maid.</p>

<p>'Anybody wanting the barouche this fine morning?' said Walter
genially. He was in an excellent temper, which fact the three
ladies perceived and brightened accordingly. Christabel Herries,
Walter's mother, was fifty years of age and thin to emaciation.
She wore gowns of black silk with a purple Indian shawl thrown
about her narrow shoulders. She moved with timidity, as though
she were ever expecting a rude word. She adored her son but
feared him. She had been, all through her married life, under the
domination of Herries men. Her husband had never treated her with
unkindness, but the City had swallowed him, leaving Christabel
alone on shores of domesticity so barren that she occupied half
her London evenings talking to herself in a large drawing-room
all yellow silk and mirrors. Will, her husband, had hoped to make
her a social success. But after a disastrous Ball that they gave
in the summer of '96, a Ball that had ended with a scene between
Christabel and Jennifer, then a radiant young beauty, Will, with
a shrug of his shoulders, had reconciled himself to her
disabilities. He very quickly saw that the thing for him to do
was to make the money so that his son Walter might carry on the
family glory.</p>

<p>Walter had always been kind to his mother, but for family
rather than personal reasons. He thought her 'a poor fish', but
then he had no opinion of women unless they were handsome.
Christabel was, however, the mother of Walter Herries; she must
therefore be honoured by the outside world. And he saw that it
was so.</p>

<p>Agnes, as the wife of Walter Herries and the mother of his
children, should also have secured honourable treatment had the
thing been at all possible. But in this Walter saw that the world
was not to blame, for a more miserable woebegone sickly female
was not, he was assured, to be found in the civilized globe. When
he married her she had been something of the type of that new
rosy-cheeked kitchen-maid (whom he had noticed, and saw also that
Newmark had noticed). She had been merry at first with a certain
rather kittenish charm. But she was 'cold'. Marital relations had
terrified her from the first. Their marriage night had been a
horror, and after the birth of the twins they had occupied
separate bedrooms. Then she had had one sickness after another,
now did not choose to trouble to talk; 'sulky', Walter told
himself. She pretended to be fond of the children but, he was
happy to say, Uhland had already as much scorn of her as his
father had.</p>

<p>He felt (and with justice surely) that Fate had dealt unfairly
in giving so magnificent a man so wretched a partner. He was fair
to her, he gave her everything that she needed; all that he asked
of her was that she should keep out of his way and not interfere
with his plans for Uhland. With Elizabeth she should do as she
pleased.</p>

<p>Phyllis Newmark was tall, of a charming pink and white
complexion, and had a laughing eye.</p>

<p>Her father, Lord Rockage, in his place, Grosset in Wiltshire,
had given her love and kisses combined with general disorder,
poverty and Methodism. On these mixed virtues she had thriven.
She was kindly, cheerful, intelligent and quite uneducated. She
was born to be a mother, and a mother she was most assuredly
proving. She did not mind how many children she had. She adored
them all. Newmark, having helped to provide her with three, must
receive her grateful thanks. She gave him her obedience, laughed
at his foibles and understood him better than anyone else in the
world. She too had noticed his glance at the kitchen-maid
although at the same time she was murmuring (with real devotion)
the Lord's Prayer and observing a pimple on the neck of little
Horace and wondering whether Walter would allow them the barouche
that morning or force them into the post-chaise or order them to
walk. She knew, however, exactly how to deal with the
kitchen-maid, the pimple and the walk (if that were compulsory).
Nothing could defeat her; she inherited from both her parents
courage, honesty and an insatiable zest for life.</p>

<p>Soon they were all around the breakfast-table and set to with
an eagerness that spoke well for their digestions. Rounds of
beef; pies; fish, broiled and fried; eggs, baked, fried, boiled;
hams, tongues, jams, marmalades, buns, scones--everything was
there, and tankards of ale, tea, coffee . . . Agnes Herries alone
pretended to eat but did not.</p>

<p>'Yes, you may have the barouche,' Walter observed, 'and
Phyllis shall have the barouche box if she chooses--I know that
it gives her the greatest gratification both to see and be seen.'
Then, having paused sufficiently to catch all their attention, he
added:</p>

<p>'But first I have a visitor.'</p>

<p>'A visitor?'</p>

<p>'Yes. At ten o'clock precisely a lady is to come and see
me.'</p>

<p>'A lady?'</p>

<p>'A friend of you all--Mrs Judith Paris.'</p>

<p>He allowed his words to sink in. And indeed they caused a
stir. Both Christabel and Phyllis Newmark had the deepest
affection for Judith. To Phyllis she had been a familiar friend
since her babyhood, for Judith had once lived at Grosset, and to
Christabel she was perhaps the only woman in the world who had
never failed her, the one human being who did not patronize her,
cared for her as she was, knew with tenderness and perception the
barrenness of her life.</p>

<p>Yet Christabel had only seen her once in seven years. Only
once since the night when Judith had dined at Westaways, the
night of the news of Napoleon's escape from Elba. After that
Judith had fled to Paris, borne her illegitimate son there. Since
her return to Uldale there had been war between the two houses.
Whenever Christabel came up from London to stay with her son she
hoped that there would be some chance meeting, in a lane, in a
street. She had not dared herself to prepare a meeting.</p>

<p>'Oh, Judith!' Phyllis cried joyfully. 'I had been intending to
ask . . .'</p>

<p>'She is coming,' Walter said, greatly amused at the
disappointment that his womenkind would suffer, 'solely on a
business matter. The visit is only to myself.'</p>

<p>Then Christabel showed courage.</p>

<p>'Walter, you should invite Judith to dinner. Bygones are
bygones. You should most certainly invite her to dinner.'</p>

<p>'And Jennifer?' asked Walter, laughing.</p>

<p>Christabel's pale cheek flushed. No, she could never forgive
Jennifer. That old quarrel, twenty-six years old, could never be
forgotten. It had too many consequences. It had split the family;
it had been the close of Christabel's social life. She had never
had the courage to give a real party again. And then Jennifer had
behaved scandalously. She had been another man's mistress under
her husband's nose. That poor Francis had shot himself in London
was all Jennifer's fault. No, Jennifer was another matter.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said Walter, observing his mother's silence.
'You see, ma'am. And you cannot have Judith here without
Jennifer. Judith rules that house. She has become, I hear, a
perfect Turk . . . Well, well, it may not be for long.'</p>

<p>He added these last words in a half-murmur to himself. With a
final pull at his tankard of beer, wiping his mouth, with a bow
to the ladies, he got up, walked for a moment to the window and
stood there, looking out, then left the room.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone the children broke out into little
pipings and chirrupings. The two Newmark children (who should
have been in the nursery, but their father wished them to take
their part, even thus early, in the morning ceremony) rolled
decorously on the floor at their mother's feet. You felt that
already their infant eyes were cautiously on their father. Uhland
sat without moving, one leg over the other, an attitude
protective of his deformity. Elizabeth, shyly crossed the room.
She was a beautiful child, most delicate in colour and build. She
had none of the high bones of the Herries tribe. She did not seem
like a Herries until suddenly with a lift of her head you saw
pride and resolve, two of the finer Herries characteristics. Her
mother took her hand and they stayed quietly together, remote, in
a world of their own, without speaking . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Judith was shown into the little parlour next the saloon. It
had not been long since she had had a talk with Walter
there--last Christmas-time it had been. Now, as she sat on the
red morocco chair waiting for him, she thought of that, and how
there had been a bowl of Christmas roses. A petal had fallen
lazily, wistfully to the carpet. Their talk then had been almost
friendly. She had gone with him afterwards to the nursery to see
the children, and she had been touched by his protective love for
his son.</p>

<p>But now all was changed. In the interval between that meeting
and this she had had proof enough of the serious danger that this
big laughing man offered to her and to hers.</p>

<p>She was here to defend her own, and a wave of hot fierce pride
beat into her cheeks as she sat there, a small unobtrusive woman
in a black bonnet, her hands in a black muff, waiting for him to
come in. It was he who had written to her, a short polite note
asking her whether she could give him a few moments on an
important matter. She would not have come, but she also had
something of her own to say. She would see that she said it.</p>

<p>When he came in she got up and bowed, but did not offer her
hand.</p>

<p>'Well, Cousin Walter,' she said grimly. 'What do you wish to
see me about?'</p>

<p>His own tone changed when he saw her attitude. He had intended
to be friendly, jolly, a mood that he preferred, for he liked
himself in that role. But he was like a child if anyone affronted
him. It might be, too, that Judith was the only person in the
world of whom he had some fear. Still, his ground was sure and he
began confidently enough.</p>

<p>'Forgive my asking you to take this trouble, Cousin Judith.
You will agree, however, that I should be deceiving myself if I
fancied that my presence would be welcome at Uldale.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless,' she answered, 'you have paid us already at
least one visit this year.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?'</p>

<p>'Last February I believe it was. You did us the honour to ride
over and even to inspect our garden.'</p>

<p>He was confused. He had not thought that she knew of it.</p>

<p>'Well--it happened that I rode that way . . . But come, Cousin
Judith. I am certain that we have neither of us time to waste . .
.' Then he, added, a little awkwardly: 'I am sorry that you are
already determined that our talk shall be unfriendly.' (What was
there, he asked himself, about the little plain woman in the
homely bonnet that made him feel like a scolded schoolboy? She
had, in the last six months, acquired the devil of a manner--as
though she were already Queen of Cumberland. Well, he would show
her that she was not.)</p>

<p>She regarded him sternly.</p>

<p>'Cousin Walter, I was in this same room Christmas last. We had
a conversation that was not altogether unfriendly. Since then
facts have come to my knowledge. I know that it was through you
that Francis Herries left home and put an end to his life in
London. I know that it was because you bribed and suborned that
the riot occurred at Fell House--the riot that ended in the
undeserved death of the best friend I had in the world--Reuben
Sunwood. And since then,'--she spoke without emotion and without
removing her eyes from his face--'since I have been in charge of
things at Fell House, your hand has been everywhere. Those fields
towards Ireby that we intended to purchase--you paid an absurd
price for them, although you could not need the ground. You
bribed the cattle-man whom we had last March from Mungrisdale to
poison our cows. Within the last month you have attempted to
bribe Mr Rackstraw, who has been with us all this year as tutor,
to spy upon us as Mr Winch did before him. Mr Rackstraw has been
gentleman enough to show us loyalty. After these things--and I
have no doubt that there are many more with which your conscience
can charge you--it is perhaps a little without meaning to speak
of friendliness between us.'</p>

<p>Walter did not move, did not shift his great bulk, did not
turn his eyes away. He admired her. By God, he admired her! There
was someone here worth fighting.</p>

<p>'Very well, then,' he said at last. 'We know at least where we
stand, you and I. I will not, however, admit responsibility
either for Francis' weakness or Sunwood's rashness. Francis would
not have shot himself had he been another sort of man. It was his
whole life condemned him, not I. As to the riot, no one regretted
more than myself its most serious consequences. And what evidence
have you that I was concerned in that matter?'</p>

<p>'The evidence of Mr Winch,' Judith answered.</p>

<p>'Faugh! A wretched little time-server who cheated me quite as
steadily as he cheated yourself, Judith. As to other more recent
matters, well--do you recollect our last conversation in this
room?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly.'</p>

<p>'Then you will remember the challenge I laid down. I told
you--what I trust you sincerely believe--that I had no animosity
whatever towards yourself. I told you also that for reasons both
private and public I was resolved that Jennifer and her children
should vacate Fell House, and that if I could not see to it by
fair means that they went, then I would see to it by unfair. I
was honest in that. I gave you warning.'</p>

<p>'And on what ground,' Judith cried indignantly, 'had you the
right? Fell House is Jennifer's place. It is where her husband
was born and his children after him.'</p>

<p>'My father also was born there,' said Walter quietly. 'As you
may have observed, Judith, I have a great sense of family. It is
perhaps the greatest quality in me. Jennifer with her rotten
public history offends my sense of family. There is also an old
quarrel between her and my mother that possibly you have not
forgotten. In any case, I made you a fair offer then. I make you
a fair offer now. Let Jennifer and her children leave Fell House
and go to live in the South--and the matter is for ever
ended.'</p>

<p>'We are only beating the old ground,' answered Judith
impatiently. 'There is nothing to be said on that score. We defy
you now, Cousin Walter, as we defied you then. There is only now
this difference--that they have me to fight for them, and life
has made me a determined woman, not easily moved.'</p>

<p>'No,' he answered quickly. 'I am aware that you are not. We
are alike at least in that. But you know that my quarrel is
neither with you nor your boy. Indeed, it has never been. That is
one matter on which I wish to speak to you.'</p>

<p>He hesitated, then went on:</p>

<p>'It seems that my boy, Uhland, has met your boy Adam on
several occasions.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know it.'</p>

<p>'They are only babies, but Uhland is old for his age. He has
taken an unaccountable liking for your Adam.' He paused, laughed,
continued: 'Forgive me for that word "unaccountable". But for
children as young as they are--' He broke off.</p>

<p>She felt herself, against her will, touched. When Walter
mentioned his son a different character seemed to speak from his
eyes, his mouth, his very hands. He was young and proud when he
spoke of his son. Some better light shone through his coarse
texture. But she did not want to be touched.</p>

<p>'You must know,' she said impatiently, 'that it was through no
wish of mine that they met. It was in the woods beyond
Portinscale--pure accident.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I know, I know . . . I was not charging you with any
intention. But my boy speaks of him, wishes to see him--'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Judith answered, 'that is a mischance that we must
correct.'</p>

<p>'A mischance?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It would be good for neither of them, things being as
they are, that they should be better acquainted.'</p>

<p>Walter choked back some reply that he was about to make. His
control was remarkable.</p>

<p>'I had hoped,' he said steadily, 'that you would allow the
children occasionally to meet. We elders may have our divisions.
There is no reason--'</p>

<p>She broke in, jumping impetuously to her feet:</p>

<p>'No reason! No reason! There is <i>this</i> reason, Cousin
Walter--that you are our enemy. You have killed Francis Herries,
you would rob his children of the very roof over their heads.
Only a moment ago you threatened me. And yet you wish that my son
and your son--'</p>

<p>She stopped, sat down quietly, smoothing her skirt.</p>

<p>'I have still some of my old temper remaining although I am
near fifty . . . In fact, I may tell you, Cousin Walter, that I
was never in better health in my life. Aye,' she nodded her
bonnet, 'that is what I had come to say. You may think me an old
woman, but I am young enough yet to keep my son from your
influence and, pray God, I ever will be.'</p>

<p>He was angry; she had touched him. His hand fingered the
jewelled pin in his stock. But his voice was level as he
answered: 'Very well, then. You are confident, Cousin Judith. I
am an impatient man by blood, but in this case I can school
myself to waiting.</p>

<p>'Now hear my offer. It was to make it that I asked you to
visit me. Last week I purchased the land at High Ireby. It was my
intention, unless we come to some agreement together, to build a
house there.'</p>

<p>High Ireby? At once she grasped the implication. The High
Ireby land was on the hills above Uldale. It was at some
distance, but nevertheless it overlooked Fell House. Walter there
in some big place of his planning, with his fields, his cattle,
his servants . . . In spite of herself she showed some
agitation.</p>

<p>'That would be done,' she said at length slowly, 'to spite
us.'</p>

<p>'It would be done,' he answered, smiling (for he saw that she
grasped the consequences), 'because I admire the view. It would
not be perhaps altogether happy for Jennifer and her children to
have me so neighbourly.' He looked at her closely. She gave him
back look for look. 'But,' he went on, 'you have not heard my
proposition. This house here is now too small for me, but there
are other sites that I could choose, other than High Ireby. Then
it is one of two things. Either Jennifer sells me Fell House--I
will give her a good price for it--and removes herself South. And
in that case I would make you the offer of it. You should be my
tenant at a most moderate rental. Or I build on High Ireby. There
is no necessity for an immediate decision. I only wished that you
should know what I had in mind.'</p>

<p>Judith saw then his plan; that this should hang over them
night and day. If Walter built a house at High Ireby, it would
kill Jennifer. And John? His nature being as it was, he could not
endure it. Nor would it stop at Walter's living there. He would
be able, in a thousand ways, to molest them at Fell House, to spy
upon them, to break their privacy . . . Yes, it was a clever
notion.</p>

<p>'At any time, Cousin Judith,' he said, moving towards the
door, 'that Jennifer is ready for me to have Fell House at a good
price--'</p>

<p>She got up, putting her hands in her muff.</p>

<p>'You are clever, Walter,' she said. 'I grant you that. You are
clever.'</p>

<p>'I am flattered,' he said, bowing. 'I must be clever to fight
so brilliant an adversary.'</p>

<p>'Stuff!' she answered, tossing her head. 'None of your fine
manners. Time's wasted by them.'</p>

<p>Outside the door she turned.</p>

<p>'You are a strange man. So much trouble to persecute two weak
women.'</p>

<p>'One weak woman,' he corrected her.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs he said: 'You understand my
offer?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I understand.'</p>

<p>'Well, good day.'</p>

<p>'Good day to you, Walter.'</p>

<p>As she climbed into the chaise she was surprised to find
herself trembling. Her desire at that moment was to hasten home
and find them safe. Then to gather them all into her
arms--Jennifer, John, Dorothy and Adam.</p>

<p>But all she said aloud for the benefit of Bennett's broad back
was, once again, 'Stuff!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c103">ADAM'S WORLD</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It might be claimed that in spite of all that happened to him
afterwards, the most important years of Adam Herries' life were
from 1822 to 1826, from the age of seven to the comparative
maturity of eleven.</p>

<p>It was true that the French years and the Watendlath years
were important, but it was Mr Rackstraw who really woke him into
active conscious life, and Mr Rackstraw didn't come to Uldale
until after the riot at the beginning of 1822.</p>

<p>The five years that followed had for Adam three outstandingly
influential personalities--his mother, Mr Rackstraw and John.
Looking back, in later years, he sometimes fancied that
everything that he did afterwards, all the things that brought
him into trouble, all the things that gave him happiness, sprang
in reality from those three people. At least, it is true that
afterwards one person only was to influence him so deeply, and
for two others only was he to care with such strong endurance as
he did for his mother and for John Herries. But it was his
character that was, in the main, to settle the result of events
for him, as it does with all of us. What he was he was partly
born, partly formed by people and events, partly fashioned by his
own free will.</p>

<p>During those five years he lived, as all small boys do, a kind
of under-water life with his own particular anemones, sea-horses,
coloured weeds and stones for his absorbed attention. Of the
traffic of the waters above his head he knew nothing; it mattered
to him not at all, of course, that Mr Canning, staying with John
Gladstone in his Liverpool home, watched a small boy called
William Ewart playing on the lawn, or that there was a skirmish
at Missolonghi, or that taxation grew ever higher and higher,
that men and women cursed the machines that were taking the bread
from their mouths, that the word 'Reform' was becoming an
ever-louder battle-cry on men's lips . . .</p>

<p>He was always to have a great capacity for choosing at once
the things that would, he thought, be useful to him and rejecting
all the rest. From the very first he went his own way, and this
independence was the beginning of all his trouble with his
mother.</p>

<p>On the first occasion when he went off for a whole day without
warning, indeed without word to anyone, he was on his return in
the evening, tired, dirty and triumphant, beaten, and by his
mother. She could not but remember, as she watched him adjusting
his small trousers, the occasion so long ago when David Herries
had beaten herself, hating it more than she did. The memory made
her catch Adam to her breast and cover his face with kisses, an
act of sentimentality that was to be, on the occasions of these
punishments, her last. For she saw that he thought poorly of her
for relenting, and for a day or two despised her a little.</p>

<p>She fought her first serious battle with him over this affair.
He would neither tell her where he had been nor would he promise
her not to do it again. For an awful week it seemed to her that
her whole relationship with him was broken to pieces, until she
discovered that she was now more intimate with him than ever
before. For, when she said that she no longer wished to hear
where he had been, he told her everything. He had been in the
woods beyond Ireby, had had food with a farmer, had stroked a
wild dog that everyone else feared, had found birds' eggs and
fought a boy about tying a cat to a log and throwing stones at
it. He told her everything and then tried to convey to her that
he would always do so, but that he must have his freedom. He was
to be always very inarticulate, and when now he found that she
did not understand what he wanted, he simply fell into a complete
and unyielding silence.</p>

<p>She explained to him that if he really loved her he could not
give her anxiety and unhappiness by disappearing without telling
anyone first. He wanted to say that if he told anyone he would be
prevented from going and that therefore it was plain that no one
must be told, but this was too deeply complicated for him, so he
said nothing. Then she, the least sentimental of women,
descended, in her distress, to the desperate expedient of asking
him whether he loved her or no, and he, who loved her with all
his being, disliked so profoundly to speak about his feelings
that he said nothing at all. He, being seven, was not, of course,
aware of his reasons for these things. He simply knew that he was
hungry, that his posterior was sore where his mother had struck
him, that he hated to be questioned, that he had had a grand day,
and that he would go off again in a similar manner as soon as
opportunity offered itself.</p>

<p>Judith was a sensible woman and she had an especial talent for
understanding other people. This was not 'other people' but her
own flesh and blood, and, just as forty years ago she had climbed
out of the window and ridden away to Uncle Tom Gauntry at Stone
Ends, so now her son Adam must also be free.</p>

<p>She did the wisest thing--she left the whole matter to Mr
Rackstraw. This was, in fact, very remarkable on her part, for at
this time in England the great parental movement for the proper
discipline and benefit of the children was just beginning to
achieve force and power. All the children of England were
learning to say 'Sir' and 'Ma'am' to their parents, never to
speak before they were spoken to, and to ask questions in the
manner of Little Henry--but Judith was never like other people,
and their ways would never be hers.</p>

<p>Mr Rackstraw had from the first a strong influence over Adam.
He was a man made up of very striking opposites. In appearance he
was a little, wiry fellow with a face like a slumbering coal,
red, dusky and shadowed ash-colour. He had a broken nose and
sparse sandy hair. No beauty, but with clear bright eyes and a
lively mouth. He wore always rough country clothes, his legs were
a little bowed, and did he wear a straw in his mouth would have
been the perfect hostler. Nevertheless, he was beyond mistake or
question a gentleman. His rather sharp voice that would crack in
moments of excitement, his eyes, the way that he carried his
head, and the fine aristocratic shape of his hands told you that.
He was, in fact, of a very good family, the Rackstraws of
Rackstraw Manor in Rutlandshire, and his elder brother was Sir
Wilfred Rackstraw, 14 Mount Street, London, and some minor
official in the Foreign Office. He told you these things if you
asked him, said the Rackstraws were poorer than mice, and that he
had also a brother a smuggling trader on the Whitehaven coast.
Whether this last were so no one ever knew. But he certainly had
some very odd friends and some very mixed tastes. There was not a
farmer, hostler, stableman, huntsman, poacher in the district he
didn't know. But he was on social terms too with the County
families--the Osmastons, the Derricks, the Tennants. He was an
intimate friend of old Miss Pennyfeather, and they cracked jokes
continually: he often took a dish of tea with Mr Southey and,
they said, knew as much about his library as he did himself.
There was not a cock fight, a football match, a boxing match that
he did not attend, and yet he gave himself nobly to the two boys,
John and Adam. His passion was for Homer, and Adam owed that at
least--that the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> were to be
ever friendly companions to him because of Roger Rackstraw. He
had a pretty sense too of the virtues of Virgil, Horace,
Thucydides and the Greek dramatists, and could make them live
under his fingers. He had a poor opinion of contemporary English
Letters, although he said a good word for the <i>Waverley</i>
romances and told everyone that there was a young poet, John
Keats, who would be remembered. For Mr Wordsworth he had more
praise than was locally considered reasonable, but when alone
with a friend confessed that he thought Southey's poetry
'fustian'.</p>

<p>However, his great and abiding passion was for this country in
which he lived, and it was here that he and Adam had their great
meeting-place. He was not a local bumpkin, of course, and his
principal charm for Jennifer was that he seemed to have ever at
his fingers' ends all the London gossip. He was always very
courteous and tender to Jennifer, as though he felt that she
needed protection and guarding. It might be too that she appealed
to him, for, over fifty though she was, she was yet beautiful in
a sort of tumbling-to-pieces, letting-herself-go fashion, and he
would say, to the end of his days, that he never anywhere else
saw dark hair and fair complexion to match Jennifer Herries'.</p>

<p>He would sit in the parlour and tell her things, how Brougham
after the Queen's death, defending his not going with the body to
Brunswick, had said: 'It was well known through the whole of the
business he had never been much for the Queen' (and a dirty tyke
Brougham was, said Mr Rackstraw); how Castlereagh's suicide was
because of a pernicious blackmail that he had suffered under, how
the King now is become an awful bore and talks about nothing but
his old age, how Lady Holland persecuted her guests with her
odious cats that were for ever scratching and clawing, how the
King was seen somewhere walking with his arm round Canning's
neck, how scarcely anyone went now to Lady Jersey's parties, and
that the gambling saloon in St James' Street was the most
splendid ever known and that young William Lennox and others were
certainly being ruined there . . .</p>

<p>These were Jennifer's happiest hours, when lazily sitting
before the fire, warming her beautiful hands, she could, without
moving, transport herself into a world where indeed she did not
wish herself to be, but about whose movements she was never weary
of hearing.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was to Adam and Judith that Rackstraw was
closest. He seemed to understand Judith exactly, submitted to her
domination but treated her with a sort of quizzical honesty that
she found delightful.</p>

<p>It was Adam, perhaps, whom he really loved, although he never
showed him much liking, treated him often with roughness, lost
his temper with him completely (and then he would shout and swear
like a trooper) and ordered him about when he wished as though
the boy were his slave. He understood, however, the child's
passion for independence, and it was he who persuaded Judith to
buy him his pony, Benjamin, and never, after one of the boy's
disappearances, did he reproach or punish him. It was the rule,
as Adam well understood, that if he went off alone he must be
always back again by nightfall. He made, himself, many
expeditions with the boy. These were the grandest occasions of
Adam's life. Rackstraw taught him to see the country rightly. It
was a country, he said, of <i>clouds</i> and <i>stones.</i> Stone
walls, grey clouds, stone-coloured seagulls on dark fields like
fragments of white stone, streaks of snow in winter thin cloth of
stone, and above these stony crags pinnacles of stone, needles of
stone, piercing a stony sky. He learnt to see a small imprisoned
valley, wind-swept, as a living thing subject to growth and decay
like himself. Through this vale twisted the mountain torrent,
fighting with stones, letting its life be dominated by these
piling stones that heaped themselves one on another, that fell in
showers down the hillside, that at length perhaps choke the life
of the stream and form a stony pathway that leads at last to new
shapes of grass and moss and fern. The clouds feeding the
streams, the streams fighting the stones, life moving ceaselessly
from form to form, from pattern to pattern.</p>

<p>He learnt that it was impossible to live in this country,
loving it, without having always in his heart the colour and
shape of clouds. When, later, the drive of his life carried him
to the South, he brought the clouds with him: he was never again
to be rid of them. He knew all their patterns, forms and
vagaries. He knew the clouds that flew in flags and pinions of
flame and smoke over the brow of the hill, driven forward as
though by gigantic bellows, he knew the moth-coloured clouds that
with soft persistence gathered like great boneless birds around
the peak of a hill, he knew the clouds of rose and silver that
lay in little companies against a sky of jade in winter above
sun-drenched snow, he knew the fierce arrogant clouds of jet and
indigo that leapt upon a pale sky and swallowed it, he knew the
gay troops of cloud that danced and quivered around the sun, he
knew the shining clouds that the moon, orange-ringed, gathered
round her on a frosty night when the hoar glittered on the grass
and the only sound under the black trees was the chatter of the
running streams. The clouds were of themselves reason enough why
this country was first for him in the world.</p>

<p>But Rackstraw taught him also detail and reality. He learnt to
know ash and oak, birch and thorn, holly and hazel. He knew about
the cutting of the coppice woods for firewood and for 'spills'
and how it was 'coaled', and what was a 'stander' and what a
'yarding', and from what woods houses of 'crucks' were made, and
what 'dotard' oaks were. He learnt to know every variety of rain,
from the stampede when it comes down like animals rushing a
thicket to the murmur and whisper of a hesitating shower. He knew
how sudden gusts would come as though someone threw a bucket of
water at you, and again how it would be as though you walked down
a staircase of rain, catching your breath for a pause, slowing up
on the step's very edge while the water trickled under you.</p>

<p>During those five years he went on many rides with Rackstraw,
and sometimes they would be away two nights, sometimes three, and
once and again a whole week, he on Benjamin, and Rackstraw on his
bony ugly horse Satan. He remembered all that he saw. He had in
his heart and brain for evermore the Brathay, set in its
circumference of meadowland, the view like a crumpled
handkerchief from Pike o' Stickle, the cold, haunting loneliness
of Black Sail, the glassy perfection of Small Water, the fall of
screes from Melbreak, the sudden flight of birds so that the sky
seemed darkened at Ravenglass, the long stretch of shore pale and
lucent towards Whitehaven, the evil cleft of Simon Nick whose
ghost seemed ever to be watching from the thin darkness, the
great view from Yewdale to the Old Man, the Roman Fort on Hard
Knott, the grand silence of Waswater where the Screes, the
proudest of all the hills, plunge scornfully into unknown
depths--these and hundreds more were to be his companions for
ever.</p>

<p>He knew the dalesmen, their wives, sons, daughters, dogs,
horses and cows; he knew the Herdwick sheep as though he were one
of them. He knew the birds, the golden eagles, soon to be gone
for ever, the osprey, the dull heavy kite, the redshanks and
larks, the fishing cormorant. He felt like his own the flight of
the peregrine, the black-and-white wheat-ear, and the mocking
little cry of the sandpiper as it flitted in front of him along
the Lake's edge. The kingfisher and the moorhen spoke to him, one
of rushing water, the other of pools so still that the reflection
of a cloud on their surface was like a whisper.</p>

<p>And all the singers--the willow-wren, the chiff-chaff, the
blackcap, the whitethroat, the tree-pipit--he mocked and imitated
and whistled to.</p>

<p>From all this life there came three lives--one, the life of
the outer country; two, the life of his home, the building of
Fell House, the village and the moor; three, the personal life
with the human beings around him; and from all the events that
occurred to him during those five years three were of particular
importance. One, the affair at Watendlath, was the matter of a
moment--and it was thus.</p>

<p>In all these five years he went over only on three occasions
to Watendlath. This abstention was proof of itself of his love
for his mother; it was because of her that he did not go more
often, for he loved Watendlath more than any other place on
earth. Judith never once told him that she did not wish him to
go, but he knew from the first that it made her unhappy. Why, he
wondered, would she herself never go? She cared for Charlie
Watson and the Ritsons and the Perrys. Once, looking out of
window and he standing at her side, after some trouble that she
had had with Mrs Quinney, she burst out: 'Why am I tied here? I
am missing my whole life!' and he knew that she was thinking of
Watendlath. She never mentioned the place. Once or twice Charlie
Watson rode over to Uldale, but his visits were very brief. He
seemed constrained, and even to Adam he was sharp and curt.</p>

<p>It was on the third occasion--a week after Adam's ninth
birthday--that the strange thing happened. It was early autumn,
the hills were on fire with colour above the grey stone, the dead
bracken flamed, and the Tarn, rocked by a little wind, was
scattered with tiny feathery waves. Adam and Mr Rackstraw had
ridden over and stayed the night with the Ritsons. Charlie Watson
never appeared, although the Ritsons said that they had told him
that Adam was coming. So it was an unsatisfactory visit, for
without Watson Watendlath was only half alive. Moreover, even the
Ritsons seemed to be not quite so friendly as they had been.
Adam, who was quick for a little boy, fancied that they were
offended because his mother had not been to see them, and in arms
as he always was if he thought that his mother was attacked, he
attempted some sort of defence, but only made things the worse,
for Alice Perry smiled and said she knew that Mrs Paris was busy,
she had heard that she had much to do: they all called her
'Madame' now, she had heard, a kind of foreign way of calling a
person, and, of course, were she busy they could not expect her
to come all the way to Watendlath, and so on, and so on. Everyone
began to speak of other things.</p>

<p>This made Adam angry and he went down, a rather desolate
little figure, in the late afternoon to the Tarn alone. The wind
had died; mists were rising. The sky that had been cloudless all
day was frosty white, and the amber of the hills was fading into
dun. Behind him sheep moved, like a concrete part of the dusk, up
the slope. He was cold, lonely and disturbed by a sense of having
betrayed his mother in coming here. He wanted to go home: he
would rather not stay the night in the farm. The Perry boys,
although they had known him since he was a baby, were stiff with
him. And where was Charlie Watson? Why had he not ridden over? He
wanted to go home.</p>

<p>Standing there, looking at the Tarn, he had the sense for the
first time (it was to return to him very often) of being outside
himself. He could see every movement that he made and he felt
that, if that boy threw himself into the Tarn and disappeared,
Adam Paris would still be there, nor would he feel any loss. It
went so far that he pinched his arm to see whether he were real.
Then he threw stones into the Tarn. The noise of the splash
echoed in his ears, but even that was unreal--as though someone
else, far from himself and having no relation to himself, had
thrown the stones.</p>

<p>It was then that directly in front of him, rising from the
Tarn, he saw a figure on a white horse. While he looked the
figure grew clearer--a man in odd clothes, a black hat, and under
the hat a wig. He wore a long, heavy, purple riding-coat, and
down one spare thin cheek ran a deep scar. This man was quite
clear to him in every detail to the silver buttons on his coat.
He was not looking at Adam but away, gravely, up into the hills.
Neither horse nor rider made any movement. They were like
coloured shapes painted on the mist. Then they vanished. That was
his grandfather, who had lived, years ago, below the hills at
Rosthwaite. He had talked of him to his mother so often and had
asked so many questions about him that he knew exactly how he
would look, and in later days he might realize that it was his
own imagination, at that moment of loneliness and longing for his
mother, that had conjured up the figure.</p>

<p>But now he was only a small boy who believed in ghosts and
pixies, warlocks and witches. So for once in his life he took to
his heels and ran and ran until he arrived breathless in the warm
and lighted kitchen.</p>

<p>He never told anyone of what he thought he had seen, but that
night in bed, listening to the snores of Mr Rackstraw, he was
comforted as though he had made a new friend.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The second affair concerned John, and this was one of the most
dreadful half-hours of Adam's life, dreadful because he was not
at this time old enough to meet the emotion that he encountered.
When mature things break in upon childhood a picture is broken, a
view destroyed; the picture and view never quite return.</p>

<p>Adam was nearly ten when this thing happened, and John
seventeen and a half.</p>

<p>Their friendship had by now grown so close that they were more
than brothers. They had the intimacy with that edge of
strangeness and interest belonging to a friendship that has no
blood relationship.</p>

<p>John had caught and held Adam in the only way that he could
catch and hold him--by demanding his protection. He did not
consciously demand it: this had grown out of Adam's fearlessness
and John's sensitiveness. John was handsome beyond all ordinary
standards; he was the best-looking young fellow, it was generally
admitted, in the County. He was tall, slender, fair, with a
straight carriage and an air of such breeding that when he moved
both men and women unconsciously watched him, feeling perhaps
that he was of a different strain from the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>When he came into a place he walked haughtily and seemed
proud, his head erect, his mouth sternly set, but at once, when
he was in contact with another human being, his smile shone out,
lighting up his face. His proud carriage sprang from an
intolerable shyness that he could never overcome. It was agony to
him to meet new people or anyone of whose kindliness he was not
sure. At any unfriendliness he flung on instantly an armour of
reserve. With the men and women about the place he was in perfect
relations; they all loved him and would do anything for him. His
beauty seemed to them something rare and wonderful, and when they
knew him also to be so gentle and kind they served him without
further question. Nevertheless, he was no commander of men; any
tale of distress touched him, however false it might be. He
believed what he was told, and when he was deceived thought that
it was some wrong in himself that had caused the deceit.</p>

<p>It was here that Adam, whom even when he was so young a child
he trusted and loved as he trusted and loved none other,
protected him. Adam was uncouth and rough beside him. He did not
grow more handsome as he grew older. The darkness of his hair,
the brown of his face and body, made him seem someone foreign and
apart. He wore always the roughest country clothes. He spoke,
when he did speak, with a slight Cumberland 'burr', he was often
silent when he ought to speak and would look at people with a
sort of frown as though he were summing them up. His worst fault
was exactly the opposite of John's, namely, that he suspected
everyone until he had proved his case.</p>

<p>It became plain to him soon that John was his charge. In spite
of the difference of their ages he was already wiser about the
world than John and, because he was not sensitive and because
hostility only made him hostile in return and because he was
afraid of no one, he was a good bodyguard.</p>

<p>Only one thing at this time came between the two of them. A
chance meeting brought them into contact with Uhland, Walter's
son. Adam had long ago decided that Walter Herries was his enemy
and the enemy of all those whom he loved. He was not aware,
during these years, of the developing battle between Walter
Herries and his mother, but he did know that everything round
Westaways was enemy country.</p>

<p>The queer thing was that Uhland, who was Adam's age, never
missed an occasion of an encounter with Adam if one were
possible. They met but seldom, in the Keswick street, once and
again at the Hunt, at a sheep trial, at a running-match: once
when Adam was fishing by himself beyond Crosthwaite Church,
Uhland, unattended, came limping through the field. He stood
looking at Adam, apparently afraid to speak. Adam would have had
nothing to do with him, but the boy was lame, his face was pale,
he seemed so sickly that it was a wonder he could move at all. So
he spoke, and Uhland came and sat beside him. What followed was
most uncomfortable, for Uhland sat there, staring out of large
protruding eyes, and said nothing.</p>

<p>At last he felt in his jacket and offered Adam a top, a large
one coloured green and crimson. Adam did not wish to take it, but
Uhland clambered to his feet and went limping away across the
field without another word . . .</p>

<p>Now John had from the very first the strangest fear of Uhland.
There was something about his deformity and sickliness that
affected him as though the boy had a disease that he could convey
to others. He saw him on the rarest occasions, but he was often
conscious of him, would, in the middle of the night, think of
that leg longer than the other, those protruding eyes, the little
body that seemed to be bent by a head too big for it.</p>

<p>Once he burst out passionately to Adam and wished him to
promise never to speak to Uhland again.</p>

<p>'But I don't speak to him,' said Adam, astonished.</p>

<p>'You meet him. He talked to you in Keswick a fortnight
back.'</p>

<p>'He has a horse,' said Adam irrelevantly. 'It is called
Caesar. It's coal black with a white star on its forehead.'</p>

<p>'I tell you,' John repeated, 'you are not to talk with
him.'</p>

<p>'Why not?' asked Adam.</p>

<p>John could not say. The boy and his father hated them, would
do them any harm . . .</p>

<p>But Adam fell into one of his silences. John would not speak
to him for days.</p>

<p>Then came this terrible distressing thing.</p>

<p>It came like a door banging on to a silent room. It was in the
early summer. Adam had been riding, had shut Benjamin into his
box, stroked his nose and talked some nonsense to him, then very
happy, whistling out of tune, had wandered into the house. He had
a room to himself now, one that he had chosen, an attic with a
slanting roof and a fine view over the moor to the slopes of
Skiddaw. He and Skiddaw were now on speaking terms, and there was
nothing about Skiddaw that Adam didn't know--or so he
thought.</p>

<p>He had but just sat down upon his bed and was thinking of the
coach that had passed him with a fine tantivy and a grand cloud
of dust from the horses' hoofs, thinking perhaps that he would
like to see the world a bit, when the door opened and John came
in. He stood without moving. He had been paying some visit and
was dressed very smartly in a claret-coloured coat, the hips and
chest padded, a white frill, his dark chestnut trousers strapped
under his boots. Adam remembered then that, urged by Judith, John
had been to call on some people with a house on the border of
Bassenthwaite Lake. They were called Sanderson and were new
arrivals in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He stood there, his face pale, his lips quivering. He crossed
to the bed, sat down by Adam, then to Adam's horror burst out
crying, his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Adam put his arm around him and sat there, not knowing what to
do or say. He had never seen John cry before, and that a man
should shed tears seemed to him an awful thing.</p>

<p>'What is it? . . . What's the matter, John?' he said at last,
his voice a funny broken bass from his emotion. For a long while
John, crying desperately, made no answer.</p>

<p>Adam stared out of the window at Skiddaw and watched birds
flying slowly, dreamily, across the faint glassy sky.</p>

<p>This is what it is . . .' John caught Adam's hand. 'My
mother--' He hesitated, then the words poured out of him. 'I had
visited the Sandersons. Young Robert Sanderson was there. He is a
friend of Cousin Walter's, and I could not abide him from the
first. He was affronted by something I had said in the house
about the Catholics in Ireland, that the Catholic laws were
monstrous and that we should have shame for our treatment of
Ireland . . . He answered hotly, and when I left came out with me
to my horse. He sneered at something I said. You know how it
is--I hate a quarrel. I answered him gently, and then he said
something about the fine man Cousin Walter was, and that by what
he had heard Fell House here should be his. That was too much for
me and I called Cousin Walter what he is--a damnable blackguard.
Then Sanderson told me . . . he said . . . he said it was common
knowledge that because my mother had been a man's mistress here
and because my father had found them together, therefore my
father had killed himself in London. Because my father had been a
coward and allowed that man to come to this house, to sleep here
. . . he knew of it. The whole world knew . . . I struck
Sanderson in the face--and I rode away.'</p>

<p>Telling his story had calmed him. He caught his breath. His
face now was as white as a peeled stick, his body trembled, but
he wept no longer.</p>

<p>'Everyone knows--has known for years. Only I didn't know . .
.'</p>

<p>They were quiet for a long time. Adam's hand tightened on
John's. He could not bear to feel John's body tremble. He longed
to do anything for him, to rush out and trample on Sanderson, to
burn Uncle Walter's house down, to . . . Oh! He knew not what!
But he could neither do anything nor say anything. He was not
ignorant, young though he was. He knew--in a child's way--about
men and women, without feeling that all those things, the making
of love, the birth of children, were real in a real world. But he
understood that this was a disgraceful and terrible thing.
Nevertheless his own active feelings were those of rage against
Sanderson and a passionate instinct to defend John.</p>

<p>He said at last in a husky voice:</p>

<p>'I expect he's a liar. They are all liars, friends of Uncle
Walter's.'</p>

<p>'No--it's true . . . I have known for a long while that mother
was afraid, afraid of everything, of Cousin Walter and people in
Keswick--and that my father had shot himself in London, but this
. . .'</p>

<p>Then he added, still shivering as though with an intense
cold:</p>

<p>'I must fight Sanderson.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you must kill him,' Adam answered eagerly. Here was
something that he could do. 'Mr Rackstraw shall help us.'</p>

<p>'Cousin Walter put him on to this: I know he did. Everything
we do, everywhere we go, Walter Herries is at our back. Oh, God,
if I could do him an injury for all he's done to us! And now I
know. I know why he has so much power over us, why my mother
fears him as she does . . . My father was a coward, my mother . .
.'</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>'Adam, you must speak of this to no one. We will settle
Sanderson's affair ourselves. But that everyone should know, that
they have known for years . . .'</p>

<p>Adam said, nodding his head:</p>

<p>'If it's pistols, John, you can kill him. Mr Rackstraw says
you're the best shot with a pistol for your age in Cumberland.
We'll practise in the barn. We'll go now . . .'</p>

<p>But nothing came of it then. They learnt that young Sanderson
had gone South. He never answered John's letter, and later,
joining his regiment, went abroad. The consequences were not so
easily settled. After that summer afternoon nothing was the same
again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam's third affair concerned his mother.</p>

<p>As those years passed, Judith dominated Fell House and its
neighbourhood ever more completely.</p>

<p>When Adam was eleven, in 1826, Judith was nearly fifty-two.
Now fifty-two was considered in those days a great age for a
woman. There were old women like Mrs Tennant of Ireby who were
old women, sat in a chair and had the air of prophetesses. There
were old women like Mrs Summerson in Keswick who played cards
night and day but were nevertheless old women. There were old
women like Mrs Clare of Portinscale who rode to hounds, cursed
and swore, drank and gambled, chaffed with the stable-boys, but
were still old women. Judith Paris was unique. After settling in
command at Fell House she seemed with every month to grow
younger. Her body, taut, neat, active, appeared not to know
fatigue. Her hair, once so lovely an auburn, was now grey, her
face, always pale in colour (and she would use no paint as most
of the older women did), knew no wrinkle. She rode a horse like a
commander. She was austere and direct when about her business,
but she could behave suddenly like a girl. She went to dances,
card-parties, hunts, balls in Keswick. She was known everywhere
as 'Madame,' famous for her kindness, her sharp and direct
speech, her common sense. She had not changed in her
impulsiveness, her attention to business, her loyalty, her
childish pleasure in little things. Only those who knew her well
were aware that something she had had was now, to all appearance,
gone. It might be dead, it might be hidden. Miss Pennyfeather in
Keswick knew, Jennifer unperceptively was aware . . . Jennifer
said that Judith was no longer romantic.</p>

<p>Another thing that everyone knew about her was that she was
'mad' about her boy. Of course the boy was illegitimate, although
everyone could name his father, but his illegitimacy and the fact
that Judith herself was the daughter of old 'Rogue' Herries (now
a legend: they said that his ghost 'walked' in Borrowdale) and a
gipsy, made the mother and son something apart. 'Madame' was
becoming a legend like her father. Every kind of tale was told of
her. When she came into a room people stared and whispered. But
they invited her, they admired her; she was a 'character' and did
the neighbourhood a sort of credit.</p>

<p>We are in part what our friends and neighbours make us and,
unconsciously, Judith began at this time to respond to the demand
for her to be 'queer'. Her dress was a little extravagant. Her
skirts were very full in the Dutch fashion. She liked gay colours
and was often seen in a shawl of red cashmere. She had hats of
fine straw worn over a lace cap--far too young for another of her
age, but in some way not ridiculous for her. Her turbans of
figured gauze at an evening party were magnificent. She already
carried the cane of white ivory that was, later, to be so famous.
People in Keswick said, 'Madame is coming,' and gathered at shop
doors and windows to look.</p>

<p>She ruled everyone in Fell House save her son Adam. It was at
the beginning of his twelfth year that she put her power over him
to the test and failed. This occasion was one of the great crises
that marked his boyhood.</p>

<p>No one knew with what passionate emotion she loved this child.
Everything else that was dear to her she had surrendered--save
her love of power and her love of son. As he grew her feeling for
him developed into a mingling of love, admiration and
exasperation. She had always wished for him to be independent and
apart from other boys. His father, poor Warren, had had but too
little character. Adam seemed to have no resemblance at all to
his father; he was his mother and then himself as well. He
reminded her continually of what she had been as a child, and it
was a curious irony that she should so often feel the same
bewilderment and irritation in dealing with him felt long ago by
David and Sarah Herries about herself. She learnt, very soon in
their relationship, that he hated any kind of demonstration. Did
he love her or did he not? She knew that he did, and with all his
heart, but any expression of affection silenced and removed him.
But he <i>must</i> obey her. When she had surrendered her
domination of his movements (no one knew what this cost her) she
consoled herself with the right to order him in all other
ways.</p>

<p>The exercise of power grows with what it feeds on. People
succumbed to her so easily that she came to expect it as her
right. Adam always obeyed her when he felt that her demand was
just. She had one thing more to learn--that, if he thought her
unjust, he was quite beyond her power.</p>

<p>The incident had minute beginnings. One fine morning she had
driven with Adam in the chaise to Keswick. Mr Carrick the
haberdasher came on to the pavement to receive her orders, and
after he was gone, before she could move forward, tiresome old
Major Bellenden must limp forward and, his wide-brimmed hat
gallantly in hand (although the day was cold), commence one of
his interminable conversations. Major Bellenden, who lived alone
on the road to Threlkeld, was a purple-faced old bachelor,
tyrannized over by a peevish manservant. He had served abroad,
knew the East, had had an amusing adventure or two, but all these
were swallowed up by the fact that he had been actually present
at the famous performance on February 13th, 1820, at the Paris
Opera of <i>Le Carnaval de Venise</i> when the Duc de Berry had
been assassinated. Nay, more, he had by a lucky chance left the
Opera for a moment and returned at the very instant when Louvel
planted his dagger 'up to the hilt', had heard the Duke cry 'What
a ruffian!' and then 'I have been murdered!' Later, he had
listened to the screams of pain that came from the poor Duke as
Dupuytren probed the wound, had seen Decazes enter to examine the
murderer, and best of all had even been witness of Louis XVIII
himself as, tossed about between the banisters of the stairs and
the wall, they had tried to push his chair that he might get to
the Duke. He told over and over again how the Duke, dying, raised
himself and said: 'Forgive me, dear Uncle, forgive me'; and Louis
answered: 'There is no hurry, dear Nephew. We will talk later
about this.' And then how, at the very last, when the Duchess was
filling the room with her lamentations, the Duke said: 'My
dearest, control yourself for the sake of our child,' and so gave
France the first news that there would be an heir to the Bourbons
. . .</p>

<p>So often had the Major told this very long story with all the
details of it exactly repeated, that the Duc de Berry's
assassination seemed to many persons to have occurred in Keswick.
However, 'The Old Bore and his Murder' was the general summary of
Major Bellenden.</p>

<p>It chanced that on this very morning the Major mentioned his
Duke. Some remark of Judith's about the weather reminded him. 'It
was weather like this . . . that horrid affair of the Duc de
Berry, of which I expect I have told you . . .', and looking up
caught young Adam smiling at him in a very irritating manner.
Adam had heard his mother in her lighter moments, imitating the
Major: 'I had my foot on the stair . . . Louvel must have brushed
my arm . . .' and giving then the very half-choked,
half-important guffaw that was the Major's.</p>

<p>Adam smiled, and the Major saw him smiling. His mother also
saw him. The Major was deeply hurt and went limping away.</p>

<p>During the drive homewards Judith scolded him, speaking of
reverence to age, of impertinence and other kindred matters.</p>

<p>'But, Mama, you yourself laughed . . .'</p>

<p>'Not to his face. That is bad manners.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry, Mama. Look, there is Mr Southey with--'</p>

<p>'Now listen, Adam. You are to listen. You must apologize to
the Major.'</p>

<p>Adam sat grimly silent. Of all things in the world he hated
most to apologize. The matter might on an ordinary day have
stopped there, but Judith had been irritated by a number of small
things, by the failure of Miss Pritchett, the little dressmaker
whom she patronized, to have a dress ready; by Mrs Quinney's
cold; by the customary sluggishness of Jennifer.</p>

<p>So she pursued it.</p>

<p>'Promise me, then, that you will apologize.'</p>

<p>Adam said nothing. He sat there, his mouth pursed in an
exasperating manner.</p>

<p>'Promise me that you will apologize.'</p>

<p>At last he murmured:</p>

<p>'It is unfair, Mama. You yourself laugh at him.'</p>

<p>'That is different. He was not present.'</p>

<p>Then again, as the chaise drew slowly up the hill to the
village:</p>

<p>'Say that you will apologize.'</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>'Well, then, I must punish you.'</p>

<p>Adam was enclosed in his attic for the rest of the day without
food.</p>

<p>In the evening Judith came in to him, her head held high, her
heart aching with love. She had been quite wretched all the
afternoon. She had realized with a pain that was deeper than any
emotion felt by her for many days that without Adam there was
nothing. All this business of defying Walter, of managing the
house, the servants, Jennifer, of corresponding with various
Herries all over the country, of visiting and dining and being
sociable--it was all nothing, nothing at all without Adam. She
had loved her husband, she loved Adam. There was nothing else.
And with a sudden shudder, as though a hateful wrinkled hag in a
bonnet had bowed to her in the glass, she saw her old age, of
which until now she had scarcely thought--her old age, empty,
ugly and cruel.</p>

<p>She came into his room and found him standing looking out of
the window, just as, centuries ago, she had stood at her window
when David was to beat her. He did not turn. She put her hand on
his shoulder. She was, not by much, taller than he, but when he
turned her heart leapt, for he was so lovely to her, so utterly
her own, so proud and so strong, just as she would have him
be.</p>

<p>But he was relentless--and he was utterly beyond her reach.
She said something. She asked him to come downstairs. No, he
would not come down. Did he not see that he was wrong, that he
had hurt the feelings of an old man, that it was proper to offer
an apology when one had shown bad manners?</p>

<p>'I did not show bad manners,' Adam said, not looking at
her.</p>

<p>She did not know it, but he himself was terrified--terrified
at this resentment that he felt to her, his rebellion as though
he were fighting for something very serious and important. He had
never felt like this to her before. He almost hated her.</p>

<p>'Well, then, you will see it later on. You will see that I am
right. Come down now and we will not speak of it.'</p>

<p>But it could not be settled in that way. His dreadful silence
which he himself hated dominated him. She put her arm around his
neck.</p>

<p>'Come, Adam.'</p>

<p>He dragged himself away from her and went back to the window,
looking out. That infuriated her and she surrendered to one of
her old tempests of passion. She stormed and stamped her feet. He
was ungrateful, hard, unloving, disobedient. She had done
everything for him, and thus he repaid her. Well, he should see.
She was not to be insulted by a child. He should be beaten. Maybe
that would teach him . . .</p>

<p>'Beat me,' he said, turning round upon her.</p>

<p>They looked at one another, each with hatred. The look was so
terrible, so new, so far from anything that either of them had
thought possible, that in another moment they would have been in
one another's arms.</p>

<p>But she did nothing, said nothing, and after a moment left the
room.</p>

<p>When she had gone he sat, swinging his legs, the unhappiest
boy in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h1><a name="c104">THE SUMMER FAIR</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The scarlet cloak of Oberon cast hastily on the daisied sward
of the meadow, the laughter of the fairies as they fled towards
the wood, the young men as they waited by the church gate,
straining forward, listening for the word to go, the strange
orange turban of Miss Pennyfeather, the breaking lights of violet
and crimson as the fireworks burst above the Lake, the clown
standing on his head in the market-place, his calves brown as
berries against the sunlight, the line of chaises, barouches,
waggons, the gauze and linen of the coloured dresses shining as
the ladies leant forward from their carriages to watch the
runners pass, the roseate haze on Skiddaw as the reflection of
the setting sun threw great lines of colour across the crowded
meadow, the peal of the bells from Crosthwaite Church, the
gipsies with gaudy rings, crimson kerchiefs, white teeth flashing
as they told fortunes in their encampment below the wood, Titania
tearing her frail petticoat as she climbed the cart to ride
through the town, the riot of men and women after dusk under the
stars when a kind of madness seized the place, sunlight, bells,
babel of voices, scents of flowers, neighing of horses, the
plashing of oars upon the water, the stars and the flare of
torches--for days and months and years the smoking shadow of this
life was to hang about Keswick.</p>

<p>It was in August of 1827 that the famous Summer Fair came,
blazed, vanished. For years afterwards it was remembered; for
years now it has been as though it never was. And yet the town
had known nothing like it before unless it were the famous
Chinese Fair of nearly a century earlier. There is no record of
it. Search contemporary journals and you will find nothing. For
it came, it went, as many of the finest things in life come and
go, by accident; it is only a background to the history of
certain private lives; a handkerchief was dropped, a horse
stumbled, a word was spoken. In a week the meadow was itself
again, the waters of the Lake were calm, the gipsies were in
Carlisle, the booths were piled boards, the bell-ringers were
practising for another ceremony, the Strolling Players were
drinking in a Kendal inn.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was never anything like it again. Chance,
Mrs Bonaventure, sunshine, the accidental passing of the gipsies
and the Players, stars and a full moon made this thing.</p>

<p>Mrs Bonaventure had come to Keswick six months before. She was
a large stout lady with a red face, a roaring voice, and a
wealthy husband almost as large as herself. They were a jolly
pair, vulgar, if you like, with their loud voices and
carelessness of social divisions, but it was known that she was
the daughter of a Lancashire baronet, so, as Mrs Osmaston said,
'You can be sure she can speak quietly when she wishes,' and they
were generous, crazy for parties and picnics and dances, and
thought there was no place in the world like Keswick . . .</p>

<p>It was she who first had the notion of a F&ecirc;te. It was in
some way to be connected with the hand-loom weaving, and in some
way with the birth of a baby boy to her sister who lived in
Rutlandshire, and in some way with the Duke of Wellington, and in
some way with a prize that Mr Bonaventure was giving for a race
for young men under twenty-five, a race from Crosthwaite Church
to the Druids' Circle.</p>

<p>In any case, there must be a F&ecirc;te.</p>

<p>There should be booths along Main Street with gingerbread and
apples and toffee. There should be dancing in the moonlight.
There should be no nasty sports like bull-baiting or
cock-fighting. There should be decorated boats on the Lake, and
fireworks. She did not know that some Strolling Players chanced
to be performing in Penrith. She did not know about the gipsies.
All these delights were added unto her.</p>

<p>Suppose that old Herries, remembering as he must that Chinese
Fair, when in an eating booth he had sold his lady for a few
pieces of silver, were present, perched cross-legged on a
chimney, standing upright against a tree top, what would he think
of it all? A hundred years gone (but time is of course nothing to
him now), and yet here was his daughter, like a little general,
marshalling her family forces, and here his great-grandson Walter
commanding <i>his</i> battalions, and behind them, around them,
all the lively consequences, male and female, of that wild
turbulent life by which <i>he</i> had once been surrounded! Yes,
wild and turbulent that Chinese Fair had been, civilized and
gentle <i>this</i> Fair must seem to him--but the same battle was
joined now as then, and so will be, for ever and ever, change the
background as you may, for ever and ever, amen!</p>

<p>As his long sardonic person wanders now skywards, now mingling
unseen with the crowd, now peering sardonically from behind the
chimneypot, he watches that same daughter with tenderness maybe,
and young John and Adam and Elizabeth with concern, and
great-grandson Walter with humorous sarcasm, watches and grimly
smiles and vanishes into a star, wondering why they should all be
so serious over a matter so brief and trivial.</p>

<p>For the rest, how are they, in reminiscence, to break that
confusing fantastic day into some sort of shape and order:
morning, afternoon, evening and the moonlight night?--or, better
than that, they divide it by event--the boats on the Lake, the
race through the town, the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,</i> the
dancing on the meadow--four cantos of a happy poem.</p>

<br>


<p align="CENTER">THE BOATS ON THE LAKE</p>

<br>


<p>By eight of the morning the booths were lining Main Street,
the children were dancing like mad things down the road, the sun
was blazing (for they had all the luck that day) and boats were
putting out from the Islands, from Manesty, from Lodore, from
Grange. By ten o'clock the carriages were rolling up, from
Penrith and Ullswater and Newlands and Bassenthwaite, from
Carlisle even, from Grasmere and Rydal, from Shap and Hawkshead.
Very early in the morning for some of them the horses must have
been led from their stables and the coaches loaded. Many came in
pillion-riding as for hundreds of years they had done, while the
grander farmers were proud in the 'shandy-carts'. Keswick,
although Crosthwaite Church had not yet begun its peal, was
ringing with bells, for teams of pack-horses, used for the
carrying of pieces from the hand-loom weaving, came jingling in.
Many of the women who were spreading their apples, nuts, cakes
and bottles of herb beer on the trestles had been many a time to
Hell Gill Bridge for the Brough Hill Fair, and with that same
jingling of bells came the scents and sounds from Shaw Paddock
and Aisgill and the old Thrang Bridge in Mallerstang.</p>

<p>But it was down by the Lake that the day was to begin. The sun
lay on the water like a caressing hand, and the hills, from Walla
Crag, from the Borrowdale peaks, from Cat Bells and Robinson,
reflected their colour and proud forms as though they had another
life beneath their glassy waters.</p>

<p>Mrs Bonaventure, attended by husband and friends, was soon
seated like a queen on the commanding perch of Friar's Crag. She
loved fine colours. She wore a hat as broad nearly as her
shoulders, and from it waved four large ostrich feathers. Her
dress, magnificently full, was a brilliant orange.</p>

<p>Very soon the borders of the Lake were thronged with figures,
and the water whispered with the soft splash of oars. Across the
meadows and trees suddenly broke out the bells from Crosthwaite,
and from the landing-stage the blast of the Town Band. A gun was
fired from the Island. The F&ecirc;te was begun.</p>

<p>It was just before midday, when every eye was straining to see
the first boat round the corner of the Island, that the party
from Westaways arrived. Walter himself drove his coach from the
house to the end of the Lake Road, and as his four horses
galloped up Main Street everyone cheered and the little boys
turned cartwheels and the pigeons flew in exulting circles above
their heads.</p>

<p>Walter was elegant indeed as he flourished his whip decorated
with coloured streamers, his many-caped riding-coat of green high
above his thick neck, his chest thrust out, his head up as though
to say: 'You may claim this or that for your glory today, but
here is the true centre of the affair!' He had in the coach with
him his wife, his children and his relations. It was a piece of
fortune that these relations were present to witness his
splendour, for it was only chance that the young sons of Durward
Herries were passing through from Edinburgh and that James
Herries (at length, after many years of weary waiting, succeeding
to his old father's baronetcy) had come over from York.</p>

<p>But there they were: the two boys with two Oxford
undergraduate friends from a house near Carlisle, and Sir James
Herries, Bart., puffed out with solemn pride and complacent
satisfaction. Agnes was there too, and also Uhland and
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>After leaving the coach they walked, a cluster of splendour,
to the Lake's edge.</p>

<p>No one could be more genial with all the world than Walter
when things went as they ought to. He had left his riding-coat in
Posset's care, for the day would be hot, and now at the age of
thirty-five his great frame was beginning to yield at last to the
stoutness that it had so long resisted. His high hat with the
broad brim, rough in texture, was a dark wine-colour; his
claret-coloured coat, the tails sewn on separately that it might
fit his sides the better, followed the lines of his body exactly.
His neckcloth was shaped at the sides and stiffened with pig's
bristles, rising to a kind of arch at the cheeks, and at its
centre was the accustomed jewelled pin. He wore two waistcoats,
one of dark purple, the other dark grey; his trousers, tight at
the knees, widening downwards, were fawn. This must have been a
warm costume for the middle of summer, but the stuff was all of a
light material, and it was only at the neck as the day advanced
that he was uncomfortable--which may possibly have accounted for
his excitement at the end of the day: by such slender threads do
human actions hang!</p>

<p>With his clothes, his bulk, his carriage, his merry arrogance,
his vitality and <i>bonhomie,</i> he was by far the most
remarkable figure on that day. Men said afterwards that to them
this appeared the turning-point of his life--his last public
appearance before the beginning of the Fortress!</p>

<p>He stationed himself with his wife, children and friends--a
kind of resplendent patriarch--on a little green mound whence he
could watch, above the vulgar crowd, the procession of the
boats.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had the first two boats rounded the corner
of the Island before the party from Fell House arrived--'Madame',
Mrs Jennifer Herries, Adam, John and Dorothy, with Mr Rackstraw
in the background.</p>

<p>They had come almost to the water-edge before they realized
that Walter Herries and his company were stationed above them.
The people of Keswick could not be ignorant of the family
warfare, had indeed for many years now been aware of it. The most
fantastic stories were abroad: that Walter Herries had put
poisoned wine in the Fell House cellar, that he had hired
ruffians from Whitehaven to kidnap young John, that 'Madame'
herself in the dead of night had climbed in at a Westaways window
armed with a carving-knife--no tale was too absurd. Even though
the procession of boats had begun, everyone watched to see what
'Madame' would do. But 'Madame', after a moment's glance, did
nothing at all. Her Leghorn hat, trimmed with dahlias and ears of
corn, her muslin dress of lilac, should have seemed ridiculous in
a woman of her years. But she was not ridiculous, rather
wonderfully imposing, her little figure neat and strong, her hand
resting on her ivory cane, her head raised as though she ruled
the world. Jennifer Herries, in a white muslin, towered above
her, but was less impressive. Everyone said how handsome John
Herries was, that Dorothy Herries had a fresh complexion, and
that Madame's boy looked very French--the same comments were
always made.</p>

<p>If Walter had noticed Judith, he gave no sign of it. So there
they all were to watch the procession. Round the bend came the
boats, the first four with twelve oars apiece. They were all
decorated with flowers, and in three of the boats girls in white
sang to the accompaniment of harps. The oarsmen were in white
with crimson sashes at the waist. The sixth boat was a barge, and
in it seated on a throne was the Guardian of the Lake. He was a
stout old gentleman (Mr Barleycorn the hosier, in fact) with neck
bare, garlanded, his fat legs bare to above the knees, and he
carried a trident, thereby causing many of the spectators to
suppose him Neptune.</p>

<p>In the boat that followed him was enthroned the Queen of the
Lake with attendant maidens. This, as everyone knew, was Mrs
Armstrong who kept the sweet-shop just below Greta Hall. She was
a commanding woman, full-breasted, and even on quite ordinary
occasions, when selling a stick of liquorice to a small boy,
stiff with dignity. It was because of her dignity that she had
been chosen for this office.</p>

<p>In the boats that followed some licence of costume had been
permitted: there were sailors, pirates, clowns, village maidens
and Columbines. At the last there were small children carrying
bouquets of flowers and watching with uneasy glances lest at any
moment they should be precipitated into the water.</p>

<p>Oh, but it was a <i>grand</i> procession. The sun gave them
his glory, the mountains wished them well, the church bells rang
and the Town Band blared, the voices sang, and through it all the
plash, plash of the oars gave rhythm and movement to the pattern
of flowers and water and shadowed reflection.</p>

<p>They swept in a great circle, then drew up in line before the
shore. The Guardian of the Lake rose a little unsteadily in his
throne and delivered an address, not a single word of which could
be heard by anyone. Then planks were thrown from boat to boat,
and the goddess (Mrs Armstrong), 'every movement a symphony,'
walked most majestically if uncertainly to the land, followed by
her maidens, then by the little children, and last by the
shouting rabble of sailors, clowns and Columbines.</p>

<p>Everyone now was shouting, everyone was singing; everyone
rushed in unison together up to the field behind, where Mrs
Bonaventure was to receive the King and Queen.</p>

<p>'Very pretty,' said Judith. 'Very pretty indeed.'</p>

<p>'Very handsome,' said Walter Herries, coming from his green
mound. He took off his wine-coloured hat and bowed.</p>

<p>'Good day, Walter,' said Judith, looking him steadily in the
face.</p>

<p>He smiled and seemed a boy of eighteen.</p>

<p>'I hope you are well,' he said.</p>

<p>'Never felt better,' answered Judith.</p>

<p>'We have a fine day.'</p>

<p>'An excellent day.'</p>

<p>Sir James bowed. Judith inclined her head.</p>

<p>Walter's party moved on.</p>

<p>Young Garth Herries asked a question.</p>

<p>'That, my boy,' answered Walter, 'is a relation of yours--and
the most remarkable woman in England.'</p>

<br>


<p align="CENTER">THE RACE THROUGH THE TOWN</p>

<br>


<p>As everyone knows, the men and women of the North Country have
never believed in the display of their emotions unless there is
good ground for it. They prefer to wait and see what is really
occurring before they venture an opinion. When they say a thing
they mean it, but they mean a great many things that they never
say.</p>

<p>The more extraordinary, then, was the outburst of singing and
joy as the flowery boats circled the shore. It was a spontaneous
cry as though some especial genial deity were abroad that day
who, wishing for a song and laughter, saw that it was so. (In
parenthesis: there had been up to this midday very little
drinking. That came after.)</p>

<p>Adam found himself with his mother, Dorothy and John perched
on a mound outside the churchyard wall, waiting with a great
crowd of other spectators for the race to begin. He was, if he
had cared to think of it, possibly the happiest boy in England
that day. This was what he loved--the sun, the crowds, his own
familiar country, every kind of sport and, as instinctively he
knew, his mother as happy as he was.</p>

<p>In spite of the difference in their ages, mother and son were
just now children together. This too was what Judith loved. She
had a child's passion for small things, she adored to see other
people happy. Adam's hand was in hers, and she had enjoyed her
moment's challenge with Walter. There was no sign anywhere of the
Westaways party, and she was quite certainly just then monarch of
all she surveyed. Because she was so small of stature she stood
once and again on tiptoe so that she might miss nothing. Nearly
everyone around her knew who she was, and if anyone didn't he was
certain to inquire; you couldn't catch a glimpse of her and not
be conscious of her personality. But they were all proud of her,
although they didn't quite know why. Farmers and their wives,
townsmen and statesmen and better-class smiled, nodded, said it
was a fine day, and she smiled and nodded back at all of
them.</p>

<p>Adam, as was customary with him, said little but noticed
everything. Dorothy stayed close beside her mother. At that time
young ladies stayed as close to their mothers as though they were
glued to them lest something evil should occur to them. John,
very handsome in his plum-coloured coat, was apart, as he so
often seemed to be. He was enjoying himself, but quietly and with
that slight nervous social tremor that never quite left him when
he went abroad. He did not know that within half an hour the
greatest event of his life was to occur.</p>

<p>Across the road were lined the runners, twelve of them. They
wore thin shirts open at the neck and short drawers. They were
young, strong, tanned most of them by their outdoor labour. The
two favourites were John Graham of Threlkeld, a tall, stringy
young man with a head shaped like a hammer; and Will Leathwaite
of Grange, who was short, thick and simple-eyed like a baby. Two
of the men, Tom Trimble from St John's in the Vale and Harry
Pender of Keswick, were famous runners but were older than the
others. Trimble was a giant and as broad as he was tall. His legs
and arms were hairy and his chest hirsute beneath his shirt. Good
nature beamed from him and he looked round him smiling on
everyone, although his brow was wrinkled with his serious
purpose. He towered above the others. Pender was thin and
cadaverous. He was an ill-tempered man and hated to be beaten.
Mrs Pender in the hedge near at hand waited with anxiety, for she
knew that were he defeated he would be none too pleasant a
companion that evening. Trimble's mother, an old rosy-faced woman
with a basket on her arm, kept calling out to her son to
encourage him, and he would look across the road and smile at her
and shout: 'Aye, mother, I'll do my best.'</p>

<p>Old Major Bellenden had been appointed starter, and very
self-important he was. At the stroke of the half-hour from
Crosthwaite Church clock he would shout 'One. Two. Three,' wave
the handkerchief, and off they would go.</p>

<p>Adam's hopes were resting on Will Leathwaite, the thick
simple-faced young man. He knew Will a little, for Will's father
was a friend of Bennett the coachman, and Will would on occasion
ride over from Grange or drive with a calf or farm produce. Will
was Adam's kind of a man because he spoke little, was
good-natured and afraid of nothing.</p>

<p>Then, just as all eyes were staring at the clock--it wanted
but two minutes to the half-hour--up the road came Walter and his
friends. They were hastening along, laughing and talking, making
a great deal of display. Walter strode in front; his wife,
children and the two young men followed. Room was made for them
behind the Major, who began hurriedly explaining to Walter
Herries a number of things, very important things, involved in
his official business.</p>

<p>And it was then that something happened to John. He saw, as
though for the first time, Elizabeth, Walter's young
daughter.</p>

<p>It was not, of course, for the first time. He had seen her on
several other occasions, but he had never spoken to her, and
never considered her at all. Now her loveliness rose at him from
the crowd, the cries, the fields and road as Venus rises
(constantly, we may believe) from the sea.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Herries was at this time only twelve, but she was
tall for her years. Her fair colouring, her air of shyness, her
slim erect body, above all her quietness, enchanted John. But he
could give no reasons for that sudden thundering of his heart,
that queer sense of being urged by some force around him, the
very air about him, to run forward, to touch her hand . . . He
had seen her before and she had meant nothing to him. He could
not understand it. It was an enchantment, a magical turning of
flowers and hedge, dusty road and churchyard wall into shining
glass, feathered clouds and raining gold. To run, to touch her
hand, to speak . . .</p>

<p>Then, as though he had wheeled upwards on a rising sphere from
sunlit underworlds, he caught his own state again, heard the
voices, saw the lilac stuff of Aunt Judith's dress. Walter
Herries' daughter! He raised his head and stared at the sun.</p>

<p>The clock struck, the handkerchief was waved, they were off!
And Adam was off too. A moment before he had been holding his
mother's hand, as docile a boy as you could find. She thought
that she had him for the rest of the day. But he was gone before
he knew that he was going. As the white figures flashed like
birds towards the town, he, driven by an impulse entirely
irresistible, was after them. His mother, his amiable placidity,
were lost as though they had never been. Others were running too;
there were shouts and cries, and then suddenly he was aware of a
known voice and there was Farmer Leathwaite, father of Will,
trotting on his black horse beside him.</p>

<p>'Hup! Hup!' Farmer Leathwaite cried, and a moment later had
Adam in his arms, then held tightly in front of him. That was a
glorious ride! Leathwaite had completely lost his Cumbrian
caution. As the horse trotted on, from Leathwaite's big stomach
into the very pit of Adam's back come continual cries,
adjurations, shouts and cheers: 'That's it, Will, my lad! Keep
goin'! Keep goin'! Not so fast through t'town . . . Gently,
gently, my boy. You'll beat 'em! You'll beat lot of 'em . . .
Keep joggin' . . . That's the fancy! Go to it, my lad! Fine lad!
Fine lad! Gently, gently! . . .'</p>

<p>And Adam was caught by the same fever, crying in a cracked
voice: 'Go it, Will! Keep going, Will! Hurray! . . . You're
winning! . . .'</p>

<p>But the gallant horse was also stirred by the splendour of the
event and, do what the farmer would, refused to be stayed, so
before they knew it they had galloped up Main Street, horses and
shops, booths, women, dogs and shouting boys all left behind.</p>

<p>'Woh! Wey! Wey! Woh!' cried Leathwaite, trying to look back
and see how his son was faring, but the mare with her ears
pricked back was racing all the other mares in the world, and
before they knew it they were out of the town and climbing the
hill.</p>

<p>With shouts and curses the horse was at last pulled up. Small
groups were gathered about the path. Leathwaite mopped his brow
with a large yellow handkerchief.</p>

<p>'Do you think Will is going to win?' asked Adam
breathlessly.</p>

<p>'Can't say . . .' Leathwaite panted. 'He's in grand condition
. . . Hope so . . . Hope so . . . They'll be coming shortly . .
.'</p>

<p>It was very quiet here. After the dust, heat, shouts and cries
it was as though a heavy door had closed on the world. The trees
were darkly thick above their heads, the hills like blue clouds
beyond the town.</p>

<p>'How's he doing?' someone called from the waiting group.</p>

<p>'A' reet . . . a' reet,' Leathwaite shouted back.</p>

<p>'I think he'll win, don't you?' Adam said.</p>

<p>Oh, but he <i>had</i> to win! The whole of the world's
happiness depended upon it. Then, after what had seemed an
infinity of time, the white figures appeared, two in front neck
and neck, then three, then at a considerable distance four or
five. They were going more slowly now; the hill was telling on
them, and they had the hardest task yet before them.</p>

<p>The first two were Trimble and a lad called Sawston. Trimble's
big body was almost done. The sweat poured down his face, his
breast was half bare, and on his face there was a set mechanical
smile. But Will was in the next three and running strong . . .
With him were John Graham and Pender. Leathwaite rose on his
horse and waving his arms roared encouragement. Adam shouted
too.</p>

<p>'Go on, Will . . . Go on, Will . . . You'll win! You'll
win!'</p>

<p>He was one with Will then. He and Will were running together.
He was inside Will, knew all his thoughts, his determination, his
measuring of the hill beside him, his calculation of his
strength, knew the maddening irritation of Trimble's great back
in front of him, the temptation to make the spurt before it was
time.</p>

<p>Now the horse went with them, and up the hill Adam and father
and son charged together.</p>

<p>Trimble was giving way. Young Sawston passed him. Graham and
Will drew level with him. Now Graham and Sawston were neck and
neck. Here began the real steepness of the hill. The sun blazed
down, the trees had drawn back as though refusing shelter.</p>

<p>'Now, Will, my lad! Now!' shouted his father.</p>

<p>'NOW, WILL, NOW!' screamed Adam.</p>

<p>Sawston, Graham and Will were together. Graham, his head more
than ever like a hammer, was running well. He was fresh as a
skylark and breasted the hill as though he loved it. Sawston
seemed on a sudden to lose heart; he looked back, missed his
stride. Will passed him. At the hill-top where the path ran level
to the Circle, Graham and Will were ahead.</p>

<p><i>Then,</i> thrust on, it may be, by his father's fierce
energy, Will Leathwaite made his spurt. He was ahead; Graham
caught him. Graham was ahead. Will was level.</p>

<p>The Circle, calm, dignified, gazed indifferently out to
Helvellyn and Scawfell and the Gavel. Will threw up his head; he
seemed to catch all that country into his heart and, fiercely,
like a swimmer fronting a terrific wave, flung himself across the
string, the winner by a head.</p>

<p>Adam tumbled off the horse. Leathwaite, shouting his joy,
caught Adam's small hand and wrung it as though he had never seen
him before.</p>

<br>


<p align="CENTER">THE 'MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM'</p>

<br>


<p>The play was to begin at four o'clock. A platform had been
erected on the rising shoulder of the fields where now St John's
spire raises its finger for the friendly communion of the
clustering hills. Up the slope climbed the meadows, striding to
woods and sky. To the left the town, below them the Lake now
richly dark under this sun with a sheen like the gloss on a
blackberry; on benches raised roughly in four tiers sat the
Quality. Beneath them and on either side of them crowded the
citizens of England, for, although at this very moment of four
o'clock of a fine afternoon in August 1827, all the Keswickians
might be said to have been hovering before landing in a new
world--a world of light, grime, noise, motion and confusion--yet
the decencies were to be observed for a long time yet. Man still
doffed his cap to Master, heads of families <i>were</i> heads of
families, a mile was a mile when you had to walk it, and
amusements were still simple enough and rare enough to be
amusements. The little town, above whose roofs there hung a
violet haze, shared in the happiness of its inhabitants as even
to this day it yet does. From the days when the monks of
Fountains were permitted a mill-dam on the Greta, through the
stages of a weekly market in the thirteenth century over the old
bridge at Portinscale, past the dark slumbering church of
Crosthwaite, from the thirty citizens of Keswick in 1303, it had
had its strong identity and kept it. Spirit and body were from
the first lusty and self-confident. St Herbert saw to the first,
the weekly market saw to the second. Through the wars of Scots
and English, when Threlkeld and Millbeck must be fortified, when
beacons flamed on Skiddaw, through the German invasion in
Elizabeth's time until in middle seventeenth century the last
smelting-house fell into ruin, comforted by the bleating of its
sheep, the lowing of its cattle, resisting the constant rising of
the waters that threatened to overwhelm it, Keswick stayed
compact, pastoral and proud.</p>

<p>Then came Mr Gray riding in his post-chaise, then came the
poets, and the world outside discovered it. Nevertheless, neither
then nor now has that outside world even scratched the lustre of
its peculiar beauty. Now it was not minerals that the invaders
demanded, but scenery, so scenery Keswick would give them. Let
them come and take it, for they could not diminish by a leaf, a
flower or a swollen silver stream the soul of the place itself.
At first wool, then shoes, then pencils, then
Conventions--Keswick with an agreeable smile was generous, and
could afford to be, because its soul was, and must be,
intact.</p>

<p>But it liked best its own affairs, the fun that it had made
itself for its own people, and so today it was especially happy
and its chimneys purred with pleasure. There was an air of casual
enjoyment about everything, and most especially about the play of
Mr Shakespeare's. You would not perhaps have recognized it for Mr
Shakespeare's play if you had seen it, for that was the time when
actors did what they pleased to the plays that had the honour to
offer them performances, and to none more than to Mr
Shakespeare's.</p>

<p>These Players were here entirely by chance. They had been in
the town from Penrith for several days, so that Mr William
Greene--the chief of them--a gentleman as round as Falstaff and
as jolly too, was by now almost a friend, and there was his wife,
Mrs Greene, a tall lady with a deep bass voice, and his daughter
Isabella, but these were known as friends always ready for a
drink and none too certain about the paying for their
charges.</p>

<p>Rain would have ruined everything, but rain for once was far,
far away. It seemed, as you looked out across the purple Lake to
that stainless sky, that it would never rain again.</p>

<p>The Quality, sitting most contently on the hard boards (for
the Quality was easily pleased if there was any kind of fun
toward), shared in the general cheer. Among the Keswickians there
was considerable anxiety (although a happy anxiety), for a number
of the Keswick children had been called in to be fairies, and no
one knew how they would behave or what they would do--the
children least of all--for there had been but one rehearsal, when
the confusion had been so great that the final orders simply were
'to keep their eye on Titania and Oberon and follow them
around'.</p>

<p>While they waited, the superior people held distinguished
conversation together. There was not a great deal of room. Walter
was pressed against James Herries, and his stout knees pushed
into the thin backs of Misses Mary and Grace Pendexter, two
maiden ladies who were ready to enjoy anything at any time and at
any sacrifice. Evening after evening they would be out in their
pattens, their old servant lighting them with a lantern, to play
cards with Miss Pennyfeather or Major Bellenden, and now to have
the handsome knees of the master of Westaways pressing their
bones was a joy indeed. It happened, so close were they all
together, that Westaways and Fell House were at last neighbours.
It was as though the whole day had been working for this end,
and, indeed, important consequences were to come of it. For John
was near to Elizabeth Herries. When he saw how close he was to
her, none of his customary shyness or caution could restrain him.
In her primrose gown, sitting beside her mother, not speaking but
her lips a little parted at her enjoyment of the scene, she
seemed to him like a lovely bird from some Paradisal forest. It
was arranged for him by some especial destiny that he should be
near her. He knew that her mother, Mrs Herries, was a gentle lady
who would wish him no harm. Her father, laughing and slapping his
knee, was at a distance. Only one thing prevented him--Uhland,
her brother, who sat staring in front of him, his brow wrinkled,
his eyes like little stones, one knee--as always--crooked over
the other. As always, John was affected by a sort of cold nausea
at his proximity, but today this new emotion of joy and
happiness, as though like a great explorer, from the deck of his
ship, over the trackless waste, he had seen the gold sands
gleaming, was too strong for him to be checked.</p>

<p>If he moved a little from where he was sitting he would almost
touch her. He rose up, stood back as though not to prevent the
others' view, then raising his hat said:</p>

<p>'Good afternoon, Mrs Herries.'</p>

<p>She must have been greatly astonished that he should speak to
her, but she, poor lady, bore no animosity to anyone in the world
and was delighted at kindliness, so she smiled timidly and
said:</p>

<p>'Good afternoon.' ('What a splendidly handsome boy,' she
thought.)</p>

<p>John's eyes (he could not help himself) were fastened on
Elizabeth, but he said:</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am. We are fortunate in the weather.'</p>

<p>'It is indeed a splendid day,' Mrs Herries replied to him.</p>

<p>Then, boldly, he spoke to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>'I trust you can see well where you are sitting,' he said.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and to her also he appeared as something
new and wonderful. He was standing in the sunlight, very erect
and tall, the sun shining on his hair. She wondered why she had
never noticed before how beautiful he was. Although she was
frightened of her father and had been forced all her life into
the background, she was not nervous. She smiled.</p>

<p>'I can see most excellently, thank you.'</p>

<p>At her smile he could have gone on his knees and worshipped
her.</p>

<p>'You will tell me if I am in your view,' he said, bowing.
Then, just as he was moving away, he realized that two eyes were
looking at him with a malignant force that seemed impossible for
so small a boy. Elizabeth's brother's . . . Something cold struck
his heart.</p>

<p>The play had begun. From the first it was invalidated by the
fact that Mr Greene, who was playing Bottom, wished to be in the
forefront throughout, and that his wife, who was Titania, had the
same desire.</p>

<p>So Theseus and his Court were soon bustled off the scene and
the pairs of lovers were permitted to love and bicker only in
brief moments while Bottom found his breath. Titania (very fine
in shining ermine with a helmet--a perfect conception of
Britannia) was meanwhile hovering with her attendant elves
('There's Lucy,' cried Mrs Bucket, 'her with the daisies.'
'That's our Liz--standing on one foot,' cried Mrs Ellis) near the
platform and suddenly pushed forward and began, in her deep
voice, to shout her lines.</p>

<p>'First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on,'
shouted Mr Greene.</p>

<p>'What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence. I have forsworn
his bed and company,' cried Mrs Greene.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed that there would be trouble, but Bottom
had his way, and Titania retired to sit on the grass near by and
throw daisies at the children, for in spite of her size and voice
she was a merry and kindly woman.</p>

<p>When, however, the time for the fairies was really come, they
had their triumph. For one thing Oberon was a splendid young man,
with a handsome red cloak and a noble pair of legs. Then the
children, loving the sunshine and the freedom, exalted by the
presence of parents and relations, behaved as fairies should,
dancing everywhere, joining hands and singing, tumbling head over
heels, running races, plucking at Oberon's cloak. The gaiety that
had been in the air all day possessed the company and the
audience together.</p>

<p>When Bottom became an ass and laid his great form on Titania's
big lap everyone roared with applause, and the fairies pinched
his legs, and Titania took off her helmet because it was so hot.
There were fairies everywhere. When Theseus and his Court
returned the sun was lower in the sky and long shadows lay across
the grass. Some of the fairies, tired out, were sleeping, but
behind Bottom and his companions, as they played their Play, the
children danced and sang, Titania, carrying a baby in her arms,
walked with half a dozen infants at her skirts (she had by now
flung away most of her armour), and Bottom and Peter Quince,
Theseus and Helena romped to the fiddle of an old man of the
company who worked at his music in an ecstasy of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Puck came forward to speak his Epilogue and a sudden silence
fell:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we shadows have offended,<br>
 Think but this (and all is mended)<br>
 That you have but slumber'd here<br>
 While these visions did appear.<br>
 And this weak and idle theme,<br>
 No more yielding but a dream . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>The cheers and shouts echoed from Main Street to Cat Bells.
The gipsies under the wood heard it; an old man, driving his cart
home to Watendlath, heard it and in a piping voice began to sing
. . .</p>

<br>


<p align="CENTER">THE DANCING ON THE MEADOW</p>

<br>


<p>The moon rose, triumphantly full, made of light and crystal,
lucent in a sky fiery with stars. The evening was so warm that
everyone brought food in baskets, in napkins and bags, and sat
about on the meadow waiting for the Town Band.</p>

<p>Judith, Jennifer and the children had planned to stay and see
the dancing and the fireworks, but now Jennifer wished to go
home. They had all been resting at Miss Pennyfeather's and had
started towards the Lake to see the fireworks when Jennifer
caught Judith's arm.</p>

<p>'I think I will go home, Judith.'</p>

<p>They were standing under the trees. Adam, John and Dorothy had
gone on to the margin of the Lake that they might watch the
trembling path of the moon on the water, and the boats like dark
fragments of cloud that floated into the light and out again.</p>

<p>'But why, Jennifer?' Judith asked. 'Are you unwell?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Jennifer. 'I have a foreboding.'</p>

<p>'A foreboding? Of what?'</p>

<p>'I cannot say . . . Perhaps it is being so near to that wicked
man all day--the murderer of my husband.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Jennifer. You must not have these fancies, you must
not. Come. The fireworks will shortly commence.'</p>

<p>'No. I prefer to go home.'</p>

<p>'But we cannot find Bennett . . . And I have no notion where
Mr Rackstraw has gone. Jennifer, dear . . . Here is a seat. Rest
here for a moment.'</p>

<p>The two women sat down together. Judith took Jennifer's hand,
but the gaiety and happiness that had accompanied her all day
were gone. Once (what years ago it seemed!) in Paris she had been
with her friend Emma Furze, watching the dancing, and suddenly,
without warning, Warren Forster, the father of Adam, who was
shortly then to be born, appeared in front of her. She remembered
now the sharp sense that she had had of Fate stepping up through
the dark trees beside her. She had the same sense now.</p>

<p>'What is it, Jennifer? . . . It has been a most beautiful day.
Everyone has been happy.'</p>

<p>'I cannot help it, Judith. I am growing an old woman now, but
whenever I see that man I am afraid. He has been close to me all
day--and the nearer he comes to me the greater terror I feel. And
I am sure that one day he will build a house in Uldale and he
will look into our windows. He will kill me; yes, he will kill me
just as he murdered Francis. And then he will kill John and
Dorothy.'</p>

<p>Judith started. Could Jennifer know of Walter's threat to
build on High Ireby? She herself had never spoken of it, but
someone else might have done. Walter had held his hand now for a
long while; of late he had let them be except that there was a
story of John's that he had looked out of window one night and
seen Walter on his horse, motionless, staring at the house. But
that may have been dream or fantasy. John had all the imagination
of his father.</p>

<p>'No, no, Jennifer . . . Listen--you must not think about
Walter. He has forgotten us. He has not been near us for years.
Really he has not. And I am looking after you. While I am there
no harm can come to you.'</p>

<p>Judith felt as though she had a large overgrown child beside
her. Jennifer was as usual untidy, her turban was a little askew.
Her fine dress of white muslin that went wonderfully with her
dark hair trailed at the skirt: her cashmere shawl was torn in
one place. Through how many differing stages of relation she had
been with Jennifer, Judith thought! From that first vision of her
at Christabel's Ball in their youth when Jennifer, in her Medici
dress, had been the loveliest creature in the world, through
jealousy and anger, almost to hatred (she recalled vividly still
that day at tea at Mrs Southey's), to this complete, kindly, but
a little scornful domination!</p>

<p>'Come, Jennifer . . . Do not go home . . . It will make the
children unhappy. They are having such a wonderful day. There
will be the fireworks and then the dancing. It is so warm a
night!'</p>

<p>Jennifer laid a trembling hand on Judith's.</p>

<p>'Judith, I know something dreadful will occur.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense. Nonsense . . . Now this truly is nonsense. We must
not spoil the children's amusement.' ('And my own amusement as
well,' thought Judith. 'I have never enjoyed a day so much.')</p>

<p>But she had made this one appeal to Jennifer that must be
successful. Selfish, apprehensive, sluggish though she was, she
wished the children to be happy, and especially John, whom she
adored.</p>

<p>So they went, arm-in-arm, to the Lakeside.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The fireworks were a great success, and when they had watched
them they walked slowly up the hill to the meadow. Adam went with
Judith. They were of a size now. Adam was as tall as his
mother.</p>

<p>'Are you happy, Adam?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mama.' He gave her arm a little squeeze. 'I <i>am</i>
glad Will won the race.'</p>

<p>'Yes, so am I--but you should have told me that you were going
. . . I had no notion where you were.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mama . . . Can we go and see the gipsies?'</p>

<p>'Yes, if you stay beside me.'</p>

<p>When they came to the field the theatre was cleared away, and
where the audience had sat the Town Band was. The great moon
shone down on them all like a kindly benevolent hostess who had
arranged the festivity and saw that it was good.</p>

<p>Young John had but one thought. His eyes roamed the scene. But
poor John! He moved as we move in a nightmare seeking some person
or place, but baffled at every moment by figures, mists and
sudden catastrophes. The moonlight was now bright enough, the
space wide enough for an army of young lovers, but fate played
with him, catching him now here, now there, as though it were
warning him that it would be better for him to ride home, find
his bed and hide there. First he encountered one of the Miss
Pendexters, who at once drew him into a babble of chatter: '. . .
Well, now, that's a true saying about an ill wind, for only a
moment ago I was asking your mother how you were finding it all.
"John's enjoying himself, you may be sure," I said to her, "for
this is just a night . . ." Oh, there's Major Bellenden. I was
going to ask him . . . and a perfect little house my sister and I
have moved into. We insist that you come to see us. Perfect
situation, near the road so that there's always something
passing, and dear Crosthwaite Church only half a mile . . . Yes,
I was telling your mother--how lovely she is in the white muslin,
to be sure--I was telling your mother that it will be no trouble
of an evening to find our way to Miss Pennyfeather's for a game,
for on a dark night Maria with a lantern is all we need, and
often enough we can make up a table for ourselves. For our
friends are so obliging--so very good . . .'</p>

<p>Escaping from this he ran into a confusion of happy life. So
dry was the night that everyone sat on the grass, watching the
dancing and exchanging all the gossip. The town, the countryside,
all was represented. The music of the band came gently through
the air.</p>

<p>And more turbulent every moment was the evening becoming, for
there were rough fellows from Cockermouth and Whitehaven, there
were the gipsies, and bottles were passing from hand to hand. The
dancing was growing wilder. Stout wives picked up their skirts
and romped. Old grandfathers with a 'tee-hee-hee' pinched the
arms of young girls, babies cried, dogs barked, but the woods
made a dark frontier, the sky a star-fretted canopy, the
mountains kept guard.</p>

<p>Through this whirling, noisy scene John found his way, looking
into every face, thinking that maybe her mother had taken her
home, praying that that might not be.</p>

<p>Then, mounting the hill towards the gipsy encampment, he saw
the whole party. They had found some trestle seats--Walter, James
and the young men were exceedingly gay; Mrs Walter Herries and
Elizabeth were a little apart, quietly watching. John waited,
taking in with all his soul Elizabeth as she stood, a dark cloak
now over her shoulders; the rest of the world, the dancers, the
lighted fires, the stars that sparkled above the heavy wood,
vanished. She was alone and in her silence and quiet, a saint in
a chapel secret and remote for his own single worship. He stayed
there a long while. In his twenty years he had known no feeling
like this, nothing that made him both so proud and so humble, so
resolute and so brave, but so timid also with a shy
foreboding.</p>

<p>She was a child, eight years younger than himself; she was the
daughter of his greatest enemy. He was conscious then of Walter,
who was being very merry and noisy, so that you could hear his
laughter above all the rest. He was aware too of Uhland, who sat
like a little ghost beside his father.</p>

<p>Without knowing it, he had moved nearer and then nearer again.
On any other occasion nothing could have compelled him to
approach those figures who stood to him for everything in life
that he hated and feared the most.</p>

<p>He had come up behind them, and then, as though she had known,
Elizabeth turned round to look at the downward slope of the hill
and the light on the water. They were all absorbed in the
dancing, and the two, as though in a trance, came together.</p>

<p>They had exchanged only two sentences of convention in all
their lives, but it seemed to her quite natural that he should
say, looking at her but coming no closer:</p>

<p>'I have been searching for you everywhere.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said with a little cry of warning, looking back.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know . . . But I must see you again. I must, I
must.'</p>

<p>'One day--yes . . . I would like it--'</p>

<p>'Where?' He came nearer until he almost touched her.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'We must not--'</p>

<p>'Listen,' he said quickly. 'I will write. Our coachman will
find a way to give it you--'</p>

<p>She stared at him as though she must see him so intensely that
she would remember afterwards all his features. She nodded as
though they had made a compact, then slowly she turned back.</p>

<p>No one can say what he would have done then, of what madness
he might not have been capable, had he not seen, with a dismay
that thrust him in an instant from one world into another, his
mother, Judith and Dorothy approaching.</p>

<p>To his horror he saw that they, quite unconsciously, were
walking directly into the Westaways group. He would have thought
that for some mad reason they were doing this deliberately, had
it not been that they were so plainly unaware. For Judith was
laughing, pointing with her stick to some dancers, and Dorothy
was teasing Adam as though she were trying to make him dance. He
did dance a few steps, looking in the moonlight like a little
animal, with his long arms and short body. They all laughed. John
heard Judith say: 'Here is a fine place. We can see well from
here.' He would have started forward to warn them, but it was too
late.</p>

<p>In another moment Judith had almost stumbled on the bench
where Walter was sitting.</p>

<p>John came forward as though to protect his mother. Walter
Herries stood up. It was plain that he had been drinking heavily,
for he lurched a little on his great legs as he stood.</p>

<p>Jennifer was transfixed with terror. In all the years since
her husband's death she had never until now been face to face
with him.</p>

<p>Walter took off his hat.</p>

<p>'Good evening, ladies! How agreeable a surprise! Not
unexpected too. Will you not join us?'</p>

<p>Jennifer caught at Judith's arm.</p>

<p>'Oh, come, Judith. Come away!'</p>

<p>But Walter was delighted. Such scenes he fancied. The young
Durward Herries boys, who saw something strange was abroad,
stared, their laughter checked.</p>

<p>'Well, Jennifer,' Walter said. 'It is a long time since we
met. It was my mother you knew, I think. I hope that you cherish
no ill-will, though, for I assure you that I do not.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Walter,' Judith broke in. 'This is too public for
your wit. Jennifer, we will turn back--'</p>

<p>But he strode forward so that he almost touched Jennifer's
arm. He made no sign that anyone existed for him but Jennifer,
who shrank back against Judith.</p>

<p>'No, no. Why so unfriendly? We must be friends, we must
indeed. For we are to be neighbours. Very near neighbours indeed.
You didn't know? But, of course . . . At High Ireby. I am to
start building in a month or so.'</p>

<p>'You cannot--' Jennifer answered. That would be terrible. I
could not--'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' said Walter. He took a step nearer. Then John,
seized with a wild fury, struck him in the chest. Walter
tottered, for he was not at all steady, almost fell. There were
cries, exclamations. Little Uhland had rushed forward, hitting at
John's legs.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, a most ludicrous, lamentable scene, for the
other young Herries men, themselves rather drunk, came forward
(not very aware of what they would do). Judith lifted her stick,
Agnes Herries caught Walter's arm . . .</p>

<p>Then in a moment the publicity of it hit them all. They stood
transfixed in a frozen group. Two gipsies approached and one of
them, a young woman with an orange kerchief and a cage of little
green birds said: 'Lady . . . Pretty lady . . . The birds will
tell your fortune . . . Happy luck, lady.'</p>

<p>Walter steadied himself.</p>

<p>'Here,' he said, 'you can tell my fortune, my girl, and give
me a fine one.'</p>

<p>With great dignity, very slowly, Judith and Jennifer, their
children following them, turned down the hill.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c105">THE BEGINNING OF THE FORTRESS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Walter Herries had told Jennifer that the building of his
house on High Ireby was at once to begin. It was not, however,
until the month of March 1830 that the foundations were first
laid--and it happened that Jennifer was there to see.</p>

<p>Jennifer never recovered from that shock of the encounter with
Walter on the night of the Summer Fair. It was the climax to a
series of events that stretched back to that old Ball of her
youth, and possibly, behind that again, to her earliest nursery
escape from reality. She did not know now--she had not an
analytic mind--what had happened to her or indeed why anything
had ever happened to her at all. She was an old woman--this year
saw her sixtieth birthday--but for all her years she felt herself
to be still a young girl most unjustly treated by everyone.</p>

<p>In the early days--they seemed to her to be as recent as last
evening--she had never had justice. Her beauty had brought her
nothing: everything had been always just awry. She would have
been the Duchess of Wrexe and a great woman of the world had not
the Duke been so unpleasant a young man and the position of great
lady so tedious and wearisome. She would have been a quiet beauty
in the country had not Francis, her husband, been a weakling. She
would have been a splendid Mistress had not her lover been a
clod. She would have been a triumphant Mother had her children
loved her. She would be now mistress of her house had not Judith
taken selfishly everything out of her hands. Always injustice,
everywhere injustice. No one saw what she was and no one
cared.</p>

<p>The sluggish slackness in her that had ruined her life she did
not perceive, for we never catch the causes of our fate, so clear
to everyone around us. She might even now have been a fine tragic
figure had she had the intelligence to look noble, the energy to
tidy her hair, the wisdom to have reticence.</p>

<p>She had never had dignity or wisdom; she had been always the
slave of trifles, small jealousies, degrading idleness, lazy
avoidances of trouble.</p>

<p>But the terror of Walter struck into her character as a snake
strikes. She was poisoned in all her being. The infection spread
slowly, but from the moment that Judith consented to stay and
took the house into her hands, Jennifer was lost. She had now
nothing to do but brood over Walter. She cowered beneath his
shadow, unable to move, waiting the awful moment.</p>

<p>As his shadow grew ever more terrible the figures immediately
around her became themselves shadows. John had once been her
darling, Judith's Adam a pleasure, the servants agreeable, her
daughter Dorothy 'a good girl', Judith herself, although a
tyrant, exceedingly useful and a safeguard.</p>

<p>After her scene with Walter all these were as unsubstantial to
her as figures on a tapestry. She might have been still a fine
woman; she had yet all her height, her hair (once so lovely) was
white with, if she had cared, a fine lustre in its silver. But
she was untidy, careless, a slattern. Any old clothes did for
her, her hair escaped its pins, she would tap-tap in loose
slippers, an old shawl over her shoulders, from room to room.
Only her eyes were good, and the blaze in them, their intensity,
belied all the rest of her, so that they were like a bright fire
in a lumber-room. She would begin sentences and not finish them,
eat food greedily and suddenly abandon it, pet John and Adam
eagerly and then look at them as though she did not know them.
The servants disregarded her; they took their orders from
Madame.</p>

<p>Judith knew that terror was of an especial danger to anyone of
even part Herries blood. She had seen, in all her active varied
life, that the history of the Herries, as of so many British
families, was that of a building impregnable, as its builders
thought, to the attacks of all outside forces. But the outside
forces are strong and immortal. Nothing tempts their malicious
humour so thoroughly as the complacency of the builders. Here
they twist a chimney, there a window rattles, now the wind sweeps
wildly up the ordered garden, the iron-sheathed door shudders, a
picture falls, the carpet rises on the floor.</p>

<p>Jennifer's parents had been typical Herries, good, complacent,
satisfied, laughing at imagination. Jennifer, so lovely, their
pride, their joy, must be safe if any Herries was. Who would dare
to touch her? So, in their love for her, they took from her all
her defences. Now, when a vision of another world more real than
the Herries one might have saved her, she had no vision. And
Judith could not help her.</p>

<p>From the moment of Walter's threat, for two years and a half,
she waited. But life does not allow you to wait. No one knew what
the matter with her was and, more tragically, no one cared. Her
children had loved her, but Dorothy was all for comfort and found
her uncomfortable, while John, after he knew of the reasons for
his father's suicide, shrank, against all his will and wish, from
contact. Moreover, he had now something so absorbing in his life
that his mother was dim to him, as he was to her.</p>

<p>Judith could have loved her because she pitied her and pity,
with Judith, was maternal; but daily contact with Jennifer's
laziness, carelessness, selfishness, turned pity into impatience,
and when Judith was impatient she was at her worst.</p>

<p>So Jennifer was alone with her terror.</p>

<p>As the time advanced, that terror took strange forms. High
Ireby became a place of extraordinary fascination for her. It was
several miles from Uldale and uphill for most of the way, but day
after day she walked through the fields, climbed the slope and
then stood, under the trees, gazing at the lovely scene--the
walls of a ruined cottage, a small wood of whispering trees,
remnants of a garden patch, and the long slope of the melancholy
fields with the village and house of Uldale tucked into the
hollow.</p>

<p>To the right were the sprawling slopes of Blencathra and
Skiddaw. They lay against the sky like the careless limbs of a
giant sleeper under an enormous coverlet tossed into casual
shapes. She knew here all weathers, all seasons. She would stand
against the ruined wall, under the trees, a tall, motionless old
woman in a tawdry hat, clutching her shawl, staring in front of
her. She became a familiar figure to the inhabitants of the
village near by. It was not strange that she should soon have a
reputation for madness, but she was not mad in the least. She
would stand there, or sit on a tumbled stone, and reflect, in a
lazy way, on her misfortune--not on any very definite misfortune
but on the general way in which she was ill-treated and
neglected. Sometimes she would determine that on her return to
Uldale that day she would tell them all what she thought of
them--Judith, John, Dorothy, even Mr Rackstraw--but she never
did. Partly it was too much trouble, partly when she was once
again in the comfortable parlour at Uldale drinking tea before
the fire or, in the summer, sitting under the tree on the lawn in
the sunshine, she was cosy like a cat and smiled, lazily, on
everyone.</p>

<p>She had too, all this time, marvellous health. Nothing ailed
her.</p>

<p>She had perhaps the idea, as she stood in the little wood, day
after day, that thus she was defying Walter. During all these two
years she never saw him in the flesh. He became the more
monstrous because she did not see him.</p>

<p>Then one day at last the thing happened. That March there was
a late fall of snow. During the first week of that month a
blizzard blew across the North, adding discomfort to all the
hardships that the poor people were, at that time, already
suffering. Waters were frozen, the sun, when it broke through,
turned the snow-ridges into shining marble, the crows were spots
of ink on the virgin fields.</p>

<p>She had had a cold for a week, and Judith had kept her in bed,
but as soon as she was up she strode across the fields again, her
shawl flapping behind her, climbed the hill and walked into a
multitude of men.</p>

<p>Trees were falling. It seemed that on every side of her the
trees were tumbling. The walls of the ruined cottage were no
more. Men walked measuring the ground. A fire was lit on the snow
and illuminated the broken whiteness of the scene that stretched
back into the farther shadows of the wood.</p>

<p>As she stood back in the road hidden by two huge horses from
whose nostrils steam struck the air, a tree fell with a great
crash and a groan that seemed to come from her own heart. Men
shouted joyfully, and some boys, muffled against the cold, danced
round the fire.</p>

<p>She stepped into the middle of the road and several of them
saw her. Two gentlemen on horseback, attended by little Peach,
Walter's agent, were watching the proceedings: one of them was
the architect, Mr Humphrey Carstairs from London, the other,
young Julius Hopper, a clever lad working in old Mr Bonner's
office in Keswick. Old Mr Bonner was the oldest, stupidest and
laziest architect in the North of England, and no one despised
him quite so deeply as did young Julius. Young Julius was slim
and dark and exceedingly handsome in his high-collared dark green
overcoat; Carstairs was squat, thick, his head almost hidden in
the curves of his plum-coloured capes. He bent low in his saddle;
he suffered severely from rheumatism.</p>

<p>He turned and saw the strange woman in the old-fashioned hat,
drawn to her full height in the middle of the snowy road. He
stared, then turned to young Julius. 'Who's the old body in the
shawl?' he asked.</p>

<p>Young Julius stared also. He knew who she was: his first
thought was that this would be amusing for Walter Herries if he
rode over that afternoon. His second was of alarm. She looked
crazy; he knew, of course, of the feud. She might have a pistol
under that shawl of hers. He was a warm young man, fond of life,
very ambitious. He had no desire to die as yet. Another tree
fell; men were dragging branches across the snow that blew in
little smoky spirals of silver into the air. The flames of the
fire leaped, and an old man sitting by it, with a great red
comforter round his neck and yellow mittens, began to play on a
fiddle. The mittens made his fingers clumsy, but the men liked
the music and worked with a better will.</p>

<p>'She's a Mrs Herries from Uldale yonder,' young Julius
whispered. 'She's a sort of cousin of Walter Herries.' Then he
added: 'I'll go speak to her.'</p>

<p>With what he felt to be exceptional bravery (for it was
possible enough that she concealed a pistol) he dragged his
horse's head round and rode towards her. She never moved, but
stood there in the road, staring at the men, the fallen trees,
the old man in the bright red comforter. Young Julius raised his
hat.</p>

<p>'Good afternoon, Mrs Herries.' Then he said, smiling: 'Very
wintry for March, ma'am.'</p>

<p>He wasn't sure that she saw him. He moved his horse a little
to the right.</p>

<p>Then she said: 'What is going on here?'</p>

<p>He was able now to see her eyes, the pallor of her face,
something dignified in her isolation. He spoke with the greatest
politeness as he answered:</p>

<p>'Why, ma'am, Mr Walter Herries of Westaways is to build a
house here.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?' She nodded her head. 'A house of some size?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes. It is to be a very fine place indeed--gardens and a
fountain, magnificent stables. A lonely spot, though, to have
chosen. Mr Carstairs there from London is the architect.'</p>

<p>'What is your name?'</p>

<p>She looked at him directly and there was something in her eyes
that touched him very truly.</p>

<p>'My name, ma'am, is Hopper--Julius Hopper. I am assistant to
Mr Bonner, the architect in Keswick. I know your son, Jack
Herries, well. We are very good friends.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, my son.' Her eyes went back to the fire that seemed
to have a great fascination for her. The thin, reedy, uncertain
squeak of the fiddle came whining through the sharp air.</p>

<p>'And how long will it be in the building?'</p>

<p>'A considerable while, ma'am. Mr Herries wishes everything to
be of the best . . .'</p>

<p>'Ah . . . He wishes everything to be of the best . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am. And these are not easy times. Although so many
are without employment, it is not easy to get good workmen and
wages are high. As soon as we have Reform things will be
better.'</p>

<p>'You believe in Reform?'</p>

<p>'I do indeed, ma'am. We shall have Revolution else, like the
French.'</p>

<p>'You are wrong.' She spoke with slow consideration, as though
she beat every word upon the ground. 'Reform itself is
Revolution. The country will be ruined. The country is in any
case ruined.'</p>

<p>'I hope not indeed.'</p>

<p>'Ah, you are young . . .'</p>

<p>She moved away from him up the road. His horse stepped beside
her. He would never forget that odd, tall, black figure with the
crazy hat, moving against the snow. He thought after that it had
been a kind of omen, but he was a sane practical young man who
did not believe in omens, although out of habit he avoided
walking under a ladder.</p>

<p>She came so far and then saw Peach. Mr Carstairs had come down
from his horse and now he and Peach were studying a plan.
Jennifer scarcely knew Peach, and yet his short bow-legged figure
was in some way familiar to her. She looked up at Julius, and he,
not knowing what to say, remarked:</p>

<p>'The snowdrops are doing bravely in spite of the snow.' There
was a great patch of them under the trees. Some of them were
already trodden down and, as he looked, two men, carrying a log,
tramped upon the patch.</p>

<p>'Oh, the snowdrops!' She put her hand on his knee, leaning up
to him. 'Tell Walter Herries what he is destroying.'</p>

<p>She turned and walked swiftly down the road, catching her
shawl more closely about her. The three men turned to watch
her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Meanwhile at Uldale, as it happened on that same afternoon,
Judith assisted by Dorothy Herries was entertaining four lady
callers--old Miss Pennyfeather, Mrs Leyland of The Ridge,
Bassenthwaite, and her two daughters Nancy and Bella.</p>

<p>Miss Pennyfeather had been driven over by Judith, who had been
taking luncheon with her in Keswick; the Leylands had come over
from Bassenthwaite in their barouche. All the ladies were very
pleasantly animated: the three elders, their heads together, near
the fire, and the girls laughing and chattering by the
window.</p>

<p>For the Leyland girls this was an adventure. Dorothy Herries,
blooming with health and good temper, was two years older than
Nancy and Bella, who were twins and were wanting to be married,
for they were already twenty years of age and soon it would be
too late. They were nice simple girls who had never been to
London and only visited the theatre in Newcastle and were eager
for gossip and adventure. They were pale, flaxen, tall and slim,
and dressed alike. They wore dresses of poplin, colour violette
de Parme, with heart-shaped bodices, and the corsages long and
tight at the waist. They had hats of rice straw with very wide
brims, trimmed with anemones. Each thought the other looked
bewitching, for they were generous and warm-hearted by
nature.</p>

<p>They had never been to Uldale before on a visit, and this was
a great adventure. 'Madame' was a 'character' through the whole
countryside, and it was wonderful to be entertained in her
parlour. Or was it Mrs Herries' parlour? People said that she was
mad and walked about the country singing songs to herself--mad,
poor thing, because her husband had discovered her with her lover
and he had killed himself. Very shocking, but <i>how</i>
romantic! And then her son John was so handsome, the best-looking
young man in the North, a little sad and pensive as a
good-looking young man ought to be. (For they adored <i>Thaddeus
of Warsaw</i> and Mrs Cuthbertson's <i>Santo Sebastiano</i> and
Mrs Meeke's <i>Midnight Weddings</i>.) Dorothy on the other
hand--whom they loved at sight--was not melancholy at all and
laughed all the while.</p>

<p>Then there was 'Madame's' boy whom they did hope they'd get a
sight of. He was, of course, illegitimate, which made him so
interesting, although everyone knew who the father had been. He
<i>should</i> have been romantic and melancholy, but people said
that he was ugly and silent and kept to himself. Nevertheless, it
would be <i>adorable</i> to see him!</p>

<p>While they laughed and chattered by the window they tried to
keep an ear open for the company by the fire. For Miss
Pennyfeather did say such <i>shocking</i> things and their mother
(Mrs Leyland was stout and jolly) had told them that on no
account were they to listen to Miss Pennyfeather's wickedness, so
they were naturally all ears.</p>

<p>But the ladies seemed to be talking of nothing but Reform,
Lord John Russell, and of Brougham's attack on Lady Jersey in
<i>The Times,</i> and how bitter she was against Reform, and so
on, and so on--dull stuff!</p>

<p>Then Dorothy let it out that next month 'Madame' and her son
were to go to London to stay with some relations. <i>That</i> was
exciting! To go to London! To see the great Simpson at Vauxhall,
to visit the New Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park, to attend a
Masquerade in the Argyll Rooms, to catch a glimpse of the Duke,
and best of all the Theatre, the Surrey, the Royalty, or Sadler's
Wells.</p>

<p>They knew all about it; it was as though they had been in
London all their lives. They looked across to the fire and that
little upright dominating woman in her crimson dress with the
huge sleeves; they stared (as unobtrusively as politeness
insisted) at her small pale face, her neat grey hair, her ivory
cane, and watched her bright eyes, her smile, the tapping of her
small foot on the carpet. People said that she was the daughter
of a gipsy and that her father, although of the finest family,
had been a rogue and vagabond. And here she was, with her
illegitimate boy, behaving as though she were Queen of England.
Ah! <i>What</i> a romantic afternoon they were having!</p>

<p>It was made yet more splendid by the entrance of John Herries.
Both girls, at sight of him, had the same thought. What a
<i>lover</i> he would make! But there was something that told
them at once that he was not for them. He came over to them and
made himself very charming. His voice was soft and gentle. Yes,
he <i>was</i> melancholy, although he teased his sister and
chaffed them about their beaux at a recent Ball in Keswick. But
they felt that his mind was elsewhere.</p>

<p>What a <i>hero</i> of a novel he would make! He was too gentle
to be truly Byronic, but he would suit <i>The False Step</i>
exactly! How beautifully he went and paid his devoir to their
mother, with what ease! And yet he was in no way effeminate,
quite unlike that horrid William d'Arcy of Threlkeld, or, on the
other hand, that oaf, young Osmaston.</p>

<p>Well, it was time for them to be going. Darkness would soon
swallow the pale saffron twilight. Already the candles were lit
in the room. Mrs Leyland rose to make her adieux when the door
opened and the strangest figure stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>Jennifer stood there, her hat a little askew, her long thin
fingers clutching her shawl. She could see but indistinctly. The
candlelight blinded her, coming in as she did from the dark
snow-shine road. But she saw Judith.</p>

<p>'Judith! Judith! He has begun to build!'</p>

<p>The cry, shrill, poignant, broke the comfortable cosiness of
the room into fragments. Jennifer had awaked at last.</p>

<p>'Judith! They are trampling on the snowdrops . . . The trees
are falling!'</p>

<p>She stumbled forward, her hat ever more askew as she moved,
and Judith, coming to her, caught her hand.</p>

<p>'Wait, Jennifer. There are guests here . . .'</p>

<p>Mrs Leyland, good and kind woman as she was, did the right
thing. She chattered:</p>

<p>'Well, I'm sure . . . How do you do, Mrs Herries? A cold
afternoon to be out in. You must be weary, and a cup of tea will
be the very thing. And now we must be going. So very dark,
although William is a most careful driver. We brought him from
Newcastle with us. He was always careful from a boy. Might
William be summoned, Mrs Herries? Thank you. Most kind. Come,
girls. William will have the horses in an instant. He is always
so prompt. It has been truly most delightful. I'm sure . . .'</p>

<p>But Jennifer was not to be silenced by any chatter. She saw
only one thing, one terrible thing, before her eyes--and she must
declare it. Judith had seated her on the sofa, had pulled the
bell-rope, was pouring a cup of hot tea. Dorothy had come round
to her mother. The girls stood in the window, not knowing quite
what they should do but enthralled by what they saw and heard.
John had gone to hasten Mrs Leyland's horses.</p>

<p>'Yes, he has begun at last, Judith. All his men are there,
measuring the ground, and it is to be a huge place with a
fountain and fine stabling. All the trees are falling, and they
have lit a fire in the snow.'</p>

<p>'It is Walter Herries,' Judith explained <i>sotto voce.</i>
'He has been threatening for a long while that he would build on
High Ireby that he may overlook us--and now it seems that he has
done it.'</p>

<p>'Well,' cried old Miss Pennyfeather. 'Let him, and much good
may it do him! I cannot endure Walter and I don't care who hears
me. Fat overgrown bully! Let him build with his limping child and
puny wife! Don't you worry, Judith. 'Tis all stuff and nonsense!
He can't harm you and he knows it!'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' said Mrs Leyland, gazing anxiously at the door
for news of her horses. 'I should think so indeed. So he's to be
our neighbour at Ireby, is he? A pretty neighbour, and so Mr
Leyland will prove to him if he comes bothering our way. Come,
girls--William must have brought the horses round.'</p>

<p>But Jennifer looked at them all with startled, staring
eyes.</p>

<p>'He will not be content until he has destroyed us. I knew it
from the first. All his windows will look down on us. We must
leave Uldale. I always said that he would have his way!'</p>

<p>Judith was sitting beside her. She had one of her hands in
hers.</p>

<p>'Jennifer, Jennifer . . . You must not be so distressed.
Cousin Walter will do us no harm. How can he? What if he does
build a house at Ireby? That can do us no harm. Come, come,
Jennifer . . .'</p>

<p>How soft and gentle her voice was, thought the girls, and how
crazy Mrs Herries looked, poor woman, with her hat on one
side!</p>

<p>Mrs Leyland beamed comfortably on them. 'I am sure Ireby is no
place for a house, no place at all. I cannot think why he should
choose such a spot, and Westaways good enough for anyone, I
should have thought. I always said he was a strange man, and Mr
Leyland, who is downright if any man is, remarked to me only a
week back that he was growing far too stout for his health. If he
could but give some of his size to his wife, poor woman . .
.'</p>

<p>John appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>'Come, girls. Here's Mr Herries to say that William has the
horses round. Has he not, Mr Herries? That's excellent. William
is always so prompt. Good day to you. Good day. Good day.
<i>Most</i> delightful. Never enjoyed anything more. Come, girls.
<i>Too</i> kind of you, Mrs Herries. It's time we were moving on,
with the snow and everything . . . You must all come over to
Bassenthwaite at the nearest opportunity. Oh, I insist. I take no
refusal. So very good of you, Mrs Herries--'</p>

<p>When the Leylands were out of the room a silence fell.
Jennifer drank her tea. Then she rose.</p>

<p>'There is no peace for us any more here,' she said. 'You may
laugh, Judith, but it is so. He will destroy us all.' Then,
staring at Miss Pennyfeather as though she were seeing her for
the first time, she added: 'They were trampling on the snowdrops.
It is to be a tremendous place with rows of windows. I think I
will go to my room.'</p>

<p>She walked out.</p>

<p>Judith sighed.</p>

<p>'If that isn't unfortunate! Poor Jennifer! And the Leylands
will talk for weeks!' Then taking Miss Pennyfeather's arm she
added: 'Janet, come up with me. You are the most sensible woman I
know. Talk to her. I'm of no service when she's like this.'</p>

<p>So Dorothy and John were left alone. Dorothy saw at once that
her brother was greatly disturbed; he stood there, fingering his
high stock and looking, as she remembered her father had
sometimes looked, as though he were going to be sick. At such a
time she could not help him. She was good about sensible
practical things like a broken leg, a bloody head, a cold in the
chest, but when John was in a mood she was uncomfortable as
though he were improper. Although she was the soul of good nature
and almost always in a good temper, she resented the states into
which her mother and brother sometimes tumbled.</p>

<p>John said at last:</p>

<p>'Nothing can help mother. Now that she has this in her
head.'</p>

<p>'I'll see about some linden tea,' Dorothy said. 'It has
soothed her many a time.' And relieved at an opportunity of
escape, she bustled out.</p>

<p>She had been gone but a moment when Adam came in. Adam was now
fourteen and a half. He had filled out in the last two years and
was deep of chest, thick across the shoulders. His black hair was
always untidy; a lock hung now over his forehead. He was ruddy
with health, with the brown colour that made so many who didn't
know him think him a foreigner, but he was English enough all the
same, with the broad brow, snub nose, large mouth, square body,
short sturdy legs, bright eyes like his mother's. He was English,
too, in his reticence and hatred of demonstration. This affected
him now, for he saw at once that John was worried and would need
his help. John liked demonstrations: there were times when he
wanted Adam to show him that he loved him, and although Adam did
love him more than any human thing save his mother, he hated to
show it. Oh! how he hated it!</p>

<p>He was in rough country things and his high boots were muddy,
for he had been out with Rackstraw, Bennett and the dogs
rabbiting and had had a glorious afternoon. When he saw that
John's distress was so real he thought to himself, 'Let John do
what he likes to me if it helps him.' With a backward glance he
threw reluctantly behind him all the happiness of the afternoon,
the crisp air, the scent of the snow, the yelping of the dogs,
the sunlight breaking in silver across the slow fields.</p>

<p>'Adam, Mother has been to High Ireby. Walter Herries has begun
to build.'</p>

<p>'I knew it,' Adam said quickly. 'Bennett told me.'</p>

<p>'Mother is very unhappy. She came in while the Leylands were
here and spoke as though she were crazy. This will <i>send</i>
her crazy! If I could do something! How I hate him! He comes
nearer and nearer with his sneer and his crooked son and--' He
broke off.</p>

<p>'Pooh!' said Adam, cracking his whip against his boot as grown
men did. 'It's fun, John--fine fun! Why should you care? And your
mother will be better now that it's happened. It has been the
waiting for it . . .'</p>

<p>'I am afraid of nothing else,' John went on. 'Nothing but
this. I'm no coward. You know that I'm not. But Cousin Walter,
since the days when we were small . . . Do you remember that
evening when he rode up to the house and we watched him? And now
that I'm managing the estate it brings me closer to him. Oh,
Adam, I wish that you and Aunt Judith were not going to
London--'</p>

<p>'It's grand!' Adam cried, throwing out his chest. 'There'll be
the coach and the lights, chimneys smoking and everyone shouting,
and mother says we shall go to a theatre--'</p>

<p>'Adam,' John broke in. 'There's something else. I must tell
you. I have been intending so for three months past, but no one
knows. It makes everything so difficult--' He broke off and began
to pace the room. Adam, his legs straddling, waited. 'It's this.
You're to tell no one, Adam.'</p>

<p>'No one,' repeated Adam, and meant it.</p>

<p>It's Elizabeth--Walter's daughter. We are in love. We have
been so for more than two years. It began the night of the Summer
Fair.'</p>

<p>'What!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes . . . Why should it not be? There is no one so
lovely, so good, so lovely--'</p>

<p>'But she is a child, a little girl--'</p>

<p>'She is your own age, Adam. In two years she will be
seventeen--'</p>

<p>'Elizabeth! <i>His</i> daughter!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes . . . I know all that you can say. I have said it
all to myself again and again. But it happened at sight, and now
it is for ever. Nothing can change it.'</p>

<p>Love--love of girls and women--as yet seemed to Adam an
absurdly inexplicable business, a waste of time, a ludicrous
sentimentality. And now this, for a child who was a baby, the
daughter of their greatest enemy whom they had sworn always to
hate, the sister of the loathsome, deformed Uhland . . . An
impulse to despise John rose in his heart and was at once loyally
driven down again.</p>

<p>'Oh, John!'</p>

<p>'Do not pity me. Do not laugh. We love one another for ever,
and so soon as she is old enough we shall marry.'</p>

<p>'No, no, you must not!' Adam caught his arm. 'Uncle Walter's
daughter! . . . I shall never speak to you again if you do!'</p>

<p>'Well, then, don't! I don't care!'</p>

<p>'But, John, how <i>can</i> you? For two years? And you've been
meeting?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes. But not often. We write.'</p>

<p>Adam turned, with a gesture of disgust as though he would
leave the room, but John gripped his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Adam, you must listen. You <i>must.</i> You are the only
friend I have. The only one. I love you more than anyone in the
world save Elizabeth. Again and again we have sworn that nothing
should separate us--'</p>

<p>'Yes, but this--'</p>

<p>'No; you are young. You don't understand--'</p>

<p>'I'm not young.' Adam broke away. 'If you wish to love a girl
you can, but not <i>his</i> daughter.'</p>

<p>'But don't you see? I could not help it. As I breathe so I
love her. You will yourself one day--'</p>

<p>John's eyes caught Adam's and held him. There was an
expression in them that struck to the very depths of Adam's
loyalty and devotion. He knew then that he could never desert
John, never, whatever the crisis.</p>

<p>He muttered something, looking away.</p>

<p>'Mind--it is our secret.'</p>

<p>Adam nodded his head, then said gruffly:</p>

<p>'I must go to the stables. Caesar has a sore leg. Coming?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c106">JUDITH AND ADAM IN LONDON</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They--Judith and Adam--had spent the most glorious night at
the George, Stamford, in the very room, so the landlord himself
informed them, occupied by his Sacred Majesty, King Charles the
First, when he slept there on his way from Newark to Huntingdon
on the night of August 23rd, 1645. This Judith, in ordinary
circumstances, would never have believed (although the room was
splendid with oak beams and a huge four-poster and a small closet
off it where Adam slept and snored), but the fact was that she
was so greatly excited by her journey and by the expectation of
London (where she had not been for so long a time) and by the
temporary escape from Uldale, that she behaved like a child of
ten and was ready to believe anything. One of the drawers
remarked to another of the drawers that he'd never yet seen an
old lady like it. They had had to wait for their adventure for it
was not until the second week in October that they left
Uldale.</p>

<p>Adam was quite as deeply excited as his mother and expressed
his emotions in sudden fiery little sentences, like shots from a
gun, that seemed to have little or no relation to one
another.</p>

<p>Everything was glorious, the long ride in the coach the day
before (Adam had insisted on sitting outside, although it was
terribly cold and there was a place for him inside), the sound of
the horn, the spanking pace of the horses, the incidental humours
of the road and, most especially, the powers and personality of
Mr Joe Dorset, the Coachman, with whom Adam was utterly and
entirely in love.</p>

<p>Then had come the falling dusk, the lights of the town, the
bustling courtyard of the George, the wonderful dinner when, like
a gentleman, Adam had drunk his mother's health in marvellous
claret, sitting up in his chair so straight that he nearly broke
his back in two (he and his mother so grand at a table all to
themselves, while the old gentleman with three chins and two
daughters entertained the table in the middle of the room with
his anecdotes of Tom Hennessey and his shooting adventures in
Scotland), and then the great bedroom in which King Charles had
slept, and his mother going upstairs to it in such stately
fashion, the landlord himself in front with two candles, that you
would have thought her Royalty.</p>

<p>But all this was nothing at all to the glory of the next day
when they started in a pale golden dawn, frost in the air, and
the roans stamping their hoofs to be off. Adam, wrapped in a
hundred coats, had the glory of sitting beside the great Joe with
the old three-chinned gentleman on his other side.</p>

<p>He could observe everything and listen to everything too. He
saw the gold fade from the sky and give place to one of the
loveliest mornings of the year. The fields were yet frosted, the
road was hard; only once had they to travel through water, which
gave Joe (who had a voice like a gurgling water-pipe) occasion to
describe what had happened once to the Stamford Regent when going
through St Neot's, fifty-six miles out of London--how the Ouse
had overflowed its banks there, and although an extra pair of
leaders were put on, ridden by a horse-keeper, yet the water was
up to the axle-trees and even, for a while, the Regent was
afloat, to the dreadful peril of some ladies inside it. And that
led the stout gentleman to talk of Tom Hennessey's famous whip,
which, as everyone knows, was a crooked one so that it could
tickle the lagging wheelers in a fashion no other whip could
achieve. And that led Joe to show what he could do with
<i>his</i> whip, and a stout lady behind them <i>begged</i> him
to be careful and not to hurt the horses, which Adam thought the
funniest thing he'd ever heard. (But then women <i>were</i>
peculiar, all of them, even his mother.)</p>

<p>There came a glorious moment, later in the morning, when Joe
actually entertained Adam himself in conversation.</p>

<p>'And what might <i>your</i> age be, young gentleman?'</p>

<p>'Fifteen.'</p>

<p>'Fifteen! Deary me! Think of that now! . . . Learnt to fight
yet?'</p>

<p>'A little.' (Adam was modest. Rackstraw had taught him
well.)</p>

<p>'Going to see a Fight in London?'</p>

<p>'I hope so.'</p>

<p>'Next week, come Friday, there's the Nottingham Pet and John
Willis at Islington. That'll be something.' Then, after a pause,
'Going to school in London?'</p>

<p>'No; just for a visit.'</p>

<p>'Ever been to London afore?'</p>

<p>'No, never.'</p>

<p>'Ah! That's a treat for a young lad. That's a treat, that is.
All the same the country's better. Live in the North?'</p>

<p>'Yes, in Cumberland.'</p>

<p>'Ever seen the Crusher?'</p>

<p>'No. I'm afraid I haven't.'</p>

<p>'Never seen the Crusher--and live in Cumberland? Why, think of
that now! I remember his fight in Newcastle when he smashed Foxy
Rundle in twenty rounds--in '23 I think it was.' But here the old
gentleman broke in; he hadn't seen the fight himself but he had
heard . . . and here the coach had to be stopped for a lady with
enough baggage for a journey to China, who didn't like this, and
wouldn't have that, until Joe's temper was as purple as the capes
of his riding-coat. And then--somewhere early in the
afternoon--the foretaste of London began to creep upon Adam.
London! London at last! How faint suddenly were Uldale, Skiddaw,
the village shop with the green bottle window . . . Dorothy and
the way she'd take the jars of preserve out of the cupboard and
examine them one by one with a seriousness . . . old Bennett and
the way he'd pinch his leg . . . even John standing there,
looking at Adam, telling him that horrid hateful news, that he
loved Walter's daughter . . . all figures as dim now as the faded
pinks and blues on the Chinese screen in his mother's bedroom!
London!</p>

<p>Already they were at the Peacock at Islington, and the hostler
was shouting, doors were slamming, old Joe Dorset taking up
parcels, answering silly questions from nervous ladies, drinking
out of a jug, examining the horses, reassuring a nervous old
gentleman wrapped in a vast white muffler--and then, in another
moment--Tantivy! Tantivy! Tantivy!--they were off again.</p>

<p>'Are you comfortable, dear?' his mother had asked him, poking
her head out of the window. 'Not too cold?'</p>

<p>'He's all right, ma'am,' Joe Dorset had answered, 'as right as
a 'edge'og'; and Adam had been proud all down his spine.
Certainly he was all right. What a pity his mother hadn't come
outside! She would have enjoyed it. Now, after Islington, lights
flared on the country road, for the dusk is creeping up and out
of it suddenly loom drovers and a herd of cattle. Then Smithfield
and Cow Lane, then up Holborn Hill. But these places were, of
course, nothing to Adam. What did he see? In detail very little,
for mist is everywhere, noise is everywhere--through the mist
lights and flares, a blazing window, a crooked chimney, a barrow
alive with flame. And the noises--hackney cabriolets, drays,
waggons, wheelbarrows, shouting boys, bawling men, screaming
women, ringing bells--and through it all, above it all, beyond it
all, his heart beating like an African drum!</p>

<p>He was never one to show his excitement. He sat now in
absolute silence, his hands tightly clenched together under his
coat, his mouth firmly closed, but his eyes staring, staring as
though they would pierce this foggy, noisy mystery through to the
other side.</p>

<p>Tantivy! Tantivy! Tantivy! He felt now Joe's pride that he was
bringing his coach in on time. How they dashed over the cobbles,
how the roans tossed their heads, how through the murk and gloom
one could dimly feel figures sliding, horses slipping, voices
shouting to be out of the way. Then, one more blast and into a
courtyard of light and splendour the Stamford Regent dashes. The
George and Blue Boar, Holborn: London's heart is touched at
last.</p>

<p>He discovered then, quite to his own surprise, that he was
extremely sleepy; he discovered, too, for the first time in his
young life, what every traveller discovers, that once at a
destination and the life that only a moment earlier had been
pulsating with fire and energy is collapsed at your feet like a
spent balloon.</p>

<p>Even Joe Dorset was fading. Not that he wouldn't be pleased to
meet Joe again somewhere, but his figure was shrunk and his voice
sounded miles away.</p>

<p>No, his mother was once again the centre of his world. She
dominated the place, sending hostlers here and stable-boys there,
collecting their luggage, standing over it, ordering a hackney
cabriolet, and all as quietly but as imperiously as though London
were at her feet and knew it.</p>

<p>'Now, Adam,' she commanded. 'In you get!' And in he did get,
into the mustiest, smelliest, darkest interior that his
enterprising life had yet known. Mice, straw, newspapers, stale
beer and damp cloth all seemed to have gone to the making of that
hackney cab. There was indeed straw on the floor of it and old
newspaper squeezed into the hinge of one of the windows. The
driver was a little man with a pinched white nose and no
eyebrows. He seemed to be terrified of Judith, for when she said,
'Number Nine, Cadogan Place,' he almost bowed to the ground.</p>

<p>They were crushed together inside the cab, for they were piled
round with parcels and small boxes. Judith put her arm around
him, and so they bumped and jumped and swayed and sank as though
on a tempestuous sea. Houses rose and fell beyond the misty
windows, horses loomed gigantic, figures sprang up before them
and vanished again, and in Adam's nostrils was that smell with
which he would associate London all his life long--straw, ale,
and the faint scent of violets that stole from his mother's
clothes.</p>

<p>They had arrived. The cab had stopped with a jerk, the door
creaked open, and a little boy with a large broom was there on
the pavement, his hand out, begging.</p>

<p>When Judith had given the little boy a shilling (which
astonished him very much and led the driver of the cabriolet to
wet his lips in anticipation) the big solemn door (supported by
black marble pillars) was slowly opened and a very thin footman
with powdered hair and an ornamental waistcoat stood there
staring at them. It seemed from his expression that he could not
believe that anyone should be arriving in a hackney cab at that
particular moment, but Judith walked straight past him as though
she were the Queen of Egypt, and then, remembering that the
driver had not yet been paid, hurried down again, directed the
bringing-in of the luggage, smiled at the footman, said her name
in a very determined manner, and entered the house a second time,
on this occasion followed closely by Adam.</p>

<p>The hall was so extremely dark and a lamp by the staircase so
exceedingly dim that a white bust of a gentleman with a lot of
hair and naked shoulders, and a large picture of Moses addressing
the Children of Israel, were the only things for a long while
visible.</p>

<p>'Madame Paris,' said Judith again. 'We are expected.'</p>

<p>The footman disappeared and returned to say, 'This way,
Madame,' disregarding Adam altogether. He, however, was
determined not to be left alone in that darkness, and setting his
face into its ugliest scowl (his manner when he was 'against the
world') stumped along behind her. They were shown into a very
large drawing room that seemed to Adam, accustomed to the bright
colour of Uldale, the most funereal he had ever seen. There were
two large white marble pillars at one end, dark brown curtains
across the windows, a huge portrait of a gentleman with a white
stock and an immense watch-chain over the white marble
mantelpiece, a long bookcase buried in glass, and a marble
pedestal with a simpering bust of a lady's head on it between the
windows.</p>

<p>All this he quickly observed, and then he noticed the people
present. (He had ample time for this because no one spoke to him
during the first five minutes.) Mr Newmark he knew already, his
high stock, his large nose, his long legs. He seemed more
dignified than was possible for a flesh-and-blood human being to
be. Mrs Newmark he knew too. He liked her. He noticed that she
had grown very stout. There was an elderly gentleman in a brown
wig, an elderly lady in a vast hat, and a very pretty young lady
in a most bewitching poke-bonnet of the lightest blue. So,
standing near the door, rubbing one leg against the other, he
watched the greetings.</p>

<p>'Judith! . . . Judith!' Phyllis Newmark ran forward, kissed
her again and again, dragged her to the fire. There was nothing
false or affected about Phyllis.</p>

<p>'Oh, you are here! You have arrived! After all that
<i>dreadful</i> journey! You must be frozen indeed. Frozen.
Simply frozen. We have been expecting you these ages, have we
not, Stephen?'</p>

<p>Mr Newmark, unbending in a slow solemn process from the crown
of his head to the middle of his extremely thin waist, greeted
them with the manner of one of England's Ambassadors receiving a
deputation from a foreign tribe. He hoped that the journey had
not been too positively inclement. Judith, her eyes twinkling,
assured him that it had not.</p>

<p>'And this is Mr Pomeroy.'</p>

<p>The gentleman in the brown wig kissed her hand.</p>

<p>'And Mrs Pomeroy.'</p>

<p>'And this is Sylvia--Sylvia Herries, Garth's wife. You know
Durward's son.'</p>

<p>The eyes of the young lady in the poke-bonnet--eyes alive with
merriment and impudence--and the eyes of Judith--also, although
so much older, alive with merriment--met, and in that instant the
two of them, the girl of twenty and the woman of fifty-six, were
friends for life. Judith seldom made a mistake. She had not made
one now.</p>

<p>'Is not that perfect that you are here at last? Is it not
wonderful, Mrs Pomeroy? All the way from Cumberland. Oh, I must
embrace you once more. I am so <i>very</i> glad to see you.
Stephen, is it not excellent that they have arrived safe and
sound?'</p>

<p>'And there is my Adam,' said Judith, turning round. She knew
that it must mean some real sacrifice of his principles that
Stephen should receive a little bastard into the very heart of
his sanctified family. It had been Phyllis' doing, of course.
Nevertheless, it was good of him. She would not forget it. Adam
came forward. Although there was always something clumsy in his
movements, Judith had taught him good manners. He bowed and said:
'How are you, sir?' 'How are you, ma'am?' 'Very well, I thank
you, ma'am.'</p>

<p>What the next step might have been no one could tell, for
there came, suddenly, a portentous and dramatic knocking on the
door--in fact, two knocks, most solemnly delivered, with a proper
interval between.</p>

<p>'Come in!' cried Mr Newmark.</p>

<p>The door slowly opened and a procession entered. First, a
tall, severe woman in black silk, then in order, it seemed, of
ages, all the Newmark children. When Judith had last seen them at
Westaways there had been but three; now there were seven if you
included (as indeed you must) an infant who, in the arms of a
stout, bonneted nurse, brought up the rear. The procession
assembled itself at the door and waited.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Miss Trindle,' said Mr Newmark in his deep
bell-like tones.</p>

<p>'Good evening, sir. Good evening, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Come, children,' said Mr Newmark. 'You may bid us
goodnight.'</p>

<p>Then they all advanced--Horace, aged eleven, first, then Mary,
aged ten, Phyllis nine, Katherine seven, Stephen five, Emily four
and the infant Barnabas of almost no age at all.</p>

<p>The Ceremony was magnificent.</p>

<p>Horace was a thin, pale-faced boy, large spectacles covering
wide-open, anxious eyes. He advanced timidly to his father, gave
an absurd little bow, 'Goodnight, Papa.'</p>

<p>Mr Newmark bent down and in a dignified but kindly fashion
kissed his cheek. Horace then went round and bowed to the others.
'Goodnight, sir.' 'I wish you a goodnight, ma'am.' He came to
Judith, who caught him up and kissed him on both cheeks,
disarranging his spectacles. He looked at her quickly, then
carefully straightened his glasses. He paused before Adam and
gave him a comical twinkling look, as much as to say: 'This is
all very absurd. Don't think I'm taken in by it.' His mother
hugged him in a quite human manner.</p>

<p>The others followed. Mary was stout and plain. Phyllis slender
and pretty. Katherine stolid. Stephen nervous of his father.
Emily yawning. Barnabas from the arms of the nurse gazed at his
father as though he had never seen anything so droll in his life.
They were all marshalled at the door and, together, standing in a
row, made a simultaneous bow.</p>

<p>'And now,' said Phyllis (she was blushing a little), 'let us
come upstairs and I will show you and Adam your apartments. Mrs
Pomeroy, pray, forgive. We shall speedily return.'</p>

<p>Their rooms that night were of an icy chill, but English men
and women were hardened--not for them the soft and effete
comforts of more degenerate nations. Nevertheless, both Judith
and Adam slept like the dead, bathed next morning in round tin
baths brought in elaborately by a heavily breathing,
muscle-straining maidservant. They were both in time for Family
Prayers, held in the long, cold dining room. Beyond the windows
as Mr Newmark read (as it seemed to Judith) almost the whole of
the first Epistle to the Corinthians, a yellow fog wriggled and
bridled up and down the Square.</p>

<p>But it was afterwards, over empty eggcups, vast cold hams and
two terrific coffee-pots that Judith heard a most interesting
discourse from Stephen Newmark. As Judith sat there listening she
decided that she liked him better, far better, than she could
ever have supposed that she would. He was at his best, serious,
informed and exceedingly interesting. As he propelled his long,
thin body up and down the breakfast-room, speaking in his deep,
measured voice, he was like some prophet of old proclaiming woe
to all the world. And yet he was not unduly sensational, did not,
she was convinced, go further than the facts warranted. Being an
intelligent, active-minded woman, she had, even in the confines
of Cumberland, realized the critical time through which England
was passing--and not only England but all the civilized world.
The Revolution in France that very summer had been sufficient to
point a packet of morals. The riot at Uldale ending in poor
Reuben Sunwood's death had driven home all the local lessons. She
had felt, for years past, what every other thinking man and woman
had felt, that one cry, one lifted rifle, one more revelation of
the filth, degradation, misery in which half England was living,
might precipitate here a Revolution worse than any France had
ever known. But Newmark dealt with facts, and facts only.
Huskisson's death on September 15th, at the opening of the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway, seemed to him a sort of omen.
He returned to it again and again: such a fine man, one of the
few men of intelligence in the country, such a foolish accident!
These Railways--you were at the mercy of these horrible engines.
One day it would be all engines. Human beings would be crushed by
them. Will Herries had been there, had been standing quite close
to Mr Huskisson at the time. He would tell her all about it.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose that I shall be seeing Will,' said Judith
grimly.</p>

<p>'No?' said Stephen, surprised. 'You will find him now a man of
very great importance.'</p>

<p>'I don't doubt,' said Judith.</p>

<p>After that the general lawlessness, the riots at Otmoor in
Oxfordshire, followed by the calling out of the military at
Oxford, Captain Swing and his rick-burning, the hanging of three
men by the High Sheriff in Somersetshire, an execution witnessed
by fifteen thousand people, the stirring up of the people
everywhere by Cobbett and Carlyle, outrages in Kent and Wilts, in
Bucks and Surrey, followed always by summary executions.</p>

<p>Then to London--dirt and starvation and wretchedness cheek by
jowl with a luxury, extravagance and heartlessness that had never
been witnessed before in any living man's memory. Materialism,
immorality of the grossest, an utter scoffing disregard of
religion.</p>

<p>'They say,' Stephen burst out, 'that all this is still the
effect of the wars. But, good God, this is 1830--Waterloo was in
'15!'</p>

<p>He passed on, growing ever more agitated beneath his cold and
pedantic exterior, to the King, the Court and the burning
question of Reform. The King was an old fool. They had hoped, in
the summer when George, unregretted by anyone alive, had at last
seen fit to die, that this honest, worthy old man who succeeded
him would save his country. But this honest, worthy old man was
nothing but a fool, nay, a maniac. Everyone had been pleased at
first by his easy, simple manners. He was crazy from the first,
wouldn't have his own servants in mourning, but had ordered Mrs
Fitzherbert to put hers into black, put on his plain clothes and
went wandering into the streets where he was followed all the way
up St James's by a mob until a woman, outside White's, pushed her
way through and kissed him; had a party at Buckingham House and
dismissed the people by saying: 'Time you were off. Come along to
bed, my Queen.'</p>

<p>'Well, you know, Judith, it isn't amusing. No, indeed, it is
not. In such times to have such a crazy old monarch. A bad effect
on anybody.'</p>

<p>And for the rest where was a man we could trust? The Duke,
Peel, Lord John Brougham--all mad about this Reform one way or
another. What's the Cabinet to do? It spends all its time sitting
to concoct proclamations offering rewards for the discovery of
rioters, rick-burners. That's not the way a country ought to be
governed.</p>

<p>Stephen's agitation was truly genuine. You could not listen to
him and not respect him. You could not listen to him and not
think of that little procession of the night before nor see that
it was in his mind that all of them from Horace to young Barnabas
might have their throats cut by the mob any of these days. And
meanwhile, the candles guttered within, outside the yellow fog
went sliding and whispering among the tall black houses. Judith,
in spite of herself, shivered. The room was so desperately
cold.</p>

<p>'We have forgotten God!' cried Stephen, 'and God will punish
us.'</p>

<p>But then he cheered up a little, and, pouring himself out a
cup of what must have been very chilly coffee, lifted his voice a
tone and began to talk about 'Our Family'.</p>

<p>It amused Judith greatly to discover that he considered
himself completely a Herries and his children Herries too. They
were the nephews and nieces of Lord Rockage and cousins to all
the Herries tribe and that was enough for him. Whoever the
Newmarks were or had ever been they were now altogether behind
the curtain. She saw that it was his idea that the Herries were
going to save the country, if not in the foreground of affairs,
why, then, very active in the background.</p>

<p>But Will Herries <i>was</i> in the foreground; it was expected
that he would be a baronet any day. And there was Carey Rockage a
peer, James Herries ('stupid pompous Ass <i>he</i> is') a
baronet, Sylvia Herries, Garth's wife, 'one of the loveliest,
wittiest girls in town,' Walter adding field to field in the
North, Jennifer's boy (as he had heard) one of the handsomest
young fellows in England, and she, Judith, herself--</p>

<p>'And I, Stephen?' asked Judith, laughing.</p>

<p>'Well, anyone with half an eye--'</p>

<p>In short, she became aware that she had, in a very few hours,
made a strong impression upon Stephen. It was idle to pretend
that she was not pleased. All her old love of power came surging
up within her. She began already to realize that this visit to
London was going to rouse in her another crisis, a crisis not
unsimilar to the one that had driven her to abandon Watendlath.
She had been too long up there buried in the country. Here were
the Herries going up, up, up. Here was she, even though she
<i>was</i> fifty-six (and she didn't feel a day more than
thirty), with all these conquests ready to her hand. A sudden
violent distaste attacked her--a distaste of Jennifer with her
crazy imaginings, the stout bullying form of Walter, the
littleness and gossip of Keswick, the long slow curve of the
Uldale hills--</p>

<p>'We are becoming every day more powerful as a family,'
proclaimed Stephen. 'Will is intimate with Peel. He is throwing
himself into these new Railways. He grows richer every hour.
Carey's boy, Roger, is only nineteen but shows excellent
political ambitions. My own boy Horace--' He broke off as though
this were too personal. Then added: 'These are the times for
people like ourselves. The best class in England, the soundest,
the most solid. Money, brains, beauty--and a proper fear of
God.'</p>

<p>He broke off and finished his cup of coffee. Strange, she
thought, considering him, how although he was not a Herries he
was proclaiming himself so curiously a cousin to Will, Walter,
the Venerable Archdeacon Rodney, Jennifer's father and the
others. All the qualities that her own father had so sadly
lacked, and Francis and Reuben and now, she feared, young John.
And she herself--she was a combination of the two opposites, the
only one in the family who was so, which was exactly why she
could, if she liked, dominate the lot of them!</p>

<p>'Stephen!' she cried. 'I shall enjoy my time in London!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From the moment of that breakfast-hour she never ceased to
realize that this visit was a crisis for her and for her Adam as
well. Adam himself had indeed the most glorious time. It was as
though Stephen relaxed his pomposity and Phyllis her housewifely
burdens under the influence of their visitors. The
children--Horace, Mary, Phyllis--had never known such a time.
Either with their mother or with the grim Miss Trindle they
discovered all the glories of the Town for Adam's benefit. They
went to Miss Linwood's Exhibition of Needlework Pictures, and saw
the Malediction of Cain and Jeptha's Vow, to Barford's Panorama
where were wonderful displays of foreign scenes. One of the most
marvellous of all things was the Panorama of London at the
Colosseum in Regent's Park, where, raised in a lift (the wonder
of the Town), you saw the Conservatories, Swiss Cottage, Alpine
Scenery. In St Martin's Lane was the pavilion of the gigantic
whale which was found dead off the coast of Belgium on November
3rd, 1827. This skeleton was ninety-five feet long and eighteen
broad, and for another shilling you might sit 'in the belly of
the whale'. This both Horace and Adam were permitted to do. But
better still were the Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park (only
opened in 1828 and therefore still a sensation) and (best, oh,
far best of all for Adam and Horace) 'Weeks' Mechanical
Exhibition' in Tichborne Street, where you might see an automaton
tarantula spider made of steel which moved its claws and horns,
an animated white mouse formed of oriental pearls that ran about
a table 'feeding at pleasure', a caterpillar of enamelled gold
and brilliants feeding on the foliage of a golden tree, and an
old woman who, at a call, came forth from her cottage, walked
about supported by crutches 'while the joints in her arms and
legs are all in apparently natural motion'.</p>

<p>For Judith, too, her progress about London during that first
week was one thrilling adventure. All her earlier doings there
rushed up to her as though they had occurred but yesterday, a
strange haphazard married life with Georges, money one day, none
the next, the visit to the 'Elephant' when the coach had
overturned, the famous Ball, the awful moment in the Square when
Georges told her that he must flee for his life--that other
world, a London so different from this, so ancient, gone like a
dream with its colours, its fans and powder and elegance, and
Georges, dear, dear Georges, so feckless, so venturesome, so
unreliable, beside her now at every step, his hand through her
arm in the old persuasive way, forcing her to agree to something
weak or hopeless or mad.</p>

<p>Georges, Georges . . . And here she was an old lady of
fifty-six with a boy of fifteen who ought to have been Georges'
son but wasn't, in this Town that Mr Nash had covered with
whitewash, where poverty of the most hideous mingled with riches
of the most extravagant, where the very pavement seemed to
threaten, at any moment, an earthquake.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second week she encountered Will.</p>

<p>She was sitting before a small, smoky, cold fire in the
marble-pillared drawing room, her feet on the fender, plucking up
her energy to go up to her icy bedroom and dress for dinner, when
the footman opened the door, murmured something and withdrew. She
looked round to see Will standing there. The same old Will, only
grander. He carried his years well. He did not look sixty nor
anything like it. Sixty! And it was only yesterday that, a boy on
a horse outside Stone Ends, he had listened to a child, Judith,
declaring firmly that she would not return to Uldale, no, not if
she died for it! He did not look sixty and he did not look as
though he could conceivably be Walter's father. He was dressed
most handsomely in black. His coat was so waisted that it gave
him an almost feminine appearance, but he was not feminine. Oh,
dear me, no!</p>

<p>If he was startled at seeing Judith, he gave no sign of it.
Her pale face was yet paler. She looked at him with all the
distant haughtiness that she could command, but in her heart she
wished that she did not instantly once again feel like a child in
pantalettes.</p>

<p>'Why, Judith!' he said. He came forward and gravely shook her
hand. 'I thought that I should see you. I heard that you were in
Town.' Then he added, smiling a little: 'It has been unkind of
you not to pay Christabel a visit.'</p>

<p>She did not answer that but said:</p>

<p>'Phyllis has not yet returned. Won't you sit down?'</p>

<p>He did--with great care and dignity.</p>

<p>'Well--how are you, Judith?'</p>

<p>'In excellent health, thank you, Will.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear it. And your boy?'</p>

<p>'Also in excellent health.'</p>

<p>'Good.'</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>'And how are all at Uldale?'</p>

<p>'Admirable, thank you.'</p>

<p>'Good. I hear that John is a fine boy. You yourself, Judith,
look younger than ever.'</p>

<p>She said nothing to that, but wished for the millionth time
that God had made her taller. Then he went on--his voice was now
exceedingly measured and assured as though he were always
accustomed to speaking to people of the utmost importance:</p>

<p>'I am glad that Phyllis has not yet returned. It gives us a
moment for speaking together, Judith. You are fifty-six' (how
characteristic of him to remember her age!) 'I am sixty. Is it
not rather childish of us to continue this feud?'</p>

<p>'I am continuing no feud,' she answered. 'You had better ask
Walter about feuds.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Walter!' he sighed. 'Walter is very headstrong. I admit
that that has been in part my fault--my fault and his mother's.
But he would have his own way from earliest childhood. And are
you not imagining things, my dear Judith? You also, if I may say
so, have always had plenty of character.'</p>

<p>'Imagining!' she broke out. 'Imagining!' Then, controlling
herself, she went on: 'You know, perhaps, that he is building on
a hill above Uldale simply that he may overlook us and interfere
with us in every possible way.'</p>

<p>'He told me that he was to build,' Will said quietly. 'I
advised him against it.'</p>

<p>'He murdered Francis,' she said, 'and he is frightening
Jennifer into her grave.' She saw then that she touched him. At
the mention of Francis a faint flush coloured his sallow
cheeks.</p>

<p>'Francis,' he said at last. 'Poor Francis! He was his own
enemy.'</p>

<p>'He need not have been,' she answered hotly. 'It was because
of Walter's spies that Francis learnt of Jennifer's
infidelity.'</p>

<p>But he was not to be stirred.</p>

<p>'Is not this all rather old history, Judith, my dear? There
are two strains in our family--let us face it--and they are never
at peace together. I was never at one with Francis myself. We
sought different things out of the world. What he sought for was
perhaps harder to obtain than what I sought for. He never found
it, and in his disappointment--No, no, my dear. You cannot lay
all that upon Walter. You know the world too well. You are
altogether too wise.'</p>

<p>She considered that. There was something in what he said. Then
she began in another more friendly, more impetuous tone.</p>

<p>'Will--cannot you persuade Walter to cease this building?
Cannot you persuade him to leave Jennifer and her children in
quiet? Then we will be friends. I shall be only too happy.'</p>

<p>He looked at her with a strange, almost human, smile.</p>

<p>'Persuade Walter? My dear, he has gone far beyond <i>my</i>
persuading. I have no influence over him whatever. He would even
rather that his mother and I did not come to Westaways.' He
waited a moment and then continued: 'You know, Judith, I have all
my life been pursuing money--money and power. I have got both. I
do not regret it. But in that pursuit one loses other things. I
have lost human relationships. I have no time for them. As I say,
I do not regret it. But it is so.'</p>

<p>She felt herself being drawn closer to him than she had ever
been before.</p>

<p>He went on: 'Once, years ago, when we were children--do you
remember?--we were watching fireworks on the Lake, you, Francis,
Reuben Sunwood and I. We all said what we would do with our
lives. I have fulfilled almost exactly those early ambitions. I
would not, however, say that I am a happy man. But who is happy?
I have my moments. That is, I suppose, as much as one may
ask.'</p>

<p>She heard the opening of the outer door and then the
comfortable friendly tone of Phyllis's voice, so hurriedly she
said:</p>

<p>'Will, I have no unfriendliness to yourself or
Christabel--none whatever--but I will fight like a tiger to keep
Jennifer and her children safe. I may be an aged tiger and not a
very large one, but I can still be fierce. I am Walter's enemy so
long as he is Jennifer's and John's and Dorothy's, so now you
know.'</p>

<p>Will looked at her gravely and opened his mouth as though he
would speak, but Phyllis' entry in a bustle of welcome prevented
him. There was some chatter, and Will got up to depart. It was
only then that he said to them with great solemnity:</p>

<p>'My reason for calling--I should have told you before--I
thought that you would like to know. His Majesty has graciously
offered me a Baronetcy which I shall accept.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yes, indeed, the Herries were going up, and Judith shared now
in all the drama of family life to the full. It took her only a
fortnight to be considered the most impressive figure among them
all.</p>

<p>The Family Letters of this time are filled with references to
her:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Madame Paris has been the Family Sensation this week. Your
father is laid up with the gout but he <i>PERMITTED</i> me (you
know what he is) to dine at Lady Rosbey's. Our cousin, Judith
(<i>IS</i> she a cousin?) arrived with the Newmarks and in
<i>FIVE MINUTES</i> had the whole room laughing. She must be
<i>ANY AGE</i> and wears the most outrageous colours.
Nevertheless, she was sprightly as a kitten and without losing
her dignity an instant. She was as up in everything as though
she'd never moved out of Belgravia and kept us all vastly amused
with her Paris adventures in '15 where it appears that she . .

<p> </p>

<p>And another:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judith Paris is the rage. I must confess that I find her
charming for she is kindly as well as intelligent, enjoys
everything as though she were born yesterday (she's fifty if a
day!), and is no <i>snob</i> like dear William and others of our
relations. She has with her an illegitimate boy (they say he is
Warren Forster's son. You remember Warren--a little <i>peaked</i>
man with a nervous habit of snapping his fingers) and takes him
about with a great deal of pride. It is a thousand pities that
she should be buried in the North for we sadly need her
<i>esprit</i> and intelligence . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>And a third:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We dined last night at the Bulwers in Hertford Street. That
amusing young man, whom you enjoyed so greatly at Barnet last
year, was there, Mr Disraeli. Rosina Bulwer was a sight!
Plastered with jewels and painted to the eyes, while Bulwer
himself glittered all over! There were plenty of the Family as
you may suppose and of all people the solemn Newmark and his fat
dowdy Phyllis. However, the excuse for their coming was our
cousin Judith from Cumberland. I had heard of her often enough
and was all eagerness to behold her. Well she is a little short
pale-faced thing with grey hair and had a dress of brocaded pink
gauze (of all things for a woman over fifty!). She carried an
ivory cane and should have been altogether absurd. But she was
not! Disraeli was enchanted with her and Rosina talked to her an
immense deal and even Miss Landon admitted her 'ton'. I can tell
you how she does it. By being perfectly natural, having plenty of
humour and common sense. I never saw anyone enjoy herself so
completely . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Indeed she did. She went everywhere, did everything, and knew,
for the moment, no weariness. Sylvia Herries was her principal
companion. That girl, with her eagerness, sense of adventure and
gaiety that had at its heart some undefined melancholy, was
designed for her affections. Then suddenly Judith woke. That
'unhappiness' was everywhere, hidden by a superficial eagerness
that had no stability.</p>

<p>She saw that she was in a society where nothing was real,
where no one believed in anything at all, where everyone feared
what the morrow would bring. The 'Silver Fork' novels of
fashionable life, just then beginning to be so popular, were
symptomatic of the falsehood and sham, while cruel and malicious
sheets like the <i>Age</i> and the <i>John Bull</i> of Theodore
Hook showed where the rottenness was hidden.</p>

<p>Prolonged war had killed sincerity, every kind of faith,
social behaviour. The world of London that she, for a moment,
invaded was dominated by a new aristocracy of wealth, an
aristocracy without tradition, without breeding, an aristocracy
that in its aggressive uneasiness suffered itself to be
blackmailed by the vilest panders and the most worthless
adventurers. Most of the great houses in London were occupied by
'new men' who hurried to learn manners that could never truly be
theirs and sought with drink, gambling, orgies and ostentation,
to give a semblance of splendour and security. The roads to
prominence lay through scandal, back-biting and jealousy. Sport,
jewels, wild expenditure covered meanness and vice. All was fake;
for a woman to be virtuous proclaimed her dowdy. Men lived by
their wits and climbed relentlessly over the backs of their
dearest friends.</p>

<p>Such was the fashionable world of which Judith had a glimpse.
But it was in just such a world that the opportunities of such a
family as the Herries--sober, careful, traditional--lay.</p>

<p>The Herries in London were separated into three parts--the
business Herries, Will at their head, James the baronet following
rather clumsily, and Amery Herries, Sylvia's brother-in-law, very
able and sharp, a possible successor when Will was in his dotage.
There were secondly the religious Herries, headed by Stephen
Newmark, who, as Judith soon perceived, when he was not sensible,
was <i>very</i> tiresome indeed. Stephen had his pet
clergyman--Mr Aubrey Grant of St Anne's, Pimlico--a gentleman
very often at Stephen's table, a stout effeminate, purring
gentleman, adored by the ladies and detested by Judith. There was
also in the Newmark household the Methodist tradition of the
Rockage family in which Phyllis had been brought up. Maria
Rockage was still alive, a kindly rheumatic old Dowager in the
place in Wiltshire. She was for ever sending the Newmark family
pamphlets--'The Miner's Lament', 'The Royal Road to Hell', 'The
Shopman's Vision'--interspersed with delightful, gay and very
human epistles. She lamented grievously that she could not come
up to London to see Judith, who had once lived with her for
nearly ten years and whom she adored. Many of Mr Aubrey Grant's
congregation came to Cadogan Place--old Mr and Mrs Pomeroy were
very prominent--and quite awful Judith found them all. The scent
on Mr Grant's handkerchief alone was enough to send her out of
the room when he was there.</p>

<p>The third division was the social one. Into this, at times,
the other two divisions penetrated, but Will and Christabel,
Newmark and Phyllis, various Newmark cousins, did not truly
belong.</p>

<p>Sylvia Herries, young though she was, was mistress here. She
knew the London social, literary, Bohemian world completely. She
laughingly declared that all the adventurers in London came to
her tiny house in Brook Street. Indeed she did not care who came.
She kept open house. Neither she nor Garth--now a very elegant,
charming young man--seemed to have much money. They were for ever
in desperate straits. Will--who was in these days more generous
than of old--must have helped them again and again. They reminded
Judith constantly of herself and Georges in those old, mad,
adventurous days. That was perhaps why she came to care for them
more than any other of the Herries relations, and why she made
her alliance with them. Sylvia was her own kind--audacious,
reckless, pleasure-loving, but also serious, practical and wise
about other people.</p>

<p>It soon became obvious that Stephen disliked her constant
visits to the little house in Brook Street, a little house that
was all light colours, jingling pianos, poodle dogs and noise.
There were authors like the Bulwers, Letitia Landon, Theodore
Hook, young Ainsworth, of whom he could not possibly approve.
There were dancers, opera singers, racing men and ladies of
extremely doubtful reputation. Judith had, alas, no more of those
fine serious conversations with which on the first morning she
had been honoured. It seemed to him really lamentable that a
woman of her years should care for such a world. He had been
right, as he constantly told Phyllis in the sacredness of their
huge four-poster, in wondering whether anyone so brazen about her
bastard child was a suitable guest for them, and poor Phyllis,
who loved Judith with all her heart, tried to keep the peace. But
what Phyllis really did not understand was that Judith should be
so deeply horrified at the present state of the London world and
yet enjoy the parties in Brook Street so greatly. She seemed like
two different women in one.</p>

<p>Then the climax arrived. On an afternoon of the third week of
Judith's stay, Sylvia Herries was alone with Judith in the
Newmark drawing-room. Sylvia was looking most bewitching with her
ringlets, rose-coloured tulle, a waist so small as to be almost
invisible, and a printed satin scarf. She danced about the room
like a fairy, she bowed with mock ceremony to the pedestal and
the lady's head thereon, she imitated Stephen, whom she found
entirely ridiculous. Judith also was seized with a devil. She
valsed with Sylvia round and round the room. The 'valse' was
still new enough to be divine. They danced ever more madly. They
danced into a small table that held a large preposterous vase of
the brightest green. It tumbled with a crash to the ground, and,
of course, at that precise moment Stephen entered with old Mr
Pomeroy.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be said, nothing to be done. There the
vase was in a thousand pieces. There were the two ladies--one of
them old enough to be the other's mother--hot, dishevelled, and
Judith had, a moment before, lost one of her shoes. Stephen gave
one of his grim sacrificial smiles, Sylvia departed with a
private <i>moue</i> of amusement for Judith's benefit (seen,
however, by Stephen). Judith did her best to become, quickly
again, an elderly dignified lady.</p>

<p>'Oh, it is of no importance, no importance at all,' said
Stephen, bending stiffly to pick up some pieces. 'An old family
heirloom--but still--no matter, no matter.'</p>

<p>But he never forgave Judith that broken vase. An ivory fan, a
green vase: these are the things of which family histories are
made. It was quite clear--Stephen now made it plainly
apparent--that it was time that the visit of Judith and Adam came
to an end.</p>

<p>'Come and stay with us, darling,' said Sylvia. 'For as long as
you please.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Judith. 'Cumberland is my proper place.'</p>

<p>And it <i>was.</i> She would not, she knew, be happy in the
little house in Brook Street. <i>That</i> was not her home, any
more than was Stephen's. Her holiday (and oh! how she had enjoyed
it!) was at an end.</p>

<p>So she looked round her to collect herself and her things, and
found Adam. Not that she at all had forgotten him. It had been
wonderful to see him against this new background and with new
people. She found that he was enterprising, reserved and
extraordinarily generous. She had known all these things about
him since the beginning of time, but they wore a fresh dress in
this fresh world. His generosity was surely astonishing, for he
had very little money unless his London relations gave him some.
In any case he was always buying things for the little Newmarks,
for his mother, for Phyllis. To Sylvia, whom he worshipped, he
gave nothing. All the little Newmarks loved him, even the
spectacled Horace, who was not lavish with his affections. Mary
and her sister Phyllis would be demonstrative, but he shrank from
their demonstrations with horror. He allowed no one any physical
approach. He produced a toy, a doll, a horse, a rattle for the
baby, flowers or whatever, and he said 'Here!' or 'That's for
you, ma'am'. He looked at you sternly while he presented it,
forbidding you to thank him. Then he escaped. He escaped very
often, went off on his own affairs. He was, in fact, very happy
during this visit.</p>

<p>The visit came to a close, both for Judith and Adam, with an
adventure that it was not likely that they would forget. It was
the recurrent adventure of Judith's life: once, in London, a boy
hanging; twice, in Paris, an elephant escaping; and now, the
third time.</p>

<p>On the evening of Monday the eighth of November, Amery Herries
took Judith, Adam and his sister-in-law Sylvia to the Adelphi
Theatre to witness a performance of <i>The Heart of London,</i>
or <i>A Sharper's Progress,</i> by William Thomas Moncrieff. This
was a glorious play, and although not intended for the young did
Adam no kind of harm.</p>

<p>The play over, they stepped from one melodrama into
another.</p>

<p>The Strand, lit with the flares of burning stakes carried
head-high, and in the distance towards Covent Garden by an
overturned cart that had been set alight, showed a wild fantasy
of faces, a mob that now was stagnant like a dead pond and then
broken as though by a whipping wind, all this driven by a roar
that had nothing human in it save an occasional woman's
scream.</p>

<p>The citizens of London, excited by Mr Hunt at a meeting at the
Rotunda in Blackfriars Road, were making their way to the West
End that they might assist the cause of Reform. As soon as the
shouts were heard the doors of the Adelphi were closed, but
Amery's party had slipped out five minutes earlier, to secure a
hackney coach. The doors were closed behind them; before they
could consider their position they were swung forward into the
street. Judith, Adam's arm through hers, saw neither Amery nor
Sylvia again that night.</p>

<p>It was as though Judith and Adam fell into a jungle of
undergrowth. Above them bodies towered and whether they wished it
or no they were carried forward to the cries of 'Down with the
Police!' 'Reform!' 'No Peel!' 'No Wellington!'</p>

<p>Down there in the undergrowth they conversed:</p>

<p>'Never mind, Mother: I'm here,' said Adam.</p>

<p>'Now, don't you let go!' Judith said crossly. This was
impertinence, to treat her and her son in this fashion. A light
swung to the sky, and stars escaping, a golden net scattered
among the chimney-pots. Then the sky was darkened, and a large
face attached to a stout body in moleskins was rosy in the glare
of a burning stake stinking of tar.</p>

<p>'No Wellington! Down with Wellington!' roared the moleskins
most good-naturedly. He stank of gin, and his hand, roughened
with honest toil, stroked Judith's cheek.</p>

<p>At that touch fear, that she had known so seldom in her life,
caught her and pressed against her. A bear tortured, a boy
hanged, Adam's father clinging to her while the horses' hoofs
pranced in the air, these once again encompassed her.</p>

<p>'Reform! Reform!' shrieked a woman, her hair about her face
and a basket on her arm. Judith looked at Adam and saw that he
was quite unafraid and greatly enjoying everything.</p>

<p>'Adam, in a moment there should be a turning to the river.
Watch for it!'</p>

<p>But the impetuous movement ceased. Staring around her she saw
that their progress had been far more rapid than she had
supposed, for they were in Downing Street and had halted in front
of Lord Bathurst's residence. She knew the house well, for Garth
Herries had taken her to a reception there. By squirming her body
through a funny jumble of legs, chests, arms and hands she found
a corner for Adam and herself against some railings, and was able
to observe from there how a gentleman, his face crimson with
rage, came out on to the balcony. He was armed with a brace of
pistols and, shouting in a voice thick with anger, told them that
if they committed any illegal act he would fire. Groans, yells,
shouts of 'Go it! Go it!' answered him, whereupon another
gentleman arrived on the balcony and took the pistols from him.
Then everyone cheered and seemed suddenly radiant with good
spirits.</p>

<p>At that same moment Judith perceived that Adam was gone. She
became at once a frenzied woman. Any self-control that she had
ever learnt, any caution or reserve, was lost. She screamed like
a madwoman, 'Adam! Adam!', tried to move and found that she could
not, beat on some stout manly chest: 'Let me go! Let me go! Let
me through! Can't you see? My boy . . . Adam! Adam!'</p>

<p>But it happened that a strong body of the new police had just
arrived from Scotland Yard that they might form themselves into a
line at the end of King Street to prevent the mob from proceeding
to the House of Commons. At once a great shout went up: 'The
Peelers!' 'The Peelers!' 'Down with the Peelers!' As though the
ground were agitated with earthquake, the crowd rocked forward
and back, seeming to rise in places like a bulging floor about to
crack. A line of wavering flame ran against the walls of the
houses where men with lighted wood were ranging themselves in a
line of defence. But Judith saw and heard nothing. Adam was lost,
Adam might be crushed underfoot, she would never see Adam again;
and at that frantic thought all the world that had seemed so
important, social, political, religious--yes, and all the
Herries, all Uldale, all her individual life and desires, blew
like scraps of burnt paper into the air. Her shawl was torn from
her, her wide-puffed sleeves rent. She beat on some face with her
hands, she tore some cheek with her nails. 'Let me go! Let me go!
Can't you see? My boy's gone!'</p>

<p>But no one saw and no one cared. A general fight was toward.
Inspector Lincoln of the E Division had arrived with seventy men.
The tri-coloured flag that had 'Reform' painted on it--the banner
of the riot--was captured by the Peelers. There was a rush to
recapture it. A man, bare-breasted, his shirt hanging in ribbons
from his back, black-haired, brawny, his chest tattooed with a
ship in violet and green, hung above the mob like a sign. He had
in his hand a hatchet. Judith, seeing him with a strange and
memorable distinctness, beheld him, as it seemed to her, trample
on her boy. The crowd rose and fell; she was swept off her feet
and would, it may be, have ended all her adventures there and
then for ever had not some man caught her to him so that she was
soaked, as it were, in his sweat and ale and dripping clothes,
her head against his beard, his hand upon her breast. A fine
thing for an old lady of fifty-six! But it saved her. Crushed,
with her face in his rough hair, seeing nothing, frantic for
Adam, she heard around her the strange sough and sigh of a mob
suddenly terrified, resolved to run, the wind beating from under
their feet, as though it would raise them to the sky. 'Reform!'
'Reform!' 'Reform!' 'The Peelers!' 'The Peelers!'</p>

<p>And then sudden quiet, a child crying, a whistle sharply
blown, and she herself, her cheek bleeding, was half sitting,
half crumpled on the pavement. But she was up in a moment. She
could run now; there was nothing to stop her. As though God had
crooked His little finger, there was no one there. Some man leant
against the railings moaning and nursing his head, a beaver hat
lay in the roadway, a burning faggot sent up a twist of smoke,
and the silence was like a miracle. A yard away there was Adam,
crying 'They're on the run! They're on the run! Mother, look,
look!'</p>

<p>He had never been more than a yard away, then. She was furious
with him and, her hair about her face, did what she had never
done before--slapped his face.</p>

<p>'You careless boy! You careless boy!'</p>

<p>But he was enchanted. It was the best adventure of his life so
far. His mouth was bleeding, his coat and trousers torn, but he
laughed and laughed as though he'd never have done.</p>

<p>Then she hugged and kissed him.</p>

<p>'I thought you were killed,' she said. She felt an old, old
woman, an ache in every bone and her head like a turnip. Very
characteristically, she recovered her dignity.</p>

<p>'Now we'll find a hackney coach,' she said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The watchman was calling up from the street below two o'clock
of the morning before Adam came in to wish her goodnight. She was
sitting up, a very old lady indeed she felt, propped up with
pillows and telling her different aches to mind their business
and behave. There was a bruise on her forehead, one knee was
lamentably swollen, but there was no real harm done . . . only
she was very old of a sudden. Nine hundred and ninety.</p>

<p>'Come here and kiss me,' she said.</p>

<p>Adam was in his nightdress, and, with a purple lump the size
of a lemon over one eye, looked no beauty.</p>

<p>He laughed and sat on the bed, her arm around him. She made
him put on her furred dressing-gown and furred slippers, for the
room was viciously cold. There was a warming-pan inside the bed
now, and she made him slide his feet inside against hers.</p>

<p>So he slipped into the circle of her arm, lay there with his
black hair in his eyes, too eagerly excited to sleep yet. The
panic of her fear that she had lost him was still with her. She
had never loved him with such passionate intensity and she had
never felt so old. Her brain formed odd confused pictures for
her, nothing tangible, nothing consecutive. In the big stone
fireplace a baby fire leapt as though it were trying its first
steps in life so that it might really be a fine grown-up fire one
day. An impenetrably black picture of a forest, a lonely tower,
and some horsemen swayed a little on its cord, blown by all the
draughts of heaven, some of whom whistled through the wallpaper
like lonely spirits trying to keep their courage up. Three
candles guttered on the table beside the four-poster with the
green hangings; a mirror topped with heavy gilt feathers
reflected the light. And under and above all this was the
dreadful cold, a cold worse than Arctic, for it was damp. Soon
Adam was lying inside the bed folded in his mother's arms as he
had not been since he was a tiny boy at Watendlath.</p>

<p>Without words they reached a loving intimate security that
daylight and Adam's dislike of manifestation had hindered at
Uldale. It had always been there, but for long now she had not
had his heart beating, as it were, inside her very body.</p>

<p>Idly she watched the pictures come and go: Stephen saying 'And
now let us pray'; Sylvia Herries imitating some ballet-dancer at
the Opera; young Mr Harrison Ainsworth (so handsome but wearing
too many rings and his curls too heavy with Macassar oil) telling
her about his recent Italian journey, and how he had found a
rouge-pot at Pompeii; gossip about Ball Hughes and the Bulwers
and Lady Blessington and Holland House--and then, over all this
nonsense, the figure of the man with the ship of violet on his
chest, raising his hatchet . . .</p>

<p>She held Adam closely to her, kissed him, stroked his
forehead. He did not resist nor move away as he would normally
have done, but sleepily murmured: 'Down with the Peelers!' 'Down
with Wellington!' 'Down with the Peelers!'</p>

<p>'Hush, dear. Don't think of the horrid thing. I wonder how
Amery and Sylvia are! Dear me! how incredibly selfish! I have
never thought of them until this instant!'</p>

<p>Then the dancing pictures vanished. She saw something else and
with extraordinary clearness. She raised herself on her pillows.
Adam tickled her foot with his.</p>

<p>'Adam, wake up! There is something that I must say!'</p>

<p>He took her hand in his.</p>

<p>'Adam--you will shortly be a grown man and I shall be an old
woman. I had not thought of it until this moment. How dreadful to
be old! And I shall not be a nice old woman. I shall want my way.
I made the mistake of my whole life when I stayed at Uldale. We
should have gone to Watendlath. I have become Herries and made
you Herries and shall wish you to be more and more Herries. Adam,
promise me that, however I wish it, you will keep your
independence. You are not to be Herries. You are illegitimate
anyway, and your father was so little Herries as not to matter. I
shall want to keep you later. You will be all I shall have. But
you are not to permit me. Do you hear? However much I love you .
. . Dear me, dear me, what a nasty old woman I am going to
be!'</p>

<p>Then, as there was no response, she said again:</p>

<p>'You are not to allow me to swallow you, do you understand?
Fight me, if need be. In another ten years I shall be completely
Herries, from head to toe. How horrible! Adam, do you hear
me.'</p>

<p>'What, Mama?'</p>

<p>'You are to keep your independence. I love you too much for it
to be good for either of us.'</p>

<p>'And when the Peelers were coming . . .' he murmured.</p>

<p>The vision passed. She saw nothing, but gathered him closer
into her arms, and he slept, holding her hand tightly in his,
while she gazed out into the room and watched the little fire
surrender its life, and the candles blow unsteadily in the
wind.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c107">WESTAWAYS: FATHER AND SON</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was not true to say that Walter Herries was without
imagination. He could see very vividly things that were not
actually in front of him, only they must, those things, if they
were going to act on him powerfully, <i>spring</i> from facts.
Then, his imagination once started, he could be obsessed,
obsessed by his own grandeur, by his sense of power, by the
thought that he was a Herries, and, above all, by the knowledge
that he was Uhland's father.</p>

<p>At this very time that Judith was in London breaking vases,
meeting Mr Disraeli, and scratching the cheeks of rioters, Walter
was taking his son Uhland day after day up the hill to Ireby to
watch the Fortress growing. Uhland was now fifteen years of age,
and the Fortress was half its way to heaven.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that it was not yet called the
Fortress--that name came to it later--but already it was
beginning to be grim of aspect. Mr Carstairs, bothered by
rheumatism and this cursed Northern climate, was not in the best
of tempers. And he was beginning to dislike Walter Herries
extremely. He had never been bullied before, being a man of some
personality and temper. Walter Herries often spoke to him as he
would to his groom, and Carstairs would have given the job up
long ago were it not that he was aware that the Herries were now
important people in London and a useful connexion, that Walter
threw money about, and (this the most important with Carstairs,
who was, finally, a man of feeling) that Walter could show, at
times, an extraordinary and even pathetic charm.</p>

<p>He wanted the place to look like a castle. It was to have
battlements and towers, towers from whose summit a flag could
fly. That was the moment of Romanticism, of the Waverley Novels,
of <i>Weltschmerz,</i> of <i>Pelham</i> and (a little late)
<i>Childe Harold</i> and <i>Werther.</i> There was no
<i>Weltschmerz</i> in Walter, but he would have his battlements
and a flag flying. So the place was going up, grim and grey and
forbidding. Its half-grown walls could already be seen from all
the country round.</p>

<p>Nearly every day Walter and Uhland rode up there, Walter on a
big white horse, Uhland on a small black pony. As you watched
them together (as Carstairs watched them) you might sometimes
think their positions reversed, that Uhland was the father and
Walter the son. There <i>was,</i> Carstairs decided again and
again, something most truly pathetic in their relationship, for
Walter dearly loved his son. It was the one true, selfless,
generous instinct in him. Selfless? That perhaps not, for an
intense family pride was at the root of it. But pride? Pride in
that queer, misshapen, white-faced ancient child, whose sharp
countenance was always grave, whose voice was so cold and
detached, whose chilly eyes watched you so solemnly, with so deep
and questioning a gaze. Only once had Carstairs seen the boy
moved by some human emotion, and that was when, by a chance,
having met young Adam in Keswick and had a chat with him, he had
said something about him to Walter. Young Uhland had been
listening; colour had crept into his cheeks, light into his eye.
Walter had made a scornful gesture, and it seemed that Uhland was
going to say something in protest. He checked himself.</p>

<p>It was, thought Carstairs, an interesting thing to see that
stout, red-faced man with his bright waistcoats, his pins and his
rings, his confidence and his pride, surrender to that colourless
child in his black suit, so silent, so neat and so watchful. Yes,
watchful! That was what Uhland was, watchful and waiting.
Meanwhile his sister Elizabeth, the prettiest child, Carstairs
thought, that he had ever seen, never shared her father's
company. It was as though he had no daughter.</p>

<p>That was a month of chills and mists, of sudden winds and
gleaming suns. One afternoon when the sun ran in and out of the
clouds like a jester, Walter and Uhland rode up to Ireby.</p>

<p>'Father,' said Uhland, 'why are you building this house?'</p>

<p>Why was he building this house? What a question! Nevertheless,
this was the first occasion on which Uhland had shown any
interest in the affair. Day after day they had ridden up there,
and Walter, in a flood of talk, had shown his son how this would
be there, and that here, that the ballroom would be so long, and
the dining-room catch the sun at such a time, that he should have
a room to himself, in one of the towers if he liked, so that he
could look over the whole country, over to Keswick, over to
Scotland . . .</p>

<p>And Uhland had watched him gravely and plucked at his upper
lip in a way that he had, but said no word.</p>

<p>'Why am I building this house?' Walter explained. 'For you, my
son, and for the glory of the family, so that when you marry, my
son . . .'</p>

<p>'I shall never marry,' said Uhland.</p>

<p>'Ah, you think that now, Uhland, but the time will come when
you will see a lady so beautiful . . .'</p>

<p>But Uhland shook his head.</p>

<p>'I don't care about women,' he said.</p>

<p>But, of course, he must marry. Did he not wish to carry on the
family?</p>

<p>He looked at his father sardonically. There were plenty of
people to do that--all the lot at Uldale, all his relations in
London.</p>

<p>Walter felt a chill at his heart. Of course, Uhland must have
sons, and they must have sons, and sons and sons!</p>

<p>'Look, Father--there is Mrs Herries!'</p>

<p>She was there again then, standing on the edge of the rough
bare field, her tall black figure framed by the rough bare hills.
A sensation of disgust caught him. He had not seen her for
several weeks and thought that she had at last wearied of this
crazy, imbecile watching. For crazy and imbecile she was! At
first he had been rather pleased at the sight of her. He was
having his revenge, although a revenge for what he by now would
have found it rather difficult to say. Jennifer and her children
had shrunk to rather poor game, although he hated the boy for his
health and good looks, while his own son . . .</p>

<p>'Why does she come here, Father, day after day?' Uhland
asked.</p>

<p>'She's mad,' Walter answered brusquely.</p>

<p>'But how mad? I thought mad people screamed and broke
things.'</p>

<p>'She shall scream well enough before I have finished with
her.' He felt vindictive today and would like to hurt someone.
And yet he was not by nature cruel. If things only went well with
him he could be as jolly and generous as anyone. But what was all
this, what his treasures in Westaways, his position in the
County, this new place of his, if Uhland were not to take
pleasure in them? His big body throbbed sometimes with a savage
desire to take his boy and squeeze him into some sort of life of
response and activity. Here was he doing so much, striving so
hard, and for what kind of return? He turned back on his horse
and, seeing that dark figure against the skyline, thought for a
moment of what it would be to have, indeed, John Herries for a
son. He hated that young Herries. Yes, he would drive them all to
perdition before he'd done.</p>

<p>He drew his horse closer to Uhland's pony and, speaking very
gently, he asked him:</p>

<p>'Will you not care, Uhland, to have a son to succeed to all
this when you are gone?'</p>

<p>'No, Father. Why should I?'</p>

<p>Walter sighed. 'If you cannot see that, I cannot make
you.'</p>

<p>Uhland, after a pause, said quietly:</p>

<p>'I should be glad to have a brother like Adam Paris.'</p>

<p>'Adam Paris?' Walter, in his impatience, made his horse rear.
'That boy! Why do you think of him so much? He cares nothing for
you.'</p>

<p>'I like him--just as I hate John Herries.' He looked about
him, then asked: 'Father, when you have built this, will John
Herries hate it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, my boy, he will.'</p>

<p>'Ah--then I am glad you are building it, Father.'</p>

<p>'Why do you hate young Herries so much? You scarcely see
him.'</p>

<p>Uhland considered it.</p>

<p>'Why do people hate one another, Father?'</p>

<p>'Because of something they have done, some injury or harm they
have done.'</p>

<p>'Well--that's the reason then.'</p>

<p>'But young Herries has never harmed you.'</p>

<p>'No. But I will harm <i>him</i>.'</p>

<p>An incomprehensible boy! But Walter had never been clever at
analysing other people and, in any case, his clear view of his
son would be fogged by his blinding absorbing love for him. He
did not know it, but he would never have cared for a strong
healthy son as he loved this weakling.</p>

<p>They arrived at the place. A great bustle was toward, men
moving with barrows and carts, climbing ladders, shouting,
hammering, cutting stone, filing and sawing. The house, half
raised, lifted blind eyes to the sky. It was built of Cumberland
stone, beautiful in its dim blues and greens and greys with here
a soft blush of rose, there a strand of gold, but the effect of
the whole was nevertheless grim and cold. It promised to be
strong; nothing, it seemed, would conquer it.</p>

<p>Walter climbed over into the interior and Uhland stood and
watched him. Within, on that misty day, everything was in a
half-light. The men, accustomed to his presence, went about their
work. Through a gap where a window would be, Walter could see the
sharp fall of the hill. There, in the cup of the ground, would be
Uldale. He savoured in his nostrils, for a moment, the especial
blend of rough soil, sharpened with the grey-stone of some
solitary farm blending with the bare outline of the rising hills
beyond, cold and bleak but strong and deeply true--that meeting
of strength and austerity and richness that is Cumberland's gift
to those who love her. He loved her as an animal loves its home.
But today he was restless and dissatisfied. He climbed his way
out again, and after a word or two to the foreman, rode down the
hill. He went a little ahead and Uhland, watching, as he always
did, for everything, saw something very strange. His father had
turned the corner by the little wood into the road that ran from
Uldale to Bassenthwaite. Out of the wood came two people: Walter
was already gathered into the dusk, but they saw Uhland, and he
saw them before they turned back into the wood again.</p>

<p>They were his sister Elizabeth and John Herries.</p>

<p>He rode on after his father.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Uhland's room at Westaways was as bare as a monastic cell. The
walls held no pictures; the only furniture was a bed, two chairs,
a bookcase, a washstand and a cupboard.</p>

<p>There was, however, more in this room than this stiff
furniture. There were the animals.</p>

<p>Uhland, since a very small child, had shown a strong interest
in any animal wounded, hurt or deformed. A very pretty little
picture might be elaborated of a pale-faced, limping little boy
sorry for hurt animals because he was himself hurt. But you could
not think of sentiment in connexion with Uhland--it froze at his
touch.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in this lonely world through which we pass, each
of us shadowed from the other, who knows or can truly discern the
instincts of the human mind? It was enough, in the case of
Uhland, that in a cold, undemonstrative fashion he cared for any
damaged animal that came his way. The animals, on their side,
appeared to recognize him as one of themselves. They never showed
him that especial attention given by animals to human beings who
are kind to them; sometimes, we may suspect, with a sense of
conventional duty. They showed Uhland just as much feeling as
they would to another animal. They did not trust him any more
than they would trust one another. Yes, he was one of
themselves.</p>

<p>At this particular time, there was in his bedroom a bright
parrot with pink feathers, in a gilt cage. His claw was bandaged.
Uhland had bought him of a sailor in Keswick. There was a dog,
mostly spaniel, in a basket. It wore, with an air of comic but
patient protest, a large yellow silk handkerchief over one eye.
Uhland had found it dying in a ditch near Threlkeld, minus an
eye, after suffering torture at the hands of some farm-children.
In another basket was a wild cat, minus a leg, that had been
caught in a trap on Cat Bells. This animal, black, with fierce
burning eyes, spent most of its time gathered on its haunches and
spitting, but it allowed Uhland to do what he wished with it.</p>

<p>In vain had Walter protested that it was unwholesome to keep
animals in the room where you slept. Uhland briefly stated that
he would see to it that they were clean, that he would trust no
one but himself to look after them. Walter submitted. If they
made the boy happy there they must remain. And Uhland saw to it
that they <i>were</i> clean. The room was spotless, with an odd,
dried, mummified scent of the cloistered cell about it. Its only
sign of life was the sudden chattering of the parrot, who would
gibber unintelligibly to himself and rattle the bars of his gilt
cage.</p>

<p>Today, coming in from his ride, Uhland squatted down on the
floor and examined the dog's eye. Very skilfully, and with
fingers that were strangely delicate, he undid the yellow silk
handkerchief, washed the angry red eye-socket, put some ointment
on a long tear above the right temple. The dog, a black spaniel
with a touch of sheepdog, waited calmly while this was done. When
it was over he lay down in his basket and licked his paws. Uhland
gave him some water, then squatted down beside him, staring in
front of him. There was a lamp on the chest of drawers near him
that gave an ivory patina to his pale cheek. The black cat
crouched in his basket and watched him with fiery eyes.</p>

<p>When he thought, he thought not like a little boy but like a
man for whom all illusions are over. He had never had any
illusions. He saw the things in front of him with cold clarity.
He was only a small boy, but he knew an intensity of controlled
feeling that was quite mature. He knew shame because he was not
as other boys, haughty pride because he was the son of his
father. His father was rich, powerful, had servants, horses,
lands. He would have respected and cared for his father more
deeply had his father cared for him less and showed less that he
cared. The only two human beings who entered at all at this time
into his emotions were Adam and John Herries. He loved the one
and hated the other. He hated John Herries because he had been
brought up from a baby to do so, because John was handsome and
strong, but chiefly because he was gentle and submissive. Anyone
who was submissive roused in him, child though he was, something
wild and savage. To be submissive when you were strong enough to
be otherwise, to bend your neck like a woman when you were hearty
enough to be a proper man! It was as though someone preferred to
be lame when he need not! He caught a sense perhaps also of
John's dislike and fear of himself. He <i>knew</i> that John
Herries was afraid of him, child though he was, and the contempt
he felt for fear was closely allied to hatred.</p>

<p>For these same reasons he had always loved and admired Adam
Paris. That stout, rough, untidy brown body with its
independence, freedom, absence of all sentiment, caught and held
for ever his admiration. Adam Paris did not care whether he,
Uhland Herries, lived or died, and so Uhland loved him.</p>

<p>As he squatted there on the floor his thoughts were dark. He
had guessed for a long while that his sister Elizabeth had some
secret. They had nothing at all in common, he and his sister. She
was afraid of him, and he thought her pretty but uninteresting.
But now--she and John Herries! Uhland knew as yet nothing about
the love of men and women, although the gossip of stable-boys and
farm-hands had long ago told him all that there was to learn
about the physical facts of conception and generation. The thing
did not interest him. In any case Elizabeth was only a child as
he himself was. But that John Herries should be on any kind of
terms with a member of his family, roused, slowly, steadily, all
his coldest anger. He looked like a little old brooding man as he
sat there on the hard floor in the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>On the very next afternoon, as it happened, Uhland encountered
John Herries.</p>

<p>Riding out on his pony (he was always happy when riding
because his deformity was not apparent) he met John Herries
walking alone on the road beyond Portinscale. John was strolling
along, thinking deeply, his hands behind his back. As he walked
his lips moved. He was very handsome in the dark-blue coat, fawn
pantaloons, a brown beaver hat. Uhland pulled up the pony.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, sir,' he said in his queer grave child's
voice.</p>

<p>John looked up and at once was seized with the chill of
apprehension and discomfort that always attacked him whenever
this boy was near him. He had been thinking of charming
things--of the faint pallor of the dried bracken against the
hill, of the fact that soon Aunt Judith and Adam would be back
from London, of a party that they had had at Uldale for his
sister when they had practised archery on the lawn--yes, and of
Elizabeth whom he loved with all his soul, and for whom he was
waiting until she should be old enough for marriage. And
then--this hobgoblin! To be afraid of a small boy on a fat pony!
But he was afraid.</p>

<p>Uhland did not get down from his pony. He simply said in his
clear chill voice:</p>

<p>'If I see you with my sister again, you shall be beaten by my
father's servants.'</p>

<p>John replied contemptuously:</p>

<p>'How is it you are out, young Uhland, without your
governess?'</p>

<p>But Uhland went on:</p>

<p>'I mean it. I saw you both at Ireby.'</p>

<p>John stood there looking at him. He was determined to conquer
this causeless apprehension. Gentle and courteous though he was,
he had a manly spirit; it was true, perhaps, that this child was
the only creature of the world of whom he was afraid. He might
even if he looked at him long enough pity him for his pale face,
his meagre body that could not keep itself straight even on a
pony. But he looked--and dropped his eyes. He was rooted there as
one is in a nightmare.</p>

<p>'Now look here, young man,' he said lightly, 'you keep to your
own business, which is firing paper bullets out of pop-guns, I
should think. This is a fine day; I'm walking for my health,
you're riding for yours. We go opposite ways.'</p>

<p>'Then you leave my sister alone,' Uhland repeated. 'Your
family and my family hate one another, and I'm glad they do. When
I'm a man I'll do you a hurt if I can.'</p>

<p>'When you're a man--' John laughed. 'That's a long way. Good
afternoon.'</p>

<p>He passed on, but he knew in his heart that it was all he
could do to prevent himself from running.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Uhland rode up the hill a little way and then back
to Westaways. He would have a word or two to say to Elizabeth. He
found her in her room sewing 'or some such nonsense'. He limped
in, sat on a corner of the sofa near to her, crossed his legs and
looked at her. He recognized, of course, that she was a beautiful
girl; he had all the Herries quality of perceiving things as they
were, and he saw her fairness and delicacy, so that every colour
from the pale shadowed gold of her hair to the warm pallor of her
neck and arms was in perfect harmony; he saw all this, her
fragility and strength, the gentleness of her eyes, the humour of
her mouth. He admired her as a valuable family possession, and
the thought that young Herries should be familiar with her
revolted him--but revolted him in his own quiet child's way.
Nevertheless, there is no one more determined than a child when
he <i>has</i> an obsession.</p>

<p>'I saw you and John Herries at Ireby,' he remarked.</p>

<p>They were twins, but to Elizabeth he had never seemed like a
relation at all. They had never done anything together, never
cared for the same things nor thought the same thoughts.
Elizabeth had many faults but they were not Uhland's. Her worst
fault just now perhaps was her almost sulky reserve. This was the
result of her father's ignoring of her. That had eaten deeply
into her. She would let either her father or Uhland torture her
to the last point of endurance and not utter a cry. She loved
John Herries, but he was a man and she was only a child. She met
him secretly, wrote to him and the rest chiefly because she knew
what her father and Uhland thought of him. It was therefore not
probable that Uhland would get anything from her now.</p>

<p>'Yes?' she said, continuing her sewing.</p>

<p>'You are never to speak to him again,' Uhland went on.</p>

<p>'Who said so?'</p>

<p>'I say so.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?' She looked at him, smiling. Then she bit off her
thread. 'I shall speak to exactly whom I please.'</p>

<p>'You shall not. If you do I shall tell your father.'</p>

<p>'Tell him, then.'</p>

<p>'He'll beat you.'</p>

<p>She smiled again. 'You don't think I care for that . . .
Uhland, what a baby you are!'</p>

<p>That stung him, but he showed no signs. He nursed his knee in
his hands, leaning forward and looking at her.</p>

<p>'Those people at Uldale are our enemies,' he said. 'They will
have to leave there and go somewhere else when father's house is
finished.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' she said.</p>

<p>'Father will send you away to school if he knows,' he went
on.</p>

<p>'I shall be glad to go away,' she answered. 'I am always
asking him to send me to school.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Uhland, getting up, 'if I see John Herries
talking to you again I shall shoot him.'</p>

<p>'Then you'll be hung,' she said, smiling.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it's Herries that will be hung,' he answered. Then he
limped away.</p>

<p>But he had no intention whatever of saying anything to his
father. He liked to keep his secrets.</p>

<p>Walter on his side was driven, after that little talk with his
son on Ireby, by a strange restlessness. What had the child meant
about never marrying? He <i>was</i>, of course, a child. He knew
nothing of women or marriage . . . but the thin echo of that
small cold voice, like the whistle of wind through the wallpaper,
frightened Walter. The boy was growing. He had now his own
thoughts and plans. Walter ought to know what these were. He
discovered with angry resentment that he knew almost nothing
about his son. The resentment may be said to have been directed
against the Deity, Who was not at that moment paying all the
attention to Walter Herries' affairs that He should do.</p>

<p>So Walter went in to say goodnight to his son. He was sitting
up in bed, propped against his pillows, reading, by the light of
a candle, a book. A dark cloth was over the parrot's cage, the
dog was curled up asleep, the cat sat blinking at the candle.</p>

<p>Uhland was reading <i>Ivanhoe.</i></p>

<p>'What a silly book, Papa!' he said. 'I am certain that people
never talked like that'</p>

<p>Walter placed his great bulk on the bed and put his arm round
his son. Under Uhland's nightdress there was a sharp rigid
spine-bone that seemed to protest against the caressing warmth of
Walter's hand.</p>

<p>'Why, not, my boy?' said Walter, who had never read
<i>Ivanhoe.</i> 'Sir Walter Scott is a very great man.'</p>

<p>'Have you ever read a book called <i>Frankenstein,</i>
Papa?'</p>

<p>'No, my boy.'</p>

<p>'That's better than this stuff. Frankenstein creates a Monster
and cannot escape it. There is too much fine writing,
however.'</p>

<p>Walter sighed. Although this room was so clean yet you were
oppressively conscious of the animals in it. Their very silence
was alarming. He drew Uhland closer to him and felt the hard
casing of ribs on that bony little body. He kissed him. Uhland
resigned himself. He knew so well, oh, so very, very well what
this was, this having his face pushed into the thick hot vast
territory of his father's waistcoat with its hard brass buttons.
Beneath his thin cheek his father's heart pounded like an
imprisoned thumping fist. If his hand slid down to the hard warm
expanse of his father's thigh it was as though he touched hot
steel. Moreover, he detested sentiment.</p>

<p>'Uhland,' said Walter, 'I was hearing this evening that they
are ordering fresh troops into Carlisle. There is fear of riots
over all this Reform.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>'Do you understand about Reform?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Papa.' Uhland allowed his hand to be held and
imprisoned in his father's. 'Parliament has chosen its members
from the wrong places--little places have many representatives
and big places have few. The people are not at all
represented.'</p>

<p>('Good God!' thought Walter. 'Who <i>is</i> this son of
mine?')</p>

<p>'Yes, Uhland,' he went on, rather heavily. 'The people want to
throw us out, my boy. They want the country to belong to
<i>them.</i> They're tired of seeing us have the best of
everything, and I don't blame 'em. All the same it would never do
if they had their way. Think what England would be like if the
working-man did what he liked with it. Imagine if you had Posset
in power in London instead of--well, instead of the Duke of
Wellington, for example.'</p>

<p>Uhland agreed that it would be ridiculous. But, he added,
interested:</p>

<p>'You see, Papa, there would be five Possets, not one
Posset.'</p>

<p>Walter asked him to explain.</p>

<p>'Well, in Keswick there are hundreds of men think they're as
good as Posset. But if it's you or the Duke of Wellington they
<i>know</i> they're not so good, so while you or the Duke of
Wellington rule there's only one of you, but if Posset were to
rule all the others would want to as well.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Walter after a pause, 'remember you're a Herries
and belong to the finest family in England.'</p>

<p>'Are we the finest family in England?'</p>

<p>'Most certainly we are.'</p>

<p>'Then they are fine at Uldale too?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he answered, laughing, 'so long as they go somewhere
else to live.'</p>

<p>Then Uhland asked a strange question.</p>

<p>'Papa--is it part of you what your great-grandfather was?'</p>

<p>'What <i>do</i> you mean?'</p>

<p>'Well--your great-grandfather was a wicked man and married a
gipsy, who was Adam Paris' grandmother. Are you and Adam and I
partly like we are because of what your great-grandfather
did?'</p>

<p>'I can't say . . . I suppose so . . . Something.'</p>

<p>'But we are so different.'</p>

<p>'Now you go to sleep, Uhland . . . Do you love your old
father?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>'You are all he has, you know. All he has in the world.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>'He would do anything for you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>

<p>The dog began to move restlessly in his sleep, and he snapped
his teeth at the flies of his dreams.</p>

<p>'I am sorry that you like to keep these animals in your room,
Uhland. It is not good for your health.'</p>

<p>Uhland threw <i>Ivanhoe</i> on to the floor; then he turned
over to sleep.</p>

<p>'Goodnight, Papa.'</p>

<p>'Goodnight, my boy.'</p>

<p>There was a pathos in the manner of Walter's exit: the heavy
man, brilliant in his claret-coloured coat and rich brown
pantaloons fitting tightly to his thighs, elaborately stepping
softly on his toes that he might not disturb his son. He had
blown out the candle. At the door he turned back to look. He
could see nothing, and the only sound in the room was the dog in
his dreams snapping at flies.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c108">ENTRY OF THE FORTRESS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He stood on the black edge of the rock and stretched his arms.
He could have shouted with joy, for today was the great day of
his life.</p>

<p>Near him, around him, subservient to him were many of the
Family. There were present his father, Sir William Herries, Bart;
his son Uhland; Sir James Herries, Bart, and the Venerable Rodney
Herries, his brother, Archdeacon of Polchester in Glebeshire;
Carey, Lord Rockage, and his wife Cecily and their son Roger;
Stephen Newmark and his wife Phyllis; Garth Herries, his wife
Sylvia, and Amery his brother; and, after these, more distant
cousins, cousins by marriage or anything you like, Cards and
Garlands and Golds and Ildens and Titchleys--only nobody from
Uldale.</p>

<p>It was April 2nd, 1832, and his house on Ireby was
triumphantly open.</p>

<p>It was six in the morning of the happiest day of Walter's
life. The day, which was to end with a grand dinner and a
magnificent ball to which the whole County had been invited, had
begun with a run with the Blencathra Pack, and now here they were
on the flanks of Helvellyn, so that the sun and the hills, the
whole world as God had made it, might see the mighty glories of
the Herries family and Walter Herries in particular.</p>

<p>Walter was as happy as a child. It was not conceit that he
felt; he had no small vanities because of what he had done.
Everything was inevitable. Because he was English and Herries and
Walter, therefore he was King of the North. No force of heaven or
earth could have helped it. No especial credit to himself that it
was so.</p>

<p>Everything was well. God had seen to it that the weather
should be right. There had been early in March a very heavy fall
of snow, then towards the end of the month ten days of the
loveliest possible weather, when the sun had burnt through a warm
rosy mist, the crocuses had flowered in the Keswick gardens, the
lambs gambolled in the meadows, the waters of Derwentwater,
Bassenthwaite and Thirlmere shone with a blue as deep as any
Italian lake, then colder again with a further snowfall on the
tops, and now, in this early-morning misty air, a blue cloudless
sky spread like a field of young violets above their heads.</p>

<p>As his eye covered the scene he saw that all the members of
his party were there. Those staying with him were of course
present, save only his mother and his wife, too delicate, poor
women, for such an expedition. But the others whom he had lodged
in Keswick and Bassenthwaite, in Braithwaite and Portinscale,
were there also, not one of them was missing. It was a grand
assemblage, headed by the great John Peel himself, whose tall
bony figure, clad in his grey rough garment that descended almost
to his knees, could be seen on a green knoll not far away.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a marvellous day: weather, scent and all would be
right. The morning was as still as though it held its breath for
very rapture. The hills in the distance were softly coloured in
every shade from the faintest mauve to that dark indigo that has
the bloom of the richest plums. On the rough ground below him he
could see the huntsman's scarlet coat (the huntsman alone was
permitted the scarlet), and near him the hounds, little white
dots, rose and fell like shining pebbles.</p>

<p>His heart was moved, so that there were tears in his eyes as
he caught a faint note of music. Then the music swells, running
like a living human voice through the still air. Somewhere hounds
have struck a 'drag'. The white pebbles draw together and all
move upwards towards him.</p>

<p>A tall gaunt shepherd at his side in his excitement catches
his arm and cries: 'Sista . . . Sista . . . Yonder, yonder he
goes!'</p>

<p>Then scream and scream again bursts the silence, echoing back
from valley and hill. The world that had been so still is broken
with movement and shouting and the stir of action. It is good. Oh
yes, it is very good indeed to be alive!</p>

<p>Walter had with him his father, Rodney the Archdeacon, Garth
Herries and Sylvia his wife, but he was at that moment conscious
of none of them. The hounds, in a kind of jolly frenzy, were
answering to the holloa, and he too now had to answer, for he
began to pound upwards, plunging into the boggy places, knocking
his stout legs against stones and boulders. The leaders have
struck the line, the hounds rush past Walter as though driven by
a wild windy flurry; the music of the horn, of the cries, sweet
and lovely, is all about him. He is himself crying 'Holloa!
Holloa! Away! Away!'</p>

<p>Then the hounds were hidden by a breast of the hill and he
paused, puffing a bit, blowing a trifle--for he was a big man and
this ground was no light stuff to cover.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he found that he had Rodney the Archdeacon at
his side, even clinging to his arm and blowing down his neck.</p>

<p>'Whoof! Whoof! Walter! Deary me! Deary me! . . . Most
exhausting! So early in the morning too! Whoof . . . Now tell me,
pray, my dear Walter, in this ridiculous hunting of yours there
were some quite small dogs with the huntsman . . .'</p>

<p>'Terriers! Terriers, my dear Rodney.'</p>

<p>'Really! Really! Is that so? Indeed!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes. We'd never get a fox out of his hole without
them--'</p>

<p>'Indeed! . . . Do you think we shall <i>see</i> a fox?'</p>

<p>'We did see one just now. Down below us. There they are! There
they are! Out on the brow. Come on, Rodney! Stir your hams. Now
we're off!'</p>

<p>He went pounding off and fell headlong into a lake of mist. He
was quite suddenly alone. No sound. No cry. The mist eddied and
whirled.</p>

<p>He stayed where he was and was conscious of a foreboding, as
though some whispering figure had crept close to his side. Why
was he, who a moment ago had been so happy and confident, now
helpless? A hand had been laid on his shoulder that he should
stop to hear some judgement. He looked about him, but he was
blind and, it seemed, deaf as well. How unforeseen a country this
was, always, when you least expected it, coming up to assert its
power over you. He did not put it like that, but he was like a
little boy, blundering unexpectedly into the dark. The mist clung
to him like thin lawn, then moved from him and faced him in a
wall of blankness, then eddied like smoke, creeping along the
ground, then pressed in upon him again filling his mouth and
nose. He stared, dumbfounded, as though he expected to hear a
voice . . .</p>

<p>It broke: a gap was there no bigger than a hand; a crag leapt
into air, shaped like a face, black as jet. The ground, brown and
then faintly green, came sliding from space, and then, in a
second of time, swimming in a wall of bright and airy colour, the
whole landscape was back again; the voices were there, calling,
shouting. Only a little above him was the huntsman's red coat and
the hounds in a broken sequence of white and brown and grey
silhouetted against the blue of the morning sky. He wiped his
face. 'Dammit!' he thought. 'It don't do to be alone here,' then
laughed and ran like a schoolboy again up the slope.</p>

<p>All the world was alive and so fresh and bright that he could
shout for joy. There is the sharp call of a raven; near him to
the left on the slopes of the Fell are the small bodies of the
Herdwick sheep--and there, just in front of him, can it really
be, is the fox himself!</p>

<p>He is running with a slouching, slinking movement, first
straight then with a jerk upwards again, stopping for an instant
by some borran where he might hide, thinking better of it, round
the crag, seen for an instant, running to higher ground, then
vanishing.</p>

<p>The sight of that fox fired Walter as though he had himself
created him. He began to pound upwards again. The hills rose with
him, leading him on. They were bathed now in crystalline light,
purer than the purest glass, alive with their own vibrant force,
stronger than any human life and far more confident of their
eternity. And then another miracle! For, reaching a higher slope,
he was above the mist that lay below him in a sea of white
shifting cloud while he himself trod on a firm sparkling floor of
brilliant snow. The snow carpeted the ground for a space,
glittering with points of fire, then the rock broke from it, hard
and black, only to surrender to higher fields of brightness.</p>

<p>He crossed the snow as though on wings, the sun and the air
lifting him, rounded a boulder and had the whole pack in view.
Now a dreadful fear possessed him that he would be too late for
the kill. He saw Garth and Sylvia swinging along not far from him
and he waved his arms crying, 'Come on! Come on! Holloa!
Holloa!'</p>

<p>Sylvia waved back to him and, great though the excitement of
the moment was, his natural instinct about women, hot and strong
in him, murmured: 'That's the loveliest female . . .'</p>

<p>His heart hammered as he leaped a low stone wall and found
himself on bracken and in the thick of the mob. They had shut the
fox away from an earth near by; you could just see him tracking
for the rocks. But the hounds have edged him lower and lower.</p>

<p>'Aye,' said a little purple-faced man to Walter. 'What he's
after is that borran yonder. The terriers'll have to be after him
from below. That's what he likes.'</p>

<p>The little purple-faced man was trembling with excitement. He
smelt oddly of bracken and snuff; he was a stranger to Walter,
who felt a sort of indignation that he <i>should</i> be a
stranger. Everyone today was a kind of dependant of the Herries
family. No one should exist who was not. The little purple-faced
man began frantically to run, and Walter ran with him. The fox
had gone to earth, into a borran where he was 'head on' to his
adversaries.</p>

<p>This was a big dog-fox and worth the fighting. The excitement
now was terrific: the ground seemed to quiver with it. The air
shuddered with shouts and cries and the snap-snapping of the
hounds. The terriers were mad to get at him; one small animal,
crazy with young pride and ambition, had struggled its way far
into the borran. Suddenly it emerged, looking foolish. All the
terriers stopped marking, and the hounds began to rush madly
round the borran, yelping, yowling, bellowing. The huntsman and
the whipper-in were cursing and swearing, and John Peel himself,
with his funny, ill-fitting long coat, could be heard muttering
his own particular Cumberland oaths. And this was where none of
the Herries were of any use at all. They hung on to the fringe of
the outside world--Will and Walter, Rodney and James, Garth and
Amery--all of no importance. They might just as well be dead.</p>

<p>For the fox had slipped away underground and bolted. He was
already at a considerable distance. The fear now was that he
would find a borran so deep that it would be impossible to get at
him or they would lose a terrier or two there. But no! He is out
again, and the hounds have steered him away from the rocks. The
hounds move now as though they have absolute command of the game
and are certain of the end of it. The fox is out; he is tracing a
thin trod through the bracken. The hounds, running from scent to
view, are hard upon him. A moment later, Mischief or Satan or
Hamilton has him by the throat; he vanishes beneath a flurry of
white and brown and swinging tails. Walter drew a deep sigh; he
stood, his legs planted wide, his chest out, burning satisfaction
in his eyes. That had been a great hour, and now he must recover
his dignity and gather his family about him again.</p>

<p>Rodney was at his elbow, but he did not want Rodney nor that
fat idiot James his brother. He despised them both, because when
he was short with them (as he often was) they took it like lambs.
He moved among the Herries cousins--those of them stout enough of
wind and strong enough of limb to achieve the 'kill'--with an air
of fine and genial patronage. He felt like a king and thought it
quite natural that they should feel that he was one. But the
members of the family who really attracted him were Garth, Amery,
and Sylvia. Amery, slender, stern-faced, grave, was the coming
'money' man of them all, already an important figure in the City,
and Garth was jolly, careless and handsome: young though he was,
he could drink anyone under the table and was ready for any
escapade or devilry. But Sylvia! Her eyes shining, her cheeks
rosy with health and excitement, framed by the hills and the
glassy blue of the morning sky, she was the loveliest thing he
had ever seen. She was ready, he was sure, for any gay adventure.
Harmless, of course; but tonight when the splendid house was
shining with light and colour, a laugh, a smile, a pressure of
the hand . . .</p>

<p>He moved towards them. Then he remembered Uhland. How could he
have forgotten him? The whole day was to be Uhland's! This day
had no meaning unless it were all for Uhland. He turned back and
began to search for his son on the faint green shadows of the
lower slopes . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Two Titchley cousins--old maids from Carlisle and so entirely
unimportant that nobody ever learnt their names from the
beginning to the end of the affair--sat on the corner of an
almost concealed sofa in the ballroom and considered the sight
presented to them. One was stout and one was thin; as no one ever
learnt their names that is as far as the historian can go. They
were dressed in the fashions of 1820, with high waists, drapery
of silk netting over their busts, their ball-dresses short, with
padded <i>rouleaux</i> at the bottom. One was in rose and the
other in mignonette-green. Their first cousin, an eminent doctor
in Carlisle, had brought them and, having brought them,
completely forgot them. However, they did not care; they had
rooms in Keswick but were determined not to return to them until
the festivities were entirely concluded. They were in a state of
ecstatic and almost drunken excitement and pleasure. A footman
brought them ices and orangeade. No one else spoke to them the
night long.</p>

<p>It was the loveliest sight they had ever beheld. They were at
first inclined to be shocked by the naked goddesses displayed in
the famous tapestries, they thought some of the costumes 'bare in
the extreme', they discovered a young man, quite drunk, behind
one of the gold curtains in a corner near to them, but soon as
the air grew more heated, the noise of the band in the gallery
more strident, they threw away convention and, their mouths a
little open, sipping their ices, surrendered to their
ecstasy.</p>

<p>Above their turbans of figured gauze, above the high ceiling
painted with the stars of heaven and naked cherubs hanging
garlands, climbed one of the two towers of the Fortress. In the
highest room of the tower (which by his own choice was Uhland's
room) a monkey with one eye and a face of the deepest melancholy
scratched his chest; a small terrier with a broken leg whined,
paused to listen, whined again; the parrot, under its green baize
covering, its head on its shoulder, slept a deep, philosophic
sleep. The moonlight soaked the room in a pale green light and,
very faintly, the sound of the fiddles, the bassoon and the drums
whispered in the air.</p>

<p>In the gardens everything was still and cold. Everything was
new--the stone walls, the steps, the fountain whose waters
flashed under the moon, the naked beds where the flowers would
soon be so splendid. The trees beyond the garden walls were old;
here daffodils were in bud, and the snowdrops dying. An owl
cried; the music, muffled but determined, drowned its cries. Then
from the heart of the trees a little wind rose and went whistling
and lamenting about the garden-beds and the paths as though
looking for its familiar friends who were gone. Beyond the high
road the landscape, falling to the valley, spreading to the smoky
hills, was soaked in moonlight and lay there as still as a
pattern on glass. A man from Ireby village walking out to meet
his sweetheart stayed for a moment in the road to listen to the
music, to stare at the blaze of lighted windows, then some sudden
apprehension--as though he feared that his girl would not be
there to meet him--hurried him on.</p>

<p>Around and about the lighted ballroom many of the rooms were
yet empty; some of them had ladders and pots of paint and
buckets. Here a chair lay on its face, there pictures were piled
against the wall; in one room workmen had left cheese and a hunk
of bread.</p>

<p>The ballroom blazed with colour like the page of an
illuminated missal. Agnes Herries sat with Christabel, Walter's
mother, on a little sofa, and everyone came and talked to them.
Agnes was feeling dreadfully ill; at her heart was a pain like a
hand clutching and unclutching. She did not know what to say to
Walter's mother, with whom she had never been familiar. She could
not say that she liked this new house, for she hated it; nor that
she was sorry to have left Westaways, for she had hated that too;
nor that she was glad that Walter was happy, because she was not
glad. The sight of so many people whom she did not know, whom she
feared, made her sick. She knew that her little shrivelled body
looked absurd in its gaudy ball-dress with the huge sleeves like
epaulettes. She knew that everyone despised her. Her only
happiness was to catch a glimpse once and again of her lovely
daughter Elizabeth, who in her dress of silver silk was, in her
mother's eyes, beautiful beyond compare. Once her son Uhland,
resting on an ebony cane that he now carried, came and spoke to
her. When he was gone Christabel said: 'What a clever face Uhland
has!'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is very clever.'</p>

<p>'I have never,' continued Christabel, who was longing for her
bed, 'seen so many of the family together in one room--never
since a Ball I once gave in London.'</p>

<p>She was no longer distressed by the memory of that eventful
Ball. It seemed to her now, on looking back, to have been a very
successful affair. She sought anxiously for Will, her husband.
Ah! there he was, talking to Amery Herries, a clever young man.
They would be talking about money, always Will's favourite topic.
Perhaps soon she might slip away to bed. Why, she wondered
sleepily, had her son chosen so poor a specimen as Agnes for his
wife? But her wonderings were never very active. She had long ago
learnt that it was wiser not to wonder about anything very
deeply.</p>

<p>The band broke into one of the newest valses. The floor swam
with colour, green and white, purple and rose. Laughter, music,
the movement of so many happy persons filled the air with a
golden haze; the owl's cry could not penetrate the thick walls of
Cumberland stone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was nearly midnight. At Uldale, John, Dorothy, Adam had all
gone to bed, but Judith sat in Jennifer's room looking after
Jennifer. Looking after Jennifer! An exasperating thing to do!
Jennifer had been ill for weeks, but they had had to set a guard
about her door to keep her in bed. She was there now, propped up
with pillows, her eyes shining like fireflies. Her face was as
white as dough. Even in her bed she looked dishevelled, her heavy
breasts exposed, her nightdress torn above her right elbow, her
lace nightcap tilted over one ear. She wanted to get up.</p>

<p>'You can't!' said Judith.</p>

<p>Judith was in a violently bad temper. All day she had ordered
the maids about as though they were dirt, rapping with her stick
on the floor. It had been all that she could do not to box
Dorothy's ears. They had all been on edge that day. Was it
because of the Ball at Ireby? Were they, in spite of themselves,
conscious of it? In any case, you did not know of what the
children were thinking. John had been melancholy for a while now,
and Adam--Adam was silently fighting her desires. Adam wanted to
get away and she knew it. She was determined to prevent it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jennifer was very ill. She had caught a chill
walking in the country lanes in a thin dress with black satin
shoes and silk mittens. Her heart also was bad. Her legs were
swollen. She was deaf in one ear.</p>

<p>'You are keeping me in bed against my will. I insist on
getting up.' She looked across the sheets with hatred at the
neat, pale-faced woman in the red morocco chair. She listened.
The house was as still as a bottomless well.</p>

<p>She poured out a torrent of mild, lazy abuse:</p>

<p>'Yes, you keep me here and think it very fine. You have grown
into a bully, Judith. That's what you are. Everyone knows it. You
are impossible with everyone . . . impossible . . . Why the maids
stay in the house I don't know. I insist that I get up.'</p>

<p>'Don't be foolish, Jennifer. It's past midnight. You must go
to sleep. I will give you your drops.'</p>

<p>'I don't wish for my drops. They are poisoning me. I expect
that Walter has bribed the doctor to put poison in them.'</p>

<p>'Don't be foolish. You know that he has done nothing of the
kind.'</p>

<p>'Oh, this woman!' thought Judith.</p>

<p>Jennifer slowly raised herself on her hands, climbed out of
the clothes and sat on the edge of the bed, her swollen legs
hanging heavily.</p>

<p>'So Walter has opened his house. All the countryside save
ourselves is dancing there tonight. The next thing he will build
a house just outside our garden.' She looked up with lazy
maliciousness. 'You may say what you like; he has poisoned all
our life here. John is not the same, you are not the same, Adam
is not the same.'</p>

<p>Judith said nothing. Jennifer went on:</p>

<p>'You love Adam more than anyone in the world, do you not?'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course I do. Jennifer, get back into bed. You will
catch your death--'</p>

<p>'Well, he is going to leave you. I can tell. I know. He will
soon be seventeen and is not of such a character as to remain in
a country place--'</p>

<p>A sharp pain, like the touch of a knife, struck Judith's
heart, but she got up and, very gently, went to the bed. She
patted Jennifer on the shoulder as though she were a child and
urged her back into bed again. Quite placidly Jennifer
obeyed.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear! I have such a pain in my chest! How they will be
dancing now on Ireby! Everyone from Keswick will be there!' She
sighed, a deep childish sigh. 'How still this house is! Only the
clocks . . . Judith, what do you think life is for?'</p>

<p>'What is it <i>for</i>?' Judith was listening. It was, of
course, only her imagination, but it seemed to her that she could
hear very faintly drums and fiddles and a dim bassoon. One did
fancy that one heard things in a quiet house at night.</p>

<p>'Yes. Why are we born? Why do we live? Why do you love Adam so
intensely when it is all for nothing?'</p>

<p>'It is not for nothing.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but of course it is. He will grow up and marry and forget
you just as I forgot my own mother and father. I should never
have left them. I should never have come North. I should never
have married Francis. My children don't care for me. No one cares
for me. You are all waiting for me to die.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Jennifer.'</p>

<p>'No, but it is not nonsense. I cannot understand it, all the
bother and the worry. People are born and they die, and other
people are born and it is all for nothing.'</p>

<p>'It is not for nothing,' Judith repeated. 'It is that we may
have some experience, that we may learn--'</p>

<p>'Yes, but learn what? I am sure that I have never learnt
anything except to be disappointed and to be afraid of
Walter.'</p>

<p>Judith, who was half asleep, struggled to comfort
Jennifer.</p>

<p>'You have learnt more than you know, my dear. There is
something immortal in us that must grow, and it grows with
experience.'</p>

<p>But did it? Did she mean what she said? Her love for Adam was
immortal. Her love for Georges was so--it would never die. There
was something to <i>fight</i> in life, something strong and
glorious . . .</p>

<p>She covered a yawn with her hand. 'Now, Jennifer, you must
sleep.'</p>

<p>Jennifer lay back in the bed. 'I have such a pain near my
heart. My throat is sore. I can see Walter come dancing down the
hill when I am buried. And then he will finish John and Dorothy
as he has finished me.'</p>

<p>There was something so truly pathetic in her voice; she was
like a small child who is suffering she does not know why. Judith
bent over the bed and smoothed her pillow. Jennifer caught her
hand.</p>

<p>'You are good to me, Judith, although I know that you wish
that I were dead.'</p>

<p>'Of course I don't wish that you were dead.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, you do. You have never forgiven me for preventing you
from living in Watendlath. Had you lived in Watendlath you would
not have wanted everything your own way so.'</p>

<p>This was so true that Judith felt as though it were her own
voice that was speaking. But she showed no signs: she stroked
Jennifer's hair.</p>

<p>'Judith, do you not hear something?'</p>

<p>'Hear what?'</p>

<p>'Music--violins and a drum.'</p>

<p>'No--of course not.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I do. Go to the window and pull back the
curtain.'</p>

<p>She went. She looked out.</p>

<p>'What do you see?'</p>

<p>'I see nothing. Only the trees and the moonlight.' But that
was not true. Quite clearly she could see in the far distance
Walter's house on Ireby. The windows shone like little stars.</p>

<p>'Can you not see the house?'</p>

<p>'Yes; very dimly.'</p>

<p>'Ah . . . Judith, Judith!' It was a cry. 'He will kill John as
he is killing me! I can see him. I can hear him. He is
coming!'</p>

<p>She hastened back to the bed.</p>

<p>Jennifer was very ill and the perspiration glistened on her
forehead. Her hand was at her heart.</p>

<p>'Oh, I am in such pain! Such terrible pain!'</p>

<p>'Quiet, dear. It will soon pass. I will fetch the drops--'</p>

<p>'Don't leave me . . . Oh! Oh! I am going to die! The room is
dark . . . Judith, where are you?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'Sir Roger' was over; some of the older people were departing,
Miss Pennyfeather among others. She greeted Walter with dignity
and thanked him for a very enjoyable evening. Indeed, she had had
one, and Mrs McCormick was to drive her back in her barouche. Mrs
Walter Herries had gone to bed; Miss Elizabeth, standing beside
her father, did the honours.</p>

<p>The old lady, who was feeling roguish, whispered in his
ear:</p>

<p>'You have a most beautiful daughter.'</p>

<p>And then, to be more roguish yet, whispered:</p>

<p>'But I miss Judith Paris. She is a great friend of mine, you
know.'</p>

<p>He agreed to both these propositions as perhaps he would have
agreed to anything tonight in his happiness and triumph. But he
was surprised at the loveliness of Elizabeth. He did not feel
that he was her father any more strongly than he had ever done,
but she <i>was</i> beautiful. And he would have been delighted
had Judith been there. He bore her no grudge. A little later
Sylvia Herries found herself beside Elizabeth and spoke to
her.</p>

<p>'Are you enjoying yourself, Elizabeth?'</p>

<p>The girl smiled shyly. She thought Sylvia Herries the
loveliest woman she had ever seen. She had heard that she was a
beauty in London and had a Salon attended by famous men, and yet
she looked little older than herself.</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' she said.</p>

<p>'Do you like the new house?'</p>

<p>She did not say that she hated it, that she was miserable
there, that she was afraid lest her mother should die and leave
her defenceless, but her colour rose in her cheeks and she
answered:</p>

<p>'I am not perhaps accustomed . . . Later on perhaps.'</p>

<p>The oddest feeling rose in Sylvia's breast. This child seemed
to rebuke her by her innocence and inexperience. Suddenly she
hated all her London life, with Rosina Bulwer storming angrily at
her overdressed husband, and young Mr Ainsworth such a coxcomb,
the tables after a party scattered with cards and overturned
glasses and the grease from candles.</p>

<p>She looked at Elizabeth with great affection. 'Be happy while
you may. You are so young and so beautiful.'</p>

<p>At that moment up came Walter, a little drunk. He took her
away. They were dancing the valse again. He asked her to dance.
He was not a bad performer for so big a man, but why had he not
even looked at his daughter? His breath smelt of wine, his heavy
body was pressed close to hers.</p>

<p>'This is a triumph for you, Cousin Walter,' she said. 'I have
never seen so many of our relations before.'</p>

<p>His arm tightened about her slender waist.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you a thing,' he said. 'I have been looking forward
to this day all my life.'</p>

<p>'The house is magnificent,' she said. But she did not think
so. She found it cold and bleak. There was too much grey stone
about it, and the towers and sham battlements were hideous. It
was like a fortress.</p>

<p>But he did not pay attention. He whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>'I'll tell you another thing. I think that I am in love with
you.'</p>

<p>This was no new thing to her. Men were for ever whispering it
in her ear; moreover, with his physical vitality, size and
strength there was something attractive . . . also tonight he was
like a boy in his happiness. So she did not answer him, but said
instead:</p>

<p>'The hunting this morning was the grandest adventure. I never
enjoyed anything so much in my life.'</p>

<p>His hand rested on her arm; truly he danced well for so big a
man.</p>

<p>'Yes, was it not? Glorious weather. And, do you know, this is
a strange country. I took a step and was blinded by mist with sun
all about me. For a moment I was lost.'</p>

<p>'Yes? Indeed?' She had not heard him. She saw that her husband
was watching them. She fancied that he did not care for Walter,
although he had not said so.</p>

<p>The valse was ended, and he led her away to an alcove near the
window where they were hidden by curtains, hidden from everyone
save the two Titchley cousins, whose eyes were more active than
ever.</p>

<p>She sat down, and he stood leaning over her chair, his hand
very near her lovely neck. To make conversation she said:</p>

<p>'Is it not comic, Cousin Walter, to see so many Herries
together? What do you think of us as a family?'</p>

<p>'What do I think? . . . Well, well . . . Sylvia, how lovely
you are! I am sure that I have never seen anyone so lovely.'</p>

<p>'I hate our family when it is together in big numbers. We are
all hard and material and self-seeking. When one of us is not he
is gored to death by the others, like a sick animal in a
herd.'</p>

<p>'Sylvia, would you make an objection if I kissed you? Only a
cousinly kiss, you know.'</p>

<p>'I should certainly object most strongly. I am married, you
know.'</p>

<p>'So am I,' he murmured laughing, and, bending forward, kissed
the back of her neck.</p>

<p>Her husband, Garth, had seen them dancing. Sylvia was right;
he did not like Walter; he wished that they had not come. He was
vaguely unhappy, a rare experience for his lively, careless
temperament, and, turning, found that Elizabeth, near to him at
that moment, was being left with many bows by her partner, a fat,
pursy little man.</p>

<p>'This is a grand sight,' he said. 'Who was your elderly
partner, Elizabeth?'</p>

<p>'A doctor from Keswick.'</p>

<p>'Are you very happy? You should be.'</p>

<p>Some restraint that she had been fighting all the evening
broke down. She liked Garth; he was gay and young and kind.</p>

<p>'No, Garth, I am not.' She held her head high, but he saw that
her eyes were bright with tears. They were away by themselves,
and he wanted to put his arm round her and protect her.</p>

<p>'Why not?' he asked her.</p>

<p>'Oh, this house--do you like it? It is hard and cold. And my
mother is ill. And--and--'</p>

<p>'You are in love?' he asked her quickly.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am,' she said softly. 'I have been ever since I was a
child.'</p>

<p>She was only a child now, he thought.</p>

<p>'Well--is there no hope of marrying?'</p>

<p>'None. A year ago we agreed that we would not meet any more.
It is quite, quite hopeless. But I love him the same and so I
always shall.'</p>

<p>'That is something,' he answered gravely. 'Fidelity. That is
very rare, and the best way to maintain it is never to meet.
Propinquity, my dear, kills love.'</p>

<p>'Why!' said Elizabeth, her eyes open and startled. 'Do you not
love your wife?'</p>

<p>'I can be jealous of her. I am proud of her. I wish to be near
her. Is that an answer to your question?'</p>

<p>'Oh!' whispered Elizabeth, staring at him and longing for John
Herries with such a desperate ache that she thought that everyone
must see it. Would you bring me some orangeade, cousin? I am
thirsty.'</p>

<p>The band struck up a quadrille. They moved to their places. It
was the climax of all the splendour and pageantry of the
evening.</p>

<p>'Oh, did you see--?' said one of the Titchleys to the
other.</p>

<p>Walter, his countenance shining with wine, health, exercise,
success, love and triumph, led Cecily Rockage to her place in the
dance.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Then the band struck up again and
all the coloured figures moved, softly, gracefully, about the
shining floor.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At Uldale, Judith, her arms about Jennifer, gazed around her
desperately for help. But no help could be forthcoming, for with
a sigh Jennifer bent her head and, falling forward, died against
Judith's breast.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c201">THE BATTLE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam, on the morning of his twenty-second birthday, rode alone
to Manesty Woods.</p>

<p>At breakfast, there had been the customary festivities. His
mother had given him a riding-whip mounted in silver, John had
given him Captain Marryat's <i>Mr Midshipman Easy,</i> Dorothy
had sent some silk handkerchiefs, and Rackstraw the <i>French
Revolution</i> of Thomas Carlyle. They had all been very kind.
Especially had the love shown him by his mother moved and
affected him. He had ridden over alone to Manesty that he might
think, that he might resolve his strong determination into
unchangeable fact.</p>

<p>He intended, before another twenty-four hours were past, to
tell his mother that he must leave Uldale and seek his fortune in
the world. It was a fierce resolve, one towards which it seemed
to him that his whole life had been tending. It needed some
girding of the loins! The scene with his mother would be
terrific!</p>

<p>In the quiet autumn weather he rode through Portinscale, up
the hill towards Braithwaite, then turned to the left, followed
the leaf-strewn paths until the woods closed about him and, tying
his horse to a tree, plunged down to the Lake's very edge.</p>

<p>There was breeze enough to run a slight murmuring ripple to
his feet: for the rest the silence was complete. Opposite him
Skiddaw rose like a dividing flower in purple shadow to a
shadowed sky. Shadow veiled the Lake. Fields, hills and houses
were dim.</p>

<p>He sat there, his hands pressed on his broad knees, and
thought things out. Yes, there would be a devil of a row! His
mother, as she now was, was not easy to oppose--and yet, if only
because he loved her, he must oppose her. He was twenty-two today
and, as he saw it, he had wasted five years of his life. For a
young man five years seem an immense time. Ever since, at the age
of fifteen, he had visited London with his mother he had resolved
to leave Uldale, and yet here he was--seven years later, and he
was still there!</p>

<p>It was not that he was not resolute enough! As he sat there
with his mouth set and his thick broad shoulders squared, he was
the very image of resolution, and yet his mother had been too
much for him!</p>

<p>He had begun, he remembered, five years back, when Walter
Herries had given his first Ball at Ireby and Aunt Jennifer had
died, his Grand Rebellion. He had said, his legs apart and his
hands in his pockets, that he was going. And his mother had
answered him: 'Well--go!'</p>

<p>But she had not intended for a moment that he should go. She
had used Roger Rackstraw and John to assist her. Adam was greatly
attached to Rackstraw in spite of his drinking, his wenching and
his gambling. Rackstraw had taught him everything that he
knew--how to ride, how to fight, how to read. It was from
Rackstraw that he had got more than from any other the love of
this country that he so deeply worshipped. Stones and clouds!
Clouds and stones! He looked up at the small vaporous clouds
browsing like sheep on the fields of misty sky above him. The
long white stone upon which he was sitting, the boulders that lay
about him, these were his intimate companions because Rackstraw
had introduced him to them. Yes, he owed Rackstraw a great deal,
and it was Rackstraw who had persuaded him that he must remain,
for a while at least, to help John with the property, the farm at
Uldale, the land towards Skiddaw, the business affairs in
Keswick. Well, he had remained. He loved John Herries very
dearly; there were things that he could do that John could not.
He was more easily friends with the farmers and the labourers and
the Keswick people. There was something in John, some reserve and
shyness, that kept him apart; he inherited that from his father.
But everyone liked Adam and trusted him, which was something in
these days of rick-burnings in the country and starvation in the
towns.</p>

<p>Then, two years ago, he had tried again.</p>

<p>'I am wasting my life here, Mother. I want to go to
London.'</p>

<p>This time she did not say 'Go!' She had looked at him as
though she would burst into a torrent of rage. She was by then
over sixty; her hair was white, but her small body was as taut
and erect as ever. Nevertheless, she was not quite as strong as
she had been. She sat down more frequently, would take his arm
when they walked in the garden. It was not so easy as it had been
the first time. Nevertheless, she had not said 'No'. Dorothy had
but just become engaged to a Mr Bellairs of Ryelands, near
Seascale. An excellent match. Bellairs was Dorothy's age, would
succeed to a fine estate, was a good, solid sound-bottomed
Englishman with no nonsense about him. So Adam must wait until
Dorothy was married. Dorothy <i>did</i> marry in June of 1836 and
had gone to Ryelands to live. Well, then, Judith was all alone
now with John. Of course, Adam must stay. Not that Judith minded
in the least being the only woman in the house. She adored it.
She had always had an affection for Dorothy, but of late the girl
had grown into a very common-sensible house-keeping woman and had
had ideas of the way that Fell House should be managed. She had
married, Adam was of the private opinion, in the very nick of
time.</p>

<p>So then it had gone on, and Adam could just see his mother
nodding her little head to herself, her mouth curved in a
triumphant smile. 'Now I've got him for ever! I shall marry John
off, and then the two of us will be alone here together.' (Adam
knew that she would never marry John off. There had ever been
only one woman for him. There would never be another.)</p>

<p>But there was more in it than this. There was Walter Herries
at Ireby.</p>

<p>Adam was extremely practical and saw things as they were. He
was not, as John was, frightened by unsubstantial fears. But he
could not deny that part of his resolve to run away to London was
founded on Walter and the house at Ireby.</p>

<p>After Jennifer Herries' death they--Judith, Adam, John and
Dorothy--had decided altogether to disregard dear Cousin Walter
and his big, ugly grey house. And so in a kind of way they had.
They never mentioned Walter except to joke about him, his growing
corpulency, his absurd airs and the rest. When Agnes his wife
died, Judith attended the funeral, and Walter spoke to her in a
very friendly manner.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, what Jennifer had prophesied was partly true.
The Fortress (as everyone in the countryside now called the
place) came ever nearer to Uldale. One reason of this was that Mr
Peach, Walter's agent, seemed to be on terms with all of the
Uldale dependants. Even old Bennett was seen chatting with him.
Mr Rackstraw drank and betted with him, and one night was
deposited, dead drunk, at Fell House gates with an ironic note in
Peach's handwriting.</p>

<p>Then Adam knew that John was always thinking of Elizabeth. He
did not, Adam believed, meet her any more nor correspond with
her, but John was certain that she was unhappy, in especial since
her mother's death, and the thought tortured him.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of Uhland Herries, his liking for
Adam, his hatred of John. For a while he was continually meeting
Adam, in the roads, in Keswick, by the Lake; until at last Adam
told him that he did not wish to speak to him nor have anything
to do with him, that his father was the enemy of all of them at
Uldale, and that, so long as it lasted, there could be no
intercourse between them. Uhland just stared at him out of his
strange grey eyes, nodded, and rode away. But John had the
fantastic, unreal notion that Uhland was always following him,
waiting for him round corners and so on, would one day do him a
hurt.</p>

<p>Finally, Adam believed it to be true that his mother was
slowly more and more conscious of Walter. When little things went
wrong she attributed it to Walter, just as Jennifer used to do.
Adam caught her sometimes standing in the garden, staring over at
the Fortress. Of course, she was becoming an old lady now, and
fancies would have more power over her than they used to do.</p>

<p>For Adam there was a growing atmosphere in the Uldale house
that seemed to him sickly and false. He must escape from it.</p>

<p>There was, however, much more behind his resolve than this. He
was determined to do something fine in the world.</p>

<p>Although his reticence hindered him from declaring his
thoughts to anyone, he was filled with idealism and love for his
fellow human beings. On this day, as he sat there, looking over
the shadowy Lake, he felt perhaps some of the sentiment that was
stirring in England just then. There was a new young Queen on the
throne; all the debauchery, mismanagement, selfishness of those
fat old men who had pretended to govern England had passed away.
With this child who already in a few months had shown strength
and honesty of purpose and purity of mind there was a new hope in
the land. Adam had pictures in his mind, as all Englishmen had
just then, of that girlish figure on horseback in the Park, or
advancing with perfect dignity and command to meet her Ministers,
so that all the old men who had known that other r&eacute;gime,
the Duke and Peel and Melbourne, were ready to kneel down and
worship her. Melbourne was already her slave. Might it not mean
that a New Age of Knight-Errantry and the Brotherhood of Man was
to begin?</p>

<p>If so, Adam meant to have his share in it. He was very young,
had had little experience of the world, but it seemed to him
then--as it was to seem to him all his life through--that a very
little was needed to make the earth a glorious place where
everyone loved his fellow-man and worked, unselfishly, for the
general good of mankind.</p>

<p>There was nothing selfish in his desires as he sat there that
morning. He never thought of himself at all. His heart swelled in
him as he formed pictures of life as it ought to be, as surely it
would be in time to come. It seemed to him that it would be a
fine thing if himself and others of a like mind were to band
together and work all with a common will for the good of the
world. He was proud of his family, although he himself was
illegitimate, but he was not proud of individual members of the
family. Something was always taking them in the wrong direction.
Even he perceived, in spite of his intense loyalty, that
something had happened to his mother. It might be that she had,
as she once told him, made the wrong decision when she had stayed
at Uldale instead of going to live at Watendlath. Then there were
Francis and Jennifer, John's father and mother, Walter and
Uhland, Will and Garth and Sylvia in London. He did not feel
himself better than any of them--there was never anyone with less
conceit--but it seemed that in life one was for ever being
tempted to take a wrong step: a quick decision and one was moving
down the wrong road, never again to be in the right one.</p>

<p>He felt life to be good; it could not hold such beauty as he
saw before him that morning and not be good. Yet so many things
were wrong with it--so much poverty, suffering of women and
children, dirt and shame and crime. Surely, if one worked hard
enough, and if enough people in the world cared for justice and
equality, everything would swing round--not to perfection,
perhaps, but to something in unison with this beauty, this sense
of God active and moving in men's hearts?</p>

<p>In any case, he meant to see what he could do; so he must go
out into the world, fight his way, find others of like mind with
himself. He got up, stretched his arms, felt an infinite strength
and hope in him. He hated this struggle with his mother. But, if
he was resolute, it would be sharp, brief, soon over, and then
she would see how right he was. He smiled as he looked about him
and untethered his horse. How lovely and perfect this place was!
Perhaps one day he would return and have a cottage here, with the
hills above him, and the Lake at his feet. Nothing the world
could hold would be so good as that would be! He rode home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But alas! How noble and ideal are we at one moment; how
peevish and unkind the next! Adam stopped in Portinscale for a
bottle of stout and some cold beef. There was nothing better than
to sit in the window of the Inn, drinking the stout and eating
the beef while the grey stillness of field and Lake bound with
the hedges of the cottage gardens spread like a fan before him,
to sit there and think of the world opening, of the great deeds
to be performed therein, of the fights to be fought, the weak to
be protected, the books, maybe, to be written! He had no thought
that he was a genius, but Keats (whose <i>Lamia</i> and <i>St
Agnes' Eve</i> Rackstraw had introduced to him) had not thought
himself one, and Mr Carlyle had been a peasant, and there was the
author of <i>Sketches by Boz . . .</i></p>

<p>So he rode slowly home through the mist and the yellow leaves,
dreaming of what was coming. What immediately came to him was the
Reverend Mr Bland, the new curate at Cockermouth, who had had a
London curacy and bore a letter from Stephen Newmark. A stout
wife was with him and a stout daughter. The visitors had been
asked whether they would take port or sherry, and the glasses,
biscuits and decanters were laid out on the table. The candles
shone (gas was not yet introduced into Fell House), a table near
by was ready with the round, lacquered Pope Joan board and the
mother-o'-pearl counters, for Judith adored Pope Joan. And she
sat there like a queen in a beautiful shawl with long fringes and
her snow-white hair in long ringlets, enjoying herself
tremendously.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr Bland stayed an eternity. He had endless
things to say about his new church, how the Psalms were read 'too
quick,' and the red cloth on the reading-desk was faded to a
dirty brown, and how at St Mary's in Islington . . . No, they
would never be gone, for Farmer Wilson had driven them over and
had gone on to some farms about some business of his own and . .
. Oh! there was Farmer Wilson at last, and soon the Bland family
was lifted into his cart, and the dusk closed down upon their
rumbling.</p>

<p>He followed her up to her room, watched her shake her curls,
change her shawl, do a little <i>pas seul</i> up and down her
floor in imitation of Mr Bland's mincing steps, laugh and sing a
note or two from 'Speed on, my mules, for Leila <i>waits</i> for
me,' which was one of the popular ballads of the day. It was very
difficult for him to attack her at such a moment, and yet he
could not wait. Although so thickly and sturdily built he was
nervous as a young girl when he confronted his mother. The memory
of that first awful quarrel following his laugh at old Bellenden
in Keswick never left him; there was, too, something dismaying in
her swift transition from mood to mood. Then she was sixty-three,
and, let her pretend as she might, was not as strong as she had
once been. And then--hardest of all--he loved her better than
anyone alive.</p>

<p>So he burst out at once that he might get it over quickly.</p>

<p>'Mother--I'm going to London. I've been thinking it over. I'm
going to earn my living like other men. I must, I must . . .'</p>

<p>Like other men! She stopped in her invocation of 'Leila',
stood there in the middle of the floor and laughed at him. Like
other men! To her he was still an infant, or at most a small boy
who stole jam from the cupboard and bought bull's-eyes at the
shop in the village. And yet he was not! She looked and saw him
standing there, stolid and square, in his man's blue coat with
the velvet collar and the strapped pantaloons, a lock of his
black hair falling over his forehead, whiskers sprouting on his
cheeks, his grave eyes confronting her without flinching. No, he
was not a child any longer. This was what Jennifer had foretold.
She reached out for her ivory cane that was leaning against the
four-poster.</p>

<p>'Not on your birthday, Adam,' she said, and moved towards the
door.</p>

<p>But he did not budge. He felt his knees shake, but now that he
had begun he would go through with it.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mother, I must.' He cleared his throat. 'Listen, Mother,
dear. I'm twenty-two today.'</p>

<p>'And what has that to do with it?'</p>

<p>'Everything. I am a man and should do a man's work.'</p>

<p>'You have a man's work here.'</p>

<p>'No, I have not. You know quite well that for all I do here I
might be shut up in a cupboard. John and Rackstraw can manage
everything.'</p>

<p>'That is not true. John is too dreamy, and Rackstraw drinks in
the village.' She felt that her legs were trembling, so with
great dignity she walked to the chair near the fireplace and sat
down.</p>

<p>The devil of it was that words never came easily to him! He
could think clearly enough, but when it came to words! . . . He
stood nearer to her.</p>

<p>'Mother, pray listen. I am not being rebellious or wicked. You
know how . . . how . . . devotedly I love you--'</p>

<p>'So devotedly that you want to break my heart,' she said.</p>

<p>(Something sarcastic in her said: 'Break my heart! My dear,
what stuff!')</p>

<p>He began to be angry, which was a help to him. When he was
angry his lower lip jutted out, a sign that she knew very
well.</p>

<p>'This is a resolve,' he said. 'Nothing shall turn me from
it.'</p>

<p>'Well--if it is a resolve--what will you live upon?'</p>

<p>'I have fifty pounds I've saved, thirty I got for those sheep
at Threlkeld, twenty Uncle Will sent me . . .'</p>

<p>'Fifty! Thirty! . . . Nonsense! . . . That will last you a
month or so. And then what?'</p>

<p>'I shall find work.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but what will you do? What will you do?' She stamped her
cane on the floor. 'You've been trained to nothing.'</p>

<p>'I can find work,' he said doggedly. (He thought of saying:
'Whose fault is it that I've not been trained?' but fortunately
kept it back.) 'I'm ready to do anything.'</p>

<p>'And starve in a gutter,' she answered contemptuously. Then
her voice softened. 'Now, Adam, this is folly. You <i>have</i>
work here, your proper work. John loves you. I am sure he would
not know what to do without you. You are necessary to all of us
here.'</p>

<p>As she softened so did he.</p>

<p>'We can soon test whether I'm necessary or no,' he said,
laughing. 'I will go to London for three months, and you shall
see how well you do. Why, mother, in a week you will have
forgotten all about me!'</p>

<p>She saw then that he meant to go. She bent her head for a
moment. She wanted to deal with this quietly, but she had less
control of herself now than the other day. Something leapt up
within her, crying, 'I want to get out!' and out it came,
disclosing itself as a nasty piece of temper that took herself by
surprise quite as much as anyone else. She had always had a hasty
temper, but now it was as though she had her own and someone
else's as well.</p>

<p>She was determined on two things: not to let him go and not to
be angry. So she got up and walked to the door; as she passed him
she laid her hand for a moment on his shoulder, smiled at him and
said:</p>

<p>'Now you must not be naughty, Adam. Some time--later on--you
shall go to London. Perhaps I shall come with you,' and left the
room. There for once her tactics were altogether wrong. Those
words, as it happened, were all that were needed to stiffen him.
She was still treating him like a child; she <i>would</i> not see
that he was a grown man. That just showed how hopeless everything
would be if he stayed.</p>

<p>But he must go at once. He could not endure that this
relationship with his mother should continue. She would beat him
down if she had time; her ruthlessness had all the old history of
their lives together to harden it.</p>

<p>Very soon, in fact, the battle was renewed. Next day at
breakfast alone with John, drinking beer and gobbling beef pie,
he told him his decision.</p>

<p>'John, I've got to go.'</p>

<p>'Got to go?' asked John.</p>

<p>'Yes, to London. I'm wasting my time here. You know that as
well as I do. I've got to be of some use in the world.'</p>

<p>'Well, aren't you being of use here?'</p>

<p>'No, nothing to matter. You see, John, there's a dreadful lot
of injustice everywhere. Look at these women in the factories and
the children in the mines. Look how people are starving. Why,
they say in Whitehaven--'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. But couldn't you improve things and stay here as
well? And is it your business? I mean--'</p>

<p>'You think I'm a bit of a prig,' said Adam. 'But I don't want
to consider myself at all. I may be a prig or not. I don't
care--' He broke off, laughing. 'Yes, I do care. I don't want to
be a prig. But I find it so difficult to say what I mean. What I
<i>mean</i> is that I think that a number of men are feeling that
they want to help to make England a grand place--without all this
injustice and division between the rich and the poor. And I want
to stand with them.'</p>

<p>'And you're on the side of the poor?' asked John.</p>

<p>'Of course I am. I haven't much myself, I'm illegitimate, I'm
nobody. Who should be on the side of the poor if I'm not? But I
don't want to preach, you know. There's none of the parson in me.
I only want that they should have more to eat and better homes,
that young children shouldn't go down the mines and be in the
dark all day--'</p>

<p>'I daresay they like it--being in the mines, I mean.'</p>

<p>'Like it! How can they like it? Would <i>you</i> like it?'</p>

<p>'No, but I'm not accustomed to it.'</p>

<p>Adam had been unusually eloquent, so now he was quiet again
although he had not, even now, said what was really in his heart.
John got up, came round to him and put his arm around him.</p>

<p>'I expect you're right,' he said. 'Only what it will be here
without you--'</p>

<p>'You need not disturb yourself,' said a sharp voice in the
doorway. 'Adam is <i>not</i> going to London.'</p>

<p>They both looked up, and there was 'Madame' in the doorway,
shaking on her cane with anger. 'No, I will not have it,' she
said, her voice quivering. 'You get this notion out of your head,
Adam, once and for all. Your duty is here. There's been enough of
this nonsense.' And she went.</p>

<p>The two looked at one another.</p>

<p>'By Caesar!' said John, 'I never knew she was there.'</p>

<p>Adam said in a low voice: 'It's no good. She can't stop me.
But it's awful fighting her.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said John. 'No one likes it. That's why she always has
her way.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Judith went about her household duties, and the
maids had a dreadful morning of it. She felt as though she were
fighting for her very life. If Adam left her, what remained? Oh
yes, of course she was fond of Uldale--but to be alone here with
John, the stupid neighbours, Walter on the hill . . . All the
morning she was closer to weeping than she had been for years.
This would not have happened had she done what she should have
done--gone to live in Watendlath with Adam. He would have become
a fanner and she would have lived with him.</p>

<p>She went up to her room. She stared out at Skiddaw, veiled now
by dirty, swollen clouds. What was she to do? How was she to
influence him? Behind her anger and indignation was admiration of
his obstinacy. She would have behaved once just as he was
behaving.</p>

<p>But she beat these thoughts back. No weakening on her part. If
she softened she was lost.</p>

<p>So that at dinner in the afternoon she was severe, aloof, the
grand lady, the Empress. And Adam, unfortunately, because of his
knowledge that he had that forenoon ridden into Keswick and drawn
his money from the bank, was not at his best.</p>

<p>If she knew that! But she did not know it. In her heart she
was quaking, but as the meal proceeded she became reassured
again. She addressed most of her remarks to Mr Rackstraw, who,
with his dry, red face and weather-beaten figure, seemed to
promise her that nothing here at least could change. Adam sat
there, eating and drinking as though this day were like any other
day. So it must be! She had been agitated by absurd alarms.</p>

<p>Once she said: 'The Hunt Ball in Carlisle is to be the
twenty-third of October. You and John, Adam, can have a bed at
the Witherings'. They will be going for sure.'</p>

<p>No one said anything.</p>

<p>'I have been hearing,' said Rackstraw, 'about this new postal
scheme. All our letters to cost us but a penny wherever we send
them. We live in modern times.'</p>

<p>She discussed the postal scheme and Lord de Ros' gambling
scandal. His manner of cheating at cards had been to have a
coughing fit under the table. And there had been the massacre in
New Zealand--one hundred and twenty people murdered--but really
so far away that one could not visualize it. She was
<i>almost</i> reassured; as she moved in a manner a little more
stately than usual from the room she gave Adam a quick look and
thought that she had never before found him so exasperating and
never loved him so dearly.</p>

<p>Adam told Rackstraw that same afternoon that he was going.
They were in the stables and it was growing dark. A storm of rain
was blowing up, and the light in the lantern that Rackstraw
carried flickered.</p>

<p>Rackstraw nodded his head.</p>

<p>'I knew you would,' he said.</p>

<p>'I must. I can't help myself,' said Adam.</p>

<p>'No, of course you cannot.'</p>

<p>'Care for my mother, Roger. This will hit her for the moment,
but she'll see it's right later.'</p>

<p>'Yes, she will,' said Rackstraw. 'She's a damnably sensible
woman, your mother.'</p>

<p>He shook Adam's hand as though he were going that moment.</p>

<p>'Good luck to you.' He fumbled in his deep pocket, pulled out
a little book and gave it to him. 'It's the <i>Iliad.</i>
Grandest book in the world. I always carry it with me. Think of
me sometimes.'</p>

<p>'But I'm not going now--' began Adam. Then stopped. He knew
suddenly that he was.</p>

<p>By suppertime he had made his plans. He would leave the next
day, drive one way or another to Manchester, then take the new
railway. The very thought of this railway made his heart beat.
Yes, he would certainly be seeing the world.</p>

<p>After supper he went out to the stables, wearing his
riding-coat and hat because the storm was so fierce. As soon as
he was indoors he heard his mother's voice calling him from
upstairs. He went up, his spirits heavy with foreboding. She was
sitting in her bedroom by the fire, wrapped in two fine cashmere
shawls and looking a very amiable and kindly old lady.</p>

<p>'That's well, Adam,' she said, smiling. 'Come and talk to your
old mother.'</p>

<p>No, she was not an old lady. She was as young as Eternity and
vigorous. So, in order that he might be entirely honest, he stood
by the door.</p>

<p>'I've been vexed all day by your nonsense,' she said. 'Very
foolish. Now sit beside me and I'll tell you what I've arranged.
You want more to do, my son. That's the trouble. Well, I've
thought of that farm at Crossways. I think, with a tightening or
two, it can be purchased--'</p>

<p>'No, Mother,' he said. 'It's no use. I'm as resolved as last
night. I must go and at once. Tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'And why tomorrow precisely?' she asked him, her voice
trembling.</p>

<p>'I cannot wait and have this trouble with you. I cannot endure
it. Anyone else--'</p>

<p>She got up. 'Never mind me,' she said. 'Don't be a hypocrite,
Adam.'</p>

<p>'I'm no hypocrite,' he answered fiercely. 'I'm your son.'</p>

<p>'You are not my son if you go,' she answered as fiercely as
he. 'If you go I disown you.'</p>

<p>'Now this is nonsense,' he fought back. 'Have you no ambition
for me? If I'd been another I should have gone to school and then
to some business--'</p>

<p>She came nearer to him.</p>

<p>'So you reproach me?'</p>

<p>'No, I do not reproach you. I cannot understand that you who
have so much strength of mind can never have had any ambition for
me. You--'</p>

<p>She came close to him.</p>

<p>'Take care, Adam, or I'll teach you!'</p>

<p>She was shaking, and that touched him so deeply that his voice
grew tender.</p>

<p>'Mother, listen. You <i>must</i> listen. You remember that
once when we were in London at the Newmarks', after the riot, I
was in bed with you. You told me then that if ever you threatened
my liberty I was to defy you. You said that this would happen.
You urged me then--'</p>

<p>But she had not listened to a single word. She caught hold of
him and began to shake him so furiously that she drove him back
against the door.</p>

<p>'Take off that hat and coat.'</p>

<p>He was now as angry as she. Anyone looking at them would have
seen well enough that they were mother and son.</p>

<p>'No, I will not.'</p>

<p>'Take off that hat and coat.' Her small body had in it an
extraordinary vigour.</p>

<p>'No.' He put out his hand to prevent her doing herself a hurt.
'You cannot use me like this. You shall not.'</p>

<p>'Oh, will I not?' Her words came in little passionate sobs.
'When I was a girl--we whipped our--disobedient sons--'</p>

<p>He tore himself away from her.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' she panted, 'if it is so--you shall remain
here--and consider it.'</p>

<p>She went out, pulling the door behind her with a bang that
echoed all over the house. He heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

<p>'By God! She's locked me in!' he heard a voice that did not
seem like his own exclaim aloud. He sat down on the bed, and the
room sank back into silence like a pool after a stone has
splashed it. He heard the rain beating on the window. He was more
angry than he had ever been in his life, and he did not care
whether his mother broke her heart or whether, indeed, the whole
world blew up. He looked at the window, went over to it, stared
out.</p>

<p>Here anyhow was a way out. He could walk to Penrith, get the
morning coach . . . Thank heaven, he had his money.</p>

<p>He climbed over the sill, felt the rain sweep against his
cheek, fumbling, found the water-pipe. It was the same water-pipe
that his mother, escaping years ago, had used.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c202">THE CHARTISTS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was while watching the return of the Procession from
Westminster--the Procession on June 27th, 1838, of the Coronation
of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria--that the life of Adam
Paris was changed. He had exactly thirty shillings in the world.
After arriving in London he had found a job reading to an old
blind gentleman in Bayswater, things like Pope's <i>Homer</i> and
Scott's <i>Lady of the Lake.</i> The old gentleman had died, and
Adam had found, after some weeks of starving, another job with
Fisher and Taylor, publishers of infidel writers like Paine. For
a time all was well, then Fisher took a dislike to him and
dismissed him. After that he sank to starvation. He had a room in
a lodging-house off the Strand, 'Wheeler's'. No one was ever to
know how lonely he was and how desperately homesick he was during
those months. He wrote to his mother once a month, giving an
address, but had no reply. He wrote to no one else; he was too
proud. He was sick and hungry for the smell of dry bracken and
the tune of running water, for the small bodies of his Herdwick
sheep and the little white farms . . . And, by the day of the
Procession, he was so hungry that he could think of nothing but
food. He scarcely saw the Procession. Afterwards he had a picture
of coloured fragments--horses tossing their heads, grand splashes
of crimson caught and lost again, pennons waving, spurs and
bridles jingling and glittering, cries and shouts: 'Here he is! .
. . That's the Duke! . . . That's Marshal Soult! . . . Who's that
little man? . . .' soldiers and again soldiers, backs erect,
heads up behind the tossing manes of their chargers, a blare of
music, a moment of deafening brass and thunder dying to a distant
melody, and the air still save for the clatter of hooves; then a
vague roar like a wind in the air, louder and louder, more and
more personal, then 'She's here! That's her! . . . Oh, how young
she looks!'--and, with an odd beating of the heart and mist at
the eyes, for a moment his hunger forgotten, he caught the face
and figure, tiny in the great gold coach, of a girl so young and
unprotected that there was something deeply appealing in the
risks that she was taking. Why, she was no more than a baby! She
was bowing to them. She smiled. She was gone. 'She's but a
child,' Adam murmured, turning away--then thought that, for the
first time in his life, he was going to faint. The street and the
people were spinning up to him. He lurched sideways and was held
in the arms of a tall, broad-shouldered, smiling fellow in a
plain, brown beaver hat and a black coat,</p>

<p>'What's up, friend?'</p>

<p>'I'm hungry,' said Adam simply. So the tall man in the brown
beaver hat took him home. This man was called Caesar Kraft and he
lived with his daughter Margaret in three rooms off the Seven
Dials. Kraft and Adam knew, within an hour of their first
meeting, that they had that deep emotional affection for one
another that men, often the manliest and strongest, sometimes
experience. There was a little room on the other side of the
passage from the Krafts that Adam hired. The Krafts were
Chartists, and within twenty-four hours Adam was a Chartist too.
By the spring of 1839, indeed, Adam was a more thorough and
convinced Chartist than Caesar Kraft himself.</p>

<p>On the morning following his first night with them he had had
a long and critical conversation with Kraft. He knew afterwards
that this conversation was one of the turning-points of his life.
It came at a time when he was exactly ready for it--growing from
boy into man, ignorant of the world, lonely and longing for
affection. As a child he had loved John Herries, but with that
exception, and of course his devotion to his mother, which was
part of himself, he had revealed his heart to no one. Now he
opened it to Kraft, for Kraft, too, needed a friend. Adam made no
mistake here. Caesar Kraft was the noblest, purest, most selfless
human being he was ever to know.</p>

<p>Their alliance formed, the rest followed.</p>

<p>'Do you think you can write?' Kraft asked him.</p>

<p>'I have no idea,' Adam answered.</p>

<p>'Remain here for a week and study some of these.'</p>

<p>Kraft put in front of him a mass of documents, pamphlets,
letters, appeals, protests, from every part of the country. It
was a very remarkable collection, and Adam devoured the whole of
it.</p>

<p>This is no place to go in detail into that documentary
evidence. It can be found in many volumes easy of access, but
some things are worth recording because of the effect that they
had upon Adam's life and outlook.</p>

<p>He knew that children in the mines, descending a shaft six
hundred feet deep, went along a subterranean road three miles in
length, and that at the 'workings' on either side of them the
hewers were employed in a state of complete nudity because of the
great heat. The child, sometimes not more than six years of age,
was employed there to keep the doors or 'traps' shut against the
flow of inflammable air. Here, then, the child would sit in the
dark all day opening and shutting those doors. At first he was
given a candle, but after a while when he was accustomed to the
dark the candle was taken away.</p>

<p>Later the child would be promoted to be a drawer or
'thrutcher' and then, clad only in a pair of trousers, a belt
round the waist, a chain attached to the belt at one end and the
truck at the other, the chain passing between his legs, often on
all-fours because of the lowness of the gallery, he would, hour
after hour, act his part as beast of burden. The 'thrutchers'
would push the truck along with their heads and, although they
were protected with a cap, were soon bald. The women 'thrutchers'
wore nothing but a pair of short trousers.</p>

<p>He learnt that a hedger in the country would receive
seven-pence a day for six days of the week to find him clothes,
food and lodging. He learnt that the soldiers in barracks had for
urinal wooden tubs, and in those same tubs they must afterwards
wash.</p>

<p>He learnt that in the Navy the sailors lived entirely on salt
beef, salt pork and maggoty biscuit, and that they would bet with
one another as to which piece of biscuit would, unaided, crawl
across a table faster than another. He learnt that a labourer
lived almost entirely on tea (often made of crusts or twigs) and
potatoes. For months together he would not taste meat. A young
man had been asked how he lived on half a crown a week. He
replied that he did not live on it. 'I poach,' he said, 'for it
is better to be hanged than to starve to death.'</p>

<p>Children did not go home to dinner because there was none. A
man, working in a factory, told this story: 'Up at five in the
morning to get to the factory, work till eight, half an hour for
breakfast, work till noon, dinner an hour, then work till four,
half an hour for tea, then work till nine. The master's strap,
six feet long, was kept at his right hand, two cuts at a stroke,
and every day some of it.'</p>

<p>The injuries of the bread-tax were beginning to be poignantly
felt. Bread was made from barley-meal. Families lived for days on
swede turnips, roasted, baked and boiled. A man had a wife and
six children to keep when flour was twelve shillings a bushel. To
have a red herring, to be shared by several, was a great treat.
If a father obtained a penny white loaf, his children would
trudge miles to meet him that they might see it the sooner. A man
would, in his hunger, eat the pig-pease and horse-beans that he
was threshing. The children would steal the cabbage-stalks and
swedes from the fields. Some families would go early out and eat
the snails. Bread was soon to be at one-and-sixpence the
loaf.</p>

<p>So it was in factory, mine and field, in small village and
large town.</p>

<p>Adam's nature, the more that it was so restrained, was deeply
stirred by suffering, but hitherto the suffering that he had
known had belonged to separate incidents and individual persons.
Now it seemed to him that the whole country was spread with a
cloud. It was hard to believe that there was anyone who was aware
and yet would do nothing about it. But it was so; not only were
there thousands who did not stir a finger, but he soon came to
realize that everyone who had any power in the country was
against any change. This girl who was Queen--he heard of nothing
but her rides in the Park with Melbourne, that she danced in her
Palace until two of the morning, that at her dinner parties the
plates were of gold and the cutlery of silver.</p>

<p>It was good for him that he fell under the influence of such
people as the Krafts or he might have become a violent agitator
like Henry Lunt, Kraft's friend. But Caesar and Margaret had
spent their lives among these questions. Their natures were sweet
and tolerant although they were as determined in the Cause as any
fanatic, and it may be said that they saved Adam at this
time.</p>

<p>One thing, however, did happen to him, and that was a
suspicion of his own family. He thought of Walter and Uhland at
Ireby, of Sylvia and her gay parties, of Will and his money, of
James and his greedy stomach, of the Newmarks and (as it appeared
to him now) their hypocrisy, of the Rockages and their snobbery,
even--in his new bitterness--of Dorothy and John. Uldale with its
farm, its ordered garden and orchard, its stables with the fat
horses, the lawn gleaming so smoothly under the morning sun--how
could they suffer it all so easily when men, their stomachs
empty, bled from the master's strap, when children of six years
old sat naked hour after hour, day after day, in the dark, when
women and children went into the fields and grubbed for
cabbage-stalks, when in the streets outside his window the stench
was so terrible that you fainted under it and fever was in every
house?</p>

<p>He began to have an obsession about the Herries. He saw them
with their horse-faces bending forward with malicious pleasure to
watch the sufferings of the crawling figures beneath them, Walter
guzzling, Will seated on his money-bags, Sylvia with her poodle
dancing across the shining floor of her boudoir. He thanked God
that he was illegitimate. He was another Herries rebel--the bull
that 'Rogue' Herries saw baited, Reuben's bear and the boy hanged
of his mother's youth, the falling Bastille with which Francis
killed his father--these were unknown to Adam, but he was forging
a new link in that strong chain of protest.</p>

<p>And then in the middle of this he received a letter from his
mother, the first that he had had since he had left Uldale.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MY DEAR ADAM--You have been very good in writing to me with
such regularity. Do not think that I have not appreciated your
letters but I was <i>determined</i> that I would not
<i>weakly</i> submit to your self-will and <i>obstinacy.</i>
Nevertheless, for a long time now I have known that you were
right to do as you did and I was too <i>obstinate</i> myself to
confess to my mistake. You have doubtless heard from Mr Rackstraw
who tells me that he has written to you and you have all the
<i>news</i> but now that I have broken the <i>ice</i> I must
further tell you that I am <i>longing</i> to see you again and
that there is no day since your departure that I have not been of
the same <i>mind.</i> I am growing an old woman now, Adam. I am
sixty-five years of age although I must say I am extremely
<i>vigorous</i> and save for a stiffness in my right arm which
only comes out in damp weather I am in excellent health. All are
well here. John has bought two more cows. We have been very
<i>gay</i> these last weeks and Dorothy with her boy and little
girl has been staying this fortnight with us. Veronica (a most
<i>foolish</i> name in my opinion) is a very <i>engaging</i> baby
and Timothy a good child when <i>managed.</i> Dorothy has much
common-sense but is anxious to have the command, even here at
Uldale, which of course, as you can suppose, I do not
<i>allow.</i> John is not so cheerful as I would wish. He had an
encounter with Peach, Walter's man, last week up at Bogshaw and
they came I fancy to some hot words. I have of course seen
nothing of the people at Ireby but I hear that Walter refuses to
have Elizabeth's name mentioned since her disappearance, of which
of course you've heard. Poor child! No one seems to <i>care</i>
what has happened to her. It would not have been so if Agnes were
still living.</p>

<p>I will not write more now because you are a <i>disobedient</i>
son and do not deserve a long letter but I am nevertheless
(<i>longing</i> to see you soon)--Your loving mother,</p>

<p>JUDITH PARIS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam's first impulse after reading this letter was to go at
once North, by coach, railway, or any other means that offered.
This was no new impulse. Scarcely a day of the last six months
that he had not known it, but he had always driven it back as a
weakness that he must not feel. But now with the letter in his
hands his love for his mother was for a while overwhelming.
Behind the words he saw her pride, her obstinacy, her sweetness,
her humour, her gaiety, her tenderness. It was as though she were
with him in the room. He realized, once again, that they were
part of one another, bone of bone and flesh of flesh. But for
that very reason he would not leave the work to which he had set
his hand. If he returned to her even for a day her influence over
him would be so strong that she might persuade him to remain with
her. He <i>must</i> be himself, develop his own life, create his
own pattern. In the end that is what she would wish him to
do.</p>

<p>So he sat down and wrote her the most loving letter he had
ever penned and then turned to his work again.</p>

<p>They had soon discovered that he could write. He was, in fact,
just what they needed, for he was honest, indignant and accurate.
His youth gave his words freshness and his sincerity prevented
any fustian or melodrama.</p>

<p>The fanatics--one of the wildest was this man called Henry
Lunt--complained that he was not strong enough. They soon
discovered that he was of no use at all as a speaker. He had no
power over words, and the sight of an audience was appalling to
him.</p>

<p>He went on one occasion with a number of delegates from London
to Manchester and they put him on the platform. It was one of the
most horrible experiences of his life. He stood there, his brown
healthy cheeks pale, fumbling his hair with his hand, moving his
thick legs as though he would kick the place down. He stammered,
stopped, stammered again, strung some sentences together and sat
down, a lamentable failure.</p>

<p>When he came back to London he told Margaret about it.</p>

<p>'I felt as though they stripped my clothes off my back.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, 'they say it was the worst speech ever made
in Manchester.'</p>

<p>'They'll never ask me to do it again--that's one good
thing.'</p>

<p>'But you can write about the bread-tax and the shilling loaf
and the fever here in Seven Dials,' she answered, 'better than
anyone we've had since Tom Colman.'</p>

<p>She was standing near to him, and he put out his hand, resting
it on her shoulder. She did not move away.</p>

<p>'Margaret, how old are you?' he asked her.</p>

<p>'Let me see. I was born in February 1820. This is March 1839.
I am nineteen.'</p>

<p>'You are not like a girl,' he said, his hand holding her arm
more strongly. 'You are a woman.'</p>

<p>'I have been a woman ever since mother died. That night when
she went and father was in my arms I thought he would die too. I
never knew two people love one another as he and mother did. I
grew up that night.'</p>

<p>'It was a happy thing for me that afternoon when Caesar spoke
to me.'</p>

<p>'It was a happy thing for us too,' she answered.</p>

<p>That night in bed he knew that he loved Margaret. He had loved
her, he perceived, since the first moment that he saw her. She
was the first woman he had ever cared for, and this excitement
and tenderness was quite new to him. He lay there thinking of
her, of her unselfishness, honesty and integrity. But he realized
that he knew nothing about her feeling for himself. She was as
quiet as he was; he had never seen her show any interest in men,
but they were not very much together. She was out at her
dressmaking all day and was often kept to very late hours. She
might have a lover somewhere. There might be another side to her,
a side that she never showed at home. He was extremely ignorant
about women. Although he was approaching twenty-four years of age
he had never kissed any woman save his mother, Jennifer and
Dorothy. With the exception of his mother his deepest feelings of
affection and loyalty had been roused by men--John, Rackstraw,
Caesar Kraft. So this feeling for Margaret was something quite
new, and that night, as he lay awake, listening to the drunken
shouts in the street below, it grew and grew until he felt that
he had Margaret in his arms. That seemed to him the happiest
wonder, something that awed him with its mingling of worship and
desire; lost in this new experience he fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was as cautious and careful in this as in everything else.
His shyness made him shrink from any rebuff. He had nothing to
offer her, no position, no prospects. And here for the first time
his illegitimacy troubled him. Kraft perhaps would not want his
daughter to marry a bastard. He was proud of his family, talked
of his German grandfather as though he had been the grandest man
in Germany. But when that seed of love is sown in a nature like
Adam's nothing can hinder it.</p>

<p>But this new desire made life difficult for him. He was pulled
in two quite opposite directions: his love for Margaret as the
days went by filled itself increasingly with light and colour
like a glass ball that becomes with every hour more radiant. But
his discontent with the sickness and starvation all round him was
something fierce and hostile, dark, jagged like lightning.</p>

<p>He remembered that once at home when he was on his favourite
place at the bottom of Cat Bells, in Manesty, by the Lake a wind
had come up, the sky had been darkened with hot saffron-edged
clouds. All in a moment the breeze had lifted, and the Lake that
had been placidly blue was edged with little frothy white waves.
The whole expanse of water was mulberry-coloured and the islands
were black-green, the tint of leaves turned backwards by the
wind. Behind this angry scene Skiddaw and Blencathra and the
fields below them rose drenched in light and sun--a wall of sun
flashing and sparkling. As the Lake was dyed ever deeper and
deeper with its mulberry stain and the little waves jumped with
tongues of a dead white, the wall of light seemed to exult in its
own glory: it shouted its strength aloud. Then, as a shutter
closes, a hand swept wiping out all colour. Hills and lake
together were dun.</p>

<p>He had never forgotten this scene. He had thought of it often
in his first homesick days in London; now his experience seemed
to be thus mixed--an exulting wall of light, a tossing
discontented floor of stain. For the first time he was touching
forces very much stronger and deeper than himself.</p>

<p>Then one of the great evenings of his life came. He went with
Caesar Kraft and Margaret to a Chartist meeting in Seven Dials.
Lunt and another, Philip Pider, were with them. Lunt was worked
up to more than his customary indignation because a family living
in the cellar of his building had been sick of the fever: two of
them, an old man and a child, had died, and their bodies had been
left there in the cellar two days and a night before anyone
attended them. Adam noticed that behind his indignation was a
kind of fierce joy because he had been given some more evidence
to use in his damning account against all authority. He described
with angry gusto the filthy state of that cellar, the pools of
moisture, the loathsome stench, the rats.</p>

<p>He was this night like an animal himself, his strong dark
hairy body moving like an animal's, his words, growls, mutters,
little snatches of ferocity. The surroundings that evening were
strange and fantastic. There had been a thick yellow fog all day,
but now it had thinned, hanging in discontented wisps about the
streets and buildings. The lamps in the street were damp and
mildewed with moisture; the shops were for the most part closed,
but some were yet open and you could see, in the candlelight,
figures like shapes in the fire cross-legged over a boot or shoe,
arms raised to fetch down some garment, a butcher standing with
blood on his apron above slabs of red meat and dark
amber-coloured entrails. Everyone moved through the wispy fog as
though in secret, and there was that faint scent of sulphur in
the air that a thick London fog leaves behind it.</p>

<p>For Adam that walk to the hall where the meeting was to be
held was one of his most blissful moments. Margaret's hand was
through his arm; he could feel the soft swell of her breast
against his sleeve, she was so close to him. She spoke in a voice
that was quiet and happy. He knew that she was happy, he could
feel it in every word that she spoke. Once and again he could
catch under her bonnet the gleam of her eyes, the shadow of her
cheek above her dark green shawl. He was terribly anxious not to
cheat himself (all this experience was so new to him), but he
began to believe that his company must have something to do with
her happiness--and then quite suddenly she told him that it was
so.</p>

<p>'You know, Adam, since you came to us father and I have been
happier than we used to be.'</p>

<p>His heart hammered with delight. He thought that she must feel
its beatings against her arm. And as always when he was deeply
moved, he could say nothing.</p>

<p>'Um--' he muttered.</p>

<p>'Are you not glad?'</p>

<p>'Of course, I am glad--if it's true, Margaret.'</p>

<p>'But, of course, it's true. Why should I say it if it was not?
Father was often very lonely before you came. He can be
passionate in his affections, and I think he loves you more than
he ever loved anyone except mother.'</p>

<p>'And yourself?'</p>

<p>'Oh, myself--I am always there, you know. He has become
accustomed to me.'</p>

<p>He plucked up his courage, although his tongue was dry in his
throat.</p>

<p>'And some day you will marry, Margaret?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered quietly. 'I hope so--some day.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps there is someone--already--'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know,' she answered, laughing. 'There is Mr
Hooper--a friend of Madame's at the shop . . .'</p>

<p>'Oh, is there?' he said, his heart dropping to a dreadful
deadness.</p>

<p>'I think he likes me,' she went on quietly. 'He wears two
waistcoats and I am certain he has a corset. He speaks like this:
"Oh, Miss Kraft . . . I'm sure . . . most exquisite . . . Pray,
turn that I may see the back. I'm quite in raptures!"' She
imitated him and burst out laughing. '<i>I</i> like him, but I
fear father would not. But he has a fine little villa in
Islington, and he sings to his own accompaniment on the
pianoforte.'</p>

<p>He supposed that she was teasing him, but he could not be
sure. Now they had arrived at the hall, and the other world of
fire and tumult drove down upon them.</p>

<p>The hall was a large one, and when they entered they found it
packed with people. The air was thick with the warm smell of
human bodies, the odour from the oil lamps; figures were
indistinct--here a face, there an arm, a body flung
forward--everywhere an almost ecstatic excitement and attention.
Kraft, Lunt and Pider went to sit on the platform, Adam and
Margaret were pressed into the wall near the door. Adam had been
to many meetings by now, but thought that he had never seen such
eye-strained faces, men and women and some children, one baby
held aloft and waving its chubby fists in the air.</p>

<p>It had just begun when they entered. The Chairman, a round
tubby man with thick grey side-whiskers, was speaking. The
atmosphere was at present quiet and controlled. He said something
about the conditions of the time, the oppression of the
authorities, the iniquities of the Bread Tax, the Six Points of
the new Charter. He sat down, and a long thin fellow with a
straggly beard got up. He had a rather weak, piping voice and no
very impressive manner: he began quietly, so there were voices
from the hall; 'Speak up! We can't hear!' and a rough growl from
someone: 'Sit down, damn ye, if yer can't talk.'</p>

<p>That last seemed to rouse him, for he raised his rather pale,
watery eyes and stared down into the hall: 'If you listen you'll
'ear all right,' he said at last. 'I ain't 'ad food in my belly
for the last six months, what yer can call food.' They listened.
He had control over them. He had come, he said, to tell them what
it was like now to work on the land. 'We're slaves to the
farmer's body, slaves like they were in the old Roman times. For
ten years I served Farmer Wellin in my county--aye, you don't
know 'is name likely, but one name does as well as another. Then
one fine day he tells me he ain't no more work for me nor my two
boys--so then I goes here, I goes there. No work. Then I goes to
Manchester, starves there a bit, comes 'ome again, put in the
Union, turned out after a day or two, lays abed a bit, gets a
day's work, then on board-day goes to them again, gets a day's
work, starves a bit, lays abed a bit, goes searching for work
again, eats stuff they've given the pigs because I'm that 'ungry.
My boys, as good lads as ever you see, 'anging around gets into
bad ways, one of 'em roots up a turnip or two and gets gaoled.
'Is mother breaks 'er 'eart and dies of weakness. That's why I'm
not speaking so 'earty, begging your pardon, friends.</p>

<p>'I say a poor man's a slave. He can't leave his own
parish--for why?--because in a foreign parish they've plenty of
their own to give work to. And what are our masters doing?
They're wasting of the land, that's what I say they're doing.
Give me an acre of land and I'll live well and decent on it
<i>and</i> give my boys a proper life. I was out of work last
spring from Christmas to barley-sowing. I goes to the farmer and
asks for a scrap of land to grow potatoes on. "Oh no, you don't,"
says he. "Give you potatoes and you'll want straw and a pig and I
don't know what all. And one day, maybe, I'll be wanting you to
work for myself," he says. "Oh yes," he says, "prices be so low I
must lower your wages," he says, but when prices goes up does he
raise the wages again? Not if he knows of it. What I say is, if
the loaf's cheap we're ruined, but if the loaf's dear we're
starved. For myself I'm ready enough to die, but my boys . .
.'</p>

<p>His piping voice suddenly stopped. He wiped his eyes with the
back of his hand. Then he went on:</p>

<p>'The farmers say they can't live without they make four
rents--one for stock, one for rent, one for labour, one for
theirselves. Times is bad and they can't make their four rents.
Well, does the landlord as does nothing give up his rent? Of
course not. Then corn falls two pound a load and worse--farmer's
forty shilling out o' pocket on every load of wheat--eight
shilling on every acre of his land on a four-course shift.
Where's that to come from? He can't stint the landlord so he
stints the labourer. Tell the landlord, friends, what you think
of him and do justice to your fellow-men.'</p>

<p>He stopped, his voice ending in a funny little whistle, and he
sat down, his legs almost giving way beneath him. The majority of
the men and women in the hall had for the most part never seen a
green field in their lives--the facts and figures meant nothing
to them--but the sincerity and urgency of his starved and feeble
body stirred and moved them. You could feel it run through the
hall like a message. There was a murmur, a restlessness, voices
cried out. They were all brothers together, in field and factory,
street and mine. Adam could see the faces around him change from
a vague listening absorption to a personal human activity. A
little man like a terrier leaped to his feet. He was plainly a
practised orator. He brought the personal case of the labourer
into the more general cause of them all. A woman broke out from
the centre of the hall:</p>

<p>'They would part me from my children!' she cried in a shrill,
agonized wail. 'How did I leave them this morning? Crying for
their breakfasts. I've had no bread to give them for the last
month and more. I've no bread. I've no fire. How can I have with
one shilling and sixpence a hundred for coals? If I snatch a bit
of wood from a hedge they'll gaol me. It's the women and children
you should be thinking on! Oh, if I was a man I know what I'd be
doing! I know what I'd be doing!'</p>

<p>Another woman, on that, cried out, waving an arm hysterically:
'Ax the Queen. Go and ax the Queen to come and see for herself.
She's got a heart same as us . . .' And a man near her roared
out: 'Why, the Queen--she's all locked up. They've got the
dragoons guarding her. Do you think the Queen wants to be
frightened with the like of we? She's got Melbourne, she has.
What is it to him or her if poor labourers suffer and our women
are stripped naked in the mines and bread's one-and-sixpence the
loaf? Ax the Queen! Aye, go and ax her and see what her soldiers
do to you!'</p>

<p>A confused babel of voices broke out. You could feel that the
temperature of men's blood was rising as though with every word
they moved closer together and closer and closer, so that at last
they seemed to be one man, a man with eyes red and burning, a
mouth hard set, cheeks hollow with hunger--a man with his hand
clenched to strike.</p>

<p>Someone leaped up and cried shrilly: 'Let us take what is
ours! Let us take what is ours! Let us take what is ours!'</p>

<p>Anything might have happened then. Adam, not knowing that he
did it, put his arm around Margaret and drew her nearer to
protect her; they were pressed back against the wall. No one
thought of his or her neighbour; a stout woman in an orange shawl
had her hand, without knowing it, on Adam's arm, and in a kind of
strangled sob was saying over and over: 'Aye--it's the People's
right--it's the People's right--it's the People's right . .
.'</p>

<p>Adam knew that in another moment there would be that strong,
swaying movement beneath their feet as though the floor were
stirring under them, and that then all would be swept together in
some mob-hysteria beyond control.</p>

<p>But it did not come. Instead the rotund little Chairman in
some way made himself heard. He said that Mr Kraft would speak to
them and, as Caesar rose to his feet, quiet came over everyone
again. How proud Adam was of him at that moment! His square
shoulders were set like those of a man carrying a banner; his
eyes spoke to some distance far beyond the hall and its
occupants; his voice, rich, warm, sincere, had no arrogance in it
and no self-seeking.</p>

<p>'I do not believe in disorder,' he said. 'Neither now nor at
any time. I know that our cause is just, but I find it so just
that it must have victory--but victory by law and not by riot.
Patience--'</p>

<p>At the word 'Patience' someone shouted out: 'We have been
patient long enough!'</p>

<p>Caesar went on: 'We have not been patient long enough. We can
never be patient long enough so long as we are moving. And we
<i>are</i> moving! We have our Six Points of our Charter, and
they are so right and so just that all the world will yield to
them. We are working for a prize greater and more lasting than
our immediate troubles. We are working for our children and our
children's children. What do we gain by fire and murder? We place
ourselves in the same case as our oppressors. We must believe in
justice, for there is justice in the world. Men may be unjust,
but behind them moves something stronger, finer and wiser than
man.'</p>

<p>He went on then to tell them what the heads of the movement
were doing, showed them their plans in detail, and was so
comprehensive, clear and wise that soon the hall was as quiet as
a vestry, and you could hear the rumble of the carts on the
cobbles outside. All then might have moved peacefully to its
close, but as soon as Kraft, to a hubbub of applause and clapping
of hands, had sat down, Lunt sprang to his feet. He stood swaying
on his short, strong legs, his body a little forward, his dark
face with its shock of black hair alive with indignation and an
almost mad impetuosity.</p>

<p>'I am Caesar Kraft's friend!' he called out. 'I <i>have</i>
been and shall be! But I say that his advice to you is the advice
of a dreamer! Wait, he says! Patience, he says! Yes, we are
patient, and meanwhile what happens! Our old men and children,
our wives and daughters, die in cellars swimming in filth, as I
have seen two dead today; our women starve naked in the fields
grubbing roots that pigs would refuse. Our men are beaten by
their masters until their backs drop blood. We starve. We starve.
Half the men in this room are starving now! And the Government
says--let them starve! The less work for us, the Government says.
Let them eat one another, the Government says, if they're hungry.
Let them lie closer to one another if they're cold! Why should
they interfere between slave and slave?'</p>

<p>He began to pace the platform, his face turned to them, his
body shaking with his vehemence.</p>

<p>'Why do we give opium to our little children? So that they may
forget their hunger! We entreat the Government to have mercy on
us, we send it petitions, we show it our naked backs and our
fever-dying comrades. "Oh yes," they say, and send us an answer:
"Sorry to say that it is altogether out of the power of Her
Majesty . . ." Her Majesty! And she feeding off gold plate and
riding in the Park of a morning! What does she know or care?
Patience, Caesar Kraft tells you, but <i>I</i> tell you that we
have had enough of patience, that they won't listen although we
call, that they laugh at our tears. The Towns must win the
Charter for England--men and women like yourselves--and not by
patience, not by sitting down and waiting while we starve, but by
rising and showing our power, by driving fear into their souls,
by putting those same dragoons out of the way that we may meet
the Queen face to face and say to her: "Here are your people! You
haven't seen them before, but take a good look at them--see their
backs how they bleed, how their stomachs are empty, their
children crying for food--"'</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a roar of voices. 'Aye! Aye! . . . We'll
go now. We'll go to the Queen . . . We've been patient enough! To
the Palace! To the Palace!'</p>

<p>Like a wind through trees the roomful swayed, then broke. Men
shouted, women called. The din was fearful, threatening, with
that note in it that no individual man can recognize as his own
and, after catastrophe, denies as his own.</p>

<p>They broke and rushed to the doors, Adam holding Margaret,
who, however, was almost as strong as he.</p>

<p>The noisy, shouting mob tumbled into the street to be met with
a fog as thick as a wall of suet. It was comic, that sudden
dropping of voices, that check on the rush and impulse as though
they had all found themselves on the edge of a precipice with the
sea booming below them. The street was quiet and chill; the fog
blew through the air in thick, yellow folds, laying its clammy
touch on every mouth. Figures shot up out of the dark, some of
them with flares, flamed and vanished. The crowd from the hall
passed like smoke into smoke.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam laughed. He put his hand through her arm and they walked
forward.</p>

<p>'Well--that is the end of <i>that</i> rioting. We must go
forward, trust our luck. We will reach a clearer patch soon.' The
fog was the one thing in all the world that could give him
courage to speak, for they were close together, but in
darkness.</p>

<p>So, when they had gone only a little way, he said
outright:</p>

<p>'Margaret, I love you. Will you marry me?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>

<p>He stopped where he was, put his arms round her and kissed
her. She did not move so he did not either. They seemed in a
trance, protected by the fog, her lips on his, his arms tightly
round her. At last when, very slowly, they moved on again he
said:</p>

<p>'I must tell you, Margaret, that I have no money, no home,
nothing.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said. 'Your home is with us.'</p>

<p>'And I have a mother whom I love more dearly than anyone but
you.'</p>

<p>She held his hand more tightly.</p>

<p>'I have no father, as you know. I have no family. I am
illegitimate.'</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>'You belong all the more to me for that,' she said.</p>

<p>Then a long while afterwards, when the fog in front of them
was clearing, she said, sighing:</p>

<p>'Oh, I did hope, Adam, that you loved me, for I loved you from
the first moment.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c203">HISTORY OF ELIZABETH</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam would have been greatly surprised had he realized that
not far from where he was standing that June day in 1838 Uhland
and Elizabeth had also witnessed the return of the Procession
from Westminster Abbey. Will had invited them to London for the
Coronation and they had accepted his invitation.</p>

<p>'Do you wish to go?' Walter had asked them. He also had been
invited, but an affair upon which he was just then engaged (a
highly exciting amorous affair with a lady who lived near
Cockermouth) prevented his acceptance. Moreover, he did not wish
to go; he found, if he were honest, his father a dull dog and his
mother a quite unspeakable bore. Yet in his own way he loved
them, wrote to his mother every month and sent his father
presents of game.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth heard of the invitation she waited breathlessly
to know whether she would be allowed to accept it. It was upon
just such an invitation that she had been counting, for she was
determined to escape from her father, from Ireby, from her
brother, and, if possible, never return.</p>

<p>She was now a beautiful girl, twenty-three years of age. Her
mother had died in the autumn of 1835, and since then she had not
known one moment's happiness.</p>

<p>When, so long ago, she and John had agreed to separate and not
to see one another again she had been but a child. She had forced
the separation upon John because she had been certain that
marriage with her would be for him a disaster. She was perhaps
wrong there. Had they at that time run away and married, the
whole course of their lives might have been altered to happiness,
but how could he run away when he was responsible for everything
at Uldale? Since then his sister had married Bellairs, but now
there was something stronger than any practical reason that drove
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She believed--and had more reason for her belief than anyone
outside the house at Ireby could know--that Uhland would kill
John if she married him. Wherever they went Uhland would find
them out. She had a terror of her father and brother that went
far beyond actual day-by-day fact.</p>

<p>Uhland's hatred of John became fanatical after he learnt that
Elizabeth cared for him. It became so fanatical that he did
nothing about it, as though he knew that he had only to bide his
time, as though he knew that there was no need for him to do
anything yet because John at Uldale was well aware of it; it was
as though he could see inside John's heart and feel the fear and
apprehension growing there. It was as though he felt that if he
did <i>yet</i> anything positive in word or deed it would hinder
the full flavour of his act when the real time for it
arrived.</p>

<p>There the two of them were, Uhland at Ireby and John at
Uldale, very near together, and, like a spell in witchcraft, the
power of the one over the other, although they never met, always
increased.</p>

<p>And in the same way, on the other side of the account,
Elizabeth's love for John never lessened, but increased.</p>

<p>She went about, saw many people in the County, made friends,
led outwardly a quiet normal life; she tried with all her force
(and she had much strength of character) to kill her love for
John. She seldom saw him in public, for people, knowing well the
old feud, took care that the two households did not meet.
Sometimes in the Keswick street, at a hunt, at a public ball,
they would catch sight of one another and turn away. John, on his
side, thought that he was only waiting until Elizabeth was old
enough. He knew that she was beautiful and rich and should make a
fine marriage. If she married him, when her father and brother
hated him so, it meant exile for her and, perhaps, disgrace. But
when she was of age she had only to make him a sign and he would
act. Nevertheless, although he was no coward in any other way,
the thought of Uhland made him sick. Often when he was busy about
the house or the farm or riding or paying a visit some dreaminess
would overtake him, it would seem to him as though with one step,
by unlocking some door he would pass into another world
infinitely more beautiful than this one. He had dreamt once as a
child of a marvellous white horse plunging through an icy tarn
and climbing, his mane flowing, the steep mountainside. He had
never forgotten the dream although it had never returned. If he
could ride that horse he would spring forward into regions of
splendour and eternal life! But again and again when such images
came to him, asleep at night, walking the fells, sitting half
awake by the fire, he seemed to hear a step behind him and would
start up, expecting to see the cold malicious face of Uhland
watching him.</p>

<p>So there they were, the three of them, in this summer of 1838.
Again and again afterwards Elizabeth would look back to this time
at Ireby and ask herself whether she did anything that fostered
later events. But she could not see that she was responsible. She
held on during that time to the principles, first that her
father's neglect of her and his scandalous behaviour should not
touch her, secondly that Uhland's taunts should not touch her,
thirdly that her love of John should not touch her. It was the
last of the three that at length drove her to flight. She
<i>could</i> not, she <i>could</i> not be so near to him and not
see him. Her father's behaviour she was by now accustomed to;
Uhland's taunts she could endure, but they were ingenious. He
would test her suddenly, unexpectedly. He would say: 'I hear
young Herries has made a fool of himself over that farm . . .'
'They are saying that John Herries has put a girl at Jocelyn's by
Troutbeck in the family way. He can't leave farm girls alone. He
has a low taste,' or 'They say that Herries goes to Cockermouth
and gambles night after night--gambling all the estate away, poor
fool . . . Hard on old Madame.' All lies of course! Walter
Herries would chuckle and shake his shoulders (he was growing
immense now although still handsome in a florid three-chin
fashion). But Elizabeth would not stir. She had all the Herries
pride. She would look at Uhland and smile very faintly, and he
would look gravely back at her. There would be at that moment a
strange subconscious alliance between them.</p>

<p>But by the summer of this year, 1838, she had reached the
limit of all her endurance. How she hated the Fortress no words
of hers could express. Even to the outside unprejudiced person it
was not a happy house as Westaways had been. Westaways had been
created by an artist, and it was a thousand pities that in the
autumn of 1836 it was pulled down by the purchasers of the land;
they had a plan for building an Almshouse there but this never
came to anything. All the eighteenth-century colour and glitter,
all the ambitions of Pomfret and Jannice, the childish hopes of
Raiseley and Judith and Anabel, the early ambitions of
Walter--all gone at the flourish of a hand, a little cloud of
dust rising slowly over the tumbling brick! And the Fortress was
not built by an artist! It was intended to stand for Herries
independence, strength and superiority. Good English material
power. Most certainly it looked strong enough with its
battlements and towers, its broad high rooms, its walls and
garden-paths and fountain. But it was never gay, never
light-hearted, never alive! Even Walter felt this. He entertained
there lavishly, had dinners and hunting-parties, dances and
drinking-bouts and, after Agnes' death, made it open house for
all the squires of the County. But it refused to come alive! Half
the rooms 'died on him', do what he would. He complained that
there was not sufficient feminine society in it. Elizabeth
entertained and she was a lovely hostess, quiet, dignified,
kindly. Everyone liked her, but everyone said that the place was
sad. They whispered that Walter beat her when he was in a drunken
temper. He did not beat her: he never ill-treated her: he gave
her everything that she asked. He simply did not consider her. A
Mrs Fergus, a genial stout widow, was housekeeper there during
these years. She was common, voluble, gossipy, a good manager.
She liked Elizabeth and tried to win her trust. But she did not.
She confided to everybody that something was the matter in that
house. It was as though a ghost were in every room in spite of
the drinking-parties and dinners.</p>

<p>It may have been that Uhland was the ghost. He had certainly
grown into a very severe, silent young man. Friendship with Adam
might have saved Uhland at this time. He showed from a
conversation that he had with Elizabeth in London that he was as
lonely as she. Adam was certainly the only human being in the
world to whom he would have disclosed himself. There was no doubt
but that during those years from 1832 to 1838 he was as unhappy
as Elizabeth was. It may be that at the end of it all he despised
and hated himself quite as much as he despised and hated John
Herries. No one will ever know.</p>

<p>Walter meanwhile, being really a foolish soul with very little
understanding of other human beings, continued to persuade
himself that Uhland adored him, adored the Fortress, adored the
fine fortune that Walter preserved for him (already not quite so
fine as it had once been: the Fortress like a heavy dull grey
monster swallowed greedily all that was offered it). His love for
Uhland was pathetic. He was like a big lumbering elephant
cherishing a morose young wolf.</p>

<p>And that was how things were when Elizabeth and Uhland went to
London.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they arrived, late one evening, in Hill Street, where was
Will's present town house, Uhland was in a monstrous temper
because of the bad time that they had had in the coach. They had
booked for the inside, of course, but there had been an asthmatic
gentleman with a cough so tiresome, and an old lady with so many
small packages that she was for ever undoing to see whether the
contents were safe, that Uhland had sought the roof. There were
not many passengers, and with extra money he had secured the
box-seat, and there wrapped in the leather-covered rug might have
been fairly comfortable, but then a storm had come on and the
rain had driven down his neck, his overcoat was soaked, and the
coachman was for ever thrusting his rein-elbow into his
(Uhland's) ribs. The day following had not been much better, for
the food at the inns was atrocious, and the manners of everyone
appalling. Why had they not tried the new railway? It was so
erratic. You never knew where it began and where it left off.
Worst of all, their hackney cab, when at last they got into it,
collided with a dray, and they were in perilous chance of
immediate death.</p>

<p>So they arrived at Hill Street and discovered that a grand
party was in progress. A tall gorgeously dressed footman hurried
them up the stairs as though they were very criminal indeed.
Everywhere were flowers; there was the distant music of a band
and the crackle of many voices. Elizabeth had not been in her
large cold room five minutes before a maid knocked, came in, and
asked her whether she should unpack for her.</p>

<p>'Her ladyship is unfortunately most unwell. She has been
confined to her bed for several weeks. She hopes to see you,
Miss, in the morning.'</p>

<p>Was she supposed to come down to the party, Elizabeth
wondered. Would she get anything to eat? She was inordinately
hungry. The maid, who looked a nice girl, Elizabeth thought, was
on her knees unpacking.</p>

<p>'Would you tell me your name?' Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p>'Ellen,' said the girl.</p>

<p>Elizabeth shivered. <i>How</i> hungry she was! And then,
miracle of miracles, the door burst open, and in came Sylvia
Herries looking radiant and lovely in pink tulle and carrying a
tray!</p>

<p>'Oh, my dearest Elizabeth!'</p>

<p>'Dear Sylvia!'</p>

<p>'But of course I knew that you would be <i>starving</i>, and
Frederick is bringing a warming-pan. You can place it under those
cushions and sit on it. How are you feeling, my sweetest
Elizabeth? But of course you must be <i>dead</i>! But how lovely
you are looking! A little thin . . . Was the journey quite, quite
dreadful? Ah, here is Frederick! There, Frederick--place it
beneath those cushions . . . Oh, dear little Elizabeth! I am
<i>ravished</i> to see you, and Cousin Will is giving the
grandest party. Mr Macaulay is here and Lady Brownlow and Lady
Euston and the Bishop of Oxford and <i>ever</i> so many more, and
James' wife is doing the honours. You never saw anything so
amazingly odd. She's wearing a turban like a pastry-cook's shop!
But there's no one so lovely as you are, so you must hurry, my
dearest, and eat this chicken and drink this champagne and wear
your <i>loveliest</i> costume . . . Now sit on the warming-pan,
dearest, <i>quite</i> still for five minutes. That will warm the
under part of you in any case. There's the most enravishing band
and I've danced five waltzes already . . .'</p>

<p>So Elizabeth sat on the warming-pan and then with the
assistance of Ellen and Sylvia put on her dress of white organdie
with a rose at her girdle, which, although it <i>had</i> been
made by little Miss Trent in Keswick, suited her exactly.</p>

<p>When she came into the big room, blazing with lights, swimming
in music, a kind of exultation seized her. How wonderful to have
escaped from that cold, grey Fortress with the heavy grey clouds
hanging over it, the stern dark landscape hemming it in, to this
scene of splendour and magnificence! Ah! If only John were here!
But one day he would be! They would be here together! She
deserved some life and some fun, surely.</p>

<p>Will came up to her and was very kind. He was of course stiff
and pompous a little, but he meant well and this was a big
occasion for him. He led her up to Lady Euston who, in satin, a
green turban and splendid diamonds, was the most terrifying lady
she had ever seen.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, and so you have come for the Coronation?'</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Let us trust that Providence will favour us with good
weather. It is very cold for the summer.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'This is your first visit to London?'</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Your cousin must bring you to Almack's, and you must visit
the Opera. How do you do, Sir Henry? I hear that Mr Croker has
written the most offensive article about Soult in the
<i>Quarterly</i> . . .'</p>

<p>Soon she was dancing, once with Garth, once with Amery, once
with Roger, Carey Rockage's son. Then with a gentleman whose
dress-coat was so extremely waisted that she was afraid lest he
should break in two at any moment. He wanted, very solemnly, to
tell her about the Park: 'Until recently the Park has been most
sombre and I assure you most unsafe for <i>anyone</i> after
nightfall. However, lamps with gas have now been introduced and
throw a noontide splendour. They combine in fact ornament with
utility, and vice has been banished from her wonted haunts . . .'
She supposed that he had something to do with the Parks, he
seemed so very serious about it.</p>

<p>Then Garth introduced her to a stout rather plethoric young
man, a Mr Temple, she understood. She had not waltzed with him
once around the room before she realized that he was greatly
charmed with her. He told her so; he led her away to a corner
behind a mass of begonias and, breathing hard to recover his
wind, said in a sort of wondering whisper that she was, upon his
life, the most lovely girl that he had ever seen. He begged her,
he implored her, not to take offence. The admission had been, to
his own amazement, compelled upon him. She could not take
offence. There was nothing offensive about him; he was like a
baby in his tight clothes, with a large diamond in his shirt and
his hair excessively pomaded. She wanted to laugh and, when he
left her for a moment to bring her some champagne, she did laugh.
She could not help it. She was happy. She was free. She would
never go back to Ireby again, and John would come to her.</p>

<p>'You have made a conquest, my dear cousin,' said Garth, a
little later.</p>

<p>'A conquest?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Edward Temple. He is the richest young man in London.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the course of the next week or so Elizabeth discovered a
number of curious and amusing things. Poor Christabel was, alas,
too ill to see her. She sent her loving messages and hoped that
she was enjoying herself. Elizabeth was chaperoned either by
Sylvia or by James' wife, Lady Herries, poor Beatrice. She was
known as 'poor Beatrice' because she said such silly things, wore
such hideous clothes, and tumbled into such foolish blunders, but
like many who are pitied by their fellows she was a great deal
happier than those who pitied her. She was good-natured, most
indiscreet, and admired Elizabeth's beauty with a sincerity that
was touching.</p>

<p>Will lived with much splendour. When they went to a ball or a
theatre or Vauxhall of an evening they were carried in a fine
painted 'chariot' with Frederick, the footman, in silk stockings,
plush breeches and hair-powder, standing behind; the Herries
family arms were on the panels. But the house in Hill Street
could not be said to be comfortable. That there were often
unpleasant 'whiffs' from the drains meant nothing. People even
preferred that the drains should 'smell' occasionally because
then they could tell which way the wind was blowing and whether
'there would likely be rain'. The furniture was fine, heavy and
impressive, but the passages and rooms were dreadfully chill, and
there was an air of mortality everywhere save when there was a
party. Elizabeth had some very dreary days and evenings. Will was
in the City all day, Uhland out and about on his own affairs, as
men, lucky creatures, were able to be, but unless Sylvia or Lady
Herries came for her she was sadly alone. All the Herries were
good and kind to her, but she soon perceived that they were,
nearly all of them, living above their means, reaching up to the
new grand position that Will's money and Sylvia's social
successes had brought to them. It said much for Will's dignity
and tact that, having made his position by business, he and his
should be admitted to Almack's and allowed the honours of Holland
House. But the Herries were a very old family, and the Rockages
had most certainly not made their money in business--having
exactly no money at all. Roger, Carey's boy, and his wife Janet
had a house in Mayfair during the Season and ordered little
dinners from the caterer (and <i>what</i> scrapes they went
through in order to pay the caterer no one knew but themselves);
then as soon as the Season was over they disappeared, with their
only child Carey, into two very shabby rooms in Pimlico, and
Janet did the cooking. The life of Sylvia and Garth, too, was one
long and exciting piratical adventure--a very thrilling volume of
hairbreadth peril and escape it would make. Garth spent much of
his time at Crockford's, which was not on the face of it a very
foolish thing to do, for the subscription was but ten guineas a
year, and in the gambling-rooms there was served a splendid
supper free, with excellent wine for all Mr Crockford's guests.
Behind this were, of course, for many a man ruin and despair. But
Garth was not a fool; he had some of his brother Amery's
astuteness, and he knew his world.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, however, was not like Judith. She could not throw
herself into whatever fun was going forward. She was quiet,
reserved and shy. All she wanted of life was that she should be
allowed to live quietly in a corner with John somewhere and never
be disturbed by anyone again.</p>

<p>She sat of an evening in the great drawing room or in her
bedroom, a book on her lap, and meditated her escape. For escape
she must. She knew that Uhland had some plan; she felt as though
with every hour he was the more closely driving her to some
purpose of his own.</p>

<p>There came an evening at Vauxhall when she began to realize
what his plan for her was. She went with Sylvia, Garth, Uhland
and Phyllis Newmark. It was all very splendid. There were the
'twenty thousand lamps' shining against the soft velvety sky of a
July evening, Ducrow and his horses, the famous bandstand round
which, if you were an unattached gentleman out for the evening,
you might swirl with the loveliest, if not the most virtuous,
ladies of the town, the fireworks and the vocal concerts.</p>

<p>For a while she enjoyed herself, listening to Sylvia's
chatter, liking the general gaiety and abandon; nevertheless, she
wondered, as she always did on these occasions, why she could not
throw herself into things as the others did. They must find her
dreadfully stupid, she thought, and, in fact, Garth that same
evening confided to Sylvia behind the bed-curtains that he
thought that little cousin of theirs mighty handsome, by Jove,
but she seemed to be feared of her life lest someone should kiss
her or chuck her under the chin; and Sylvia was forced to confess
with a sigh that she didn't come out as she'd hoped. She was more
at home, she suspected, in the country.</p>

<p>Well, later young Mr Temple joined them and, after that, poor
Elizabeth's evening was a ruin. Everyone beamed upon Mr Temple,
and soon he was seated with Elizabeth as his especial charge,
feeding her with chicken and ham. He had a great deal to say to
her, admired her gown and told of his place in Surrey where he
had horses, dogs and a piano. He said he was prodigiously fond of
music and the Italian opera. Very tenderly he helped her to a
'sliced cobweb'--the famous Vauxhall ham. His favourite
expression, the phrase of the moment, was, when he saw anything
amusing: 'What a bit of gig!'</p>

<p>Soon his absorption of the famous Vauxhall punch led him to
closer intimacies. He pressed her hand and wished to take her up
one of the shaded walks. From this Sylvia saved her, but she
observed with terror that Uhland watched these proceedings with
approval.</p>

<p>She did not sleep that night in her huge bed. What was she to
do? She felt utterly defenceless. She had not a friend in the
world. Strangely, she thought of Judith and Adam. What it would
have been to her just then to have seen that little old lady with
her sharp nose and kind bright eyes entering at the door, or Adam
with his strong, ugly, honest face standing beside her! But they
seemed far away, and John farther. She had no one to whom she
might turn. Beatrice Herries was too foolish and indiscreet,
Sylvia too flighty, Christabel too unwell. Of Will she was
afraid, Garth she did not trust. She was inexperienced in the
world's ways, and London seemed now like a great web in whose
sticky threads she was entangled.</p>

<p>Then one evening Uhland came to her room. She had but just lit
the candles. Bulwer's <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i> was in her
hand, but her mind was with John, running as it so often did over
those earlier days when they had written and met . . . He was
like her, she thought, shy, not caring for the world, uneasy with
others. Why could they not be together in some place where no one
else could come? Uhland sat near her and was kinder to her, at
first, than he had ever been. He wore black; his thin sharp
features had in them a shadow of suffering. She knew that he was
often in pain, and that feeling of some companionship between
them, something that lay deep, deep down below all this strife
and antagonism, stirred in her. They <i>could</i> be friends if
only . . .</p>

<p>He told her about some of the things that he had been doing.
He seemed to be as out of everything as she.</p>

<p>'I hate London. I do not belong here. They laugh at us as
country cousins.'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' she protested. 'They are so very kind.'</p>

<p>'Kind! Do you know what they say of us? They find us most
desperately dull, sister, and that's a fact. I hate drinking. I
won't play at cards. They swagger--Lord, how they swagger! And
then to be up all night and for nothing--women, drink,
gambling--gambling, women, drinking. Why, Ireby were better!'</p>

<p>He looked at her, one of those quiet speculative looks that
always made her afraid.</p>

<p>'I am different from everyone!' he burst out. 'They mock my
lameness!'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' she said gently. 'They don't think of it. Why, Sylvia
said--'</p>

<p>'Yes. Sylvia said--Sylvia said--' he answered contemptuously.
'Dear Sylvia had better take care or she'll have the bailiffs in
that pretty house of hers and Garth will be in the Marshalsea . .
. No,' he went on more quietly. 'It is my own fault; I am no
company for anyone here, not even for myself. There's a devil in
me that won't let me alone. We Herries are a poor lot unless we
take what's in front of our noses. We were not made to be
exceptional. Not that I'm exceptional, you know, except in my
temper. I despise their smugness. What do they know of what it is
to have a needle stab your leg every other minute, and to be
something that every woman pities? . . . No matter though. I
shall show them all one day . . .'</p>

<p>She did not dare to show pity. She knew how deeply he resented
it. But she said:</p>

<p>'We should go somewhere together, Uhland, the two of us. We
could go to the Colosseum or the Panorama. I should adore to see
the Panorama.'</p>

<p>But he did not answer her. He sat there brooding, looking
down, nursing his leg. There was something, she thought, twisted,
wizened about him, his thin small body bent, throwing strange
humped shadows on the wall in the candlelight.</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>'You are secure at least, Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>'Secure?' she asked him.</p>

<p>'Yes. Temple is crazy about you. He will be proposing for you
one of these days.'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' he answered. 'It is a fine match. There couldn't be
a better. He's something of a fool, of course. But that's his
age. He'll improve. I never knew a man more deeply in love.'</p>

<p>She said nothing. He went on:</p>

<p>'He is fabulously wealthy. He has his house in Belgravia and a
place in Surrey. Only an old mother to care for. He doesn't play
at cards and is afraid of loose women. You can do what you will
with him.'</p>

<p>'That, Uhland, you can dismiss altogether from your mind. I
should not marry him if there were no other man in the
world.'</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>'Still thinking of your friend in Cumberland?' he asked
her.</p>

<p>'No . . . But I would never marry Mr Temple.'</p>

<p>He got up and walked, limping, about the room.</p>

<p>'Never is a long story. It would be a fine thing. Our father
would think so.'</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>'There I am my own mistress.'</p>

<p>'Not entirely,' he said quietly. 'I think you had better
consider Temple.'</p>

<p>'And why?'</p>

<p>He stood by the door, his pale eyes gravely regarding her.</p>

<p>'Dear sister, consider what a fine husband Temple would make.
Consider it. Be wise,' and left her.</p>

<p>She was afraid after that and despised herself for being so.
What was there about Uhland that made everyone who knew him
apprehensive? Even the stable-boys at Ireby dropped their voices
when he was approaching, and she knew that people in Keswick
called him 'Little Mischief', although no one accused him of any
actual cruelties. On the contrary, that habit of kindness to
injured animals was still with him. He would be in a rage if he
saw a horse ill-used or a dog tied by the tail. And yet it was
not as though he cared for animals!</p>

<p>No, what they all felt about him was the potentiality of an
outburst. Society is built up on the convention that we all
<i>intend</i> to behave. That is the bargain we make the one with
the other. Then, if there is one who hasn't made the bargain! . .
.</p>

<p>In any case, Elizabeth felt some ring closing round her. She
was perhaps at that time young for her age. She had been always
with her mother, had known no other girls intimately. But this
was a situation in which other girls than herself might have been
frightened, for she knew that her father would regard this match
as a heaven-sent chance. He had always wanted to be rid of her.
Like so many men who are for ever making love to women he
despised them heartily and wanted them for one thing only. He
preferred greatly men's company, and the only chance that a woman
had with him as friend was for her to have something of the
downright and fearless about her as Judith had. Now Elizabeth had
nothing of the downright about her whatever. She was proud and
brave, but it was a pride that was too real to reveal itself and
a courage that was too real for cheap display.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune for her that Christabel was so ill, but
she did have one strange little conversation with her grandfather
which was to have important after-consequences for her.</p>

<p>Sir William Herries was now sixty-eight years of age and as
straight as a flag-pole. His hair was grizzled and he was very
thin of body with a sharp nose, high Herries cheek-bones, and a
severe, rather chilly eye that came from considering sums,
additions, subtractions, multiplications for sixty-five years. It
was at the age of three, his father David used long ago to
declare, that he had added his first sum, accurately, and without
assistance. He was dressed immaculately, always in black with
none of those gaudy waistcoasts, diamonds, pins and gold chains
that ornamented the bodies of the Disraelis, the Bulwers and the
Ainsworths of the day. But he was a splendid sight as you saw him
step out of the carriage that had brought him up from the City,
in the high hat, high stock, coat fitting perfectly at the
slender waist, and tightly strapped trousers. A fine sight as,
inside the cold hall with a marble statue of a goddess,
handsomely robed, holding aloft a lamp, he gives his hat, gloves
and cane to Frederick, passes his hand for a moment over his grey
locks, pinches his side-whiskers, and walks slowly, slowly up the
broad staircase.</p>

<p>'How is Lady Herries?' he asks Warren, the fat butler. 'Has
Doctor Salter paid his visit?'</p>

<p>'Doctor Salter has been, Sir William. Her ladyship is much the
same.'</p>

<p>'Ah . . . Ah. Ha! . . . Thank you, Warren.'</p>

<p>So one late afternoon, he came into the drawing room,
ornamented as was the earlier drawing room in the earlier smaller
house with oil-paintings of David his father and Sarah his
mother, and a huge marble clock that had Virtue seated in a toga
on the top of it, window hangings of a very grave mustard colour,
a table or two scattered with 'Beauty Books' and 'Keepsakes', the
poems of Felicia Hemans and a book of engravings of Greece and
Italy--all this as chill and as damp as a mausoleum, all this
bringing pride and comfort to his soul.</p>

<p>Today he moved about, putting a 'Keepsake' straight on a
table, arranging the hanging of one of the curtains, looking out
for a moment into the summer evening that was coquetting with
Hill Street. Then only was it that he discovered Elizabeth seated
on a sofa.</p>

<p>'My dear!' he exclaimed. 'I never saw you!'</p>

<p>'Good evening, Grandfather.'</p>

<p>He was weary, he was lonely, he had a pain in his side. He sat
down beside her. He had never been blind to feminine beauty
although he <i>had</i> married Christabel. His daughter, Alice,
who had died of a chill in 1812, had been as plain as her mother.
He was proud and pleased that his grand-daughter should be so
beautiful. Elizabeth's beauty lay in the perfection of her
delicacy, the rosy bloom of her colouring; her shoulders and
arms, revealed by the low cut of her cream-coloured dress, had
the soft firmness of a child's unawareness. Her hands,
exquisitely shaped, were both gentle and strong. She had the
fairness of a rose scarcely daring to open.</p>

<p>'I am afraid, my dear,' he said, 'that I have not seen so much
of you during this visit as I should have wished. I am growing an
old man, but I have never, all my life, learnt how to delegate
business to others. If I do not see to it myself it's done wrong.
I trust that you have been happy.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Grandpapa.'</p>

<p>'That's good. And Uhland?'</p>

<p>'I think he has been very happy.'</p>

<p>She longed to burst out: 'I am not happy at all! They want to
marry me to a young man I detest. You must prevent them.' But she
did not dare. She knew him so little, and he looked so very
imposing with his legs spread out in front of him and his long,
thin hands with the tapering fingers laid on his bony knees.</p>

<p>'It is a misfortune that your grandmother has been so
unwell.'</p>

<p>'I hope she is getting better,' Elizabeth said gently.</p>

<p>'No, my dear, I fear not. Doctor Salter is doing all he can,
but, as he constantly says, she will not make a sufficient
effort. A great pity! A great pity! Your grandmother is a
wonderful woman, my dear, but she has never had quite the courage
needed for a life like ours. After all, she is a woman.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Grandpapa.'</p>

<p>'And what have you been doing with yourself, my dear?'</p>

<p>Elizabeth told him some of the things that she had been
doing.</p>

<p>He nodded, rubbed his hands together, rose.</p>

<p>'Very good. Very good. I trust your grandmother will soon be
sufficiently well for you to see her. It is delightful for us to
have you here.'</p>

<p>But as he went out of the room and climbed the stairs he was
vaguely uncomfortable. Was she happy? She appeared lonely. That
brother of hers was a queer fish. Very queer. But then he was
crippled, poor child. Odd for Walter, big and healthy as he was,
to have a crippled son. What a beautiful girl! It did one good .
. . But he was vaguely uneasy, and the uneasiness remained.</p>

<p>Two days later Mr Temple came and proposed, and after that
events followed swiftly. He came with Sylvia Herries and they
drank tea together in the mustard-coloured drawing room. Sylvia
said that she must go and ask Mrs Arnold, the housekeeper, about
some silks that she wished to match. No sooner was she out of the
room than Mr Temple fell on his knees. It was a proposal in the
conventional fashion!</p>

<p>'Dearest Miss Herries! Oh, if I may only call you Elizabeth!
From the first moment I saw you I have been in a dream. You are
the only woman in the whole world for me. All that I have is
yours . . .' and so on and so on.</p>

<p>Elizabeth also behaved in the traditional manner.</p>

<p>'Pray, Mr Temple, rise from the floor.'</p>

<p>He caught her hand. He kissed it.</p>

<p>'I shall have to call for someone if you persist in this
ridiculous--'</p>

<p>'Adorable Elizabeth! Most heavenly--'</p>

<p>He climbed on to the sofa beside her and tried to kiss her
cheek.</p>

<p>'Please, Mr Temple.' Then she broke into sheer disgust. 'Oh,
go away! No, I do not love you. I can never love you. I do not
even care for you. No, not even with friendly feelings. This is
absurd. This is too absurd--'</p>

<p>She freed herself and stood with her hand on the
bell-rope.</p>

<p>He was amazed. He could not believe his ears. This was the
first proposal of his life, for he had always believed that
himself and his riches were irresistible and that when the time
did come for him to honour anybody there could be but one
possible result.</p>

<p>He was deeply chagrined. Even a tear rolled on to his fat
little cheek.</p>

<p>'Oh, dammit!' he cried, and went indignantly from the
room.</p>

<p>Next morning Uhland came to her in her room. His look of cold,
resolved anger terrified her; she felt as though he had
imprisoned her and would do what he pleased. The sense of power
that he spread about him was extraordinary.</p>

<p>'Elizabeth--what is this I hear? Temple has proposed and you
have refused him.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'You silly little fool! You are to write to him immediately
and say that you have reconsidered it.'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'But I say Yes. It is the very thing for you. Father will wish
it. All of us.'</p>

<p>'No, Uhland. I don't love him. I dislike him extremely.'</p>

<p>'Love? What is love? It is because you have still some
sentimental longing for that young prig in Cumberland.'</p>

<p>'You know,' she answered, 'that that was over long ago.'</p>

<p>'I know nothing of the kind. If you will not accept Temple I
shall charge your refusal to John Herries--and I shall know what
to do--'</p>

<p>'You can't harm him!' she answered fiercely, all her dread of
him gone. 'You can't touch him and you know it. But threats can't
serve you. Nor your bullying. I should never marry Mr Temple if
you starved me!'</p>

<p>'You <i>shall</i> marry him,' he answered.</p>

<p>He came up to her and put his cold, damp hand on her bare
shoulder. 'I know what is good for you and I will see to it.'</p>

<p>He looked at her and left the room.</p>

<p>After that she had only one thought--flight. She had already
for weeks been contemplating it. She had plenty of spirit, and
the thought that at last she would escape from Ireby, from this
house, from her father, from all these Herries relations gave her
wings. That afternoon she searched <i>The Times</i> and at last
found what she wanted. A Mrs Bohun Winstanley of 21A Sloane
Street had an agency for 'Governesses, Companions, Situations for
Genteel Persons'. Ellen, the maid, was her next resource. She
had, in these weeks, won Ellen's devoted affections, not
difficult considering her beauty, charm and gentleness. It seemed
too that Ellen hated her place here, hated Mrs Arnold, the
housekeeper, and was only waiting an opportunity to give her
notice. Elizabeth told Ellen everything, even her love for John,
and Ellen's eyes grew moist with sentiment as she drank in the
details of such a romance. Ellen was sworn to secrecy. On the
following day, having packed Elizabeth's box, she was to take a
hackney-cab and meet Elizabeth outside St Clement Danes Church at
midday. To this Ellen swore: she also protested that the most
horrible tortures man (Ellen's natural enemy) could devise would
not tempt her to betrayal. Elizabeth kissed her.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, wearing her quietest bonnet, she
slipped out of the house into Hill Street. It was a fine morning
and she walked out of her way to Charing Cross, taking her time
lest Mrs Bohun Winstanley should not yet be at work. No one
interfered with her. A cheap dandy with a sham diamond pin and a
double-breasted waistcoat ogled her, a policeman in a blue
swallow-tailed coat and white trousers glanced at her with some
curiosity, but for the most part everyone was busy about his or
her own business. There was a great deal of noise with the bell
of the crier, the horn of the omnibus, the Italian boy and his
hurdy-gurdy, and the shops with their small-paned bow-windows
were opening, somewhere church bells were ringing. Everywhere
everything was entrancing, for at last, at last, she was
free!</p>

<p>When she thought the time was come she mounted inside an
omnibus and at length was put down at the top of Sloane Street.
Soon Number 21A was found, a dingy door, a still dingier
staircase. One flight up, in faded green letters, was Mrs Bohun
Winstanley's name. Entering she found a room, grimy and
disordered, with a shabby canary moulting in a shabby cage by the
very dirty window, and a lady in a bonnet and mittens seated at a
table strewn with papers. Standing in front of the empty grate
was another lady, wearing a very gay bonnet covered with flowers,
and a bright emerald-green shawl. This lady was tall, thin, and
plainly in the worst of tempers. The lady at the table was small,
and, at the moment, alarmed. A dewdrop trembled at the end of her
nose, her mittens quivered with a life of their own, and she
murmured again and again: 'Oh dear! Oh dear! But it is so
<i>early</i> . . . so early, Mrs Golightly . . .'</p>

<p>'Early! Early!' cried the other lady, while all the flowers
trembled in her bonnet in sympathy. 'Don't speak to me of
"early", Mrs Winstanley. A promise is a promise!'</p>

<p>'But her little girl has the croup.'</p>

<p>'And what of <i>my</i> little girls, Mrs Winstanley? What of
<i>my</i> little girls? Here have they been these three weeks,
and Mr Golightly in Bath and returning tomorrow--'</p>

<p>It was then that both ladies together noticed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Mrs Winstanley.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, I am sure,' said Elizabeth. 'I can wait
outside--'</p>

<p>'But what <i>is</i> it?' said Mrs Winstanley, plainly near to
tears.</p>

<p>'I read your advertisement in <i>The Times</i>,' said
Elizabeth. 'I am looking for a place as governess or
companion--'</p>

<p>Both ladies stared at Elizabeth. They had obviously never seen
anyone so beautiful before.</p>

<p>'Sit down, pray,' Mrs Winstanley said at last (and it was
clear that she saw, in Elizabeth, the ship of rescue). 'Now, Mrs
Golightly, this is a young lady of whom I intended to have spoken
yesterday--'</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly stared and stared.</p>

<p>'You are looking for a place?' she said at last.</p>

<p>'Yes. ma'am.'</p>

<p>'What is your name?'</p>

<p>'Mary Temple.' (Oh, how absurd! She had taken Mr Temple's name
after all!)</p>

<p>'How old are you?'</p>

<p>'Twenty-three, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'What experience have you had?'</p>

<p>'I think,' broke in Mrs Winstanley, 'that you will find that
she has had excellent experience.'</p>

<p>'Has she?' said Mrs Golightly doubtfully. 'She looks very
superior, I must say.' Then she added: 'And your references?'</p>

<p>'I will speak for her references,' said Mrs Winstanley
quickly.</p>

<p>'Ours is a very agreeable family,' Mrs Golightly said in a
kind of dream. 'My two little girls are angelic--less than no
trouble at all . . . When could you come?' she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>'This afternoon,' said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>'Very odd. Very odd, indeed. Have you French, Arithmetic, the
Pianoforte, Dancing, Deportment? . . .'</p>

<p>'I think you will find that Miss Temple has everything that
you require,' Mrs Winstanley quickly inserted.</p>

<p>'Indeed!' Mrs Golightly still stared in a kind of dream. 'Very
distinguished!' she murmured. 'You are familiar with the
Poets?'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon?' Elizabeth said.</p>

<p>'Shakespeare, Milton, Lord Byron, Mrs Hemans--'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' said Elizabeth, 'I think so.'</p>

<p>'You <i>think</i> so,' said Mrs Golightly. 'Don't you
<i>know</i>?'</p>

<p>'She is especially familiar with the Poets,' said Mrs
Winstanley, speaking very gently and nodding her head.</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly stared and stared.</p>

<p>'You can come this evening?' she said at last.</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' Mrs Golightly said, turning to Mrs Winstanley,
'she may be a thief in collusion with all the thieves of the
Metropolis. Pray, don't think me rude,' she went on, turning to
Elizabeth again, 'but it is so very odd. I know nothing whatever
about you. With whom were you last?'</p>

<p>'I am sure that you will find everything perfectly correct,'
said Mrs Winstanley.</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly stared a little more.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know, I'm sure. If Mr Golightly had any liking
for young ladies the idea would be absurd, but as he has never
given one a thought, being far too closely occupied by his
beetles and butterflies . . .' She nodded her head. 'Very well,
then. This evening. Mrs Winstanley will explain the terms,' and
without another word she left the room, banging the little door
behind her.</p>

<p>'And now,' said Mrs Winstanley gently, and blowing her nose,
'pray, tell me, my dear, who you are.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c204">THE GOVERNESS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Elizabeth read her letter over again. In a few minutes she
must go to Mrs Golightly's boudoir, where she must read for an
hour while the moths buzzed about the lamp, the silly clock
ticked, and the words of the novel in her hand moved in a mist of
confusion before her heavy eyes. For she was very weary, as
indeed she was always weary at this hour in the evening. Clarissa
and Francesca were happily asleep in bed, lost in slumber,
although safe neither from suffocation (for their bedroom would
be hermetically sealed) nor from bugs. The little house in
Islington crawled with animals, bugs and beetles and cockroaches
(Alice the kitchen-maid, who slept in the kitchen, spent most of
her day killing them: she was too tired at night to care), while
spiders hung in every corner and dust lay on tables, sills and
shelves as thick as the sand of the desert. In the meantime Mrs
Golightly, surrounded with emerald-green curtains, ottomans and
'Keepsakes', sat in her evening yellow silk, her ringlets bound
by her 'arcade' (a wonderful arrangement of wires twined with
rosebuds, lace and ribbon), waiting for Elizabeth to continue her
reading of <i>Agnes Serle</i> by Miss Ellen Pickering.</p>

<p>This was Elizabeth's letter:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p align="RIGHT">4 Praed Street, Islington,</p>

<p align="RIGHT"><i>March 4th, 1839</i></p>

<p>BELOVED JOHN--I cannot, try as I may, refrain any longer from
writing to you. The thought of your anxiety for me (for I do not
I think flatter myself that you must be anxious) has been a
motive ever more constant with me. But this I could have resisted
were it not that your dear image, for so many many years now the
dearest to me in all the word, refuses to leave to me the proper
control of my feelings.</p>

<p>I know only too well, dearest John, that I am breaking all the
vows that I have made and upon which I was myself formerly the
most insistent. I am aware that all the reasons that kept us
apart must keep us apart still: indeed their influence must be
stronger with us than before since the irrevocable nature of my
own desperate deed! How desperate it must seem to my own family
you will realize from the fact that neither my father nor brother
have made the slightest effort to find me out. I will admit to
you that it is the increasing sense of my own loneliness that
compels me to write to you. I had hoped that, cut off from all
family ties, I might learn to forget you, but, dear John, true
love is not so easily set aside and however dearly I have loved
you in the past I must confess that it is only in these last
weeks that I have realized to the full how deep and constant that
love must be.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is shameful of me to make this confession to you,
but shameful or not it must be made, for without some word from
you I truly think that I shall die. I have not formerly been
weak. I am weak now and must detest my weakness even while I
yield to it.</p>

<p>I would not wish you to think that I am unhappy with Mrs
Golightly, the lady in whose house I live and to whose little
girls I am governess. She is not indeed at all unkind, only
rather foolish and unable to keep her house clean or manage it
with any efficiency. The two little girls are good and patient,
poor little things, although entirely neglected. Mrs Golightly
reads novels, recites poetry, has evening parties and attends
concerts in Hanover Square, while Mr Golightly, who is fat and
absentminded but also kindly, collects moths and butterflies,
which takes him very often into the country. Meanwhile the house
is a ruin, the cooks come and go every week and only poor Alice,
the kitchen-maid, is faithful and does all the work of the
place.</p>

<p>Dear John, I think I have grown into a woman in these last
months and see life more sanely than I did. I had, I do not
doubt, an exaggerated picture of my father and my brother and
although I know they do not love me and have never loved me, they
are neither so hard nor so unkind as I at one time thought them.
But do not think me cowardly, dear John, in thus writing to you.
I am not thinking of changing my life but only that you should
sometimes write me a letter and give me the opportunity to write
to you. You understand, do you not, that no one is to know of
where I am nor of what I am doing. No one save yourself. It is to
be a secret from everyone, but I love you so much that I think I
shall be insane if I do not hear from you. Later on perhaps you
will come to London and we shall meet again. Only to think of
such a meeting sends me crazy with joy and happiness. But I know
that you will answer this letter and that is all the happiness I
wish for at this present time. Your most loving</p>

<p align="RIGHT">ELIZABETH</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>She folded it up and sealed it.</p>

<p>'I am very wicked,' she thought. 'I have never done anything
so really wrong as this before. But I don't care.' She further
thought that she had been stupid not to have done this long ago.
Her months with Mrs Golightly had made her begin to wonder
whether she had not paid altogether too much attention to the
decencies. She did not realize that it was the escape from the
Cumberland house that had changed her, the fact that she was
emerging from the influence both of her father and brother, who
until now had dominated her whole life.</p>

<p>She put on her bonnet and shawl, opened the door, listened,
ran downstairs, down the front steps, then along the lamp-lit
street to the post office. She hesitated a moment before dropping
the letter in. Was it right? No, it wasn't right. Nevertheless,
in it went. She stared defiantly about the street, but there was
only one hackney-cab crawling along and an Italian organ-grinder
with a shivering monkey in a crimson coat. She dropped a sixpence
into the little monkey's cup as a sort of oblation. The monkey
looked at her with eyes so old and so sad that she could not
resist a little shudder. It was as though the monkey said: 'We
are all cold. All lost. All doomed. There's nothing to be done
about it . . .'</p>

<p>On the other hand, Alice, with a large smut across her nose,
was looking up from the bottom of the area steps. She had a large
broom in her hand which she waved in a cheerful fashion as much
as to say: 'We're friends, we are. I know what you've been doing
and wish you all the luck.' The thin strains of the barrel-organ
echoed down the empty street as though they, too, wished her good
fortune.</p>

<p>She ran quietly up the stairs, took off bonnet and shawl,
brushed her ringlets and, with <i>Agnes Serle</i> in hand,
marched down to the boudoir.</p>

<p>'Aren't you a little late, my love?' asked Mrs Golightly, who
was reclining at ease with her velvet slippers toasting at the
fire. The pug, Levilla, was on her lap, choking as usual.</p>

<p>'Yes, I think I am, a little,' said Elizabeth gently, and,
opening her book, began to read.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She had remarked to herself again and again in these months
how completely now she was separated from the Herries world. It
was as though they lived, all of them, in another continent. Mrs
Golightly did on occasion read out from the newspaper some social
item, and once she remarked with a great deal of unction that she
saw that Sir William Herries had been doing this or that. 'Let me
see,' she went on. 'He is a cousin, I fancy, of Lady Rockage, and
there is that lovely Mrs Garth Herries whose name you see
everywhere. They are all the same family, I imagine.'</p>

<p>But Mrs Golightly and all her friends spoke of Gore House or
Almack's as one speaks of Paradise. But with no envy. She had her
world and was perfectly content with it, but the division between
her world and that other one was quite complete. Mrs Golightly
was a generous, unenvious person altogether. She thought her
husband, children, friends and home all quite perfect. It was the
fashion, moreover, for herself and her friends to be romantic
about everything, and this same Romance gave them every kind of
satisfaction. They liked their literature, their painting, their
music, their religion to be romantic. They felt deeply and
sincerely for all Oppressed Peoples. Mrs Golightly was for ever
attending meetings for the poor Poles, for the Negro (whom they
went so far as to call their brother), for the unhappy Greek and
the neglected Hottentot. That her house was in a mess and that
the slums, factories and mines quite close to home needed
attention--these things were never discussed because they were
<i>not</i> romantic.</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly enjoyed entertaining her friends in the evening
(a little music on the pianoforte, a little 'dance' in the very
small drawing room), she enjoyed a walk with Mr Golightly when he
was at home, a visit to the theatre or a concert--but perhaps
more than anything else she enjoyed sitting with her toes in
front of the fire of an evening and listening to Elizabeth's
reading of a novel. That original inquiry at the Agency about the
Poets had been genuine enough, but when it came actually to
<i>reading</i>--well, the novel was the thing! Elizabeth had a
beautiful, quiet, cultivated voice, as Mrs Golightly told all her
friends. It was a pleasure indeed to listen to her. So Elizabeth
read, night after night, from the works of Bulwer, Ainsworth,
that delightful new writer Charles Dickens, Theodore Hook, Mrs
Gore, Miss Austen ('a <i>little</i> dull, my love--not enough
Event') and even some of the old 'Minerva Press'
romances--<i>Mandroni, Rinaldo Rinaldini</i> and <i>The Beggar
Girl and her Benefactors,</i> the last in seven volumes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two little girls went on as best they might. It
would not be true to say that Mrs Golightly did not love her
children. She loved them very dearly. But they, too, must be
romantic. She dressed them in very bright colours, showed them to
her friends with pride and left Elizabeth to do the rest. They
became deeply attached to Elizabeth. They never had seen anyone
so lovely and, in fact, would never see anyone so lovely again.
Although she dressed in the quietest way, never raised her voice
and never lost her temper, they obeyed her and told her
everything. Alone with her they chattered and chattered, asking
her innumerable questions. She taught them what she could with
the aid of Butter's <i>Exercises on the Globes,</i> Lindley
Murray's <i>English Grammar</i> and Goldsmith's <i>Poems for
Young Ladies,</i> but she had never had very much education
herself and was appalled at her own ignorance.</p>

<p>Although a strong offshoot of the City ran past Sadler's Wells
through the High Street, Islington was nevertheless a little
country town of its own, filled with trees and gardens. The
Golightlys had their carriage and drove into Town on necessary
occasions, but, socially, their world was their own world and
they gave little thought to any other. Elizabeth's arrival here
was a sensation and, during the first weeks, the bachelors,
handsome young men, and gay old married ones attempted every kind
of flirtation. They found her, however, so unapproachable that
she achieved the reputation of an Islington mystery. It was soon
asserted that she was the child of a noble lord who had attempted
to marry her to a villain, that she was the child-bride of an
aged marquis who violently ill-treated her, that she was heiress
to a vast property and had fled from unwelcome suitors.</p>

<p>She was too kind and gentle to be disliked by them; she gave
herself no airs; she listened to their stories and was grieved
for their misfortunes. Mrs Golightly did her utmost to discover
her secret, and even Mr Golightly would look up from his
butterflies, smile in a mysterious manner, nod his head and say:
'We expect you to be carried off from us in a gilt chariot any
day, my dear.'</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly's methods were more subtle. On one of the
reading evenings she would break out with:</p>

<p>'You mentioned, did you not, my love, that your brother was in
the Army?'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' Elizabeth would reply. 'I have no relations in the
Army.'</p>

<p>'Indeed! Well, fancy that! It must have been the Navy you
said.'</p>

<p>'Nor in the Navy,' Elizabeth would reply, smiling.</p>

<p>Or Mrs Golightly would look at her with great tenderness,
remarking:</p>

<p>'That must have been a sweetly pretty Ball at Lady
Carrington's yesterday evening. Young Lady Hermione Blossom was
looking her loveliest, I understand . . . You doubtless know her,
Mary, my love.'</p>

<p>'No,' Elizabeth would murmur. 'I have never seen her.'</p>

<p>'Ah, so you say!' Mrs Golightly would reply, looking very
arch. 'We know what we know.'</p>

<p>The children were pressed into service, but they, poor dears,
were so simple and innocent that they had no wiles.</p>

<p>'Oh, Miss Temple,' Francesca would say. 'Mama says that
everyone knows that you are not Miss Temple really, and that you
will be leaving us very shortly.'</p>

<p>'I have no intention of leaving you, Francesca.'</p>

<p>'Mama says that you have fled from persecuting parents.'</p>

<p>'Does she, Francesca? I have not fled from anyone.'</p>

<p>And Clarissa, who loved Elizabeth with passion, would hold her
hand as though it were a pump-handle and exclaim: 'I am certain
that you are a Princess in disguise, dear Miss Temple, and I
<i>do</i> love you so!'</p>

<p>'There are no real Princesses,' Elizabeth would answer. 'Only
in fairytales.'</p>

<p>She managed for a while well enough. They were kind to her,
and it was not their fault that she knew with every week more and
more unbearable loneliness and longing. Then came the egregious
and appalling Mr Roberts. Mr Frederick Roberts was a stout,
cheerful, noisy young man who was the practical joker of the
group. He was absent during the first part of Elizabeth's
sojourn, in Scotland. Everyone spoke of him with rapture.</p>

<p>'Wait, my love, until Mr Fred Roberts returns!' Mrs Golightly
cried. 'Islington is not the same without Mr Roberts. Mr Roberts
has the life of a thousand. He is the wittiest young man in
London.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth awaited his arrival with some eagerness. He could do
everything--play the pianoforte, sing a song, shoot birds, hunt
the fox, dance like an angel and join anyone for any length of
time at Commerce, Vingt-et-Un or Speculation. He could imitate
Webster or Buckstone or Fanny Kemble as though they were in the
room with you. He was the soul of good nature, and all the young
ladies in Islington wanted to marry him.</p>

<p>When he did arrive Elizabeth found him truly terrible. He was
fat, coarse, common, self-satisfied, exceedingly conceited and as
noisy as the fireworks at Vauxhall. But, worst of all, he must
for ever be playing practical jokes. Practical jokes were 'the
thing' in Islington; everyone loved them, but no practical-joker
anywhere was as inexhaustible in his energies, as fertile in his
resources as Fred Roberts.</p>

<p>He marked down Elizabeth at once as his future bride. He
proposed to her on the second evening after meeting her and, when
she indignantly refused him, roared with laughter and would have
slapped her on the back had she not eluded him. His 'jokes' were
endless. You never knew when you were safe from him. One of his
most famous was the occasion when at supper at Mrs Preedy's he
poured melted butter into all the gentlemen's pockets. He loved
to tie two doors together, ring both bells and watch the result
round a corner. On one most laughable occasion he arrived at the
Livingstone-Jones' with a tray of medicated sweets so that
everyone was ill. He came to a Masquerade with mice in his
pocket, let them loose and returned in another costume to enjoy
the results. When Mrs Bonnington lost her husband he appeared by
her bedside as the ghost of her departed (she was ill after this
for weeks). Mrs Green had a stout and elderly butler into whose
shoes he fastened tin-tacks so that poor James, putting them on
unsuspectingly, fell down a flight of stairs and was nearly
killed. How Frederick laughed when he heard of it! And the odd
thing was that everyone liked him for these games! They thought
him the funniest, jolliest fellow and declared that any girl who
'caught' him would be lucky indeed!</p>

<p>He had never, it seemed, been 'seriously inclined', although
he was 'something good' in the City and could marry whenever he
wished. Now he <i>was</i> 'caught', and it was Elizabeth who had
'caught' him.</p>

<p>Poor Elizabeth! Mr Temple had been nothing to this!</p>

<p>It was, however, her terror of Mr Roberts that drove her to
write to John. It seemed that there was no safety for her
anywhere--if not one, then another. She even discovered herself
thinking of the Fortress as a place of security.</p>

<p>If she left the Golightlys and went elsewhere it would be the
same--danger everywhere.</p>

<p>A few days after posting her letter a worse thing than Mr
Roberts occurred--Mr Golightly fell in love with her. She had
never thought of him save that he was kindly and that he passed a
dazzled, bewildered existence in a maze of coloured insects. He
had means of his own that he had inherited from his father, a
wealthy merchant who had dealt in candles or something of the
kind. He had never been known to look at a woman save Mrs
Golightly, at whom, moreover, he, on the whole, looked as little
as might be. His fidelity to his butterflies was absolute.</p>

<p>There came then an evening. Mrs Golightly went to join her two
friends, Miss Sanders and Mrs Witsun, at the house of their
mutual friend, Mrs Peters, for a game of Commerce. The girls had
gone to bed, and Elizabeth sat in her room pretending to read and
thinking of John. She thought now of John every moment of the
day. How was her letter faring? How soon might there be a reply?
And, surrounding John, encompassing and enveloping him, was the
country of her home, the silver river through the flat
Portinscale fields, Main Street in Keswick with Miss Hazlitt's
bow-window and the coach standing . . .</p>

<p>A knock on the door. Enter Mr Golightly. She was so deeply
amazed that she could not speak. There he stood with his round
stomach in a flowered waistcoat, his coat-tails spreading
fan-wise over his fat thighs, buckles on his shoes and spectacles
on the end of his nose.</p>

<p>He closed the door firmly.</p>

<p>'This is an opportunity,' she heard him say to himself. He
came forward and without another word fell immediately on his
knees in front of her. His spectacles jerked to the ground and he
gazed up at her with blue eyes, childlike and innocent, eyes
dimmed because they had seen the world for so long behind
glasses, eyes that had gazed for years upon butterflies. She
tried to rise, but he put his fat hand on her knee and burst out
at once:</p>

<p>'Miss Temple--Mary, I am well aware that this is disgraceful.
I am proud that it is. I have wished for years to do something
disgraceful. I doubt whether anything could be more disgraceful
than this. I am old enough to be your father, but I love you
passionately. I may say that I have never loved anyone
passionately before. And when I say passionately I mean
passionately.'</p>

<p>'But, Mr Golightly--this is shameful--'</p>

<p>'I know that it is shameful. I have been struggling against it
for several weeks. At least I have been struggling against
<i>not</i> struggling against it.'</p>

<p>She did manage to rise.</p>

<p>'But this is abominable. In Mrs Golightly's absence--'</p>

<p>'Oh, damnation take Mrs Golightly!' he burst out, clasping her
skirts and holding her firmly. 'What do you think it is to sleep
year after year with Mrs Golightly in a four-poster? What do you
think it is to wake early in the morning and see Mrs Golightly
beside you? Were it not for my butterflies I should have gone mad
long ago. And you, loveliest of virgins, what do you know of
four-posters? Do you realize what a four-poster <i>might</i> be?
Even I, old as I am, could . . .'</p>

<p>But that was enough. She tore herself from his clinging hands
and went, even as she had done in Hill Street, to the
bell-rope.</p>

<p>'One word more, Mr Golightly, and I summon Alice.'</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. He was trembling and there were beads of
perspiration on his nose. Without his spectacles he seemed oddly
undressed.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he murmured. 'I must appear revolting to you. It is
natural that I should. It is my fate that I must appear revolting
to everyone save Mrs Golightly.'</p>

<p>He bent down and picked up his spectacles. She thought that he
was near to tears.</p>

<p>'Forgive me,' he said. 'I could not help myself and I am glad
that I could not. I am still a man, not a mummy. Oh! how
beautiful you are!'</p>

<p>And he went, wiping his spectacles in a large orange
handkerchief, from the room.</p>

<p>After this there was nothing for it but flight. Mr Golightly
<i>and</i> Mr Roberts! And if Mrs Golightly discovered . . . But
she did not want to go before she had had her letter from John.
<i>One</i> letter from him and she would be better prepared to
face the world again. Days went by. The beetles crawled in the
kitchen. <i>Agnes Serle</i> came to her conclusion and was
immediately followed by <i>Adelaide or the Countercharm</i>, the
odious Mr Roberts proposed to her three times, on every occasion
with peals of laughter--and still there was no letter from
John.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then came the party. This was the grandest party that Mrs
Golightly had yet given in Islington--dancing, music, Commerce
and Speculation, everything that the heart could desire. The
whole house was 'cleared' for the event. The dining room was not
far from the drawing room. In the drawing room there would be
music and then dancing. Mr Fortescue would play on the violin,
Mrs Porter's two daughters would sing duets, Mr Fred Roberts
would give his Imitations and comic songs. It was also
confidently expected that Mr Roberts had some special 'joke', a
secret from everyone but himself.</p>

<p>The supper came from the caterer's, who also provided two
long, thin men with immense side-whiskers to serve as waiters.
Poor Alice was driven from one pillar to another post all day and
all night, while Mrs Thackeray, the at-the-moment cook (she had
given notice and was to leave directly <i>after</i> the party),
for a brief while permitted herself to be amiable because, like
every other servant in the world, she enjoyed a party.</p>

<p>When the guests were all assembled the sight was very
impressive. The house was swollen with the guests. They were in
the hall, on the stairs, hanging out of window, flooding dining
room and drawing room. The gentlemen, many of them with long and
wavy hair, had high black stocks enriched with massive pins; the
white shirt-cuffs were neatly turned over the wrists, dress-coats
buttoned, trousers tight with straps and pumps. The ladies either
wore curls neatly arranged on each side, or their hair dropped in
a loop down the cheek and behind the ear, and then fastened in
some kind of band with ribbons at the back of the head. Pink was
the favourite colour, pink with plenty of lace and artificial
flowers. The older ladies were magnificent in turbans, and some
of the younger wore across the forehead a band of velvet or silk
decorated with a gold buckle, or something in pearls and
diamonds. Miss Sanders, who was sixty if a day, had a black
ribbon across her brow, the ribbon containing in the middle a
steel buckle.</p>

<p>Every lady, of course, wore cleaned kid gloves, and the
turpentine that had gone to the cleaning of them gave off a
pungent and powerful odour. Quadrilles were still danced and even
the Country Dance lingered, but the Valse was the true
enchantment, although in Islington it was still considered rather
advanced and daring, and always everyone was afraid to be the
first to commence. Once and again the dancing was stopped for a
little music, and Miss Merryweather sang in her piercing soprano
or the Misses Porter gave one of their delightful duets. At first
everyone was as polite as polite could be. The gentlemen stood by
themselves and the ladies by <i>themselves</i>, but soon the
punch-bowl had been mixed--a lovely mixture of rum, brandy,
Curacao, lemon, hot water, sugar, grated nutmeg, cloves and
cinnamon. There was also rum-shrub. And above all, for the
gentlemen, Bishop. Bishop was a kind of punch made of port wine
instead of rum, and exceedingly potent it was. It was the Bishop,
possibly, that accounted in the end for Elizabeth's terror and
distress.</p>

<p>Very soon everyone became very jolly, and of course the
jolliest of them all was Fred Roberts. Before the evening had
exhausted an hour of its splendour he had fastened three girls
into a cupboard, let off a squib under Miss Merryweather's skirts
(and her shriek was of a more violent soprano than any betrayed
by her singing!), piled three plates on the lintel of the door so
that they crashed on to the head of one of the long, thin
waiters; but his great feat was that he had brought a live
grass-snake in his pocket, and this he sent crawling over fair
arms and necks until ladies stood on chairs and one Miss Porter
fainted (or was it, as some said, that she had enjoyed the
rum-shrub?).</p>

<p>He was the greatest success. Everyone voted that they had
never seen him in so splendid a humour, and he <i>was</i> in fine
form, for he had a bet with six of his Islington cronies that
before the evening was over he would be able to announce to all
the world that the beautiful Miss Temple had consented to be his
bride.</p>

<p>During the earlier hours, however, he left Elizabeth to
others, although his merry eye was always upon her. At first
things were not so terrible. She sat with Mrs Devizes, a lady who
was vastly proud of her house, 'twice the size of this, my dear'.
And must describe with perfect happiness her mahogany table and
curtains of crimson rep, her gilt fleur-de-lis wallpaper and the
way that she preserved her gooseberries and currants.</p>

<p>How Elizabeth prayed that she might be left alone with her,
for she was tranquil and calm, and, as her words flowed on, it
seemed that life somewhere must be secure--an enclosed world
under a glass bell, mahogany, crimson rep and gooseberries.</p>

<p>But she was not allowed to stay where she was. For, in the
first place, Mrs Golightly was so happy at the social success of
her party that she was talking about Elizabeth to everyone, how
she was certain that she was the daughter of a Duke, how good she
was and beautiful she was, and how indebted she was to Mrs
Golightly, who 'treated her just like one of her own daughters'.
So naturally the young men came up and besought her to dance with
them, and then, while valsing, paid her fatuous compliments and
fought with one another over the honour of claiming her. Everyone
began to be greatly excited, the ladies as well. Games were
proposed, Forfeits, and Blind Man's Buff and
Catch-in-a-Corner.</p>

<p>Elizabeth slipped out of the room only to find Mr Golightly,
the worse for Bishop, standing in a corner near the window,
staring quite desperately in front of him.</p>

<p>He caught her arm and drew her to the window.</p>

<p>'You must not tremble,' he assured her. 'You are safe with me.
Indeed, indeed you are. I only wish you to be the first to know
that I am leaving Mrs Golightly.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, no!' she cried, deeply distressed.</p>

<p>'I am determined, quite, quite determined. Before you came
into my life I was asleep. But now I am awake and I know that my
existence with Mrs Golightly is a sham!'</p>

<p>Oh, those poor little girls, she thought. And Mrs Golightly,
who is so happy and confident. If only she could have taken him
away and talked to him, for she liked him in spite of his
absurdities. But she did not dare to go apart with him, and here
they were besieged on all sides--people were running up and down
stairs. It was quite pandemonium.</p>

<p>'You will feel quite differently tomorrow,' she assured
him.</p>

<p>'Oh no, I shall not. You have changed my life. You have--'</p>

<p>But worse followed, for Mr Roberts appeared, carrying a glass
of punch, his red face shining with happiness, his eyes fixed
upon her as though she were already his bride.</p>

<p>Paying no attention to Mr Golightly, he caught Elizabeth's
hand, dragged her with him into the room where everyone was
valsing madly, and began to swing her round, dropping his glass
on to the floor. She thought it better not to resist lest worse
should befall.</p>

<p>'We are designed for one another!' he cried. 'It is Fate! I am
rich, you are beautiful! Let me tell them all that you will have
me! I have been waiting all my life for this moment! I am the
happiest of men! . . .' Then, before them all, suddenly, ceasing
to dance, he caught her in his stout arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>She broke from him, ran among the dancers, found her way to
the door and, on the verge of tears, half tumbled down the stairs
into the hall. At the moment there was no one there, but the
house-door was open, Alice was on the step, and beside her
someone was standing. Alice came in.</p>

<p>'It is for you, miss. A gentleman asking for you--'</p>

<p>She went forward, trying to calm her agitation. Before her,
visible enough in the pale, smoky lamp of the little hall, was
John.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was in his arms; <i>his</i> arms were round her.</p>

<p>'Oh, John--John--John,' was all she could hysterically cry.
She was sobbing on his shoulder.</p>

<p>'My love . . . my adored one . . . my only, only love!'</p>

<p>Alice was in an ecstasy. She was practical as well.</p>

<p>'Oh, miss, come into the Master's room. There's no one there.
Only the coats and hats.'</p>

<p>Into Mr Golightly's room they went, and there, among the
butterflies and beetles, John told her that he had come as
swiftly as he could and for one purpose only. At the first
possible moment they would be married.</p>

<p>'Married, John?'</p>

<p>'Yes, married, my love. We have been too ridiculous. We have
been wasting our lives.'</p>

<p>(Uhland? Her father? Oh, no matter. Let come what might!)</p>

<p>'Oh, John--I have longed for you so!'</p>

<p>'And I for you! When I received your letter . . .'</p>

<p>Mrs Golightly was in the doorway, behind her Miss Porter and
others.</p>

<p>'Mary! Why, my love . . .'</p>

<p>Elizabeth, holding John's hand, and looking more beautiful
than ever in her life before, said:</p>

<p>'Mrs Golightly--allow me to introduce you--Mr John Herries.
The gentleman to whom I am to be married. He has come all the way
from Cumberland--'</p>

<p>It was the supreme, the loveliest moment of her life.</p>

<p>MY DEAR FATHER--Yesterday morning John and I were married at
St Mary's Church, Phillamont Street, Marylebone.</p>

<p>I am afraid that this may make you angry and I am sorry indeed
that it should do so, but as you have made no inquiry after my
whereabouts I am hardened in the belief that nothing that may
happen to me can give you very great concern. I am sorry indeed
for this, but from my very earliest years you have shown me that
you would have preferred never to have had a daughter. I find it
very difficult in these unhappy circumstances to appeal to your
forgiveness because indeed I do not feel that there has been
anything on my part very blameworthy. I studied to love you, but
you wished for the love neither of my dear mother nor myself. You
are not responsible, dear father, for that. If you could not love
us you could not, but neither am I responsible for wishing to
make some kind of life for myself where I could be happy.</p>

<p>Perhaps now that I am away from you I may not cause you so
much aggravation and one day you may wish to see me again. I know
how greatly you have always disliked the family at Uldale but
they on their part have, I am sure, felt nothing but friendliness
and it is the great hope of John and myself that our marriage may
heal the division between the two families. John has some means
of his own and we shall be in no need of assistance from anyone.
Our cousins, Garth and Sylvia, are most kind, and Carey has
invited me into the country. I have written to grandfather
acquainting him with our marriage. I am afraid that grandmother
is no better.</p>

<p>With every respect, dear father. I am, Your loving
daughter,</p>

<br>


<p>MY DEAR AUNT JUDITH--Elizabeth and I were married on April
19th at twelve noon at St Mary's Church, Phillamont Street,
Marylebone.</p>

<p>Dear Aunt Judith, are you very angry with me? I did wrong
perhaps to leave you so suddenly with that brief letter of
farewell, but I am enclosing (by her own wish) Elizabeth's letter
to me that she wrote from London. Now read that and I am assured
that with all your tenderness and love of others you will not be
able to wish my actions other than they were. Indeed I could not
help myself and arrived, as it turned out, only just in time, for
my beloved Elizabeth was in the very act of escaping from an
Islington ruffian when I stepped in at the door. Can you imagine
it? She had been a Governess, having run away from her
grandfather's, to two little girls of a lady with the astounding
name of Golightly! They were kind to her, I fancy, although I
cannot force very much out of her. She was never communicative
about herself as you know.</p>

<p>But you do <i>not</i> know, dear Aunt Judith! You know one
another so slightly that it will be one of my happiest pleasures
to make you better acquainted! Seriously you have been so long
more than a mother to me (more than my own mother ever was to me
I fear) that you will, I know, rejoice in my happiness. I have
not, I think, ever been truly happy before. I have been always
apprehensive, fearing disasters that have never arrived. In the
strangest way that house at Ireby and the inhabitants in it have
hung over me like a doom. You have perceived this and thought me
often faint-hearted and absurd, I know--yet these things are of
the spirit and I have much of my poor father's lack of
self-confidence. A Herries without conceit of himself is worse
off than any other man in the world, I think! If you but knew how
often I have urged myself forward to some act that I feared
simply because I feared it! It seems to me now fantastic that I
should have so dreaded Uhland's crooked body and the coarseness
of his father--but now I have rescued Elizabeth from them, and
myself as well! Do you know how, for so many years, he neglected
and despised her and how patiently she bore that neglect? The end
of the story is not yet. I will make myself so famous that they
shall crawl on their knees to me before all is done! Now is not
that an unworthy sentiment?</p>

<p>Elizabeth has but now entered and the kettle is on the fire
and the toasting-fork ready! Our happiness is surely greater than
that of any other two in the world! And yet how many lovers are
there in this city at this same moment swearing the same thing.
But we are such old lovers and have waited so long--longer, far
longer than there was any need! How clearly I see that now!</p>

<p>My only unhappiness is that I have left you alone at
Uldale--Dorothy, Adam, myself, all gone! And yet I am not sure
that you will not be happier without us--all of us save Adam of
course! I shall be seeing him tomorrow I trust. He is all
Chartist now, I suppose, but he cannot think ill of me, for
Elizabeth and myself are as poor as church mice and happy to be
so. Sylvia came to see us last evening. She was exceedingly kind
and says that Garth will soon find work for me. There will be my
share of the Uldale money, but I would prefer that you send me
nothing--until I ask for it.</p>

<p>Elizabeth is at my side. She sends her love. As she sits
beside me I wonder what I have done to deserve this fortune. I
have done nothing. I have been a poor feckless creature all my
life but now, please God, there shall come something very
different out of me. Our love for one another is beyond
utterance. Dear Aunt Judith, wish us well and write to tell us
that you are not angry. Your loving</p>

<br>


<p>MY DEAREST SON--Your letter received last evening. I am
<i>sorry</i> indeed that you should imagine that I am not
<i>pleased</i> with your marriage. I am pleased with anything
that gives you <i>happiness</i> but I am an old woman with only
one passion left me and that is for my <i>son.</i> If you fancy
that there is any mother in the world who gives her son willingly
to <i>another woman</i> then you betray only once again that
ignorance of my sex which, I fear, has been always your portion
and will be so to the end.</p>

<p>You say that I need not fear that I shall lose you. <i>No,
indeed, I cannot lose you,</i> for you are a part of myself, more
perhaps than you will ever realize. You will return to me. You
will bring her with you, but she can never have that part of you
that is mine. You can tell her so if you wish. I am prepared to
love her for as we grow old <i>the more one can love the better
for one's health.</i> I have no <i>patience</i> with old women
who complain of being <i>left.</i> I have always been standing on
my own legs and intend to continue so. I like the name Margaret.
She sounds sensible. I enclose with this my present to her. This
silver box was left me by my brother who had it from a pedlar
when he was a boy, and the silver chain was my grandmother's. I
always intended them for your wife. Bring her soon to see me. I
am quite alone here at the present although Dorothy and the
children shall pay me a visit very shortly.</p>

<p>Bellairs is not in good health. It is his <i>stomach.</i> I am
for ever telling him that he overeats but he answers that I am
fanatical about food and eat like a <i>sparrow.</i> Certainly all
our neighbours eat and drink far too much and I attribute my own
astonishing good health to my careful feeding. Why should we
behave like swine at a trough? I remember when I was a young
woman in London that Georges had <i>incredible</i> stories of the
amount that his friends consumed and I can remember Christabel
and Jennifer in their youth guzzling like <i>pigs.</i> Well, they
are all dead and here am I feeling twenty. How I run on, but I
enjoy talking to my son who is now a Chartist and a husband and I
don't know what! Only yesterday he was pulling cows' tails in the
orchard.</p>

<p>John and Elizabeth were at poor Christabel's funeral. Will was
a very dignified figure they say. But Sylvia writes to say that a
young Mrs Morgan, widow of an Army captain, is already setting
her cap at him. Is not that revolting? He is seventy this year if
I am not mistaken, and she not a day over thirty! And what comedy
if our fat five-chinned purple-faced Walter has a baby brother, a
new uncle for our pretty Uhland! Since John left here we have had
no great trouble with Ireby.</p>

<p>Uhland spoke to me in Keswick some days back and asked most
politely after you. He has eyes like Cumberland stone and his
lame leg is as lively as a spiteful old woman. I think Walter has
no spite against myself but would do any hurt that he could to
John and Dorothy. He and Uhland have already stories circulated
in Keswick about John, and John himself seems apprehensive for in
his last letter to me he says that he fancied that he saw Uhland
looking at him out of a hackney coach. It may be that he was
right, for Uhland has been twice to London.</p>

<p>All is well at Uldale. Rackstraw manages to a <i>marvel.</i>
He is now at war with Peach, Walter's man. They detest one
another and so carry on this ridiculous feud a stage further. We
have built a new Barn in the upper field. Flossie the mare is too
old for the carriage and has been put in the Paddock. I told you
I think that Dorothy is coming shortly for a visit. You know me
well enough to understand me when I say that I do not mind at all
that I am in <i>sole</i> command here. I seem to know so very
much better than anyone else the way things <i>ought</i> to be
done. And I was sixty-five years of age last November!--Your most
loving</p>

<p>MY DEAR ADAM--The fact that you and Margaret (to whom give
every loving message from Elizabeth and myself) are at Uldale
encourages me to write a long letter, some of which I would wish
for them all to see. Other parts of it I shall mark
<i>Private</i> and they are for your ears alone.</p>

<p>Well, first to my great piece of personal news. The writer of
this Epistle has pleasure in informing you, dear Adam, that he
has been now for two days personal and private Secretary to Sir
Edward Mitcham, Bart, MP for Great Cottenham. What say you to
that and to whose services think you I owe it? To whom but to
Grandfather Will! This is, you will all at Uldale allow, a most
remarkable feat and three in the eye to my dear father-in-law and
four in the nose to my beloved brother-in-law. What they will say
to this villainous backsliding on old Will's part I have infinite
delight in imagining. It seems that I owe this as I owe every
other happiness in life to my beloved Elizabeth, for it appears
that a long while back when she was staying with him he was moved
by her loveliness and by her loneliness, coming in one evening
and seeing her all by herself and sufficiently dejected. So he
has had it in his mind for some time to do something for us and
this is what he has done.</p>

<p>Old Mitcham is a stout claret-coloured old boy who lives in
Bryanston Square with a fat wife and two plain daughters. He is
amiable enough so long as he is flattered and is saved from an
extravagant personal vanity by his adoration of Palmerston.
Palmerston can do no wrong in his eyes and already I am myself
beginning to see with a similar vision and watch the affairs in
Syria as though my life depended upon it. They say that it is the
Syrian business that has killed Lord Holland and that his dying
word was: 'Mehemet Ali will kill me'.</p>

<p>I do not know that I have any Parliamentary ambitions myself.
Elizabeth says that I would make a good orator, but she has a
certain prejudice and I am altogether too nervous and shy to
thrust myself into public notice. Meanwhile old Lady Mitcham is
quite in love with Elizabeth as indeed is all the world. Sylvia
says that she has come out amazingly and is another creature from
when she was staying with grandfather. As well she may be, for
she was at that time a lonely and deserted creature.</p>

<p>You have heard, I suppose, the gossip about grandfather. It is
certain that this Mrs Morgan is for ever in Hill Street. She is a
lively, gay, light-headed little woman, all bright colours,
tinkling laughter and sharp acquisitiveness. She already touches
everything in the house as though she owned it. I imagine myself
that grandfather would not be averse to a child in his old age,
for it is my private belief that he has suffered a long and
bitter disappointment over Walter, who pays him less and less
regard. I suggest that grandfather sees in Mrs Morgan a possible
instrument rather than a personal pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Private.</i> I have marked this Private because I should be
ashamed were anyone but yourself to see it. But you have known me
from babyhood, dear Adam, and loved me as long, I think. Listen
then, brother and friend. Elizabeth and I love one another more
dearly with every hour that passes. Our intimacy, our trust, our
devotion is perfect. And yet there <i>is</i> one thing of which
we will not speak to one another. We have both a fear, an
unreasonable, foolish, crazy fear of Uhland. That she has it I
know well. She speaks of him in her sleep and always in terror.
By the way that she so deliberately avoids his name I know that
she thinks of him. She fancies that because I married her he will
do me some hurt and still more now that grandfather has
volunteered this last kindness. Living with him so long has bred
in her a fear of him that is beyond reason and is the stronger
for its vagueness. And I must confess to you, dear Adam, that all
my old terror of him persists. How often you have chided me for
that! How foolish to your logical and consistent mind are such
fears, but I have this from my father, who had it, perhaps, from
<i>his</i> grandfather--that I live partly in a world of shadows.
For a Herries that is fatal and there are times when I feel
caught--held in a trap--and for no cause, no reason. How you must
despise me. But no, you love me and are the most faithful and
unswerving friend. Otherwise I would not have the courage to tell
you. But there is more than that. The other evening at dusk
coming from Bryanston Square I am certain that Uhland himself
followed me.</p>

<p>Walking towards the Park down a narrow and ill-lit street I
heard that tap of his stick and the hesitation of his step with
which I have been so long dreadfully familiar. For a while, I
dared myself not to turn, but at length my curiosity was too
strong for me and, looking around, I saw in the light of a lamp
the thin figure of Uhland, his dark beaver hat, pale face, black
clothes. He stood there, without moving, leaning on his stick. I
hurried on through a street now absolutely silent. He seemed to
follow me now incorporeally.</p>

<p>Pray do not laugh at me in this. Your sturdy mind cannot
imagine what such fears and terrors may be. You remain undaunted
by that other world so far more real than this one. Between the
Haunted and the Unhaunted there is a gulf that can only be
bridged by love, and I am not one who can love more than one or
two. Why does he hate me so, Adam? What have I ever done to him?
What is this strange Feud in our family that is for ever forcing
its way in?</p>

<p>But, for a moment to be practical, pray discover for me if you
can, while you are at Uldale, whether Uhland has been recently in
London. It would relieve my mind greatly if it had not been he.
Meanwhile this is the one only subject about which Elizabeth and
I do not speak. There is a shadow here, the size of a man's hand
. . .</p>

<p>But to be cheerful and <i>daylighty</i> again, pray when you
write tell me all the news of Uldale, of Aunt Judith, Roger, and
in especial Margaret and yourself. When do you return to Town?
You know that I do not think your <i>Charter</i> the cure for all
our ills but times seem to become with every week more
serious--the rick-burnings, riots and the rest--and I have little
confidence in either Melbourne or Lord John. Your loving
friend,</p>

<p>DEAR WILL--I write to congratulate you on your <i>Marriage</i>
and, with that, to be as <i>honest</i> with you as I have always
been. What do old people like you and me want with marriage?
There is something <i>indecent</i> in it, do you not yourself
think so? For you have always been the most <i>commonsensical</i>
of all our Family and I cannot believe that, sitting in a corner,
you do not laugh to yourself and wonder at your own action. You
were lonely I must suppose. Well, so indeed are all of us. What
do you say to an old woman of sixty-six sitting <i>all by
herself</i> in a house under a <i>Mountain</i> miles from
anywhere--or from <i>anyone</i> except your beastly Walter in his
stone prison? Well, have it your own way--only I refuse to tell
you that you have done a <i>fine</i> thing. If we cannot
<i>laugh</i> at ourselves we are lost souls and although your
sense of the <i>comic</i> has never been very strong in you,
still you have a certain <i>dry</i> picture of yourself I know. I
<i>trust</i> your widow will give you every <i>satisfaction.</i>
Do not think me unkind nor unfriendly, dear Will. I am neither,
and I have an especial <i>Gratitude</i> to you just now for what
you have done for dear John and Elizabeth. That was especially
noble of you seeing that your Walter hates them so (although
<i>why</i> I cannot understand. Now that poor Christabel is gone
he cannot <i>still</i> be thinking of that broken Fan). Moreover
we were <i>Babies</i> together and that I can <i>never</i> forget
although you were a dry and calculating child with a passion for
<i>sums</i> (that I always detested) from the very start. Do you
remember how you rode over to <i>Stone Ends</i> to fetch me back
home and how I snapped my fingers at you? Yes, and would do it
again if the same occasion rose. I am in marvellous health, thank
God (although I doubt whether it is His doing). Dorothy comes
with her babies to see me. She has now three <i>Girls--</i>one
born this last November--Veronica, Amabel and Jane. Timothy is
four--a fine child. Bellairs is in poor health--some disorder of
the <i>Stomach.</i></p>

<p>I must close. I am sending you a <i>Cumberland Ham</i> as a
wedding present. You have everything in the world that you need,
save only a Cumberland Ham--and there are no other Hams so good
in the world anywhere. Your most affectionate</p>

<p>MY DEAR FATHER--It is very likely that this letter will never
be posted. I am writing it at two of the morning, sitting under a
candle in my dressing gown while Adam sleeps in the bed close
behind me, sleeps so soundly as he always does, sleeps as I alas
just now so seldom do!</p>

<p>For, Father dear, that is why in the morning I shall not post
this letter, because I shall be ashamed of my mood. I am unhappy
tonight, desperately unhappy, unhappy as I have never been in my
life before. Now listen, father. I know that Adam loves me, I
know that they all wish me well here, I know that Adam is as
proud and ambitious for our work as you and I. I am well in
health and so is he. We have money enough. Best of all I have
you, dearest, dearest father--and yet tonight my courage is all
gone. I have at the moment no resistance.</p>

<p>I think perhaps that my marriage has been the most dreadful
mistake. I love Adam more, far, far more than when I married him
and I am well assured that he loves me. I think his character
noble, strong and generous. I was not mistaken in thinking it so
when I married him. But, father, I think there is no woman in
England so lonely as I am at this moment.</p>

<p>They are all so strange. This wild rough country is so
strange. Adam's mother is so strange. Adam's mother! Perhaps that
is where all the trouble lies! On my first visit here with Adam
she was, as I told you, most friendly. She wanted to love me as a
daughter, she said, and that is I know what she intended. But
love does not come like that. She was resolved to feel no
jealousy of me and in that very resolve felt it. You know how
quiet I am, father. You have always understood that I feel more
than I can say and that I cannot force myself to any feeling if
it is not there. 'Madame' (as they all call her here) is the
opposite of this. I have never said much about her to you. You
have never seen her. You cannot imagine her. She is unlike anyone
else in the world, a little tiny woman with snow-white hair, a
pale brown complexion, wearing the brightest colours, her eyes
sparkling, carrying an ivory cane, and alive in every inch of
her! I cannot convey to you how alive she is! I do not know her
exact age but it is certainly between sixty and seventy and yet
she is more living than anyone else in the neighbourhood.
Everyone knows it. Everyone recognizes it. She is a great figure
here. She is compounded of two opposites. Her mother was I
believe a gipsy and thence she has her gay colours, her
restlessness, her laughter, her generosity, her tempers, her
childlike pleasure in little things. She will dance to a
music-box tune or pick up her skirts and run down the road, or
rate a tramp like Queen Elizabeth, or play Backgammon like a
baby, kiss and stroke the cheek and love you in a passion! And on
the other hand she has a good business head, runs the house and
property like a lawyer, disciplines the servants, has her finger
in every pie.</p>

<p>But her passion is for Adam. Adam is everything to her. She
would like to possess him, every bone and vein of him, and his
soul beyond. But she is wise enough to know that she cannot and
that she can only take from him what he voluntarily gives her.
That is a great deal. They have the strongest bond, the
two--almost without knowing it, without wishing it. It is not
only a bond of mother and son but a bond of family too. All the
Herries I have met, whether in London or here, have something in
common although they are all so different. What it is I cannot
say. It is as though, inside the family, they are all against one
another, but that against the outside world they are all united.
Even Adam has something of this, although he is for ever saying
that he is illegitimate and does not belong to them and
disapproves of their worldliness and pride and materialism. For
they <i>are</i> material, grossly so <i>and</i> proud--proud with
the worst kind of English pride as though they were God's people.
John Herries in London is the only exception I have seen--yes,
and <i>part</i> of Madame. Part of <i>her</i> is non-Herries,
hates that blood and would like to escape from it.</p>

<p>In any case I am shut out, father, however kind they
<i>wish</i> to be, I am shut out. I am shut out by them all and
by this hateful hard, raining, hostile country. It is all sodden
hills and grey cloud and stone walls here. When the sun shines
everything is harder than ever. The stones have a hard face, the
people look as though they would like to kill you, the cattle
lower their heads at you. I know that it is only on visits that
we are here and that Adam will never leave his work in London,
but I am afraid lest one day his mother will win and bring him
back here for ever. He is so silent. He cannot express his
feelings at all. When I lie in his arms I know that he loves me,
but he will never say so. He is so shy of expression and when
others are there I sometimes think that he almost hates me. Of
course he does not. He is true and loving and noble, but why
cannot he say something to me once and again, only some little
things to reassure me? Then he goes off--for a whole day, leaving
me with his mother and without a word to any of us. He loves this
country so passionately that I do not count for anything beside
it. I was so happy with you, dearest father, living with you,
working with you. I needed no one. And then he came and at the
first sight I loved him with all my soul as I shall always love
him. But here I seem to fight every stone wall, every little
stream, every sulky cloud. If only he would speak to me, tell me
once that he loves me, defend me against my fears . . . Oh,
father, why . . .</p>

<p>MY DEAR SON--Dorothy and the children arrived last week. I
cannot say I am sure how this <i>experiment</i> may turn out. I
confess that I am not altogether easy in my mind. When Bellairs
died two months back Dorothy certainly had no <i>idea</i> of it,
nor had I. But she found the house more and more melancholy and
longed every day more ardently for Uldale so she must have her
way. We can but see and I admit that it is agreeable to have
company again.</p>

<p>Dorothy has grown very <i>stout</i> but is kind and much
<i>improved</i> I think. She was always <i>amiable</i> as you
know, but had a strong conviction that she must <i>manage.</i> I
have explained to her that the children are <i>her</i> business
and the house <i>mine.</i> She was at first inclined somewhat to
think me an <i>old lady.</i> She discovers that I am not so
ancient as she supposed!</p>

<p>And now, Adam, I have had a great <i>adventure.</i> I have
spent two nights in Watendlath! What do you say to that! I have
stayed in the old house, eaten at the old table, walked the old
ways. I have seen where Charlie Watson is buried and will confess
to you that I shed a <i>tear</i> or two. I have seen again my
Georges. Yes, standing by the Tarn, just as he used, smiling at
me, because he had done something that he should not, and today
was yesterday. I was a young girl again and all <i>life</i> was
in front of me. Well, that is over, my son. As I looked across
the water to the hills and down to Rosthwaite where your
grandfather lived, I knew what I had <i>thrown away</i> when I
remained at Uldale. I sold my <i>soul</i> perhaps that day but
what does it matter? There are too many souls already in space
for the loss of one little one to be of importance.</p>

<p>Alice Perry's son reigns and a fine fellow he is, with four
fine <i>children.</i> His wife I thought a poor feckless creature
and her <i>hodge-podge</i> a disgrace, but for once I kept my old
tongue quiet and told her only <i>compliments.</i> For an hour I
was <i>wild</i> again, old woman though I am. But the wildness
passed. Here I am at my table adding accounts and the cows are
going to milking beyond the window and Skiddaw is as mild and
stout as Dorothy herself.</p>

<p>They all thought me <i>mad</i> to go. I have still a touch of
madness, but it diminishes. Rackstraw has the <i>gout,</i>
Mary--the new maid (from Cockermouth--a good girl)--the
toothache, her face swollen twice its size. I shall never see
Watendlath again.</p>

<p>I <i>long</i> to have you here. It seems to be the <i>only
thing</i> I live for now, but I will not force you. You will come
in your own good time. I passed Walter in the road last week. We
did not speak. He is <i>immensely</i> fat and is not as careful
in his dress as he was. There are awful doings at Ireby from all
I hear, and many people refuse to go there any longer. I hear
that he vows vengeance on us all because John and dear Elizabeth
are happy in London--a poor sort of reason--but he cannot harm
us. Give my love to Margaret. I am sending you some of my own
<i>Preserves,</i> two <i>Hams</i> and a <i>wool-work ottoman</i>
that I bought at old Mr Chancey's sale in Keswick as a present to
Margaret. Your loving</p>

<p>MY DEAREST MOTHER--This must be only the briefest of notes as
I go this afternoon to a meeting in Manchester, but I thought you
would like to know how we find our new rooms.</p>

<p>We think them exceedingly comfortable when we have time to
consider them. I was never before as busy as now. People are
still talking of Peel's Income-Tax and we Chartists will most
certainly not oppose it. It is a small step in our own direction
but the state of the country is with every week worse and the
conditions among the poor frightful.</p>

<p>We have seen none of our relations save John and Elizabeth. I
am happy to say that Elizabeth and Margaret have become the
greatest friends. I am most happy for that. Margaret has not been
so well of late.</p>

<p>In great haste. Your loving son,</p>

<h1><a name="c206">HOMECOMING IN WINTER</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The little town shivered under the breath of the helm-wind
that, beating down from the icy caverns and hollows of Helvellyn,
threw dark quivering shadows of cloud on the garden walls, set
Main Street trembling with a half-worshipping, half-shuddering
agitation, and caused Mrs Constantine, who had Mrs Trevelyan of
Bournemouth as guest, to rub the tip of her nose with her muff a
hundred times.</p>

<p>Fortunately at this moment of English history ladies were, by
the dictates of fashion, more warmly clad than at any time before
or after. So many petticoats, with solid padding, indeed did they
wear that the crinoline must come in very shortly and assist
them. Mrs Constantine was wearing four petticoats, and her
poke-bonnet was lined with fur. Her peaked and animated face was
for ever hiding itself in an enormous snowy muff. But it was
right that it should be cold. Mrs Constantine, wife of one of the
doctors in Keswick, told Mrs Trevelyan (whose heart, if the truth
were known, was sick for Bournemouth) that it was right that it
should be cold. She exulted in it, she revelled in it. It was but
a week before Christmas and what was Christmas if not cold? The
coach rattled down the street, old Tom Rawson blowing his horn
with a fine Christmas flourish. The boys were just out of school
and, wrapped up almost to the eyes in mufflers, rushed along the
street screaming like sea-birds, playing 'shinny' as they went,
the wooden ball lathe-turned, the 'shinny' sticks cut from the
hedges. Keswick was its own quiet self in these winter months,
lying peacefully beneath the purple wind-scarred hills. In the
summer, as Mrs Constantine explained, it was now 'the rage',
college youths from Cambridge, every house letting lodgings, the
pencil-makers selling to every visitor enough black-lead pencils
to last a lifetime; spar-dealers, curiosity-mongers, boatmen
making a fortune; coaches tearing in and out, picnics everywhere,
and until lately Mr Southey to be seen at any time, taking his
walk. Poor gentleman, nothing but tragedy now. So many things to
see! So <i>many</i> things to see! . . . But now all is quiet.
Soon sheep, their wool blown a little by the wind, move up the
street, the boys with their 'shinny' sticks racing in and out
among them, there is a sudden flash of sun from the wrack of
cloud, piercing like a sword drawn from its scabbard the cobbles,
the sheep, the boys, slashing into sudden colour the cold flanks
of Blencathra.</p>

<p>But Mrs Constantine was historical. History was her passion.
Oh, Keswick was full of history! There was Acorn Street where the
Royal Oak had been (oak--acorn--did Mrs Trevelyan see the
quaintness?) and the Friars Inn where Lord Derwentwater quaffed a
flagon of ale before riding to the '15, and Crosthwaite Vicarage
where the tithes--the wool, the pigs, the geese, the dairy
produce--were brought and a grand dinner with hodge-podge
followed. Here Mrs Trevelyan sneezed.</p>

<p>'You are not chill, my dear, I trust?'</p>

<p>'Oh no, not at all, not at all--'</p>

<p>And the old Moot Hall and the--Here she broke off to
murmur:</p>

<p>'My dear Eliza! This is most fortunate. Here coming towards us
is the most interesting person in Keswick.'</p>

<p>Mrs Trevelyan, blinded by the sharp wind and knowing that she
had caught a cold that would endure for weeks, stared a little
uncertainly.</p>

<p>But there was no doubt as to whom Mrs Constantine intended,
for, stepping out of a barouche, standing for a moment, resting
on a cane and looking about, then slowly walking up the street
towards them, was a most remarkable woman. She was small of
figure, but her step was astonishingly alert. She carried her
head as though she commanded the town. As she approached them
more nearly Mrs Trevelyan saw that her hair was snow-white under
her poke-bonnet, that was of a rich blue and decorated with a
feather. She wore a purple silk mantlet trimmed with a shaded
ribbon. She was distinguished, most dainty, most determined. Her
hands were hidden in a purple muff. She tapped with her cane, she
looked about her eagerly, as though she were sniffing the
fragrant, frosty air. Some boys with their ball, racing up the
street, slowed down as they saw her. She smiled benignly upon
them. A gentleman, riding a splendid roan, touched his hat. She
bowed like a queen. A bearded farmer, driving a cow, touched his
hat and she bowed again. She arrived at the two ladies.</p>

<p>'Oh Mrs Constantine, how <i>do</i> you do?'</p>

<p>'Very well indeed, thank you, Madame Paris. Will you permit me
to introduce to you my friend, Mrs Trevelyan, from
Bournemouth.'</p>

<p>'With the greatest pleasure . . . I hope you are well? You are
paying a lengthy visit?'</p>

<p>Here Mrs Trevelyan unfortunately sneezed and was so deeply
aggravated that instead of paying compliments, as she had
intended, she could only stutter:</p>

<p>'The air in Bournemouth is more balmy--'</p>

<p>'It is indeed. But here, I fancy, it is more bracing. I am on
my way to visit old Miss Pennyfeather. She has not been so well,
you know. Pray, remember me to the Doctor, Mrs Constantine. If
you would be so good . . .'</p>

<p>She moved on.</p>

<p>'A most remarkable woman,' said Mrs Constantine eagerly. 'They
say her mother was a gipsy. She has a house at Uldale and is a
relation of the Herries family. Her father was a Herries--long
ago here in Keswick. She has had a most remarkable history--'</p>

<p>They passed on to the more sheltered side of the street, but
not before Mrs Trevelyan, who felt her chill gaining upon her
with every cut of the wind, had remarked: 'She appears to enjoy
most excellent health. I never saw such spirits!'</p>

<p>No, indeed. She had not and she would not, for Judith was at
the height of happiness. This evening, by the Lancaster Coach,
Adam her son was arriving for the Christmas festivities. Adam was
coming home. She had not seen him for nearly a year; he was
bringing his wife with him and that was very pleasant, but for
Judith no one and nothing mattered but Adam.</p>

<p>She was in splendid health. This wild wind, these steel-grey
hills suited her. She was exalted, lifted up. Between a break in
the wall, over a dry and wind-tossed garden, she could see the
distant Lake, the small waves in feathered hurry racing before
the tongue of the flicking air. Were her hands not so warmly in
the purple muff she could have stretched them out and embraced it
all--sky, hill, water, stone and tree. The freshness, the
strength, the flashing scornful sun! Snow was in the air! Snow!
And Adam was coming home, Adam was coming home. She saw Dr
Constantine, very thin-waisted, in his high beaver hat, riding
his cob. She bowed. He bowed. It was all she could do not to give
a little hop, skip and jump for sheer joy of living! Adam was
coming home! Even as she rapped Miss Pennyfeather's knocker she
gathered him to her heart, felt herself lost in his embrace, knew
once again that neither wife nor work could take him from her. He
was yet in her womb!</p>

<p>Little Nancy, Miss Pennyfeather's treasure, opened the door to
her and she was in the parlour. It remained unchanged through all
these years just as the rooms at Uldale remained unchanged,
although Dorothy was for ever talking of 'new furniture'. New
furniture! Judith detested the great ugly, heavy, clumsy stuff
such as you saw at the Osmastons' or the Applebys'. No, this
delicacy was what she loved and her eye rested with gratitude on
dear Miss Pennyfeather's blue Chinese wallpaper, the nodding
mandarins on the mantelpiece, the delicate harpsichord with its
painting of violets on the lid, and the pretty delicate chairs
with their faded gilt. But she did not look for more than a
moment, for there, dancing from foot to foot in front of Miss
Pennyfeather, who was sunk deep in an armchair and all wrapped up
in shawls, was the strangest figure!</p>

<p>He was an odd little man, scarcely five feet high, his head on
one side as though he had a crick in his neck, his shoulders
humped; he had (Judith saw at once and recognized from olden
days) the most marvellous eyes, dark, luminous, living every life
in their orbs, at one moment enraged, at another amazed, at a
third delighted, at a fourth swimming in fun. He had long white
locks, unbrushed, dishevelled, and they seemed to have a breath
of their own as they moved. He was wearing a blue-lapelled
swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, two waistcoats, a black
stock and a high white collar above it. As Judith came in upon
him he was dancing round like a top, his white hair waving, and
nursing in his arms two white kittens, while Miss Pennyfeather's
spaniel, Bonaparte, barked at his heels. Yes, Judith knew at once
who he was! Back, without a moment's interval, to that afternoon
at Southey's when, her heart sore and indignant at Jennifer's
unkindness, that boy with the flashing eyes had broken in . . .
and now . . . this old man . . . and she . . . She had never seen
him between then and now . . .</p>

<p>She bent down and kissed Miss Pennyfeather. Then she held out
her hand.</p>

<p>'Mr Hartley Coleridge! You will not remember me . . . And,
indeed, of course, you cannot. It is--oh, I fear to say how many
years! I was a young woman, you a boy, tea at Mr Southey's . .
.'</p>

<p>He did not remember her in the least, but he put down the
kittens and held her hand and looked into her eyes with his own
lambent ones and pretended that he remembered her perfectly well.
They stood together, hand in hand, much of a height.</p>

<p>'Remember you! Why, of course, dear lady, of course, of
course. Hey-diddle-diddle, but that is a long time ago--sad
things, many sad things since then. So many gone, so many failing
of high hopes. But we won't be sad. We refuse to be sad. I can
see that you are never sad. We are like these kittens, you and I.
Here--the reel of cotton--I have lost it. Here, help me!' He was
down on his knees searching under the harpsichord.</p>

<p>He looked up pleadingly at Miss Pennyfeather.</p>

<p>'Claribella, Isabella, Rosamunda--may I request a glass of
beer?'</p>

<p>She looked at him sternly, then shook her head at him.</p>

<p>He sat back on the floor, his hand on a kitten's back.</p>

<p>'Well, a glass of water then.'</p>

<p>She pulled the bell-rope.</p>

<p>Then he was on his feet again. He danced about the room,
talking all the time.</p>

<p>'Willie and Nannie Coates; you know, Lord and Lady Bacon
because they kept so many pigs . . . They used to say . . . And
Dinah Fleming--dear, dear Dinah--and you know the Mr Briggs and
the Branckens and the Hustlers--at Tail End. Oh, you know them
all, Claribella, and love them, and we'll go together! We'll pay
calls together! We'll go round in a gig drawn by a goat all set
up with lanterns. We'll stop on Dunmail and have goat's milk and
I'll write a poem . . .'</p>

<p>He caught up the kitten, held it in front of him
murmuring,</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our birth and death alike are mysteries,<br>
 And thou, sweet babe, art a mysterious thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Jeanette,' he murmured. 'That was to Jeanette.'</p>

<p>He almost ran to the door. 'I must be away! Off! Gone!
Vanished!'</p>

<p>He ran back and, with the utmost tenderness and delicacy, bent
down and kissed the very old lady in the chair.</p>

<p>'Perhaps for the last time, Claribella, Rosamunda,' he said.
'Who knows but that beer may finish me one of these warm, spidery
days?'</p>

<p>He stood in front of Judith and smiled so enchanting, engaging
a smile that there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>'You saw me last,' he said, 'as a boy with everything in front
of me. Now I can leap a brook and dance a hornpipe--not bad for
an old man.'</p>

<p>He bent forward, kissed her hand, went to the door, bowed to
both of them and was gone.</p>

<p>To Judith, his appearance, so unexpected, so brief, was the
most extraordinary omen. He had been that to her on the only
other occasion that she had met him. It had been then as though
they had known one another always, sharing some secret life
private to themselves. It had been so then. It was so now. All
that he had lost, all that she had lost, rushed to her heart. She
stared at the closed door as though it concealed a mystery. Then
she recovered herself and was busy in cheering her old friend,
who now was paralysed, whose doom was upon her, whose spirits
were as brave and cheerful as those of the kittens that played
with the ends of her shawl.</p>

<p>'Oh! He never had his glass of water!' Judith cried.</p>

<p>'Nancy will give it him. He is an old friend of Nancy's. He is
with her in the kitchen now, chucking her under the chin. But she
knows that she is never to give him beer--that I shall never
forgive her if she does.'</p>

<p>Miss Pennyfeather lay back exhausted, her hands helpless, the
yellow skin drawn sheath-like over the ridge of bones, only her
eyes brave, defiant and amused. For an hour or more Judith made
her happy.</p>

<p>'I enjoy seeing you so cheerful, my dear.'</p>

<p>'I enjoy it myself. But Adam is coming. I have not seen him
this year.'</p>

<p>'And his wife?'</p>

<p>Yes.'</p>

<p>'You should bring her to see me one day. I am curious. You
don't care for her.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I do!' Judith shrugged her shoulders. 'Or I would. If
she'd let me. She is a great calm, quiet woman. All the same I
think she is a little afraid of me.'</p>

<p>Miss Pennyfeather said nothing.</p>

<p>'And you know that I am never my best with anyone who is
afraid of me.'</p>

<p>'Now, Judith.' Miss Pennyfeather's eyes sought the other's
very seriously. 'We have been the greatest friends for many
years, have we not? Well, then, I can speak my mind. You must be
good and generous to Adam's wife. Any other way lies catastrophe.
Make her love you.'</p>

<p>'I have tried.'</p>

<p>'Yes--with reservations. "I will love you," you have said, "if
you recognize that I come first with my son."' Then suddenly,
with an odd galvanic energy: 'Possessive love--I detest it.'</p>

<p>Judith bent over her friend.</p>

<p>'Very well, dearest . . . You are right. I will make Margaret
love me.' She laid her warm white hand on the dead yellow
one.</p>

<p>After a pause Miss Pennyfeather said:</p>

<p>'There is another thing, my dear. Gossip. They come in here
and gossip although I tell them not to. Is it true that you are
having John and Elizabeth for Christmas?'</p>

<p>'Yes. And Sylvia and Garth Herries also. They are coming down
from Edinburgh.'</p>

<p>'Look out, then, for trouble from Mr Walter. I hear that he is
enraged beyond all measure that you should have John and
Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>'Why should I not have them?'</p>

<p>'After his casting Elizabeth off--and after John marrying
Elizabeth. Oh, my dear, you are not as a rule so slow!'</p>

<p>'Yes . . . I see. Well, I am not afraid of him.'</p>

<p>'They say that young Osmaston and Fred Kelly and others are
always at the Fortress--card-playing, drinking . . . Gossip. But
no decent person goes to the Fortress any more.'</p>

<p>Judith smiled.</p>

<p>'I told Walter years ago that he could not do it. From the
moment he laid the first stone of that building everything has
gone wrong with him. Jennifer's ghost haunts him. And Uhland's
ingratitude. And now his father's marriage . . . Do you know that
old Will may be a father any day now?'</p>

<p>'Never!' cried Miss Pennyfeather.</p>

<p>'Yes, and he is seventy-two years old. Well, my father was the
same. They are strong men, the Herries . . . Goodbye, my dear. I
shall be in again very shortly and shall bring Adam's wife with
me.'</p>

<p>When Judith was in the barouche again and turning towards home
the afternoon was already gathering in. A pallid bar of shuttered
light lay between heavy clouds above Skiddaw. The wind had died,
but little sobbing breaths rose and fell among the bare trees.
The hills were cold, clothed in an ashen shadow, and over the
long, thin fields a chill, hard and remorseless, laid its hand. A
few hesitating flakes of snow were already falling.</p>

<p>Halfway along Bassenthwaite they approached a horseman and, in
the half-light, Judith saw that it was Walter. She would have had
old Bennet drive past him, but Walter, at once recognizing her
carriage, rode his horse in front and across it. Bennett pulled
up the horses and Walter came close, laying his gloved hand on
the back of Judith's seat. She had not spoken with him for over
two years.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Judith,' he said.</p>

<p>His voice was thick and husky. Now that he was close to her
she could see the gross double-chinned face, the purple veins in
nose and cheeks, the little eyes half closed under the heavy
lids. He was very large in his riding-coat. He towered above her.
He looked rather pathetic, she thought, and she was not in the
least afraid of him.</p>

<p>'Good evening, Walter.'</p>

<p>'I shall not detain you a moment,' he went on, turning to
curse his horse that it did not keep still. 'I have only a
question to ask.'</p>

<p>'And what is that? We shall have snow, I fancy.'</p>

<p>'Yes. My question is not about the weather.'</p>

<p>He leaned closer to her, and his breath was coarse and
hot.</p>

<p>'Is it true, as I hear, that you are entertaining my daughter
at Uldale this Christmas?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly true.'</p>

<p>'You are aware that she disobeyed me flagrantly and that by
entertaining her you are insulting me before the whole
countryside?'</p>

<p>His voice quivered and again she thought: 'Poor Walter!'</p>

<p>'Now, Walter, this is a cold, chilly moment to discuss such a
matter. I shall invite whom I please to my house.'</p>

<p>His big hand quivered on the board.</p>

<p>'Then you must take the consequences,' he said very low.</p>

<p>'I can look after myself--and my guests.'</p>

<p>'Well--I have warned you.'</p>

<p>She rested her hand for a moment on his.</p>

<p>'Come, Walter. This is foolishness. Forgive Elizabeth. Pay us
a visit. Let us slay this stupid feud that has lasted so long.
Hatred never did any good.'</p>

<p>He shouted: 'By God, No! . . . By God, No!'--dug spurs into
his horse and charged away down the road.</p>

<p>Old Bennett drove on. His broad back (shoulders now bent and
round) represented his proper emotions. He served Madame. If
anyone did her a hurt, he would see to it. But words--words break
no windows. That Herries of Ireby was crazed, and the way, so
they said, that he carried on with women was shameful. Bennett,
with all the virtue and fidelity of the unimaginative, scornfully
flicked his horses' ears.</p>

<p>Judith was only for a moment perturbed. It had been strange,
that dual recurrence of little Coleridge and of Walter--her past
breaking in. But as she grew older she found that past, present
and future began to merge. Time was becoming of less and less
importance. There were these facts: her visit with Warren to
Rosthwaite, the awful birth in Paris, Adam the baby teasing
Walter on his white horse, Reuben as he fell mortally wounded in
the lighted garden, Jennifer crying 'They've begun to build!
They've begun to build!' or, long long ago, a beautiful naked
woman and a young man on his knees, old Uncle Tom and Emma
sitting by the fire at Stone Ends, David dropping, as though a
stone had struck him, on the bright green grass, Georges throwing
her out of bed at Watendlath, Georges falling, falling while the
Old Man with the white beard . . . She looked up through the
trees to the dark sky. All these things had occurred together, at
the same moment of time, and meant but this--that they had been
signs to light Judith Paris the way to salvation--and she had not
gone . . . There was somewhere a Door . . . and somewhere a Key .
. . and all History, whether of Nations or Families, was but this
. . . Have you found it? Are you in touch? Have you made the
Connexion? . . .</p>

<p>She sat back, drawing her mantlet more closely about her. No,
they meant but this, all these shining moments, these figures
woven into her tapestry--that she adored her son Adam, that he
was coming home tonight, and her head would for a moment rest on
his breast, that they would be together, together . . .</p>

<p>Her heart began to beat so that she must lay her muff against
it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The house was alight with candles. They had not gas yet,
although Dorothy was always urging it Judith refused. Candles and
lamps. This gas hurt the eyes. It was dangerous. And how pretty
the candleshine against the Chinese wallpaper, or lighting you up
the twisted stair.</p>

<p>'How modern you are!' she said, pinching Dorothy's fat cheek.
Then added: 'I shall be gone soon. Then you may have gas.'</p>

<p>She was managing very well with Dorothy, who had grown in
experience as well as in physical size. She was now a great woman
with big breasts and wide beam and a face like a dairy-maid.
Having children had taught her a deal; she managed them well.
They obeyed her, indeed, better than they obeyed their Great-aunt
Judith, as they were taught to call her. Timothy was a normal
lively boy already like his father. The three little
girls--Veronica, Amabel and Jane--were docile, happy-natured.
Veronica was the pretty one. She had dimples and dark hair like
her grandmother's. Yes, they were good children.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock the whole house quivered with excitement. For
one thing, with the coming of Adam and Margaret the stir of the
Christmas festivities might be said to commence. John and
Elizabeth were arriving tomorrow, Sylvia and Garth Herries two
days later. Christmas Night there was to be a dance. The children
could scarcely contain themselves, and the little girls were
busy, secretly, all day long, painting, sewing, cutting out,
making their presents.</p>

<p>Adam and Margaret would take a post-chaise from Kendal, so one
could not be sure when they would arrive. Judith walked all over
the candlelit house, seeing that everything was right. She pushed
open a window a moment and listened to the bell-ringers
practising at the church a mile and a half away. She could hear
the running water, and felt, with a thrill of contrasted warmth,
the cold dark paths running up the mountain-sides, the gullies
down whose flanks the wind was tearing. One cold flutter, then
another, touched her cheeks. It was snowing.</p>

<p>She lingered especially in the room where Adam and Margaret
would sleep. This had been Jennifer's. Here Francis had surprised
Jennifer, here Jennifer had lain while John read to her and the
reflection of the flames that the rioters had lighted danced on
the walls. Yes, everything was well. The four-poster was ready,
there were flowers (Christmas roses) on the davenport, the
stamped fleur-de-lis wallpaper looked fine in the candlelight.
Dorothy would like tall pier-glasses and grates of shining steel
and heavy cornices. Not while Judith was in command! She came out
and stood at the top of the stairs, holding a candle and
listening. The house was very still, only the ticking of the
clocks, a door opening and closing. Stillness, peace. A great
wave of thankfulness flowed over her. She had not done so badly
then. After all the turmoil of her life it had come to
this--that, hale in health, honoured and trusted, in this old
house that she loved, she stood there waiting for her son whom,
by wise dealing, she had kept in her heart. She smiled to
herself, thinking of the moment when, in that room close to her,
he had defied her. He had climbed out of the window just as she
had once done. Bone of her bone, flesh of her flesh . . .</p>

<p>The bell pealed through the house. The knocker shook the door.
They were here, they were here!</p>

<p>She ran down the stairs, across the hall, flung open the door,
was out on the paved path. Bennett and the boy had come from the
stable with lanterns and all the dogs with them, barking,
yelling, yelping. And there beyond the gates, like a visitant
from another ghostly country, was the post-chaise. A moment later
Judith was in her son's arms.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Margaret stood alone in the bedroom,
hesitating to blow out the candles before she went down. Adam had
already preceded her. She stood there beating down her fear. She
saw herself in the glass, her image flickering uncertainly in the
blown candlelight. Yes, she was tall, broad, plain; clear
straight eyes, dark hair brushed carefully, cleanly, strong,
but--dull! Oh, dull, dull, dull! And this little woman with all
her oddity, liveliness, sharpness would find her with every visit
more dull.</p>

<p>It was all she could do to keep the tears back from her eyes.
The journey had been very long, the train stinking of oil from
the ill-trimmed lamps, the last drive in the chaise chill and
rough. She was terribly weary. Had she had her way she would have
gone to bed, then and there, and slept for a night and day, but
Madame would think that weak and foolish.</p>

<p>'What! A strong woman like Margaret! What a wife for my
son!'</p>

<p>And Adam--why had he not <i>felt</i> her isolation, dread,
loneliness? Her father would have known in an instant what she
was feeling, but Adam seemed to have no intuition. Oh! he loved
her, of course! But he never seemed to wish to tell her so. She
scolded herself here as she had already done a thousand times.
What was this need in her for reassurance? It had not been so
before her marriage. She and her father had never spoken about
their love. But Adam was so strange. Even now, after their years
of marriage, she did not understand him. Perhaps no one
understood him except his mother. He would escape from her--at
any moment. At one time he was there, and then, in a second, he
was gone! And it never occurred to him to suit himself to her
mood, to ask what <i>she</i> was thinking! Maybe all Englishmen
were like that! It was her German blood that made her <i>ask</i>
for sentiment, sympathy, little loving words and actions. At
night, in the dark, his heart beating against her heart, her arm
around him as though he were her child--ah, then he was hers! But
why with the first flash of daylight must he cease all
demonstration as though he were afraid of the light? Oh, these
Englishmen--but they were difficult as husbands!</p>

<p>He was downstairs now with his mother, and here was she
trembling at the smell and feel of this hostile house, at the
thought of the dark cold hills that closed it in, at the
anticipation of that little woman with her sharp eyes, her way of
suddenly looking at you as though she wondered that you
<i>could</i> be such a fool!</p>

<p>Well, she must fight it. Adam was so happy to come home. She
must make him think that she was happy too.</p>

<p>She came down and found them as she had expected, in the
parlour seated on the sofa with the roses (Margaret <i>hated</i>
that sofa), Madame's white sharp hand resting on Adam's broad
knee with so proprietary an air!</p>

<p>Adam jumped up.</p>

<p>'Come here, my dear,' said Judith, patting the sofa. 'I am
sure that you must be tired. Come and sit beside me.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Margaret, feeling large and awkward and
clumsy in all her limbs. 'I am not tired at all, thank you.'</p>

<p>She sat down beside her. There was a pause then, as though
Margaret had interrupted a very intimate conversation. Then
Judith continued again the excited narration of people and events
that she had been pouring on to Adam before Margaret's
entrance.</p>

<p>Then Dorothy came in, red-faced, smiling, her corsage of
puckered taffeta too tight for her figure, her hair a trifle
untidy. Margaret liked Dorothy. She was kind and
unalarming--somehow rather German.</p>

<p>They went in to supper. How happy Adam was! Margaret's heart
ached with love of him as she watched him across the table. He
was like a small boy again, asking about everything, the dogs,
the horses, the cows, the dairy, Dorothy's children, all the
neighbours. He had forgotten, she saw, all his distress about the
poor, the Corn Laws and the rest--the things that would make him
so unhappy in London that he would walk the room, tossing his
head, beating his hands against one another, crying out . . .</p>

<p>She saw, too, Judith's happiness, how the small lady, sitting
so straight at the head of the table, was almost breathless with
happiness at having her son home again. How excitable she was at
her age, what a child still in many ways! She would rap out an
order to the parlour-maid like a general addressing a soldier,
and then in a moment would forget it all and clap her hands at
some joke, or throw to one of the four dogs--that sat with
staring eager eyes near her chair--something from the table, or
laugh at Rackstraw. And once she jumped up and walked, strutting
with an affected gait to show them the absurdity of some old man
in Keswick.</p>

<p>'Yes,' thought Margaret, 'what a poor creature I am to grudge
them their happiness in being together! I will win her heart,
make her love me.' But the words would not come. She could only
answer in monosyllables. Some reserve stuck in her throat. 'Oh,
what a fool and a spoil-sport they must think me!' she cried to
herself.</p>

<p>After supper, the Waits came. First they could be heard behind
the closed windows, faint shrill voices and the sudden plaintive
squeak of a fiddle. They were summoned into the hall and stood
there in a semi-circle--three boys, an old man with a white
beard, a stout countryman in a smock, and a thin tall man with
spectacles who was the fiddler. The servants came to listen. The
dogs sat solemnly on their haunches in a group, yawning once and
again.</p>

<p>The boys sang in piercing trebles while the old bearded man
had one of the deepest voices, surely, in the world. They sang
their carols without fear or hesitation, looking at no one but
holding their heads up and staring into the ceiling with a kind
of ecstatic frenzy. When it was over they were given money and
hot drinks. They vanished into the night, and a flurry of snow
blew in through the open door.</p>

<p>Afterwards they sat around the blazing fire in the parlour
talking, listening to the wind that had sprung up and now was
howling round the house.</p>

<p>When they all went up to bed Adam followed his mother into her
room. When the door was closed she held him in her arms as though
she would never let him go.</p>

<p>They sat down close together at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>'It has been a long time, Adam.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mother, I know. It is not easy. There is so much to
do.'</p>

<p>'Are you happy?' She looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>'Happy? Who is happy?'</p>

<p>'Then you are not. Why not?'</p>

<p>He stared, under frowning brows, into the fire.</p>

<p>'The state of the country is dreadful. Never been so bad. No
employment, trade fearful, no faith in Parliament, living
conditions frightful--and everyone helpless. What is coming,
Mother? Surely something disastrous.'</p>

<p>She put her arm around him, and he his around her.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said. 'But I know something about life now. Nothing
is so bad as you expect.'</p>

<p>'No. Perhaps.' He hesitated. 'I come in for a good deal of
criticism, Mother. Many of them think me priggish, snobbish, out
for my own hand. It was a shock the first time that I realized
it. I had thought that I was so genuine, really moved by the love
of my fellowmen, truly believing in them. And then when I heard
myself called a self-seeker I was miserable for a while. I
allowed no one to see it--not Margaret even--but I thought,
"Well, perhaps I am this. I am deceived in myself." There's a
little man, rather a power in London, he believes in nothing and
in nobody. He says frankly that if you say that you love your
fellowmen or trust your friends you are a hypocrite. He hates and
despises me. I know the sort of picture he draws of me behind my
back, amiable, filled with noble sentiments, but a snob because I
am a Herries and making my own career under a cloak of caring for
others. Yes, I was unhappy for a while--so long as I thought it
might be true. But it is <i>not</i> true. There is something in
me stronger and deeper than my intentions or my words or my acts.
I <i>do</i> believe in my fellowmen, I <i>do</i> love them. I
know that most of them intend the best. I know that Henry Cray is
wrong with his bitterness and cynical mind. I have ceased to
disturb myself. I am tranquil again.'</p>

<p>'Yes.' She drew his hand into hers.</p>

<p>'That is hard--the first time you really see yourself as your
detractors see you. But it is grand too. At last you are seeing
the whole picture. You are a spectator of yourself. That happened
to me years ago in this very house, when Jennifer hated me. I
could not <i>believe</i> that anyone could see me as that--mean,
sly, intriguing. But only those who love you know you. There is
good criticism, though, in the view of your detractors. You take
yourself too seriously, Adam, I don't doubt. Pompous,
sentimental! No, you are not, but you think perhaps too much of
nobility and fine living. Life's a magpie's hoard--an occasional
gold piece quite by accident among the broken glass and bits of
coal. Take life lightly, my son. Believe in it, but laugh at it
and at yourself.'</p>

<p>He kissed her. 'Later on. I'm too solemn, I know. I am always
feeling it. But I live so much by myself, in my own thoughts . .
.'</p>

<p>'And Margaret?' she asked him.</p>

<p>'I think I love Margaret more every day--but I don't grow
closer to her. She wants something from me. I don't know what it
is. Something I cannot give her. I have never been able to say in
words what I feel. I'm tongue-tied. It seems to threaten my
freedom if I speak too much. She is very quiet, too, of course.
We are both too quiet together perhaps.'</p>

<p>'I am going to make Margaret love me this Christmas-time,'
Judith said. 'She is lonely, Adam, and she loves you more than
anyone else ever has--except myself.'</p>

<p>'You and she, Kraft, and John,' Adam said slowly, 'the four in
my life who have loved me. But for the most part men cannot come
close to me. I used to dream of helping to make a great
Brotherhood in England. Now I know that I never shall. I am not
the man.'</p>

<p>'No,' she answered. 'Maybe you are not. It is not for us to
choose what we shall be. We have to accept and without
protest.'</p>

<p>She kissed him most lovingly, and he went to his wife.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c207">THE WILD GOOSE</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The wild goose, the same bird that Orlando was afterwards to
see, flew over the house as the light was just breaking. The
whirr of its wings stirred the perfect stillness of the crystal
scene. The early sun was dim, but a pale glitter showed every
tree and blade of grass sparkling with crystal. The whiteness of
the snow, even in that thin light, dazzled the eye.</p>

<p>The sun rose higher--the wild goose was gone--the sheathed
snow, stretching in a translucent glory to the line where Skiddaw
cut the sky, now faintly blue, ran to the very foundations of the
house and was marked only by the tiny feet of birds.</p>

<p>They were all going to church--Madame, Adam, Margaret,
Elizabeth, John, Sylvia, Garth, Dorothy, Veronica, Amabel,
Timothy, Jane, Rackstraw, Bennett, old Mrs Quinney, Martha
Hodgson, Jack Turner, Alice, Clara, Wilson, Mrs Wilson. Nearly
two miles to the church. Some had walked ahead, some were
driving, all the dogs had gone charging across the field, little
clouds of shining iridescent powder rose up above the purple
shadows that darkened the snow.</p>

<p>John and Elizabeth walked.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm so happy!' said John. 'This is the loveliest
Christmas!' But was he speaking truly, for over his head,
frowning down upon him, was the Fortress? It looked sardonically
threatening with its battlements and turrets; the walls met above
the hill like a great hanging eyebrow; the stone was dull, heavy,
squat, but snow fell in a sheet of dazzling light from its grey
shoulders and it could not disown, however it might wish, the
blue peerless sky that overlooked it. Light struck the walls and
the preen of the two peacocks that Walter had bought. They
stretched their tails on the miniature battlements.</p>

<p>'Is not Aunt Judith wonderful?' said John.</p>

<p>'I love her so much,' said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She thought that it must be impossible to be happier than she
was at that moment. And perhaps--who knows?--she would meet her
father in the road, all would be forgiven, he would come to the
Christmas party . . .</p>

<p>Was that, John thought, Uhland sitting his black horse under
the yews? There! There! Cannot you see? His heart was chilled.
No. There is no one there . . .</p>

<p>They were approaching the church, and the bells were ringing
like mad. The quire were in a small gallery and were almost
throttled with evergreens, holly and ivy and mistletoe. There was
fiddler and a clarionet. The young ladies in delightful bonnets,
some small boys shining with soap, the village postmaster, Mr
Collins, Farmer Twistle, Farmer Donne, young Donne--they all
played and sang with such a vigour that some of the holly fell
with a rattle and clatter from the old beam. There was an anthem
in which all the parts went wrong and nobody cared. Two of the
dogs from the Hall--Satan and Mischief--strolled up the aisle and
pushed with their noses at the door of Madame's high-walled pew.
Then they lay down, their tongues hanging out, their eyes fixed
in front of them. How everyone sang 'Oh, Come, all ye Faithful'!
. . .</p>

<p>In the churchyard afterwards, old Mr Summers, the Vicar, stood
and shook hands with everybody.</p>

<p>They all walked home, and it was passing through the second
field that one of the important events of Adam's life occurred to
him. He was to remember afterwards, with a rich sense of
gratitude, that shiny expanse of snowy field, and how in the
sunlight the snow turned to rills of sparkling water that
glittered through the grass, and how over the hedge Sam
Longford's cottage that he knew so well sent up a banner of
purple smoke that fluttered against the stainless sky.</p>

<p>For a thick-set, broad-shouldered man, touching his cap, spoke
to him.</p>

<p>'You won't remember me, sir?' he said. 'I've been working
Penrith way the last five years--Will Leathwaite.'</p>

<p>Adam stopped and smiled but looked bewildered.</p>

<p>'You will think me very uncivil,' he said.</p>

<p>'Why, sir,' said the man, smiling all over his rather simple
countenance. 'The Summer Fair of 'twenty-seven, when I won t'race
up to Druids' Circle. Why, sir, you rode with my poor old fayther
on his mare, Jessamy, and you was shouting for me fit to burst
your lungs. And I won, sir, I won! Bit too heavy now, I
reckon!'</p>

<p>Why, of course, Adam remembered! He saw the whole scene, how
their horse charged the village street, and how they must pause
on the road until the runners caught them up. He heard his eager
cry to the old farmer: 'Do you think Will will win, Mr
Leathwaite? Do you think Will will win?' And here was Will! And
Adam, looking at him, liked him.</p>

<p>They talked a little while. Will stood there, awkwardly,
kicking the snow with his boot. Then he looked up, his face
red.</p>

<p>'Not wanting any kind of servant, sir, are you?'</p>

<p>'Why, no,' said Adam. 'I'm a poor man, Leathwaite, a poor
man.'</p>

<p>'I'd come to you,' said Leathwaite, looking Adam straight in
the eyes, 'just for my keep.'</p>

<p>'What! Aren't you married?'</p>

<p>'No--nor likely to be.'</p>

<p>Adam nodded his head and smiled.</p>

<p>'Well, if I ever do want one--I'll tell you.'</p>

<p>They shook hands and Adam moved on. The wild goose, flying in
from the sea, circled over Skiddaw, then swerved towards the
water of the Lake, already thinly crusted with silver, dark in
the shadow under the hills.</p>

<p>As the afternoon lengthened excitement grew. All life was
<i>inside</i> the house now. The dining room was filled with the
long extended table; it was a place of mystery. Behind closed
doors the preparations for the ceremony went on. On every fire
all over the house the great logs blazed. Sylvia poked her head
through the door of Judith's room.</p>

<p>'That's right, my dear. Come in.'</p>

<p>Sylvia came in.</p>

<p>'I must go and make myself grand.' She stood and looked at the
old lady who sat toasting her toes at the fire. Sylvia considered
her. She loved Judith, had done so from the first moment of their
meeting. She would not have spent her Christmas in this
outlandish place had it not been for Judith. Yes, and her
curiosity. She had now, for so many years, intrigued, manipulated
in her London world that she was intensely curious and
inquisitive. She took it for granted that everyone intrigued,
that no one was what he or she seemed, that all private lives
trembled for ever on the edge of crises. And there was
something--should she speak of it to Judith or no? Judith also
loved her, but, considering her, now, found that she was not so
lovely as she had once been. She had aged lines on her forehead,
had something hard and even a little desperate about the corners
of her mouth. So many Herries, she reflected, aged before their
due time.</p>

<p>'Oh, Judith, I have never had a happier Christmas.'</p>

<p>'That's good. Sit down for five minutes. We have plenty of
time.'</p>

<p>'It must make you happy to have Adam and Margaret.'</p>

<p>'It does,' said Judith, kicking a shoe against the fender.</p>

<p>'I do wish that we saw them more often in London. But with
Adam's views . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know.'</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> of course do not care in the least, but some of our
friends think the Chartists would murder us all in our beds had
they the chance--'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear. Absurd.'</p>

<p>Sylvia sighed. 'It is so restful here. I dote on the country.
I hate my London life.'</p>

<p>'Then why do you lead it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know. What else should one do? Garth would be
bored to death in the country.'</p>

<p>'I suppose he would.'</p>

<p>'You know that Will's wife may be brought to bed at any
moment?'</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear.'</p>

<p>'Fancy--at his age! And how provoking for Walter!'</p>

<p>There was a pause and then Sylvia said:</p>

<p>'I suppose that Walter still keeps up this ridiculous
feud?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Judith. 'He is furious, I believe, that I have
John and Elizabeth here.'</p>

<p>Sylvia said:</p>

<p>'I saw him yesterday.'</p>

<p>Judith looked up sharply.</p>

<p>'Saw whom? Walter?'</p>

<p>Sylvia nodded.</p>

<p>'I was out walking. I had got on to the moor and was standing
looking around me when he rode up behind me. You cannot imagine
the start it gave me! You know--or maybe you do not know--in any
case a few years back he was attracted to me. It began years ago
when I stayed at Ireby for their opening Ball--the time when poor
Jennifer died. I have seen him since once or twice--not for a
considerable while though.'</p>

<p>Judith looked at her. How far had that gone? A strange shiver
of repugnance--the consciousness of herself being in any close
contact with Walter--for an instant held her. But Sylvia's
beautiful face was quite unmoved. She was absolutely calm.</p>

<p>'How altered he is! Quite shocking! So gross--I must confess
that I was uncomfortable. Dusk was falling and although the house
was not far distant--' She broke off. 'Well, I can look after
myself of course. However, he did not get down from his horse. We
exchanged only a few words.'</p>

<p>'What did he say?' Judith asked.</p>

<p>'He inquired how I did, said it was long since we had met.
Then he asked whether Elizabeth was staying at Uldale. I said she
was.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'He was very strange. Most odd. Judith, I think he may be
coming here tonight.'</p>

<p>'Coming here?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he said something about it, something about a surprise
visit. He said that it would make a fine bonfire if he burned
this house down and everyone in it.'</p>

<p>Judith smiled grimly.</p>

<p>'We will manage him if he does come.'</p>

<p>Sylvia bent and kissed Judith, then went, but at the door she
turned. 'The Herries men are so very peculiar,' she said. 'If
they cannot have what they want they rush to destruction. Garth
is just like that.'</p>

<p>In another room Elizabeth lay in John's arms. She
murmured:</p>

<p>'Darling, I must dress.'</p>

<p>He stroked her hair, kissed her eyes, held her passionately
close to him.</p>

<p>'Oh, Elizabeth,' he whispered, 'we must never be parted,
never, never, never, never.'</p>

<p>'Nothing can part us,' she said.</p>

<p>'Nothing? No one? Never?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. No one. Never.'</p>

<p>'I could not believe that love could grow when it was from the
beginning so intense. But when I look back to even a year ago it
does not seem that <i>that</i> was love at all.'</p>

<p>They held one another in an embrace that, they thought, defied
Death itself.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Before she went down to dinner Margaret looked into the
nursery. Dorothy, when Margaret had asked her permission, had
suddenly kissed her.</p>

<p>'I am fond of you, Margaret, I am indeed. We are more alike
than anyone else in this house is like either of us.'</p>

<p>Perhaps they were. Two large, plain domestic women. Margaret
had not thought that she was domestic. She had lived so long
working happily with her father for a Cause. Now she was
domestic. She wanted a child. It might be that all German women
were so.</p>

<p>So she went into the nursery. When John and Dorothy had been
children, there had been no nursery, but now, on the top floor,
they had knocked down a wall and bludgeoned a passage. The room
had sloping roofs, and wide windows stared out to Scotland. You
could see the Firth stir under the sun like a slippery silver
snake. When Margaret came in the four children were in bed, but
of course not asleep; Timothy was five, Veronica four, Amabel
three, Jane only two: Dorothy had been faithful to her duties,
and then Bellairs, having planted his seed, had incontinently
died.</p>

<p>Timothy was typical Bellairs, brave, stupid, kind and greedy.
But the girls were all Herries, Veronica and Amabel of one kind
and poor little Jane of the other. Veronica and Amabel were
proud, sensible, determined and self-satisfied. Nice little
girls, they already gave the impression that Herries little girls
were much the best. But Jane, dear Jane, was the true descendant
of the Rogue, of Francis, of all their cloudy ancestors before
them. She dreamt dreams, she cried for no reason, brokenly she
tried to explain that she saw things, a white horse, frozen
water, a lady with red hair; she was a nervous, sensitive child,
shy but most responsive to affection. It was to her cot that
Margaret went. The children lay, their eyes staring, their cheeks
hot, thinking of the marvellous day that it had been. In a heap
near the window were the new toys. There was a rocking-horse, a
doll's house, a 'shinny' stick and ball for Timothy.</p>

<p>They gave cries and shouts when they saw Margaret. They did
not know who she might be, but today everyone was a friend. She
talked to them, kissed them, but she knelt down beside Jane's
cot. Jane, whose head was covered with yellow curls like a
duckling's, smiled, stroked Margaret's cheek with a fat finger
and fell asleep, and Margaret knelt there, her heart aching as
though she were the loneliest woman in the world.</p>

<p>Down in the hall the boys from the village had arrived,
Mumming, and it was a great pity that they had chosen so bad a
time, for soon guests would be here and the ladies of the house
were dressing.</p>

<p>However, Madame miraculously appeared to have time for
everything, and there she was, sitting at the foot of the stairs,
almost under the mistletoe, dressed in her best and beating her
hands to the music. The boys, in the middle of their play, could
not but look at her, she was so very fine. Her white hair
gleamed, her naked shoulders shone (amazingly white for so old a
lady). Her dress had three skirts--cream, silver, cream
again--and was decorated with crimson roses. She wore silver
shoes.</p>

<p>'Bravo! Bravo!' she cried, tapping with her stick. The boys
were without coats and their white sleeves were tied with
ribbons, their hats decorated with evergreen, and they carried
thick staves.</p>

<p>There was a fiddle and a drum. Their dance was clever and most
intricate, advancing, retreating, advancing again and striking
their sticks the one against the other. They shouted Cumberland
shouts and brought with them into the candlelit hall the rough
tang of the mountain-stream running under grass, the windswept
'top' bare under the rushing cloud.</p>

<p>'Excellent! Most excellent!' Madame cried, thinking that they
must go to the kitchen for beef and ale, and the kitchen in
confused disorder because of the great Dinner.</p>

<p>One stout boy wore a fox's head and carried a fox's tail.
Another boy wore a mask with a huge nose and bulbous cheeks.</p>

<p>'I know!' cried Madame. That's Willy Caine . . . you can't
deceive me. How is your Aunt, Willie? She's up again, I
hear.'</p>

<p>She drove them, hot, flushed and happy, off into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Then the guests began to arrive. The Reverend Mr Summers and
his old, old wife, although they had the shortest way to come,
were of course the first. There were the Osmastons, the Applebys,
poor old Miss Keate from Keswick, a dry old maid, but she had
nowhere to go for her Christmas dinner, the two Miss Blossoms all
the way from Penrith (friends of Dorothy's), and Deborah's
grandchildren, Fred and Anne Withering, from near Carlisle.</p>

<p>They would sit down twenty altogether--quite as many as the
dining-room would hold--but Judith was bound to acknowledge that
she was proud of her table when, seated at the head of it with
stout Mr Osmaston on one side of her and old Mr Summers on the
other, she looked around her. She had her dear Adam near to her
and quite enough Herries to make her feel patriarchal. As you
looked down the two sides of the table you could pick without any
trouble the members of that family--Adam, Dorothy, John,
Elizabeth, Garth, the two Witherings. Unlike though they might
be, they were yet alike in these two things--in the high
prominent bones, the tall erect heads and straight shoulders--and
in their consciousness that they were dominating the rest of the
company and came first wherever they might be.</p>

<p>The room is looking beautiful, she thought. The old dark green
wallpaper was a fine setting to all the candlelight; the fruit,
piled high between the silver candlesticks, had a hard brilliant
edge of colour as though it were made of metal. Everyone smiled,
laughed. There was not a care in the world.</p>

<p>Old Bennett, dressed up in a green coat with silver buttons,
came in carrying a silver dish, and on it was a pig's head with a
lemon in its mouth. Everyone stood up: there was a great clapping
of hands; then, after an interval, attended by the stable-boy
(also dressed in a green coat with silver buttons), who carried
two lighted candles in silver candlesticks, old Bennett was back
again bearing the Wassail Bowl. This was a magnificent china
dish, crimson and gold, and the recipe of the drink had come all
the way from old Pomfret of Westaways and he had it from the old
Elizabethan Herries of the Mines. Roasted apples floated on its
surface, and the aromatic scent of it was as the spices of
Arabia.</p>

<p>Speeches were made, healths were drunk. Before the ladies left
the table Madame gave the speech of the evening; proud, happy,
her eye passing once and again to Adam, she was said by them all
to resemble Queen Elizabeth--Queen Elizabeth in an amiable mood,
be it understood.</p>

<p>When at last the gentlemen joined the ladies the Wassail Bowl
was empty and the house was flaming with jollity. To Fred
Withering it seemed there were three staircases, and old Mr
Summers confided to Osmaston an affair of his in his Oxford days
that was anything but clerical. Only John seemed apart from the
others ('Oh, the most beautiful man I have <i>ever</i> set eyes
on!' Miss Keate confided to Sylvia), his eyes resting constantly
on Elizabeth with an adoration that had something poignant in its
heart as though he were well aware that all was illusory,
vanishing at the touch, doomed to destruction.</p>

<p>'Cheer up, old boy,' cried Garth, who was completely drunk but
very charming.</p>

<p>John smiled and laughed; he was happier than he had ever been
in all his life.</p>

<p>While the dining-room was cleared for dancing they played
games--Cumberland games moreover. Instead of <i>Oranges and
Lemons</i> there was the Penrith <i>Down the Long
Lonnins:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Down the long lonnins we go, we go,<br>
 To gather some lilies, heigho, heigho!<br>
 We open the gates so wide, so wide,<br>
 To let King George and his men go by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>And then <i>Sandy O.</i></p>

<p>Here Judith, Dorothy, John and Adam, who had been all brought
up on it, sang the words with all their youth in their eyes:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My delight's in Sandy O,<br>
 My delight's in Brandy O,<br>
 My delight's in the red, red rose,<br>
 Come along, my Annie O.<br>
 Heigho for Annie O,<br>
 Bonny Annie O.<br>
 All the world would I give<br>
 For my bonny Annie O.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>For this game there is a girl in the middle, and she chooses
one from the ring; the tune is <i>Hops and Peas</i>.</p>

<p>And another 'ring' game, <i>Hops and Peas and
Barley-corn</i>:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hops and peas and barley-corn,<br>
 Hops and peas and barley-corn,<br>
 Hops and peas, hops and peas,<br>
 Hops and peas and barley-corn.<br>
 This is the way the farmer stands;<br>
 This is the way he folds his arms,<br>
 Stamps his feet, claps his hands,<br>
 Turns around to view his land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>How they all stamped and clapped!</p>

<p>'Yes, well,' said Miss Keate, who was wearing, quite out of
fashion, a turban, 'I never imagined for a moment--'</p>

<p>But best of all was <i>Green Gravel.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Round the green gravel the grass grows green,<br>
 All the fair maidens are shame to be seen;<br>
    Wash them in milk,<br>
    And dry them in silk;<br>
 Last down wedded--</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>At the word 'down' all slip to the ground, the last down is
married. Then she stands in the middle, and they sing a song
about her. Then she is asked which she likes best, butter or
sugar. If she says 'sugar' it is her sweetheart she likes; if
'butter' it is some other.</p>

<p>After a while Margaret slipped from the room. It was very hot.
She could not help it, but she felt isolated, alone. Everyone
knew everyone so well. Adam had been placed some distance from
her at the supper-table, and he was enjoying himself so greatly
that he had thought of nothing but his enjoyment. Men were like
that: children when they were happy. And she loved to see him so;
that was the desire of her heart, but once she caught John's eyes
as they rested on Elizabeth's young enchanting beauty and that
glance stabbed her. Elizabeth was so beautiful, so young and
virginal and good. Margaret seemed to herself old and soiled with
all her hard life with her father, the shabby places in which she
had lived, the poor desperate rebellious people who had been her
companions. She had been proud of the new dress that she had been
wearing, but now it seemed heavy and coarse. In the wild
extravagance of her mood it appeared to her that she had lost
Adam for ever . . .</p>

<p>She slipped upstairs and found her room. She threw herself on
to her bed and burst into tears. This was, perhaps, the first
time in her life that she had ever shed bitter tears; she had
been always calm, controlled, and had wondered, often enough,
that women should weep so readily and in front of those whom they
loved. She was in years only twenty-two, but she seemed to
herself to be so much older. She had felt often like a mother to
Adam, to her father even, and now that she should, like a little
child abandon herself to her grief! But she could not stop.
Faintly she heard, coming up to her from below, the singing and
laughter. Her curtains were not drawn, and she could see the snow
falling in a thick tide beyond her window. How cold and desolate
those hills, how bleak this North Country, how harsh the
loneliness that lay like an icy hand on her heart!</p>

<p>The door opened and, turning on her bed, she saw that Adam had
come in. He came in, happy and sweating. He was laughing, and his
black hair lay damp on his forehead. His eyes shone in his brown
face. His blue evening-coat with its dark velvet collar was
waisted almost to effeminacy, as was the fashion of those years,
and the tails of it stood out over his thick sturdy thighs. He
looked always better in rather rough loosely fitting clothes. He
came in laughing and humming the last notes of the <i>Green
Gravel</i>; then he saw Margaret. He stopped dead, and the change
in his face was almost ludicrous. Neither he nor anyone else had
ever seen her cry before. No, not her father when her mother
died.</p>

<p>'Margaret!'</p>

<p>It seemed to him in his astonishment that his heart turned
over in his chest.</p>

<p>'Margaret! What is it?'</p>

<p>She sat up, found her handkerchief, wiped her eyes and, rather
wanly, smiled.</p>

<p>'I suffered from a terrible headache. It was the heat.'</p>

<p>Clumsily, still bewildered, unable to realize what he saw, he
sat down on the bed. He took her hand, which was trembling but
suddenly lay quiet as it felt the tranquil reassurance and strong
bones of his brown one.</p>

<p>'A headache? But why did you not say?'</p>

<p>'Why should I disturb anyone? You were all so happy.'</p>

<p>He looked at her more closely.</p>

<p>'That's not true. You would not weep for a headache.'</p>

<p>As he saw her, whom he loved so dearly, with her hair in
disorder and her cheeks stained, his love that was so deeply
secure in his heart that he never questioned it, began to be
restless and uneasy.</p>

<p>They could neither of them lie to the other ever about
anything, so she said quietly:</p>

<p>'No, it was not the headache.'</p>

<p>'Well, what then?'</p>

<p>'I was foolish. Nothing but foolishness.'</p>

<p>He put his arm around her and drew her to him, but they were
not really together. He had been twenty-seven in September, so
that he was not very old, and he had no experience of women at
all. He began to be frightened as though something within him had
whispered: 'Take care, you may lose her.'</p>

<p>'But what is it, Margaret?' he repeated. 'Have I done
something.'</p>

<p>Then she said, dropping her voice, looking away from him:</p>

<p>'I thought you loved me no longer.'</p>

<p>His agitation increased. Loved her no longer, when he
worshipped her? Loved her no longer when only last night? . . .
But now his old trouble, that he could never find words to
express himself, attacked him.</p>

<p>'Love you?' he stammered. 'But, Margaret, I--I . . . I could
not love anyone more,' he ended, looking at her.</p>

<p>'No--I am sure. Of course. But perhaps it has been a great
mistake. I am not handsome. I am not clever. This is your world
and not mine . . .' Then she burst out with a sudden cry, a note
in her voice that he had never heard before. 'Oh, Adam, I have
been so lonely!'</p>

<p>The shock to him then was one of the worst of his life. He had
taken everything for granted. He had gone quietly on, troubled
about his work and his feeble achievement in it, troubled at the
state of the world and the general unhappiness, but sure always
of two things--his love for Margaret and his mother, and their
love for him. These were so sure that he never dreamed that they
needed expression. Like so many other Englishmen he lived in a
man's world where expression of feeling was something too foreign
to be decent.</p>

<p>The thought of his mother stirred, a recognized solid fact, in
the middle of all his bewilderment.</p>

<p>'But my mother? Has she been unkind to you?'</p>

<p>'No. She has been very kind. It is not her fault that she
cannot like me.'</p>

<p>'But she does like you. She said so last night.'</p>

<p>Ah, then they had been discussing her! The two of them
together wrapped in their own intimacy! But Margaret had a noble
nature, above and beyond all smallness or mean jealousy. She put
her arm around Adam's neck.</p>

<p>'My love . . . Forget this. I have had so little experience of
the world, and all women are foolish sometimes. I have felt
sometimes that we could speak to one another more, say more what
was in our hearts--and tonight you were all together, you knew
one another so well. I was foolish . . . Forgive me, forgive
me.'</p>

<p>Then, with her head against his breast, she cried again, not
wishing to stop her tears that, in their flow, seemed to release
and set free all her misery of the last weeks, release it so that
it would never return again. He held her in his arms as though at
any moment she might escape him. The shock and the surprise were
to him tremendous and the effect of this would remain with him
for the rest of his life. His heart was so tender, he hated so
passionately to wound or hurt anything alive (unless it were an
enemy, someone or something that he thought cruel and evil) that
the knowledge of hurting her was terrible to him.</p>

<p>'Margaret! Margaret! Don't cry. You shall never cry again.
What I have done, wrapped in myself, never seeing . . . But I
never can say what I feel. I don't deserve that you should love
me. I shall make it up to you now all my life long.'</p>

<p>He stroked her hair. They stayed, cheek against cheek, in
silence. At last he said:</p>

<p>'We shall understand one another now.'</p>

<p>She kissed him and, holding his head passionately against her
breast, looking out to the falling snow beyond the window,
murmured: 'Now no one can separate us. I shall never be afraid
again.'</p>

<p>A little later, intensely happy, hand in hand they went
downstairs and rejoined the company.</p>

<p>Now had it not been for an excellent journal known as <i>The
Cumberland Paquet</i> the astonishing events that made this
evening for ever memorable (so that years later they were, in a
much exaggerated form, often recalled) would never have been
known to the outside world. But it happened that there intervened
now a short pause in the festivities--a pause between games and
the dancing, and Miss Keate, hot in the head with exercise (and
some of the Wassail Bowl), and young Mrs Appleby found a place on
the corner of the stairs where they might cool. From their
position, it must be noted, they had a perfect view of the hall
and the hall door. Miss Keate had with her a copy of <i>The
Cumberland Paquet</i> of December 13th which she had discovered
in a corner of the parlour. She had secretly abstracted it that
she might have 'a quiet read with it at home'. She was just such
a lady, a kind of magpie, and, being of very slender fortune,
picked up once and again 'things that she was sure no one else
could want'. But now being with Mrs Appleby cooling on a corner
of the stairs it was natural that they should look over it
together. Had they not done so they would certainly have joined
the company in the dining-room and shared in the dancing.</p>

<p><i>The Cumberland Paquet</i> was, however, of surpassing
interest. There was a leader about the Emperor of China and the
vast sum of money that he had paid to the British (most
gratifying to British pride), something about India, and
something about the very mild season so that a 'blackbird had
been heard in the neighbourhood of Springfield making the
neighbouring woods echo with his melodious strains'.</p>

<p>'Poor blackbird,' sighed Miss Keate, whose heart was most
tender, 'he must be quite dead by now.'</p>

<p>There was a fascinating advertisement which both ladies, their
heads close together, read with absorbed interest, that 'Mrs
Taylor begs most respectively to inform the ladies of Ulverston
and its vicinity that she has just received an assortment of
SIMISTER'S PATENT WOVE STAYS, which are now ready for
inspection.</p>

<p>'To those Ladies who have made trial of the Patent Wove Stay
comment is unnecessary, but to those Ladies who have not--'</p>

<p>'Have you, my dear?' asked Miss Keate.</p>

<p>'Well, no,' answered Mrs Appleby. 'You see . . .' and then
followed five minutes of delightful intimacy.</p>

<p>The real news, however, that kept them glued to the stairs and
so made them witness of what followed was a thrilling account of
the doings at the Whitehaven Theatre. It was headed: Theatrical
Fracas, and it began: 'We stated in the last number of the
<i>Paquet</i> that Mrs Paumier, the wife of the Manager of our
Theatre, would take her benefit on Friday evening, and expressed
the hope that the play-going public of this town would, as they
had done on a former occasion, give her a bumper.' Unfortunately
the bumper was prevented because, just before the rise of the
curtain, the rest of the company struck for higher wages, the
audience grew restive at the delay, and 'some sharp words passed
between Mrs Paumier and the performers'. Something very like a
riot followed. There was in another part of the <i>Paquet</i> a
public statement: 'indeed Mr and Mrs Paumier seemed in universal
trouble'.</p>

<p>'Why, just listen!' murmured Miss Keate, and she read to her
companion:</p>

<p>'It being currently reported that Mr Gilfillan has signified
to all persons visiting his wife for beneficial purposes, that he
has received from Mr Paumier little or nothing on account of his
(Mr Gilfillan's) services at the Theatre, Mr Paumier deems it his
duty to publish the following receipt bearing Mr Gilfillan's
signature, in order that his (Mr Paumier's) character may in some
measure be redeemed until a full and printed statement of his
outlay shall be given.'</p>

<p>'Well, did you ever?' said Miss Keate. 'Actors and actresses!
What a life they lead! Quite another world from ours! Living on
the edge of a volcano. I dare say if the truth were known--'</p>

<p>Miss Keate always afterwards said that it was at this moment
(she would remember the name of the Paumiers, she said, so long
as she lived) that she had the strangest premonition that
something dreadful was about to happen. There was certainly no
reason for any premonition, for a more perfect Christmas scene
could not be imagined. Everyone now was dancing and the screech
of the violin could be heard through the closed doors. Both hall
and parlour were deserted; the ladies had only the mistletoe and
holly for cheerful company.</p>

<p>But Miss Keate would for ever swear that she had her
premonition. She put up her head, caught Mrs Appleby's hand,
dropping the <i>Paquet,</i> and listened. Immediately after there
came a terrific banging at the house-door. You would have thought
that everyone within a mile would have heard it, but the door of
the dining-room was closed and inside the room the music, the
laughter, the tramp of feet as the country dances went their way
made it a world enclosed.</p>

<p>Miss Keate and Mrs Appleby sprang to their feet; after a short
interval the knocking was repeated and now more violently than
before. Soon a maid came to the door, hesitated and then, as the
knocking was renewed a third time, opened it. It was then that
the two ladies knew the sensation of their lives, for with the
open door the wind, carrying with it a flurry of snow, blew into
the hall, set the mistletoe rocking; with the wind came a man.
The ladies did not, in the first moment, see who it was, for his
riding-coat blew about his face, but a second after he looked up
and about, stared at the ladies, and they instantly recognized
him. It was Mr Walter Herries.</p>

<p>The door banged behind him, and he stood there, his bulk
filling the hall, his face red and angry. The little maid did not
know what to do, nor for the matter of that did the two ladies
either. Then he cried out in a voice like a bull's:</p>

<p>'I've come for my daughter!'</p>

<p>Miss Keate was very good, in after years, as she pictured the
scene. She had a sense of the dramatic. She described the holly
and mistletoe, the sound of music and dancing, the frightened
eyes of the maid, and then, about Mr Herries, she would say:</p>

<p>'Oh, you never saw a more enraged man! His face was crimson.
You could conceive him bursting. You would have supposed that he
would pull the house down. Clara Appleby trembled all over; I had
to place my arm around her to steady her or she would have
fainted, I am sure.'</p>

<p>There is something absurd, of course, in a man roaring out
that he wanted his daughter, and Miss Keate, who had quite a
satiric turn when she liked, saw that clearly:</p>

<p>'He was standing right under the mistletoe. Too absurd when
you come to think of it!'</p>

<p>He said no more, but stood there waiting. The maidservant went
to the dining-room and returned, an instant later, with Judith.
<i>That</i> was a moment for the two ladies--a very great moment
indeed.</p>

<p>'Madame,' Miss Keate would afterwards relate, 'must have known
whom to expect. She came out to him like the Queen of England and
she said, in a voice as clear as a bell and as though it were the
most ordinary thing in the world, "Well, Walter? Good evening.
And what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>'"Do for me! You can fetch me my daughter and be damned to the
lot of you!"</p>

<p>'"Yes--we had better discuss it in here, I think."'</p>

<p>To the exquisite disappointment of the two ladies Judith and
Walter vanished into the parlour. Miss Keate always afterwards
said that from the very beginning Judith Paris appeared to have
some power over the man. The two ladies stood there staring, and
listening with all their ears. For some while there was little to
hear or see. A maid knocked on the parlour door. Then the
dining-room door opened, throwing into the hall a burst of music
and gaiety, and out came John and Elizabeth. They had been given
some message. They hesitated in the hall, then, hand in hand,
went into the parlour, closing the door behind them. For a while
again there was silence, and then--</p>

<p>But Miss Keate was never to know what exactly occurred
<i>inside</i> the parlour.</p>

<p>And what occurred was this:</p>

<p>'Sit down, Walter,' said Judith, when they were both inside.
He stood just by the door, glowering at her, his head thrust a
little forward. Judith saw that he had been drinking, that he had
a smear of mud on his chin, and that he held, in one gloved hand,
a riding-whip. The room was in complete confusion, the carpet
turned up, a chair on its side, holly dripping over the
mantelpiece, a lady's ribbon on the ground, a lace
handkerchief.</p>

<p>'Sit down, Walter, pray,' said Judith. 'And tell me why--'</p>

<p>'You know why,' he answered, his eyes shifting up and down the
room. She sat on the sofa and twirled a large white feather fan
in her fingers. Her ivory cane (which she was not at all sure she
might not have to make use of before the end of the interview)
rested near her.</p>

<p>'Indeed I do not, Cousin Walter.'</p>

<p>He came nearer to her.</p>

<p>'I warned you. I told you that you could go too far. Too far!
By God, you've always gone too far!'</p>

<p>He was, she supposed, about fifty years of age and he looked
sixty with the heavy black pouches under his eyes, the purple
veins in cheeks and nose. Oddly, the strain of liking that, in
spite of all that he had done, she had always had for him, still,
she discovered, survived. Poor Walter! What a mess he had made of
everything!</p>

<p>'I have come for my daughter.'</p>

<p>'Elizabeth? Certainly you shall see her.'</p>

<p>'She returns with me to Ireby tonight.'</p>

<p>Judith looked at him impatiently.</p>

<p>'But, Walter, that is absurd. She is no longer a child. She is
a married woman.'</p>

<p>'We can soon stop <i>that</i> marriage. It shall be dissolved.
She was married by force.'</p>

<p>'Indeed she was not!' answered Judith indignantly. 'If ever
anyone married freely she did. The marriage has been the greatest
success.'</p>

<p>She was listening with all her ears. At any moment dancing
revellers might break from the dining-room into the hall and the
parlour. She had seen Miss Keate and Mrs Appleby on the stairs.
She was determined to finish this scene as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>'It has, has it?' said Walter, coming yet closer to her.</p>

<p>She saw that he was in a confused drunken rage, uncertain as
to what he would do or say but determined to assert his
power.</p>

<p>'And I know who contrived that marriage. It was you, my fine
lady. It has been a long battle between us. You think I forget,
but I forget nothing. Do you remember how I whipped your naked
little bastard up at Hawkshead years ago? Well, I'd whip him
again--'</p>

<p>'It is Elizabeth that we are speaking about,' Judith answered
quietly.</p>

<p>He paused to pull himself together. Word slipped from word,
sentence from sentence. There was a fog in his brain.</p>

<p>'I demand to see my daughter,' he muttered.</p>

<p>'Certainly you shall,' she answered briskly, pulling the bell
at her side.</p>

<p>He was swaying a little on his feet.</p>

<p>'Why don't you sit down, Cousin Walter?' she asked him again.
'You don't look at all well.'</p>

<p>'I am in perfect health,' he answered furiously. 'Never
better.'</p>

<p>'And Uhland?' she asked politely.</p>

<p>But this politeness bewildered him. He shook his whip at
her.</p>

<p>'Look here, Judith!' he said. 'You're damned clever. You
always were. But you don't get round me this way. Do you hear?
You can't abduct my daughter from under my nose and I have
nothing to say. No, I'm damned if you can. And then marry her to
that young swine . . . I always swore that I'd finish him, and by
God I will. The whole lot of you. Rude to my mother, was she? I
told her she'd repent it.'</p>

<p>He was referring now apparently to Jennifer, and a picture
rose before Judith of that poor bewildered lady walking in her
black dress across the fields.</p>

<p>The maid appeared.</p>

<p>'Please tell Mr John and Mrs Herries to come to me here
immediately.'</p>

<p>She turned to Walter.</p>

<p>'Now, Walter, pray let us have no scenes. These are old, old
quarrels that should have been long ago buried. Elizabeth is a
sweet girl. She and John are devoted. What else is there left to
build enmity upon? I am sure that you are not angry with me. You
never were. And, although you have behaved badly once and again,
I forgive you everything. Now let us be friends--'</p>

<p>John and Elizabeth entered the room. Inside the door they
released hands and Elizabeth came forward, her head up. She held
out her hand.</p>

<p>'She was the loveliest creature,' Judith afterwards said, 'I
ever saw. There were roses all over her silk skirt, roses in her
cheeks. Her curls were untidy with her dancing and she had the
face of an angel. Any father would have been moved by it.'</p>

<p>Walter, however, was not moved. He disregarded her hand and,
swaying on his heavy feet, said: 'You are to come back with
me.'</p>

<p>She looked round at John for a moment, then smiling said:</p>

<p>'But I am married, Father.'</p>

<p>She, who had been afraid of him all her life, had no fear at
all.</p>

<p>Then he began to storm.</p>

<p>'You shall obey your father, do you hear? It was no marriage.
You're not married to him. You disobedient . . . disobedient . .
.' He began to choke and he put his hand to his throat. He
continued to look past Elizabeth to John; all his great body was
increasingly agitated. Judith rose from the sofa and went up to
him, putting her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>'Walter, this is absurd. You must see that it is. John and
Elizabeth are married and have been for a long while. And why
not? They love one another, and John has a fine position in
London. You don't know him. You've scarcely ever seen him. All
your silly hatred is built up upon nothing. Now make the best of
it. Shake hands with them . . .'</p>

<p>But he had not been listening to her at all and, suddenly, he
rushed forward catching John by the shoulder with one hand,
raising the whip with the other.</p>

<p>'You damned puppy! I'll teach you a lesson. I'll teach you a
lesson. I'll kill you for stealing my daughter. Steal my
daughter, will you? I'll teach you.'</p>

<p>He raised his arm and, clawing John's collar, slashed at him
with the whip. No one but Elizabeth saw that in that moment John
turned white as the mistletoe berries above them, or that, at
Walter's touch, his body seemed to collapse as though his bones
had melted. She saw that and, knowing John's courage, realized
even at that moment of touch that there was some additional
horror here, something old and inborn, quite beyond physical
terms.</p>

<p>But it was Judith who had the centre of the stage. Walter's
touch on John seemed to swing her into one of those old rages of
hers that had for long now been disciplined, for she rushed and
threw herself on Walter with so much vehemence that the surprise
of it tumbled him forward. She caught his arm and, small though
she was, swung him right round and then slapped his face as
though she were tearing paper. The whip fell; Walter put up his
hand to his cheek and stood there staring.</p>

<p>'You dare! You dirty bully! You come into <i>my</i> house
again! You blackguard! I'll show you where you are in <i>my</i>
house. Go! . . . There's the door! You show your face again! You
dare! You . . .'</p>

<p>She stamped her foot; she raged like a fishwife, glaring into
him as though she would tear his nose out of his face.</p>

<p>He turned, bent half down as though he would pick up the whip,
but let it lie there.</p>

<p>'Pick it up! Pick it up!' she stormed. 'I won't have any of
your filthy things in <i>my</i> house! Christmas Day too! Where
are your feelings? Where's your decency? Never you dare to set
your foot . . .'</p>

<p>He picked up the whip, stared at her still in a dazzled,
confused fashion, muttered something, fumbled for the door.</p>

<p>As he opened it they were all suddenly aware of social
conventions; they heard, with an immediate pressing clarity, the
murmur of the music and the dancing feet. They all three followed
him into the hall.</p>

<p>Judith herself opened the big door for him and stood there,
with John just behind her, while the snow whirled in the wind
that blew the light over the porch.</p>

<p>'Goodnight, Walter . . . Goodnight,' Judith said.</p>

<p>Miss Keate saw him go out, his head down. 'As though she'd
whipped him,' she always ended her story.</p>

<p>Elizabeth went to John, putting her arm through his; the
dining-room door opened and someone ran out.</p>

<p>'John! Elizabeth! You must come for "Sir Roger".'</p>

<p>'Don't mind, John. Don't mind,' Elizabeth whispered. She was
beginning a new relation with him from that moment.</p>

<p>But he whispered back: 'There was Uhland there--standing in
the porch under the light.'</p>

<p>She didn't hear. She pressed his arm with her hand. 'It's
nothing,' she said again. 'I have finished with my father for
ever.'</p>

<p>But John stared at the door. It was not Walter Herries but
Uhland that he was seeing.</p>

</center>

<p> </p>

<p>IREBY, <i>January 5th, 1843</i></p>

<p>Finished tonight that stuff-and-nonsense book Carlyle's
<i>Heroes</i>. Wonder that I had the patience to read it on to
the end, but I fancy that I was always going further to see
whether all his tall words and German sentences would lead to
anything. They do not any more than does this damnably silly
Journal of mine. There is just this difference. Carlyle is a
hypocrite and I am not. He knows he is no hero but says he is
one--I know that I can be a hero as suitably as any of his
Fredericks and Cromwells, but prefer not to be one. And why do I
prefer? Because the world is so crammed with fools and conceited
coxcombs that it is a finer thing to sit by and watch--to watch,
if you like, the decline and fall of the house of Herries and
myself with it. Bang--Bang--Bang--Whiskers--Whiskers--Whiskers.
This is nothing but the sound a blind man makes seeing himself to
bed with the light of a thick stick and the smell of the
candle-end. And it is also, if you like, the noise that my
beloved father and Sam Osmaston are making just under this floor
of my room, both as drunk as cockchafers in lamplight, on their
knees most likely, searching for a goose's feather.</p>

<p>But this Journal is supposed to say what I do. Well, what do I
do? Get up, you lamentable cripple, and look at yourself in the
glass, examine once again your ugly wry face, your ribs, like an
old mans' counting-board, and your white bit of twisted bone
politely called a leg. Good, good! That's the thing, my boy!
That's the way to bring your conceit down and sit on the floor to
talk about Heroes. But the soul's the thing, is it not? Does not
old Carlyle say so? The soul! The soul! Where may you be, soul?
Stuck in that leg of mine? Hiding like a rabbit behind a rib or
two? Well, come out for once! Let's have a look at you! Where are
you, green, crimson or mulberry; and your shape? Are you
tortoise-like with a shell like a snuff-box, or thin and spidery,
catching flies for your food, or just a pincushion with pink lace
and a blue silk bow?</p>

<p>What a week I've had too!</p>

<p>They've all been here. The Newmarks with all their brood,
Phyllis a female Alderman, Newmark the prize prig of the market,
Horace as long in the leg as a pair of stilts and as wooden,
<i>dear</i> little Emily and <i>dear</i> little Barnabas. All
with the latest news of my good grandfather's new offspring. 'Oh,
<i>what</i> a sweet infant! the dearest little boy!' until I
thought my father would throttle the lot of them. Amery Herries
too with eyes like gooseberries, the merriest drunken bachelor,
and old Rodney from Polchester, sixty if he's a day, touring the
Lakes and Scotland with one eye on his clerical dignity and the
other on the destiny of every halfpenny! Lord, how I hate the lot
of them and how they hate me! Didn't I make little Emily cry by
blowing out the candle, and isn't old Rodney afraid of my
humours? A family sinking to rot, my masters, cursed because,
between too much money-bag on the one side and too much
indecisive dreaming on the other, the way to Salvation is missed
every time. Not that there <i>is</i> any Salvation, even though
you search for it. Nothing but madness or death from over-eating
whichever way you go.</p>

<p>But now when the house is silent and every stone in this
building can be heard scraping its reproaches, I wonder at my
indignation. Indignant? No, I have not blood enough for so bold a
word. I sit here, sneezing, rubbing my knees the one against the
other, healing Rob's ear in the basket, raising my perpetual
theme of hatred of my dear John brother-in-law and do nothing,
positively nothing. Neither lust urges me nor greed nor envy nor
desire for knowledge: only if I had John's neck here I would
twist it until his eyes were in his back, and even that is a
fancy--nurtured lust, something bred of years of coddling. It
<i>had</i> a reason once and now I've fed my brain with so many
centuries of imagination that to see him tortured in my fancy is
as good as the actual deed.</p>

<p>And yet it could have been otherwise. Only this stupid
mutton-faced Journal shall know how otherwise it might have been!
Another father, flat-faced Adam for a brother and a pair of legs
like anyone's, and I had the power, the wish, the ambition. I
could have written a book or two, I fancy, better than Bulwer at
any rate, or played in a laboratory and made a discovery, or
talked as wittily as any Disraeli or Palmerston of them all. I
have more brains in my toenail (those on the withered foot have
an especial brilliancy) than all my Herries cousins lumped
together. But from the very first I was outcast. <i>That</i> at
least is no imagination. I make no claim for it and I ask for no
pity, but to be different from birth, to have the street children
mock at you and the dogs bark, and visitors to the house look the
other way--it is a kind of allowance for hatred. They say Carlyle
has dyspepsia and yet he thinks himself a Hero. Well, am I not a
Hero that I sit here and think, and think, and wish myself a
villain? And my father still loves me. He thinks me a miracle of
brilliance and perversity. All that is left to him, poor man, for
his brain is fuddled with drink, the ladies won't call, his fine
house is a stony desert, and they flourish at Uldale like the
righteous!</p>

<p>Ah! there's the rub! Cousin Judith as lively as a flea, Cousin
Dorothy and her children fat as good cattle, John and Elizabeth
like sucking-doves. There! He is singing. I can hear him under
the floor. And Sam Osmaston with him--a fine out-of-tune chorus .
. .</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ireby, <i>November 13th, 1843</i></p>

<p>Rob's ear has this canker again. It's his perversity, I well
believe, for he knows truly that once his ear is well, out he'll
go, to be stoned by the Keswick boys again, I suppose. And the
odd thing is, I shan't care. He's been with me almost a year now.
I enjoy his face like the parson's, with its side-whiskers and a
slobbery white patch like spilt milk on his nose. He's fonder of
me than any dog's ever been, but I hate that sycophancy. I'm near
shooting him at times or hanging him from the beam with a
rope--yes, even while I wash and clean his ear with the
tenderness of a woman.</p>

<p>And now what do you think, O my Journal? What has our dear
father done but buy a piece of the moor just above Uldale and
build a small cottage on it and into that shove Peach and his
dirty brood. There is just one patch, it seems, that
great-grandfather David neglected to buy, a measly brown bit that
even the sheep neglect. He has done it to vex Aunt Judith of
course, and vex her it must to have the filthy little Peaches at
her garden gate, and Peach at war with her drunken Rackstraw.</p>

<p>Since she scratched dear father's cheeks last Christmas-time
he's been all bent on vexing her, although in my view he thinks
her a damnably fine old woman. So she is! She and Adam--another
brood from the rest of them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>November 22nd</i></p>

<p>I am just back from Rosthwaite where I have been limping about
all day like an old woman looking for eggs. But something or
someone (Algebraical formula? <i>x + y</i> =
<i>xy<sup>2</sup></i> = God?) had put it into my mind of late to
be interested in my old Great-great-grandfather, the Rogue. It
seems that he spent half his life longing for a gipsy girl (Aunt
Judith's mother by oddity) who, when he got her at last,
incontinently died. I like the smell of that old man and have
picked up a pack of curiosities about him, how he sold a stout
mistress at Keswick Fair, was given a scar in a duel, fought for
the Pretender outside Carlisle or some such thing, married his
gipsy at Rosthwaite and cuffed and kicked the guests down his
stairs, how she ran away and he roamed the hills for years
looking for her; then, catching her at last, gave her Judith whom
she died of. There is something deeply sympathetic to me here,
for he was outcast as I am, a rebel as I, if I had the guts,
would be, a hater too, I fancy, only he would not play Hamlet by
the year as I have done.</p>

<p>His old house is a ruin, some tumbled barns swallowed in weed
and swiftly vanishing. I sat on some broken mouldy stairs this
afternoon and could have sworn to seeing the old fellow watching
me ironically. It's his irony I like the taste of. None of the
Herries have irony save Aunt Judith. I would like a picture of
him, but father says there is none; however, an old cottager well
over ninety years with whom I talked today--a lively cursing old
man with no teeth, so that he must hiss like a snake when he
talks, but his hearing is mighty sharp--he remembers him, how he
came striding over the little bridge by Rosthwaite, in a
plum-coloured coat with a scar down his cheek, and how he and his
gipsy lay both dead in the house together and an old man rode up
on a horse and carried the new-born child (Judith, by all that's
comic) away on his horse with him. The only man of our family
with whom I have any touch, and he dead these seventy years!
Grandfather Will must remember him. Next time in London I shall
harry his wits over him . . .</p>

<p>I am planning a long London visit. This house is the devil. It
is colder than any crypt, and the stone, cover it as you may,
breaks through and snarls at you. Every wind in the country whips
it and the trees moan like kitchen-maids with the toothache. Also
I have the ambition to touch up Cousin John a trifle. I could
look in at his window and give him a queasy stomach. What is this
hatred? Contempt of his mealy-mouthed propriety? Rage at his
impertinent marriage with my sister? Jealousy of his strength and
whole limbs? Something taught to me in my cradle by my father?
Yes, and more than all this. I hate him because I have always
done so, because of what he is and because he is happy and I am
not. These are honest reasons, but behind these there is the
pleasure of the pursuit. As my old roguish ancestor pursued his
gipsy so I pursue my John. We freaks in the Herries stock must
have our revenge on the normal ones; there is a warfare there
that has necessity in it. And I have no other emotions. I have
never lusted after a woman in all my days, nor cared for a human
being save Adam. Is that my own fault? I could have asked for
quite another destiny, but I had no say in it. So, to my only
pleasure, to see him start at the sound of my step and flinch
under my hand. My leg aches in sympathy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>12 Granger Street, London</p>

<p><i>February 12th, 1844</i></p>

<p>Three weeks in London. What a folly! Dinner at Richmond or
Blackwall, the Cave of Harmony, the Coal Hole and such; the inner
sanctities of Meadows' and 'Seven's the main' of the caster, and
'Gentlemen, make your game' of the groom-porter. Cards everywhere
and, even without the perils of lansquenet, with a pony on the
rubber, five pound points and betting on the odd trick, you are
caught before you are hooked. There is scarcely a quiet
respectable house in all London where they won't rook you if you
give them half a chance.</p>

<p>All the same there's a strange curtain of hypocritical
respectability over this town since my last visit. They say it is
our good little Queen and our handsome German Prince. No nonsense
at Court, they say. All heading now for the Virtues.</p>

<p>Last night a party at my grandfather's where, if you please,
we sat round in a circle and a woman with teeth like a grinning
hag's read us the poems of Mr Tennyson. Poor old grandfather
would have slumbered happily in his corner had not Mrs Will in a
pink dress with 'volants' almost up to her waist (and there must
have been at least eight rows of them) pinched him after every
melancholy verse. She had time too for elegant flirtation with a
fat young man whose whiskers were as long as a horse's mane! I
have never disliked anyone more and her loathing of myself is
badly concealed by her extreme endearments. She was frightened of
me, I believe and hope. But I perceive that I throw a gloom on to
every party that I encounter. All the better. This London is a
meeting-place of all the snobs, hypocrites, sharps and idiots of
Christendom.</p>

<p>But I remain, for I have my own quiet amusements. One of these
is the clearing of Cousin Garth's pockets, for such a juggins at
cards deserves clearing.</p>

<p>Another is to listen to the bombast of old James or Carey who
both have the fancy that <i>their</i> England <i>(theirs</i>,
mark you) is the most Christian and at the same time the most
commercial miracle that this weary planet has ever beheld! To
hear them talk of old Pam or of Peel you would fancy that we had
no Chartists nor starving populace whatever, and to listen to
their contempt of <i>any</i> foreign country is to realize to the
full <i>one</i> side of the beautiful Herries shield!</p>

<p>I listen and then with one remark blow their soap-bubbles to
air--and don't they hate me for it too! It is worth the boredom
of London to see old James flush his double-chin and stutter:
'But, my dear sir--my <i>dear</i> young friend . . .'</p>

<p>I have a deeper pleasure than these mild amusements, though. I
have discovered Cousin John's hours: he leaves Bryanston Square
five of an evening and for the good of his precious health walks
across the Park. Thrice a week at least I see to it that he shall
encounter me. We never speak; indeed one glimpse of me is enough
to destroy his peace for the rest of the day. He would take a cab
were it not that he fights his cowardice, and it has happened
twice that when he has taken one I have followed him in another,
coming from mine as he issues from his. This game gives me a wild
and sensual pleasure. There are certain streets and houses that
are marked with the colour of our meetings. Best of all I learnt
from Sylvia Herries last week that he and Elizabeth would be at
the theatre. They had a box and I in the pit enjoyed my evening
to the full. At every meeting it seems to me that we come closer
together even as my father grows closer to Uldale. I am contented
to bide my time, for there is no pleasure for me in life like
this chase. Is this madness? It may be that it is, for it seems
to me that I am now two persons and when the one is not with him
the other is. I sleep but little and walk the streets at night,
hearing my own step in pursuit of myself, that same halting
stumble that must, I know, haunt the bowels of Cousin John. I
would swear that last night, dressing for grandfather's party, I
saw two figures in the mirror and neither shadowy . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>March 13th</i></p>

<p>I have had an encounter that has moved me oddly. Yesterday
afternoon in the Strand I walked straight into Adam. He was brown
and ruddy and sturdy, dressed roughly, books under his arm, his
eyes serious and kindly as they ever were. May the Devil forgive
me, but I was pleased to see him. Our talk was thus:</p>

<p>'Why, Adam!'</p>

<p>'Why, Uhland!'</p>

<p>'Are you well?'</p>

<p>'And you?'</p>

<p>His hand was on my arm and I felt, for a foolish minute, that
I would have followed him anywhere. He is the only one in the
world not to glance at my leg, to be perfectly at ease with me,
to give me some glimpse of a normal world where men are honest
and mean their words. Yet I doubt not he is a prig and thinks
highly of his own virtues. Yet he was kind without hypocrisy. He
asked me to visit them and he meant it, I think. But I turned
away. I could have struck him for moving me as he did. I could
have struck him, but I looked back after him as though I were
letting my best chance go. He is still on my mind today. He has
given me his address and I have half an impulse to visit him. But
for what? I should but despise his amiability and suspect his
seriousness. There is no place where we can move side by side and
I do not know that I wish that there should be.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ireby, <i>April 7th, 1845</i></p>

<p>I am so much better that I can at last get to my Journal
again. Not that I hunger for it, but it is at least a testimony
to some energy. And today has been a day as warm as milk and so
still that you can hear the cows munching. There was all morning
a mist like thick honey with the light breathing behind it a
glorious exultant spirit. The sun has been dim all day and
Blencathra and Skiddaw have been like whales, unicorns, blankets
of soft down, and this afternoon when the sun came fully out and
the air was blue they rolled over in delight as puppies do when,
deliciously expectant, they want their stomachs stroked. It is
not like me to write of the weather, but I have been ill for so
long and have smelt nothing but candle-ends, slops and the horsey
grain of my blankets.</p>

<p>Last evening I had an odd talk with my father that needs
recording. He came in wobbling a candle, in a bed-gown, his chest
exposed, but in spite of this very sober. I have been dimly
conscious of him the last months, coming in and out of my
fantasies. And <i>what</i> fantasies! Myself hanging, bare save
for a thin shift, from a beam, my toes turned in, and my second
self exuding like milk from an udder out of my left ear--and I
was Grandfather Will's infant, guzzling at a bottle and clutching
a money-bag, and the room was on fire and myself in the middle of
it frying like an acorn, or I hobbled on Stye Head, the mists
chasing me until I fell headlong into Eskdale, and once a white
horse, flashing up a frozen mountainside, caught me with its
teeth and flung me down into ice. In and out of this, then, has
come my good father, but only last evening did we have any
serious conversation.</p>

<p>He tells me that he has not had a drop of liquor for the last
six months, during my illness. And I can believe him. For once he
does not look more than his fifty odd years. His fat is dropped
from him--yes, and his spirits have gone too. He is a little
crazed, I think, as I am. This house has the seeds of craziness
in its bones. For he says that Aunt Judith has poisoned me, some
insane story about her bribing the cook to spoil my food! There's
real craziness as I told him, for whatever that old lady may be
about it will never be poisoning. He tells me, however, that
Rackstraw whipped one of the Peach children within an inch of its
existence for stealing out of the Uldale kitchen window and that
one of the Uldale barns has been set on fire. He wants to have
Aunt Judith in jail, but I tell him that the countryside would
burn the jail down to get her out.</p>

<p>When all this loose talk of revenge and the rest had died away
he besought me not to leave him. He has a fear, it seems, that I
shall steal away just as Elizabeth did. He moved me for he loves
me with the strongest mingling of pride, fear and egotism. God
knows I don't want his love. I have no regard for him except that
it seems to me we are caught in the same trap. My illness has
left my head clear and empty. I am imprisoned and cannot be free
until some act frees me. Death, perhaps, of which I have no fear.
But death liberates only one of myself. The other remains
imprisoned.</p>

<p>My father held my body in his arms. How lonely and isolated an
act! No one has ever held me close to their breast since I was an
infant, and my father is not a man of sentiment, but he sees
everything else going--health, reputation, wealth--save his love
for me and his hatred of the Uldale lot. I tell you we Herries
are lost men if we let our dreams go too far, be they good or
bad, and this old folly of hating one another is a dream like the
rest, for there is no satisfaction to be found in any egoistic
desire. I can see that we are intended to lose ourselves
altogether in something impersonal, and once Cousin John, the
pretty, were gone I could be lost, I fancy, turning with what
relief into the thick honeyed air like a child loosed from school
. . . But what a couple the two of us, my gross father straining
my bony wasted fretfulness against his bare chest, and our eyes
refusing to meet! And myself, round the corner, peering and
grinning at the idiocy of the scene from behind the wardrobe.</p>

<p>When he kissed me I shrank into my twitching leg and he felt
me shrink and for once I hated my unkindness. He is a very simple
man, my father. He meant this Fortress to be a great symbol of
Herries power--just as Cousin James and Rodney and Grandfather
and Amery are building up their fine Victorian England--but to
lay stone upon stone is not enough. That is a thing that the
building Herries have never understood. I do not believe in God
but I do not think that you can build anything without Him.</p>

<p>My father wishes me to take my proper place here when I am
recovered. He is reformed, he says--no more the rake. We will
attend to farms and property. Yes, but no Herries has ever wanted
to accumulate property. We do not care for it enough. We think
too much of ourselves and will not yield our personal conceit to
anything, not even to property.</p>

<p>And we must get Aunt Judith out of Uldale, he says. And we
must make this house warm, he says. It is always so devilish
cold. He does not know that there is a rat eating away the
foundations. And, when all is said, he loves me like a dog, not
knowing why, and I care for nothing and nobody, not I. It is
something though to see the gold light again lying evenly over
the hills and to hear the stream running down the hill. I have
grown, during my illness, a pale forked beard. I look, in the
glass, like a green radish.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>London, <i>January 14th, 1846</i></p>

<p>Yesterday I had a half-hour of sanity that is worth recording.
I spent it with Grandfather Will. He requested me to pay him a
visit. Why? Even now I do not know. Some intention perhaps of
compensation because he has thrown my father and myself aside for
ever and young Ellis reigns in our stead. (Why Ellis? A dreary,
dry-as-dust, left-over-from-yesterday pantry kind of name, but
its mother has rich cousins thusly.) Nor do I blame him for that.
We are not a pair to be proud of, I suppose. And so I went.
Appalling that house in Hill Street. No rain-washed air sweeping
Blencathra here, but furniture spawning everywhere, masses of it,
heavy and despondent, groaning between thick rep and treading
down the thick Turkey. There are pallid sightless statues and old
Herries gilt-edged on every wall. I was alone in a vast room with
my grandfather, and we crept together for safety. 'Keepsakes'
were our only company. But I am modern for my time. I am a
hundred years hence. I am sickly with the odour of 1950. He is
bent now, his hair white, his clothes fitting him, black and
stiff, as though they were made in a Bank. But in his old age he
is kind and eager. I should judge that this baby is the only
human soul for whom he has ever cared, although he spoke of
Elizabeth's beauty and seeing her alone in this room one day in
the past 'like a vision'. He meant, I fancy, that it could not be
true that she was my sister. He thinks me misshapen and dangerous
and cannot understand that I should be descended from his loins.
Something has gone wrong somewhere and he is bewildered because
he has always done the sensible thing. But he intended to be
kind, sat close to me although I made him creep, and by not
looking at my twitching leg he only looked the more intently. He
asked me how I did. He had heard that I had been ill. He feared
that he would never see Cumberland again although in his youth he
had seen eagles sailing over Glaramara. He has a trick of
fingering his coat-buttons as though they were counting-house
money. He wanted me to tell him something. But what? That things
have not turned out as they should do, his brother Francis a
suicide, his son a drunken fool, his grandson a deformity? Well,
there is little Ellis, and I see as though under glass his heart
beat up again and his old eyes, weary with gazing on figures,
open out at the new hope. Then he is proud of England. It is as
though he had made it, put a hump on Skiddaw here, added a tomb
to Westminster, straightened the Strand, bidden the sea halt in
Norfolk, and run the railway to Newcastle. He is tired, he
explains to me, and then with great courage lays his hot bony
hand on mine.</p>

<p>'For I am seventy-five,' he tells me, 'and have worked hard
all my days.'</p>

<p>He hopes that we are all now reconciled, for there was once a
silly quarrel. Something about a fan. His wife, 'your
grandmother,' was concerned. But that is all so old, so very very
long ago, and he hopes that now all is well. Do I see Judith
Paris often? A remarkable woman with much spirit and character.
And I think of the little Peach children setting a match to Aunt
Judith's parlour, and Aunt Judith slapping my father's face.</p>

<p>But he hopes that all is well. We must be friends, all of us.
Our family must stand together. They mean something to England.
He talks of Palmerston and Peel and the Corn Law crisis and says
the 'rotten potatoes have done it,' and how angry the Duke is and
that Melbourne told the Queen 'that it was a damned dishonest
act,' and that John Russell has come out of it all 'damned
poorly', but they are all dim figures to him now. Ellis aged
three has swallowed up the firmament. He has a little rheumatism
in his legs, he tells me, but otherwise he is well enough, and so
he pulls himself up and slowly, slowly, very stiff and straight,
stamps from the room. And I go down into the street to meet my
waiting double . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ireby, <i>October 9th, 1846</i></p>

<p>I have seen the 'Barguest'. I am a haunted man. I was lost
yesterday afternoon in the wilds between Blencathra and Skiddaw,
Skiddaw Forest way. I do not know where exactly I was. I could
not find the same place again. I had plunged upward, limping and
running and limping again in my own ridiculous fashion, treading
down the dried bracken that in certain lights has almost a glow
of fire running through it. I had looked back and seen Ireby with
its stone turrets, its frowning eyebrow, squat like a
discontented image staring down at Uldale. I looked forward and
the rocks closed me in. They have that fashion here. They move
forward of their own will; you can see them almost scratching
their craggy sides. A moment before there had been the long
swinging slope of bracken, fields below marked off and smelling
rain, the stone wall running straight up into air, a round tufted
tree holding the light, cottages and farms--and now only this
pressing crowding observant rock, the ridge of the hill black
against the October sky save for some little white clouds that
like spies crowded to the ridge and looked over down into the
amphitheatre. I am noting it down thus minutely because of what
then occurred.</p>

<p>I seemed to be able to move neither up nor down; my leg limits
me and I felt as though the slope of rock on which I was standing
would slide down with me--maliciously, while the rocks round me
shook with laughter. And then I saw the Barguest. An old man
shaped like a whale-bone. He came along towards me on his hands
and knees, and once and again he would stop, stare at me, and
bite his long fingernails. But I could see through him; he swayed
like water-mist, was at one time so hazily defined that there
were wisps of him like clouds about the rock, then so sharp that
I could count every button. It was no imagination--or I am mad
perhaps with want of sleep. I stayed transfixed, and he came
right up to me. I could smell his breath, an odour of mushroom
and sodden leaves. He touched me with his long yellow fingernail
and then dispersed into vapour. I know this is so. It is no dream
and, if I am crazy, which for some months now I have suspected,
what is reality? But I am sure that I shall see this place again
and at some fatal time. When the Barguest had vanished I climbed
a stone and all the scenery was restored again, the fields green
in the October sun, and rain-clouds gathering up above the
sea.</p>

<h1><a name="c302">WAX FLOWERS AND THE REVOLUTION</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam tried, with all the self-control that belonged to his
training, to forget what the day after tomorrow meant to him,
but, try as he would, again and again something repeated inside
himself: The day after tomorrow . . . The day after tomorrow.
Everything hangs on Monday, my whole life . . . everything I've
worked for.'</p>

<p>Margaret, in a brown bonnet, hanging on his arm, caught sight
of the magnificent Beadle, whiskered, gold-laced, standing
superbly at the door of the Pantheon Bazaar.</p>

<p>'Oh, let us go into the Pantheon . . . I can find something
there for poor little Daisy Bain, whose foot was crushed by that
wagon last week. It won't occupy us a minute. Do you mind,
Adam?'</p>

<p>They were both making a sublime attempt at proving that
nothing was toward. Today was like any other day. And yet, with
how many thousands around them, they were, it might be, on the
eve of a new era, a new world, a world of light, justice and
brotherhood. All London was making preparation for Monday's great
Chartist rising. All clerks and officials were ordered to be
sworn garrisons. Every gentleman in London was become a
constable. (What a very grand carriage outside the Princess
Theatre, and what a hideous befrilled Pug in the window!)</p>

<p>After all, what an incredible year! In the month of March
alone fearful street fighting in Berlin, flight of the Prince of
Prussia, riots in Vienna and Milan, Hungary in revolt, revolution
in Austria, and, above all, France tumbling either into a chaos
of disaster or a triumph of a new grand order!</p>

<p>And on Monday--Monday, April 10th, 1848--England too might see
the turning-point of all her history. But Margaret had always a
child-like desire for pleasure, and Adam was, nowadays, a great
deal more easily pleased than he had once been. They had walked
out into the mild spring air that they might quiet some of their
almost trembling agitation. How odd it was to see the
bird-stuffer's shop with the birds of paradise and parrots,
crimson and gold and violent green, a statuary shop, with
Canova's Graces, the staymaker's, the fitter's shop with the
little cork ball bounding up and down on the perpendicular jet of
water, the provision shop with the Durham mustard, the Abernethy
biscuits, Iceland moss, Narbonne honey, Bologna sausages--these
and many many more, and to think that in another two days all
these splendours might be at the mercy of the mob, that the poor
might have their wrongs righted, the just come to their own . . .
It must be truthfully added that any stranger seeing Adam and
Margaret as they passed the bowing Beadle at the Pantheon door
would have been astonished indeed at such revolutionary
sentiments, for never did a pair look more respectable and
kindly--Adam, set and solid, with his dark side-whiskers, his
handsome high hat and gentlemanly cravat, and Margaret in her
brown bonnet and overjacket of white embroidered muslin.
Revolutionaries? Surely not this respectable pair!</p>

<p>In fact they did forget for ten minutes inside the Pantheon
that they <i>were</i> revolutionaries. Margaret was so happy to
be alone with Adam for a little that she forgot all else. Adam
was changed since that Christmas at Uldale, more thoughtful, more
demonstrative, but he was constantly preoccupied with his work,
and their rooms were from morning to night crowded with other
people. She did not often have him to herself. She was so happy
that it had been <i>his</i> suggestion that they should take this
walk! He did not often suggest that they should go off somewhere
alone. She sometimes almost wished that there <i>was</i> no
Charter, that that flamboyant boastful Feargus O'Connor had never
been heard of, that she and Adam and her father need not so
continually be considering the wrongs of other people! And the
Pantheon, when they were inside it, was enchanting! First they
went up to the gallery where they might look down on that
exciting coloured maze of babbling children, beautiful ladies,
attendant footmen and subservient shopmen. Behind them (and they
glanced in for a moment) was that queer neglected little
picture-gallery with the dusty twentieth-rate pictures and tragic
Haydon's enormous spectre-like 'Lazarus' dominating with its
fruitless ambition and almost emerging misconceived genius the
atmosphere not only of the Pantheon but the street beyond it, the
people, the carriages, the houses. Once this was a theatre; here
were the Grand Staircase, the Rotunda, the green room, the
conservatories, dressing rooms. Here were <i>Ariadne in Naxos,
Daphnis and Chloe, Bellerophon, The Cruelty of Nero.</i> Old
Will, a stiff prosperous conceited young man of the City, must
here have applauded and Christabel feebly clapped her gloved
hands and old Carey have slumbered! Even the lovely radiant
Jennifer, with her proud parents, must here have been the beauty
of the evening. Judith's Georges must have looked in with a
companion to observe the legs of the chorus; Guimard danced in a
hoop that reached nearly to her ankles. Those were the pigtail
days of Duvernay and Ellsler and Taglioni! Here George III's
eldest son met the lovely Perdita, and Charles Fox in a domino
shouted a tipsy applause!</p>

<p>A church, a waxwork show, an opera, and then one night, in the
middle of <i>Don Giovanni,</i> twelve demons bearing torches of
resin rose to seize the guilty hero, and behold there were
<i>thirteen</i> demons, one of them carrying <i>two</i> torches
and disappearing in a flame of real fire while the audience
fainted and the manager vanished into a madhouse!</p>

<p>But Margaret and Adam were not thinking of the past: the
present and the future were <i>their</i> concern! They were very
young--Adam young for his almost thirty-three years, Margaret
only twenty-eight. Everything was in front of them.</p>

<p>Before they descended from the gallery Adam turned.</p>

<p>'Margaret, are you happy?'</p>

<p>'Very, Adam.'</p>

<p>'You know that you are everything to me now. Whatever happens
on Monday, whatever way things go, nothing can alter that.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know.'</p>

<p>He kissed her and they went down the stairs like a couple of
children. To purchase something for little Daisy Bain was no easy
task, for the variety of toys was extraordinary and the young
ladies at the stalls so <i>very</i> polite and superior. Margaret
was always easily dashed by patronage and had she been alone
would have fled from those elegant young women in dismay, but
Adam confronted them so calmly and with so agreeable a smile that
they were ready to do anything for him. There was the monkey on a
stick, the serpent made of elastic (a compound of glue and
treacle), a centipede at the end of an indiarubber string, and
many another; but best of all were the wax flowers. Oh! how
lovely they were! Margaret clapped her hands when she saw a whole
stall of them! She had no eyes then for the tortoiseshell
card-cases, the pink scented invitation cards with 'on dansera'
in the corner, the muslin slips, the volumes of polkas with
chromo-lithographed frontispieces, the sandalwood fans, the
mother-of-pearl paper-knives with coral spring handles--all these
could be bought at the Pantheon, but she saw only that blazing
bank of colour--crimson, orange, violet, silver--the flowers
smiling from their stalks--carnations, pansies, roses,
lilies-of-the-valley, peonies--their wax petals soft and
iridescent, as fresh, as vernal as though but a moment ago they
had opened their smiling faces to the sun!</p>

<p>'Oh, Adam, are they not marvellous!' she cried. Something then
touched his heart, as though he had never truly loved her before
and as though he were warned that, without realizing his
treasure, it might be, at a moment, lost to him. He would buy the
whole store-load for her! Revolutions, tumbling thrones, the
rights of the poor, these things fell down before the wax flowers
like pasteboard castles!</p>

<p>She chose an assorted bunch--purple pansies, icily white
lilies-of-the-valley, a crimson rose.</p>

<p>'They will live for ever!' she said, smiling into his
eyes.</p>

<p>They were packed very carefully into a box, and lying on
tissue paper looked, Margaret thought, worthy of the Queen.</p>

<p>'They should be kept under glass to preserve them from the
dust,' she said.</p>

<p>The stately young woman who served her smiled with an
exquisite dignity.</p>

<p>'That is generally considered wise, madam,' she remarked.</p>

<p>'Oh, Adam, how kind you are!' Margaret whispered as they
walked away. 'I shall have these all my life long.' Then dropping
her voice, looking at him shyly but with a deep intensity: 'I do
love you so'.</p>

<p>They passed the refreshment counter and enjoyed, each, an
arrowroot cake. Daisy Bain had been quite forgotten, so hurriedly
a doll with flaxen hair was purchased for her. They enjoyed the
conservatory with the fountain that contained the gold and silver
fish, the exotic plants and gay flowers. But it was very hot in
the conservatory, and the parrots and cockatoos made an
intolerable screeching. One cockatoo, as Margaret could not help
observing, strangely resembled Mr Feargus O'Connor and, for a
moment, a dread caught at Margaret's heart. What would happen on
Monday? Was this their last peaceful day? Would they ever be so
happy again? She looked at the box that she carried in her hand
and sighed. She held Adam's arm yet more closely as they passed
out through the waiting-room where some grand ladies were waiting
for their carriages, and so into the light and fresh air of Great
Marlborough Street.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On their return home they found themselves in another world.
Adam discovered suddenly, looking at the room's disorder, the
bottles of beer, the smoke from pipes, books thrown on to the
floor, that he wanted to be out of it all, that his enthusiasm
was dead, that he did not care what happened on Monday, that
there was no Cause any longer. As he saw Margaret moving quietly
into the farther room, carrying the box that held her precious
wax flowers as carefully as though it were glass, he discovered
that with her departure all the light seemed to have gone out of
his world. He had reached some new relation with her during that
half-hour in the Bazaar. She was more precious to him than ever
before.</p>

<p>So with that rather stumbling, halting movement that made him
seem short-sighted, but that was only in reality because his
thoughts were elsewhere, he turned and took in his company. He
saw at once that Henry Lunt held the floor. He would of course in
any place where he was. He was in no way different from the day
when Adam had first met him, still shabby, black, fierce,
denunciatory, self-confident. Adam knew that he was brave and
honest, but he knew also that he was narrow-visioned, foolishly
impetuous, and that his temper was so violent that it was
extremely dangerous. He had been twice gaoled for his share in
riots and disorders: this had not made him either wiser or more
tolerant. He was more conceited than he had been, thought he knew
everything and had all the gifts of leadership; tonight he seemed
to Adam a noisy, tiresome demagogue. There were now too many of
his sort in the movement, and, in fact, the whole impetus seemed
to be slipping away from the Chartists. The Irish potato famine,
the Anti-Corn Law League, above all the exciting spectacular
troubles in Europe, made the Chartist movement a little
old-fashioned. Louis Philippe's fall in February still possessed
men's minds to the diminution of all else. After all, people
said, bad though things were, they were not as bad as in France.
We English are too sensible for Revolutions. We are not of that
kind. Adam agreed with them. The Chartists, especially men of
Lunt's type, appeared now something foreign and affected.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly everyone in the room this evening felt a little of
this. Lunt talked the louder because of it, and, sitting on the
edge of the table, swinging his stout legs, harangued Kraft,
Pider, and Ben Morris and a young Jew, Solomon, as though he
were, with wonderful magnanimity, screwing their courage to the
striking-point.</p>

<p>Pider, it seemed, had said something mildly deprecatory before
Adam came in, and Lunt was all on fire over it.</p>

<p>'Aye,' he was shouting, 'that's just what I was expecting to
hear, Pider. There are too many of your sort about, and that's
the truth. Here we are slaving for years back to bring this thing
about and at last the moment has arrived. The great, magnificent
moment, the climax of all our efforts, and what do you do
but--'</p>

<p>'Yes, but,' Pider broke in, 'suppose the moment hasn't arrived
after all? Suppose Monday's abortive and there's nothing done?
Look at O'Connell!'</p>

<p>'Yes, look at O'Connell!' cried Lunt fiercely, jumping from
the table and waving his short arms. 'He's dead, isn't he? And
deserved to die. They may have given him a fine funeral in
Dublin, but we know what he was, a faint-heart whose courage
failed him just when it was needed. Feargus O'Connor's quite
another sort of man--'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' said Pider doubtfully. 'I've heard men say of
O'Connor--'</p>

<p>'And what have you heard men say of O'Connor?' Lunt shouted.
'There are always men jealous of their leaders, but I tell you
that any man who says O'Connor will fail us is lying in his
throat, and so I'd tell him to his face. I know O'Connor. I've
eaten and slept with him, and a grander, finer leader of men the
world doesn't hold! Answer me that, Pider, and tell me that you
know O'Connor better than I do and I'll tell you it's a
falsehood.'</p>

<p>Pider, who was not lacking in courage and was in no way afraid
of Lunt, started fiercely forward. Kraft came quietly in between
them.</p>

<p>'Now, now,' he said, smiling. 'Where's the good of our arguing
about what will happen on Monday? Who can say how things will
turn? We've done the best we can and must leave the rest to
God.'</p>

<p>'God! God!' Lunt shouted fiercely. 'It isn't God we're
wanting, but confidence in ourselves. I tell you--'</p>

<p>But Kraft gave a sign to Adam and turned off into a little
side-room that he used as a study. Adam followed him and closed
the door behind him. He put his arm round Adam and drew him
close.</p>

<p>'You look weary,' Adam said.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am weary. Their shouting makes me weary. There are
times when I'm sick at heart of the whole thing, times when I
wish that I'd never heard of the Cause at all, and had spent my
days mending watches or keeping sheep in a field.'</p>

<p>'It's not like you,' Adam said, 'to be down.'</p>

<p>'No, maybe it's not. But tonight I have a kind of foreboding,
a sinking of the heart.' He pressed Adam's shoulder. 'What is it,
Adam, creeps into all Causes alike, a kind of worm that eats the
heart out of them? It's a sort of egotism, I suppose. You grow to
think of your own part in it all, to admire your own energy, your
fine speeches, to be jealous of others who are praised, to want
personal rewards. To be impersonal, to care nothing for yourself,
it is the only lesson of life, and no one can learn it!'</p>

<p>'Yes. If there is a lesson!' Adam's dark eyes slowly clouded.
'When you watch the Churches fighting as they are, when you see
Jews like Disraeli bringing off their clever fireworks, while you
watch a sot like Walter Herries at home trying to frighten women
. . . It may be there's no lesson, no plan, no future, no
God--'</p>

<p>Kraft shook his head.</p>

<p>'I feel my immortality,' he said. 'I cannot doubt it, but it
is perhaps a poor kind of immortality. God <i>may</i> be a sort
of flash Jew like Disraeli or a dandy like D'Orsay or a
storyteller like Charles Dickens or a ranter like Lunt--it may be
one long swindle--but it goes on, I <i>know</i> that it goes
on.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Adam continued, nodding his head, 'and emotions like my
present love of Margaret. That's no present from a cheap Jew; or
walking down by Sour Milk Ghyll on a summer evening when the
water is whiter than snow and the hills clouds--D'Orsay couldn't
make <i>such</i> a gift to anyone. But this, Caesar, all this
that we have been working for for years--I see no New Heaven and
New Earth <i>this</i> way. Men don't change. Why do they not
change, Caesar, that's what I want to know? Why do <i>I</i> not
change with all the experience I get? I can remember when I was a
tiny boy bathing one evening in a tarn above Hawkshead. My mother
was there, and an old fat fellow, my uncle Reuben, a sort of
itinerant preacher, who told me stories. He was a wonderful man
as I remember--I daresay he was not in reality. He was killed
after a riot when they tried to burn Uldale down, set on by
Walter Herries. I owe Walter Herries something, you see. But what
was I saying? Oh yes--that night. What was I? Four, five? I don't
know. We lit a fire under the trees, there was a dog, and Uncle
Reuben told me stories. All beauty, all loveliness is in that
night as I look back. Not now. Not here. Not then as I knew it. I
was happy, of course, but recognized nothing extraordinary. But
looking back I see now that there was something divine in that
wood that night. Why,' he burst out, laughing, 'there was
something divine in Pantheon Bazaar this afternoon. My love for
Margaret. Hers for me. Let me recognize it now and offer
D'Orsay-Disraeli-Dickens-Jupiter my thanks for it.'</p>

<p>Kraft smiled.</p>

<p>'What has happened to you, Adam? You are usually so silent.
Words are pouring from you.'</p>

<p>'I know. I'm living at an extra intensity tonight. As though
there were only a thin strip of paper between myself and
discovery--discovery of what? I don't know. D'Orsay's
rouge-pots?'</p>

<p>'I know,' Kraft answered quietly. 'I am the same. It is our
excitement about Monday, I suppose. A Scotsman would say I am
"fey". I can see my shroud, Adam.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sunday night he slept so little and woke so early that while
it was still dark he slipped from Margaret's side, dressed
hurriedly, and went out. He walked through the quiet streets for
some while without thinking of his direction, then found that he
was in the City. Here it was as cool and silent as an oyster. The
wall of the Custom House was a dead wall, the Coal Exchange was
sleeping, but soon he was down on the wharfs where life was
already active and earnest. Here were tubs smelling of oranges,
shops--already opened--packed with salt fish, dried herrings,
Yarmouth bloaters, mussels and periwinkles, dried sprats and
cured pilchards. For he was in Billingsgate. Here the
Billingsgate marketeers were drinking from massive blue and white
earthenware mugs filled to the rough brims with coffee; here
porters were busied clearing piles of baskets away, putting forms
and stools in order, in eager preparation for the fish auction.
The wharf is covered with fish, and the great clock of
Billingsgate booms forth five o'clock. The stands are laden with
salmon, shoals of fresh herring, baskets full of turbot, while
the crowds are gathering thickly, and everyone is shouting and
crying at once.</p>

<p>Adam watched with increasing pleasure. Close to him a fine
fellow stood, a hat tall and shiny as though he were a
habitu&eacute; of Aldridge's Repository, his sporting neckcloth
fastened with a horseshoe pin, while round his giant stomach was
bound the conventional blue apron; he was wearing galligaskins
and straight tight boots of sporting cut. Here were the eight
auctioneers; here Bowler's, Bacon's and Simpson's, the noisiest
taverns (at this hour) in the whole of London. Now was the
excited selling of the 'doubles' and the 'dumbarees'. Fish, fish,
fish! Plaice, soles, haddocks, skate, cod, ling . . . Suddenly he
recollected. My God, this very afternoon, and the gentleman in
the galligaskins and blue apron might find all his occupation
gone! By five of the evening of this very day, all the soles and
cods and haddocks might swim peacefully in the sea for the
attention paid to them! This very street, instead of its stream
of fish-scales, bones and dirty water, might be running in blood!
Instead of gaiety, laughter, money business, there might be
death, ruin, a blaze of fire, smoking catastrophe!</p>

<p>There was a sick dismay at his heart. He had been working for
years with an earnestness and eagerness that had possessed every
energy he had. He had lost in these years much of the fantasy and
humour that had been part of his childhood. At this stage he was
grimly serious, taking nothing lightly. At that moment in the
Billingsgate Market he saw himself as someone fantastically
absurd, working like a labourer at piling brick upon brick, and
as he laboured the bricks turned, before his eyes, to straw.</p>

<p>A joke, a farce, iridescent fish-scales floating down the
teeming gutter. He hurried home.</p>

<p>This morning, Monday, April 10th, was a lovely day, the sun
streaming down with that soft mild radiance that brings a spring
scent of flowers into the London streets. The Chartist detachment
to which Kraft and Adam belonged moved off very early to
Kennington Common. There was no definite procession to the
Common; the Procession, presenting the great Petition, was to
march at least a hundred thousand strong, under the leadership of
Feargus O'Connor, to the Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Here the Petition was to be presented, and what would follow
after was the question on everybody's lips. Men like Lunt
declared that what would follow would be the greatest Revolution
in England since 1688. But how precisely that Revolution would
take place, no one precisely knew. It was true that the Queen and
her Consort were not supremely popular, but no one had anyone to
propose in their place, and even the Lunts of the movement could
not claim that the whole of England was at all ready as yet for a
President or a Dictator.</p>

<p>The very troubles that the rest of Europe were battling with
made many Englishmen proud of their own passivity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a Revolution there would be, some sort of a
Revolution. What the average man, both Chartist and non-Chartist,
feared was that, simply through ill-directed and undisciplined
contact, there would be riot and bloodshed, meaning nothing,
leading nowhere; men perceived, from the recent Paris example,
that one small unexpected event could lead to vast and unexpected
consequences. Let fifty thousand shouting Chartists reach
Westminster . . . Why, then, both sides being armed, some
horrible catastrophe might take the whole civilized world by
surprise. No one in London was happy on that lovely spring
morning and, if the truth were known, most certainly not Mr
Feargus O'Connor himself, who, in spite of his descent from Irish
kings, had no wish to find himself in gaol before the
evening.</p>

<p>Neither Adam nor Kraft was happy. They had one last word
together before they set out.</p>

<p>'I have the oddest feeling,' Kraft said. 'I dreamt last night,
of what I don't know, but I woke saying to myself, "Yes, that's
the answer." Now, I know what it all means. I seemed, in that
brief dream, to have passed through all experience and to have
realized that envy, greed, jealousy, disappointment, lust, bodily
sickness--it was not until I had known them all and tranquilly
accepted them all, that I began to live. Tranquility. I tell you,
Adam, I am as tranquil this morning as a pond-weed. My anxiety is
gone, but my desire too. I cannot imagine what it is that has
agitated me so deeply all these years.'</p>

<p>Adam frowned.</p>

<p>'I am not tranquil. I am afraid of what a parcel of fools are
likely to do before the day's out.'</p>

<p>It was still very early when the three of them reached the
Common. On their way thither they had been impressed by the
silence of the town, as of something strongly on its guard. There
was little traffic in the streets, very few people about and many
of the shops closed. Adam learnt afterwards that many of the
important official buildings round Westminster were defended with
guns and that Whitehall was in reality an armed camp.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the Common they saw that there was the
crowd that had been confidently expected. There were many banners
flaunting devices like 'The Charter, the whole Charter, and
nothing but the Charter,' 'Justice for All Men and No Favour,'
'Up! Up for O'Connor!' and there were a number of brass
bands.</p>

<p>Men, women and children sat and walked about, rather
listlessly, dressed, some of them, in their Sunday clothes, while
others seemed to boast their poverty. There were many pale, thin,
with angry, restless eyes and hungry faces; others appeared to
have come to enjoy the sights. There were some booths with food
and drinks.</p>

<p>Everything was very quiet, there was a murmur of voices, a
sense of expectant waiting as though at any moment a miracle
might break out in the sky above their heads.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival Lunt joined them.</p>

<p>'Not so many as were expected,' Adam said.</p>

<p>'Pooh,' Lunt answered. 'They'll turn up. It will take many of
them time to get here. And this is nothing. You wait until the
Procession starts for Parliament and see how many join us. You
listen to O'Connor when he makes his speech and you'll hear
something.'</p>

<p>Soon it happened that everybody began to press together
towards the centre of the Common and the crush became
uncomfortable; toes were stepped on, umbrellas and sticks poked
into innocent faces, women lost their children, and children were
crying, pockets were freely picked.</p>

<p>Adam saw that it was towards O'Connor and one or two gentlemen
near him that the crowd was thronging, and soon, owing to Kraft's
important position in the movement and the badge that he wore, he
found that they were enclosed in the magic circle. He was so
close to Feargus O'Connor that he could observe him well. A wild
theatrical gentleman, he seemed both over-decorated and shabby,
for he had on the breast of his blue coat a number of ribbons and
medals, but his pantaloons were older than they ought to be and
stained with mud. His hair fell in untidy ringlets from under his
high hat, and he waved with a great deal of excited gesture the
cane that he was carrying. In the other hand he had a stout roll
of paper that was supposed by everyone to be the famous Petition.
He was, it was clear, excellently conscious of the attention that
he was receiving. Once and again he would put up his hand to his
rather soiled cravat, the cane would drop to the ground and be
obsequiously lifted by someone. He would dart his head up rather
as a suspicious hen might do, stare with proud and melancholy
indignation at some small boy who, open-mouthed, was gazing at
him with all his eyes.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had some reason for indignation, for it
seemed that his pocket had been picked. Had anyone ever heard the
like? The leader of the country against tyranny and oppression,
and his pocket had been picked! How much had there been in his
purse? He could not be sure, but a very considerable sum; also a
blue silk handkerchief to which he attached sentimental
value.</p>

<p>But Adam quickly realized that Mr O'Connor was not at all at
his ease. While he talked with an excited and incoherent fervour
his eyes were for ever searching the horizon and searching it
with a kind of terrified preoccupation as though he expected at
any moment to see a large scaly dragon, vomiting fire, issue from
the Kennington trees.</p>

<p>He greeted Kraft absent-mindedly and shook a finger with Adam
(the rest of his hand clutching the sacred roll of paper) without
seeing Adam at all.</p>

<p>He became with every moment more deeply agitated. Beside him
was a long, thin, cadaverous man who looked like a Methodist
clergyman, and a stout, rubicund fellow like a butcher. There was
no sign, however, of any organization or leadership. From time to
time someone broke through into the magic circle, whispered
mysteriously to O'Connor and vanished again. He on his part would
nod his head with great self-importance or shake it or look up to
the heavens or wave his cane. He alluded again and again to the
fact that his pocket had been picked, and once and again would
burst into a fine frenzy, invoking the Deity: 'My God, have I
been chosen to lead these people at this great hour? Have they
come to me hungry and shall they not be fed?' Then, dropping his
voice: 'What is it, Forster? Has Cummin not arrived? Where is
Whitstable? Have they got the thief that has my purse? March to
Westminster? But where are the others? This is not the half of
them! And my toes trodden on and my pocket picked . . .'</p>

<p>The crowd waited with a most exemplary patience. They were, it
seemed, ready to picnic on the Common for the day if necessary.
Many of them, Adam was convinced, were not Chartists at all. Many
were rogues and vagabonds who had come to gather what they might
out of so large a crowd. He saw, as he looked about him, many
incongruous figures, here a rather shabby young dandy in
pea-green gloves and a shirt embroidered with dahlias and
race-horses, then a stout serious-looking gentleman with peg-top
trousers, chin-tuft and eye-glass, and close beside him a sturdy
fellow who might have come straight from the Billingsgate of the
morning, green apron and galligaskins all complete. It could not
be said to be a very murderous crowd, and, as Adam looked, his
fears of red revolution died away. There would be no revolution
here. But for what then all these years had he been working? Not
for revolution certainly, but also not for a contented humorous
crowd like this. He drew Margaret's arm through his and waited
for what might come.</p>

<p>What soon came was an excited stir through the crowd. It
whispered like wind through corn. Someone had arrived. Something
had occurred. Two men pushed through and spoke to O'Connor; at
once his countenance turned red and then white again. He dropped
his cane and no one picked it up. He stood, hesitating, his head
turning first this way, then that.</p>

<p>The crowd was dividing; it was the Constable, Mr Mayne,
followed by three of his inspectors. Mayne, a fine,
resolute-looking man, took his stand a little way from Adam, and
sent one of his inspectors forward to O'Connor. It was clear that
O'Connor was in a terrible fright. 'Afraid of arrest,' whispered
Kraft contemptuously to Adam. O'Connor, after a second's
hesitation, clutched his cane and roll of paper and went to meet
Mr Mayne. The two men made a striking contrast, and in that
moment of seeing them together, it seemed to Adam that any alarms
or hopes on the part of anyone that Revolution would ever again
break out in England were finally dissolved.</p>

<p>'Mr O'Connor,' said Mayne, 'I am here to inform you that the
meeting on this Common is permitted, but no procession to
Westminster.'</p>

<p>O'Connor said something.</p>

<p>'No. No procession whatever.'</p>

<p>O'Connor spoke again.</p>

<p>'Certainly, Mr O'Connor, I am very pleased to hear it.'</p>

<p>O'Connor held out his hand; Mr Mayne shook it.</p>

<p>The Revolution was over.</p>

<p>Mayne, with his inspectors, disappeared, and O'Connor came
forward to address the crowd. There were stands with flags and
banners for him to appear on, and he did step up on to one of
them, attended by some half a dozen gentlemen, but very little
that he said could be heard. It appeared that he himself was
going to the Home Office that he might present the famous
Petition there; there would, however, be no procession; in fact,
everything was over, or rather, the Meeting might continue as
long as it pleased, but he, Mr O'Connor, would not appear in
it.</p>

<p>He vanished, and there followed an extraordinary scene. Many
of the more peaceful citizens, laughing and jeering, turned to
leave the Common, but at the same time crowds of roughs and
hooligans, urged on by the more violent Chartists, drove their
way towards the stands with shouts and threats. Women were
screaming, children crying, men shouting, no one seemed to be in
command, someone tore down two of the banners.</p>

<p>'We had best be out of this,' Adam said, turning to Margaret.
Then he saw Lunt. The man seemed to be in a frenzy and was
orating, waving his hands, his hat off, his face congested with
anger. In his hand he carried a short, thick club.</p>

<p>'Come,' said Kraft sadly. 'The curtain is down. The play is
over.'</p>

<p>They turned together, but at the same moment Lunt caught sight
of them. Like a madman he rushed at them, stopped in front of
Kraft and shouted:</p>

<p>'Now where are you? You white, shaking coward! You and your
friends! This is your work, with your psalm-singing,
chicken-hearted caution! You have brought England to her knees,
sold us like slaves!'</p>

<p>Kraft said quietly: 'Come, Henry. This is a farce.'</p>

<p>'Farce!' Lunt screamed. 'Yes! and who has turned it into a
farce?'</p>

<p>'You and others like you,' Kraft answered sternly, his voice
ringing out so that all heard him. 'I have warned you again and
again, but you would not listen. With your violence you have
frightened most decent men away. Aye, and lost most of our
battles before they were even fought.'</p>

<p>Lunt's shouts had drawn a large crowd about them. Some excited
men pressed forward, shouting incoherently, some laughed, some
agreed with Kraft. But Lunt was beside himself; he moved in a
whirlwind of passion in which he could distinguish nothing but
his own disappointment, the failure of all that his egotism, yes,
and his melodramatic self-sacrifice had for years been planning.
He closed up to Kraft, who did not move.</p>

<p>'By heaven!' he shouted, 'I will show you who is a traitor!
I'll teach your dirty cowardice!'</p>

<p>Kraft caught his arm.</p>

<p>'Be ashamed, man!' he cried. 'Go home to your wife and
children!'</p>

<p>The touch infuriated Lunt, who thrust himself free, swung his
club and brought it crashing on to Kraft's head. Kraft fell, his
hand catching at Margaret's dress as he went down. Instantly
there was silence. It was as though a hand caught the Common, the
crowd, the sunlight, and, crushing it all into nothing, flung it
away. There was emptiness and the sun shining on Kraft's white
shirt and his twisted hand.</p>

<p>Adam was on his knees, his arm under Kraft's head that was
crooked and veiled in blood. He looked up. 'A surgeon!' he said.
'For God's sake, someone, quickly, a surgeon.'</p>

<p>But he knew that Kraft was dead--the finest man in the world
was gone. Tears blinded his sight as he bent again to the
ground.</p>

<h1><a name="c303">CHILDE ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>This was one of Judith's good days. This year, 1850, had not
opened too well for her. For one thing in January she had had a
splendid quarrel with Dorothy, had slapped Amabel (now a big
stout girl of eleven) for riding one of the calves, had ordered
Dorothy out of the house, had been told by Dorothy that she would
not go, had discovered old Peach talking to one of her maids, had
dismissed the maid and been of a mind to go up to the Fortress
and tell Walter what she thought of him.</p>

<p>When this lively afternoon was over she had gone to bed, lain
on her back and laughed aloud at her own bad temper. Dorothy had
come in later to make the peace and discovered the old lady
sitting up in bed, her lace cap a little askew on her snow-white
hair, laughing and doing household accounts. They had embraced,
as they always did after a quarrel, and Judith had settled down
to the reading of Mr Thackeray's <i>Vanity Fair.</i> She had a
passion now for novels, although she considered Thackeray too
sentimental and something of a hypocrite. Becky, however, she
could thoroughly enjoy and considered that there, but for the
grace of God, went Judith Paris. Amelia and Dobbin she could not
abide, but Rawdon had quite a deal in common with her dear
Georges, who was as close to her still as he had been in
1790.</p>

<p>At the end of a chapter she had blown out the candle and lain
down to sleep. She had slept for an hour or so and then woken
suddenly to a sharp pain in the side. It was the first sharp pain
she had ever known and she greeted it humorously as much as to
say, 'Well, I knew you would come sometime. Now that you are
here, behave as a gentleman.' The pain behaved badly at first and
then, like a new acquaintance, having left his card, departed.
But in the morning she felt very unwell indeed, tried to get up
but could not, was finally in bed for a week. She was attended by
Dr Fairchild from Keswick, a little wizened sarcastic man of
middle age. They got on very well, were rude to one another,
gossiped a good deal, and found that they had much in common.</p>

<p>He told her that she had the rheumatics and he put her on a
diet. It was from this moment that she began to care about food.
Food had never, all her life, been very important to her. She had
always had a healthy appetite and took what came. But now that
she was forbidden, she lusted. She liked to forbid herself, but
hated that anyone else should forbid her anything. Moreover, Dr
Fairchild, with a deliberate maliciousness, as it seemed to her,
forbade her the very things for which she cared the most, and
especially meat. She had encountered at odd times cranky persons
who pretended to live entirely on vegetables. There was poor
young Ivison, son of Mr Ivison the bookseller in Keswick, whose
pale earnest countenance both amused and irritated her. It was
said that he ate nothing but carrots and cabbage, and once, when
she met the poor thin boy beside Mr Flintoft's Model of the Lake
District, he had incontinently fainted there at her feet! So much
for carrots and cabbages.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she did on the whole as she was told, and now,
at the beginning of March, was in fine vigour again. Her spirits
were all the livelier, because just at this time John was given a
holiday and came up with Elizabeth on a visit. It was a year and
a half since they had been at Uldale. The house was very full and
she adored it to be full. Dorothy's children were
growing--Timothy was thirteen, Veronica twelve, Amabel eleven,
and Jane (Judith's especial pet) was nine. Old Rackstraw taught
Timothy Latin, and there was a governess, Miss Meredith. Miss
Meredith Judith did not like at all, but she could not deny that
she was an excellent governess. Miss Meredith, who was round and
plump like a barrel, had all the present popular
conventionalities. It was Judith's constant delight to shock her,
for Judith could not in the least understand this great wave of
propriety that had swept over the country. To allude to legs or
bosoms or ardent young men or any of the processes of human
creation seemed to Miss Meredith like death, and Judith perceived
that not only Dorothy but the little girls themselves approved of
these reticences.</p>

<p>'But, my dear Dorothy,' Judith would say, 'what is there
shocking about being born? Why, I remember at Stone Ends when I
was a girl--'</p>

<p>'When you were a girl, Aunt Judith,' Dorothy answered firmly,
'the world was a very different place. Not civilized at all.'</p>

<p>'I am sure,' Judith retorted, 'I can't say about being
civilized, but babies are born in exactly the same way now as
they were then. It would do Miss Meredith all the good in the
world to be flung into a hedge by a tramp--'</p>

<p>But Dorothy was so greatly distressed that Judith
desisted.</p>

<p>'<i>Please</i>, Aunt Judith,' Dorothy said. 'Do not offend
Miss Meredith. She is the best governess in the world. Exactly
right for the children. I don't know where we'd ever find such
another.'</p>

<p>So Judith refrained, and only teased Miss Meredith when the
temptation was quite irresistible.</p>

<p>She loved the house to be full, for she knew that she was a
miracle for her age. Dorothy, with all her energy and obstinacy,
had no say whatever in the running of the house. And Judith was
not at all the conventional tyrannical old woman so common in
works of fiction from the days of the Egyptians and maybe long
before them. Everyone loved her. She was cared for now as she had
never been in all her life before. How in the past she had longed
to be liked! How it had hurt her when Will had disapproved and
Will's mother hated her and Jennifer plotted against her! But
now, when she had all the love that she could possibly desire,
she did not greatly care for it. She hated sentiment and always
preferred common sense.</p>

<p>Adam, of course, was a thing apart; she was deeply fond of
John and Elizabeth, had an affection for Dorothy and the
children, but, with the possible exception of little Jane, Adam
was the only human being in the world whom she loved.</p>

<p>She certainly did not love herself, but she was proud of her
age, her strength, her capability and, above all, her scorn for
and successful battles over everyone at Ireby.</p>

<p>Of late Walter had been trying to irritate her in every way
that he knew. Things were stolen, her house was spied upon, her
servants were bribed, if there was any malicious story possible
about anyone at Uldale it was spread in every direction. But
Judith and Dorothy were exactly the women to fight a campaign
like Walter's. They had much common sense and a strong feeling
for the ludicrous. Dorothy was lacking in a sense of humour, but
her sense of fun was so strong that to see a gentleman slip on
the ice or a lady lose her bonnet in the wind made her stout
sides ache with laughter.</p>

<p>So Walter seemed to her silly and Uhland unwholesome.</p>

<p>On this sunny day in March the weather was so warm that John
and Elizabeth could walk comfortably up and down the lawn
together. Judith, looking at them for a moment out of the parlour
window, smiled with approval. John the night before had been most
entertaining. If not of Parliament he was near it enough to have
plenty of inside information. Both Judith and Dorothy were
thrilled with interest as he told them of the hatred that the
Queen and Prince Albert felt for Palmerston. Palmerston was
John's hero, so he was a trifle malicious about the Queen and the
Prince. Lord Clarendon, it seemed, had, a few weeks ago, dined at
the Palace, and now it was all over the Town that the Queen in
the drawing room after dinner had lost all control and spoken
with so much vehement bitterness that Lord Clarendon had not
known where to look; and when she had done the Prince had begun
and, when Clarendon had visited him next day, had orated about
Palmerston for two hours without stopping.</p>

<p>This gave the two ladies great pleasure to hear, not because
they wished the Queen or Palmerston or anyone else any harm;
simply that it brought the lawns and hedges of Uldale straight
into the Palace.</p>

<p>So Judith looked out of the window at John and nodded her
approval. It was so fine a morning that she had put on a new
dress for the first time, a dress made especially for her by Miss
Sampson in Keswick. She wore more sombre colours now, although
she still loved a touch of brightness here and there. As she was
wearing long drawers trimmed with lace, a flannel petticoat, an
under-petticoat, a white starched petticoat, and two muslin
petticoats under the dress, she had, for an old lady, a good deal
to carry. Very soon now the stiff bands of the crinoline were to
relieve ladies of their outrageous burden. Judith was wearing a
dress of grey taffeta with twelve flounces all of a dark shade of
green. Out of this 'like a lily-stem out of a flower-tub' rose
her dark-green bodice with pagoda sleeves and a very lovely white
lace collar (this last a present from Sylvia Herries the
preceding Christmas). Her only concession to her years was her
white lace cap. Her small, alert, vigorous body carried its
cumbrous clothes with grace and ease; her eyes sparkled like
little fires. She had, as she had always had, an air of
crystalline spotlessness. The muslins, the collar, the cap were
new minted as though direct, that minute, from some most perfect
laundry. And so in fact they were. Everything was laundered in
the house and Mrs Kaplan the housekeeper (Judith's slave) saw
that all was perfection.</p>

<p>They were rich now at Uldale. Dorothy had money from Bellairs
and her portion of Herries money. Judith's own investments,
shares in Liverpool concerns inherited from David Herries, land
and property round Uldale excellently supervised for many years
by Rackstraw, all mounted to an income well beyond their needs.
Judith had no desire for wealth, but she liked to have everything
handsome about her. Everything <i>was</i> handsome. On this
lovely March morning Uldale glistened like a jewel.</p>

<p>She went her rounds of the house, tapping with her stick and
humming a tune. She visited everything, the high-ceilinged
kitchen, pantry, servants' hall, housekeeper's room complete with
black cat, work-basket and flowered footstool. Then, perhaps,
after the dairy the place that she loved best, the still-room.
Here were cakes, jams, preserves made; here was the china washed
and the dessert set out. Then the lamp-room, the store-room, the
meat-larder where were the weighing machine and the great
pickling jars. Then the wood and coal stores, the laundry, the
pump-room and the dairy. She stayed for an especial time this
morning in the kitchen, for its brick-floored spaciousness bathed
in sun was exceedingly pleasant. She stood there, smiling at the
maids, leaning on her stick, looking at the roasting-spits, the
Dutch oven, the chopping-block, the sugar-nippers, the
coffee-grinder, the pot and pan racks, everything shining,
gleaming, glittering as though active and happy with conscious,
individual life.</p>

<p>All was good; all was well; still humming her tune she went
out on to the sunlit lawn to find John and Elizabeth.</p>

<p>For a moment she looked back at the house--dear house to whose
safety and comfort she had, through all her long life, returned
again and again. There had been terrible hours here. She could
see David Herries fallen, stricken on this very lawn, she could
catch again Sarah Herries' distracted glance, could see Jennifer
waiting for her lover, Francis' mad return and frantic exit, the
rioters and poor Reuben's slaughter, her own tragic surrender of
Watendlath, the Christmas party and the fracas with Walter. There
had been every kind of tragedy, farce, drama here; birth, death,
ruin, love, humour, light easy days, pain and laughter. She had
come through it all, as one always did come through if one kept
on patiently enough, did not take oneself too seriously, saw the
sequence of event, of change, decay and birth in proper
proportion. One came through to this sunlight, to this lovely
landscape, this quiet English calm; then, turning, she saw that
John was walking towards her and, with that quick intuition that
she always had, wondered instantly whether after all the tale was
told, whether there were not a number more of chapters to be
added.</p>

<p>For John was alone and, she saw at once, in trouble. She had
never quite understood John. She had loved Francis, his father,
but had never understood him either. The alarms, fears,
superstitions, doubts of those two were foreign to her direct
sensible nature. The part of her that had shared them she had
deliberately killed.</p>

<p>John's slim, upright body, his pale hair, beautiful almost
feminine features, had always marked him apart from other men.
She thought, as she saw him approach her: 'John will never be out
of trouble. He will never know what it is to rest.'</p>

<p>He came straight up to her and, his voice quivering a little,
said:</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith. I have told Elizabeth I am going up to
Ireby.'</p>

<p>She was astonished. A long grey shadow seemed to fall across
the sunny lawn.</p>

<p>'Yes. Didn't you know? He has written her a letter: that
scoundrel Peach brought it half an hour ago.'</p>

<p>'A letter?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Here it is.'</p>

<p>He handed her a large sheet of paper scrawled over in Walter's
big clumsy hand.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR ELIZABETH--As a dutiful daughter you are to pay me a
visit. If you don't come of yourself I shall fetch you. Your
loving father,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">WALTER HERRIES</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Loving father!' said Judith, her voice shaking with anger.
'What impertinence!'</p>

<p>'Yes. But of course Elizabeth mustn't go. She wished it, and I
forbade her even to think of it. But <i>I</i> am going--and at
once.'</p>

<p>As she looked at him he was again the small boy when the nurse
had thrown the rabbit out of the window. He stood there, his head
up, his nostrils quivering (exaggerated pictures of him, she
thought, but spiritually true), like a high-bred horse, defiant
but afraid of the whip because of the catastrophe that a contact
might bring. She, too, was afraid of some disaster. She knew, as
she looked at him, that she had always been afraid of it for
him.</p>

<p>'No. Don't you go, John. I'll pay him a visit. I've been
wishing to for weeks.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' John said roughly. Then, recovering himself,
added: 'Pardon me, Aunt Judith. I didn't intend to be rude, but
this is <i>my</i> affair. You must see that it is--'</p>

<p>She did not attempt to stop him after this, but only sighed to
herself as she saw him mount his bay, wave his riding-whip to
her, turning with that charming, rather weak, altogether lovable
smile that was so like his father's that it always made her heart
ache.</p>

<p>Where would this thing end, she thought, as she entered the
house. When had it begun?--back, back, maybe to the days when her
father had been a wild young man and sold his woman at the Fair,
an old eternal quarrel between beauty and ugliness, normality and
abnormality, sense and nonsense--a quarrel born, as all quarrels
are in this world, of jealousy and fear. But she did not care for
philosophy; she took things as they came, and what immediately
came now when she entered the house was a quarrel with Dorothy,
who wished to buy a sofa covered with wool-work and fringed with
beads that she had seen in Carlisle. To buy this monstrosity and
place it in the parlour instead of the lovely old one that had
the red apples.</p>

<p>'But it's all the mode!' cried Dorothy. The Osmastons have
wool-work everywhere.'</p>

<p>'They may,' said Judith grimly, 'but so long as I'm up and
about that sofa remains in the parlour. Why, I was resting my
hand on it when I came to the most important decision of my
life.' Then she added as she tapped away on her stick: 'It's all
Prince Albert and his German taste. I detest the man.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile John rode down the road towards Ireby. It suited his
mood that the sky became overcast as he reached the bottom of the
Ireby hill. On his left a bubble of seething little white clouds
rose on the Skiddaw ridge, and other clouds rushed up to the sun
and, with gestures of sulky annoyance, swallowed it. He
<i>hated</i> himself for this fear that had seized all his bones
like water. The very thought of Uhland made him sick. But perhaps
Uhland would not be there. He did not mind Walter at all; he was
simply a gross, quarrelsome, bad-mannered fool. His thoughts went
back to that day in his childhood when, with Adam, he had watched
Walter on the moor. He had been afraid then, but he saw now that
it had been Uhland's shadow behind Walter that had, like a
prophecy, frightened him. He had been afraid of Uhland before he
was born.</p>

<p>He tried now, as he rode slowly up the hill, to formulate that
fear, to bring it into the open. But it would not come. That was
the awful thing about it. When he forced himself to think of
Uhland, or was compelled to do so, he saw him as a shapeless,
boneless animal emitting some sickening odour, as one sees a
creature in a dream, lurking in shadow in a dank cave or the
corner of a cellar, or behind a stone. The hide-and-seek that
Uhland had played with him now for so long had introduced into
his own soul and body some sickly element, so that, at times, he
believed that Uhland was some part of himself--that part we all
have, hidden, shameful, lurking. There was nothing shameful in
his life except this one cowardice. In everything else he was
brave, and so all the more did he feel this one exception to be
real.</p>

<p>He raised his head as he saw the grey stone house squatting,
in its trees, on the top of the hill. Today he would force this
thing into the open; it should skulk, just out of touch and
feeling, no longer.</p>

<p>He tied his horse to the wall outside the garden and walked up
the flagged path to the door. Stone frowned at him
everywhere.</p>

<p>The gardens were trim but dead. It was late March, and the
daffodils were in full golden flood under the rosy Uldale walls.
Here, too, beneath the dark trees beyond the flowerbeds they
flamed in little cups of fire, but the garden itself was black
and gritty. As John stood there banging the knocker of the door,
the whole place leered down on him.</p>

<p>It was not that it was so large, but that it was so dead. The
windows had no faces, the stone turrets were like clenched fists,
and worst of all, there was no sound at all anywhere.</p>

<p>At Uldale there was always sound--laughter, singing, running
water and the light chatter of birds. He wondered, above the
beating of his heart, that there was not a bird singing in the
Ireby gardens.</p>

<p>At last there was a creaking of bolts and the door slowly
opened. An old bent man whom John had never seen before stood
there; he had bow legs and was dressed in the style of thirty
years earlier, black worsted stockings, black knee-breeches, a
rather soiled neckerchief, and a dull brown tye-wig that cocked a
little over one eye. He had a tooth missing, and his words
whistled through his lips.</p>

<p>'Is Mr Walter Herries at home?' John asked.</p>

<p>'If you'll wait I'll see,' said the old man, looking out into
the garden as though he expected to see a lion rooting up the
bulbs. 'What name shall I say?'</p>

<p>'Mr John Herries.'</p>

<p>His mind seemed to be on other things as he ambled away,
leaving John in the hall. The hall was stony and bare. There was
a fireplace with grinning fire-dogs and a large stand hung with
heavy coats and stacked with whips. There was no carpet on the
stone that struck the feet icily. He stood there, wondering
whether the old man would not forget him, when a green baize door
to his left opened and a woman came out. She was not young but
not old either, and very extravagantly dressed in a Russian short
jacket of gold brocade figured with bunches of flowers in
coloured silks. Her skirt had so many flounces that she appeared
to be robed ten times over. She wore a bonnet lined with
rosebuds, and her cheeks were rosebuds too, only extremely
artificial, for John had never seen a lady more brightly painted.
This brilliant person brushed past him as though he were not
there, and she was swearing like a trooper. She turned towards
the stairs and shouted:</p>

<p>'Hell take your meanness, Walter!'</p>

<p>She was so angry that she stared at John without seeing
him.</p>

<p>As though from nowhere a very large stout man in a nightcap
and a rich flowered dressing-gown appeared on the stairs. He was
grinning, his nightshirt was open at the neck and he carried a
very small brown hairy dog in one hand by the scruff of its neck.
Very good-humouredly he called out, leaning with his free hand on
the banister: 'Au revoir, my dearest,' and threw the dog to the
lady. John started forward, but the lady was quicker, caught the
dog with wonderful dexterity, and rushed from the house, banging
the door behind her.</p>

<p>Walter wiped his large hands in a handkerchief that very
deliberately he took from his dressing-gown. He was about to
vanish when John called out:</p>

<p>'Cousin Walter.'</p>

<p>He peered forward down into the dark hall.</p>

<p>'Hullo. Who's there?' he asked.</p>

<p>'John Herries. I wish to have a word with you.'</p>

<p>Walter came slowly down the stairs, drawing his dressing-gown
about him, his slippers tip-tapping. He came right up to John and
bent forward, peering at him.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's you, is it?' he said at last. 'Where's my
daughter?'</p>

<p>He was very clean-shaved, and his cheeks, round and rosy,
shone like a baby's and smelt freshly of some scent. His face was
fat, but his neck and exposed chest were white and firm. His
mouth, eyes, and thin hair protruding from the night-cap gave him
the look of age, for he was only fifteen years older than John in
reality, but looked quite of another generation. His body was of
great size and had a balloon-like appearance under the
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>'May I speak to you?' asked John.</p>

<p>'You may,' said Walter quite amiably. 'Come upstairs.'</p>

<p>John mounted after him, and Walter led the way into a room
that was as untidy and uncomfortable as a room could be. There
was a spitting, smoky little fire in the grate; a carpet, red
with a buff pattern and a large tear, in front of the fireplace;
two pier-glasses; a wool-work ottoman and a large harp leaning
against the wall. The room smelt of caraway-seed and was very
close.</p>

<p>Walter, his legs stretched, stood in front of the fireplace
and motioned John to a seat.</p>

<p>'If you're cold,' he said, 'I can't help it. Didn't know you
were coming. Have a brandy.'</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' said John, turning his hat round and round in
his hands.</p>

<p>'Well, what do you want now that you are here?'</p>

<p>'You wrote a letter to my wife. I am here to answer it.'</p>

<p>Walter scratched his head under his night-cap and grinned.
Then he sat down in a large faded green leather chair and
stretched out his thick hairy legs, kicking off one slipper and
crinkling up his toes.</p>

<p>'Forgive my attire, Cousin John,' he said. 'That bitch of a
woman put me out this morning--and now I've put <i>her</i> out.'
He threw his head back and laughed. 'Have a brandy. Pray, have a
brandy,' he said again.</p>

<p>'No, I thank you,' said John very ceremoniously.</p>

<p>'Well, I will.' He pulled an old red worsted bell-rope and so
still was the house that the clang of the bell could be heard
echoing, echoing into eternity. 'Now then,' he said, 'why isn't
my daughter here?'</p>

<p>'She is not here, neither is she coming.'</p>

<p>'Well, that's straight enough. But she <i>is</i> coming if I
want her.'</p>

<p>'You have no sort of right to her,' John answered hotly. He
was glad if he was getting angry. That made him less conscious of
the silent house, less aware of his own anticipation of Uhland's
entrance.</p>

<p>'And why have I no right? I'm her father, aren't I?'</p>

<p>'You ill-treated her, and then when she ran away because she
was so miserable you made no kind of inquiry as to her
whereabouts. She might have died for all you cared.'</p>

<p>Walter yawned, scratched his breast, leaned forward, shaking a
fist.</p>

<p>'Look you here, Cousin John. Let me tell you something. You
are in danger, you are. It began with your mother, who was
impertinent to my mother. I gave her a warning, but she wouldn't
listen, and I frightened her into her grave. When she was gone I
warned you that you'd better be after her--all of you. But you
wouldn't take the warning, and, more than that, you have the
damned impertinence to marry my daughter--'gainst my wishes too.
I don't bear you a grudge. I don't bear anyone in this world a
grudge except my old father who goes cohabiting with a woman
young enough to be his daughter and gets a child by her.
Disgustin'--simply disgustin'. No, I don't wish you ill, but I've
been telling the lot of you these years back to move out of
Uldale, and you will not listen. You are in danger, Cousin John,
and if you won't drink a brandy like a gentleman you'd better be
off. I've had an irritating time already this morning, and I
don't want another.'</p>

<p>'You needn't think,' said John, getting up, 'that we are
afraid of you. We know all the dirty little games you've been
playing, putting Peach on to rob and spy, bribing the servants,
but it doesn't affect us, not an atom.'</p>

<p>'Does it not?' said Walter cheerfully. 'No, because you've
that old woman in the house. She's a hard-plucked one, she is.
I've been fighting her for years, and upon my soul there is no
one in the world I admire more. But it won't go on for ever, you
know. Dear me, no. There'll be a nasty family crisis one of these
days. You can tell the old lady so.'</p>

<p>The old bow-legged man with the brown wig arrived with a
bottle and two glasses. Walter filled one tumbler half full and
drank it off.</p>

<p>'That's better,' he said. 'And now you'd better be going.'</p>

<p>He got up and shuffled his great body across the room,
yawning, scratching his back, his night-cap tilted over one
ear.</p>

<p>'Dam' bitch,' he said. 'I wish I'd broken the bones of that
dog.' He kicked the harp with the toe of his slipper. That was
her doing,' he said, jerking his head. Thought she could play on
it. Forced me to order the thing from Carlisle . . .' He swung
round at the door.</p>

<p>'Uhland hates you, you know,' he said, grinning like a
schoolboy. 'Hates you like a poison. Don't know why. Always
has.'</p>

<p>John said nothing.</p>

<p>In the passage Walter said:</p>

<p>'Ever been over this house? Chilly place. Draughty as hell.'
He threw open a double door. This was the salon where the fine
opening Ball had been given. Here were the tapestries, and the
decorations, hanging garlands and the dazzling stars of heaven.
But the floor was filmed with dust, there was a large patch in
the gilded ceiling, a corner of the tapestry flapped drearily
against the wall, a chair was overturned, and there were
bird-droppings on the long windowsill.</p>

<p>'Fine room,' said Walter. Then, closing the doors behind him,
he said: 'There are rooms and rooms in this place. Too many
rooms.'</p>

<p>Somewhere a dog was howling and a door banged, monotonously,
like a protest.</p>

<p>'Goodbye, then,' said Walter, nodding. 'I am sure I don't know
why you came.'</p>

<p>'I came in answer to your letter.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes. Well, it's my daughter I wish to see. No one
else.'</p>

<p>'I came to tell you that. That she will not come.'</p>

<p>'Yes.' He nodded. 'She will, though--if I want her. Damn that
dog. There's no peace in this house.' He shuffled off,
disappearing quite suddenly. And he was replaced, for John,
hearing a sound, looked to the left, and there on the stone step
of a little winding stair stood Uhland..</p>

<p>He said nothing. He was dressed in black, with a single
flashing diamond in his stock. He said nothing, he turned back up
the staircase, tapping with his stick. And John followed him. The
silence of the house, broken only by the distant yapping of the
dog, compelled him, and the film of dust that seemed to be
floating everywhere in the house compelled him. But he went
because he was ashamed not to go; the fear that so maliciously
squeezed his heart would mock at him all his life long if he did
not go. And he went because Uhland wanted him to go.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the top of the little stone staircase the tapping stick led
him through an open door into Uhland's room. This was furnished
with a four-poster, a parrot in a cage, a sheepdog lying on the
floor by the window, a grand view straight down the hillside to
Uldale, a bookcase, a pair of foils and a bare shabby table and
two old brown chairs.</p>

<p>Uhland stood in the middle of the room and looked at him.</p>

<p>'And pray what have you come for?' he asked him.</p>

<p>They faced one another for the first time, as it seemed, for
many years, and even now John could not bring this face and body
to any definite terms. It was indistinct, floating in dust,
wavering into space. The room smelt of animals, the bed was
unmade, the sheets tossed about. The sheepdog paid them no
attention, but slowly licked a paw that was wrapped in very fresh
white linen.</p>

<p>John was not indistinct to Uhland. He hated, as he looked,
every particle of him; the high aristocratic carriage of his
head, his gentle amiable eyes, his handsome clothes and, most of
all, he both hated and loved his fear of himself. He drew lines
with his stick on the worn dusty carpet.</p>

<p>'What have you come for?' he asked again.</p>

<p>John's words stuck in his throat; he could not help himself.
It may have been the close air and animal smell. He forced
himself, as though he were beating with his foot on the floor, to
speak.</p>

<p>'I came to see your father about a private affair,' he said at
last. 'But now I am here I should wish to know what the hell you
mean by following me, spying on me in London and elsewhere during
these last years?'</p>

<p>'Ah, you've noticed that, have you?' said Uhland.</p>

<p>They both knew that it would need only a gesture, a careless
movement, for them to be at one another's throats. If Uhland had
not been lame, John must have sprung forward, and oh! the relief
that that would be, the clearing away, as one sweeps off cobwebs,
of years of dreams, nightmares, shame and terror. But he could
not touch a cripple, and, more than that, as Uhland drew lines
with his stick on the floor, he seemed to place a barrier between
them.</p>

<p>'Well,' Uhland said, 'it has amused me to make you
uncomfortable. You are such a coward, so poor a creature, that
anything can frighten you. And you had the impertinence to marry
my sister.'</p>

<p>'If you were not lame,' said John, 'I would show you whether I
am a coward or no.'</p>

<p>'Ah, don't allow that to stop you. Lame though I am, I can
look after myself. You have always been a coward. Everyone knows
it.'</p>

<p>'If you were not Elizabeth's brother--'</p>

<p>'Another excuse.'</p>

<p>John drew a deep breath. He could not help himself, but this
thick close air made the room swing about him. Uhland's stick
hypnotized him.</p>

<p>'I'll show you--' he began. 'If I am disturbed by you any more
I shall forget your weakness and make you sorry you were ever
born. I've warned you. I won't warn you again.'</p>

<p>He turned to go. He saw the dog raise its head, heard the
parrot scratch the bars, then knew that the closeness of the room
gripped his windpipe, darkened his eyes. The floor swirled up
like a wave and struck him. He fainted, sinking limply back
against the legs of the chair.</p>

<p>Uhland looked at him, hesitated, then went to the
washing-basin, fetched the jug and bent down, his arm under
John's body, splashing his forehead with the water.</p>

<p>He had John's body in his arms. He put his hand beneath his
shirt and felt the smooth firm warm skin above the heart. He drew
the body close to his own, and his long thin fingers passed over
the face, the neck, the open shirt. His own heart was beating
tumultuously. With one hand he very gently bathed the forehead
just as he bathed one of his wounded animals, with the other he
pressed his fingers on the mouth, felt the warm lips under his
touch, stroked the strong throat, looking always into the
eyes.</p>

<p>His hand pressed more intently on the mouth; then he shuddered
through all his body. He saw that John's eyes were slowly,
dazedly opening, so he drew away, letting the other collapse
against the chair. He got up, threw a look about the room, and,
very quietly, went out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c304">EXHIBITION</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>'I am as excited as a child,' said Judith.</p>

<p>'You <i>are</i> a child,' answered Dorothy severely. 'Do wrap
your shawl more closely or you will catch the most dreadful
chill.'</p>

<p>'Chill--pooh!' said Judith, leaning over the edge of Will's
most handsome carriage that she might see the better an
extraordinary Frenchman in beard, felt hat and full
pantaloons.</p>

<p>They had come to London to stay with Will for the opening of
the Great Exhibition.</p>

<p>Long before their departure from Cumberland the Exhibition had
penetrated their seclusion. For weeks and weeks no one in
Keswick, Bassenthwaite, Cockermouth, Buttermere Valley, Penrith
or anywhere else had had any other thought but of the Exhibition
and the possibilities of a visit to London. Old Bennett, for
example, had received from somewhere in London a plan of a
monster lodging-house that would be designed to 'put up' at least
a thousand souls from the country at one and the same time 'for
one and three per night', and for this small sum each and every
person was to be provided 'with bedstead, good wool mattress,
sheets, blankets and coverlet; with soap, towels and every
accommodation for ablution, a surgeon to attend at nine o'clock
every morning and instantly remove all cases of infectious
disease'; there was to be 'a smoking room, detached from the main
building, where a band of music was to play every evening,
gratis' and 'cold roast and boiled beef and mutton, and ditto
ditto sausages and bacon, and pickles, salads and fruit pies
(when to be procured) were to be furnished at fixed prices', all
the dormitories were to be 'well lighted with gas'; to secure the
complete privacy of the occupants they were 'to be watched over
by efficient wardens and police constables', and finally, 'the
proprietor pledged himself that every care should be taken to
ensure the comfort, convenience and <i>strict discipline</i> of
so large a body.'</p>

<p>What could be fairer than that? Everyone was going. On a
certain morning almost the whole of Uldale and Ireby villages
departed in carts and carriages for the 'Travellers' Train' at
Cockermouth. Others journeyed to Carlisle and met the train for
London there. For hundreds of persons round and about Judith's
little world this was the first real journey of their lives.</p>

<p>And it was, in fact, oddly enough, Dorothy's first train
journey too. She was never one to allow her emotions to get the
better of her, but she did cry a little as she left Timothy,
Veronica, Amabel and Jane to the rotund Miss Meredith. She had
never before been absent from them for a single day, but Miss
Meredith was 'the safest person in the world', nothing could have
appeared more secure that morning than the Uldale lawns and rosy
walls happy under the soft April sun. When, at the station, she
beheld the porters in their green velveteen jackets, heard the
engines fizzling, and the large bells announcing the coming of a
train that soon arrived, bumping and groaning as though in
fearful agony; when, safely in their carriage, they were
entertained by a stout gentleman with the grandest whiskers who
warned them in a voice, husky and urgent, about the perils of
London--the cracksmen, the rampsmen, the snorzers and
thimble-screwers, all these exciting varieties of pickpockets and
murderers--when at last arriving in the Metropolis and waiting
outside the station for their luggage to be brought to them,
there occurred, 'under their very noses, just as though they were
in a theatre', a 'school of acrobats', and an 'equilibrist' spun
plates high in air, balanced burning paper-bags on his chin, and
caught cannon-balls in a cup on the top of his head--why, then
Dorothy forgot her children entirely and surrendered completely
to her adventure.</p>

<p>She had thought that her main occupation in London would be to
take care of Judith, but she very quickly discovered that Judith
took care not only of her but of everyone else in her
company.</p>

<p>During the first evening at the house in Hill Street, Judith
put the second Lady Herries in her proper place in exactly five
minutes. She laughed at her, pinched her chin and exhorted her
thus: 'Now you mustn't mind me, my dear. I'm seventy-seven years
of age and nothing ails me. Wonderful, isn't it? I need no
looking-after. I came to London as a very young girl and was not
at all alarmed by it, so it's most unlikely that I shall be
alarmed by it now. I knew Will long before you were born--that is
the prettiest cashmere, my dear; where <i>did</i> you discover
it?--yes, and Will knows me too, do you not, Will? So you are not
to disturb yourself about me. I shall have <i>everything</i> I
want, I am certain. And now, may I not see little Ellis? I am
dying for a sight of him.'</p>

<p>Dorothy perceived that no one in the large cold house had
anything of Judith's fire and vitality, and that that same fire
burnt only quietly at Uldale. She realized for the first time how
much of her personality Judith subdued in the country, and how
patient Judith had often been with herself and her children.</p>

<p>'Judith is a marvellous woman,' said Will that evening. 'More
marvellous every time I see her.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Dorothy meekly.</p>

<p>That was Will's opinion of Judith; Judith's opinion of Will
was that he was pathetic. Will was eighty-one years of age and
could only go out for an airing, sitting in his carriage, wrapped
up like a mummy and with someone at his side to blow his nose,
see that his feet were warm and that his hat was on straight.
This 'someone' was never Lady Herries, but rather his attendant,
Robins, a thin, severe, black-haired man of very religious
principles. Lady Herries paid no attention to her husband
whatever. She made a sort of a show on the first night of
Judith's visit, gave him his pills and wrapped a shawl around his
shoulders, but after that the virtuous Robins did everything,
cutting his meat for him, pouring him his wine and suddenly
remarking sternly: 'No, Sir William. No potatoes. They are
forbidden.'</p>

<p>However, Will did not seem greatly to care. Judith was
astonished at his subservience. Was this the stern and austere
Will who had commanded so implacably poor weak-jointed
Christabel? 'Shall I be like that soon?' thought Judith. 'I
prefer death.'</p>

<p>But Will did not care, because he had one constant, eager,
unceasing preoccupation--'little Ellis'. Little Ellis was now
eight years of age and as small and wizened a boy as you would be
likely to find. He was accounted exceedingly sharp, had a
moneybox into which he was constantly putting sixpences, and
inquired the price of everything. Will thought him wonderful and
quite frankly now spoke of Walter and Uhland as ungrateful
wretches.</p>

<p>He saw Judith as Walter's principal aggravator and this made
him admire her more than ever. He liked to dilate on the riches
that he was leaving Ellis--Walter was not to have a penny, nor
Uhland, 'that surly peevish cripple', anything either. John and
Elizabeth, however, were to receive a good legacy. Elizabeth he
now loved. He had her to the house whenever he was able, and she,
better than anyone else, seemed to understand and comfort
him.</p>

<p>Of his wife he never spoke, but his allusions to 'poor, good
Christabel' gave Judith to understand that ghosts can, once and
again, have their proper revenge.</p>

<p>Now that it was clear that Will would not live much longer,
visits of members of the Herries family to Hill Street were
frequent. It was not that they were greedy: they cared neither
for money nor poverty. But Will was now the most important member
of their family, and the death of an important Herries was, in
their eyes, a world affair. Carey Rockage, James Herries (a most
tiresome and pompous old bore of seventy-two), Stephen Newmark
(who considered himself a Herries and then something), Amery,
Fred Ormerod (cousin by marriage of Monty Cards and a gay,
drinking bachelor), Bradley Cards (a nephew of Jennifer's), Tim
Trenchard (a busybody cousin of Garth's and Amery's), all these
men with wives, daughters and appendages drove up to Hill Street,
left cards, came and sat in the long, dreary drawing-room and
asked Lady Herries to receptions.</p>

<p>Of them all Judith liked best to see Sylvia. She had loved
Sylvia from the moment of their first meeting and she loved her
still, although the beautiful, bright, impertinent girl she had
first known was now a weary, over-painted, discontented
middle-aged woman. Sylvia had been fighting too long the battle
of living above your means. Had it been her lot to have married a
man of large and assured fortune she would have been a brilliant
and successful leader of Society and, at the last, a contentedly
reminiscent old lady. But Garth was a cheerful, corruptible
vagabond. They had neither of them morals nor honesty. They had
stolen, cheated, lied all their lives long, always without any
desire to hurt or damage, but hurt and damage they had--first
their friends and acquaintances, last of all themselves.
Moreover, the London that now surrounded them was not their own;
the raffish, speculating, bouncing world of the Thirties was
succeeded now by the serious, earnest, virtuous and hypocritical
world of the Fifties. To be fair to Sylvia and Garth, they did
not know how to be hypocritical, nor did they think it good
manners to be earnest. So they were shabby and left-behind and
out at heels.</p>

<p>Sylvia wept on Judith's bosom; the paint ran down her cheeks,
and before she left she accepted ten pounds from Judith with a
readiness that showed that every day of her life she was
accepting small sums from someone.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had one talk with Judith that disturbed her greatly.
Elizabeth was now thirty-six but was as remotely lovely as she
had ever been. That delicate bloom and fragrance belonged to her
still. On the afternoon of this talk she was wearing a costume of
the new 'crystallized' gauze so that she seemed the floating
cloud to which ladies at that time were so fond of comparing
themselves. She was quite unaware of her loveliness: Judith,
watching her with sharp, practised eyes, thought that it was as
though she lived under a glass bell with John, everything and
everybody shut away from them. And she was very unhappy about
him.</p>

<p>'He cannot sleep at night,' she said. 'He thinks that I am not
awake and he talks to himself. He slips out of bed very quietly
and goes into the other room and walks about. I am so frightened,
Aunt Judith.'</p>

<p>Judith kissed her, held her hand, but there was always
something stiffly independent about Elizabeth. She asked for help
but refused to accept it. Also she loved John, Judith thought,
too deeply for it to be healthy.</p>

<p>'Is he worrying about your father?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so--or rather it is Uhland. Uhland obsesses him,
and since he went up to Ireby that day last year it has been
worse.'</p>

<p>'Well, my dear child, I've been fighting your father for years
and am none the worse. John should see this sensibly.'</p>

<p>'But it seems like something in his blood, something inside
himself. As though he were pursued by Uhland. It is a fantasy,
Aunt Judith--not real at all. After all, what can Uhland do?'</p>

<p>'His father had the same, and his great-grandfather; something
that would never let them alone. Well,' Judith sighed
impatiently, 'I cannot understand it. I never could. When there's
a difficulty or a danger, face it. Don't run away from it.'</p>

<p>'John does face it,' Elizabeth answered indignantly. 'You must
not think he is a coward, Aunt Judith. He's tremendously brave in
everything--but this is like a sickness.'</p>

<p>Judith nodded her head; there were two worlds, she knew, and
unless you found the connexion between them you never found
peace. Once she had herself had to make a choice. She had made it
and was now the old woman she was in consequence.</p>

<p>Then she found that it was a very fine thing to give cheap
advice to others, but that she had her own trouble to face. Her
trouble--one that she had never expected nor considered--was that
she was plunged, willy-nilly, into a sea of jealousy about Adam.
Willy-nilly because, cry out as she might, refuse to be, at her
age, so mean and small and petty, there she was in it up to the
neck.</p>

<p>Adam had of course been the great central fact of her visit to
London. To see the Great Exhibition certainly, but to see it with
Adam. To lean on Adam's strong arm everywhere, to have the
delicious intimate little talks with him, simply the two of them
alone in her room, that had been for many years now her greatest
happiness in life, to feel, above all, that no one had the close
relationship with him that she herself had. It was not that she
wished to shut Margaret out. She was neither so selfish nor so
stupid. Moreover, she had fought that battle before and had won a
victory. But her later life had been built up on the absolute
intimacy of herself and her son, an intimacy that no one and
nothing could break. She was, however, becoming greedy, greedy of
her vitality, her uniqueness. She was 'Madame', the most
marvellous old lady in Cumberland and, if she wished, the most
marvellous old lady in London. This was nothing in her as cheap
and petty as conceit, but the sort of amused triumph we all feel
when we are clever at a game. All this was on the surface, but
her very soul was possessed by her love for Adam. No one knew how
deep that went. She had only loved two people in all her life,
her husband and her son, but she loved them like a tigress. At
the same time she had human enough wisdom and tolerance enough to
keep the tigress behind bars.</p>

<p>Never before had her relationship with Adam been threatened as
it was now. She perceived at once that the reason of it was the
sudden and violent death of Margaret's father. She had not known
of the scene between Margaret and Adam that Christmastime at
Uldale. That would have informed her yet further had she been
aware of it. But since Caesar Kraft's death she had seen very
little of Adam and Margaret. They had paid only one brief visit
to Uldale. She was quite unprepared for this change.</p>

<p>It was not that Adam was not as devoted as ever. He was there
at Hill Street to meet her on the first evening. When they were
alone in her room, he took her in his arms and hugged and kissed
her as though he would never let her go.</p>

<p>'Why, how strong you are, Adam!' she cried, laughing and
crying and happy as a queen. It was after this that she perceived
that his thoughts were always on Margaret. <i>He</i> was of
course as silent as ever, but her first sight of Margaret told
her that there was here a new assurance and certainty. Margaret
possessed Adam now and was quietly radiant because of it. They
had three rooms in Pimlico. Adam wrote for the papers, knew
Dickens and John Forster, Yates and Wilkie Collins. He was not of
the writing world, stayed quietly outside it, made few friends,
but made those few firmly. He wrote considerably about politics,
reviewed books a little, and said cheerfully to his mother that
the only things he really wanted to write were fairy stories.</p>

<p>'Fairy stories!' Judith cried, looking at Adam's stocky,
thickset frame and ugly unromantic countenance.</p>

<p>'Don't be afraid, Mother,' he said, laughing. 'I shall never
write them. I must earn our bread and butter, but a good fairy
story--there must be a handsome satisfaction in writing a good
fairy story.'</p>

<p>This was nonsense of course, so she told him sharply, but it
annoyed her that Margaret should think it quite a natural thing
for him to do. 'Yes,' Margaret explained, 'he has found real life
so very absurd.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' Judith answered. 'I never listened to such stuff.
Fairy stories! A man like Adam! Why, he has a chest like a
bull's!'</p>

<p>She soon discovered that her relations with her son and
daughter-in-law were complicated by her advancing years. She was
a wonderful old lady, but she could not do as she used to do. She
took her breakfast in bed every morning and did not rise until
midday. She was forced to confess that she returned to Hill
Street exceedingly weary after her shopping expeditions. It was
necessary, therefore, for Adam and Margaret to come to her rather
than that she should go to them, and she thought that Margaret
accompanied her husband too frequently.</p>

<p>Being direct and honest, she immediately said so.</p>

<p>'My dear boy, I am in London for a very brief visit. I have
one foot in the grave. I love Margaret, of course, but I love you
more.'</p>

<p>He said nothing (he never did say anything), but he came
alone. Then she fancied that he was thinking of Margaret and
wishing that he were with her.</p>

<p>She would interrupt some Cumberland piece of gossip with a
sharp: 'Now, Adam, you are not attending. You are thinking of
Margaret.'</p>

<p>Jealousy began to mount in her as the tide swells a sea-pool.
She slept now but badly, and before had not minded that, for she
would lie and think of the old days, of Georges and Reuben and
Charlie Watson and Warren, Adam's father, until the room seemed
crowded with their figures; but now she could think of nothing
but Adam, and, with the fantastic exaggeration that the night
hours give, she would beat her thin little hands together and cry
to herself that she had lost him for ever, that she was a
miserable, deserted old woman, and that she might as well die. It
was then that her poignant despair at the choice that so many
years ago she had made for the sake of Jennifer, John and
Dorothy, would strike her like a voice of doom.</p>

<p>'Ah! if I had but gone with Adam to Watendlath he would have
been mine for ever!'</p>

<p>But in the daylight she was by far too sensible and blessed
with too strong a sense of humour to tolerate such obvious
melodrama. She laughed at herself, her fears, her selfishness.
Nevertheless her jealousy mounted. She was as sweet as Tennyson's
Miller's Daughter to Margaret, but Margaret was not deceived. The
trouble with both Margaret and Adam was that they were so quiet.
You could not tell what they were truly thinking!</p>

<p>Poor Judith! Jealousy is from the Devil. It was hard for her
that she should have to fight her first real battle with him at
so advanced an age!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Great Day approached. The Great Day arrived!</p>

<p>But the whole of London was by this time an Exhibition.
Foreigners were everywhere--Germans, Turks, Americans, French and
even Chinamen. On every side amusements were springing up, M.
Alexis Soyer opened his Restaurant of All the Nations, there was
'the Black Band of His Majesty of Tsjaddi with a hundred
additional bones', the Musicians of Tongoose, the Troubadours of
Far Vancouver, the Theban Brothers, and the most celebrated Band
of Robbers from the Desert. Barnum provided a splendid
entertainment, whereby for a rather costly ticket a guest was
provided with 'a bed, a boudoir and a banquet, together with one
hour's use per diem of a valet and a private chaplain, free
admission to theatrical green-rooms, a seat in the House of
Commons, and a cigar on the Bench of Judges'. Mr Catlin reopened
his Indian Exhibition, and Mr Wyld would take you on the 'Grand
Tour of Europe', or a visit to Australia or New Zealand for
threepence a time.</p>

<p>But it was enough for Judith and Dorothy simply to view the
crowds in the streets. The road to the Crystal Palace was an
amazing scene. Trains of wagons lengthened far away, like an
Eastern caravan, each waiting for its turn to be unloaded.
Omnibuses, carriages, carts, barrows congested the road. The
public houses, of which there were a great number, hung out gay
and patriotic flags, and their doors were crowded with loafers,
soldiers, beggars and women with shawls over their heads. Along
the pavement were lined the hawkers shouting their wares, trays
filled with bright silvery-seeming medals of the Exhibition,
pictures of it printed in gold on 'gelatine cards', many barrows
with ginger-beer, oranges and nuts.</p>

<p>Along Rotten Row troops of riders galloped noiselessly over
the loose soft ground at the rear of the Crystal Palace, while in
front of it an interminable line of carriages crawled slowly
past. Close to the rails were mobs of spectators on tip-toe,
their necks outstretched, seeking glimpses of progress. All along
the building were ladders with painters perched high upon them
and walking on the crystal covering which miraculously sustained
them. At the end of the building were steam-engines puffing
clouds of steam, and amid the wreckage of thousands of
packing-cases were giant blocks of granite, huge lumps of coal,
great anchors, the ruins of a prehistoric world. The noise,
confusion, turmoil--who, asked Dorothy, could describe them? She
was given to platitudes, and irritated Judith by insisting that
'such chaos is an emblem of man's energy working to a just end'.
The Exhibition in fact turned her head a little spiritually, and
made her so deeply proud of being a Herries that she seemed to
walk like a goddess. All the Herries felt the same, that the
Exhibition was their especial work and Queen Victoria the head of
the family.</p>

<p>On the Great Day itself, the First of May, the heart of London
beat with a pride and exaltation that was to affect the country
for at least another fifty years.</p>

<p>Judith, Dorothy, Lady Herries, little Ellis, Adam, Margaret,
John and Elizabeth had, all of them, thanks to old Will's power
and position, splendid seats for the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>They started early, and that was wise, for the carriage was
soon involved in a long, wearisome procession of carriages from
whose windows every kind of bonnet and hat was poking and shrill
feminine voices exclaiming: 'But this is monstrous! We shall miss
the Queen! It is really too bad!'</p>

<p>John and Elizabeth were to join the others inside the building
and were already there when Lady Herries, dressed in a
magnificent purple bonnet and superb cashmere shawl, her head
very much up, led in her little procession. Judith came last,
leaning on Adam's arm.</p>

<p>They had excellent places, and the Sight, the Vision, the
Glory--this, as Dorothy remarked, 'exceeded all Expectations and
showed what Man could do when guided by the Divine Will'.
(Dorothy was not, in her normal Cumberland domesticity, in the
least like this. 'You are a little over-excited, my dear,' Judith
had told her that morning.)</p>

<p>Yes, it was superb! Their seats were in one of the galleries,
the galleries planted like flower-gardens with bonnets of pink,
yellow and white. The Great Central Glory was the Glass Fountain.
Of this Archdeacon Rodney Herries' son, Captain William Herries,
RN, wrote in his <i>A Jolly Tar's Capers</i> (Weston and Mary,
1895): 'This glorious fountain in the centre of the building,
shining, as the sun's rays came slanting down upon it through the
crystal roof, as if it had been carved out of icicles, or as if
the water streaming from the fountain had been made suddenly
solid and transfixed into beautiful forms. Although but a rough,
careless little Middy at the time, I can remember well that,
standing beside my father, at that time Archdeacon of Polchester
in Glebeshire, tears welled up into my youthful eyes and pride of
my country fired my ambition.</p>

<p>'"It is such families as ours in such a country as ours," I
remember my dear father remarking, "that, under God's Grace, can
create, for the benefit of the world, such wonders."'</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Judith saw it all less romantically.
Rodney Herries she had, incidentally, always detested. But
nevertheless she was carried away, forgetting years, jealousies,
aches and pains (for this morning she had a little rheumatism).
For one thing the noise was terrific. The waiting multitude was
quiet enough, but around them, throughout the building, all the
machinery had been set in motion--the MACHINERY, key-note of the
Exhibition, symbol, relentless, humourless, of the new world that
this day, May 1st, 1851, was introducing. There were in the
machine-room the 'self-acting mules', the Jacquard lace machines,
the envelope machines, the power looms, the model locomotives,
centrifugal pumps, the vertical steam-engines, all of these
working like mad, while the thousands near by, in their high hats
and bonnets, sat patiently waiting, passive, unwitting that the
Age of Man on this Planet was doomed.</p>

<p>Judith and Adam, John and Elizabeth, were most certainly
unwitting. Judith's little hand was thrust through Adam's thick
arm, while John and Elizabeth were holding hands under
Elizabeth's shawl. Margaret was thinking of her father and
wishing that he were here, Dorothy's mouth was wide open, and
Lady Herries was studying a coarse-grained Chamb&eacute;ry gauze
near to her and wondering whether she could obtain one like it.
Yes, a superb scene! The canopy above the royal seat, adorned
with golden cornice and fringe and a small plume of blue and
white feathers at each angle, the floors clean and matted, at
each corner of the central square stages for illustrious
visitors, from the gallery tops magnificent carpets and
tapestries hanging, here the Spitalfields Trophy with its
gorgeous silks, and there, the supreme triumph for many, the
wonderful plaster of Paris statues, so white, so gleaming, their
nudity draped so decently with red cloth. A sob rose in many
throats, too, at the sight of the splendid equestrian statues of
the Prince and the Queen, so large and lifelike that you might
imagine that at any moment the horses might start to charge down
the central aisle. (This was Dorothy's fine whispered thought.)
Here, to quote Captain William once again: 'Behind these was
another Fountain' (it appears that he nourished a passion for
fountains!) 'that made the stream as it rushed up from the centre
and divided itself into a hundred drops, flashing in the sun as
they fell, look like a shower of silver sparks--a kind of
firework of water; and beside this rose the green plumage of the
palm trees embedded in moss, while close at their feet was ranged
a bed of flowers, whose tints seemed to have been dyed by the
prismatic hues of the water-drops of the neighbouring fountain.
Then appeared the old elm trees of the park, looking almost like
the lions of the forest caught in a net of glass; and behind them
again was a screen of iron tracery, so light and delicate that it
seemed like a lace-work of bronze.'</p>

<p>A little later he continues: 'But it was when the retinue of
the Court began to assemble that the scene became one--perhaps
the most--gorgeous in colouring and ever beheld; for it was seen
in the clear light of the transparent roof above. The
gold-embroidered bosoms of the officers seemed to be almost
alight with the glitter of their ornaments; there stood all the
ministers of state in their glittering suits; the ambassadors of
every country, some in light blues and silver, others in green
and gold, others in white, with their bosoms' (incidentally a
favourite word of the Captain's) 'studded with their
many-coloured orders. There was the Chinese mandarin in his red
cap, with peacock's feathers dangling behind, and his silken
robes with quaint devices painted upon them in front and at the
back. There was the turbaned Turk, and the red fez-capped
Egyptian; and there were the chocolate-coloured Court suits, with
their filigree steel buttons, and long, white embroidered silk
waistcoats.</p>

<p>There was the old DUKE too' (these are the Captain's capital
letters) 'with his silver hair and crooked back showing most
conspicuous amongst the whole. At the back and sides of the
throne stood the gentlemen-at-arms, in their golden helmets, with
the long plumes of white ribbon-like feathers drooping over them.
Beside these were the portly-looking beefeaters, in their red
suits and black velvet caps; and near them were the trumpeters,
in their golden coats and close-fitting jockey-caps, with silver
trumpets in their hands. Near these were the Aldermen, in their
red gowns of office, and the Common-Councilmen in their blue silk
gowns, and the Recorder in long powdered Judge's wig, the
Archbishop in full lawn sleeves and close curly wig, the Musical
Director in his white satin-damask robe and quaint-looking black
cap, the heralds in their emblazoned robes, the Garter
King-at-Arms in his gorgeous red velvet coat becrusted all over
in gold--while round all these were ranged sappers and miners, in
their red and yellow uniforms; and behind them were seen the
dark-blue coats of the police.'</p>

<p>And the brave Captain complacently comments:</p>

<p>'It was a feast of colour and splendour to sit and gloat
over--a congress of all the nations for the most hallowed and
blessed of objects--one, perhaps, that made the two old soldiers,
as they tottered backwards and forwards across the scene, the
most noticeable, because in such a gathering for such an object,
the mind could hardly help looking upon them as the last of the
warriors to whom the nation would owe its future greatness. I
could not but reflect,' the Captain adds, 'that my own family
that has been proud to call England its mother for so many
centuries had, under God's divine direction, helped sensibly by
its honest devotion to duty and its consistent patriotism to
bring this Great Country into its supreme world-dominating
position.'</p>

<p>Then he continues after this little spurt of family pride: 'At
a few minutes before the appointed hour the royal carriages with
their bright liveries were seen to flash past the windows of the
northern entrance; then darted by a troop of the Life Guards,
with their steel helmets and breastplates glistening in the
sunshine, and immediately after, the glass sides and roof of the
Crystal Palace twanged with the flourish of trumpets that
announced the arrival of the Queen. At this moment the gates were
flung back, and within the crimson vestibule appeared a blaze of
gold and bright colours.</p>

<p>'Then advanced the royal retinue, with the ushers and
chamberlain in front, bowing as they moved backwards towards the
throne; and after them the Prince leading the Princess Royal, and
the Queen with the Prince of Wales, and followed by their
Court.</p>

<p>'As the Queen moved onwards with her diamond tiara and little
crown of brilliants scintillating in the light, the whole
assembly rose and, waving their hats and fluttering their
handkerchiefs, they shouted forth peal after peal of
welcome.'</p>

<p>And here we may leave the excellent Captain in his happy state
of obsequious reminiscence. His book is unquestionably of value,
quite apart from its Herries interest, and is certainly worthy of
a modern reprint. It attained six editions in the 'nineties.</p>

<p>Sad to say, Judith was not at all moved as was Rodney's son.
For one thing the seat on which she was sitting was exceedingly
hard, for another she was bothered by the noise of the machines,
for another she was feeling odd in the head, a little as though
she had been drinking. And for another she had never, in all her
life, been impressed very greatly by domesticity: the Queen, the
Prince, and their two children appeared to her so dreadfully
domestic. That was on her father's side. On her proper Herries
side she would have been undoubtedly more deeply impressed had
she been quite at her ease. But she was distressed about John,
about Adam, and a very little about herself. Most certainly she
felt queer, as though there were a weight pressing on her heart,
as though, unless she were careful, she would see double. She
thought that, in all probability, this glittering and
scintillating glass disturbed her. Absurd to build so large a
place entirely of glass!</p>

<p>She could not resist, however, some beating of the heart when,
as the Queen moved forward, wearing her diamond tiara and crown
of brilliants, everyone rose and, waving hats, fluttering
handkerchiefs, shouted their cries of welcome. Judith rose,
fluttered her handkerchief, shouted with the rest. For a moment
she was deeply stirred. The sturdy figure of Victoria appeared to
divorce itself from all the world around it, as though it said:
'I am lonely. I am a Queen. I represent loneliness, austerity and
power.'</p>

<p>She had that quality, was to have it all her life, of sudden
dignified remoteness, so that she became a symbol, a promise, a
prophecy. Judith, old enough to be that same Queen's grandmother,
felt that now. The white head and light-blue coat of the Master
of the Queen's Music appeared on the rostrum, he raised his
baton, and above what Captain Herries called 'the melodious
thunder of the organ', the National Anthem--led by the
choristers--filled the glass dome and was caught by the light and
glitter and flung into the sunny heavens. The Archbishop asked
for a blessing (the Machinery frantically responded), the Queen
and Prince walked in procession, and then Her Majesty declared
the Exhibition open. And to end once again with Captain William:
'Immediately were heard the booming of the hundred guns without,
telling the people of the Metropolis that the Great Exhibition of
the Industry of All Nations had been formally inaugurated.'</p>

<p>Judith recovered herself and sat down. That reaction that
inevitably follows all climaxes seized her. What, after all, was
all this fuss about? It would only make the country and everyone
in it exceedingly conceited. And how tiresome the Exhibition had
already become! For months in advance of it no one had talked of
anything else, and now for months after it no one would have any
other topic. She looked down from the gallery, and the mere
thought of all the plaster statues, the great organ, the
fountain, the machinery, the furniture, the stalls covered with
goods, the endless cups of tea, the ferns and plants and
blossoming shrubs, the crying children, angry husbands and
disappointed wives, all this wearied her beyond measure.</p>

<p>'I think that I will return to Hill Street,' she said to
Adam.</p>

<p>'Very well, Mother dear, but first you must see just a few of
the sights.'</p>

<p>She did not want to see any of the sights. She would like to
be seated safely and privately in her armchair in her room at
Hill Street.</p>

<p>Says Captain William Herries: 'Well might the nation be proud
of its Crystal Palace. No other people in the world could have
raised such a building . . .'</p>

<p>That is exactly what Judith thought, straining up her old eyes
to the glitter and the shine. 'All this glass,' she thought, 'so
ostentatious', and her dislike of Prince Albert, assuaged for a
moment by the National Anthem, returned in full force.</p>

<p>Adam took her by the arm and she walked gaily along, with
Dorothy and Lady Herries very patriotic behind her, Margaret on
her other side, and John and Elizabeth not exchanging a word.</p>

<p>'Why don't they speak?' she thought. 'Aren't they happy?' She
was wearing a soft grey bonnet and a mantilla of shaded
grenadine. She walked as though she were twenty, with every once
and again a step that was rebellious, originating in some quite
other person. She still saw double on occasion, and there was a
twinge of pain in her right shoulder.</p>

<p>There were of course a great many things to see, and oh dear!
So many people! Bonnets and polkas, polkas and bonnets, green and
brown 'wide-awakes' and fluffy beaver hats--and then the People,
this time with a capital P! They will be <i>much</i> worse on the
shilling days, but there seem to be a great many of them, even as
it is, many with babies in their arms, many with baskets, many
with fat bursting cotton umbrellas.</p>

<p>'There are too many people,' Judith said to Adam. The pain in
her shoulder had spread to her armpit. 'Really,' she thought,
'Lady Herries is an <i>idiot</i>!'</p>

<p>Oh dear, there are a <i>great</i> many things to see! Here is
a railwayman, family following, his japan pouch by his side,
hurrying to see the locomotives; there a carpenter in a yellow
fluffy flannel jacket pointing out to two small boys the beauties
of a huge top formed of one section of a mahogany tree.</p>

<p>'Ridiculous!' Judith thought. 'No one in the world can wish
for a top as big as that!'</p>

<p>Here is a hatless and yellow-stockinged Bluecoat boy mounting
the steps of one of the huge prismatic lighthouses to see the way
that it is made . . . Look! There is a model of the Italian Opera
House, and behold! There is a minute and most extensive model of
Liverpool with a looking-glass sea and thousands of cardboard
vessels. This last Adam examined with the most serious care.
'Remarkable! Very remarkable indeed!' he repeated again and
again.</p>

<p>Judith could not explain it, she was greatly ashamed but she
wanted to slap him. As with all mothers in the world there were
moments when she wondered whether these very prosaic results were
at all worth all the pains that she had taken.</p>

<p>'Did I bring him up for this?' she thought as she watched him
so seriously count the cardboard ships. Then she caught
Margaret's calm look of devotion and she hated Margaret. There
was no doubt but that she was not at all well.</p>

<p>Of course they must see the machinery. For hours Judith had
been dreading this moment. Pressed close against the stout limbs
of a member of the National Guard--'Really a <i>childish</i>
costume,' she thought as she looked upwards to his conical hat
with its little ball on top, and smelt the rough texture of his
red worsted epaulettes and full-painted trousers--she was
compelled to admire the power-looms, and then there was the steam
brewery, then the model carriages moving along the new pneumatic
railway, the hemispherical lamp-shades made out of a flat sheet
of paper, the exceedingly noisy flax-crushing machine, the
splashing centrifugal pump, the whirling of the cylindrical
steam-press . . .</p>

<p>'Adam,' she whispered, drawing him a little closer to her, 'I
am glad that I am an old woman. All these machines--what a very
unpleasant world it is going to be!'</p>

<p>She whispered, because Dorothy and Lady Herries were in a
state of fluttering ecstasy. 'Stupendous!' 'What an achievement!'
'Do observe those wonderful little wheels!' 'Man's triumph over
Nature!' Dorothy was proving herself a true Herries. She saw
Herries everywhere. If it had not been for the Herries family . .
. Strange! Judith must certainly be unwell, for she wanted to
slap both Dorothy and Lady Herries.</p>

<p>'Adam,' she whispered, 'I fear that I <i>must</i> sit
down!'</p>

<p>There was no reply and, looking up, she saw that Adam was not
there. Looking farther she discovered Adam and Margaret, a
distance away, their backs turned to her, close together
examining a piece of machinery. That was possibly the worst
moment of her life. Absurd--so little a thing! And yet the horror
of Georges' death, the tragedy of Francis' suicide, the awful
evening of Adam's birth--none had touched the loneliness, the
isolation of this neglect. Lady Herries was examining a miniature
engine with a great assumption of technical knowledge, Elizabeth
and John had disappeared.</p>

<p>Judith proudly, her bonnet up, walked away. As she reached the
outer hall pain seized her, her heart was beating strangely. Her
limbs trembled. Everyone around her seemed weary. On the steps of
the red-cloth-covered pedestals weary women and children were
seated, some of them munching thick slices of bread and meat.
Around the fountains were gathered exhausted families drinking
out of thick mugs. All over the floor were orange-skins, dirty
pieces of paper; Judith sat down on one of the crimson steps,
resting her head on her hands. Was she going to die in this
ridiculous place with all these strangers around her? The noise
of the machines rattled and quivered, piercing her very backbone.
'Am I going to die? Is this the end?'</p>

<p>A stout woman near to her, her legs spread, crooking a baby in
one arm, was drinking out of a bottle. Strange, Judith thought,
to allow such people in on the day of the Queen's first visit.
But that was right. All were equal--all women together. She had
read somewhere that after a certain hour the general public would
be admitted. The sight of the woman strengthened and comforted
her. She was herself a vagabond, born of vagabonds. No Herries,
but daughter of a gipsy. Even though her son deserted her, even
though all the pains in the world attacked her, even though this
horrible machinery invaded the world, destroying peace and
privacy, no one could touch her, she was independent.</p>

<p>She looked up, and there was John. He was standing quite near
to her but did not see her. On his face was a look of pitiable
distress. He held himself taut, his hands to his side, as if he
were answering some charge. On every side of him the crowd pushed
and thrust, but he was as alone as though no one else were in the
world.</p>

<p>The sight of someone in trouble always caused her to forget
herself. She rose, although her knees trembled, walked over to
him and touched his arm. He started; her touch had drawn him from
a dream.</p>

<p>'John, dear. Take me home. I am very tired.'</p>

<p>That charming kindly smile that she loved in him so much
warmed her heart.</p>

<p>'Why, of course, Aunt Judith. We will find Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>She had her hand lightly on his arm. No one should know how
ill she felt.</p>

<p>'Such a noise! So many people! I am realizing, my dear John,
what a very old woman I am.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, Aunt Judith,' he said, patting her hand. 'This
would be too much for anyone.'</p>

<p>But as he looked at her with so kindly an expression, she
realized that it was true: she was an old woman at last.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c305">THE FUNERAL</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The last visit to London that she was ever to pay was early in
1854, and the occasion was Will's funeral.</p>

<p>They all said that it was defying Providence for her to go,
for she was seventy-nine that Christmas, but she was determined:
nothing and no one should stop her. In honest fact they all knew
a fearful pride in her resolve. Seventy-nine and going to London!
No one but a Herries could have done it, but the Herries always
lived to a great age and died in their boots! Look at Will!
Eighty-four and in the City three days before his death. It was
true that he had been strapped up in his carriage like a mummy,
and had held a sort of reception there in Threadneedle Street
with clerks and people bowing to him on the steps of his offices:
nevertheless, eighty-four and working in the City!</p>

<p>Judith was perfectly conscious of all the things that the
different Herries, scattered about the country, would be thinking
of her enterprise and, being half Herries herself, she was
pleased that they should be pleased. Then of course she insisted
that she must pay tribute to Will, for Will was part of her whole
life, and now, when her youth was for ever present with her,
intermingling with all the current events of her day so that it
was often impossible to tell which was past and which was
present, Will was perhaps nearer to her than he had ever been
before. For as a girl she had never liked him; as a woman she had
often despised him; but now, joined as they were in their old age
together, she almost loved him.</p>

<p>She had, however, two principal motives for her departure. One
was that she would see her beloved Adam, a motive sufficient to
carry her <i>and</i> her coffin if necessary to the North Pole;
and the other (although this she confessed to no one in the
world) her desire to show Walter Herries that she was still alive
and kicking.</p>

<p>Now, when she could not move about as she had once done, but
must sit, either in the garden when it was sunny and warm, or in
the parlour before the fire, or in her bed with her lace cap on
her head and mittens on her fingers just like any other old lady
(although she was not in the least like any other old lady!)
events and persons were inclined, if you did not keep them in
order, to acquire a gigantic significance.</p>

<p>On the one hand she was tranquil as she had never been in her
life before. Old age certainly did that for you; and on the days
when there was no pain to bother her (for pains of one sort and
another paid her now quite constant visits), when she was neither
wildly excited by some pleasure (like an unexpected dish for
dinner or a sudden visit of a friend, or something entrancing
that little Jane had been doing, or a piece of gossip) nor
exasperated by some bit of foolishness or some alarm about Adam,
why, then this tranquillity was marvellous! You just sat there,
or lay there, and it lapped you round like a radiant sheet of
golden light, light within you, above you, around you, while the
trees burnt in gold steadily against the sky and the streams ran
murmuring to your feet, and all this lovely world stood still for
you. It was at such times (and they were many) that the past
became the present and the present the future. Then there was no
Time. She was a child again, watching them ride the horse up Tom
Gauntry's staircase, and she was eating roast goose at the
'Elephant', she was walking beside dear Charlie Watson at
Watendlath--all was alive again, nothing had died, she herself
was immortal.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the things that disturbed, disturbed violently,
and the thing that disturbed the worst was Walter. No climax had
come as yet to their quarrel. That moment when she had turned to
Jennifer and said (ah, how many years ago! Poor Jennifer!): 'Do
not be distressed, my dear. I am going to remain,' that challenge
had as yet reached no climax. But the climax would come. She knew
it as though she were a prophetess and could see the future.
Already enough unhappiness had been generated by that old, old
quarrel. John's life, Elizabeth's life, Jennifer's life, Walter's
Life, Uhland's life--all these had been damaged by it, as hatred
and jealousy and envy always damaged any lives that they touched.
Her own life and Adam's had been changed by it, for she would
have been in Watendlath long ago but for it, and still there was
worse to come. She had stayed in Uldale and protected them all,
but Walter was still there, the Fortress was still there, Peach's
cottage (there was now a younger Peach in command) was just over
her garden wall; Walter was a sot and Uhland a crazy
misanthrope--but they were not gone, they still remained.</p>

<p>She had been told, only a week or two ago, that Walter had
said of her: 'That old bed-ridden gipsy.' Bed-ridden, was she?
She would show him! She would go to London if for no other
reason!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was Will that she was thinking of as she made
her departure. Her heart was soft with tenderness.</p>

<p>Dorothy came with her and was full of matronly care and fuss.
After the day of her visit to the Great Exhibition, Judith, to
everyone's surprise and offering no reason, abandoned her gay
colours and adopted a kind of uniform, black with white ruffles
and white lace at the throat. With her hair that had the shining
softness of snow and the deep white upon white of an evening
cloud, with her small pale face, her exquisite neatness and
cleanliness, carrying in her hand her cane, she had the air of
some austere Mistress of Ceremonies. But then her whole body and
nature laughed at austerity. As she grew older her sense of fun,
enjoyment of little things and active consciousness of that
enjoyment, her eagerness for news, her avidity for sharing in
everything, these things constantly increased in her. Her
heart--she was warned that she must be careful of her heart. 'My
heart?' she laughed. 'It's as sound as one of Dorothy's muffins'
(for Dorothy was a good housekeeper but a heavy-handed cook).
Then there was the rheumatism, and sometimes she felt faint. Once
indeed she fainted in her bedroom, but no one was there with her
and no one was told of it. On many days she was as well and
strong as Veronica and Amabel--both very healthy girls. One
afternoon she slapped Veronica very heartily indeed because that
child, aged now sixteen, told her that God disapproved of reading
common books on a Sunday.</p>

<p>'You are a prig, the most dreadful animal in Creation,' Judith
cried, and when Veronica, losing her temper, shouted, 'And you're
a gipsy,' Judith slapped her. Veronica, who was not a bad child,
was appalled at what she had done, and Judith walked all the way
upstairs and brought her down a bag of peppermints. (Judith liked
peppermints and always kept a store in her bedroom.) All this in
one afternoon.</p>

<p>Moreover, with her favourite Jane, now a wisp of a child of
thirteen, she would play games by the hour and never tire. They
would play backgammon and Pope Joan, and then Jane would read to
her--Macaulay's <i>History,</i> Ruskin's <i>Seven Lamps of
Architecture, Pendennis, Hypatia.</i> Judith thought Ruskin 'a
bit of a prig' but didn't say so, because Jane thought him so
beautiful. After Adam, Judith loved most in the world this
dreaming romantic child who was of the tribe of Francis and
Reuben and John. 'I am afraid she will be unhappy,' Judith
thought, 'but she will have some of the joys none of the others
will know.'</p>

<p>When she set off with Dorothy for London it was Jane who came
into her room alone, Jane she held to her heart with all that
impetuous feeling that years could not dim, Jane who gave her a
parcel of three little handkerchiefs that she had worked, Jane
who stood in the road staring long after the carriage had
disappeared. Timothy, now a big stout fellow of seventeen, who
bore a strange resemblance to the portraits of his
great-grandfather David Herries, teased her:</p>

<p>'She's a nice old lady, but whew! what a temper!' he
remarked.</p>

<p>Jane gave him a queer look.</p>

<p>'All right,' he said uneasily, pinching her ear. 'I daresay I
like her as much as you do, if all the truth were known.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>She was so weary when she, at last, reached Hill Street that
she felt as though her whole body had been crushed under the
wheels of the train that had conveyed her.</p>

<p>She saw Lady Herries for a moment, and her tenderness for poor
Will enveloped the stout painted lady, whom she had never liked,
who, however, looked better in her full black silk than she had
ever looked in gay colours. She was sitting in the vast dismal
drawing room and wearing a bonnet of velvet and cr&ecirc;pe.
Everyone was wearing velvet just then.</p>

<p>'That's one thing,' said Judith to Dorothy as she began to
undress. 'I shall never wear velvet, my dear. Never! I shall die
first!' She added: 'I am dead now, I think. The smell of gas in
that train was quite awful. Give me Mr Thorpe's <i>Northern
Mythology.</i> It's at the top of my bag. It will send me to
sleep if anything will.'</p>

<p>The maid who brought her her breakfast in the morning was full
of information. There was nothing that Judith liked better than
to have someone with whom she might chat while she was having her
breakfast.</p>

<p>It seemed that Will had died quite suddenly of heart failure
at three o'clock in the morning. He had not felt well and had
gone to his wife's room and had fallen down there dead.</p>

<p>The maid did not know, Judith did not know, no one would ever
know of the awful little conversation that had taken place on
that last morning.</p>

<p>It was true: he had felt very unwell and had stumbled to Lady
Herries' room. He walked with great difficulty, but she had woken
to see him standing there, swaying on his feet, a candle in his
hand.</p>

<p>'I think I am going to die,' he gasped, his hand at his heart.
She had jumped out of bed, found the drops that were to be given
to him if there were a heart-attack. He had sunk, blue in the
face, into a chair. He recovered a little, looked up into her
face, and saw in those pale-blue eyes a look of eagerness.</p>

<p>'You are glad that I am dying,' he said.</p>

<p>'Will! Will!' she cried, sinking on to her knees beside the
chair. 'How can you be so cruel?'</p>

<p>'It is very natural,' he replied. 'I don't blame you. It is
perfectly right. You never even pretended to love me. No one has
ever loved me. Not even Ellis--'</p>

<p>She protested and tried to hold his hand. He waved her away
with a gesture of great dignity. Then his face became purple.</p>

<p>'I have wanted the wrong things--' he murmured, and died.</p>

<p>The funeral was to be at twelve. A great many members of the
family were expected. Soon Adam came in to see her. She held out
her arms and he knelt by the bed, took her small white hand in
his and laughed for sheer joy at being with her again. For, when
you had said everything, there was something between these two,
stronger than life, stronger than death, something that no one
shared with them, something that if it could be caught and held,
hard and shining in one's hand like a flaming crystal, would
explain, quite sufficiently, what everything is about and why we
are travelling at all. But of course it can't be caught.</p>

<p>'Isn't this room absurd?' Judith said, laughing. She could
never grow accustomed to the fashions of the time. She belonged
in taste to the end of the eighteenth century. Looking back,
everything of that time seemed to her to have lightness,
brilliance and form. Everything in 1854 was huge, heavy and
static, wrapped, too, in a sort of damp fog.</p>

<p>In her room there was a sofa covered with red rep, a copper
scuttle and scoop (quite gigantic), a huge fender of brass,
fire-irons of set steel, a hearthrug of white sheepskin, two
great Minton vases with a floral design on a turquoise ground, a
picture made out of seaweed in a frame of Tunbridge ware, a
work-box--also of Tunbridge ware--that had a lid with a bouquet
in mosaic and sides with 'Berlin wool' mosaic, and a vast
dressing-table and mirror, trimmed with glazed linen and muslin.
All these things and many more jostled one another in the room
that was chill with the chill of the grave. In their centre, very
bare, very innocent, was a tin bath.</p>

<p>Among these things Adam knelt and held her hand. He was a
broad square man now, brown of face. She didn't like his
whiskers, although, of course, every man wore them. She loved his
eyes, which were bright, shining and most kindly. He had great
breadth of shoulders, looked as strong as an ox. He was
absentminded, but not with her. He wrote for one of Dickens'
papers, reviewed books. He was happily married. He was
thirty-eight years of age. All these things were apparently true.
But the only thing that was true for her was that he was a small
child running up the path from the Tarn at Watendlath, calling
out to her that he had seen a kingfisher.</p>

<p>These glorious moments came to her very seldom, but, after
that awful hour at the Exhibition, she had beaten down her
jealousy. Killed it? No, perhaps not, but she was nearly eighty
years of age and must learn to accept facts. Was there anything
else to learn of life?</p>

<p>She stroked his brown cheek, kissed him, chattered, laughed,
then sent him away. She must get up and face the family.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a moment that they none of them afterwards forgot, her
entrance into the big drawing-room where they were all gathered
together. The blinds were drawn and the room was lit with gas
which giggled like a silly schoolgirl. The gas was, however, the
only jester. Everyone was immensely solemn. Lady Herries sat on
the sofa, Ellis at her side. All around her were grouped the
family. James Herries was the oldest--he was seventy-five. He
stood beside the sofa, a vast, swollen, pompous effigy in black.
There was Archdeacon Rodney, with his wife Rebecca, one of the
Foxes of Ulverston, and their son the naval officer. There was
Stephen Newmark, close to him Phyllis, now very stout, and four
of their seven offspring, Horace, Mary, Katherine and Emily;
there were, of course, Garth and Sylvia and Amery, that gay
bachelor Fred Ormerod, Bradley Cards and his little wife who was
like a pincushion in figure, Timothy Trenchard, his wife and two
daughters, Carey Rockage, only a year younger than James and
almost as stout, with his wife Cecily and their children Roger
and Alice. John and Elizabeth stood quietly by themselves in a
window. Walter, Will's eldest son, and the new baronet, was not
present, nor was his son Uhland. Everyone thought this
disgraceful.</p>

<p>When Judith entered, followed by Dorothy and Adam, a wave of
emotion swept the whole assembly. Even Lady Herries, who disliked
Judith and was eagerly jealous of her position as the centre of
this day's ceremony, was moved. For this was what the Herries
above all else loved. Survival. Perpetuity. To last longer than
anyone else. To have life and vigour when all your contemporaries
had failed to last. Even as once upon a time they had made eager
bets on the centenary of Great Aunt Maria, so now their
excitement and pride were kindled, for Judith Paris was
seventy-nine and yet walked with a firm step, her head up, her
eyes shining, the most commanding figure of them all.</p>

<p>But there was more than this. Judith had, in all these years,
won a great reputation among them for honesty, kindliness and
fair charity. They were not, on the whole, very charitable to one
another. No members of any family are very charitable to one
another. They know all the wrong things. But Judith, because she
had lived in the North, had been outside their squabbles,
rivalries and jealousies. They thought her a fine
generous-hearted woman. She herself, as she saw all those
Herries, so solemn and so black, felt a strange mixture of two
quite opposite emotions. She thought them absurd and she felt
that she would like to mother them all. They <i>were</i>
absurd--old James so conscious of his baronetcy, so stout, his
black legs like pillows, his grizzled whiskers like cauliflowers;
Newmark, his head perched above a high stock and collar so that
he resembled a dignified but anxious hen; dear Phyllis, so
<i>fearfully</i> fat and her dress so voluminous that all her
brood could comfortably have nestled beneath it; Sylvia, alas, no
longer pretty, badly rouged, the black velvet on her dress cut to
resemble pansies; Rockage, with an odd resemblance to dear old
Maria, long dead, but living again in her son's untidiness and a
kind of shabby good will (how well Judith remembered that
occasion when she had slapped his face at the house in Wiltshire
for his riding to hounds over the drawing-room chairs!); Horace
Newmark, now a plump pale-faced man of thirty-five in large
spectacles and resembling a little in his air of high discontent
Mr Thackeray--yes, they were absurd and lovable too. How Will
would be pleased did he see this great gathering! How he would
approve of the black and the dignity and the solemnity! At the
memory of him, to her own surprise, a tear stole down her cheek.
'Old ladies cry easily!' she thought, as she kissed the widow's
plump cheek.</p>

<p>She walked about among them, and they were all very kind to
her. It was all cr&ecirc;pe and black broadcloth. Robins,
followed by a thin young footman with a cold, walked around
offering sherry and a biscuit.</p>

<p>She sat down in a chair near the darkened windows, and the
low-murmured conversation went on around her like a draught
creeping in through the walls and the floor. It was late February
and very damp. There was a discontented, peevish fire in the huge
fireplace, but as is so often the case with English fireplaces
the heat went up the chimney and left the room severely alone.
Nearly everyone seemed to have colds; the sneezing was
prodigious. It was understood that a thin rain was falling
outside.</p>

<p>Soon she had John and Elizabeth beside her chair. Elizabeth
looked lovely but not, Judith thought, very happy. When Elizabeth
moved away to talk to Margaret, Judith caught John's hand in hers
and said:</p>

<p>'Well, dear John, how are you?'</p>

<p>They were away from the others. She felt his hand clutch hers,
tightly, and had an impulse to put her arms around him and hold
him safe.</p>

<p>'Very well, Aunt Judith, thank you.'</p>

<p>'And the Secretaryship?'</p>

<p>'Oh, splendid! They are so very good to me.'</p>

<p>'And Elizabeth?'</p>

<p>'We are more in love than ever.'</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>'That's right!'</p>

<p>He was the handsomest man in the room by far. But as she
looked at him she caught the oddest resemblance in him to his
father Francis. Just that way had his father looked at Uldale
that night when he had implored her help. Her help against what?
Against nightmares, ghosts, his own frustration . . .</p>

<p>'It's odd, isn't it,' John said, 'Walter and Uhland not
coming?'</p>

<p>'Very wrong of them.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose so. Have you . . . have you seen them at
all?'</p>

<p>'No, my dear.' She smiled grimly. 'They poison our cows once
and again. Walter threatened to bring an action against Bennett's
boy for stealing his timber. Let him try, that's all!'</p>

<p>'Yes, Aunt Judith . . . You know, Elizabeth wrote a letter to
Walter the other day. She thought she ought to. She heard he was
ill.'</p>

<p>'Did she, my dear?'</p>

<p>'He never answered her, though.'</p>

<p>The time had arrived. St. Luke's Chelsea, a church that Will
had attended for many years because he liked its Gothic and the
length of its sermons, was their destination--a long journey at
the pace that their carriages would take them. The hearse had
plumes, almost as large as palm trees. The array of carriages was
magnificent. Judith accompanied Lady Herries and Ellis in the
first carriage.</p>

<p>That is always a problem, the conversation on a funeral
journey, but Lady Herries made it no problem at all. First she
cried, looking out of the carriage window, pleased and satisfied
with the attention that the procession was securing. Then she set
about the task of convincing Judith that her life was now at an
end, that she had only Ellis to live for, and that she alone, of
all God's mortals, had understood Will and given him what he
needed. Ellis, who was now eleven years of age, less shrivelled
than he had been, but bony, horse-faced like all the Herries,
with sharp eyes above a large bony nose, said nothing. Did he
care at all, wondered Judith? Did he know that he had been the
one comfort and pride of his father's old age? At any rate, he
looked like a gentleman. It was extremely difficult for any
Herries <i>not</i> to look like a gentleman, which was perhaps
what was the matter with them. Judith noticed that once and again
Ellis stole a sharp look at her. Of what was he thinking? Of her
age, in all probability. How old she must seem to him! And yet he
had been accustomed to old people! A sudden sympathy for the poor
child caught her. She put out her hand and held his. The little
hand, in its shiny black glove, was as cold as a seashell.</p>

<p>'Will altered,' Lady Herries was saying. 'Altered immensely in
the last years. He depended upon me for everything. I say nothing
against his first wife--' ('You'd better not,' thought Judith)
'--but to pretend that she understood him was absurd. Poor Will!
Everyone thought--even those nearest to him' (this with a glance
at Judith) 'thought that his great interest was money.
Erroneous--quite erroneous. If you had heard the way that he
would talk late in the night--'</p>

<p>Judith began to be angry. But she saw her anger coming from a
long way off. She had, through many years' practice, trained
herself to meet it and turn it back before it reached her heart.
Bad for old ladies to be angry, and in any case waste of time.
But how she did hate this woman! False and greedy and sham! Poor
Will! how lonely in those last years he must have been! Old
pictures began to crowd up again--that familiar one when she and
Will and Francis had watched the fireworks by the Lake and had
prophesied about their lives. Soon she would begin to cry. She
<i>must</i> not cry. She <i>would</i> not before this woman--all
scent, whale-bone and cr&ecirc;pe. She could not see her face for
the heavy black veil that covered it, but she knew how small and
mean those eyes were, how tight and hard the little mouth! Those
were not the thoughts for a funeral, poor dear Will's funeral, so
she looked out of window and saw a French poodle walking beside
an old lady; he had a peaked nose, woolly wig, leggings and
tail-band, and a horrible shaved, salmon-coloured body. The old
lady was younger in years than Judith but not half so vigorous.
She walked as though she were a hundred.</p>

<p>They were passing slowly through a mean, shabby street. Groups
gathered, children ran, men took off their caps--for this moment
the Herries dominated the scene. It did not make them proud. It
was their right, now and always--so much their right that they
gave it scarcely a thought. Here is a gin-palace, here a seedy
French <i>pension,</i> children in torn pinafores gazing at the
sweetshop window, here a rag shop with tobacco-pipes crossed in
the window and turpentine-infected bundles of firewood. Through
all this, drink, poverty, childhood, sweets and tobacco and gin,
Will is grandly riding for the last time!</p>

<p>'Without my care and affection I shudder to think what his
last years would have been--'</p>

<p>Judith clutched the top of her cane with her two little hands.
In all her seventy-nine years, with the single exception of Mrs
Ponder, she had never disliked anyone so much. She heard a sniff,
a strange little strangled sniff. Ellis was crying, tears were
trickling down his bony nose. She put out her arm and drew him
closer to her. He stayed against her as stiff as a whalebone. But
she was glad that he was crying. He <i>had</i> cared for his
father then. He <i>had</i> cared! She would do something for
Ellis. Ask him to Uldale, let him play with Dorothy's children .
. . Then she found that she too, under her veil, was crying, and
suddenly she wanted to lean forward and take Lady Herries' hand.
Perhaps what the woman said was true. She <i>had</i> cared for
Will--in her own peculiar undemonstrative way.</p>

<p>They have arrived at the church. Herries wing out of carriages
like crows from a nesting-tree. But silent. Immensely solemn. How
broad and deep the hat-bands on the black hats, how heavy the
whiskers, the stocks, the voluminous black skirts, the umbrellas,
the thick black boots! A crowd has gathered about the church
door. The church has all its attendant offices and officers--the
stout, self-important beadle, the neatly grained high boxes, the
three-decker pulpit, the wizen-faced pew-openers (two of them).
The church is icily cold, and the hassock on which little Ellis
kneels is hard as iron. He is miserable and feels a sense of
aching loss, although loss of what he has really no idea.</p>

<p>Judith, sitting there, watching the big coffin draped in
black, wondering about the pew-opener in the black bonnet who had
already retired to a corner behind a pillar to count the pennies,
thought that the Herries must have multiplied themselves
threefold since they entered the church. She thought--for her
imagination was fantastic now with weariness and chill--that the
ghosts of departed Herries must have joined the living. Maybe if
she looked more closely she would see poor Warren there, gazing
at her as he used to do with that dog-like devotion, Francis,
Jennifer, even David and Sarah, and Deborah Sunwood whom she had
loved so dearly in her childhood, and Jennifer's father and
mother, and poor Christabel. When you reached her age the dead
and the living were all equally alive--no one was dead, no one
was living.</p>

<p>Yes, Adam was living! He sat beside her, and sometimes he
would look at her to see that all was well with her. Then
quietly, with that solid protection that she loved so in him, he
put his strong arm round her: and then, to her shame, to her
great disgrace, she fell fast asleep!</p>

<p>She woke hurriedly to find that the coffin was leaving the
church and that she, with Lady Herries and Ellis, must
immediately follow it. 'Oh, dear! How disgraceful!' she thought.
'I do hope that nobody saw me!' But she walked down the church,
very firmly, all the Herries' eyes upon her. She did not care for
the family now. She was thinking only of Will--Will, whose last
grand ceremony was over, who would do sums on paper no longer,
would be denied potatoes by Robins never again; with the exit of
that body out of the church one long chapter of her life as well
as his was closed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later they were all in the long dining-room. The table was
covered with food: drink of every kind was on the vast sideboard
that looked as though it had once formed part of a great mahogany
mountain and was still marked with the pick-axes of ardent
climbers. Judith, dizzy with an almost drunken weariness, sat in
a chair near the fireplace. All that she wanted was to go to bed;
meanwhile she must listen to the Family. Inhuman furniture and
human bodies, high mountains of ham and beef, chickens, pies,
great loaves of bread all circled round her together. There was a
marble group near the window--'Sir William Herries, Bart, and
Lady Herries'--poor Christabel like an early Christian Martyr in
a long icy flowing robe. The fender was of painted mahogany.
There were six dessert-stands in ormolu with monkeys carrying
silver nuts. On the mantelpiece were some towering vases of
Copeland ware, gold on a cobalt blue ground.</p>

<p>'Everything is so large,' she thought, and once again had the
old, old wish that her own legs were longer. Soon, however, she
forgot both her weariness and the furniture in her interest in
the conversation that went on around her. They had forgotten her,
all save Adam and Margaret. But, more than that, they had already
forgotten Will. Gone were those hushed voices, vanished that sad
solemnity. As they crowded about the table, eating like wolves
and drinking like the damned, their voices rose ever higher and
higher, their excitement, with every moment, keener.</p>

<p>For now, liberated from that momentary consciousness of poor
William, aware that he was safely underground and that they could
therefore move freely forward with the enterprise and energy that
belonged to their Herries blood, they were discussing the
War.</p>

<p>It was, she reflected, natural that they should do so, for
only yesterday, February 27th, England's ultimatum to Russia had
been despatched. She herself detested war, any war, every war.
She had been in Paris in 1815 and had borne Adam there, seen his
father die there, suffered agonies and terrors that had affected
her whole life. Why anyone should be <i>glad</i> about war she
could not imagine, but not only was everyone in the room
<i>glad,</i> they were <i>triumphant.</i></p>

<p>She saw, too, with that detached observation that came from
her mother Mirabell (who had been quite certainly not at all a
Herries) that this was for them not an English war but a
<i>Herries</i> war. It was the Herries who were indignant at the
Massacre of Sinope, the Herries who applauded and supported every
action of Lord Stratford, the Herries who had advised Lord
Palmerston to resign, the Herries who thought Louis Napoleon a
hero, the Herries who mocked poor Mr Cobden and silly Mr Bright
for their support of the Peace Society.</p>

<p>As Judith listened she realized with every moment more fully
what it was that separated her from the Herries clan and all the
other clans in the world like them--what it was that had
separated her father and Francis and Reuben, what it was that
gave John his terrors and made little Jane walk apart from her
healthy and energetic sisters. Here it was, this quality of the
uneasy imagination, this desire for a beauty that was never to be
caught, this consciousness, pursuing, relentless, unceasing, of a
world <i>behind</i> the world. She could have got up from her
chair and, stamping her cane on the floor, have cried: 'You
fools! You fools! Will nothing teach you?'--but all she did was
to smile a little, refuse a plate of ham courteously offered her
by the Archdeacon, and consider pensively the silver monkeys with
their silver nuts.</p>

<p>So, over Will's dead body, they sang their Song of
Triumph.</p>

<p>Old James, whose chest was congested so that he wheezed like a
harmonium, coughing over his plate of chicken, cried to anyone
who might listen: 'I tell you, sir, these damned Russians must be
put down.' He caught the ear of Cecily Rockage, a thin woman of
sixty who greatly admired him (as she admired indeed everyone,
for she was a humble woman). 'I can tell you for your private
ear, my dear Cecily, that in the Club a day or two back Clarendon
himself told me that in his opinion Newcastle had managed
Palmerston exceedingly well, getting him to withdraw his
resignation without any conditions, you know. Of course, the
Radicals are disgusted, and so they may be. But in my
opinion--'</p>

<p>'That's just what Carey says,' Cecily Rockage murmured,
looking about her in her dim, peering way to see that her beloved
son Roger was having plenty to eat and was thoroughly happy.</p>

<p>'They are important,' Judith thought. 'They are beginning to
cover the country.'</p>

<p>In her Cumberland retreat she had not realized <i>how</i>
important the Herries had grown. Once upon a time there were but
a few of them, a gambler here, someone there riding a horse into
a wilderness, an old man and an old woman drinking over the fire,
but now the times had favoured them. They believed in England,
they believed--almost terribly--in themselves. Oh! how they
believed! What unquestioning confidence they had! Everything,
everything was right with England from her Government to her
furniture, and Judith realized, as she looked about her, as she
heard Ormerod's gay laugh, and the Archdeacon's benevolence, and
Stephen Newmark's solemn blessing, as she saw the women billowing
in happy pride about their men, Sylvia a little elated with wine,
Phyllis the proud mother, Rodney's Rebecca the eager listener,
that there was something fine and grand in their faith, that
these men and women <i>were</i> making England what she was,
England the dominant Power of the world, the Queen of the
Earth!</p>

<p>Only--was it worth the trouble: all this hard work, energy,
faith? Queen of the Earth! <i>Was</i> that really important?</p>

<p>'I am really very tired, darling,' she whispered to Adam. 'I
think I'll go up to bed if no one minds.'</p>

<p>No one minded. Earlier in the day, when William was still
above ground, she was of importance. Now she was forgotten;
England's Glory had taken her place.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later Adam came to say goodnight to his mother. As he climbed
the high stairs, leaving the boom and whisper of voices behind
him, he felt a great longing to take his mother and Margaret,
wrap them in shawls and whisk them off, with himself, to a desert
island--a glorious island of burning sun, coral sand, heat and
light and colour. The three of them alone, living for ever,
always warm, always private, telling one another stories, and
making necklaces of shells. He stopped on the landing opposite a
dark engraving of Prince Albert and the Queen, and laughed. Two
mice heard him laugh and, surprised out of their lives, whisked
away.</p>

<p>He entered his mother's room carefully. There was a fire
burning; the copper scuttle-scoop, the brass fender, the steel
fire-irons shone resplendently. The old lady was lying, her
pillows propped up behind her, apparently staring at a large oil
painting entitled 'Little Black Sambo', which showed a small
black child daintily covered with the leaf of a palm tree,
sitting on the seashore sucking his thumb while two little white
girls, clad immaculately in muslin and long pantaloons, stared at
him with speculation. The firelight danced on the wall; the rain
beat against the pane--it was not an uncheerful scene. She did
not turn her head nor move when he entered. In spite of his heavy
figure he trod very gently, sat down on a chair beside the bed
and waited.</p>

<p>Then suddenly an awful fear seized him that she was going to
die. Her face was always pale, but her small hands as they lay on
the gay patchwork quilt had a marble pallor. And she lay so very
still. She was, after all, of a great age. She should never have
made the journey to London; this day must have been of a fearful
exhaustion for her.</p>

<p>The thought that he might lose her at any moment now--that she
might go out like a candle carelessly blown by the wind--made him
catch his breath, constricted his heart. The only three people in
the world whom he loved, now that Caesar Kraft was dead, were his
mother and Margaret and John. His nature was deeply modest,
acutely sensitive. He could not believe that men and women liked
him, and it was true that, at present, very few knew him because
he was so silent about himself and thought himself a useless,
cumbering failure. He had had great ambitions for the good of man
and they had all failed. At that moment when Kraft had fallen and
died at his feet, all his hope of helping his brother man had
died. He had not the confidence nor the power nor the will. He
was so shy of thrusting himself forward, so shy of display or
self-advertisement, that men thought him proud and arrogant. At
the newspaper office, in the little Club to which he belonged,
even with a man like Charles Dickens, genial, friendly,
exuberant, he could not let himself go. But these two women
understood him, his mother and Margaret understood him, and to
lose one of them . . .</p>

<p>And there was one more thing. He was only half alive in
London. His soul ached for Cumberland, but Margaret did not like
it. She was unhappy there. Stones and clouds, clouds and stones .
. .</p>

<p>She turned her head and saw him. She put out her hand and
caught his.</p>

<p>'Dear me, how nice, Adam! I have been dreaming, I suppose. But
I don't know. I never know now whether I am dreaming or not . . .
I was very tired, I must say, but bed is most comforting. There
is no place like bed. I am sure that I never expected to feel
that. I used to be so very energetic. But it's my body that's
tired, not my spirit . . . How disgusting old James is, eating
such a lot at his age!'</p>

<p>They talked quietly and happily together.</p>

<p>'Mother,' Adam said. 'One thing I hadn't told you. Will
Leathwaite is coming to London to be my servant.'</p>

<p>That interested her. 'Is he indeed? What a good thing! I like
Will so very much.'</p>

<p>'Of course it's absurd that I should have a servant with the
little I make. But he wants to come. He says he doesn't care what
I pay him, and it will be a little piece of home.'</p>

<p>'A very big piece,' Judith remarked, chuckling. 'That's nice
for you, dear. Are they still guzzling and drinking down
there?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so.'</p>

<p>'And what a deal they talk. Chatter, chatter, chatter. They
are all delighted there's a war--why, I cannot imagine.' She
closed her eyes and dreamt again. She talked as though out of a
dream. 'I fancied just now that God was in the room. A God a
little like Georges and a little like yourself, Adam. Perhaps
that's what God will be--composed of the people we love most. He
was so very kind and most reassuring. I have never been a
religious woman, you know, Adam. Reuben Sunwood used to be
greatly disappointed with me. He was so very certain. But I
suppose an old woman may be allowed her fancies. I find that
everyone is very certain about God in these days. Quite different
from when I was a girl. It's as though they had made Him
themselves.'</p>

<p>She sat up, climbing up out of her dream, full of energy
again.</p>

<p>'I do hope you are happy, dear Adam,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said. 'When I am with you and Margaret, Mother. But
I'm terribly shy. It grows on me, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>'Yes, your father was the same. But I shouldn't worry. We are
different--you and I and poor John and little Jane. And the
Herries family is an awkward family to be different in. All my
life I have been fighting them. And now I am not fighting anyone
any longer, even Walter. Too much trouble.'</p>

<p>She lay back again, closing her eyes.</p>

<p>'How lovely life is, all of it--having a baby, fighting
Walter, pains and aches, food and riding up to Watendlath, poor
Jennifer, the garden at Uldale, dear Adam, dear, dear Adam . .
.'</p>

<p>She had fallen asleep. He sat there for some while watching
her, then bent down and kissed, very gently, her forehead, then
stole from the room.</p>

<h1>JUDITH AND WALTER</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Will Leathwaite had come to say farewell. He was going at
last, after six months' delay, to London to be Adam's servant.
Judith was able to sit on the lawn in the September sunshine, it
was so warm. The sun had the shininess of a hot sea and the lawn
was like misty waters; the colours seemed gently to roll in
shades of pale citron, of silver-grey, from the floor of the
little Gothic temple to the walls, faintly pink, of the beloved
house. Across the road, beyond the old peach-stained stones, rose
the shadowed forms of the mountains, stretching themselves like
great luxurious cats in the sunshine. A flight of curlews broke
the pale wash of the sky, and you could feel, even though you
could not see, the rough grass of the brown moorland, the icy
glitter under the warm sun of the running moorland streams. Those
green slopes, as yet scarcely purpled with heather, heaped up
like a wave above the house answering the plaintive windy cry of
the curlews.</p>

<p>In the middle of this peace, listening as always for her
delight to the rhythm of running water, water slipping happily
under the sunlight, she said goodbye to Will Leathwaite. It was
as though she were sending Adam a piece of the North. Will was
nearly fifty now and towered above her as he stood, his cap in
his hand, staring in front of him. His colouring was very fair
and there was a bald patch on the very top of his round
bullet-like head. His features were stamped with simplicity,
obstinacy, strength and kindliness; his cheeks were russet with
good health, and there were little wrinkles at the corners of his
very blue eyes that spoke of extreme good-nature. His body was
large, broad, clumsy, his shoulders a little bowed. It was plain
that he saw only one thing at a time and that once he had an idea
in his head, nothing--no earthquake, no thunderbolt--could loosen
it. He stood up in the thin Northern sunlight as though he had
been created by it.</p>

<p>'Well, Will, you will look after Mr Adam, will you not?'</p>

<p>'I will, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Will you like town life, do you think? It is very different
from anything you've been used to.'</p>

<p>'So long as Mr Adam is satisfied, I'm ready,' he answered.</p>

<p>'It will be a great thing for Mr Adam. He hasn't many friends,
you know.'</p>

<p>'Yes. T'nature of him is slow like my own, ma'am.' Then he
smiled, a delightful slow, considering smile. 'T'best way, I
think, ma'am.'</p>

<p>The children, Amabel and Jane, ran across the lawn, laughing
and shouting, with a ball. He turned and watched them with a
quiet decorous pleasure.</p>

<p>'Write to me, Will, and tell me how you find everything.'</p>

<p>'Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.'</p>

<p>He touched his yellow forelock and stepped slowly, steadily
away, moving his great body with the ease and dignity of a
gentleman in his own right. She sighed happily. It would be nice
for Adam to have so trustworthy a man at his side.</p>

<p>She was glad that she was feeling strong and vigorous and that
the air was warm, because she had much to think about. Both
Margaret and John were staying in the house. Adam had written to
say that Margaret was tired with the London air and needed a
holiday, so she had been at Uldale a week and, so far, the visit
had been a great success.</p>

<p>John had suddenly appeared with only a telegram's warning. No
one knew why he had come. Then Elizabeth had written to say that
she had sent him because he could not sleep in London. The summer
had been hot: his master was in Switzerland. She herself was
going to stay with the Rockages at Grosset. It was better that
she and John should be apart for a while. This was sufficiently
alarming, but John had said nothing until suddenly last evening,
wishing Judith goodnight, he had told her that Elizabeth was
going to have a baby.</p>

<p>'It's all wrong, Aunt Judith,' he burst out. 'I should not
have a child.' He was quivering and his face was strained with
distress.</p>

<p>'What nonsense!' she said. 'I never heard greater nonsense.
Why, it's splendid for dear Elizabeth to have a baby.'</p>

<p>'It will be a coward--as my father was, as I am.'</p>

<p>He left the room without another word.</p>

<p>After that she slept very badly. Dream followed dream, and
every dream was filled with apprehension. Every part of her past
life seemed, in her dreams, to be now connected and to point to
some inevitable result. She was once again with Georges at
Christabel's Ball, with Charlie Watson in Watendlath, with Warren
in Paris, and someone cried in her ear: 'Had it not been thus
this would never have come about.'</p>

<p>'But what?' she cried.</p>

<p>But she could not see the event. She struggled, her heart full
of love and fear. Adam, approaching her, tried to speak to her
but was prevented. John waved to her a despairing hand before he
vanished from sight. But she could do nothing. She was held, as
one is in dreams, impotent, with no power in her limbs to move.
Suddenly the old cruel figure of Mrs Ponder, Jennifer's servant,
appeared. She was on her knees searching Judith's private
papers.</p>

<p>'<i>Now</i> you will have to leave the house!' she cried,
raising her malignant face.</p>

<p>'But I will not!' Judith answered.</p>

<p>And she had not. That was one thing upon which she could look
back with pleasure, that in spite of all the odiousness and
spying, in spite of Jennifer's lazy treachery, she had faced Mrs
Ponder to the end, seeing the hateful woman at last out of the
house. But what had Mrs Ponder to do with John? Ah, she
remembered the little scene when that vile woman had thrown
John's rabbit out of window. Was that, too, one link in the
chain? Had every event, however slight, its inevitable result?
But she must do something about John. She must not allow him to
slip into tragedy as his father, Francis, had done. She must do
something about John, and then she looked up to see Margaret
coming across the grass towards her. She was now thirty-four
years of age and a fine strongly built woman with a broad
carriage, a calm open countenance and great quietness and repose
in all her movements.</p>

<p>'She has grown,' Judith thought, 'like Adam and Adam like her,
as many married people do when they have lived much together and
love one another.' As she thought this a spasm of the old
jealousy bit her as it might be a little animal jumping from the
grass, but she brushed it away with her hand.</p>

<p>Margaret was wearing a simple grey muslin with panniers of
white taffeta <i>placed</i> at the edges. In the bosom of her
dress she had a white rose. Her dark hair was brushed back on
either side, parted in the middle. She was carrying her hat in
her hand. She brought peace and assurance with her.</p>

<p>'I like this woman,' Judith thought, as though she were seeing
her for the first time. 'I am friends with her at last.'</p>

<p>The children had tired of their game and had run into the
house. The sun was very slowly sinking, and the golden glow
moved, travelling from place to place, softening the mountains
with a purple flush while the sky faded slowly from bright blue
into a translucent amber. Soon there will be a world of grey and
silver and the hill will be dark, chill and strong. But that is
not yet. The two women have half an hour to talk, the running
stream the only sound in the world save their voices.</p>

<p>'You will not be cold, Mother?' Margaret asked, laying her
broad strong hand on Judith's black dress.</p>

<p>'Oh no, my dear. And see that the grass is not damp for
you.'</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. 'I have so many petticoats,' she said, 'I
could sit in a stream and not be wet.'</p>

<p>Her voluminous grey dress spread out on the green grass and
the light transmuted it.</p>

<p>'Have you seen John?' Judith asked.</p>

<p>'No; he has been away all day,' Margaret answered, sighing.
'He seems dreadfully unhappy. He has been so for months. He would
talk to Adam at one time, but lately he has avoided him too, and
Adam loves him so much. Elizabeth says that he will not talk to
her either.'</p>

<p>'Yes--he is as his father was.' Judith beat her small hands
impatiently on her lap. 'I can catch hold of <i>nothing</i>.'</p>

<p>'Adam thinks,' Margaret began, 'that it all began from the day
when someone near here told him about his father and mother. He
had a shock then that has weakened him like water, and it is of
no use to say that he <i>ought</i> not, that I would not be like
that, that <i>I</i> would not let the past touch me. We are all
different, and it seems to me that the Herries who <i>are</i>
weak are weaker than any others, as though someone had said once:
"If you are born a Herries and refuse to have common-sense you
shall suffer as no one else suffers. Have common-sense or die."
Adam has just enough common-sense to save him.'</p>

<p>'Well, he is only half a Herries, my dear,' Judith said
briskly. 'His father was only half a Herries and I am only by
nature quarter a one, for my father was a wanderer and a vagabond
and so was my mother. And here I am as warm and comfortable as a
cat, thank goodness. It's more than I have deserved.'</p>

<p>Margaret hesitated. She found words no more easily than Adam,
but there was something that she had been wanting for a long
while to say, and now was a good time.</p>

<p>'Mother,' she began at last, slowly, in her deep rich voice,
looking down at the grass. 'You do not hate me any longer, do
you?'</p>

<p>'Hate you? Why, no, my child, I love you.'</p>

<p>'You did hate me once.'</p>

<p>Judith shook her head. 'No, I never hated you, of course. How
could I when Adam loved you?--and besides all my life I must
confess that I have found it very difficult to hate anyone.
John's mother for a while once, and a horrid servant she had.
Walter, perhaps, at odd moments. No. But I was jealous of you, I
must confess.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I knew it.' Margaret stroked the grass with her hand.
'And it made me terribly unhappy. But I have never been able to
express myself. I am so very shy of feeling, and women are not
supposed to have any feelings. It is not thought nice.'</p>

<p>'In my young day,' Judith said, nodding her head vigorously,
'women had plenty of feeling and showed it. I don't know what's
come over the world. Women are not supposed to have legs any
more, and children are found in gooseberry bushes. Stuff!'</p>

<p>'And you are not jealous any more?'</p>

<p>'No. All my fires have died down. I sit and look on. But I
love you, my dear. I do indeed. Adam has been the passion of all
my life since my husband died, but a time came when I saw that
someone else must do the things for him that I had done--and more
things than I could ever do. How fortunate I have been that it
was a woman like you, not one of these coarse painted creatures
or one of these niminy-piminies all affectation, or one of those
good perfect creatures like the woman in Mr Dickens' <i>David
Copperfield.</i> What was her name? Agnes. But, of course, Adam
would have chosen well. He would have had a whipping from me if
he had not.'</p>

<p>'I have wanted to tell you,' Margaret said slowly, 'how
grateful I am to you, how dearly I love you. I cannot say things,
but I thought that once I must tell you--'</p>

<p>She leant up and put her arms around Judith. The two women
kissed, and Judith laid her hand for a moment on Margaret's broad
forehead.</p>

<p>'God bless you and keep you in all His ways, dear daughter.
And now,' she went on quite sharply, 'I must go in. The sun will
soon be down. How nice! I shall read Mrs Gaskell's
<i>Cranford</i> over the fire. They say it is all about old
ladies who are frightened by cows--like Mrs Potter at Threlkeld.
Give me your arm, my dear. My right foot has gone fast
asleep.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A little later she was sitting in front of the parlour fire,
her feet propped up on a worsted stool, a thick woollen shawl
round her shoulders, and large spectacles on the end of her small
nose. Her trouble was that her nose was <i>too</i> small. The
spectacles <i>would</i> slip off! It was only of late that her
eyes had begun to fail her. She was reading <i>Cranford</i> with
many chuckles.</p>

<p>'How true this is! We are just the same here round Uldale.
"<i>In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the
Amazons--all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are
women. If a married couple come to settle in the town, somehow
the gentleman disappears; he is either fairly frightened to death
by being the only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is
accounted for by being with his regiment, his ship, or closely
engaged in business all the week in the great neighbouring
commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a
railroad. In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they
are not at Cranford; . . . but every man cannot be a surgeon. For
keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to
speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully
at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the
geese that occasionally venture into the gardens if the gates are
left open; for deciding all questions of literature and politics
without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or
arguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of
everybody's affairs in the parish; for keeping their neat
maidservants in admirable order; for kindness (somewhat
dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices to each
other whenever they are in distress--the ladies of Cranford are
quite sufficient</i>."'</p>

<p>Judith laid the book down on her lap and considered.</p>

<p>'How very excellent! That is exactly Miss Poole and Janet and
Mary Darlington and Mrs Withers and Mrs Spooner. We are a world
of women. Why? Why is Dorothy so important? She is not very
clever nor is she at all beautiful, but she has a kind of
kingdom. Now I <i>never</i> had a kingdom--'</p>

<p>The door opened. The little maid Eliza, her face twisted from
its rosy simplicity with surprise, horror, alarm, excitement and
general sense of drama, whispered something.</p>

<p>'What do you say, Eliza?' Judith asked, turning round and
pushing her spectacles back on to her nose.</p>

<p>'Sir Walter Herries, ma'am.'</p>

<p>Walter! Her book dropped to the floor. She stayed, for a
moment, listening as though she expected to hear some dreadful
sound, but all that came to her was the cheerful shrill voice of
someone singing in the kitchen. Then, sitting up very straight,
she said:</p>

<p>'Ask Sir Walter to come in.'</p>

<p>A moment later he was standing beside the sofa, very stiffly
bowing. He was dressed for riding and carried his hat in his
hand. His hair was grey now (he was sixty-two) and he was
clean-shaven, which was most unusual and gave him an odd babyish
appearance. His red face was purple-veined, but he was not so
stout as when Judith had last seen him. He was untidy, as though
he had no one to look after him. Judith, against her wish, felt
sorry for him.</p>

<p>'Well, Walter, how are you? Won't you sit down? Been poisoning
any of our cows lately? How are the little Peaches? Humphrey, the
stableman, found one of them in our gooseberry bushes not long
ago.'</p>

<p>Walter sat down. He spread his legs, looked gravely at her;
she noticed that his mouth was not very steady and that his hands
shook.</p>

<p>'You are looking well, Judith,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am very well, thank you.' She took off her spectacles. She
did not intend that he should say that her sight was going. Then
sharply, as though to convey to him that she had not all day to
waste:</p>

<p>'Why am I honoured?'</p>

<p>'A damned pretty place you've got,' he said, looking about
him. 'Everything very fresh and charming.'</p>

<p>'Well--well. That's not what you've come to say.'</p>

<p>'No, it isn't. Sharp as ever you were!'</p>

<p>'Nor have you come to pay me compliments. Do you mind that
window? If so, pray close it.' (For the window was open. Judith,
unlike her contemporaries, loved fresh air.)</p>

<p>'No matter, thank you.' He hummed and hawed, then began a long
rambling statement.</p>

<p>She could not make out what he was after. He had a lot to say
about the past. Was it not foolish that they had wasted so much
of their lives in quarrelling? He had been a young hot-headed
fool, had done many things that he now regretted. Looking back,
his ill-temper seemed to him now to have been very aimless,
motiveless. But it was his father who, from the time he was a
baby, had persuaded him that his mother had been insulted, and
then Jennifer and Francis--well, Judith would agree that their
conduct . . .</p>

<p>'I will agree to nothing,' Judith said.</p>

<p>But he did not appear to hear her. He went rambling on. He was
afraid that he'd taught Uhland the same doctrine. He saw now what
a mistake he had made. He saw now that he had been mistaken in
many things.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm glad of that anyway,' said Judith. 'But there is no
use to go back on the past. If you are asking me to forget and
forgive, Walter, frankly I cannot. Too much harm has been
done--Francis, Jennifer, Reuben, and Jennifer's children. My own
life, too . . .' She coughed. She could not but be sorry for him
a little. There were spots on his waistcoat, and his stock was
badly tied. 'But what do you <i>want,</i> Walter? What have you
come here for?'</p>

<p>He hesitated, looked at her as though he were begging her to
help him. Then he said an extraordinary thing.</p>

<p>'Hatred, Judith, is a very rare quality in men. One seldom
meets it.'</p>

<p>She did not know what to say.</p>

<p>'Very rare,' she answered drily.</p>

<p>'I have never hated you. My mother never hated anybody.
Jennifer never hated anyone. You yourself have never hated.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'What I intend to say is--I am clumsy at expressing
myself--but out of all this past quarrelling, not very real, you
understand, there has come much unhappiness.' He paused, rubbed
his cheek with his hand. 'I myself am not a happy man. All my own
fault, I admit it. I have lost my daughter quite through my own
fault. There is something bad in our blood which, if it is
indulged--'</p>

<p>He stared at her in quite a fuddled way as though he had been
drinking, which it was likely that he had. But what was his
meaning? What was his intention? For what had he come? She
remembered the scene in this very room when she had slapped his
face. He was not the kind of man either to condone or forget.</p>

<p>'Hatred, Judith,--real hatred--is a sort of madness.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>He went on again, finding words very difficult.</p>

<p>'You see . . . you know . . . you must understand . . . Upon
my word, I am extremely clumsy--you must forgive me--but my
boy--Uhland--'</p>

<p>'Yes--Uhland?' she said, more softly, because now, as always
when he spoke of his son, there was a new and moving note in his
voice.</p>

<p>'I had great hopes for Uhland. I may be a man who has made a
mess of his life. When I am sober I am ready to make such an
admission--but Uhland was to be different. He had a heavy
handicap' (his voice was gathering ardour now that Uhland was his
topic) 'his lameness--the sense that he was unlike the others.
And then his mother was not strong, and I was not the wisest
father. I was anxious to indulge him, too anxious perhaps, and he
was unusual, unlike other boys--'</p>

<p>He paused again, and gently, looking at him almost as though
she were his friend, Judith said:</p>

<p>'Yes, Walter, I understand. In that at least I have always
understood you.'</p>

<p>Encouraged, he went on:</p>

<p>'I am another man when I am in my cups. I will be quite honest
with you. I have spoiled many things by my follies, but Uhland I
have always kept apart. I saw from the beginning that he was by
himself, alone. He has never cared for anyone except your Adam.
He has never, I fear, cared in the least for myself, and the
knowledge that he did not made me wilder, wilder than perhaps I
would otherwise have been. But what I would point out is that all
our quarrels, yours and mine and our parents' before us--the
events in the life of your own father so many years ago--have
found a kind of resting-place in poor Uhland's nature. He was
born with a grudge and all his instincts have been twisted. In a
fashion he is a scapegoat for the errors of the rest of us.' He
stopped once more, wiped his mouth with his hand.</p>

<p>She was, in spite of herself, deeply touched. This was a
different Walter from any that she had ever seen. She felt behind
his precise, artificial, clumsy speech almost an agony of
apprehension, and her own apprehension that she had been so
conscious of all day rose to meet his.</p>

<p>She almost cried out:</p>

<p>'Oh, Walter, what is it? What has happened?'</p>

<p>Enemies though they had been all their lives, they were now
almost allies.</p>

<p>He went on, staring at her as though that assisted him.</p>

<p>'Uhland has grown ever more strange. Our house is not an
agreeable place. I will not pretend that it is agreeable, but of
late Uhland's conduct has frightened me greatly--'</p>

<p>'Uhland's conduct?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' He found now the greatest difficulty in choosing his
words. 'He is, I fear, most unhappy, but he will speak to no one.
He shuts himself in his room. He walks over the house. The
servants are afraid to remain where he is. And for myself, I
think he hates me.'</p>

<p>She said nothing. He went on more swiftly.</p>

<p>'But it is not of myself that I wanted to speak to you. I came
. . . I came because--' He said urgently, leaning towards her:
'You have John staying with you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>

<p>'You know, of course, that from the time of his childhood
Uhland has always especially hated John.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>

<p>'It has been a sort of madness in him. I fear, I greatly fear
that I was myself originally responsible for that. It seemed to
me in those days unfair--unfair that John should be so handsome
while my son--'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know, I know,' Judith said quickly.</p>

<p>'Then I implore you, Judith--I beg of you--send John back to
London immediately. Immediately. Uhland knows that he is here. He
has, during the last week, been very odd in his behaviour. He
talks--he was talking last night--as though that old grudge had
reached some kind of climax. We are, all of us, responsible for
the past, I more than any, and if anything were to happen--'</p>

<p>'But what could happen?'</p>

<p>'There have been many acts of violence in our family,' he went
on. 'It is as though there were an element of violence in our
blood . . . No. This is perhaps foolish, unreal. We are, I
suppose, the most sober and sensible family in England, and just
because of that when we are not sensible--'</p>

<p>He got up and she could see that he was greatly agitated.</p>

<p>'Never mind our family,' he said. 'Damn the family! This is
urgent, personal to ourselves. I implore you, send John back to
London tomorrow.'</p>

<p>She nodded. She looked up and gave him her hand for the first
time for many years.</p>

<p>'Yes, Walter. You are right. Thank you for coming. It could
not have been easy. John shall return to London. In fact this is
no new thing. I have been aware of it for many years. John has
been under some kind of shadow all his life, as his father was
before him. I will see that he goes tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Walter held her hand, looked at her, bowed, then said almost
defiantly:</p>

<p>'I have not come here to confess my sins, Judith. I shall be
tomorrow as I was yesterday. I shall find myself a fool, I don't
doubt, for coming to visit you. But for an hour at least I see
sense. Goodbye. I can find my own way out.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Judith sat on, her hands folded in front of her, looking into
the fire, wondering as to which would be the best way to persuade
John. This, had she known it, was a waste of energy, for John had
heard everything, standing among some flowerpots, his hands
scratched unwittingly by the nails of rose-briars fastened to the
wall. He had returned from his ride and had seen Walter's horse
tied to the gate. A quarter of an hour before he had seen both
Walter and Uhland riding down the road from Ireby. He had come
round the wing of the house towards the front door when, very
clearly through the open window, he had heard the words in
Walter's thick ropy voice: 'You know, of course, that from the
time of his childhood Uhland has always especially hated
John.'</p>

<p>So he stayed there, his body pressed against the wall, his
eyes staring out into a sky that swam in frosty September light
with one blazing diamond star. He heard everything. He heard
Walter say: 'If anything were to happen--', and Judith later:
'Yes, Walter. You are right . . . John has been under some kind
of shadow . . .'</p>

<p>So it had come to this! 'Under some kind of shadow! Under some
kind of shadow.' And they planned to smuggle him away to London
lest anything should happen . . . anything should happen.</p>

<p>He went back to the stable and got out his horse Barnabas. A
small terrier, very devoted to him, Mumps by name, little more
than a puppy, came rushing across the cobbles when he saw
Barnabas let out again. He had thought that the fun was over for
the day, but apparently it was not. John went quickly by the gate
that bordered the orchard. This brought him straight into the
village street and he knew that he would be now ahead of Walter.
The sun was just sinking, and hills, fields, pasture and stream
lay in a mirror of light; you could fancy that if you swung,
lazily, god-like in the sky, you would look down and see your
Olympian features reflected in this sea of gold. Almost at once,
just out of the village, at the dip in the road before it turned
left to Peterfield, he found Uhland, waiting for his father,
while his horse cropped the grass.</p>

<p>He knew that he had very little time before Walter came up,
and, guiding his horse quite close to Uhland's, he said
softly:</p>

<p>'I think that we must end this. It has gone on long
enough--and by ourselves where no one can disturb us.'</p>

<p>It was as though because of their connexion through so many
years they had grown to understand one another like the closest
and dearest friends, for Uhland did not appear startled, nor did
he ask 'End what?' or 'What has been long enough?' He simply drew
his horse a little away from John's and nodded his head.</p>

<p>'Well--if you wish it. As to ending it--' Then he said sharply
in his cold rather thin voice: 'What is it you want?'</p>

<p>'That we should have it out, the two of us, once and for
all--alone.'</p>

<p>They both heard the tap-tap of a horse on the road. It would
be, likely, Walter.</p>

<p>'Yes, I agree.'</p>

<p>They were like two schoolboys arranging a rendezvous for a
fight; from the beginning there had been something childlike and
something eternal too in their relationship.</p>

<p>Uhland went on, as though to himself: 'Yes, I have had enough
of this. I must get rid of this.' He said coldly: 'Well--what do
you propose?'</p>

<p>'Tomorrow. I will meet you somewhere.'</p>

<p>Uhland paused. They could see Walter coming down the hill.</p>

<p>'Yes. What do you say to the house opposite Calva in Skiddaw
Forest? Tomorrow afternoon at four.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I'll be there.'</p>

<p>John turned his horse and a moment later passed Walter without
a word or any greeting.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the following day, Uhland, waking very early in his tower,
lighted his candle and began to read in a brown stubby volume. It
was a translation of Vasari's <i>Lives of the Italian
Painters.</i> After a while he came to this: '<i>Whereupon having
taken this buckler with him to Florence without telling Leonardo
whose it was, Ser Piero asked him to paint something upon it.
Leonardo having taken one day this buckler in his hands, and
seeing it twisted, ill-made and clumsy, straightened it by the
fire, and having given it to a turner, from the rough and clumsy
thing that it was, caused it to be made smooth and equal; and</i>
<i>afterwards, having covered it with</i> gesso <i>and having
prepared it after his own method, he began to think of what he
might paint on it, that should be able to terrify all who should
come upon it, producing the same effect as once did the head of
Medusa. Leonardo therefore, to this end, carried to a room into
which no one entered save himself, slow-worms, lizards,
field-crickets, snakes, moths, grasshoppers, bats and other kinds
of such-like animals, out of the number of which, variously put
together, he evolved a most horrible and terrifying creature,
which poisoned the air with its breath, and turned it into flame;
and he represented it coming out of a dark and jagged rock,
belching poison from its open throat, and fire from its eyes, and
smoke from its nostrils, in so strange a manner that it seemed
altogether a monstrous and horrible thing; and such pains did he
take in executing it, that although the smell of the dead animals
in the room was very noisome, it was not perceived by Leonardo,
so great was the passion that he bore towards his art . .
.</i>'</p>

<p>'So great was the passion that he bore towards his art,'
Uhland repeated to himself and closed the book and blew out his
candle to let the moth-like colour of the early morning
strengthen in the room. So it was to be a great artist, such
would he have done had he had the opportunity and the power. He
had neither, only the longing. He had done nothing with his life,
which now was over. He was certain that it was over and that this
was the last time that he would see the early light spread about
the room. But today he would release something from within
himself that had been there since he was conceived. If he could
live after that was released--ah! then perhaps he would become an
artist.</p>

<p>He always had a headache now when he woke in the morning, a
pain that pressed on his forehead like iron, and his eyes for the
first hour were misted so that he had read the Vasari with great
difficulty, and his lame leg hurt him sorely. But this morning
when later he bathed and dressed he felt a glow, a warmth, a deep
and burning excitement. That miserable coward had at last faced
up to him. He would see him standing in front of him. They would
be alone, removed from all the world. He would strike him in the
face and see what he would do. This was the moment for which all
his life he had been longing, to revenge himself upon the whole
world for making him twisted and a cripple, all those people who
had watched him as he walked, all the kind Herries relations who
had despised and pitied him. Today he would revenge himself upon
all his family--the crowd of them, so pleased with themselves and
their strong bodies and the children they had begotten, so
scornful of anyone unlike themselves . . . and the fellow had
dared--had dared--to marry his sister!</p>

<p>All morning he limped about the house thinking of a thousand
absurd things--how his grandfather Will, now, Heaven be praised,
dust and ashes, had looked at him across the dining-table in Hill
Street as though he said: 'This poor misshapen creature--how can
he be <i>my</i> grandson?' How Amery had invited him to ride with
him, adding: 'You <i>can</i> ride, can't you?' How he had slipped
on the stair at the Fortress, and Archdeacon Rodney's young son
had muttered (but Uhland had heard him): 'Poor devil!' How Sylvia
had looked at his leg and then blushed when he caught her--all,
all, all pitying him, despising him, scorning him! Leonardo had
filled his room with newts and toads and lizards and from them
had constructed a figure so horrible . . . There was power! Ah!
there was power indeed! And today he would be revenged on them
all. He would make that figure, seen all his days as the type of
all that he himself despised and hated, cringe and shake and
fall--a strange fire ran in his veins so that he felt almost as
though his limp were gone and he as strong as any of them.</p>

<p>With the exception of his own place and the servants'
quarters, his father's room was the only one in all the Fortress
now that was cared for. The rest was tumbling to ruin. The walls
were strong, but dust lay everywhere, and all the other rooms
were damp-smelling and foetid. But he went everywhere as though
he were saying goodbye to it all, a happy, glad goodbye. They
called it the Fortress first in admiration, now in jest and
mockery. So with this damned country: they thought that they were
building a Fortress, eaten up with conceit they were, but one day
it would be like this house, rotten and a jest to all the world.
Pity he couldn't live to see that day . . .</p>

<p>Later, with his gun over his shoulder, he went in to say
farewell to his father.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Herries, Bart, was playing backgammon with his
housekeeper, a thin painted woman called Mrs Throstle. Mrs
Throstle enjoyed bright colours and was expecting friends from
Keswick, so she was dressed in a worsted poplin of bright yellow
and wore the most elaborate sleeves in the prevailing fashion,
ruffed muslin with coloured ribbons at the wrist. She had coral
bracelets. Over all this her sharp face peered anxiously at the
board, for she was a mean woman, and they were playing for high
stakes. Or so they seemed to her. But she always came out right
in the end, because if she won she won, and if she lost she went
through Herries' pockets at night after he slept and took what
there was. But there was not much these days because everything
was going to rack and ruin.</p>

<p>She was discontented, too, because Herries would not drink at
present. He was sober and cross and peevish. He had struck her
last night for saying that Uhland was a lame duck. She hated
Uhland, as indeed did all the servants.</p>

<p>Walter, very soberly dressed, gave only half his attention to
the game. He had been worried for weeks about Uhland, and his
visit to Judith yesterday had done little to relieve him. Indeed,
it had added to his discontent, for the Uldale house had looked
so bright and shining. He had liked Judith too, that neat,
capable, strong old woman, and all the silly enmity over which he
had spent so much of his energy seemed to have blown into thin
air. But enmity, hatred and all uncharitableness are never
wasted, as he was to find out before many days were over.</p>

<p>He looked up at the door opening and hungered with love for
his son. He saw that he was dressed for going out and had a gun
over his shoulder; at once he was alarmed with a strange interior
fear, the room seemed to fill with smoke before his eyes; his
hand trembled, and he knocked the backgammon board off the
table.</p>

<p>'There now!' said Mrs Throstle. 'And I was winning too!'</p>

<p>'Clear out!' said Uhland sharply. 'I want to speak to my
father.'</p>

<p>Mrs Throstle rose, trembling. She was terrified of Uhland; one
look at his contemptuous face and she shook all over. She
gathered herself together, touched her coral bracelets
indignantly, tossed her head and went. The round backgammon
counters lay on the dirty carpet, but Walter stared at his
son.</p>

<p>'Going out?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, Father.'</p>

<p>'Shooting?'</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>Walter rose heavily, stretched his arms and yawned.</p>

<p>'I think I'll come too. Fresh air will do me good.'</p>

<p>'No, Father. I'm going alone today.'</p>

<p>Uhland looked at his father and felt, to his own surprise, a
certain tenderness. He could remember--he did at this moment
vividly remember--old, old days at Westaways when everything had
been so rich, many people about, the house shining with colour,
and his father bursting with health and self-satisfaction. But
his father had wasted himself on emptiness, had let everything
dribble through his hands like grain falling idly through the
air. Grain falling--it lay now, in layers of dust, thick upon the
floor. They had done nothing with their lives, either of them,
and he saw for perhaps the first time that if he had returned
some of his father's love things might have been otherwise. His
father had had no return for either his love or his hate. A dry,
wasted man . . .</p>

<p>He did what of his own free will he had never done
before--limped up and put his hand on his father's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Better I go alone,' he said. 'I'm in a sulky temper.'</p>

<p>Walter was so deeply moved by his son's gesture that he said
angrily: 'You are always in a sulky temper.' He leaned his big
heavy body towards his son's. He touched the gun.</p>

<p>'Going shooting?' he asked again.</p>

<p>'Maybe,' answered Uhland. 'Goodbye then.' He moved towards the
door.</p>

<p>'When are you returning?'</p>

<p>'Oh, any time. Don't count on it,' and he went out, his
backward glance from the door showing him his father bending his
great stern towards the floor that he might pick up the
backgammon counters.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He rode down the hill and then slowly along the ridge of the
Fell towards Peter's House. He had plenty of time to be at
Skiddaw House by four. It was a day in which everything seemed
restrained, as though the sun were longing to break out but was
held back by a strong hand. He passed an orchard where the pear
trees were a bright yellow, and then in the distance he saw how
the yellow hills were already autumnal, the heather resting on
them in a rosy shadow from place to place. He had always been
alive to beauty, although he resented it often because he felt
that it, like the rest of the world, mocked at any cripple; now
today the shadowed sun, the bright yellow of the leaves, the
distant hills, were all part of his own purpose. They knew what
would happen, and it was strange to him that they should all be
able to see ahead of him, certain of the event before it had
occurred.</p>

<p>'Everything is arranged then,' he thought. 'It is quite
settled what I shall do. Every past incident contributes to this.
I am what I have been made. And yet I could turn back if I
wished. I would cheat God if God there be. I am greater than God,
because now if I wished I could ride up Ireby Hill again and go
in quietly and play backgammon with my father.' He stayed his
horse for a moment, and had the fantastic thought that 'just to
show them' he would ride back. But he could not; of course, he
could not. Old 'Rogue' Herries; his father's words when he was
very little: 'Don't you hate that conceited young cousin of
yours, Uhland?'; Rodney's young son muttering 'Poor devil!' . . .
no, fragment after fragment had with infinite patience been
brought together, all that he might ride to Skiddaw House to meet
John Herries. And once again at the thought of that meeting his
blood was hot.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Jane Bellairs was the only one in the house to see John go.
She had two great devotions in her life--one for her
great-great-aunt Judith, the other for her uncle John. She
eliminated, as did her brothers and sisters, the degrees of
greatness from Judith, and called her quite simply (and very
proudly) 'my aunt'.</p>

<p>'But, dear, she cannot be your aunt,' tiresome Mrs Munberry in
Keswick had years ago said to her. 'She is far too elderly. You
mean great-aunt.'</p>

<p>But Jane had simply thought Mrs Munberry a foolish old witch,
with her grey hair and sharp eyebrows. For all the children
Judith was ageless. She had lived, of course, for ever, and would
live for ever. She was like God, only more easily loved. But
Uncle John was Jane's especial property. When he was absent in
London, Jane not only prayed for him night and morning but also
talked to him when she was alone, asked him whether she could
fetch him anything, and thought about him before she slept,
because she was certain that he was lonely. This idea that he
must be lonely had come to her at a very early age when, rocking
her doll by the fire in the parlour, she had looked up and seen
him staring out of window.</p>

<p>She had given him her doll to care for, and also, although he
did not perhaps know it, herself at the same time. The others
laughed at her for her devotion, especially Veronica, who was a
good hearty girl with no nonsense about her. But Jane did not
mind when they laughed. She had long grown accustomed to having
her own private life, a life that no one understood but Aunt
Judith. Her mother least of all, for Dorothy would perpetually be
saying: 'Dreaming again, Jane. Where's your work, child?' and
Jane would pick up her piece of worsted on which she was
embroidering a red rose or a ship with sails and, with a small
sigh that nobody heard, pricking her forefinger and biting her
lip, would set about it. She was, however, as Dorothy frequently
declared, the easiest of all the children, for when she lost her
temper she was quiet, not noisy like the others, and could amuse
herself quite happily all the day long. Although she was nearly
fourteen years of age now she was very slight and small.</p>

<p>'That child will never grow,' Dorothy exclaimed, and Judith
replied: 'My dear, don't be foolish. I'm eighty and have never
grown an inch since I was eight.'</p>

<p>And now she was the only one of all the family to see John go.
All morning she had been painting a picture. This was her
favourite pursuit, and here too the others laughed at her because
she did not paint easy things like cottages and cows and the sun,
very red with rays like wires, setting on a mountain, but things
much too difficult for her, like the Queen in her Palace, the
whale swallowing Jonah, and Noah seeing dry land. Yesterday on
her walk she had seen some horses drinking from a pond, and this
morning she had been drawing a great white horse swimming. Beyond
the pond there were mountains, and for some reason (she did not
know why) it was winter and the pond was black with ice. She
covered the pond with purple paint. This painting was to be for
John and, before dinner, she looked for him everywhere to give it
to him. She found him coming from the stable, leading his horse
Barnabas, and the small dog Mumps was with him. He smiled when he
saw the little girl in her pink bonnet. Her dress, with its
double skirt and fan-shaped corsage, made her quaint while on the
other children it seemed quite natural. It was as though she were
in fancy-dress.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Janey!' he said.</p>

<p>'Are you going to ride?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' He put his arm around her and kissed her.</p>

<p>'I've been up to Auntie's room and she's sleeping yet.'</p>

<p>Judith had not been well that morning and when she was not
well all the house was quieter. Jane considered him. Should she
show him her painting? He was busy because he was going
riding.</p>

<p>Yes, she would. She <i>must</i> show him.</p>

<p>'I've done a painting and it's for you.'</p>

<p>'Let's see.' He bent down, while Barnabas and Mumps stood
patiently waiting. All he saw was that some kind of animal was
sitting on a floor of purple paint. But he guessed that the
animal was a horse.</p>

<p>That's a grand horse,' he said, pinching her cheek.</p>

<p>'Yes, and it's swimming in a pond all frozen with ice, and
then it will ride up the mountain.'</p>

<p>'What a splendid horse! Is that for me?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>He kissed her and held her for a moment close to him. Then he
put the painting very carefully in his riding-coat pocket.</p>

<p>'Goodbye, my darling.'</p>

<p>'Where are you riding to?'</p>

<p>'Oh, only a little way.'</p>

<p>'Will you be back before I go to bed?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sweetheart.'</p>

<p>'Will you read <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>?'</p>

<p>'Yes, if there's time enough.'</p>

<p>She stood in the gateway waving to him until he was out of
sight. At the corner before the houses of the village hid him he
turned on his horse and waved back to her. She ran into the house
and wondered what there would be for dinner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When, beyond the village, he was riding by Langlands he
noticed an orchard and how yellow the leaves of the pear trees
were. That made his heart beat, and the thick grass under the
trees, the spikes of some of the sharper grasses, were already
brown at the tips. There had been frost every morning of late.
Then, as he turned towards Over Water, he realized that Mumps was
running most confidently at his side, his little black eyes
sparkling, his mouth open, stopping for quick snatched moments to
sniff at a smell, his whole person expressing extreme content and
happiness.</p>

<p>He must not have Mumps with him on this ride, so he pulled
Barnabas up and said sharply:</p>

<p>'Go home, Mumps! Go home!'</p>

<p>Mumps stopped and looked at him as though he had just received
the surprise of his life, as though he could not, in fact,
believe his ears.</p>

<p>'Go home, Mumps! I mean it.' And he flourished his whip.
Barnabas also exchanged a look with Mumps, saying: 'Yes. This is
genuine.'</p>

<p>Mumps ran forward, pretending that he had discovered so rich a
smell that John must be pleased, and being pleased, would soften
his heart. Then he stood, with one paw raised, intently
listening. Then when that was of no avail he sat down and
scratched his underparts. Then, that accomplished, he looked up
at John pleadingly. All of no value. The stern order was
repeated, so, after one more imploring stare, he surrendered and
slunk down the road, his tail between his legs. Round the bend,
he reconsidered the matter. He saw that his master was slowly
riding on, so, slowly, he followed, maintaining a tactful
distance.</p>

<p>When John had Over Water on his right and was approaching
Orthwaite Hall, he heard a bell ringing, the kind of bell that
rings from the belfry of a manor-house calling the servants to a
meal. It came beautifully through the honey-misted air. 'It is as
though,' he thought, 'some giant were holding back the sun.' Thin
patches of sunlight lay on the fields, and on the hills the
heather spread in clouds of rosy shadow. All was dim, and the
little sheet of water was like a buckler on whose surface someone
had been breathing, silver under cobweb, without bounds, raised
in air above the soil.</p>

<p>'It's funny,' he thought. 'Aunt Judith has always said that
she could see Over Water from the windows of the house. Of course
she could not. She must have the neck of a giraffe.' And yet he
himself had often thought that he saw Over Water from those
windows--a mirage. But how friendly a little piece of water it
was! All his life he had loved it--his whole life long.</p>

<p>Then, with a sharp stab of anticipation, he was aware of what
he was about. Somewhere already in this misty countryside Uhland
Herries was riding. They might meet on the way. He was somewhere
near, shadow behind shadow--and the bell, still ringing, echoed
in the air: 'This--Time--is--the--Last.
This--Time--is--the--Last.' He was conscious of an awful
temptation to turn back. Perspiration beaded his forehead. Why
should he go on--to his death maybe? This lovely land that all
his life he had adored; why should everything have been spoilt
for him so long by one person to whom he had never done any harm?
No. He must recognize that Uhland was only a symbol. Life would
have been for him always a place of fears and terrors even though
Uhland had never been born. What did the ordinary man--men like
Garth and Uncle Will and old James--know about such a life, know
how it was to wake in the night because you heard a sound, to
turn in the street and look back over your shoulder, to watch a
picture lest it should drop from the wall, to hear a mouse
scratch in the wainscot so that your heart thumped, to expect
with every post bad news, to fight, all your life long, shadows,
shadows, shadows? . . .</p>

<p>Oh, to be done with it, to throw fear out of your heart like a
dirty rag, and then perhaps he would be like Adam, so quiet and
sure, a little ironical about life but never afraid of it, with a
heart so unalarmed that it could spend itself on love of others.
He thought then that he heard a horse's hoofs knocking on the
road behind him, and he turned sharply. But there was no one. The
bell had ceased to ring. At last, today, it would be over. He
would settle with Uhland for ever. <i>That</i> fear at least
should be killed.</p>

<p>He rode on, past Peter's House, up on to the path across the
Fell leading to the road that climbed under Dead Crag up steeply
past Dash Waterfall. On his right were the Caldbeck Fells humped
against the sky and stained now with every colour, the rose and
purple of the heather, silver grey where the grass was thin, a
bright and burning green of fields between walls, and down the
side of one fell splashes of white quartz ran like spilt
milk.</p>

<p>He looked about him to see whether anywhere there was another
rider. He could see for a great distance now, to the right to the
sweep of the Bassenthwaite Woods, to the left where the dark
wine-stained sea of heather, grass and bare soil ran in a flood
to the feet of the Caldbeck Fells, breaking, as it began to
climb, into patches of field, a farm with a white wall, cows and
sheep grazing. But no human being moved in all the landscape.
Under Dead Crag, before he began to climb, he thought of the
ravens for which the Crag was famous. He looked up to where the
jagged edge cut the sky, and two birds, as though in answer to a
call, floated out like black leaves, circled silently in the
still air. The only sound was made by the Dash that tumbled with
fierce gestures from the height above. It was full and strong,
which was strange when there had been so little rain.</p>

<p>He was sorry that he had not been able to see Aunt Judith
before he left, and yet it was perhaps as well. She had sent down
word that she would like to see him in her room after her three
o'clock dinner, and of course he knew what it was that she
wanted--to persuade him at once to return to London. He wondered
what reason she would have given: something about Elizabeth, he
supposed, and at the thought of Elizabeth his heart seemed to
stop its beat. If he did not return from this ride . . . if he
did not return . . . Never to see her again . . . He climbed the
steep road.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Uhland reached Orthwaite Hall and looked across Over
Water the bell had ceased to ring. Then suddenly it began again,
softly, steadily, persistently: 'Going--going--gone . . .'</p>

<p>Uhland looked at the Tarn, and then turning to the hills saw a
thick tangle of mist like the ends of a woman's mantilla stray
loosely over the tops. If the mists were coming down that would
be serious. Many a man had been lost for hours between Calva and
Skiddaw when the mist fell. The House would be hard to find, and,
as though he had made a bet with some contestant, he was pledged
to reach the place by four. The sun that had been shining so
warmly when John half an hour before had been there, now was
withdrawing. The light still lay in patches on the fields and the
moor; down the Caldbeck Fells the shadow slipped, leaving the
glow bare behind it as the skirts of a woman might fall.</p>

<p>But Uhland was aware now of a great impatience. Nothing should
cheat him of this meeting. He longed to have John close to him,
to see him flinch, above all to put to the final test all that
those years and years of shadowing had anticipated. He urged on
his horse, hearing the bell follow him as he rode up towards Dead
Crag and the shining tumble of the Dash. He looked up at the
steep road that ran up under the Crag and saw three birds
circling like black leaves above the line of rock.</p>

<p>'Those must be ravens,' he thought, and remembered how, when
he was a very small child, he had heard men tell of the ravens
that haunted Dead Crag, and how, years ago, after the 'Forty-Five
Rebellion', they had flown above the corpses of men, crying and
calling in a vindictive triumph. He looked about him, down to the
Bassenthwaite Woods that were now black like iron, then across to
the sequence of fell-tops, but he could see no other rider.</p>

<p>'Is he behind me or before me?' he thought, and again that hot
excitement as of wine pouring through his body exalted him. He
felt a sort of grandeur that he had never known before. His
lameness did not handicap him now. He was as good as anyone, and
better, for he was on his way to dominate and conquer that
supercilious, disdainful fool whom he would have down on his
knees before the day was over.</p>

<p>But when he had almost reached the top of the road and the
waters of the Dash were loud in his ears, he saw that the mist
was beginning to pour like smoke from behind the hills. It came
in eddies and whirls of movement although there was no wind.
Greedily it ate up the farms, the fields, rose for a moment as
though beaten by the sun, then fell again. When he was actually
on the height he saw it advancing from every side. He pushed his
horse forward and a moment later felt its cold fingers on his
cheek. The whole world was blotted out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first thing that John heard when he started away from the
Dash was the eager, excited breathing of a dog. He looked back
and saw Mumps, his tongue out, happily racing towards him. The
dog knew that now there was nothing to be done. Too late now to
order him to go back. He felt a strange comfort as though this
were a sign from Fell House.</p>

<p>He was soon lost in the spaces of Skiddaw Forest. There was no
forest here; there had never perhaps been trees; the name was
used in the old Scottish hunting sense of a place for game. John
knew slightly General Sir Henry Wyndham whose land this was, and
his keeper Donald Grant, who lived at the House, his present
destination. The House was one of the loneliest dwelling-places
in all the British Isles, the only building from Threlkeld to
Dash. John knew also that, at this moment, Grant was in Scotland,
his family with him. He had heard only the week before that the
House was closed.</p>

<p>He could not anywhere in the whole world be more alone than he
now was. A chill, in contrast with the warm valley below, was in
the air, and the patches of heather, the sharp green of the grass
where the bilberries had been, the grey boulders, all had lost
the brilliance of their colour. He looked back once before he
went on and saw the Solway lit with a shaft of sunlight that
glittered and trembled under the line of Criffel and his
companions. He was leaving that shining world and with every step
of his horse was advancing into danger. On his right the flanks
of Skiddaw began to extend and he could see the cairn that marked
its peak against the sky. Calva was on his left. A moment later
he saw the bounds of his journey's end, on the right Lonskill
Crag, and on the left, extraordinarily black and angry, the sharp
line of Foul Crag, Blencathra's edge. Between them, far away, in
sunlight like the smile of another world, was the ridge of
Helvellyn. Sunlight behind him, sunlight before him, but his own
country dark, shadowed, without form, guarded by hostile crags.
He knew that under Lonskill was the House, and at the thought
that he was now so near to it a shudder that he could not control
took him. Soon he would come to the Caldew river, and, crossing
that, he would move into his fate, a fate that had been advancing
upon him since the day of his birth and before whose menace he
had been always helpless.</p>

<p>It was then that he noticed the mist. It came on the right
from Skiddaw, on the left from Calva. It tossed and rolled, crept
almost to his feet. Was Uhland in front of him or behind? And,
even as he asked himself, the whole world was blotted out.</p>

<center>
<h1>IN A DARK HOUSE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Uhland felt the wet mist close in he was conscious of an
almost desperate irritation. He was of so morbid and irritable a
temperament that he had always been unusually susceptible to
weather, to places, to trees and hills. He did not, as did John
and Adam, feel that this country was in any case beloved, that,
whatever it chose to do, it was to be accepted and welcomed as an
ally. It had seemed to him all his life bent on his frustration,
and, like others of his kind, he discounted lovely days but
recorded all the disappointments and, as they seemed to him, the
malignancies.</p>

<p>The fellow, he now contemptuously thought, would take this
mist as an excuse: 'I could not find the House. When the mist
came on I turned back'--and it seemed to Uhland that there would
never be an opportunity again. If he missed this he missed his
power over the man. He would hate him no longer but would
henceforth hate himself, and, more than that, be choked till he
died with this passion of which he could not rid himself.</p>

<p>He rode a little way and could not tell whether he were going
forward or back. He had been often in such mists before, but had
never been baffled and blinded as he now was, and, as always when
it was damp, his lame leg began to ache, as angry as he was at
this frustration.</p>

<p>He stopped to see whether he could hear the Caldew. It must be
somewhere near, but he had never in his life known such a silence
as had now fastened about him. The absence of any sound or
movement closed in upon his ears like the beat of a drum. He
moved on again, and as one often does in mist, thought that
someone was close behind him. It would be just like that fellow
to stab or shoot him in the back, an easy way once and for all to
rid himself of his enemy, and, although Uhland was not afraid, it
would be the last fitting irony of the injustice that he had all
his life suffered under to be stabbed in the dark and dropped
into space like carrion. He listened. Behind him something moved,
pebbles were displaced, or there was a soft crunching of the
grass.</p>

<p>'Herries, are you there?' he cried, and his own voice, the
voice that he had always despised and hated, came back clogged
with wet mist. 'Herries, are you there?'</p>

<p>The scene was fantastic, for at his feet and just in front of
him little fragments of ground were exposed, were closed, and
were exposed again. The mist immediately surrounding him was so
thick that it was like fog and so wetting that he was already
soaked through and through his clothes. It cleared at the top of
Calva, and the round shoulder of the hill sprang out like a live
thing on his left. It was so clear that he could see the patches
of bright green and bare boulders lit with a chill iridescence as
though in moonlight. Calva frowned at him, then raced under mist
again, leaving only a fragment like a bare arm lying nonchalantly
in space.</p>

<p>His horse struck pebbles, and then he heard the slow stealthy
murmur of the Caldew. Well, he was moving forward, for not far
beyond was the rising hill on which the House stood. Behind the
House was a wood, and if Wyndham's keeper should be at home they
could finish this affair among the trees. No one would see them
on such a day.</p>

<p>There should be a little wooden bridge over the Caldew. He
pulled in his horse, jumped off and peered around him. Now, if
John Herries was really behind him, would be the time for him to
come at him, and perhaps they would struggle there where they
stood and end it once and for all.</p>

<p>He spoke again: 'Now, Herries, I'm on foot . . . Are you
there?' There was no answer. If Herries <i>were</i> there he was
sitting motionless on his horse, and Uhland fancied that he could
<i>see</i> a horse there in the mist, and on it a gigantic
figure, motionless, waiting. He stumbled and almost fell over the
rocks into the stream. With an oath he pulled himself back and
began to find his way along the bank. Now he had lost the horse,
for the mist was around him like a wall, but the horse whinnied,
and at the same moment he discovered the wooden bridge. He went
back and led the horse safely across. Now he knew where he was,
for at once the ground began to rise. He came to a gate, opened
it, leading the horse through.</p>

<p>It was at this point that it was exactly as though someone
stood in his path. For a moment he <i>could</i> not move, and he
felt as though a great hand were pressed against his chest.</p>

<p>'Let me through, damn you,' he said, and stumbled and fell.
His lame leg often failed him, but now it was over a rock that he
had fallen. He had cut his hand, and his body pressed into the
wet soil, just as though someone were on his back holding him
down. The soil was filthy, soaking, deep in mire. His cheeks were
muddy and the knees of his breeches heavy with water. He pushed
backwards and was suddenly freed, as light as air, the mist
thinning so that, as he got on to his feet again, he saw the
House only a little way above him, swimming in air like a ship in
the sea. He moved forward, leading the horse, unlatched the gate,
passed through a small tangled garden of cabbages and currant
bushes. His feet grated on a gravel path, and he saw that in one
of the windows of the House a candle was shining.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Uhland's thought had not been far out. John, as the mist
enfolded him, had felt stir in him that weak boneless animal, so
long so hated a companion, who whimpered: 'Here is a way of
escape. You can say that you were lost, had to turn back.' He
stopped his horse and stayed there, listening and considering. At
once an odd memory came to him, odd because he had not thought of
it for years, and now it touched him as though there were
suddenly a warm, strong hand on his shoulder. He remembered how
once, when they were little children, Aunt Judith had told them a
story of their grandfather, David Herries; how he had run away
with their grandmother, years, years ago when she was a girl, and
fleeing with her from Wasdale up Stye Head had been pursued by an
uncle or someone of the kind--and then by the Tarn, in swirling
mist, Grandfather David and the uncle had fought while
Grandmother Herries watched, and Grandfather David had killed the
other. It had sounded then a grand story, like a story out of a
book, unrelated in any way to the warm fires and old armchairs of
Uldale. Now it was real. The mist that at this moment swirled
about him had swirled about David Herries then, and David Herries
had won. It was almost as though someone rode beside him, smiling
at him as they went. So then he rode forward, but nevertheless
the memory of an old story could not kill the struggle within
himself. 'Turn back! Turn back!' the boneless creature said. 'You
know that you are afraid. You know that when you are face to face
with him that old terror will be too strong for you, and at the
first word from that voice you'll run.'</p>

<p>And the other companion at his side seemed to whisper: 'Go on!
You have nothing to fear. All your life you have been fighting
shadows, and today at last you will discover what shadows they
have been.'</p>

<p>Yes, that was true. It had begun in his very babyhood when in
his cot he had seen how the reflections from the fire had made
fearful shapes on the wall. Then his nurse, old Mrs Ponder, how
he had shivered as he heard her heavy step on the stair, and her
voice as she said, 'Now, Mr John. I dare you to move!' and he had
stood, his heart thumping, transfixed; then the day when she had
thrown his rabbit out of window. The day, too, when he had first
seen Uhland, Uhland limping down the Keswick street, and that
pale face had turned towards him and something in him had bent
down and hidden away. The evening, too, when with Adam he had
seen Walter sitting his horse, silently, on the hill. But Walter
Herries had never meant much to him; the dread of his whole life
had been concentrated in Uhland, and it was of no use for others
to say, 'But this is phantasmal. There is no reality here.' For
his father, too, had found the real world a prison, and, year
after year, had allowed his mother to be mistress . . .</p>

<p>He threw up his head. 'I am revenging my father,' he thought,
'and my son, when he is born, will be fine if I am brave now.'
For he felt, as many men with imagination have done, that with
the vision they are given they can see that no men are apart,
that History has no Time, and that all souls struggle for victory
together.</p>

<p>So, greatly strengthened and as though suddenly he were seeing
his destiny for the first time, he pushed through the mist as
someone in a cellar pushes through wet cobwebs.</p>

<p>He now heard the running of the Caldew, and at the same moment
thought that Uhland was just behind him. He stopped Barnabas and
was aware of a multitude of noises. There was the murmur of the
stream, the thin breathing of the little dog, and, it seemed to
him, a multitude of whispering voices. Also dimly there sounded
music in the air. Since he was a boy he had known that hereabouts
was the place in Cumberland for finding the Musical
Stones--certain stones and boulders which, when cut, gave out
musical notes when you struck them. At the Museum in Keswick
there was a good set of these stones, and Mr Cunningham at
Caldbeck had a set on which he and his sons played many tunes.
They beat them with a leather-covered hammer. Often as children
Adam and he had come up to these parts and searched for them, and
he had once had a stone that gave out a great ringing sound like
an organ note. He had heard that in ancient days the Romans here
had used them in their houses for gongs. This memory came to him
now and pleased him. There was certainly some kind of music in
the air. He waited. Maybe Uhland was also there waiting, but it
was hard to see in the mist. If so this would be a good place to
end it.</p>

<p>At last he said out loud: 'Is anyone there?' and again, 'Who's
there?' But there was no answer.</p>

<p>He dismounted from Barnabas to find the wooden bridge across
the stream, and at once Mumps found it for him, going in front of
him and looking back to see whether he were following. After
that, it was easy to mount the rising ground, and soon, leading
Barnabas, he passed through the gate, along the little garden,
and up to the door of the House. The mist floated about the walls
in smoking wreaths. He could see dimly the wood. He found, as he
had expected, that the door was locked. There was no one there.
He went to the window on the right of the door and to his
surprise it was slightly open. Then he tied Barnabas to the
garden wall, pushed up the lower pane and easily vaulted into the
room. It was so dark that for a while he stood there accustoming
his eyes to it, and the mist poured in through the open window as
though all the outer world were on fire. After a time he stumbled
about, knocking his knees against a chair and the edge of a
table. He found the fireplace, and on the mantel his hand closed
on a candle. He struck a match from a box in his inner pocket and
lit it. He waited, listening. He opened the door and went into
the passage.</p>

<p>'Is anyone in the house?' he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer. He heard some hens running. Then he went
back into the room, and almost immediately after there were steps
on the pebble path outside.</p>

<p>Standing back against the mantel he heard the steps go to the
door, he heard the lock shaken, then back to the window, a pause,
and Uhland had climbed into the room.</p>

<p>As they faced one another the room at once became of great
importance, and when Uhland closed the window behind him the
candle, that had been blowing wildly, steadied itself and seemed
to watch thereafter with a piercing eye. There was very little in
the room. A deal table, and on it a bright green mat and some
pallid wax fruit under a dusty glass cover. On the mantelpiece
were two large china dogs with bright red spots like a rash on
their bodies, a clock that pointed to five minutes to four
although it was not going. In the corner there was a grandfather
clock that leaned forward drunkenly, on the walls a large
highly-coloured print of the opening of the Great Exhibition and
an engraving of the Duke of Wellington covered with yellow
damp-spots. There was a wheel-back armchair with a patchwork
cushion and in the corner a child's rocking-horse. In another
corner there was a spinning-wheel. The floor was of brick. In the
window there was a dead plant in a pot.</p>

<p>Uhland set his gun against the wall and sat down. His leg hurt
him confoundedly. He rested his arms on the table, and stared at
John. As he looked he was reassured. He had thought that perhaps
now when they met at last he would find that there was nothing to
be done, nothing to be said. All this chase and pursuit for so
long had been a chimera. He would not be rid of the mad
impatience and restlessness in his heart by any contact with this
poor fool. He would just look at him contemptuously and let him
go. But it was not so. The very sight of John started his rage.
John had taken off his riding-coat. He wore a narrow blue tie
over which his shirt collar was folded, and his shirt had an
inset-breast of the finest linen. He wore a waistcoat of dark
blue patterned with tiny dark red flowers. He was not a dandy,
but everything about him was exquisitely clean and well-fitting.
His features, pale, keen, sensitive, gave him an air of great
aloofness and high breeding without, however, any conceit or
arrogance, and he seemed, in some way, in spite of his years,
still a boy--for his figure was slim as a boy's and his air as
delicate and untouched by life as a boy's of seventeen might
be.</p>

<p>Uhland knew that he himself was muddied, wet, and that his
hand was stained with blood. There was mud on his cheek. Yes, he
would spoil some of that beauty and aloofness before he left that
house, and once again the blood began to beat, hot and insistent,
in his veins.</p>

<p>He tapped with his fingers on the bare table.</p>

<p>'I'm here,' he said. 'What do you want to say?'</p>

<p>'I want to say this.' John found to his disgust that his hands
were trembling. He held them tight against his sides. 'I want to
ask you a question. Why for years now have you followed me--in
London, here in Cumberland--everywhere? I have never done you any
harm that I know.'</p>

<p>'I fancy,' said Uhland, 'that I may go where I please. Who
says that I have been following you?'</p>

<p>'You know that you have, and that you have done it because it
offends me. It must cease from now on.'</p>

<p>Uhland paused. Then he repeated softly: 'It must cease . . .
But why?'</p>

<p>'Because I say that it must.'</p>

<p>'You talk like a schoolboy,' Uhland replied. 'We are grown
men. Of course I go where I please and do what I please. You are
a coward, you know. You are the son of a coward, you were born a
coward, you will be a coward until you die. Otherwise you would
have faced up to me years ago.'</p>

<p>'No,' said John. 'I could not because you are a cripple.'</p>

<p>At that word Uhland's fingers ceased to beat on the table. A
little shiver ran through his body.</p>

<p>'That makes a good excuse for you,' he said at last quietly.
'Now listen to me for a moment. It is quite true that I have
always hated you. Your family is a disgrace. Your father allowed
your mother to be a man's mistress for many years. I daresay the
fellow paid him to keep quiet. Then your father was challenged to
a duel and ran away. Then, because there was nothing else for him
to do, he shot himself in London. Well, it has not been nice for
the rest of us to have such relations at our very gates. It was
very painful for my father. From the very first you gave yourself
airs, you mocked at my lameness, you spread scandal about my
father's manner of life. You were always--although you did
nothing but walk about Keswick in your grand clothes--a vain
fool. The very sight of you was an irritation, but an irritation
that pleased me because you were, and are, so miserable a coward
that a very look from me made you quake. And then you had the
damned impertinence to marry my sister.'</p>

<p>'We will leave her out of this,' John said.</p>

<p>'Oh no, we will not. That is a score that I have been waiting
a long while to pay . . . Why, look!' he suddenly cried, with a
mocking laugh. 'You are shaking now!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' John said, and he drew a little kitchen chair to the
table and sat down. 'I will sit down. I am trembling, as you say,
but that is because you always affect me so. A sort of disgust
that I cannot control.'</p>

<p>But, as he spoke, he knew that it was more than disgust, it
was fear from the disgust. Now if ever was the moment to which
all his life had led. If he failed now, everything would be
lost--his father, Elizabeth, their child. And he did not know
that it would not be lost, for something within him--the traitor
to himself that had been born with him--was urging him to run.
'Run! Run! Climb out of that window and run for your life.' His
limbs were moving with a power that was not his own at all. He
had to hold his feet against the brick floor. The fight within
himself was so arduous that he could scarcely think of, or even
see, Uhland. It was something more than Uhland, and something
worse.</p>

<p>'If I move I'm lost,' he thought. He fixed his eyes on the
pallid, deathly wax fruit. He fixed his eyes but he could not fix
his heart. Ah, if only he could rise and throw himself on Uhland,
that would be an escape as well as the other, but the man was a
cripple, a damned cripple--</p>

<p>'I see,' said Uhland. 'I fill you with disgust. But it's
yourself you're disgusted with. Because I found you out years
ago. You've cheated the others, who think you a mighty fine
fellow. I've shown you to yourself. Every time that I've been
near you you've felt what you are. You have at least the grace to
be ashamed . . .'</p>

<p>Then an odd thing occurred. Uhland stretched one of his arms
out along the table, and his hand lay there, almost under John's
eyes. It was a lean white hand, the knuckles red, and on the back
of it thin hairs faintly yellow. The nails were long and dead.
The hand seemed to John to curve and twist on the table, like a
thing in a nightmare, and, when it was close to him, he was
suddenly strengthened. Was it that hand that he had always been
fearing? Was this the ghost? Was this all? His eyes cleared. The
room was formed and plain. The spinning-wheel was real, the Duke
looked at him with grave, stern eyes. His legs were no longer
trembling.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said in a clear strong voice that had no quaver,
'whatever the past has been, I am afraid of you no longer. You
should have done more with your life than to spend it over one
man, in especial if he's the poor creature you think me. I am
afraid of you no more, so you can follow me no more. Nor shall
you insult my father and mother again. You may be lame or not
lame. After those insults your lameness is of no account, and
before we leave this house you are down on your knees--on your
knees. When you please. Choose your time. We can be here all
night if you wish.'</p>

<p>Would his courage last? Was this a true lasting thing that he
felt? For the first time he looked Uhland straight in the
face.</p>

<p>Uhland withdrew his hand. He now was trembling, but with
anger, the choking wild anger that so constantly came to him from
the sense of his own ostracism. It was as though, at John's
repeated 'lameness', all the world laughed, and a little crowd of
sympathizers inside himself massed together and begged him to
avenge them.</p>

<p>'You coward!' he cried in that odd shrill voice that should
have been, if fate had been fair, rich, deep and generous. 'Why,
you are afraid of your own shadow! You shall stay here--do you
hear?--and you shall not move! Stay there without moving until I
bid you, and then it is you who shall be on your knees, and beg
and pray, and beg--' He half rose, leaning forward on his arms,
his thin muddied face staring into John's.</p>

<p>And John could not move. He would have risen and he could not.
Something within him was melting, loosening . . . in another
moment it would be too late for ever.</p>

<p>It seemed that an hour passed. It was only a moment. Then, his
head bent as though he were putting forth all his strength, at
the instant when his power seemed gone, he pushed over the
table.</p>

<p>It fell with a crash, the wax fruit with it, and the glass
shattering on the brick floor.</p>

<p>His eyes shining, he stood back to the wall. He would not
touch the man! He would not touch the man! But all fear was gone.
He was strong with his whole strength--</p>

<p>'Come on, Uhland. Down!' he cried, laughing. 'I won't touch
you. On your knees and then off with you. Back home--'</p>

<p>He saw Uhland stand. He marked every part of him, his hair
thin on the top, the mud on his cheek, his damp stock, the round
buttons of his coat. He saw Uhland take his gun from the wall. He
thought, 'Elizabeth!' Uhland fired.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the noise the little dog on the path outside began to bark.
He barked running up and down outside the closed door. Then he
began to whimper, again and again scratching at the door. The
room was filled with smoke and mist. Slowly it cleared. Uhland
stood for a long while with the gun in his hand, but at last he
leant it carefully against the wall and went over to the empty
fireplace. He bent down and looked at the body. John lay there,
his face hidden in his arm. Very gently Uhland turned him over,
unfastened his waistcoat, felt for his heart. John was dead.</p>

<p>'Well, that is the end,' he thought.</p>

<p>He felt no relief; only an increased grudge of injustice. He
felt sick, too, with that accustomed nausea that had so often
attacked him. He sat in the wheel-back chair, licking his dry
lips with his tongue. The whole aim of his life was gone, and
what it had been he had now no idea. He was sorry for no one but
himself, and even about himself he felt now a bitter, savage
irony. All those days and years for nothing. He had had a right
to be in a rage, but how purposeless rage was! He was the victim
of the grossest injustice, but what a poor, muddy, shabby victim!
He felt an especial rage with his nausea. To be sick now would be
the last indignity. But he would not be sick. At least he could
prevent that. And this was all the long pursuit had come to . . .
nothing . . . sickness . . . and his hand was bleeding again. He
looked about the room. He knew what he wanted. A piece of paper.
He got up and limped here and there, almost stumbling once over
John's body. There was no paper anywhere, and why to God was that
dog outside whimpering? He blundered against the clock, and it
lurched as though it tapped him on the shoulder. No paper
anywhere. He knelt down, with difficulty, because his knees were
stiff. Then he got up again. No, he would try first the
riding-coat. In the inside pocket he found a paper and drew it
out. It was once folded. What the devil was this? a crude
painting, a sea of purple and some animal, a horse, a cow. But
the reverse side was blank.</p>

<p>He sat down at the table and, taking a pencil from his pocket,
wrote:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To all whom it may concern.</p>

<p>This is to say that John Herries of Fell House, Uldale, and I,
Uhland Herries of High Ireby, met here at Skiddaw House by
appointment. After a discussion we quarrelled, and I shot John
Herries, he being undefended. After, I shot myself.</p>

<p align="RIGHT">Uhland Herries.</p>

<p><i>September 23rd, 1854</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He laid the paper on the table, then unfastened his stock and
laid that beside it.</p>

<p>He went to his gun, loaded it, placed the muzzle inside his
mouth and fired.</p>

<p>'Eighty-five! Is she, by God!' said Captain O'Brien, putting
up his eyeglass.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Veronica, smiling. 'But you mustn't swear. You
swear dreadfully, Captain O'Brien, and I don't think it's at all
nice.'</p>

<p>'Do I, by God?' said the Captain. 'I mean to say, Miss
Veronica, I'd no idea . . . 'pon my soul, I must get a hold on
myself. Is it our turn? Damn the game! Always getting in the way
. . . What I mean to say--'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose it is our turn. What do you think, Captain
O'Brien? Shall we have war with France? Louis Napoleon is
<i>very</i> dangerous, isn't he? But of course we've got the
Volunteers.'</p>

<p>'Ho! the Volunteers!' shouted the Captain in derision. 'The
Volunteers! That's good. Damned useful they'll be. But I tell you
what, Miss Veronica.' But it <i>was</i> his turn. Amabel, who was
playing (most reluctantly) with the Reverend Mr Hall, a bony,
black-bearded clergyman from Penrith, had missed her hoop.</p>

<p>The occasion was a garden-party given by 'Madame' to her
friends and neighbours on an afternoon of the summer of '59. Most
fortunately it was a lovely day--fortunate because in August you
never could be sure, the most treacherous month of the year in
these districts. But today was lovely indeed, as Mrs O'Brien said
over and over to anyone who would listen to her. 'Most lovely!
Most fortunate! Who would have supposed? And such a lovely
garden!'</p>

<p>The old house was gentle and benign under the small ivory
clouds that floated in shreds and patches on the summer sky. The
lawn was a smooth stainless green. The part of it that spread
under the cherry-coloured wall had been laid out for croquet.
Near the Gothic temple a tent had been set up for tea; the
servants were coming backwards and forwards from the house.</p>

<p>Chairs were arranged under the wing of the house near the
croquet-lawn, and in the shade of the trees by the Temple there
were more chairs, two or three, placed beside Madame's. To these,
people were led up in turns to talk to her--'Not for too long,
you understand,' Dorothy explained. 'So as not to tire her, you
know. But she enjoys everything. She was never better in her
life. Yes, eighty-four last Christmas. Most extraordinary! But
she has always enjoyed the best of health! She does delight in a
talk! Everything interests her!'</p>

<p>'A very pretty scene!' Judith thought happily. Although she
was in the shade, the sun warmed her through the trees. She was
wearing the black dress with the white lace at her throat and
wrists that had been for so many years now her costume, but
around her shoulders was the beautiful Cashmere shawl that Adam
had given to her last Christmas, a shawl light, soft and bright,
embroidered in silk with a heavy knotted silk fringe at its edge.
On her head she wore a cap of white lace and, every once and
again, she held over her head a black parasol. Against her chair
rested her famous cane. Her face now had the pallor of ivory, but
the cheeks were stouter than they used to be. Her eyes shone with
a startling brilliance. She missed nothing. On her breast she
wore a locket that contained Adam's picture. 'A very pretty
scene!' but nevertheless she thought the crinolines ridiculous.
They were not, perhaps, quite so absurd for young girls like
Veronica and Jane, but Dorothy now! Yes, Dorothy was monstrous.
She was a woman of fifty-one and had grown very stout. Her
crinoline was vast and very heavy. It was of Chinese gauze and
had twelve flounces. Her sleeves also had many flounces, and they
looked as though a number of horns had been stuck one within
another. Her bertha had ruches, embroideries in profusion, and
she wore on her shoulders a Scottish plaid which the Empress
Eug&eacute;nie had made the fashion after her visit to her
maternal home. A graceful woman might do something with all
this--but a woman of Dorothy's figure! And when she moved in the
house all the furniture was in constant peril!</p>

<p>The girls were pretty; at any rate Veronica in white, with her
bonnet far back on her head, showing her really beautiful dark
hair almost to the crown; and darling Jane, so fair, so slender,
although no one thought her pretty in comparison with Veronica,
was, in Judith's eyes, bewitching.</p>

<p>As the figures moved across the lawn, in their wide swinging
dresses, white, rose and blue, the sun shining down so
benevolently, no sounds save the click of the mallets and the
balls, the murmur of voices, the clink of the china as the
servants (Lucy and Emily--<i>such</i> good girls) arranged the
tea, Judith felt a deep, satisfying content. The only thing was
that Margaret was not so well. Her child was due very soon now,
but Doctor Bettany said not for a week, he thought. But she had
not been well this morning. Adam was anxious. Strange to have,
after all these years of marriage, their first child! And
Margaret was not so young any longer.</p>

<p>Ah, here was that tiresome, silly Mrs Osmaston. Mrs Osmaston
was thin, withered and weary. She had had so many children that
nothing remained of her but a bone or two, a nervous cough and an
interest in gossip. She was neither kind nor unkind, discreet nor
indiscreet. The only two facts certain about her were--one, that
she had been a mother many many times, and two, that she was
exceedingly stupid. She was afraid of Judith, who, she was sure,
mocked at her when her back was turned. No one in the world ought
to be both so old and so vigorous. There she was, a magazine on
her lap, and she had been reading without glasses.</p>

<p>'Oh, what is it you have been reading, dear Madame Paris?' Mrs
Osmaston asked, seating herself with care in the garden chair.
Her crinoline was of the latest fashion, that is, its steel hoops
were lowered so that they did not begin immediately below the
bodice but only at the knees, and in this way the dress fitted
under the hips and only began to grow wider below the knees. This
scarcely suited Mrs Osmaston's thin figure, but she was very
proud of it and thought herself smarter than any other woman
present. And <i>what</i> she thought of Dorothy Bellairs! Oh, but
she would entertain the family circle when she arrived home this
evening! (She could not see, fortunately, the Shade of her
great-grandmother-in-law, who, a swearing, horsy, good-natured
Ghost, looked out from the Gothic Temple, remembering how she
once had drunk tea on this very lawn, and wondered, in her hearty
indecent fashion, at this ridiculous Ghost of a
descendant-in-law.)</p>

<p>'Yes, what is it you have been reading, dear Madame
Paris?'</p>

<p>'Interesting,' said Judith, picking up the <i>Quarterly
Review.</i> 'There are some comments on Mr Tennyson's <i>Idylls
of the King</i>.' She read: '<i>The chastity and moral elevation
of this volume, its essential and profound though not didactic
Christianity, are such as perhaps cannot be matched throughout
the circle of English literature in conjunction with an equal
power.</i>' She paused and gave Mrs Osmaston a sharp look. Then
she continued, a little lower down:</p>

<p>'<i>He has had to tread upon ground which must have been
slippery for any foot but his. We are far from knowing that
either Lancelot or Guinevere would have been safe even for mature
readers, were it not for the instinctive purity of his mind and
the high skill of his management . . .</i>'</p>

<p>Judith looked Mrs Osmaston full in the face and casting the
<i>Quarterly</i> upon the grass, repeated: 'Chastity and moral
elevation! Stuff! Did you ever hear such humbug and hypocritical
nonsense, Mrs Osmaston?'</p>

<p>Mrs Osmaston, who had just been preparing to say that she
thought it one of the most beautiful critical utterances she had
ever listened to, sent her Adam's apple up and down in so swift a
necessity for reversal of judgement. She gasped like a fish
suddenly raised from the water.</p>

<p>'Oh yes . . . indeed, yes . . . very absurd. I have not yet
read Mr Tennyson's <i>Idylls.</i></p>

<p>Judith wished that she had not been so impulsive. The last
thing that she wished was to make Mrs Osmaston unhappy. The older
she grew the greater need she saw in the world for general
kindness and charity, and the harder she found it to suffer fools
gladly. That was why life was always difficult, amusing and
exciting.</p>

<p>She knew that now, simply because of this little incident, Mrs
Osmaston would go away and talk, like a hen scratching in a
backyard. Judith could hear her. 'Not softened in the least by
that awful tragedy of five years ago. You would have thought that
such a <i>terrible</i> thing . . .'</p>

<p>Not softened! Judith's heart and gaze left the garden and the
figures moving across the lawn, and she was caught up again, as
she so constantly was, into that dreadful afternoon and evening .
. . Yes, five years ago . . . when, lying in bed, she had heard
first that John had ridden out, no one knew whither, and how
then, with a frightened pathetic foreboding, she had lain there
listening to every sound, and at last she could bear it no longer
but had got up and come downstairs. And she and Dorothy had sat
there, waiting, listening. Then the opening of the gate, the rap
on the door, the news that his body was outside . . .</p>

<p>And after that, old though she was, she had held everything
together. There had been a wild, mad, hysterical letter from
Walter; Elizabeth had come, a lovely fragile ghost, and in
February of the next year had borne a boy, here at Fell House,
whom she had named Benjamin. There had been Jane, too, who for a
while had seemed to be mentally unsettled. The poor child had
fancied that there was something that she might have done, might
have held him there, prevented him from riding . . .</p>

<p>The excitement in the neighbourhood had gone on and on and on
. . . It was only, they all said, what they might have expected.
There had always been a strain of madness in the Herries. Didn't
old Herries in the eighteenth century sell his mistress at a
Fair, kill his first wife with unkindness, and marry a gipsy for
his second? Hadn't Madame always been crazy, clever though she
was? And all the sorry, stale business of Francis and Jennifer
came up again, over and over, and then all the drunkenness and
evil living at the Fortress, and Uhland of course was
mad--everyone knew--but to shoot his cousin who was defenceless,
there on Skiddaw, miles from anywhere--and the little dog had
been whimpering like a human being when they found the
bodies.</p>

<p>But somehow, by sheer strength of personality, Judith had
dominated it all and beaten it down. Now at last the full value
and force of her character was seen. For one thing so many of
them liked her. She had done so many kindnesses, she was no
respecter of persons, the same to one as to another, and yet she
was dignified and commanding. She was the more commanding in that
she no longer went about, and only visitors to the house saw her,
and not many of <i>them.</i> But when they had visited her they
always returned home with wonderful stories. Everyone obeyed her
as though she were a General in an army, and yet everyone loved
her. She thought of everyone and everything, and yet could rap
you over the knuckles with a sharp word. She didn't care who it
was that she rapped. The whole County was proud of her, admired
her, talked of her without end, told every sort of tale about
her. She was a legend.</p>

<p>And here was Adam coming towards them! She knew everything
that was passing through his mind. She saw his quick glance at
Mrs Osmaston, his loving look at herself. She smiled back, saying
at the same time: 'Well, to my mind there's far too much nowadays
of making small children feel that they're born in sin. Do not
you think so, Mrs Osmaston?' She liked the beard that he had
grown in the last year. It suited him; he looked well, solid and
muscular, not stout as she had once feared that he would be. How
dearly she loved the half-humorous half-cynical brightness of his
eyes. He suffered fools no more gladly than she--in fact, she
thought comfortably, they grew more like one another every day.
But she could not persuade him to wear his party clothes. He
would wear his sack coat and round hard hat, and the checks of
his trousers were so <i>very</i> pronounced. All his clothes hung
about him loosely, and there was Captain O'Brien with his great
moustaches and tightly fitting fawn trousers so <i>extremely</i>
elegant. She did hope that Veronica would not fall in love with
him nor with young Mr Eustace, the curate, who with his fluffy
hair and surprised gaze resembled a chicken just out of the
egg!</p>

<p>'How do you do, Mr Paris?' said Mrs Osmaston a little stiffly;
she was no more comfortable with the son than she was with the
mother. And why did he wear such very ill-fitting clothes? He
also wrote for the London magazines, which made him very
dangerous, for you never knew that he might not put you into
something!</p>

<p>Adam sat very close to his mother, his big square body
protecting her tiny one. He exchanged, in a whisper, one quick
word with her.</p>

<p>'I have just been in to see Margaret, Mother. She really is
not so well. Do you think that I should send James for Bettany?
He is over at Greystoke, you know.'</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, I should. Just as well.'</p>

<p>Adam bowed to Mrs Osmaston (sarcastically, she felt) and
strode towards the house.</p>

<p>Ah, now, Judith thought, they are moving to the tent for tea.
She had an impulse of impatience to run across the lawn that she
might see that everything was right. But of course she could run
no longer. But Lucy was a <i>good</i> girl and Dorothy had sense.
And one good thing--she could now rid herself of Mrs
Osmaston.</p>

<p>'Tea, Mrs Osmaston,' she said. 'I see they are going to the
tent for tea. Mr Hattick,' she cried, her voice wonderfully sweet
and clear, 'will you take Mrs Osmaston to tea?'</p>

<p>Mr Hattick was a stout red-faced manufacturer from Birmingham
who had bought a place on Bassenthwaite Lake, a very common man.
The County was still undecided whether to cut him or no, but he
had been kind to Judith and presented Timothy with a fine bay,
and if he was kind that was enough. And now it would be good for
Mrs Osmaston that she should be taken into tea by Mr Hattick.</p>

<p>She was watching them moving across the lawn with much
amusement when an awful thing occurred. Amabel suddenly appeared,
and in her voice were the notes of excited surprise and exceeding
pleasure.</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt Judith--what do you think? Miss Martineau has
come!'</p>

<p>Harriet Martineau! Of all appalling things! And now, when she
was already a little tired and was thinking that she would go in
presently and see how Margaret was . . .</p>

<p>Alas, Judith did not care for Miss Martineau, and had often
congratulated herself that Ambleside was far distant from Uldale.
She recognized that she was exceedingly wise, immensely learned,
and possibly the greatest woman now alive in England, but Judith
did not care for so much learning. She had never herself had much
education, she was not a Positivist, she detested the thought of
mesmerism, and she envied the way in which Miss Martineau milked
her own cows and ploughed her own fields. Moreover, Miss
Martineau never ceased to talk--about Comte, about America, about
her marvellous Cure, about her weak heart, about her pigs and
cows, about her novels (Judith thought <i>Deerbrook</i> a very
silly book), about Mr Atkinson, about her <i>Guide to the
Lakes.</i> Miss Martineau spoke always of the Lakes as though
they were her own creation and would not have existed had it not
been for her. She <i>patronized</i> the Lakes. In addition
Harriet was all for women taking man's place; Judith did not see
how they could possibly do so. They were very nice as they were:
pretty Veronica twining Captain O'Brien around her little finger,
and Margaret indoors about to present the world with a dear
little baby. Harriet wanted women 'to rise up and take their
proper place in the world'. As though, Judith thought
indignantly, they had not their proper place already. And this
was all very bad for Amabel, who said that she did not care for
men and would like to be in Parliament. In Parliament! Women in
Parliament! You might as well make doctors of them. Amabel adored
Harriet Martineau, and was always hoping that she would be
invited to stay at the Knoll.</p>

<p>But worst of all was Harriet's trumpet. Judith had, in spite
of herself, a little scorn for deaf people because her own
hearing was so extremely good. But a trumpet! . . . And Miss
Martineau was so proud of it. Moreover, in a most irritating
fashion, she would remove it in the middle of one of Judith's
sentences. Malicious people said that she always did that if she
thought that something was coming that she did not wish to hear.
However, here she was--in no time at all she was striding towards
them. 'Is it a woman or a man,' an old lady once said of her to
William Howitt, 'or what sort of animal is it? said I to myself;
there she came--stride, stride, stride--great heavy shoes, stout
leather leggings on, and a knapsack on her back--they say she
mows her own grass, and digs her own cabbages and taturs!'</p>

<p>She was decently enough dressed today, with no ridiculous
crinoline (that is in her favour, thought Judith), large boots
certainly, and a thing like a Scotsman's bonnet on her head, and
one of the fashionable Scottish plaids over her shoulders. In her
right hand she held her trumpet; Amabel, listening to her every
word, was beside her, and Adam, coming from the house, was not
far behind.</p>

<p>'Well, well, well, Madame Paris, and how are you? I have been
for the night in Caldbeck and am to be this evening in Keswick. I
am giving an address on Domestic Economy as you have doubtless
seen by the papers. And I have brought you my <i>Letters on the
Laws of Man's Nature and Development.</i> It was published as far
back as '51, you know, but Mrs Leeds told me that she was sure
that you had not read it, and I thought that I would have your
opinion. And here are some peaches straight from my garden. I
said to myself, "Madame Paris shall have those peaches because
she is a woman I admire. She should have been a man and
represented us in Parliament."'</p>

<p>'Indeed I should not,' Judith answered indignantly, and then
discovering that she was speaking into the air when she should
have spoken into the trumpet, seized that instrument and shouted
down into it: 'Indeed I would not have been a man for any
money!'</p>

<p>'Would you not?' said Miss Martineau complacently and with a
look of kindness at the old lady (for she liked those bright eyes
and that independence, for she was as good-hearted and free of
meanness as she was egoistic and free of sensitiveness). 'Well, I
had no notion that you had a party.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Judith, catching the trumpet again. 'They are in
the tent having tea. You had better go and have some.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I will not,' said Harriet, laughing. 'I have come to
see <i>you</i> and I cannot stop more than a moment. My
enlargement of the heart, you know, forbids me to stay long on a
visit. Old Colonel Albany in Keswick insists on a talk. He says
that he has several criticisms to make on my <i>Suggestions for
the Future Government of India.</i> Criticism indeed! I shall
like to hear what he has to say. All these old Colonels are the
same. It has needed a woman to tell them the truth about their
own affairs.' She kicked one leg in front of her and thrust her
trumpet almost into Judith's eye.</p>

<p>'Now tell me what <i>you</i> think about India.'</p>

<p>'I, my dear?' Judith shook her head. 'Why, I have no thoughts
about anything. I live in the past and not the sort of past that
interests <i>you</i>, Miss Martineau. My past is all
pin-cushions, lavender-water and parasols. I assure you there was
never anyone with less opinions.'</p>

<p>'Don't you believe her, Miss Martineau,' said Adam, laughing.
'She is a mountain of opinions. There never was anyone with so
many.'</p>

<p>But Miss Martineau had caught only the word 'mountain'.</p>

<p>'Mountain! That's what I said to Coleridge once--'</p>

<p>'Ah, you knew Coleridge,' Adam said eagerly. She caught that
and it pleased her.</p>

<p>'Yes. I talked to him only once. Not that I can say that his
career is anything but a warning. All that transcendental
conversation, you know, was all nonsense. Nothing but
nonsense--'</p>

<p>'Yes, but,' Adam shouted down the trumpet, 'what was he like?
Tell us what he was like.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very fine--a perfect picture of an old poet. Neatly
dressed in black as I remember, with perfectly white hair. And
what I especially recollect was his underlip that quivered with a
very touching expression of weakness--very touching indeed. The
face was neither thin nor pale as I remember it, but the eyes!
No, I must declare, although in my opinion his poetry will not be
remembered and as to his philosophy--I cannot express the scorn I
have for his philosophy--but I never <i>saw</i> such eyes. The
<i>glitter</i>! The amazing <i>glitter</i>, and shining so that
one was nearly afraid to look at them! All the same, the glitter
was only opium, you know, nothing but opium.'</p>

<p>'The father of my little Hartley,' Judith thought, smiling to
herself--and in some strange way now, at this moment, while the
late afternoon sun threw long purple shadows over the grass, and,
behind the temple, the trees, whose leaves were tenderly touched
with orange, massed like a solid cloud against the line of faint
and silver hills, the thick dreaming figure of the poet seemed to
wander towards them across the lawn.</p>

<p>The girls, moving like dancers, came smiling from the tent. In
the clear still air the rich unctuous voice of the Reverend Mr
Hall could be heard saying: 'Ah, but, Miss Bellairs, you
misunderstand me. It is against the rule of my cloth to have a
bet with you, but nevertheless . . .'</p>

<p>'Mr Coleridge! Mr Coleridge!' Adam could have cried. 'Come and
sit with us and we will assure you that your poetry will never
die!'</p>

<p>But Miss Martineau must be moving on. She was pleased that
that sensible-looking child (Amabel) gazed at her with such
evident devotion. Maybe she would invite her to stay at the
Knoll. Her heart was warm and kind, and it was not <i>her</i>
fault that she knew such a terrible deal about so many very
different things. But, as she wished goodbye to Judith, she
thought: 'I should like to become an old lady like that.' Then
she stamped away to her carriage.</p>

<p>She was hardly gone when Will Leathwaite appeared and,
standing solidly and quietly beside Adam, said: 'The doctor is
come, Mr Adam.'</p>

<p>'I'll be with you,' said Judith.</p>

<p>He gave her his arm. Veronica came running towards them.</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith, can I help you?'</p>

<p>'No, my dear, thank you. It is growing chilly for me. You must
be hostess, Veronica, my dear.'</p>

<p>They went into the house together, she leaning on Adam's arm,
Will Leathwaite following them like a bodyguard. It was splendid
to have Leathwaite: he was as obstinate as he was devoted, as
scornful of what he did not understand as he was faithful to all
that he loved. He loved Adam and all that Adam comprehended, but
only <i>because</i> Adam comprehended.</p>

<p>'Will tolerates me,' Judith said to Adam, laughing.</p>

<p>'Will loves you.'</p>

<p>'Only because I'm your mother.'</p>

<p>'And what better reason could he have, pray?'</p>

<p>Stopping for a moment in the hall she said: 'Ah, there are
Harriet's peaches and her book. I shall eat the peaches and not
read the book. She's a kind soul, but I never wish to listen to
what <i>she</i> wishes to tell me. Adam, I'm weary and shall go
to bed.'</p>

<p>It was then that, looking up, they saw the doctor coming down
the stairs towards them, and in that one glance the world was
changed for both of them. Gone were Miss Martineau's book and
peaches, crinolines swaying in the sunshine, pleasant lawns and
rose-coloured garden walls. Adam jumped to the stairs and caught
the doctor's arm.</p>

<p>'Bettany, what is it?'</p>

<p>'Labour has begun,' Bettany said gravely.</p>

<p>'Well, well?'</p>

<p>'It will be difficult. You can do nothing, Paris. Best stay
down here.'</p>

<p>But Judith at once took charge.</p>

<p>'Yes, Adam. Wait in the parlour. All will be perfectly well. I
am sure of it. Remember Margaret is a strong woman. There, there,
Adam.' She leaned up to him and kissed his cheek. 'Don't be
nervous. There is nothing that you can do. Women understand these
things. Come with me, Doctor. Is there anything further you
require?'</p>

<p>Then there came to all of them a sound from above, half-moan,
half-cry. It seemed to break the silence, the indifference of the
house as a rough hand tears tissue paper.</p>

<p>'Oh, my God!' Adam whispered.</p>

<p>But they were gone. He was alone. He summoned all his
fortitude and turned with firm step to the parlour. Will
Leathwaite was standing by the hall door.</p>

<p>'Is the mistress bad, sir?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes--no--I don't know, Will. But the labour pains have begun.
Would you go into the garden and tell Mrs Bellairs quietly? Don't
draw attention to it, you know. Ask her to come in to my
mother.'</p>

<p>Leathwaite went. In the parlour Adam sat down on the old
familiar sofa with the rosy apples. Nothing was changed, for
Judith had forbidden any change. There was the spinet, there was
the Chinese wallpaper, the silhouettes above the fireplace of
David and Sarah Herries. Only Dorothy's needlework-box spoke
something alien. Without knowing what he was doing he had it in
his hands, and all his life after he was to remember it--with its
polished walnut wood and satin-wood edge, the painted flowers on
the top and sides, and inside it a tray painted pink, the wooden
bobbins wound with coloured silks, the pin-cushion, the miniature
hand mirror, the folding memorandum tablet in a morocco case, the
needle-cushion of red and green wool with yellow beads, and a
star-shaped piece of boxwood. The red and green needle-cushion he
took between his hands and turned about and about a thousand
times.</p>

<p>He had known nothing like this since Caesar Kraft had, on the
day of the Chartist meeting, fallen dead at his feet. That had
been one of the great crises of his life, because at that moment
when Kraft had died in his arms he had resigned for ever all his
life's hopes of Men's Brotherhood, of some movement that would
catch the whole world up into some heavenly universal
understanding and sympathy. Resigning those hopes, he had turned
to his mother and to Margaret, the two persons in the world whom
he supremely loved. His nature had developed a certain cynicism
about the world in general. Men were not destined to understand
one another and therefore, not understanding, also would not
love. Love was to be found rather in the relationship with one or
two individuals and in service to them. So he had lived for his
mother and Margaret, and in a lesser degree for John and
Elizabeth. John's death had once again set him back, for if so
fearful a thing could happen so causelessly what was God about?
He understood then that there was real evil in the world, that a
battle was always in progress, and that one selfish, cruel act
led to many more. One bad thought even had incalculable results.
He understood from watching so small an entity as his own family
that a battle between good and evil was even there always in
progress. His was an age that believed quite definitely in good
and evil, in God and the Devil, and in so far as Adam shared that
belief, Adam was a man of his period.</p>

<p>With Margaret, after that scene in the bedroom here at Uldale
one Christmas, his relation had grown ever richer and richer. He
discovered that true love between two persons means a mutual
interaction of beautiful, gay and noble discoveries. Both must be
fine persons if love is to be full and progressive, and unless it
is progressive it is not alive. He learnt that Margaret was far
nobler that he, richer in unselfishness, in uncalculating
generosity, in ever-growing charity, but as she rose higher she
carried him with her. Love was this and only this: a
companionship that was grander in trust, in humour, in
understanding with every day.</p>

<p>He sat there, his broad legs widely spread, fingering the
furniture of the needlework-box, the little wooden bobbins, the
boxwood, the needle-cushion of red and green. He was maddened by
his inaction. He walked about the room, sat down again. Once
Dorothy looked in.</p>

<p>'How is she?' he said eagerly. 'Can I not go up?'</p>

<p>'Oh, well enough. The doctor is doing everything possible. No,
better not go up just now, Adam. Margaret is wonderful. Her
courage . . .'</p>

<p>Yes, Margaret was wonderful. But if she were to go now . . . A
hundred scenes rushed in front of him--Margaret lying in bed, her
hair spread about the pillow, waiting for him; Margaret singing
some German song as she went about her work; Margaret sitting
opposite him, sewing; Margaret listening as he read her some
article or criticism or one of his fairy-stories that he loved to
write and was so shy of showing to anybody. All quarrels and
disputes were forgotten, or if remembered had an added colour and
glow because of their intimacy. He crushed the needle-cushion out
of shape, he jumped up and shook his fist at the ceiling, then
creeping on tiptoe to the door like a child, he opened it and
listened. There was not a sound in the house. Where were they
all? Were all the guests gone? The hall was in a half-light, but
Leathwaite stepped out of the dusk.</p>

<p>'It's warmer in the library,' said Will confidentially, and
then relapsed for a moment into Cumberland. 'The spumkey fire's
burning fine--and I've told Jeames to give the mare watter and a
teate o' hay for he was driving her fast to t'doctor. But
t'doctor was on t'road anyway. Lucky thing that!'</p>

<p>He drew near to Adam as though to protect him, and Adam put
his hand on his shoulder. They whispered in the hall like two
conspirators.</p>

<p>'Will--how is she, do you think? It's been a terrible long
time.'</p>

<p>'It's a' reet, Mr Adam. It's a' reet. Dinna fash yersel'
now.'</p>

<p>They stood close together, shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>'I don't know what I'd do without you, Will,' Adam said. 'If I
were to lose her--'</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a handshake.</p>

<p>'It's not that she's pampered,' Will explained. 'Now some
ither lass, delicate, but t'Mistress--she's strong as a
horse.'</p>

<p>Adam went into the parlour again and it comforted him that
Will was outside, as it were on guard. Will always fell into
broad Cumberland when he was deeply agitated, but showed his
agitation in no other fashion.</p>

<p>The minutes passed; the clock struck the half-hour. Adam's
forehead now was damp with perspiration. It was like him to do as
he was told. They would come for him when they wanted him, but
his agony gripped his stomach as though he were taking part in
<i>her</i> agony, as though he were inside her and she inside
him. The room was dark now. He did not think to light the
candles. He stood in the darkness, his hands pressed the one into
the other, the nails digging into the flesh.</p>

<p>In the hall Lucy had lit the gas and saw Leathwaite drawn up
stiffly outside the parlour door.</p>

<p>'Eh!' she cried and started. 'I didna see ye.' Then hummed,
looking at him:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lasses lap up 'hint their lads,<br>
 Some stridin' an' some sydeways;<br>
 An' some there were that wished their lot<br>
 Had been what Ann's, the bryde was,<br>
      Ay, oft that day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'Hist!' he whispered indignantly. 'Can't you be still?'</p>

<p>But she tossed her head, smiled back at him and walked slowly
up the stairs, the taper in her hand.</p>

<p>Doctor Bettany almost knocked her over, hurrying his little
fat body--all fobs and cravat--down to the hall.</p>

<p>As he passed Leathwaite he cried: 'It's a girl! A fine
girl!'</p>

<p>'The Lord be praised!' said Leathwaite piously.</p>

<p>Bettany strode up to Adam and wrung his hand. 'A girl, Paris.
A grand girl!'</p>

<p>'Yes--but my wife?'</p>

<p>'All's well. You may see her for a moment--only a moment,
mind.'</p>

<p>As Adam tore up the staircase a slow smile lit up Leathwaite's
eyes and mouth. Then, feeling in his pocket for his tobacco, he
turned towards the kitchen, sharing with Adam the position of the
happiest man in Cumberland.</p>

<h1><a name="c402">SAYERS <i>VERSUS</i> HEENAN</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the most remarkable scenes that the London Bridge
terminus ever witnessed occurred in the very early morning of
Tuesday, April 17th, 1860. The darkness of the early April day
was illuminated only by some pallid and evil-smelling gas-lamps.
The platform, the offices behind the platform, and the street
outside the station were thronged with a pushing, swearing,
laughing, spitting, drinking, smoking throng, all men, all happy,
all strung to a key of an intense excitement. They had assembled
that they might be carried by the special monster train to
Farnborough to behold in the fields near by the great fight
between Tom Sayers, Champion of Great Britain, and John Heenan
the American. Impossible to say who were there and who not in
that thick semi-darkness smelling of damp hay and train-smoke and
escaping gas, unwashen bodies and morning air. At any rate there
were fish-porters from Billingsgate, butchers from Newgate
Market, pugilists of course, poets and journalists of course,
dandies as well, celebrated statesmen, and even, so it was
afterwards said, some eminent divines.</p>

<p>Most striking at the first showing was the amazing variety of
smell--decaying vegetables, mildewed umbrellas, fumes of vile
tobacco and stale corduroy suits--but nobody minded, nobody
cared, everyone was happy. Clothes are of an amazing variety;
there are the friends of sport, quite naturally in the majority;
there may be a white neckcloth and black broadcloth, but the cut
is unmistakable; hard-featured men, spare-limbed, fond of burying
their hands deep in their coat-pockets and never in their
trousers. Some are in fine plush galligaskins, top-boots, fur
caps, and have sticks with crutches and a thong at the end. There
is the 'swell', with his long surtout, double-breasted waistcoat,
accurately folded scarf, peg-top trousers, eyeglasses, umbrella
and drooping moustache. And there is the dandy with lofty heels
to his varnished boots, great moustache and whiskers, ponderous
watchchain bearing coins and trinkets, starched choking all-round
collar and wonderful breezy necktie, and, lastly, there is a
certain number of quiet, severe, retiring gentlemen in tremendous
top-hats, dignified black with one pearl or diamond in the black
necktie, sucking as likely as not the heads of their heavy
canes.</p>

<p>The small group of Herries gentlemen going down to enjoy
together the great event had members, it appeared, in all these
different classes, for Garth, now purple-faced and corpulent
(although he was but fifty years of age), might because of his
horsy appearance be making straight for Tattersall's. His brother
Amery was something of a dandy and wore an eyeglass. Barnabas
Newmark (Phyllis' youngest boy, now about thirty, and known to
all his friends as Barney) was altogether the 'swell', with his
double-breasted waistcoat of crimson and his trousers of the
loudest checks (but, as was characteristic of the Newmark strain,
he was, in spite of himself, a little behind the time, coloured
waistcoats having just gone out). Lord Rockage (Roger, who had
succeeded his father two years earlier) was stout, very fair in
colour, with light blue eyes. He was dressed gravely as became
his position and sucked reflectively the marble head of his cane.
(But he was not reflecting. He was thinking of nothing at all.)
The remaining Herries was young Ellis, Will's son. He was now a
boy of seventeen and strikingly resembled his father, thin of
body with the high Herries cheek-bones and prominent nose,
serious, reserved and fully conscious of his duty to the
world.</p>

<p>Garth, Arnery and young Barney were taking sips of brandy from
a silver flask and were as merry as merry could be. Garth was for
ever recognizing friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Sawyer!' he cried to a stout red-faced gentleman in
tremendous checks. 'What did I tell you? Didn't I say you'd have
a bid for Satan before you'd been on him half an hour? I told you
what to do. Just to keep jogging on him to qualify and you'd get
all you wanted.'</p>

<p>'We tried him, Mr Herries,' Mr Sawyer said in a deep
melancholy voice, 'yesterday morning against Polly-Anne and beat
her by more than a length.'</p>

<p>'There! What did I tell you? . . . Well, how'll the fight
be?'</p>

<p>'I've known Tom,' said Mr Sawyer, more gloomy than ever,
'since he was a lad high as my boot. Why, I knew him when he was
a bricklayer at Brighton. Why, God Almighty can't beat him!'</p>

<p>'Heenan is five inch taller than Sayers,' said Garth, 'and
three stone heavier.'</p>

<p>'Why, blast my soul,' said Mr Sawyer, 'he won't bloody well
get near him. There's no one on this bleeding firmament as quick
as Tom is.'</p>

<p>It was not more than a shed under whose shelter they were all
crowding, and the noise was now terrific, the back-slapping
tremendous, the drinking ferocious and the oaths Rabelaisian.</p>

<p>''Pon my soul,' said Rockage vacantly, 'there's a lot of
fellers crowdin' about. And there'll not be a Fight perhaps after
all. Wish I was in bed, 'pon my soul I do.'</p>

<p>Ellis looked at him with exactly that look of cold superiority
that had been his father's in <i>his</i> youth. But he was not
feeling superior. He was conscious of a deep and burning
excitement and of pleasure in the scene. But he would not show
it. He was by temperament intensely cautious and by training
suspicious, and, mingled with these two strains, there was an odd
element of personless, rather noble philanthropy. He was already
persuading his guardians, his mother, Stephen Newmark and Amery
Herries, that he would like to assist the Institute for
Necessitous Orphans in Wigmore Street, and the Home for Irish
Immigrants in Penelope Place. He liked to do good with his money
on condition that he need not encounter those whom he
benefited.</p>

<p>'Odd fish!' Amery had said to his sister-in-law Sylvia. 'Damn'
generous so long as he don't have to be personal. He'd give
anything to a charity and quite a bit to an Italian
organ-grinder, but he seems to me to have no heart at all--no
feeling for individuals, you know.'</p>

<p>'Wish I were an Italian organ-grinder,' Sylvia had said with a
sigh, for although they lived now in two poky little rooms near
Victoria Station, they were always quite hopelessly in debt.'</p>

<p>So Ellis now felt a cold distaste for all the humanity surging
about him, but had someone on the platform begged from him he
would have plunged his hand into his pocket and given him a
handful of silver on condition that he did not speak to him
after. He had come down from Eton last Christmas, although only
seventeen, and, after the summer, was to go into the City, in his
father's firm of Herries &amp; Herries. He had all his father's
genius for turning one penny into two, but he was more deeply
concerned than Will had been with the magnificent power of his
family. He was, indeed, even at this early age, family mad. The
Herries were the greatest family in England; even at Eton, where
he had encountered heirs of all the ages and heirs with quite as
genuine a belief in their inheritances as his own, he had never
wavered. Howards, Buckinghams, Beaminsters, Warwicks,
Cecils--they had all, in his own mind, bowed before the Herries.
His closest friend at Eton had been young Beaminster, whose
mother, then a woman of thirty-eight or so, was afterwards the
famous and hideous old Duchess of Wrexe. Beaminster said to him
once:</p>

<p>'Someone, Ellis, told me the other day that your
great-grandfather was a sort of highwayman fellow who married a
gipsy.'</p>

<p>'Quite,' said Ellis, stretching his long thin neck, 'and now
see what we are!'</p>

<p>So today he felt that this fight was arranged principally for
the benefit of the Herries: it was America <i>versus</i> Herries.
He looked upon the crowd: they were all off to Farnborough to see
Herries whack America. It was high time America learnt a lesson;
it was not the last time that a Herries would be conscious of
such a need.</p>

<p>The bell sounded and they all crowded into the railway
carriage. There was no ceremony about places, and Rockage
discovered to his disgust that a great 'labouring-man' as he
termed him, in galligaskins and a fur cap, already far away in
liquor, with a black bottle in one hand and a vast ham sandwich
in the other, was spreading all over him, and even before the
train had started had planted a large red hand on his own elegant
stout knee.</p>

<p>'Here, my good fellow,' Rockage said, trying to move his leg
away. But he was wedged remorselessly and, as was his fate
constantly in life, no one heard what he said.</p>

<p>Garth Herries and Barney Newmark had secured places together
by the window. Just before the train started Garth touched
Barney's hand: 'By God, young Barney, look there!'</p>

<p>On the platform a great scramble for places was going on.
Everyone was good-natured as, in England, everyone is unless it
is felt that injustice is being done. There were shouts and
cries, bodies were pushed forward through crowded doors by other
bodies, there was laughter and singing. A tall broad-shouldered
man with a high top-hat, a rather shabby stock, white hair longer
than the fashion and straggling white moustaches, waited quietly
apart from the struggle. He had a body that must once have been
full and strong. It seemed now to have shrunken, under the black
clothes. His shoulders were bowed. At the last moment he walked
forward and, without any effort, entered a carriage.</p>

<p>'By heaven!' said Garth. 'I thought he was coming in
here.'</p>

<p>'Why?' said Barney. 'Who was it?'</p>

<p>'Walter Herries!'</p>

<p>'What?' whispered Barney in a voice of awed interest. 'You
don't say!' He peered out of window, but the train was already
moving. He looked across to Ellis who was at the opposite end of
the carriage. 'Imagine if he had come in here!' he excitedly
whispered. 'What a family scene!'</p>

<p>'Yes, poor devil.'</p>

<p>'What did he look like? They say he was all cut up by his
son's death. A pretty little murder that was. What do you think,
Garth? Was Uhland Herries mad?'</p>

<p>'Mad as a hatter. Young Harry Trent was up North last year and
he thought he'd call on Walter--out of curiosity, you know.
Besides he was some sort of relation of Jennifer Herries--John's
mother. His father was her cousin or something. Well, he
<i>did</i> call, and he says he never had such an hour. Gloomy
house on the top of a hill. I've stayed there in the old days.
They call it the Fortress. But it's all gone to ruin, and there
was Walter Herries in a dirty dressing-gown drinking with an old
woman. Harry says he was very courteous, walked about and tried
to do the honours. And then he took him up to Uhland's room. He'd
kept it just as it was when Uhland was alive--cold windy place at
the top of the tower they have there. And Harry says he began a
long wandering thing about Uhland, said it was all his own fault
because it was he taught Uhland to hate John Herries or some such
nonsense. Harry says he suggested Walter should get out a bit, do
some shooting or hunting or something, but Walter just said that
he hadn't the heart . . . Poor devil! Hope we don't stumble on
him at Farnborough. Wonder what he's doing down here!'</p>

<p>But the train was now in the country. It was yet dark, the
land shadowy about them, but with the running into air and space
the hissing spluttering gas in its grimy glass covering seemed at
once incongruous and even itself ashamed. They had not gone far
when Garth called out: 'Why, Collins! What are you doing
here?'</p>

<p>A large handsome fellow with a high, broad head, plenty of
brown hair, very gay in a brown velvet coat, white waistcoat and
brown pantaloons, was sitting next to Ellis. He jumped up,
regardless of Herries, showing himself a man of great size and
strength, and wrung Garth's hand.</p>

<p>'Herries, by God! So it is.'</p>

<p>Garth introduced him to the other members of the family. 'Mr
Mortimer Collins, a friend of mine. One of the most promising
poets in England; one of the most important editors in England
too.'</p>

<p>'Now stop your codding, Herries. How are you, sir? How do you
do, sir? Fine day we're going to have. I've come all the way from
Plymouth, gentlemen, to see this fight, and by God if the "Blues"
interfere I'll know the reason why.'</p>

<p>'He's a friend of Adam Paris,' Garth explained, 'and editor of
the <i>Plymouth Mail.</i> Christopher North said he was the best
young poet in England--did he not, Collins? All <i>I</i> know is
that he's wiser about dogs than anyone I've ever met and he can
tell a pretty girl when he sees one--can't you, Collins?'</p>

<p>All the carriage looked at Collins with great interest, but
Collins was not at all abashed, laughed and ran his hand through
his brown hair and began to talk at a tremendous rate.</p>

<p>How was Paris? Clever fellow although lazy. Always had his
mind elsewhere, and he'd been running off when he ought to be
working. Always talking of Cumberland, but Collins could
understand that. Collins thought Cumberland a grand place. He'd
paid a visit to the poet Wordsworth once--in '48, it was--and
Wordsworth had looked like 'an old Roman Senator dressed as an
English farmer'. First-rate the Lake Country! Everyone lived to
be a hundred there. But who cared about Cumberland this morning?
He'd have walked from John o' Groats to Land's End to see this
fight. Why, he'd known Tom Sayers since he was a lad. He saw his
first fight with Abe Crouch in '49, and although Crouch was two
stone the heavier, Sayers smashed his face to pulp. And he'd seen
him fight Jack Grant of Southwark for two hours and a half and
just beat him. That had been a <i>grand</i> fight!</p>

<p>He was so jolly in his general enthusiasm and the way in which
he took the whole carriage into his confidence that they all felt
very friendly even though he <i>was</i> a poet. Barney Newmark
was especially taken with him because he had always had a notion
that he himself might be a bit of a writer. In fact those books
<i>Miss Rich of Manchester</i> and <i>Fox and Grapes</i> (which
were declared at the time to be quite as good as Whyte-Melville)
and, of more importance still, the <i>Chapters from the Life of
an English Family</i> might never have been written had it not
been for his friendship, begun at this meeting, with Collins.
Nor, in all probability, would some of the best passages in
<i>Sweet Anne Page</i> have been quite what they were had Collins
never known Barney.</p>

<p>But now they were approaching Farnborough and excitement ran
mountains high. Two gentlemen were so thoroughly drunk that it
was little of the fight that they would see. (In fact they never
got farther that day than the Farnborough pub). The train drew up
and everyone swarmed out. Once outside, a frenzy seemed to seize
the world. Light was in the sky, the grass was fresh to the feet,
the trees in their first spring green, overhead (Collins noticed
it because he was a poet) larks were soaring and singing. And he
was the only one, maybe, in all those thousands who did notice
it, for, from every side, multitudes were pouring (the crowd was
afterwards estimated at three thousand persons), men climbing the
hedges, leaping the walls, running over the grass, racing,
laughing, shouting. The meadow that was to witness the great
scene had been cunningly chosen, surrounded by ditches and double
hedges that it might be difficult for the authorities to take
anyone by surprise. Already there had appeared in <i>The
Times</i> a little notice:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p align="CENTER">THE FORTHCOMING PRIZE FIGHT</p>

<p align="RIGHT">Hertford, <i>Saturday</i></p>

<p>This afternoon Colonel Archibald Robertson, Chief Constable of
the Herfordshire Police Force, made application to the justices
assembled in petty session at Hertford for a warrant to apprehend
Thomas Sayers, the 'Champion of England', and John Heenan, the
American pugilist, in order that they might be bound over to keep
the peace . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>It happened that Amery and Ellis were separated, as they
approached the meadow, from the rest of their party. They could
see just in front of them the broad gesticulating figure of
Collins, Garth laughing and Rockage picking his way as carefully
as a hen in a hothouse. Amery felt his arm tapped and turned to
see Walter Herries at his side. He said afterwards it was one of
the most awful moments of his life. It was not only that he had
Ellis with him, that, so far as he knew, the two step-brothers
had never met in their lives before, but something in Walter
Herries' appearance caught at his heart. He was not an emotional
fellow, Amery. He had all the caution of his kind of Herries, and
then some more, but he had not set eyes on Walter for many years.
When he had seen him last he had been stout, jolly, blustering,
self-confident, ready to shout any man down, but now he stood
beside him as though he were bewildered, lost, and as even Amery,
with all his fear of exaggeration, put it, 'he had aged a
century'.</p>

<p>'Why, Walter!' he said.</p>

<p>'How are you, Amery?' Walter said gravely. 'I trust you are
well.'</p>

<p>'Very, thanks. I thought you were in Cumberland!'</p>

<p>'Cumberland? No. Business has brought me South, and I thought
that by coming here I might recover something--might recover
something--' He looked at Ellis without any recognition, and
Ellis looked at him. There was nothing else for it.</p>

<p>'This is Ellis, Walter. I don't know whether--'</p>

<p>Walter held out his gloved hand to his brother.</p>

<p>'Indeed?' They shook hands. A strange emotion seized them all.
For an instant they were so isolated that they alone might have
inhabited the globe. Then Walter walked forward by himself as
though he had already forgotten that the others existed. It was
from that moment of meeting, Amery said afterwards, that young
Ellis, he thought, got all his peculiar notions about the
family--his sense above all that the family must not be 'queer'.
No one knew, no one ever was to know, what Ellis had thought
about the terrible Uhland-John scandal. He must have heard about
it again and again, child though he was at the time, for all the
Herries in London were for ever discussing it. The papers had
had, of course, plenty about it, and every decent normal Herries
had felt it a dreadful slur on the family. Young Ellis had been
undoubtedly conscious of this, had, in all probability, brooded
on it. For he was simply the most normal Herries who ever lived;
all the Herries' dislike of queerness, poetry, public immorality,
all the Herries' distrust of the Arts, of anything un-English, of
odd clothes and eccentric talk, met its climax in Ellis. The
wandering ghost of the old Rogue and all his family found at last
their match in Will's younger son. If indeed there had been for
years growing in him a hatred of the unusual, of the 'sport', the
'misfit', how he must have hated the Uhland scandal! But perhaps
he did not realize this disgust of his fully until the moment
when he saw this figure of his own brother, dishevelled, unhappy,
alone, at a gathering so particularly normal, British and Herries
as this one. In any case this is certain--that after this day he
never mentioned poor John or Uhland or Walter if he could help
it. You could not offend him more than by any allusion to
them.</p>

<p>All his later troubles and the troubles of Vanessa and
Benjamin, and of the other Herries connected with them, dated
perhaps from this meeting at Farnborough with his brother. It is
not fanciful to imagine so. And that meeting, it is also not
altogether fanciful to imagine, became inevitable when, nearly a
hundred and fifty years before, Francis Herries rode, with his
children, for the first time up Borrowdale.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Amery and Ellis soon joined Rockage, Garth, Barney and Collins
at the ringside. Garth, of course, had friends who were in the
inner circles of Pugilism, so he had seen to it that his little
company had fine places, and Mortimer Collins was with them by
the right of the Press. The arena was a twenty-four foot one.
Behind the ropes a great multitude was pressed, body against
body, and on every face was that mingled gaze of joy,
expectation, anxiety and a sort of childish innocence as though
no one present were more than eight years old.</p>

<p>For Barney Newmark, compounded as he was of escape from all
the repressions of his early youth (his father, it may be said,
was deeply disappointed in his youngest son, who seemed to him to
have neither reverence for the things that mattered nor any
discipline of character), of imagination and sheer joy of living,
this scene with the early morning sun overhead, the turf at his
feet, the ardent eager crowd, the brilliant green of the prepared
Ring, the excitement of the event, and above all his personal
adoration of Tom Sayers, made up the supreme morning of his life.
(And, perhaps, never again would he know anything so good.) He
had never seen Sayers, but had read every scrap about him since
he could remember. And he had never heard anything but good,
because Sayers was a grand fellow--serious of mind, modest and
unassuming, utterly fearless, generous and good-living. To do the
Herries justice--men like Garth and Ormerod and Rodney--he was
the kind of Englishman they <i>wanted</i> to create. They felt
indeed that they had created him, and would not have been at all
surprised had it been discovered that he had a drop of Herries in
him somewhere. It might be that every man in that crowd felt that
he had created him just as he had created this England that was
beginning once again, after years of uncertainty, to dominate the
whole world. Nelson, the Duke, Tom Sayers--they were all Herries
men.</p>

<p>So Barney waited, his heart beating in his ears, his mouth a
little open, and his hand resting on Collins' broad shoulder.</p>

<p>'That's the great Tom Oliver,' said Collins.</p>

<p>'Oh, where?' gasped Barney, and was pointed out an aged and
grizzled gentleman superintending the last details, testing the
ropes, looking up at the sky, consulting with other important
gentlemen, inspecting anxiously his watch. For there was not a
man in the crowd who was not aware that at any moment the
authorities might arrive and the Fight be 'off'. And if that
occurred this multitude of amiable citizens would be changed in
one brief moment into a howling mob of savages!</p>

<p>It was seven-twenty by Barney's watch. A great sigh of
excitement went into the air. Sayers had thrown his hat into the
ring and a moment later followed it. So this was his hero! For a
second of time Barney was disappointed. Sayers was no classical
beauty. His face at first sight was ordinary, that of a quiet
commonplace stable-man or agricultural labourer. He seemed slight
in figure although he had great shoulders, but nothing, it
seemed, of a chest. Nothing extraordinary, for a moment thought
Barney. Heenan's hat followed, and a second later Heenan was
inside. Then when he stripped a murmur of admiration followed,
for this was surely the most magnificent human being God had ever
made. Heenan was six feet two inches in height, Sayers but five
feet eight, so that the American towered over his opponent.
Moreover, Heenan was a beauty. The sun, growing ever more
powerful, shone on his shoulders; his chest was superb, his face
handsome and distinguished. Sayers looked an ordinary hard little
middle-weight, which was what by weight he really was. Moreover,
he was eight years older than Heenan.</p>

<p>So that when Sayers stripped Barney drew a deep breath of
alarm. How could this stocky grave little fellow hope to approach
that giant? The thing was absurd, and he heard comment all around
him expressing the same fear. 'The match is a horse to a hen,'
said a wrinkled dark man beside him. A big stout gentleman in a
very high hat swore with many oaths that 'Heenan would knock
Sayers into a cocked hat in ten minutes,' and someone else cried
out: 'Tom may beat him, but may I be fried in hell if he can eat
him.'</p>

<p>Collins seemed to understand Barney's alarm, for he turned to
him and said: 'All right. Don't you worry. It's not that Tom's so
quick--Charlie Buller was quicker and so were Langham and Ned
Donally--but you wait till you see the force he uses--and his
timing! There's never been such timing since the world began!
It's the way he moves that saves him. You watch!'</p>

<p>And Barney did watch. He saw Sayers look at his man, then nod
as much as to say 'I can manage that'. Then they tossed and a
groan went round: 'Tom's lost the toss,' and a large crowd of
Americans in Heenan's corner shouted with glee. Sayers now must
take the lower ground, but Barney's hope rose again when he saw
him stand in so perfect an attitude, tapping the ground with his
left foot, his arms down, his head well back, and a smile on his
face.</p>

<p>'Oh, God, make him win!' Barney whispered to himself. 'He must
win! He <i>must</i> win!'</p>

<p>They shook hands and then, as they moved round, each man to
his right in order to avoid the other's right hand, they laughed
at each other, as cheery and friendly a laugh as you could see
anywhere on a lovely spring morning.</p>

<p>They sparred, closed, and Sayers got down easily. Their
seconds sponged them down, gave them water to rinse their mouths
with, and they came up again. It was plain that Sayers was
absolutely confident. He had beaten big men before--size was
nothing to him. Heenan led and led again, but always missed; then
he got one on his opponent's mouth, and Sayers reeled. Sayers
returned but was banged on the forehead and went down in his own
corner, whereupon the Americans whooped their delight.</p>

<p>And it was now that the great crowd became part of the fight.
Wives, mistresses, children were forgotten. All the trades and
all the labours, the small shop, the wide curve of the field as
the horses ploughed it, the window at the Club, with the last
private scandal, the hiss of the white wave at the boat's keel as
it swept from the shore, the call on the bare windy 'top' as the
sheepdog ran to his master's bidding, the gossip under lamplight
at the village wall, the last climb into the dark wood before the
lovers found their longed for security, all aches and pains and
ills, triumph and failure, all bitterness and jealousy, all were
lost and forgotten as though they had never been. Every man was
drawn into that Ring and fought for a victory that seemed just
then to be a whole life's aim. Garth forgot his last quarrel with
Sylvia when for the thousandth time she had wept and he had
sworn, Amery thought nothing of that 'pretty good thing' in
Railway Shares that Ormerod had told him of, Rockage forgot his
cows down in Wiltshire, Ellis forgot his dignity, and Collins
thought nothing of his ambitions that he hoped would bring him
from Plymouth and establish him in London as the finest writer of
his time. Barney? Barney was part of Sayers' very soul. He had
always <i>been</i> Sayers. Every blow that Sayers dealt was
Barney's--every knock that Sayers got he felt on his own
heart.</p>

<p>Only Walter--standing not far from his relations--remained in
a world that would not set him free. He watched because something
was going to happen. His loneliness would be terminated and he
would return to a moving, breathing life from which, since that
moment when they had told him that Uhland was dead, he had been
always excluded. He bent forward, watching intently, but it was
neither Sayers nor Heenan that he was seeing.</p>

<p>Four times Sayers was down, and every time that he fell all
England fell with him. Once Heenan got in a severe right, once
trying to avoid the sun he slipped, and once Heenan with a
terrible left altogether floored him. Nevertheless, Tom's
footwork was marvellous, in and out, in and out, avoiding that
long arm and always on the retreat when a blow threatened him, so
that the force of it was lessened.</p>

<p>Collins was in an ecstasy. 'Oh, look at his feet!' he cried.
'Look at his feet! Oh, the darling! There's beauty! There's
movement!' He was beside himself with excitement, gripping
Barney's arm, rolling his head to the rhythm of the fighting,
stamping with his feet on the ground. Nevertheless, the sun was
bothering Sayers (he tried continually to get Heenan to change
his ground but always failed), he was now severely marked and had
an awful cut over his eyebrow.</p>

<p>Would he last? Many voices, shaking with excitement, the words
coming anyhow, could be heard saying that Tom was a beaten man.
'The American's too big for him.' 'He's taken a size too large
for him!'</p>

<p>Barney caught Mortimer Collins' arm and in a piteous whisper
said: 'He isn't beat, is he? Oh, he can't be! He can't be!'</p>

<p>'You must wait,' said Collins between his teeth. 'He hasn't
begun.'</p>

<p>It was then that Walter Herries suddenly began to feel deep
down in his loneliness that everything would be different for him
henceforth if only Sayers won. Uhland could not return, but life
would begin again. That strange cessation of time that for five
years now he had endured would lapse. It was as though he waited
for a door to open, and, even as, years before, Georges Paris had
staked his future on the result of a wrestle on a hill-top in
Cumberland, so now Walter Herries held his breath and waited.</p>

<p>'Now!' suddenly cried Collins. 'Do you see that?'</p>

<p>Heenan had sent out a smashing blow which Sayers had avoided,
and then, jumping right back, Sayers had landed a terrific hit on
the American's eye. It was one of those sliding upward hits,
almost splitting Heenan's cheek.</p>

<p>And now Sayers was growing happy. You could see it in his
quiet confident gaze, the hint of a smile that played about his
bruised lips.</p>

<p>'I've got him now! I've got him now!' Barney whispered, his
nails digging into the palms of his hands in his excitement.
Indeed, it seemed that Sayers had. Stopping a hard lead with his
forearm he dealt a harder one, then suddenly, as though inspired
by the kindly heavens, launched out with such a thunderbolt that
it seemed as though Heenan's nose must be crushed in. The
tremendous fellow was all but lifted off his legs; the Americans
in his corner gave a kind of 'Oh!' of wonder, and how the rest of
the world shouted, Herries and all! Even Ellis cried: 'Bravo,
Sayers! Bravo, my man!' just as though he had been an honest
hardworking gardener in the Herries employ.</p>

<p>But for five foot eight to raise six foot two from the ground
was no minor feat. Yes, Tom Sayers for all his quiet peace-loving
friendly countenance could hit.</p>

<p>Again in the seventh round Sayers struck Heenan another
fearful blow which sent the blood gushing from Heenan's nose; so
weak and tottering was the American that he grabbed at Sayers'
body and they hugged, although Sayers got in some nice body blows
before they fell together.</p>

<p>And Barney, in his innocence, thought it all over. The
American couldn't stand any more of that; another little tap and
he'd be gone, put to sleep for the rest of his natural.</p>

<p>'Oh, he's got him! he's got him!' he cried, enchanted, dancing
up and down on his two feet like a little boy, and even Walter,
not far away, began to feel as though a great weight were lifting
from him.</p>

<p>'I think Sayers is winning,' he said very gravely to a man
with a broken nose, standing beside him.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't be so sure,' said the man with the broken nose.
'Why isn't Tom hitting more with his right?'</p>

<p>Barney, in fact, was increasingly aware now from the
atmosphere around him that something was going wrong. What it was
he couldn't tell. Everything <i>seemed</i> to be all right. To
look at Sayers you wouldn't suppose that he had an anxiety in the
world. His face, that would have been solemn as a churchwarden's
had it not been for the twinkling crowsfeet about his eyes, was
expressionless and innocent. He had the earnest and serious gaze
of a student of Mr Darwin or Mr Huxley. But something was
wrong.</p>

<p>'What is it?' Barney whispered to Collins.</p>

<p>'It's his arm, his right arm,' Collins whispered back. 'I
think he's broken it.'</p>

<p>Barney always said afterwards that, of the three or four most
dramatic crises in his life, that moment when Sayers broke his
arm in his fight with Heenan (or a tendon as it turned out
after--a happening quite as disastrous in the circumstances as a
broken arm could be) was the most thrilling. Life seemed to stop:
the world was held in a frozen mask, the air like ice, and no
sound in the universe. Exaggerated it sounded later, but that's
how it was just then.</p>

<p>And now it was that Barney Newmark loved Sayers, loved Sayers
as he loved himself plus the love that he had just then for Miss
Nellie Blossom of the Adelphi plus the love that he had for his
mother, brother, and sisters, and his French bulldog Louis. All
the different loves of his life were concentrated in that little
stocky man when he saw him holding his right arm across his chest
in the orthodox position as though nothing were the matter,
relying now altogether on his feet for his defence and his left
for attack, although it had always been his right that had won
him his victories.</p>

<p>And then the beautiful thing happened, for Sayers grinned,
grinned as though he were greeting an old crony, and Heenan,
although his face was marked as though it had been slashed with
sabre-cuts (for knuckles could cut into the flesh as gloves
cannot do), grinned back. Indeed so completely was Sayers master
of himself that, sending Heenan down with a horrible smasher, he
used the twenty-five seconds that he might have had for resting
in going over and peering into Heenan's face to see what it was
like when they had wiped the blood off it. He might get some
useful information that way.</p>

<p>Next there was a terrific round: one of the historic rounds in
the history of British boxing, when they fought for a quarter of
an hour and were, both of them, so badly exhausted at the end of
it that they had to be carried to their corners by their
respective seconds.</p>

<p>It was after this round that a new element entered into the
fight. Heenan was now a fearful sight, for his face looked as
though it were gashed with deep wounds. He was bleeding
dreadfully, and one of his eyes was completely closed. The
gathering of men, who felt as though they, too, had been fighting
all this while, began, spiritually, to move in a new world, or
rather in a very old primitive one. The tenseness was frightful.
Men drew deep breaths and groaned in agony of spirit, stranger
held stranger by the shoulder as though he would never let him
go. Sweat was beaded thickly on Garth's forehead. Amery could not
stand still but kept beating with his fist on another man's
shoulder. The betting was now frantic. The Americans kept up a
continual roar from their corner, and a strange rhythmical stir
seemed to beat through all that multitude, the mass of human
beings rising and falling with every movement of the two
fighters.</p>

<p>They, indeed, seemed less seriously concerned than anyone
else, for once Heenan picked Sayers off his legs and threw him,
and then there they were both laughing at one another, and it was
a strange sight to see that great American with one eye closed
and his cheek in strips laughing as though this was good
fun--although a trifle rough perhaps!</p>

<p>Indeed only once in all this time did Sayers show a sign of
anger, and that was when he spat some blood and the American
laughed. He was stung with that and rushed at Heenan, sent him
reeling with a left, and then another and then another! When he
hit him a fourth blow Heenan staggered; had Sayers had his right
arm he might, indeed, have finished the whole thing with a
knockout. Of one blow on Heenan's ribs <i>The Times</i>
correspondent afterwards said: 'It sounded all over the meadow as
if a box had been smashed in'. On the other hand, had Heenan been
clever with his right the match might ere this have ended the
American way!</p>

<p>It was now that a sort of madness seemed to swing down upon
that meadow. Not an ignoble madness either, for here were these
two men, heroes if ever heroes were, laughing like boys at play,
and one of them with his face a pulp, blinded, so that he struck
his second in mistake for his opponent, and the other had been
fighting for an hour with one arm useless, a mass of bruises and
fearfully swollen. Nor was their Cause ignoble, for they were
showing to all the world that their countries had strength and
courage, restraint and control, fairness of mind and an honest
cheerfulness, manifesting these qualities indeed a great deal
more plainly than their countries often did!</p>

<p>And now all the Herries (save Walter only) were shouting like
mad: even Ellis was crying 'Go on, sir! Well done, sir! Very fine
indeed!' and with him were shouting many other Herries, the old
Rogue with his saturnine humour, and stout David, his son--the
best wrestler in Cumberland--and old Pomfret waving a bottle, and
young Reuben in defence of the bear, young Francis rising slowly
to face his invisible enemy, and poor John winning a victory in
the loneliness of Skiddaw. They were fighting to be free, as
every man in that crowd was fighting to be free--with every blow
that Sayers struck, with every reply of the mighty blinded
Heenan, three thousand men drove with them to freedom.</p>

<p>But the spirit of madness grew more powerful. Sayers was
weakening, Heenan blinded. They had been fighting for over two
hours, and in the rear of the crowd policemen--the hated
'Blues'--were trying to break their way. Once Heenan caught
Sayers, closed, and hit him when on the ground. What a yell of
'Foul!' went up then, and the Americans roared back 'No foul!'
and the umpire said that all was well because 'the blow was
struck in the heat of fighting'. Would Sayers last? <i>Would</i>
Sayers last? Barney himself now was weak at the knees, his mouth
was dry, his eyes burning. He had been fighting, it seemed to
him, week upon week. As for a moment he leaned forward, his head
rested on Collins' shirt. It was soaked with the sweat of his
body. And Walter, in his place, was shaking. He did not know it.
He knew neither where he was nor how he had got there--only it
seemed to him that Uhland was fighting there in the Ring, and
that the moment would come when he would turn to him, crying
out:</p>

<p>'Father, you must come and help me. I'm nearly beaten'--a cry
that Walter had all his life waited for in vain.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, came the climax. Heenan had Sayers' head under
his left arm when in a corner. He was too weak to do anything but
lean on the stake and hold on to Sayers as though trying to
strangle him. He said after--and it was likely enough it was
true--that he was too blind to know what he did.</p>

<p>Sayers did all he could to free his head, but could not; with
his left he got in a blow or two. But Heenan twisted round so
that Tom's neck was hard against the upper rope and then he
leaned on it. Poor Tom was black in the face and it was plain
that he could not breathe.</p>

<p>Then came pandemonium; men were fighting and yelling. 'Foul!'
'Foul!' 'Foul!' The umpire called out 'Cut the rope!' The
ringside was broken and the crowd poured in, hemming the fighters
round so that they could only stand up against one another. Each
hit the other and they both fell down--there, prone, at the feet
of their admirers.</p>

<p>The police stopped the fight.</p>

<p>They had fought for two hours and twenty minutes. The result
was a draw. The last great contest of fisticuffs on English
soil.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Walter moved in a dream. On a wall in front of him that seemed
always to be receding, a great cock with a crimson crest was
crowing. It crowed and crowed.</p>

<p>A little common man in a fur cap kept pace beside him.</p>

<p>'Well, Guv'nor, that wor' grand. I call that GRAND!'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Walter. 'I enjoyed it greatly'--and went
back to the Fortress.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c403">SHE VISITS THE FORTRESS FOR THE LAST
TIME</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Elizabeth, forty-seven but looking oddly like a young girl in
distress, confused in fact by her inexperience, stood one very
wet morning beside Judith's bed and stared at the old lady with,
if the truth is known, a good deal of irritation. At her side,
the cause of her worry, stood her son Benjamin, now aged
seven.</p>

<p>'It isn't,' said Elizabeth, in a clear sweet voice, 'as though
he didn't know he'd done wrong, Aunt Judith. He knows perfectly
well. Besides, Timothy beat him when he found out the truth. But
he doesn't care in the least.'</p>

<p>Judith in her lace cap, mittens on her little hands, her face
smiling and serene, the article in <i>The Times</i> about Mr
Lincoln and the North and what the Americans had better do next
open on her lap, knew two things--one, that Elizabeth wished her
to be very serious in order that Benjamin should be impressed,
and the other, that she thought it high time that Elizabeth gave
up her widow's cap and black silk dress. Poor John had been gone
nearly eight years now, and gentle colours, silver grey, dove
colour, rose, suited Elizabeth so very well. Moreover, Elizabeth
would be all the happier if she married. Mr Morant of Brough was
eager to marry her. She was wasted as a widow, and Benjamin was
altogether too much for her. Judith was smiling because she was
thinking of the other children who had been too much for their
relations. She had been too much for David Herries. Adam had at
one time been too much for herself. Barney Newmark had been too
much for Phyllis and Stephen. But Benjamin was a little
different, for in this present time children, whatever they
thought in secret, had outwardly to conform. All over England
children were conforming, saying 'Yes, Papa' and 'No, Mama',
looking up to their parents as to God, believing (apparently) all
that they were told about both the creation of the world and the
creation of themselves (the first in six days exactly, the second
in a gooseberry bush), above all observing Sunday with the ritual
and solemnity of a Sacred Order.</p>

<p>All this was correct, Judith supposed, although it had not
been so when she was young, but she was now a very old woman and
must not expect the world to stand still. (The only question was:
was it perhaps going back? But how could one ask that when
Britain was triumphant among the nations?)</p>

<p>It was Sunday that had been young Benjamin's trouble. He was
quite unlike Adam as a child, for although Adam had been
independent and gone his own way he had given no one any trouble
except when he had disappeared for a whole day without warning.
Moreover, he always listened to reason. But Benjamin would never
listen to anyone, and this was the stranger when you considered
that he was the son of John, who had always listened to everyone
too much. It was perhaps because of John's tragedy that everyone
had been over-indulgent to Benjamin in his babyhood. Poor little
infant, born only a few months after his father had been brutally
murdered, murdered by the child's own uncle! Could anyone have a
more pitiful start in life? Had Benjamin been a delicate,
sensitive soul everyone would have approved and everyone would
have been satisfied. But, so odd are the workings of nature, that
that was the very last thing that Benjamin turned out to be! He
was plump, healthy and merry. No one had ever known him to cry.
He laughed all day. He did not of course know as yet of his
father's tragedy, but it was feared that when he did know it
would not affect him very greatly. It was not that he was cruel,
nor that he was heartless, but he had none of the right and
proper feelings. At Uldale, Veronica and Jane made much of him.
Dorothy petted him, even Tim paid him attentions. They all
thought him a sweet little child, for he was round and rosy and
had large yellow curls on the top of his head. But he yielded to
none of their blandishments. Jane was the only one who could do
anything with him, and she not very much. It was not that he was
hard or selfish. He was everybody's friend, would give everything
that he possessed away to anybody (they had to stop him giving
his toys, marbles, sweets to the village children); no, the awful
thing was that he had no morals!</p>

<p>That seems a hard thing to say about a child who was only just
seven, but what they meant by it was that he had no idea at all
of the difference between right and wrong. The first occasion had
been when he had stolen the piece of sandalwood out of Dorothy's
needlework-box. She had missed it; they had searched everywhere
for it. Benjamin had been challenged, had denied that he had it,
and then it had been found on his person. Timothy had whipped
him, Elizabeth had explained to him what a dreadful thing a lie
was, but he had remained cheerful and unrepentant through it all.
But unrepentant was the wrong word. He was simply unaware that he
should not tell a lie if to tell a lie was of benefit to him. He
laughed like anything when Dorothy, in her vast crinoline, tried
to instruct him.</p>

<p>Of course he was very young at the time, and Dorothy
elaborately expounded to Elizabeth that very small children never
knew the difference between right and wrong. They were born in
sin and only later became the children of Grace. But whether
Benjamin would ever be a child of Grace seemed to Elizabeth, who
knew him better than the others, a sadly uncertain question.</p>

<p>He was for ever in hot water, and at last he committed his
worst crime: he dropped a handsome silver riding-whip of
Timothy's into a deep empty well at the back of the stables. On
this occasion he at once confessed. He said that he wanted to see
how far it would fall. He was whipped, sent to bed without
supper, lectured. He minded nothing, would not say that he was
sorry, and at last was brought up to Judith to see whether she
could do anything with him. He looked at the old lady in the big
bed and thought how small she was. His round and chubby figure
smiled all over at the old lady, and the old lady smiled back at
him. This, thought Elizabeth in despair, was not at all what she
had wanted.</p>

<p>'It makes it so much worse, Aunt Judith,' she said, 'that it
should be Sunday.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, my dear. Do you think that it does?' She drew
off her mittens and then with her slender white fingers used a
silver knife to peel a large rosy apple. She had always for
breakfast a cup of coffee and an apple, a meal that everyone
thought eccentric.</p>

<p>Benjamin watched the peeling of the apple with wide-eyed
excitement. Would she be able to strip the whole apple without
breaking the skin?</p>

<p>'You see, Elizabeth dear,' Judith went on in her very small
voice that had a touch of tartness in it like a good preserve.
'I'm nearly ninety years of age, you know, and though I've got
all my faculties, thank God, still I do live a great deal in the
past. It's very hard for me to tell very often which <i>is</i>
the past and which the present. You see, for one thing I've lived
in this bedroom much of my life--always coming back to it. It was
very much the same when I was a little girl as it is now. Of
course the wallpaper's changed. It used to have blue Chinese
pagodas on it. Very pretty it was. But that tallboy is the same,
and this blue tester over my bed, and these charming acanthus
leaves carved on the wood . . . What was I saying? Oh yes, about
Sunday. Well, you see, living so much in the past I don't
understand this not allowing children to amuse themselves of a
Sunday. Of course they get into mischief. There is nothing else
for them to do.'</p>

<p>This was not at all what Elizabeth wanted. And the old lady
was becoming very garrulous now. Moreover, Benjamin, fascinated
by the apple, had drawn ever closer and closer to the bed and had
completely forgotten that he had come there to be scolded. He was
grinning with all his might and, unconsciously, his small chubby
<i>and</i> grubby fist was stretched towards Judith.</p>

<p>'There! would you like a piece?' She cut off a section with
the silver knife. 'Now what do you say?'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Aunt Judith.'</p>

<p>'They all call me Aunt Judith. Isn't it charming? And I'm
ninety years old. Well, well . . .' She put on her silver-rimmed
spectacles. 'That's the only thing, Elizabeth, that's beginning
to fail me. I can't see to read newspaper print as I did. Ah!
there's another poem about the poor Prince Consort, although he's
been dead six months. And as to Mr Lincoln--the <i>Times</i> man
says that if he would only--' She was aware that Elizabeth wanted
something of her. She stared at Benjamin severely over her
spectacles.</p>

<p>'Your mother is very unhappy about you, Benjamin, because you
will not say you are sorry to Timothy. You are seven now and
quite old enough to know that you mustn't throw other people's
things down wells.'</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>'I'll say I'm sorry,' he said.</p>

<p>'But are you sorry?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'But are you not sorry to make others unhappy? And do you not
see that the whip belonged to Timothy? What would you say if
Timothy took your soldiers and threw them in the road?'</p>

<p>'He can have all my soldiers,' said Benjamin.</p>

<p>'You see, Aunt Judith,' Elizabeth said in despair, 'it is
quite impossible to make him realize.'</p>

<p>A new tone came into Judith's voice, that same tone with which
once she had spoken to Will at Stone Ends, once to Mrs Ponder,
and more than once to Walter.</p>

<p>'Benjamin,' and he was suddenly grave, looking up into her
face. 'Will you please go at once to Timothy and make your
apologies? Without waiting another minute, please.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Aunt Judith,' he said, and instantly left the room.</p>

<p>'There, you see,' Judith said, greatly pleased. 'All that is
needed is a little firmness.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head, smiled, shook her head again.</p>

<p>'I don't know. He's such a funny boy. He'll be going to school
presently--that's, I suppose, what he needs. But I am so
frightened for him. He seems to have no idea at all as to what is
wrong. He plays with the servants just as though they were not
servants at all. He is so restless. Jane tries to teach him, but
he will never settle to his books.'</p>

<p>'There, my dear,' said Judith comfortably. 'Come and sit down
for a little. Benjamin has his own idea of right and wrong just
as I had when I was a little girl. He is generous and loving, is
he not? And he is happy too.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat down beside the bed.</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith, I'm not tiring you?'</p>

<p>'Tiring me! Oh dear, no. Why, it is only the beginning of the
day. I can do with so very little sleep now, or perhaps it is
that I sleep most of the time--'</p>

<p>'There is another thing,' Elizabeth began.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, tell me.'</p>

<p>'I am most unhappy about father. Oh, I know that it would be
of no use to go and see him. He would not see me, I suppose, if I
did go. We have talked of it before and decided that it would be
of no use. But now I hear that he has a really dreadful woman
there, a Mrs Pangloss--a terrible creature who bullies him and of
whom he is afraid. Father afraid! Why, when I lived with him you
would say that he would never be afraid . . . But it is terrible
to sit here and know that he is shut up in that horrible house
with that woman. I don't know what I should do, but it makes me
so unhappy--thinking of it--being sorry for him.'</p>

<p>Judith stared in front of her. Then suddenly she clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>'I know!' she cried. 'I'll go myself and see him!'</p>

<p>'Oh no, Aunt Judith! No, no! Why, it's a dreadful day! It's a
deluge--and you haven't been farther than the garden for
months.'</p>

<p>'That doesn't say that I couldn't if I wanted to. I'm lazy,
that's all. It's an excellent idea. I have wanted to speak to
Walter--poor Walter. Yes, it is all over, our quarrel--quite
finished, and it has brought misery enough on everybody. Yes,
I'll go and see Walter, An excellent idea!'</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door. Dorothy, Margaret, Adam and the
three-year-old Vanessa all entered. Every member of the family
paid a visit of a few minutes every morning. This had become a
ceremony as almost everything to do with Judith had now something
of the ceremonial about it. Not that she wanted it to be so. All
that she wanted was that she should feel that she was in touch
with everybody. She loved them all, man, woman and child--and she
also wished to know exactly what they were all about.</p>

<p>Dorothy was dressed for going out. She was in the very newest
fashion--a brown 'pork-pie' but with a dark red feather, a
chignon, and her crinoline raised several inches from the ground,
revealing that her stout feet were encased in miniature Hessian
boots. This was the first time that Judith had seen these and at
once she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>'Oh, Dorothy, my dear. What <i>have</i> you got on?'</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, leaning forward, settling her spectacles
exactly on her nose that she might see the better.</p>

<p>Dorothy blushed, but she was as phlegmatic and good-natured as
she was stout.</p>

<p>'Very handsome <i>I</i> call it. And I am wearing an American
Cage for the first time. You've always complained that my
crinolines are too large.'</p>

<p>'I don't know, I'm sure,' said Judith, 'why with your figure
you should run such risks.' Then, to Vanessa: 'Come here, my
darling, and see what I've got for you. Give me that little
silver box from the table, Adam.'</p>

<p>Vanessa promised to be a very beautiful child. She had hair as
dark as Jennifer's had once been, and large dark serious eyes.
She had Margaret's broad calm forehead and something of Adam's
humorous, almost sarcastic twinkle. When she had been a baby
sitting quietly on her mother's lap she would unexpectedly look
at you inviting you to agree that the world, although pleasant,
was quite absurd. She already adored her father, and he
worshipped her. She had a lovely little body, slim and straight.
Baby though she was, she carried herself with a beautiful easy
natural gesture, bearing her head high and looking all the world
in the face.</p>

<p>As a child she was no trouble at all. Adam had insisted that
she should be called Vanessa.</p>

<p>'There was once a Vanessa, a lovely lady. And there was an
Irish Dean--and there were some letters . . .'</p>

<p>'Oh, you mean Swift!' said Dorothy, who was as literal as any
Herries. 'All the same it's a very odd name.'</p>

<p>'My grandmother,' said Adam, 'was called Mirabell, and that
was a man's name out of a play by Congreve.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Dorothy. 'But I don't see why because your
grandmother was odd you should be.'</p>

<p>'Don't you?' said Adam gravely. 'I do.'</p>

<p>'I do wish, Adam,' said Judith as he brought her the little
silver box, 'that you wouldn't wear that hideous sack coat. You
are too stout for it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mother,' he said, smiling. 'But it's comfortable.'</p>

<p>(And, oh, how she loved him! When he approached the bed, bent
down and kissed her, her whole body thrilled and it was all she
could do not to put her arms around him and hold him tight to
her. But not with all those women in the room. Oh dear, no!)</p>

<p>'There, darling.' She took two sugared almonds out of the box.
This was a daily ritual.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Grandmother.' Adam lifted the little girl up, and
for a moment the three of them, grandmother, son and grandchild,
were caught together into a loving relationship that no one else
in the whole world shared.</p>

<p>'And now,' said Judith comfortably, 'I am going to get up.
Send Lucy to me, somebody, and tell James to bring the carriage
round. You can go in the barouche to Keswick, Dorothy. I am going
up to Ireby to see how poor Cousin Walter is doing.'</p>

<p>She knew that this would be a bombshell and she enjoyed
greatly the effect of it.</p>

<p>'What!' Dorothy cried as though she had just heard that the
end of the world had come. 'Going out! On a day like this! When
you haven't been out for months! To the Fortress! Why, you're
crazy, Aunt Judith!'</p>

<p>And even Margaret, who thought now that everything that Adam's
mother did was wise, said: 'Oh, but, Mother--surely that is
incautious! Listen to the rain!'</p>

<p>'Thank you, my dear. My mind is quite made up.'</p>

<p>Adam, who knew that the more his mother was opposed the more
determined she was, said, 'Well, then, Mother, if you go up
there, I go with you.'</p>

<p>'Certainly not. What should I want you for? It is quite time I
had a little air. Now it is settled. Go along, all of you.'</p>

<p>'But, Aunt Judith--' Dorothy, who was in truth deeply
distressed, broke in. 'You can't--'</p>

<p>'Nobody says can't to me!' Judith answered. 'No one ever has,
and no one ever will.'</p>

<p>'But Doctor Bettany--'</p>

<p>'Doctor Bettany doesn't know everything. It will do me a great
deal of good. And there is something I must say to Walter
Herries.'</p>

<p>'But you know what that house is. And there is some horrible
woman there now. She will be rude to you and--'</p>

<p>'No one is ever rude to me. At any rate after the first
minute. My mind is quite made up, so it's of no use your talking,
Dorothy. Now I want one word alone with Adam, if you don't
mind.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who had been listening in great distress, stayed
behind the other two.</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith, <i>please.</i> If it is for my sake, I beg you
not to go. I would never have said anything if I had thought you
would have such an idea--'</p>

<p>'That is quite all right, my dear,' Judith said, smiling at
her. 'Your father cannot eat me. I am too old an old lady for
anyone to be rude to me. The drive will do me good. Now, go and
see that Benjamin isn't getting into mischief. Jane will be
teaching him his lesson.'</p>

<p>She was left alone with Adam.</p>

<p>'Mother, is it wise? Walter is very odd, they say, and the
house in terrible disorder. At least let me go with you. I can
remain outside in the carriage.'</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the bed. She laid her hand in his large
brown one.</p>

<p>'Is it not strange?' she said. 'Do you remember, Adam? In this
very room I undressed you and bathed you and you asked all kinds
of ridiculous questions. And now see what you are! You are still
untidy as you were then, and you have that same brown gipsy
colour. And you are not as stout as I feared you would be--'</p>

<p>He sighed. Then he looked at her whimsically. 'Aye, I'm brown
and heavy but not fat, and I'm not a dandy--and what I am as well
is a failure!'</p>

<p>'Oh no, Adam! Oh no!'</p>

<p>'Now come, Mother. You had great hopes of me, hadn't you? And
I've disappointed all of them.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' she said fiercely. 'All that I hoped for you
when you were a baby was that you would be a farmer and live in
Watendlath. That, I suppose, was the mistake of my life--that I
did not go to Watendlath. But it doesn't matter now. That is the
best of being old--nothing matters very much. It is very pleasant
to sit outside and watch.'</p>

<p>He laughed. '<i>You</i> watch! Why, you are in the middle of
everything! No one does a thing in this house but you know it--'
He paused, then added slowly: 'We are rather a multitude here.
Let me see, not mentioning the servants there are--you, Dorothy,
Veronica, Tim, Amabel, Jane, Elizabeth, Benjamin, Margaret,
Vanessa and myself. Eleven of us.'</p>

<p>'And not one too many!' she said sharply. 'Now, Adam, I know
what you are going to say. You are not to mention buying that
land you were speaking of. We have plenty of money. The house is
large. There is room for everybody.'</p>

<p>He looked at her with that deprecating shy glance that he had
always used with her, since he was a baby, when he had something
to confess.</p>

<p>'I have bought it, Mother. The thing was settled
yesterday.'</p>

<p>She took her hand from his. All that old anger that rose in
her when she was circumvented, all that old distress and alarm
that she always felt whenever he was going away, seized her. She
began to tremble all over. She glared at him through her
spectacles. She pushed <i>The Times</i> away from her so
violently that it fell on to the floor.</p>

<p>'Now listen, Mother,' he began, speaking quickly. 'I am
forty-seven years of age. I have tried everything and failed at
everything. Once I tried to do something for my fellow men and
<i>that</i> failed. Then I tried to write, and although that did
not exactly fail it has never come to anything at all. Mortimer
Collins was right when he abused me one night and said that I
failed at everything because I could not <i>stick</i> at
anything. As soon as I was settled anywhere I wanted to run away.
I have <i>that</i> from you, Mother. You know that I have. Only I
haven't the character that you have, nor am I so unselfish. You
would have been a wanderer all your days had you not thought so
much of others. But I--except for you and Margaret, Kraft and
John--I've loved no one but myself! But John's death shocked me.
Kraft's death shocked me once and John's completed it. I must
settle. If I do not now, I never shall--and there is only one
place where I <i>can</i> settle. On my own piece of ground in
this country. Then I fancy that I still can do something. They
all say that I can write--Dickens said so, and Yates and Collins.
I shall never write anything that matters <i>much</i>, but it
will be something. It is not that I shall be far away. The piece
of ground above Manesty that I have bought is no distance. I
shall come here constantly. But I must have my own place, and
Vanessa must have <i>her</i> home to grow up in. There are too
many women in this house, nor is it fair for Margaret.'</p>

<p>'I am sure dear Margaret is very happy,' Judith broke in.</p>

<p>'Yes, she is happy, but not so happy as she would be in her
own home. You <i>must</i> see it, Mother. You who are so wise and
so sensible . . .'</p>

<p>She saw it. She had always had the capacity to see other
people's point of view. But this was the end--the <i>End.</i></p>

<p>She had only a few more years to live. Adam was all that she
had in the world. If Adam left her . . . All that she said
was:</p>

<p>'Pick up <i>The Times</i> for me, will you, dear? I think that
it is <i>most</i> ridiculous that Germany should wish to have a
Navy. I saw a very funny picture in <i>Punch</i> last week--'</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her, and when he felt her body
tremble, he put his arms round her. But he said no more. He knew
that she would realize this was best for himself and Margaret,
and that when she had realized that she would never say another
word on the matter.</p>

<p>Nor did she. All the while that Lucy was dressing her she
scarcely spoke. When the dressing was finished she sat down in a
chair.</p>

<p>'Lucy, did I not hear that you are engaged to be married?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame.'</p>

<p>'I hope he is a good man.'</p>

<p>'Very good, Madame. He helps Mr Boulter, the butcher, in
Keswick.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes . . . I hope he is sober.'</p>

<p>'He never touches a drop, Madame.'</p>

<p>'Well, I trust that you will be very happy. We shall be sorry
to lose you.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Madame.'</p>

<p>Veronica came in and helped her downstairs.</p>

<p>'Thank you, my dear. How pretty you are looking today!'</p>

<p>'It's terrible weather. Do you think you ought to go out, Aunt
Judith?'</p>

<p>'I don't think--I know,' she answered. 'Now you can tell James
that I am ready.'</p>

<p>James Bennett, son of Bennett Senior (now with God), a stout
sturdy fellow and practically speechless, arrived with a very
large umbrella to shelter her over the garden-path. She was
settled in the carriage with rugs and a foot-warmer. She waved
out of the window to Veronica and Jane in the doorway, and
Margaret, Benjamin and Vanessa in an upper window.</p>

<p>But, so soon as the carriage had started, she fell into a fit
of melancholy--indeed saw herself, a poor little aged worn-out
not-wanted creature, lying at the very bottom of the sort of damp
dark insect-ridden well into which Benjamin had thrown Timothy's
whip. Such a mood was very rare with her. Now for a quarter of an
hour she thoroughly indulged herself.</p>

<p>In the first place the weather helped, for it was one of the
worst days of rain and storm that the year had yet seen. From the
eastern sky the rain swung in a solid sheet--you could see it,
slanting, as though in the folds of some thin grey stuff blown by
the wind against the horses' heads. It hissed through the air and
all the ground was running with water; you could see through the
window rivulets of rain bubbling on the grass, and the rain
leaping on the roadway; the wind drove it across the land from
Solway in gusts of lines and spirals and curves.</p>

<p>'Dear, dear,' Judith thought. 'What a day to choose to come
out in after months indoors.' She wondered what impulse had
decided her on this visit; she was so very comfortable indoors,
and this announcement of Adam's had swallowed Walter completely
as though he never had been.</p>

<p>It was as though her whole life through she had been trying to
catch Adam and he had always eluded her. Of course he loved her,
but not as she loved him, for she must share him with Margaret
and Vanessa. Margaret was an excellent woman and Vanessa a sweet
baby, but after all they were not his mother. Here to her own
surprise and disgust she felt a tear trickle down her cheek. She
took her handkerchief and wiped it indignantly away. It was years
since she had shed tears; not indeed since John's death, and then
only when she was alone. But when you were old your body was
feeble, boast as you might to others. You could not be sure of
commanding it.</p>

<p>This decision of Adam's was dreadful. He said that he would
see her often, but he would not. Once he was away there on the
hills above Derwentwater his visits to her would be fewer and
fewer. She cared of course for the others--for dear Jane
especially--but they were not inside her heart as Adam was. And
she was not--although she would not admit it--at home in this new
world that was growing up around her, a world of material riches
and prosperity, a world in which the men seemed to be divided
from the women so that an elaborate sort of hypocrisy sprang up
between them when they met. Dorothy was shocked--or thought it
proper to be shocked--if you talked of cows calving or sheep
lambing. Jane and Amabel were quite resigned to being old maids,
it seemed. The countryside was covered with old maids, and yet,
on the other hand, all the girls in the County thought of nothing
but marriage, only they must not say so and indeed must pretend
that they had no notion of the barbarous practices that marriage
involved. It had been very different in Judith's youth, and she
had a sudden picture of herself and Georges and Emma Furze in
London and the things that they would discuss and that other
people would do!</p>

<p>'If it goes on much longer like this,' Judith had said to
Dorothy the other day, 'there will be no more babies, for parents
will be ashamed of creating them!'</p>

<p>She disliked too a kind of religion that was beginning to be
prevalent, a religion that Dorothy took an interest in and that
even the beautiful Veronica pretended to admire. It came, she
believed, from Oxford, and Mr Hall and Mr Eustace were its local
prophets. It consisted, so far as Judith could discover, in
talking in a high affected voice, bowing and scraping in church
and professing the saintly life. She believed that Mr Hall
<i>was</i> perhaps a Saint--she knew that he gave everything away
and lived entirely on potatoes--but Mr Eustace with his shrill
voice and ogling eyes revolted her. She had been given to read a
novel that, so she was told, portrayed the ideal saintly
character of this religious movement--<i>The Heir of
Redclyffe</i> by Miss Charlotte Mary Yonge--but she had found it
mawkish and unreal and had wanted to throw it into the fire. In
all this she was of course very ignorant; she knew nothing at all
about the Oxford Movement, but it all helped to make her feel,
when she was depressed, that she had lived far too long and had
wandered into a world that was not hers.</p>

<p>However, she was not often depressed and she did not intend to
be long depressed now. She dried her eyes, blew her nose and
tried to pretend that she was as independent of Adam as she was
of everyone else in the world. If he <i>wished</i> to go and live
on a patch of ground above Derwentwater, why, let him go! How
absurd of her, when she should be thinking of her approaching
End, to be disturbed by what <i>anyone</i> wished to do!
Nevertheless the pretence was not very successful. The very
thought of Adam, smiling, untidy in his sack coat, so ludicrously
absentminded, so clever (as she thought him), so well-read and
wise and learned but so exceedingly modest about it . . . she had
only to think of him to bring him right into the carriage beside
her! And so, after all, it might be when he was living on Cat
Bells! He could not <i>really</i> be very far away from her!</p>

<p>The carriage was now driving through the storm up the hill to
Ireby. She must prepare herself for the encounter with Walter.
This meeting with him was in fact no new idea. She had had it in
mind ever since the awful catastrophe of John's death. She must
tell him, before she died, that their quarrel was ended, that she
forgave him everything--yes, even the deaths of Francis and
Reuben--and she must try to console him a little and try if he
would not perhaps see Elizabeth and his grandson.</p>

<p>As Bennett, down whose cape the water was now pouring in a
vicious stream, whipped the poor horses up the hill, the carriage
met the full force of the storm. The wind tugged at the windows,
the rain lashed them, and she rose to the vigour of it. 'This is
the way I like it,' she thought. Something in her bones, that had
crept into them when old Squire Tom carried her the first day of
her life through the snowstorm, excited her now. She pushed her
nose against the window to see whether she had arrived, but could
realize nothing because the wet blur of the rain was so thick.
Then the carriage stopped; Bennett got down from his seat. With
difficulty he opened the carriage door and then had to push his
chest right inside to avoid the wind. His rough red cheek, fresh
with rain, was close against Judith.</p>

<p>'Well, are we there, James?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame.'</p>

<p>'What do we do now?'</p>

<p>'Well, Madame . . . best for me t'pull t'bell while you stay
inside t'carriage.'</p>

<p>'Pull it then.'</p>

<p>She could see dimly through the window now and thought how
desolate the Fortress had become. The building was dark, naked
and repellent. The stone seemed to have blackened under rain as
though it had been smoked. The wood behind the house moaned and
wailed. A pile of earth stood near the flagged path in the garden
as though in preparation for a grave, and all the plants were
beaten down with the wind. A tree somewhere rocked and screamed.
She could see so dimly that she could not be sure what she saw.
She could fancy that figures moved in and out through the rain,
and especially her fancy, the growing faintness of the sight of
her old age, made her imagine that the shape of a woman in black
cloak or shawl moved out from the trees and stood motionless,
staring at the carriage.</p>

<p>Suddenly she disliked so greatly staying in the carriage alone
that she picked herself up, found her cane, adjusted her bonnet
and climbed down into the rain, then walked with great assurance
up the flagged path and joined Bennett.</p>

<p>She heard the bell pealing through the house as though the
place were empty and deserted. She could smell the wet stale
smell of laurels and elder bushes. Then the door opened and a
slatternly girl poked her head through. Just then there was a
gust of wind so violent that Judith, slight as she was, was blown
into the house.</p>

<p>She stood in the hall and the girl gaped at her.</p>

<p>'You'd better close the door,' Judith said gently. 'It is
terrible weather, isn't it?'</p>

<p>The girl's hair had been blown across her cheek, and she
stared at Judith as though she were an apparition.</p>

<p>'I think I'll sit down,' Judith said, and so she did on a hard
straight-backed oak chair with arms that she remembered well from
the old Westaways house. A cat came into the hall, mewing . .
.</p>

<p>'Who might you be wanting?' asked the girl.</p>

<p>'Would you tell Sir Walter Herries that Madame Paris from
Uldale would like to see him for a moment?'</p>

<p>The cat came over to her and rubbed against her leg. She bent
down and stroked it, then with her two gloved hands resting on
her cane leaned forward and waited.</p>

<p>She did not have to wait long, for a door swung back and there
stood before her a great fat woman in a mob cap. 'This,' she
thought, 'must be the Mrs Pangloss of whom I have heard,' and
noticed with great dislike her face red as a ham, her thick bare
neck, her big uncontrolled bosom, her long peering nose and other
more unagreeable features. Her personal, almost passionate, love
of cleanliness made a woman such as this very unpleasing to
her.</p>

<p>The hall was dark and the woman stared about her.</p>

<p>'Well?' she said, glaring at the girl. 'What are you standing
there for? Haven't I told you--?'</p>

<p>'There's someone--' said the girl.</p>

<p>The woman turned to Judith.</p>

<p>'Yes?' she said. 'What can I do for you?'</p>

<p>'I was wondering,' said Judith, 'whether I might see Sir
Walter Herries for a moment. Pray forgive my sitting down, but I
am not so young as I once was.' She smiled.</p>

<p>The woman at once recognized her. She said: 'Oh yes? Indeed!
Well, I fear that Sir Walter is not very well today and is unable
to see anyone.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry to hear that. Perhaps if I were to see him for a
moment only--'</p>

<p>'Impossible, I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>The woman stood staring as the maid had done. Judith was so
famous a figure that this visit was astonishing. The woman's slow
brain doubtless was moving through a maze of questions. What did
old 'Madame' want? Did this threaten her own power here? Was
there some plot hostile to herself?</p>

<p>'Would you at least,' said Judith patiently, 'tell Sir Walter
that I am here?'</p>

<p>'Mustn't disturb him.'</p>

<p>'It is of importance that I should see him--great
importance.'</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said the woman more insolently, as though she had
made up her mind that Judith was not to be feared. 'Another day
perhaps, but today. Sir Walter is not to be disturbed. I'm in
charge here. I'll tell him that you inquired.'</p>

<p>The door to the left of the staircase opened and Walter
appeared. He was in slippers and a faded snuff-coloured
dressing-gown. At first he could not see who was there. Then,
almost knocking against the chair, he stumbled back.</p>

<p>'Why, Judith!' he cried.</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>'I am delighted to see you, Walter. Your housekeeper said that
you were indisposed, but I shall not keep you long. Can you give
me five minutes with you alone?'</p>

<p>He plainly did not know what to do, and she was so sorry for
him and felt so strong an impulse to carry him off there and then
from under the sharp nose of Mrs Pangloss that any old enmity
there might ever have been fell, dead, once and for all.</p>

<p>The woman did not move.</p>

<p>'Why, certainly,' Walter said. 'I have not been well. Mrs
Pangloss was correct. This is Mrs Pangloss, my housekeeper.'</p>

<p>Judith gave a little bow.</p>

<p>The woman said angrily: 'Now you know what the doctor
said--that you wasn't to see anyone, no matter who it was, and
you'll catch your death away from the fire, you know you will.
Sorry, ma'am, it's the doctor's orders, and another day when he's
more himself it won't matter, I'm sure--but I have to see to his
health. If I don't, nobody does.'</p>

<p>Here, however, Walter plucked up courage; it must have shamed
him that Judith of all people should have seen him thus.</p>

<p>'Very well, Mrs Pangloss. You are acting for the best, I am
sure, but now that Madame Paris has come all this way on such a
day . . . Pray ask Alice to light a fire in the library. That
will save you the stairs, Judith. Allow me to give you an
arm.'</p>

<p>Mrs Pangloss stood there, looking at them. She never moved
and, after they had gone, stood staring at the spot where they
had been.</p>

<p>The room into which Walter led Judith had already a fire
burning in the grate and a rich brooding odour of spirits about
it. A decanter and two tumblers, one half filled with something
that was, Judith thought, gin and water, stood on a table. This,
she realized at once, had been Mrs Pangloss' sanctum that
morning. Otherwise it was desolate enough. A picture of a hunting
scene hung crooked on a nail and there was a screen with pictures
of boxing scenes pasted on to it. Very little else. Walter
settled Judith in an armchair whose grey and disordered stuffing
protruded from the seat. A window looked out on to the soaked and
neglected garden. The wind whistled behind the wallpaper. Walter
sat down on a hard chair near Judith. She was greatly distressed
at the change in him. She had last seen him three years before,
riding in Keswick, and on horseback, wrapped in a high
riding-coat, he had had something of his old carriage and even,
she thought, arrogance. Now he had a rugged grey beard, his
cheeks had fallen, and as he sat with his old dressing-gown
huddled about him he looked more than his seventy years.</p>

<p>'If that woman was rude to you,' he said abruptly, 'I shall
dismiss her.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Judith cheerfully. 'She said you were not
well and should see nobody.'</p>

<p>'She's a good creature in her way,' he went on. 'She means
well by me--the only one who does.'</p>

<p>'Now, Walter, that's nonsense. We all mean well by you if you
will let us.'</p>

<p>'Fine words, Judith, fine words.' He drew the dressing-gown
closer about him. 'I'm always cold now. This house is damp. You
wouldn't think so when I built it, but the damp's come in just as
everything else has gone out. What have you come for?' he asked
bluntly. 'We've been meeting like this all our lives, but our
meetings never come to anything.' Then as though he had said
nothing: 'How old are you now?'</p>

<p>'I? I'm nearly eighty-eight.'</p>

<p>'Eighty-eight! Wonderful! And still able to get about.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't get about much now, you know. There is plenty
to do in the house.'</p>

<p>'Yes; got your fingers on everything, I suppose, just as you
used to. What have you come to see <i>me</i> for?' he asked
again.</p>

<p>'I have come for two reasons, Walter. First, I want you to
know that our old feud is over. At least on my side. You must not
think that I am angry or feel any enmity. The past is dead. At
any rate our quarrel is dead.'</p>

<p>He rubbed his finger against his stubbly cheek. 'The past is
never dead,' he said. 'You know that as well as I do. When you
come to our age we live in the past. It is all I do live in.
Back--back--to when my son was alive, when he could walk into
this room just as anyone did and say "Good morning". Not that he
cared for me, of course--he never did that--but he was there. He
was in this house. I could hear him moving over stairs. You could
tell his walk, you know, because he limped. Uhland was lame from
birth, you know, Judith, and that is what made him bitter--that
and my telling him when he was a baby that he had an injustice,
being lame. And so he had an injustice, poor boy, and cleverer
than anyone in the County. That is why he thought poorly of me.
He could see I had no brains, never had any. But it's too late
now. The harm's been done, done years and years ago, before we
were born.'</p>

<p>He would have continued to talk forever. Indeed he had
forgotten her, but she was so deeply touched that she rose a
little in her chair, leaned over and took his hand. Even as she
did so, she thought: 'Twenty years ago! If you had told me that I
would ever feel so tenderly! But what does it matter now? We are
both so old!'</p>

<p>He let her hand hold his, which was hot and dry to the
touch.</p>

<p>'Listen, Walter!' she said. That is what I have come to say.
You must not think that you are alone in regretting the past.
That old quarrel has done us all much harm, but I feel
that--that--that catastrophe eight years ago--it was terrible,
tragic--but John and Uhland by dying rid us all of an enmity,
something bad in the blood, that must not come back again. John
left a son, you know--a grandson whom you have never seen--and it
would be wicked, <i>wicked</i>, if his life was spoilt by it. It
seems to me now when I am old that we cannot do anything without
affecting someone else, and one bad, selfish cruel thing can
spread and spread into the lives of people we never see . . . I
want you now to be friends with us all, to see Elizabeth and your
grandchild . . . to help us all so that his life at least shall
suffer no effects from all that past trouble. Let Elizabeth come
. . .</p>

<p>She had not been sure that he had heard anything that she had
said, but at the repetition of Elizabeth's name his body trembled
and shook, he caught his hand from hers and sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>'No, no!' he cried, swaying on his feet and gesticulating with
his hands as though he were beating someone away from him. 'She's
no daughter of mine and you shan't come round me with all your
talk. She left me, and good riddance. She married my boy's
murderer. Oh yes, she did! Don't you tell me now! Do you suppose
that he didn't taunt him with his lameness, and she too? Uhland
knew. Uhland heard what they said, the two of them. Now you can
go, and pretty quick too, and don't let me catch you here again .
. . And put some coal on the fire before you go,' he said, his
voice suddenly dropping. 'This room's as cold as hell. Hell's
cold--not warm as they say. This is <i>my</i> house, and no enemy
of my boy is going to sit in it.'</p>

<p>He stood looking at her, shaking, his legs wavering. 'Well,
you are an old woman,' he said, sitting down again. 'You can stay
if you like, but don't talk such nonsense. You ought to know
better at your age.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' she said quietly. 'I'll stay, Walter, but not if
you're rude and violent. We do no good by shouting at one
another.'</p>

<p>'No, I suppose we do not,' he said, nodding his head. 'I tell
you what it is, Judith. I'm not used to company. A while ago I
went to London. You didn't know that, did you? And I saw a
Fight--a fine Fight it was too, but the man I wanted to win
didn't win, and so I came home to be by myself. I said, "Now if
you win, everything will be all right. Uhland will come back."
But he didn't win, and so what was the use in seeing anybody any
more? So I came home, and I'm not very good company. You must
forgive me.'</p>

<p>She saw that there was nothing more to be said just then about
Elizabeth. Nevertheless something had been achieved by her visit.
They sat close together now like two old cronies.</p>

<p>'You see, Walter, I'm very old--very old indeed. I may die at
any time. Not that I mind dying, but I wouldn't wish to leave any
bad feeling behind me when I go. When you are as old as I am, bad
feeling seems so very stupid--and I hope it won't continue into
another generation. Your grandfather, David, used to tell me many
stories about my father. Fancy! He has been dead now almost a
hundred years! But David Herries used to say that he thought all
the trouble in our branch of the family started when my father as
a young man sold his mistress at a Fair in a temper. You've heard
the old story. It's a legend, they say now, but it was all true
enough, I believe. My father was a good man but he had a hot
temper. That is perhaps what Uhland had too--but now those
stories are all so old and so long ago and there is a new
generation growing up. Dear little Vanessa, my granddaughter,
such a pretty child. And Benjamin, your grandson--a very lively
high-spirited boy. I don't want them to be in any family quarrel
when they grow up. The world is more sensible now than when I was
a girl--too sensible, I sometimes think, with people like Mr
Gladstone and so much church on Sundays. Of course I think young
people ought to go to church, but not as a duty. I'm rambling on,
but what I really mean is that I want Vanessa and Benjamin to
grow up without any hatred. Hatred is silly--waste of time and
temper.'</p>

<p>She had talked on, but it seemed that he had listened to none
of it. He only sat there staring in front of him, scratching his
cheek. She was trying to reconcile him with the stout, cheerful,
bullying man she had once known. How could Jennifer and the
others have feared him as they did? He had never had any brains,
only some instincts, and so he had collapsed under the pressure
of events. You must have either intelligence or spiritual faith
to stand up against life. When you had both you could be a
conqueror. Jennifer had never had any brains, so she had gone the
same way.</p>

<p>'Well, I must go now. Will you help me to my carriage?'</p>

<p>She rose a little unsteadily. When she stood beside him her
little body was at his height, he sitting.</p>

<p>She kissed him.</p>

<p>Then, to her distress, she saw slow unmeaning tears trickle
down his cheek. He did not try to stop them. He did not perhaps
know that he was crying. Gently she stroked his rough unbrushed
hair, speaking to him as though he were a child.</p>

<p>'There, there, Walter . . . Things are not so bad, my dear. I
will come again and see you. I am glad that we are friends at
last. If you want anything, you have only to send to Uldale.
There, there, Walter. Remember that we are all your friends. You
are not alone any more. Uldale is no distance, you know.'</p>

<p>He rose slowly, looked about him in a bewildered fashion, then
very courteously offered her his arm and conducted her to her
carriage.</p>

<h1><a name="c404">ON CAT BELLS: ESCAPE FROM ECSTASY</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Adam, turning on his side, caught the light from the window.
The morning clouds, fiery with gold, were piling up above Walla
Crag. <i>His</i> field--the field of all his life with its five
little trees and its arch of sloping green--rolled into the glow;
then, as though with a sigh of satisfaction, held the light; the
little trees stood up and stretched their morning limbs. He
looked at the field, thought that it was late (but they had not
returned from Ambleside until one this morning), looked over his
shoulder and saw that Margaret was yet deeply sleeping, then
stretched out his brown hand to the bedside table and found
Barney Newmark's letter.</p>

<p>There was light enough now to read by. Barney described
Thackeray's funeral:</p>

<p>'. . . You would have been moved, Adam, although you thought
the man proud and sensitive. So perhaps he was, but he had reason
to be. Maybe he was the loneliest man I have ever met. One of the
kindliest too. I could not but remember the first time I ever
went to his house--his table covered, not with books and papers
as you might think, but with compasses and pencils, bits of chalk
and India ink, and little square blocks of box-wood. He was
drawing, not writing. There were no signs of the author in the
room, only the appliances of the draughtsman, and when we chatted
he would rather talk about drawings than about books. And in what
a kind, generous way, putting his hand on my arm, he said: "Well:
and how can I be of any service to you?"</p>

<p>'And then there I was at Harlesden and a labourer going to his
work said, quite casually: "You must make haste if you want to
see him buried." It was a bright December day, everything shining
and glittering, a dense black crowd waiting by the grave, and
then the hearse--quite a common one, one of those plain, dull,
black-painted boxes upon wheels without feathers or any ornament,
drawn by only two horses: two or three carriages following, and
then the straggling mourners--Dickens looking defiant as though
he would like to knock someone down, Cruikshank, Millais, Louis
Blanc, and the <i>Punch</i> people--you know, Mark Lemon, Leech
and Tenniel--a lot more. The eight men could scarcely carry the
coffin--he was a giant, wasn't he? Then the short ceremony--thank
heaven it <i>is</i> so short!--and the mourners elbowing their
way through the crowd to take a last look. And wasn't this an
irony? There was a heavy prosaic policeman by the grave and as we
filed past he said to the man in front of me: "Now don't be in a
hurry; follow each other to the right, and you will all see
comfortably." Would not Thackeray himself have liked that. The
younger men of course are saying that he is already
old-fashioned, but I myself think . . .'</p>

<p>Adam did not just then discover what it was that Barney
thought. He put down the letter and lay for a while looking out
across the Lake to Walla Crag. Thackeray was dead and he himself
was forty-eight, and his mother, amazing woman, was eighty-nine;
the Americans were fighting one another, and Bismarck was
bullying the Danes; he must widen the vegetable-patch beyond the
trees to the right of the house, and today he would start his
fairy story--the one that had been in his head for more than a
year now--and young Benjamin was riding over for the day and
night from Uldale. It was the last week of his holiday before he
returned to school--and here he was, he, Adam Paris, who had done
nothing with his life as yet at all, but was happy, happy, happy
. . . here in this January of 1864, in his own cottage that he
had helped to build with his own hands under the brow of the
hill, and Margaret his wife lying beside him, and their child
cradled in her arm (for in the night, when they had returned, she
had wakened, climbed out of her cot and demanded to come to
them). Well, well . . . and Thackeray was dead, dead and
buried.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand again, this time for a volume of a
novel. The novel was called <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel</i>;
it was written by a young man, George Meredith. Although it had
been published some four years or so, he had only now heard of
it. An unusual book! Fantastically written but new--new in
thought, in style and in audacity. And Thackeray was
old-fashioned. Thackeray was dead. He rolled over and laid his
arm very lightly but protectively over Margaret. They had sailed
all the perilous seas now and were in harbour, through passion
(but Margaret had never been very passionate), through that
strange period of isolation the one from the other, when they
knew one another too well and yet not nearly well enough. (That
had been ended by the scene at Uldale that Christmas-time.) Then
through the wonderful stage of renewed passion and a heightened
glorious intimacy. (This stage had included Caesar Kraft's death
and the end of Adam's 'Brotherhood' ambitions.) Then, back in
Cumberland, out of passion and into this, the real glory of every
marriage that can attain it, a confidence, a trust, an intimacy
so great and deep and calm that it was like Derwentwater there
beyond the window.</p>

<p>She would never <i>quite</i> understand him. There was a vein
of cynicism running through his nature that was quite foreign to
her. Nor would she ever understand his restlessness. Once she had
his love and the love of their child, and <i>knew</i> that she
had them, nothing could ever disturb her again--except, of
course, losing either himself or Vanessa. Always when he left
her, even for an hour or two, a little wrinkle lined her calm
brow. She was not <i>really</i> happy again until he had
returned. But she was no longer possessive as she had once been.
That was because she was sure of him now.</p>

<p>At that thought he moved a little restlessly. Did he want her
to be sure of him? Did any man want his wife to be sure of him,
and was not every wife unhappy unless she <i>was</i> sure? That
was perhaps one of the eternal misunderstandings in marriage. And
in this his mother completely understood him. In every way his
mother understood him, shared his restlessness, his longings, his
disappointments in himself, knew him as no one else did. He and
she were wanderers constrained by the circumstances of life to be
stay-at-homes. Had he not married Margaret what a useless,
worthless wanderer he would have been! Like his old legendary
grandfather! Yes, he had been lucky to marry a woman like
Margaret, so good and loyal, faithful and true. Once he would
have been wearied and irritated by too much goodness and
fidelity.</p>

<p>He got out of bed very quietly and went down to the yard
behind the house for Will to sluice him down.</p>

<p>Although it was early January and mortal cold, he did not
shrink from the sluicing. The yard was hidden from the world save
for the little wood on the rise of the ground. No windows looked
on it, and it was sheltered from the winds. Will was already
there, cleaning the boots and hissing away at them like a
hostler. He straightened himself when he saw Adam and stood up,
grinning, his yellow forelock straggling over his forehead, his
eyes as blue, direct and unflinching as those of an honest and
fearless child, his body balanced easily on its strong legs.</p>

<p>'I'm late this morning, Will.'</p>

<p>'Aye. You was late last night.'</p>

<p>'Lovely day.'</p>

<p>Will looked up. The sky was blue and laced everywhere with
little clouds that still had tints of amber and rose.</p>

<p>'Cold this morning,' Adam said.</p>

<p>He looked at Will with great affection. The whole day started
wrongly if he did not have a brief talk alone with Will at the
beginning of it, for his relation with Will was that of man to
man, rid of all the uncertainties, sudden crises, sudden
darknesses that haunt like ghosts the relation of the sexes. In a
way Will understood him better than did either his mother or
Margaret. In a way Will loved him better than did either of the
women, for it was a love completely unselfish, that asked nothing
in return, that was disturbed by no moods or reticences. When
Adam was in a temper or caught into some creative distance far
from all human agency or had a cold or a headache or felt his
liver, Margaret was disturbed as though she were in danger of
losing something (although she had learnt to conceal this
disturbance, Adam knew that it was there and it irritated him),
but Will was unchanged. Let Adam have what mood he wished, Will
loved him just the same. He could be jealous, and was often
confoundedly obstinate and pig-headed, but his loyalty, devotion,
trustworthiness never varied a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>Two wooden buckets filled with cold water stood side by side.
Adam threw off his shirt and breeches, then shivered as the cold
air struck his bare flesh.</p>

<p>'Quick, Will. Quick, you devil!'</p>

<p>Will took up one bucket in his two arms and with a heave threw
the water over Adam. Then the other. Then quickly he caught a
rough towel that was hanging on the back of the kitchen door,
seized Adam and rubbed him with great violence, hissing
furiously.</p>

<p>Adam ran into the kitchen and stood naked in front of the
roaring fire. Now he was glorious. He was in fine condition.
Drops of water clung to his beard and his hairy chest. His flesh
was firm and strong. His heart beat like a good steady hammer. He
took deep breaths. Will watched the operation with high
satisfaction.</p>

<p>'You know, Will,' Adam said, stretching out his bare arms, 'my
mother has told me that her father used to have his man swill him
down at Rosthwaite where he lived, in just this way. He was a
queer character, he was. My mother has a heap of tales about him
from his son, her stepbrother. He was years older than she
was--David Herries, I mean. And now she's nearing ninety. Takes
you back a long time, doesn't it?'</p>

<p>'Aye,' said Will. 'It does that. We're born and we're wed and
we're dead before we know. 'Tis odd when you think of it, Mr
Adam, that folk make the fuss they do when they're dead so quick.
About little things, I mean. Now there was that man from
Seathwaite last evening. Was in here with a long tale about a cow
he'd lost. I told him not to fret and he was furious, as though
I'd stolen the damned cow myself. Mary will be in likely. I can
hear her coming.' This was the old woman from the farm halfway to
Grange. She came every day as help.</p>

<p>Adam pulled on his shirt and breeches and went upstairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later he was sitting in his room waiting to begin his fairy
story. This room--not very large--was square, papered a dull
rather shabby red, and the two windows looked full on to the Lake
and Walla Crag. The wall opposite the windows was lined with
shelves, and there were his books, not a great collection, some
four or five hundred in all.</p>

<p>They were, moreover, a mixed lot, in no sort of order. A faded
row of little blue volumes of the <i>Ilaid</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>
had for companions <i>Pickwick</i> in its shilling parts (the
covers of some of the numbers disgracefully torn), Rogers'
<i>Italy</i> with the handsome illustrations, Arthur Young's
<i>Travels in France</i> and Leigh Hunt's <i>Story of Rimini.</i>
There were thirty volumes of the 'English Poets', ten of Chaucer,
<i>Sir Charles Grandison</i> and <i>Tristram Shandy.</i> On the
table at his side were two volumes of <i>Richard Feverel,</i>
Huxley's <i>Man's Place in Nature,</i> and <i>The Woman in
White.</i> By itself on the other side of him was a fresh
brilliant copy in green and gold of Barney Newmark's first
novel*--<i>Dandy Grimmett</i>--in three volumes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>* <i>Dandy Grimmett,</i> by Barnabas Newmark: 3 vols, Suller
&amp; Thorne 1863.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'They have bound young Barney very handsomely,' he thought.
(He still looked on Barney as an infant although he was now
nearly thirty-four years of age.) He felt a pang of envy, regret,
sadness. There was young Barney, of whom no one had thought very
much, publishing his first novel and some of it not bad either,
especially the racing scenes, the fight (plainly taken from
Sayers and Heenan), and the last chapter when old Dandy, dying,
is brought back to his rooms in London and hears the carriages
rolling to the theatres, the cries of the newsboys, and the thick
heavy ticking of the clock on the marble mantelpiece. He's been
influenced by Thackeray, of course--not doing anything new like
this young man Meredith. But is it important to be new? Nothing
is new but superficials. He can paint a scene that is real. He
knows his world . . . Damned clever sketch of his father, old
Stephen. He'd deny it, of course . . .'</p>

<p>His mind went floating away to the lake that lay in the
morning sun like a snake's skin, grey and rippled, convulsed, it
seemed, with little shudders. The sunlight hung above it on the
flanks of the hill as though afraid to descend. He pushed open
the window and looked out, heard the stream running at the back
of the house, smelt the dead bracken, the gritty flakiness of the
dead earth, and saw a snowdrop, solitary and beautiful, bend its
stem in the breeze.</p>

<p>He heard Vanessa calling. His heart warmed. It was all he
could do not to go out to her, but he knew that once he had left
that room incident after incident would occur to prevent his
return to it, as though a malicious Fate were determined for ever
to hold him back from doing anything. With a sigh he closed the
window and went back to the table. He picked up a number of
<i>London Society</i> that had just arrived and read from the
serial story:</p>

<p><i>'"Nor need you wish to do so, Miss Fleming" said Jane
quickly. "Nor, if you were thrown on the world, would you ever be
what Milly and I are now. We have had unusual advantages from our
cradles, and with great natural aptitude, have improved them to
the uttermost."'</i></p>

<p>He sighed again. 'Great natural aptitude . . .' 'Improved them
to the uttermost.' No, people did not talk like that. Why were
novels so silly?</p>

<p>But this seemed to encourage him. <i>He</i> was going to write
a fairy story. He sat down resolutely, drew the paper in front of
him and wrote in his firm strong hand:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">THE DWARF WITH THE PURPLE COMB*</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He sat, looking out of window, biting the feather of his
quill. Then he was off and away!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had five lovely
daughters. The names of the five Princesses were Hazel, Rosamond,
Amaryllis, Mellicent and Mary. Mary was the youngest and she was
not given so grand a name as the others because the King, her
father, had wanted to have a son and was so grievously
disappointed when the Doctor told him that the baby was a girl
that he shut himself into his bedroom for four and a half days
and refused to see anybody, even the Queen. He lived all that
time on bread and water. So at least it was said. But Fortunatus,
the son of the Woodcutter in the Forest near by, saw the Palace
gardener climb on a ladder and hand through the King's bedroom
window a gold tray that had on it a gingerbread cake, a roast
goose, a Christmas pudding and a dish with oranges, plums and
apricots.</p>

<p>Fortunatus told his father, the Woodcutter, what he had
observed, and his father said that he must never mention it to
anyone or he would lose his head. Mary, who was the loveliest
child ever seen--she had hair as dark as the ravens and a smile
so sweet that everyone at the Court loved her--was always
punished when her sisters did anything wrong. For example, one
fine morning Princess Rosamond was given a beautiful dress by her
Fairy Godmother (it was her birthday). The dress was made of
tissue and silver and it had buttons of green jade, a collar of
emeralds, and the sleeves were decorated with the feathers of the
Bird of Paradise. When Princess Mellicent saw this beautiful
dress she was so angry because <i>her</i> Fairy Godmother had
given her on <i>her</i> birthday only a needlework-case. So she
took the gold scissors from her needlework-case and when Princess
Rosamond was practising the piano in the Green Drawing-room she
went into her sister's bedroom and cut the beautiful dress into
shreds.</p>

<p>Now when this was discovered and Mellicent had confessed to
what she had done, Mary was put to stand in the corner of the
Audience Chamber with her face to the wall so that everyone who
passed by could see her.</p>

<p>It happened then one fine morning that Fortunatus, the
Woodcutter's son, was sent by his father to the Palace with a
wheelbarrow full of logs for the Royal fireplaces, and, peeping
in (for he was a very inquisitive boy) at the door of the
Audience Chamber, he saw the lovely little Princess standing with
her face to the wall . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p>* <i>The Dwarf with the Purple Comb, And other Stories;</i> by
Adam Paris, Harris &amp; Sons, 1865.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Little Vanessa ran down the path and up the road. It was time
for Benjamin to be coming, and from the corner where the stream
ran from the tops straight like a silver arrow into the Lake you
could watch the higher bend of the road. She danced about,
clapping her hands because it was cold.</p>

<p>She was wearing a dress of green and black checked taffeta,
which was the new material. She was immensely proud of it and had
begged to be allowed to wear it because Benjamin was coming. She
was already tall for her age, carried herself to her full height,
and now, when she was dancing, every movement was natural in its
grace as the silver pattern of the stream, the dull amber of the
dead bracken and the bare wood whose trees were flushed in the
distance like an evening sky against the grey Lake filmed with
ice. Skiddaw and Blencathra were powdered with snow, and hard
round clouds like snowballs hung above their lines. Vanessa's
mind was intently fixed on Benjamin. Although he was over four
years older she thought that he was a perfect companion. She was
even then an excellent listener; her curiosity was acute, and she
could never be told enough about anything if someone wanted to
tell her. Benjamin told her the most extraordinary things.
Everything that happened at Uldale was of absorbing interest to
her, and she spent so much of her time with grown-up people--her
mother and father, Will, and Mary from the farm--that although
she was entirely a child and in many things still a baby, she
understood the <i>lives</i> of grown-up people, knew why they did
things and could <i>imagine</i> their world. Her grandmother--the
old lady who was as smart as a pin, all white and black (and the
very <i>whitest</i> of white!) with her cap, her ivory cane, her
shoes with the silver buckles, who was so kind, amusing,
understanding, but could, all in a moment, be so sharp and
commanding (very like the Queen of England)--was to Vanessa
simply the most miraculous person in the world, composed of
magic, fire, ice, diamonds. There she was in her room, older than
anyone had ever been, but more acquainted with all that Vanessa
was thinking than anyone save her mother. Then there was Aunt
Jane, the nicest of all the Aunts. Aunt Veronica who was
beautiful, Aunt Amabel who could throw a ball like a boy. Uncle
Timothy who was so big that he could take the whole of you in his
hand if he wished, Aunt Dorothy who was always busy, James the
coachman, Daniel the stableman, Martha the cook--and so on, so
on--a whole <i>world</i> was in Uldale. One could never have
enough of it.</p>

<p>And Benjamin was her Uldale storyteller. She would like him to
go on for hours telling her things, but he could never be still,
never stay in one place more than five minutes. And Vanessa
thought this unusual, because his mother, Aunt Elizabeth, was so
quiet. She would sit all evening in the same corner of the sofa
reading a book--only often, as Vanessa had noticed, she was not
reading, but would put down her book and sit staring in front of
her. Benjamin had no father, which, Vanessa thought, was terribly
sad for him.</p>

<p>Ah! there Benjamin was! He came trotting round the corner on
Albert, his pony (named after the Prince Consort, who had died
the very month that Uncle Timothy gave it him). Mumps the dog was
running at the side. Mumps loved Benjamin, and even now, when he
was ten years old or more, would never leave Benjamin's side
could he help it. The boy saw Vanessa and waved his riding-whip.
When he came up to her he burst out laughing. His round, plump
face was crimson with the cold air and the exercise, and his
funny small nose needed wiping.</p>

<p>'You're wearing a new dress!' he shouted.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, still dancing. 'And there's ice on the Lake.
It will be frozen perhaps tomorrow--enough to skate on.'</p>

<p>They went up the path to the cottage, and as soon as Benjamin
was off the pony he felt in his coat-pocket and produced a large,
very sticky chunk of toffee.</p>

<p>'Have some!' he said, trying to break it.</p>

<p>'Did Uncle Timothy give it you?'</p>

<p>'No. I stole it from the kitchen. Mother said I wasn't to have
any because I was sick last time from eating so much, so I had to
get it from the kitchen, and Martha nearly caught me.'</p>

<p>Benjamin always puzzled Vanessa in this way, because he was
for ever doing things that he was told not to do. When he was
caught he never lied nor did he seem in the least to mind
punishment, but it appeared that you had only to make a rule for
him to want to break it.</p>

<p>However, she took some of the toffee and, with their mouths
full, they went round to the back to put the pony up and see
Will. When they were in the back-yard Benjamin turned a
somersault. He had just learned to do it. 'There's a boy at
school called Turnip,' he explained. 'And he can do it and he
said I couldn't, so now I can.'</p>

<p>'What a funny name to have!' she remarked.</p>

<p>'They call him that because his <i>real</i> name is
Turner--see?' Benjamin said, turning head over heels again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the living-room of the cottage Adam had few books, but he
had been given two things out of the parlour at Uldale and these
he prized over all his other possessions--one was the old spinet
with roses painted on its lid, the other the music-box with the
Queen in her green dress and the King in his amber coat. When
Judith, growing too old to argue violently with Dorothy, saw that
big heavy new furniture was coming into the parlour do what she
would, she insisted that Adam should have the spinet for his
cottage. She would have given him the sofa with the red apples
also had she not felt a superstition. Her hand had rested on that
when she had made her great decision . . .</p>

<p>Adam's living-room had not much furniture. There were the wax
flowers that he had bought Margaret at the Pantheon. The square
carpet had eight groups of flowers on a light pink ground. There
were three carved mahogany chairs with needlework seats and
backs. There was a chiffonnier bookcase, brown and gold with
marquetry panels. These things had been presents from various
members of the family. Carey Rockage's wife had given him two
cornucopias, Will Herries the bookcase. On the walls against some
very variegated wallpaper was a watercolour called 'The Lady of
the House', an engraving of Watendlath, and a Baxter print,
'Dippers and Nest'. In one corner of the room was Vanessa's joy,
a Peepshow of the Central Hall at the Great Exhibition. Over the
mantelpiece was hung a Sand Picture, 'Saddle Horse', by James
Zobel. Barney Newmark had given him this one Christmas. So the
room was an odd jumble, and he didn't care for anything in it
save the music-box and the spinet. But it was in this room and
among these things that he experienced a little scene with young
Benjamin. He had reached a point in his fairy story where the
Dwarf had tapped on the Princess Mary's window. The Palace Garden
was flooded with moonlight. She came to the window, and, standing
on top of the ladder, he whispered to her that, if she would come
with him, he would take her to the orchard and there, hidden in
the ground at the roots of an old apple tree, he would find for
her the Purple Comb . . .</p>

<p>At that point everything had ceased. He could see no more the
Princess, the Dwarf, young Fortunatus. All had vanished, the Lake
rippled under its silver shading of ice, and Blencathra had the
bloom of a plum. Soon it would be time for the meal. He was
hungry, so, rubbing his hands, he went into the living-room. A
moment later Benjamin came in.</p>

<p>'Uncle Adam,' he asked, 'can you wrestle?'</p>

<p>'No,' he said.</p>

<p>'Try,' said Benjamin, and without a moment's warning he pushed
himself on to Adam. He butted his stomach with his round head,
tried to bring his arms together around Adam's broad thighs,
twisted his small legs round Adam's thick ones. He put a
ferocious energy into this, blowing and grunting, straining every
muscle in his body. For a moment he made Adam rock. Adam could
feel the muscles of the boy's leg strung to their utmost against
his calf. The two small hands tore at his waistcoat. A button
flew off. The hands groped inside his shirt, pinched his
flesh.</p>

<p>'Hi!' he called out. 'That's enough! You're hurting!'</p>

<p>'I'll do it! I'll do it!' Benjamin gasped. 'I'll bring you
down!'</p>

<p>Adam, laughing, put out his arms, caught the boy to him with a
bear's hug, then swung him into the air and held him there.</p>

<p>'Now what will you do?'</p>

<p>Benjamin kicked. Then he was rolled on to the floor, lay there
for a moment panting.</p>

<p>'Things look funny from here,' he observed. He got up. 'I
haven't it right yet. There's a trick you do with your left leg.
Next time I shall manage it.' His hair was dishevelled, his
cheeks crimson, his shirt open. He grinned.</p>

<p>'You have torn one of my buttons off,' Adam said.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's all right. Aunt Margaret will sew it on for
you.'</p>

<p>He came close to Adam, leaned against him, looked up at him,
smiling, but with a strange mature glance.</p>

<p>Adam said: 'Are you liking school? I hear that you were in all
kinds of trouble the last term. Why was that?'</p>

<p>Benjamin nodded.</p>

<p>'I can't help it, Uncle Adam. If anyone tells me to do
anything I don't want to do it.'</p>

<p>'Why's that?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I expect it's because my uncle killed my
father. There isn't another boy in the whole school whose uncle
killed his father.'</p>

<p>The words came out quite easily, with no sense of
self-consciousness, no unhappiness--a clear statement of simple
fact. To Adam those words were like thunder in his ears. The
floor seemed to rock. He didn't know that the boy had any notion
of the way that his father had died. They had, all of them, for
years been in a conspiracy to prevent any allusion to it before
the boy, and although at first it had seemed a vain hope that he
should not hear, as the years passed they all thought that they
had succeeded, for when Benjamin spoke of his father it was quite
naturally. He seemed to believe that he had died of some illness
just like any other man.</p>

<p>Benjamin nodded.</p>

<p>'You thought I didn't know. I have known for years and years
and years. First a farmer at Peter's House told me. I know just
what they did. They rode through the mist to Skiddaw House. They
had arranged it all, and my uncle shot my father and then shot
himself. And my father hadn't a gun. So you see I'm different
from all the other boys, and I'll be different all my life.'</p>

<p>Adam did not know what to say. He moved off and looked out of
window. Then he turned round.</p>

<p>'Your father,' he said, 'was a very fine man and I loved him.
He always did the right thing and so must you.'</p>

<p>Benjamin answered quickly, as though he were speaking in
someone's defence.</p>

<p>'I love my father more than anyone, and if I had been there
with him I would have taken the gun from my uncle and shot him,
and all my life I'll kill men like my uncle who are beasts and
cowards. I don't care. I'm not afraid of anyone, and I'll never
do something just because someone tells me . . .' His voice
suddenly was the voice of a small boy. 'I'll be like Robin Hood.
He was an outlaw and I'll be an outlaw. I have a band of outlaws
under me at school and we're not afraid of anybody.'</p>

<p>To Adam there came a quick picture of a wood, a pool, a man on
a white horse and himself dancing in defiance of that rider's
whip . . .</p>

<p>He came across the floor to Benjamin and put his arm around
him.</p>

<p>'I was like that myself once and now I'm an old gentleman who
writes fairy stories. The great thing,' he went on, holding the
boy close to him, 'is not to be bitter against life because of
what happened to your father. Don't allow things that have
happened in the past, Benjamin, to spoil your life. The past is
past. They are ghosts, all those dead men.'</p>

<p>'My father is not a ghost,' Benjamin said. 'I have his picture
and a riding-whip he had and his hairbrushes. I took the
hairbrushes out of Mama's room and I've hidden them. No one knows
where they are but me. And one day I shall meet someone like my
uncle and I will shoot him just as he shot my father, except that
he shall have a gun, so that it's fair.'</p>

<p>Adam shook his head. 'That's no good,' he said. 'Because a
wrong was done once, to do another wrong doesn't make things
better.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Uncle,' Benjamin said. 'I can make a somersault. I
<i>think</i> I can make two now. Here! Look!' and he turned two
somersaults, one after the other, in the space between the chairs
and the table. He tumbled straight into old Mary who was helping
Margaret to bring in the meal.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Had Benjamin affected him? When they were sitting after the
meal quietly watching the sunlight stain the flowers of the
carpet, the gilt of the bookcase, and strike, as though
maliciously, the simpering self-importance of 'The Lady of the
House', he felt a curious and abnormal ecstasy of perception. It
seemed to him that his senses were all tingling with an extra
activity.</p>

<p>Margaret, opposite him, was making a basket cover in old silk
patchwork. On a ground of dark green she was forming a
kaleidoscope pattern of glittering scraps--flakes of crimson,
sea-green, primrose, hyacinth blue, the rose of apple orchards,
the gold of corn. On the grey stuff of the lap of her dress the
fragments of silk lay scattered, her look so serenely safe and
happy that it caught at his heart. Once and again she would
glance up at him and smile. Vanessa and Benjamin were stretched
on the floor, their heads together, looking at a book of Japanese
drawings. From where he sat he could see the brilliant figures of
birds and men in blue and crimson carrying burdens over bridges
and the wide expanse of purple seas. Everything was colour and
everything was peace. Tiny details seemed to wear a heightened
significance, the buttons on Vanessa's dress, freckles on
Benjamin's snub nose, the needlework pattern on the chairs.</p>

<p>He was filled with a kind of immortal ecstasy. This he had
achieved. Through all the disappointments and failures of his
life he had caught this and held it--love, fatherhood, security.
The patch of ground upon which his feet were set was his, this
hill, the silver birch gleaming in the sun beyond the window, the
stream of music he could hear, this Cumberland that all his life
long he had worshipped, and beyond it England, the hills running
to the sea, the valleys running to the South, all this land that,
now that he had his home, flowed to the North, South, East and
West. Running from his door to all the seas, his for ever and
ever, although his realization of it lasted only for a
moment.</p>

<p>His happiness caught him at the throat. His eyes were blinded.
He moved in his chair, and Margaret looked across at him and
smiled.</p>

<p>Then Benjamin glanced up at them and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>'I want to go out! Come along, Vanessa! I'll race you!'</p>

<p>They opened the doors and ran out into the garden.</p>

<p>It was as though he had himself spoken. He felt suddenly that
his security was dangerous. He did not want it. He was bound, a
prisoner. Somewhere, a small child, he was running, running,
escaping, shouting, and his mother was with him. Panting, they
raced up the hill to see the sun rise. The woods fell below them,
the Tarn was dark, and he could hear the sheep rustling past him
up the dark path. His mother was a gipsy and he was her gipsy
son. He could see the lights from the painted carts--a horse
neighed . . . waving his arms and shouting he breasted the hill .
. .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He woke as though he had been sleeping, and saw Margaret
choosing the colours from the fragments of silk, holding a scrap
of rose against the light to see how it would do . . .</p>

<p>'I'll be back, Meg,' he said.</p>

<p>He went to the door and almost ran from the house. He began to
climb through the dead bracken above his stone wall. As he
mounted he heard the voices of the children from the garden, a
cart was creaking down the road that was already a white ribbon.
The Lake rose and he saw that the sun had veined it with patterns
of light, here there were pools of grey and ashen pallor and
there deep shadows of saffron--all confined by the hills,
Skiddaw, Saddleback, Walla Crag. As he climbed, the Lake and the
hills climbed with him. The air was cold like a whip, but so
fresh that it struck his cheeks as the water had done when Will
sluiced him that morning.</p>

<p>Then he began to run, he called aloud, he shouted. He stumbled
and fell over the stones and thought how old Rackstraw had told
him once: 'Clouds and stones! Stones and clouds! That's what this
country is!'</p>

<p>His breathing hurt him like a knife, for he was no child now
but a stout middle-aged man with a beard and middle-aged habits
of comfort and laziness. But he liked the catch at his lungs, the
bruise on his knee where the stone had hit him. He climbed,
stumbling, waving his arms, turning to catch the Lake and the
hills with him and draw them up. He did not know that he was
climbing like a madman, climbing as he had never climbed that
hill before, because he was part of the hill, the wind, the sun.
He hurled himself over the last boulders and flung himself on the
strong, resilient turf, lying there at full length, his arms
spread out, his chest heaving. Why should he ever return?
Something wild and authentic in his blood beat in his brain.
Margaret, Vanessa, his mother, they were nothing to him because
he was not himself, Adam Paris, but something beyond himself,
beyond time, the past, the present and all that was to come.</p>

<p>He lay on the turf, the soil was in his beard, his hands dug
into the short sweet grass, the grit of the land, chilled,
hardened with a frost that had outlived the midday sun. He stood
up. Below him was Derwentwater to the east, Newlands to the west
veiled now in the shadow of the lengthening day. He saw
Catchedicam to the left of Helvellyn top, and southwards was
Langdale Pike o' Stickle. Why should he ever return? He started
to run again on a surface so buoyant that it seemed to run with
him. Up the easy slope of Maiden Moor, Scafell and Gable coming
to meet him between Eel Crag and Dale Head. Why should he ever
return? Borrowdale and Grange were below and now the Pillar was
in view between Dale Head and Hindscarth. He might race on for
ever--Hindscarth and Robinson, then down to Buttermere across to
Ennerdale, over to Waswater, to Eskdale and the sea!</p>

<p>He was a wandering man, a lost man, a man at last his own
master!</p>

<p>He shouted. 'Oh, hoi! Oh, hoi!' All the hills echoed him as it
seemed to him, and the waters of a thousand streams roared about
his ears.</p>

<p>He flung out his arms and embraced the world . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Folly! He sat down, hugging his knees. He brushed the soil
from his beard. He pulled up his trousers to see whether his knee
were bleeding. It was not. He could barely see the scratch. Two
sheep came wandering towards him and stood a little way off him,
watching. Then, reassured, began to graze again. The sun was
gone; it fell swiftly behind the hills on these January days.
Helvellyn burned in a haze of rosy smoke, and all the air was
frosty as though the ice had suddenly thickened on the Lake below
and the hills around him. Maiden Moor, Robinson were breathing in
gusts of cold thickened air. The sky paled to become the white
field of one solitary star that glittered, a spark of frosted
fire. Dusk and a great silence enwrapped the world.</p>

<p>He started home. The thought of home was comforting. Margaret
sitting by the fire, and he would tell Benjamin and Vanessa a
story . . .</p>

<p>He started down the slope, singing as he went.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c405">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A VERY OLD LADY</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>She rose and then sank again, sank and rose, on a great
billowy cloud of softest down. The movement was so exquisite, and
she was herself so lazy, that she abandoned herself completely,
although there were, she knew, a thousand things that she ought
to be doing. Everything, far and near, was of a dazzling white
save only Adam's nose that was purple and dripping with cold. Had
she the energy she would tell him that he must blow it. There was
the cloud available and it would irritate her, did she allow
herself to be irritated, that he did not make use of so
convenient a remedy. But she would not permit herself to be
irritated. She was altogether too happy. As she rocked she sang
softly to herself a song that Emma Furze had taught her, but she
would not sing loudly lest she should wake Georges who was
snoring on a cloud near by. How well she knew that snore--it was
part of her whole life--and although she did not care for snores
in general, Georges' snore was her own property and he must sleep
long, here in Watendlath, for yesterday had been the clipping and
he would be weary.</p>

<p>Moreover, just round the corner was the whole family--Dorothy,
Tim, Veronica, Amabel and dear Jane. They were busy at some game.
She could not quite see them, but she knew what they were about.
Practising at archery, as indeed they must, for in a week's time
there was the contest in Keswick and Veronica had a chance of a
prize. It was winter, but in visions such as this all seasons
were confused. How lovely she looked, Veronica, her body
stretched, her bow held straight from her arms, her beautiful
head thrown back! But Jane would be clumsy. If she were not
careful they would laugh and then Jane would blush, pretending
not to mind, but hurt at her clumsiness . . . and she would call
from her cloud, as so often she had done before, 'Jane! Jane! I
want you!' simply to save her.</p>

<p>Things began to press in upon her consciousness. A great white
bird, the sunlight glittering in silver on its sweeping wings,
flew slowly above her head, and the white blossom fell, at a
touch of the warm breeze, there across the lawn in the orchard,
the petals hovering, wavering . . . hovering, wavering! The
sheep, their fleece stained with red, were pressing up the road
at Watendlath, and Charlie Watson, motionless on his horse,
watched them go. There was something that she must say to Charlie
Watson, and so, raising herself from her cloud, she called softly
'Charlie! Charlie!'</p>

<p>The sky was blinded with a white radiance. The great bird,
shaking showers of brilliance from its wings, beat upwards
towards the sun. The radiance was so bright that she put her hand
before her eyes, crying out with joy at so much loveliness, then
heard--close beside here--Jane's eager laughing voice.</p>

<p>'Wake up, Aunt Judith! Look at the snow! It has fallen in the
night! There never was such a beautiful day!'</p>

<p>She turned her head, rubbed her eyes, then reached for her
spectacles. Putting them on she caught, in one sweep, the whole
of the real world, for Jane had drawn back the blinds and, from
her bed, she could see the flanks of Skiddaw glistening in
crystal snow, and snow heaped on the windowsill. Above it all,
there was a burning blue sky and the sun blazed over all the
room. Jane stood there with the basin of water, the sponge, the
soap, the towel, the silver brushes, the ivory comb, and, on a
table not far away, breakfast was waiting.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear,' she said with a little sigh of happiness.
'I've had a very good night, thank you. I woke once and heard it
strike three and that was the only time. Dear me, what a splendid
sunshine! And how are you, Jane dear? I hope you slept well. I
dreamt you were practising archery with Veronica.'</p>

<p>'I have had a very good night, thank you,' said Jane, and at
once she began, with a dexterity and neatness that Judith adored
(she would allow no one but Jane to perform these offices), to
hold the basin, to see that the sponge was not too full, and
then, when the washing was concluded, to bring the round mirror
with the green wood and the gilt doves, so that Judith might see
clearly to brush her silver hair.</p>

<p>'Mary will be in shortly to set the fire. There are plenty of
logs, I told James yesterday.'</p>

<p>'What is there for breakfast?'</p>

<p>The tray was brought to the bed and carefully arranged.</p>

<p>'I chose those two brown eggs myself. And there is the damson
preserve.'</p>

<p>'Dear me, how pleasant!'</p>

<p>'Adam is coming over today, you know.'</p>

<p>'As though I could forget, my dear.'</p>

<p>'He is bringing Vanessa.'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course,' Judith said, quite crossly. They would
treat her--even dear Jane did this--as though she found it
difficult to remember things. She remembered
everything--<i>everything.</i> It was true that it seemed to her
as though Georges and Charlie Watson were still in the room. Past
and Present were one and the same. Jane herself would discover
that one day. But because she, Judith, was ninety-five years of
age (she had had her birthday a week or two ago) was no reason
why they should think her helpless. It was true that she could
not, any longer, walk very much, but for the rest she was as
active and alive as any of them. She took off the top of one of
her eggs and said:</p>

<p>'How is everybody? How is Timothy's cold?'</p>

<p>'Bad. But he doesn't mind. He has ridden off to Orpen Farm to
see about the Hunt tomorrow. With the snow like this it will be
difficult, but it will thaw this afternoon, I dare say. It never
lies long here.'</p>

<p>Judith enjoyed her breakfast. Every morning as she drank her
tea and ate her toast and preserve, she considered her state. She
was no hypochondriac, but from a kind of outside consideration
she summoned her forces. Had she a headache? Did her eyes smart?
How was her throat which, a day or two ago, had been a little
sore? How was that sharp pain in the right elbow? And the
soreness just above the left knee? Was her stomach (which Dorothy
thought it most indelicate ever to mention) preparing to upset
her or was it lazy and good-natured today? (She saw her stomach
as a kind of cat, sometimes full of warm milk and purring,
sometimes in the worst of tempers, always selfish.)</p>

<p>But how was the Captain of her Ragged Army, her Heart?
Everything depended on her Heart. While she felt that her stomach
was definitely hostile, didn't care a rap about her, her Heart,
she considered, was on her side, disliked extremely to distress
her, would not miss a beat and then beat twice in a hurry if he
could help it. Her Heart was a Gentleman who was making the best
of it in very difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Although she held this review every morning she never spoke to
anyone about it. She could indeed carry on a perfect domestic
conversation with Jane at the very moment when she was saying
inside herself: 'Well, Knee, are you wishing to be tiresome
today? You are very quiet just now, but I dare say you've got
something up your sleeve for later on.'</p>

<p>And, behind all this, was her terrific pride at reaching her
present age. Every morning when she woke to find herself alive
she made another triumphant notch on the slate of her mind. It
soon might be--it might be indeed at any moment--that she would
slip into a stage of semi-consciousness when living would be
nothing but a dreaming preparation for Death. When that came she
would not be able to reckon her triumph, so now she would make
the most of it. On November 28th last, her ninety-fifth birthday,
she had had messages, letters, gifts, from Herries all over the
country--from Ellis and his mother, Janet and Roger at Grosset,
Stephen Newmark, Phyllis, Barnabas, Katherine (who had married
Colonel Winch of Forrest Hatch, Salisbury), Emily, from Garth and
Amery and Sylvia, from the Ormerods at Harrogate and the Cards at
Bournemouth, from all the Witherings near Carlisle--yes, from
Herries and Herries all the country over. They had all been kind
and generous, but she knew what it was that they had all been
thinking. She must reach her Hundredth Birthday! At all costs SHE
MUST LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED!</p>

<p>Not for many, many years--not in fact since old Maria Herries
who had been born on the day of the Battle of Naseby--had any
Herries come so near to a Hundred. Great-Aunt Maria had missed
it, and they were all disappointed even now, after all this time,
that she had done so.</p>

<p>But Judith was their pride and their hope. True that she had
not always been their pride, true that her father had been a
disgrace, that she herself had married a rascal of a Frenchman
who had died shamefully in a drunken scramble, that she had lived
like a farmer's wife in the country, that she had had an
illegitimate son, but that was all long ago. She had become a
famous person, a legend. All over the country Herries said: 'Oh
yes, we are a strong stock, live to a great age. There's old
Madame now, ninety something, and commands a houseful of women up
in Cumberland as though she were twenty. Wonderful old lady!
She'll reach her Century, you may be sure. Nothing can stop
her.'</p>

<p>Judith knew that they were saying this and she was proud of
it. Of course it was foolish, but then the Herries <i>were</i>
foolish--foolish and rather charming, in their childishness. When
she felt well, as on a morning like this present one, she thought
that she could live until two hundred. Why not? What was to stop
her? There <i>were</i> days when she was infinitely weary and
longed for it all to be over. But as soon as the bad days passed
she forgot them.</p>

<p>Today her mind was as clear as a crystal. She remembered
everything. Timothy's cold, the calf that had been born two
nights before, the new maid Hannah from Seathwaite, the proposal
that Captain Forster of Runner Hall, near Penrith, had made to
Veronica a week ago (would she accept him? She was thirty-one
years of age and had she not been so beautiful would have been
long thought an old maid), a chair that Dorothy had bought for
her in Carlisle (it was of hand-carved walnut and its seat was
covered in maroon plush; Judith had thought it hideous but did
not wish to hurt Dorothy's feelings), Adam's visit, a present of
a miniature set in Bristol jet ware (teapot, sugar-box and
cream-jug) that she had for Vanessa. Jane had found it in Keswick
and it was exactly what Vanessa loved . . . all these things she
had in mind while Jane talked and the snow glittered, the sun
flooded the room, and the damson preserve tasted most excellent .
. .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Afterwards she had her bath, warm and delicious, while the
logs blazed and the large tortoiseshell cat purred on the rug;
then Jane helped her to dress and at last she was seated in her
armchair near the fire ready for the Visits.</p>

<p>'I think, Jane dear, I'll be able to go downstairs a little
this afternoon!'</p>

<p>What a picture she made, Jane thought, in her black silk with
her snow-white cap, the lace at her throat and wrists, the thin
long gold chain that hung almost to her waist, her black shoes
with the glittering buckles!</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, I think you can on such a lovely day.' It was at
this moment when she was not so well, just before the Visits,
that she had to pull herself together, to drag herself up out of
that other world, the Watendlath world where Georges and Charlie
laughed and rode, where Christabel and Jennifer quarrelled before
a fantasy of masked figures, where an old man with a long white
beard stroked his nose . . . On her bad days that past was more
real than any present. But not today. She was all alert, and when
Dorothy, followed by Amabel, entered with their 'Isn't it a
beautiful day, Aunt Judith?' and Dorothy began at once, as was
her custom, with a cheerful 'tit-tat-tat-tit' of conversation
(her manner with very old people) Judith was all alive.</p>

<p>Dorothy was wearing a new dress, the upper skirt caught up
almost to the hips and the back of the skirt descending in a
straight sloping line from the waist to the ground. The upper
skirt was of brown silk and the lower of bright blue taffeta.
This suited her stoutness better than the old exaggerated
crinoline. Judith knew at once what the new dress meant.</p>

<p>'You are going into Keswick, my dear?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Veronica is coming with me. <i>What</i> do you think?
Veronica intends to accept Captain Forster!'</p>

<p>Here was news indeed! One less of the great virginal army! And
Captain Forster was not so bad. On the stout side and not very
clever, but devoted, with a charming place, money enough, a kind
heart. Veronica should have been in London. She might then have
married <i>anybody.</i> But she was lazy. There was something of
Jennifer in her blood. She had told Judith once that the only man
she had ever really loved had been a farmer from Buttermere way.
That had been only her fun. Of course Veronica would never think
of such a thing! But why not? Had not Charlie Watson been a
farmer?</p>

<p>Never mind. Here was Captain Forster--plump, clean,
adoring.</p>

<p>'Are you certain?'</p>

<p>'Well, she hasn't confessed it in so many words. But he is to
be at the Osmastons'. I am <i>sure</i> that she means to accept
him.'</p>

<p>Amabel, who was always dressed severely and thought men
contemptible, tossed her head.</p>

<p>'What she can see in that fat man!'</p>

<p>'Well, dear,' said Dorothy complacently, 'it is she that is
going to marry him, not you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, thank heaven.'</p>

<p>They talked for a little, then Dorothy said:</p>

<p>'We will leave you now because I think Elizabeth wants a word.
She is unhappy about Benjamin.'</p>

<p>'What has he been doing?'</p>

<p>Dorothy sighed.</p>

<p>'What hasn't he been doing? He had a fight in the village last
evening with Marston's boy, and his report from Rugby has come.
It is terrible, really terrible. You must speak to him, Aunt
Judith. You are the only one who can do anything with him.'</p>

<p>They went and Elizabeth came in.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was fifty-four and as beautiful now as she had been
at twenty. She wore a grey dress, her fair hair flat on the top
and gathered into a large bun at the back of her head, a golden
glory even in that so hideous fashion. She had the air of
remoteness that had been hers ever since John's death. She was
not priggish nor superior in this. She joined in everything that
went on, laughed, sang, played games, hunted (she was still a
splendid horsewoman), but nothing could bring her into the real
current of life that the others shared. She loved her son, she
loved Judith, she loved Jane, but even they, even Benjamin, were
shades compared with John. When he was killed she received a blow
that was mortal, and Judith, seeing her, knew that the Herries
battle was not yet over, and that the consequences of old
long-ago histories had still their own history to make.</p>

<p>But because of her own story she understood Elizabeth as did
none of the others. Her own Georges had suffered sudden death, as
had John, and for ten years after it she, too, had been herself a
dead woman. She had had the fears for Adam that Elizabeth now had
for Benjamin, but she had been spared because fate had chosen
John for its mark instead of Adam. All the more reason that she
should help Elizabeth now.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, sitting close beside her, began at once.</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith, we have had Benjamin's report, and it is
dreadful.'</p>

<p>'What does it say, my dear?'</p>

<p>'It says that we must take him away if he does not improve.
They acknowledge that he is clever but he will not work, he obeys
nobody. He is always fighting.'</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, he is a healthy boy and has to let himself go,
I suppose.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>

<p>'Yes, but he will obey nobody and he does not care. When I
speak to him he only smiles. He is not cruel nor selfish. In
fact, as you know, there never was a more generous boy. It is not
that he is absent-minded. He throws himself altogether into
anything that he is doing. But there is something <i>wild</i> in
him. He says he wants to be a gipsy!'</p>

<p>'A gipsy!'</p>

<p>'Yes. He wants to go away in a caravan and eat roasted
hedgehogs. Then . . . there is another thing . . .' She
hesitated. 'Two afternoons ago I saw him kissing Hannah; in the
passage under the backstairs. Of course it was nothing. He is
only a child--he is not yet fourteen and he is tremendously
honest. He conceals nothing. He says that he bet her a shilling
that he would kiss her . . . I am in despair. He is so merry,
always laughing and doing things for others--but he will listen
to nobody!'</p>

<p>'He kissed Hannah, did he?' said Judith, thinking how
different he was from his father John. And from her own Adam
too.</p>

<p>'Yes,' went on Elizabeth. 'I am sure, too, that it is my
fault. Aunt Judith, I have been wrong not to <i>force</i> my way
into Ireby. But I hated it so that time I went . . .'</p>

<p>(Two years before Elizabeth had gone to the Fortress, had
asked for her father, had suffered a fearful scene with Mrs
Pangloss who had refused her entry.)</p>

<p>'You know that I have written again and again and he has never
answered. But if I had gone and refused to be beaten by that
horrible woman and stayed with father whatever she did, I feel
that Benjamin would respect me more. He never speaks either of
his father or his grandfather. I don't know even now whether he
knows . . . whether he knows . . .'</p>

<p>She broke down, hid her head in her hands, then suddenly knelt
at Judith's feet, burying her head in Judith's lap. The old lady
gently stroked her hair. Even on her very alert days she had
moments of slipping off into a dream. Now with her hand on
Elizabeth's hair she saw the room filled with sparkling snow:
whorls of dancing crystal filled the air, which was shot with
splinters of golden sun. The windows had faded and a great sea of
virgin snow, upon whose breast waves of iridescence quietly
formed, broke and formed again, spread from the hills' horizon
there to her very feet. She was herself as light as a snowflake,
and it seemed to her that she had to exert especial power not to
float away on the current of that white loveliness and never be
seen again . . . Was this Death--and if it was so, why did men
fear it? So sweet, so friendly, so just . . .</p>

<p>'. . . You see, Aunt Judith,' Elizabeth's voice came like a
soft key closing a door, and the room swam back, the bed with the
hangings, the ugly chair that Dorothy had given her (oh, why had
she forgotten to thank her just now?), the sparkling buckles on
her own shoes. 'I seem to have no will-power any longer. I do
things with everyone else, but my real self is not here. It is
away with John. It is as though he were always whispering to me
things that I ought to do--be more firm with Benjie, live with
father and make him more comfortable. I had will-power once, but
John's death did something to me. Grief doesn't break your heart
as the novels say, but it takes your character away. I don't
<i>grieve</i> for John. I am sure that he is happier now than he
ever was here. But I am not alive. When you lost your husband did
you feel at all the same?'</p>

<p>'Yes, dear, I did. Just as you describe. For nearly ten years
I lived with the Rockages in Wiltshire and I had no real life at
all; but it comes back in the end. Nothing can kill you.
Nothing.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose from her knees and stood before the fire, her
long slim body irradiated by the leaping light, her soft grey
dress like a cloud against the sparkling logs.</p>

<p>'Aunt Judith,' she said. 'Do you believe in God?'</p>

<p>'I don't know.'</p>

<p>'You are not certain?'</p>

<p>'My dear, I have been a pagan all my life long. I know now
that everyone is very religious, and if you don't go to church on
Sunday it's very wrong, but in my young days it wasn't so. Going
to church is just a fashion, I think. At one time it's the thing
and at another it's not. My husband thought it foolish to believe
in anything you couldn't see, but a great friend of mine, Reuben
Sunwood, was as sure of God as I am of this room. For myself, now
I am so very old, there <i>seems</i> to be another world--but
that may be my old age and my body failing. On some days, you
know, my hearing is bad and I cannot see very well. Then I seem
to be in another world. But I don't know. When one loves someone
very much one seems to go beyond bodily things. When one's in a
bad temper or loses one's spectacles or the servants are tiresome
it's different.' She rapped her fingers impatiently on her
spectacle-case.</p>

<p>'Dear Elizabeth, you must pull yourself together a little
more. It is quite right what you say. Benjamin needs more
discipline. Send him to me, my dear. This morning. In the
afternoon I'm often sleepy.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth bent down and kissed the dry, withered cheek. How
<i>very</i> old Aunt Judith was! It was wrong to trouble her, but
then she liked to be troubled.</p>

<p>'If I can find him I'll send him to you now.'</p>

<p>When she was alone in the room again she gave a little sigh of
satisfaction. She liked to be alone, and she liked also to be in
the centre of things. She was happy this morning because neither
her heart nor her stomach troubled her, because it was a
beautiful day and because, old though she was, they still wished
to consult her. The world was whirring around her! Veronica would
marry Captain Forster, Benjamin was naughty, Adam would soon be
here . . . She arranged her spectacles on her nose, picked up
from the table at her side a number of the <i>Spectator</i> and
read its opinion of Mr Longfellow's <i>Hiawatha,</i> an old poem
now but still criticized with reverence: '<i>Mr Longfellow's</i>
Hiawatha <i>is one of the really permanent contributions to
modern literature, and no other genius known to us would have
been in any way equal to the work. It is not the grasp of
imagination, so much as the grace and sweep of a peculiarly
majestic</i> fancy<i>--a</i> <i>fancy like the impulsive fancy of
children . . . How bright and playful is the picture of the lower
animals with the little Indian prophet . . . But it is not only
in the details, it is in the whole spirit of the poem--the
fanciful joy and beauty, the equally fanciful weirdness and
gloom--that we enjoy the touch of a master hand.'</i></p>

<p>Well, that was very nice for Mr Longfellow. But she was not
sure. The writer used the word 'fanciful' a great many times.
That was perhaps a warning. In any case she could not read for
very long in these days--Jane read to her every afternoon--a
lengthy poem, read aloud . . . No, she thought she would not
bother with <i>Hiawatha.</i></p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, and Benjamin came in. He was
shooting up; he was no longer the small chubby child. He would
not be a handsome man, although he had fine clear eyes, a
splendid colour, and a strong stocky body. As usual he seemed to
be enjoying a joke of some kind. She could see that he knew that
he had come to be scolded and was endeavouring to be grave.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Benjie? Come over here where I can see you.'</p>

<p>He came and stood beside the chair in the attitude of
straitened attention that children must observe before their
elders. His cheeks were flushed with the cold and his hair was in
disorder. He tried to arrange it with his hand. He looked her in
the face, giving her all his mind, not as Adam had so often done
when he was small, thinking of something else.</p>

<p>'Now, Benjie, I have sent for you because they tell me that
your report has come from Rugby and it is shocking. They say that
you will be sent away if you do not behave better. Your mother is
very unhappy. What have you to say?'</p>

<p>What had he to say? How very, <i>very</i> old Aunt Judith was!
And so small and so tidy. There came from her a pleasant scent of
exquisite cleanliness and the smell of some flower, a carnation
perhaps. But what must it be like to be as old as that? Why, her
father had been born at the very beginning of the eighteenth
century! There wasn't a boy at Rugby who had a relation as old as
this! Something to be proud of. He pulled himself together and
tried to attend. He always attended to the thing in hand, and the
thing in hand at the moment was that Aunt Judith was going to
scold him about his report. He didn't mind. He liked her. He
liked everybody.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry, Aunt Judith.'</p>

<p>She kicked one shoe impatiently.</p>

<p>'Yes, but that is not enough. You must do something about it.
You are a big boy now and threaten to be a disgrace to us
all.'</p>

<p>She looked at him and her heart melted within her. She
worshipped small boys, and although Benjie was very different
from her own Adam, he had Adam's independence. She adored
independence.</p>

<p>'Why are you so naughty?'</p>

<p>'There are so many rules and they teach you such silly
things.'</p>

<p>It was the tradition in England that all children obeyed
absolutely their parents, did nothing that their parents didn't
wish them to do, were preparing, one and all, to be the heroes
and heroines of the future. But Benjie seemed unaware of the
tradition.</p>

<p>'You know you belong to a very fine family,' she began, 'and,
when you grow up, everyone will expect you to make your family
proud of you.'</p>

<p>'I know. They are always talking about the family, but I don't
see why I should think about the family. I'm myself, aren't
I?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but--'</p>

<p>'When you were a little girl you ran away. Your father was
always against the family. My grandfather shot himself in London
and my father was killed, when he couldn't defend himself, by my
uncle. I'm not like the rest of the family. I'm different and
I'll always be different. Mother and Aunt Veronica and Aunt
Amabel and Ellis and Cousin Amery--<i>they</i> are the family.
But I'm different. I'm by myself.'</p>

<p>Her heart began to beat furiously. Her eyes dimmed. She could
have caught the boy to her and kissed him. And with that odd
exaltation (so bad for her heart) was fear also. Would this
battle <i>never</i> be ended? She seemed for an instant to behold
her father, whom she had never seen, standing, erect, triumphant,
against the snow . . .</p>

<p>She beat down her emotion and in a voice that trembled a
little said: 'Yes, but, Benjie, you must understand that being
different is <i>not</i> amusing--not amusing at all. It seems to
you, I daresay, very splendid to stand up now and say "I'm
different", but I'm a very old woman and have had great
experience and I can tell you that the world does not like people
to be different, and especially our family does not. You can't
know yet how powerful the world is and how <i>right</i> the world
is too, because if everyone was independent and refused to suit
themselves to the world's rules, nothing would ever be done. My
father learnt that, I have learnt it, your grandfather learnt it.
You <i>have</i> to do as you are told unless you want to fight
all your life long.'</p>

<p>'I do like to fight,' he broke in eagerly. 'You see, Aunt
Judith, I think it's stupid to do things just because other
people do them.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but do you never think of others? You must see how
selfish it is always to have your own way. You can see how
unhappy you make your mother--'</p>

<p>'But I don't <i>want</i> to make her unhappy. I don't want to
make anyone sorry for what I do. They needn't be, only half the
time they are glad they are sorry.'</p>

<p>She had nothing to say. She was on his side, so terribly on
his side, and yet it would never do if he were disgraced at Rugby
. . .</p>

<p>'Well, then,' she said as though some silent comprehending
confidence had passed between them. 'You must promise me to do
your best for the sake of those who love you--for your mother's
sake and mine. Will you promise?'</p>

<p>He smiled, staring straight into her eyes. She really was a
<i>dear</i> old lady and he was proud of her because she had
lived to so great an age. He nodded.</p>

<p>'All right, Aunt Judith. I'll try.'</p>

<p>'And you won't fight?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know . . . I can't promise if another boy goes
for me--'</p>

<p>'You won't be the first in any case?'</p>

<p>'It's so hard often to tell who <i>is</i> the first. You
see--' But this was too technical.</p>

<p>'Kiss me then. And I shall expect a good report next
term.'</p>

<p>He kissed her. How dry her cheek was! Towards the door he
turned.</p>

<p>'There's one thing,' he said. 'Why do I never see my
grandfather?'</p>

<p>'Your grandfather?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Up at the Fortress.'</p>

<p>'He is very ill and sees nobody. He was very unkind to your
mother once, you know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but that was years ago. You can't go on remembering
things for ever, can you? I shall go one day and see him.'</p>

<p>Then he came back to her chair and, grinning, said: 'Aunt
Judith, would you like to see my ferret?'</p>

<p>'A ferret? Oh, I don't like ferrets.'</p>

<p>'You would this one. It's grand. James gave it me.'</p>

<p>'Very well. You can bring it one day.'</p>

<p>He nodded and went humming out.</p>

<p>The talk had affected her deeply. She took off her spectacles,
wiped her eyes, put them on again. Her heart was beating oddly.
It was not good for her to be agitated, but what was she to do
when all the old questions, so long answered and dismissed, came
surging up again?</p>

<p>When Jane brought her her dinner she found her greatly
excited. She had her favourite dinner--fried sole,
apple-pudding--but now she did not care. The talk with Benjamin
had, although it was so short, exhausted her: old terrors and
alarms would surround her and hem her in, did she allow them.</p>

<p>'I don't think I'll come down this afternoon after all, Jane
dear. I'm a trifle tired.'</p>

<p>'You have seen too many people, that's what it is,' Jane said
firmly. She had the air a little, as she arranged the silver dish
containing the apple-pudding in front of Judith, of a witch or a
fairy, someone from another and slightly inhuman world. She was
growing into that especial product of the British Isles, the
queer old maid, someone enterprising, eccentric, kindly, and very
much alone. Jane would be eccentric, she would suddenly snap her
fingers, dress quaintly (she was wearing now a funny old black
velvet jacket), roll her bread at a mealtime into little pellets,
talk to herself, but she had a heart as rich and warm as any
fairy godmother. She loved Judith with a passion that was almost
unholy. Although she was religious, virtuous and indeed prudish,
she would have committed any crime for Judith, married anyone,
killed anyone, stolen from anyone. So now she realized that
Judith was weary and had added in a moment, as old people do,
twenty years to her age. An hour ago she had been seventy, now
she was ninety, soon, if one were not careful, she would be a
hundred and ten.</p>

<p>'Yes, I don't think I'll go down . . . Jane, what do
<i>you</i> think of Benjamin?'</p>

<p>'He is a fine boy. I love him!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, of course!' She knocked her silver spoon against
the plate. 'We all love him, but I am afraid that he is a very
naughty boy.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he has fights, but so do all proper boys.'</p>

<p>'Jane, why don't you marry someone?'</p>

<p>Jane blushed. She said almost in a whisper: 'I don't like
men--not in that way.'</p>

<p>'Dear, dear!' said Judith. (She was beginning to recover.) 'It
was a very nice way. Everyone is so prudish now that they are
ashamed to talk of going to bed with a man. It's perfectly
natural. Nothing to be ashamed of. But although they won't speak
of it they think of nothing else. It's all the same whoever it
is--Mrs Osmaston, Helen Withering, Mrs James Anstruther. How
shall we marry our daughters? We must put our girls to bed with a
man the first possible opportunity, do everything we can, dress
them so as to accentuate their figures, throw them at every man
we see, everything to marry them--but speak of what happens when
they <i>are</i> married--oh, dear me, no!'</p>

<p>Jane disliked it when Judith talked like this. She did wish
that she wouldn't.</p>

<p>'Now, there's Dorothy! In <i>such</i> a flutter this morning
because Veronica is going to marry. She'd marry Amabel to
<i>anybody</i> if only somebody would have her, but a pestle and
mortar is the only thing Amabel will ever marry. Yes--well, that
pudding was very good. I think I'll have my nap now so as to be
ready for Adam.'</p>

<p>When Adam came she was quite ready for him. Her nap had
refreshed her. The afternoon sun shone into the room like the
reflection from a pale cloud of gold. The eaves were dropping
with the heat of the sun and, when her spectacles were on, she
could see blue shadows on Skiddaw. There was a strange mountain
lightness over everything, and the logs in the fireplace were
crimson with heat, and crackled like mad. As soon as Adam came
in, sat beside her, took her hand, they were enclosed as though
there were no one else in the world.</p>

<p>She wanted to talk about the Trades Unions. She had had a
letter from Horace Newmark, who was in business in Manchester.
'He is as proud of all the chimneys as though they were
bluebells,' she said. 'He says Manchester is nothing but smoke
and dirt and it's grand. It's making England what it is, the
mistress of the world. Stuff! Who wants to be mistress of the
world? So like a Herries!'</p>

<p>Two years before, a man called Broadhead in Sheffield had, it
was proved, paid for men who had rebelled against his Union to be
murdered, and had paid out of the funds of the Union of which he
was secretary. The tyranny of 'rattening' whereby noxious
workers' tools were destroyed, women were blinded, men were shot
at, was prevalent, and in Manchester, among the brick-makers, the
clay which offending brick-makers were to use was sometimes
stuffed with thousands of needles in order to maim the hands of
those who worked on it. But the investigations into these crimes
had proved, too, that many of the conditions of work were
iniquitous and had remained unaltered since the days of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Judith was greatly interested. 'What do you think, Adam? What
about these Trades Unions?'</p>

<p>'I think they are necessary. The more England becomes an
industrial country--and she <i>is</i> now the first industrial
country in the world--the greater the power of the working-man.
He will rule England one day, mark my words, and I hope he'll be
wise enough to know what to do with the power when he has it.
That was the trouble with the Chartists. They weren't wise enough
nor clever enough. But in fifty years' time there'll be few big
families left. Everything will be shared--and quite right
too.'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Judith said. 'England was very nice once when
there were no railways and no chimneys. Isn't it strange? I've
been in a sedan-chair and saw a boy hung in the streets of
London. Yes, and bears were baited, and I've danced at Vauxhall.
I feel sleepy. It's the fire. Where is Vanessa?'</p>

<p>'Vanessa is downstairs with Benjamin.'</p>

<p>'And how is Cat Bells?'</p>

<p>'Cat Bells is covered with snow.'</p>

<p>'And how is dear Margaret?'</p>

<p>'Margaret sent her love and is coming soon to see you. She is
baking today and Will is helping her.'</p>

<p>'It all sounds very pleasant. And how are you yourself?'</p>

<p>'I am very well.'</p>

<p>'And the book?'</p>

<p>'Nearly finished.'</p>

<p>'It's not a fairy story this time.'</p>

<p>'No, it's about two boys at the North Pole.'</p>

<p>'What do you know about the North Pole? You've never been
there.'</p>

<p>'No. That's why I know so much about it.'</p>

<p>'But how can you write about what you've never seen?'</p>

<p>'There are two sorts of writers, Mother, just as there are two
sorts of Herries. One sort believes in facts, the other sort
believes in things behind the facts.'</p>

<p>'The books I like best,' she answered, 'are those that have
both sorts in them.'</p>

<p>'For instance?'</p>

<p>'Jane is reading me a very amusing story called <i>Under Two
Flags.</i> It's silly, of course--not like real life at all--but
most enjoyable. And then there's <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> And
then there's Mr Huxley's <i>Man's Place in Nature</i>.'</p>

<p>Adam laughed. 'Mother, what a ridiculous mixture!'</p>

<p>'They all come to the same thing in the end.'</p>

<p>'What thing?'</p>

<p>'The world is made up both of fancy and reality, I suppose. Oh
dear, I don't know . . . Adam, now that I cannot move from this
house I can see how <i>nice</i> England is.'</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>'Yes. I know you say "Foolish old woman at her age to love
anything with a passion." But I am not senile. The moment I'm
senile, Adam, you shall drop a pill into my chicken-broth and
finish me off. No, I am very wide awake, and I can see that all
my life I've loved England. Why do you not write a book about
England?'</p>

<p>'How would <i>you</i> do it, Mother?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I would put in everything--men sowing the fields, the
horses ploughing, old ladies selling sweets in the village shop,
Mr Disraeli with his oily hair and Mr Gladstone with his collar,
Horace's Manchester chimneys, all the Herries thinking
<i>they've</i> made England, my father riding up Borrowdale, the
snow on Skiddaw, the apple-pudding I had at dinner, sheep on a
hill, the man lighting the lamps in Hill Street--and you, Adam,
running by Charlie's horse in Watendlath, at Chartist meetings in
London, writing stories at Cat Bells . . .' She broke off, her
finger to her lip. 'That gives me an idea--I have an idea!'</p>

<p>'What idea?'</p>

<p>'No matter. I shall tell you when it has got further on. Dear
me, I've talked such a deal today. One day I talk; another day
not a word. Sometimes I sleep all day. I'm ninety-five, you
know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. You're always telling me.'</p>

<p>She took his arm and, quickly, shyly caught his hand and
kissed it.</p>

<p>'My whole life has been you and Georges.'</p>

<p>'You said it was England.'</p>

<p>'You <i>are</i> both England to me. We are sunk in the
country, you and I, up to our necks. That's why I am so strong.
Do you know, Adam, I have never had a day's illness in my life?
Even when I was bearing you I was only ill for an hour or
two--ugh!--that was horrid. There was an elephant . . .'</p>

<p>He drew his chair closer, bent over her and put his arm round
her.</p>

<p>'Are you sure you are not tired?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed . . . I was a little but I had a nap. I can go to
sleep whenever I wish. Oh yes, I remember! Benjamin! Adam, what
do you think of Benjamin?'</p>

<p>'A grand boy--brave, generous. He will do fine things.'</p>

<p>'I am not so sure. He has had a dreadful report from
Rugby.'</p>

<p>'All the best boys have.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but he was in here this morning and I scolded him, and
he said that he didn't care because he was different from other
boys, different because of his father and his grandfather.'</p>

<p>Adam nodded. 'Yes, he told me that once too. But that's all
right. It's only that he feels wild sometimes. Why, I feel wild
myself at times, Mother. A year or two ago I went mad and ran up
Cat Bells--thought I would never come back.'</p>

<p>She smiled. 'I am delighted that you are wild still sometimes.
I thought you were so contented that you'd never be wild again.
If I had the strength I'd climb out of the window now just as I
did when I was a child. Is Vanessa wild?' she asked.</p>

<p>He sighed. 'Vanessa is an angel. But I am sometimes troubled.
She is so generous, so trusting, and believes in everyone.'</p>

<p>'Well, there is no harm in that as a beginning.'</p>

<p>'No, but she must suffer . . . Oh well, we all suffer. She
adores Benjie. He is her God at present.'</p>

<p>'Can I see her?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I will go and fetch her.'</p>

<p>He went quickly from the room. She thought--Benjamin, Vanessa,
the new generation, and I shall be gone . . . soon I shall be
gone. How strange and how familiar that thought that this room,
her old companion, would continue with Skiddaw beyond the window,
the snow falling, and she not here to see it, to move the chairs,
dust the china, put a log on the fire . . . She looked at the
table where was the parcel of the miniature teaset. She'll like
that, she thought. She had always adored giving presents. Adam
came in, bringing Vanessa with him. Vanessa was ten and tall for
her age. She was wearing a dress of red taffeta, and her little
skirt stood out stiffly. She had beautiful legs and arms, and her
head with its black hair was carried with a wonderful dignity for
so young a child. She came and made a curtsy, then she kissed the
old lady, then waited patiently, smiling.</p>

<p>'I have a present for you, my dear.'</p>

<p>Vanessa's whole body was transformed with joy. You could see
that her heart was beating with excitement; she compressed her
lips so that she should not burst out into indecorous cries.</p>

<p>'Yes . . . Bring me that parcel, darling.'</p>

<p>She brought it very carefully. It was unwrapped. She knelt
down on the floor so that she could see the wonder. She picked up
each tiny piece, the teapot, the cups, the saucers, and held
them, one by one, against the light.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said slowly. 'It is the loveliest . . . Oh, Aunt
Judith! . . . I never thought . . . I never expected . . .' Then
she reached out for her father's hand. He pulled her to her feet.
Even now, with all her joy, she controlled herself. She
remembered how old Aunt Judith was, she kissed her tenderly and
with great care. Then she stared at the precious things as though
she would never take her eyes away.</p>

<p>'Do you like them?'</p>

<p>'<i>Like</i> them!' She curtsied again, then turned to the
window as though her feelings were so great that she must hide
them. Once again the three of them had the sense that they were
enclosed, away from all the world, rapt into a private communion
of happiness.</p>

<p>'I must show them to Benjie,' she said.</p>

<p>Judith nodded. 'Yes, show them to Benjie. And come again and
say goodnight before you go.'</p>

<p>'I will be off too,' Adam added. 'I will help her to carry the
tea-things.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said his mother, her sharp eyes staring with some
secret excitement. 'And send Jane to me if you can find her. My
idea! My idea! I must go on with my idea!'</p>

<p>She tapped impatiently on the silk of her dress.</p>

<p>'Tell Jane I want her at once. <i>At once</i>--whatever she
may be at!'</p>

<p>Jane arrived, quite breathless. She had been washing Dorothy's
bitch Maria, an old and sulky spaniel who was washed every
Thursday, come what might: and today was Thursday, Dorothy was in
Keswick, and there was no one else . . .</p>

<p>'I've left Hannah to finish her!'</p>

<p>'Now sit down and get your breath.'</p>

<p>'What is it, Aunt Judith? Adam says you have an idea.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have . . . Look in that wardrobe near the window, and
among those bundles of letters you will find a manuscript book in
a dark-green leather cover. Yes--that fat one . . . Now you have
it? There's not a word in it, is there? No, I thought not.
Francis gave it to me years ago on a birthday. He thought the
dark-green leather handsome. Now bring the little writing bureau
closer. That's it. Near the fire so that you will be warm and
will hear what I say. Excellent. Have you a pen that suits you?
Now listen, my dear. I was talking to Adam about England. You
know old ladies talk and talk until they are quite exhausted. I
have often noticed it--the older you are the more you talk. Dear
Pennyfeather at Keswick was like that. Her last years you could
<i>not</i> stop her . . . a constant flow. Well, now I intend to
talk to some purpose. Adam and I said we love England and so we
do. Then I had an idea. You know I never saw either my father or
my mother, but my half-brother David--he was old enough to be my
father, you know--would often, before he died, poor man, tell me
stories of them. He liked to take me for a walk, or we would ride
to Bassenthwaite or Caldbeck or to the Dash, and all the way
there and back he would tell me about the old days and my
father.</p>

<p>'Now I think that I should write it down--or rather that
<i>you</i> should, Jane dear. I may die at any moment. Oh yes, I
may--of course I may--and what a pity! All this lost for ever. No
one knows it but I. And that was a very odd life my father lived
in Borrowdale. David told me that he remembered exactly the night
they first arrived in Keswick. No, but wait. You shall write it
down. Do not you think it a good idea, Jane?'</p>

<p>The old lady was so eager and excited that it would have been
cruelty to prevent her. But Jane did not wish to prevent her. She
was herself greatly interested in that world and in that very
strange man, her great-great-grandfather. How very curious that
the <i>father</i> of Aunt Judith sitting there so comfortably
before the fire should be her own great-great-grandfather! It was
like stepping on to a magic carpet and swinging back into another
fairy-world. So she took her pen and began to write in the
dark-green leather book.</p>

<p>'Now tell me, dear, if I go too fast. Well, you'd better begin
in this way. "I, Judith Paris, was born at Rosthwaite in the
valley of Borrowdale, Cumberland, on November 28th, in the Year
of Our Lord 1774 . . ." There! Have you got that? That's a good
solid beginning, I think, rather like Macaulay's <i>History.</i>
Now to continue. "I never knew my dear father and mother because
they both died on the day I was born, and had I not been found
and rescued from the cold by Squire Gauntry of Stone Ends, who
happened to be riding past that day and heard me crying, I should
undoubtedly have perished."</p>

<p>'Have you got that, Jane?' She peered over her spectacles on
the very edge of her nose. 'Let me see, my dear. Yes, you write
very nicely. Am I going too fast for you?'</p>

<p>'Not at all, Aunt Judith. How very interesting this will
be!'</p>

<p>'I hope so. I certainly think it may. Well, to continue. "It
is not, however, my own history about which I write, but rather
about some of the early days that my father spent in the valley
of Borrowdale. My father himself lived to a good age, and I
myself am now a very old woman, so that I am a link with the
long-ago past. I have heard very much of what happened in those
long-ago times from my half-brother David Herries. David Herries
was my father's son by his first wife, and he was fifty-five when
I was born, so that I could have been his granddaughter. He was
very famous as a young man as a boxer and wrestler and runner. He
had great strength as a younger man, but when I knew him he had
grown stout and was living very happily with his family at
Uldale, where I also was living. He would take me for walks and
rides, and it was then that he would tell me these stories.</p>

<p>'"He told me that he remembered exactly the night that he
first arrived in Keswick. He could remember every detail, and so
do I, even at this distance of time. How he was in the inn at
Keswick in a big canopied bed with his sisters Mary and Deborah.
The canopy that ran round the top of the bed was a faded green
and had a gold thread in it. There were fire-dogs by the fire
with mouths like grinning dragons. And he remembered that a woman
was sitting warming herself in front of the fire, a woman he
hated. Then his father came in and thought he was sleeping. He
remembered that his father was wearing a beautiful coat of a
claret colour and a chestnut wig, and there were red roses on his
grey silk waistcoat. He remembered, too, that his father said
something to the woman by the fire that made her very angry, and
she began to talk in a loud, heated voice."'</p>

<p>Jane went on, and in that clear little voice like a bell
Judith refashioned this old world to her, describing the inn and
the servants running hither and thither with candles, some
relations who had a meal with them, and how David's uncle wanted
to make him drink wine and he would not. Then the dark mysterious
night-ride to Borrowdale, and how he sat on the horse in front of
his father and how proud he was, and his father asked him whether
he were frightened, and he answered bravely that he was never
frightened where his father was. How then they came to a house on
a little hill and David ran forward and was in the house first,
and there were two shining suits of armour in the hallway.</p>

<p>'There,' said Judith suddenly. 'I am tired. That will be
enough for today. I think you shall help me to bed.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt Judith,' said Jane. 'That <i>is</i>
interesting!'</p>

<p>But Aunt Judith was weary. She had suddenly collapsed, her
head nodded, she yawned and yawned and was almost helpless in
Jane's hands as she undressed her. It was dark now beyond the
window; a faint powdery blue framed the silent masses of snow;
some stars, lonely in that cold sky, were like sparks blown up
from a fire. Jane drew the cherry-coloured curtains. She saw that
Judith was propped up with pillows and two candles lit by her
side (how tiny and soft her body had been--like a child's), then
she left the room to return with some tea, a small sponge-cake
and some raspberry jam in a blue glass saucer. Then, most
unfortunately, Aunt Judith lost her temper. It had been a tiring
day, there had been something too exciting about that dropping
back into the past--the past that was not only the past, but the
present and future as well.</p>

<p>So she lost her temper over the sponge cake. It was a plum
cake that she had wanted. Dorothy only yesterday had promised her
a plum cake.</p>

<p>'But, Aunt Judith, it is not good for you. Doctor Bettany said
that plum cake was too rich--'</p>

<p>'Doctor Bettany never said anything of the kind.'</p>

<p>'But indeed he did!'</p>

<p>'So I am a liar! Thank you, dear Jane. I am glad I know.'</p>

<p>'No, of course not. But you know that last time you were
upset--'</p>

<p>'I was not upset!' She was trembling, her eyes were filled
with hot tears of anger. She was in a rage, so that for tuppence
she would have taken the teatray and thrown it and its contents
all over the room. How dare Jane say that she was a liar! And she
hated this soft soppy sponge cake! They thought they could do
what they liked with her! She was so good to them all, and yet
they tried to starve her! After listening all day to their
troubles they could so ill-treat her!</p>

<p>She took the sponge cake and with a shaking hand threw it into
the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>At the same moment Adam and Vanessa came in to say goodbye,
and with them were Dorothy and Veronica back from their party.
But Judith did not care. She was not ashamed. They should see
whether they could bully her.</p>

<p>'You promised me plum cake!' she cried to Dorothy.</p>

<p>'Oh, I am so sorry! . . . Aunt Judith, Veronica is engaged to
be married! Captain Forster--'</p>

<p>'I don't care! You think you can do what you like with me, all
of you, just because I am an old woman--'</p>

<p>But the sight of Veronica's beautiful happy face was too much
for her.</p>

<p>'Oh, well . . . Come here, my dear, and give me a kiss! There!
That's right! Don't spill the tea-things! What did he say to you?
Did he go down on his knees? Were you very gracious? . . .'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A long while after as it seemed to her, the room dark save for
the flicker from the fire, she lay there, very happy, on the edge
of sleep. It had been a wonderful day. She had never left that
room, but all the world had come into it. The elderly Dorothy,
Adam, Elizabeth, with all their personal histories hot about
them, and the young, Veronica engaged to be married, dear Jane so
sweet and good, and the children, Vanessa and Benjamin. All the
generations! They had come to her for advice and help and to tell
her what they were doing. They had wanted to know what she
thought. They could not get on without her.</p>

<p>She herself had welcomed the sun, eaten delightful food, read
a little, given a present, discussed serious matters like God and
the Trades Unions with Adam and Elizabeth, sunk back into the
past, thought of Georges and Warren and Adam as a baby, and then
gone behind that again to her own childhood and dear David, and
then back beyond that to a hundred and forty years ago when her
father had been a young man and worn a claret-coloured coat--all
this without leaving her room, all within a day. And she was
ninety-five. All the Herries all over England were waiting to see
her grow to a hundred!</p>

<p>Well, she would. Nothing was going to stop her! How could she
possibly disappoint such a great number of kind relations?</p>

<p>So, in that happy thought, she slipped away and once again was
rocking on that billowing cloud of softest down. She rose and
then sank again, sank and rose . . . Georges was sleeping near to
her. He was snoring with that snore so familiar to her that it
was also hers. All about them the world was of a dazzling white,
shining with a million crystals.</p>

<p>She rose and then sank again, sank and rose . . .</p>

<h1><a name="c406">AT VICTORINE'S</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In London, a boy aged fifteen stood on an October afternoon
pressing his nose to the window of a house in Hill Street. This
boy was young Benjamin Herries.</p>

<p>This was the day, the evening, the night of his life, for on
this day, October 14th, 1870, he was to become a man.</p>

<p>It had all happened in the most surprising manner, and the
cause of it had been the death, one evening while he was drinking
his tea, of old Stephen Newmark. Everyone had been expecting him
to die for years, but with that priggish obstinacy characteristic
of him he had refused to go, degenerating into a tiresome silent
old gentleman with a female nurse of whom, in the opinion of the
family, he was much too fond.</p>

<p>Poor Phyllis had predeceased him by some years; as he was not
a Herries no one had very much interest in his attaining a great
age. He died in the act of pronouncing one of his almost hourly
anathemas on Mr Disraeli.</p>

<p>Most unexpectedly it was decided that young Benjamin must be
present at his funeral. It seemed that Stephen had a great regard
for Elizabeth and had declared that 'he would do something for
her boy one day'. So Benjamin had been sent for from Rugby (where
he still survived, much to his own astonishment); Lady Herries
had invited him to stay in Hill Street for the funeral, and here
he was.</p>

<p>The funeral, two days before, had been great fun. Everything
was great fun for Benjamin, and he could not be expected to feel
much grief for Stephen Newmark, whom he had rarely seen.
Moreover, he noticed that Stephen's children were not greatly
downcast, and his own close friend Barney made no pretence of
sorrow.</p>

<p>'The Governor never liked me,' he confided to Benjamin on the
way to the funeral. 'He disapproved of me altogether and never
even looked at my novels. I don't blame him for that, but I'm not
going to be a crocodile about it. I leave that to sister
Emily.'</p>

<p>Lady Herries, who was now a rather ancient and (in Benjamin's
opinion) a very silly lady, did the honours with much
satisfaction, and Ellis Herries, already a man of importance in
the world of affairs, was dignified and solemn. Benjamin had got
considerable pleasure out of his days in town. He had never
really stayed in London before.</p>

<p>He had had a number of projects. Why should he return to
Rugby? He thought of being a stowaway in some vessel chartered
for the West Indies or (his old cherished dream) joining some
gipsies somewhere. He took a liking to an Italian organ-grinder,
with whom he talked in Berkeley Square, and fancied that he might
buy a barrel-organ. But his principal notion was that, if he
could get money enough, he would escape to France and, in some
way, slip into Paris and enjoy a bit of the Siege. He had
followed, with eager excitement, the Franco-Prussian War from its
commencement. He had cut out from the illustrated papers pictures
of the Emperor, Bismarck, MacMahon, Palikao, Bazaine, Frossard,
the young Prince Imperial, and many of the Empress. He was in
love with the Empress; he would be delighted to die for her. He
wanted nothing but to run on some mission for her, be shot in the
discharge of it and fall dying at her feet. He could not
understand why his companions at Rugby were on the whole so
indifferent.</p>

<p>Then, with the catastrophe at Sedan, his whole soul was on
fire. He learnt every detail of the battle by heart. He knew the
exact positions of Bazeilles and Balan, of the Donchery bridge,
where were the Villa Beurmann, Illy, and the fatal spot where the
Prussian Guards crossed the Givonne. He was sure that, had he
been in command, he would not have fallen into so complete a
trap, and the moment when the Emperor, old and sick, cried out
'The firing must be stopped at all costs!' was, for him, a real
agonizing piece of personal experience.</p>

<p>He hated and detested the Prussians; he adored the French, and
Barney, listening to him, was amazed that so young and jolly a
boy could feel so intensely. When he read how the Empress,
escaping from Paris, hailed a cab and was recognized by a street
urchin, he drew a deep breath as though he himself had only just
missed a great peril.</p>

<p>And now that Paris was invested it was for him as though he
himself shared the siege. When he heard how, on October 7th,
Gambetta escaped from Paris in a balloon he shouted 'Hurray!' and
gave all his pocket-money towards a dormitory feast in its
celebration. However, here he was now in London, and his own
immediate affairs demanded a lot of attention. Tomorrow he was to
return to Rugby, and he had a sad feeling that he <i>would</i>
return instead of making use of this magnificent opportunity of
adventure. Indeed, had it not been for his mother and Aunt
Judith, he would have certainly tried the stowaway adventure. But
they would grieve, although why they should he could not
understand. But women were queer and these two women he did not
wish to hurt. Moreover, Aunt Judith was so <i>very</i> old. He
had better wait until she was gone.</p>

<p>Then, this very morning, after breakfast, Barney had arrived
at Hill Street and, pulling Benjamin aside, had whispered to him
that he intended that evening to take Ellis and himself out to
dinner. 'Not a word to a soul,' he confided. 'Emily and the
others would make a terrible row if they knew. But we must do
something. These last days have been too gloomy for
anything.'</p>

<p>So Benjamin stood at the window, all ready dressed, waiting
for Barney to arrive.</p>

<p>It was the bewitching hour when the lamp-lighter has gone his
way and the lamps star the streets like nectarines. A faint wisp
of fog--having in it to Benjie's excited nostrils a slight sniff
of gunpowder (he was thinking possibly of Paris); from beyond the
window came magical sounds of London, the clop-clop of a horse,
the rattle of wheels, feet mysteriously echoing, the distant
plaintive murmur of a barrel-organ. On the top of area steps
belonging to the house opposite a housemaid was entertaining, for
a moment, a policeman. A brougham was waiting a few doors away
and down the steps came a stout, pompous, old gentleman,
pilloried in starch, a red shaven face and a white waistcoat and
white gloves that seemed to Benjie too big for him. The fog
increased a little, the lamps spread into a hazy iridescence,
some old man in a large and battered high hat came slowly down,
ringing a bell and calling out something in a melancholy voice, a
carriage rolled by with two footmen in cocked hats standing up at
the back of it--and always that soft rumble of sound as of a fat,
comfortable nurse singing lullaby to her children.</p>

<p>His excitement was intense; it was all that he could do not to
jump about the room, turn his favourite somersault. But Lady
Herries or Emily Newmark might come in at any moment. He thought
them safe and secure in the great cold draughty drawing room
upstairs. But you never could be sure. Grown-up people were
always creeping about and opening doors unexpectedly, like that
old beast Turker' Evans, head of his House at Rugby. His thoughts
were oddly jumbled. It was a pity that Ellis was coming; it would
be very much pleasanter without him. Not that he disliked Ellis,
or he would not did he not patronize him. Of course Ellis was
<i>years</i> older, a grown-up man who did business every day in
the City. And he was very kind. He had given Benjie ten shillings
only yesterday, but, for some dim obscure reason, Benjie would
rather not have taken it. Ellis did not really like him--not
<i>really,</i> as Barney and Adam Paris and Thornton Minor and
James at Uldale liked him. And then again, looking out at the
lamps and the misty street, suppose there was no God as Barney
said. Barney had sprung this astonishing piece of news upon him
at the funeral.</p>

<p>'Of course there's no God,' he had said, as though he were
sure of it.</p>

<p>'Well, what is there then?' Benjamin asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing at all,' Barney had answered gaily. 'We're nothing
but monkeys, old boy. You are old enough now to read Darwin.
He'll tell you.'</p>

<p>What an astonishing idea! Then all this going to church and
saying your prayers, that had been going on for hundreds of
years, meant nothing at all. There was no gigantic old man with a
white beard sitting on a cloud and listening! His mother and Aunt
Jane and the others were all taken in! A stupendous thought! But
he had only Barney's word for it, and you could never be sure
whether Barney meant what he said!</p>

<p>Oh! there was the organ-grinder coming round the corner! He
could just see him in the dim light, and there, joy of joys, from
the opposite side was the muffin-man approaching! There
<i>must</i> be a God, or why should there be muffin-men and
organ-grinders? Would the organ-grinder have a monkey? The door
opened and Lady Herries entered. She was a little, faded, old
woman now, and Benjamin was certain that she painted her cheeks.
He thought she looked ridiculous, her dress bunched up behind and
her rather scanty hair dressed in a cascade of curls at the back
of her head. She was, of course, in the deepest black and she
walked with small mincing steps.</p>

<p>'Why, Benjamin! Dear me! Why has William not lit the gas! All
alone! Emily was asking for you! Come and tell me what you have
been doing. Ellis tells me that you and he are going to have
dinner at some quiet place with Barnabas.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Benjamin. 'Won't it be fun?'</p>

<p>'I don't think this is quite the time to talk of fun, Benjamin
dear. It has all been very distressing. However, you are too
young yet to realize what death means.'</p>

<p>The front door banged. That must be Barney. They went into the
hall, and there, praise be, Barney was, looking very smart in his
evening dress and high black hat. He was growing stout, and
looked like a very amiable clown, Benjie always thought. Chalk
his face white and give him a red nose and he would be a perfect
clown!</p>

<p>They all went upstairs to the drawing room, which was as cold
as a mausoleum. They stood in a group beside the sulky peevish
fire and talked in low grave voices.</p>

<p>Emily Newmark, a heavy stout woman in tremendous black, joined
them. It is a temptation for every generation to deride any world
that was fifty years its predecessor: Judith, Veronica,
Elizabeth, Jane--these were, in their own kind and character,
women to be proud of. They were generous, humorous, courageous
and idealistic without priggishness. No period that was their
background could conceivably be a period to be mocked. But Emily
Newmark was frankly a pity, and was one, among others,
responsible for providing our satirists with a living. She
believed that Politics and the Services were the only polite
careers, and the Land and the Funds the only springs of wealth
that could be called decent. She was a snob and a toady. If a
gentleman smoked in front of a lady he was insulting that lady's
morals. She was always ready to be insulted. She looked absurd in
her gathered flounces, draped skirts, and hair-plaits at the back
of her head, but thought she was magnificent. She approved of the
Queen in retirement and was preparing to be shocked by the Prince
of Wales. (She <i>wanted</i> to be shocked.) She considered
<i>all</i> foreigners (including--very much including--Americans)
false, obscene, dangerous and unwashed. (Her own ablutions were
neither so constant nor thorough as you would suppose.)</p>

<p>She approved of archery, croquet and painting in water-colours
for young girls, but thought that that was enough excitement for
them. She was an exceeding prude with a passionate private
curiosity in sexual matters. She believed in good works, Missions
to the Heathen, and patronizing visits to the slums. She was, in
fact, <i>all</i> wrong, being hypocritical, snobbish, unkind to
servants, a worshipper of wealth and a devout believer in a god
whom she had created entirely after her own image. She was not a
typical woman of her period--only typical of the section of it
that was the easiest for after-generations to caricature.</p>

<p>She disapproved, of course, entirely of her brother Barney;
she thought his novels 'horrid' with their racing, gambling, and
loose women. Sometimes he brought men like Mortimer Collins to
the Newmark home, and they smoked and drank together in Barney's
sanctum. Now that both Phyllis and Stephen were gone, that Horace
lived in Manchester, that Mary was dead, and Katherine married,
Emily took charge of the Newmark remnants, Phyllis (named after
her mother) who was a weak character, Barney who was not, and
Stephen who was a lazy ne'er-do-well. She thought that she
dominated all three, but Phyllis agreed with her in order that
she might get what she wanted--new hats, novels from the library
and a succession of silly young men; Stephen stole money from
her, and Barney laughed at her. But Emily, in her blind
self-satisfaction, arrogant patriotism and hypocritical prudery,
learnt nothing. She had, however, her effect on others . . .</p>

<p>She had her effect on this particular and very important
evening, for had she not entered the Hill Street drawing room
just when she did she might not have exasperated Barney to his
point of later recklessness.</p>

<p>'What's this I hear, Barney?' she cried. 'You are surely
staying indoors this evening?'</p>

<p>'I am not,' said Barney.</p>

<p>'Well, of course,' and her voice was of a sepulchral gloom,
'it is not for me to say, but father has only been buried two
days--'</p>

<p>'Father won't mind,' Barney said. 'He has other things to
think of.'</p>

<p>Emily had but just sat down on the sofa. She rose.</p>

<p>'I will not hear such blasphemy. Nor shall this poor child.
Benjamin, come with me.'</p>

<p>'Benjie is my guest tonight,' Barney remarked. 'He is to share
my humble chop in some decent quiet place where we can think
reverently of the past and pray hopefully for the future.'</p>

<p>Emily was aghast. She was truly and honestly aghast. This
seemed to her a horrible thing. She broke into a flood of oratory
in which their poor father, their poor mother, their poor sister
Mary, all looked down from heaven in an agony of distress, in
which childhood and vice, innocence and nasty men of the world,
insults to herself and Lady Herries, all confusedly figured.</p>

<p>'Ellis will at least support me in this.'</p>

<p>'Ellis is coming with us,' said Barney.</p>

<p>She burst into tears.</p>

<p>'Oh, dammit, I can't stand this!' Barney cried. 'Come along,
Benjie.' And Benjie rather sheepishly followed him out.</p>

<p>Down in the hall they found Ellis.</p>

<p>Ellis, waiting, looking up to the staircase, down which they
were descending, had then the oddest hallucination. He was not an
imaginative man, but, staring in the rather dim gaslight, he saw
this: Barney had vanished. Benjamin, not a boy but a man of
mature years, had halted on the stairs. Behind him stood a very
beautiful lady in a white evening cloak with a high white collar.
There was a Chinese clock at the turn of the stairs, a tall, thin
clock brilliant in gilded lacquer. He noticed the time on its
round face. It was twelve-thirty exactly. He was conscious of a
violent, suffocating rage, and he heard his own voice, high,
shrill, convulsed: 'Get out, both of you! Get out! Get out!'</p>

<p>As quickly as it came, it was gone.</p>

<p>There was no clock. Benjie jumped the last two steps.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Ellis!' he cried.</p>

<p>This only meant that Ellis was tired and had a headache. When
one had a headache one did not know what one was seeing or what
one was hearing. These last few days had been trying, with so
many members of the family in and out of the house. But he always
felt a little queer with Benjamin, never quite at his ease. He
was not perhaps comfortable with small boys, and you could never
be sure whether they were not laughing at you. But it was more
than that. Ever since that day, ten years back, of the Heenan and
Sayers fight, he had had an almost nauseating impression of
Walter Herries. He could see him now, wandering, lost, drunk, you
might have said, a disgusting old man, and also his own
half-brother. He hated to think that he had any link with him.
And here was the man's grandson. They said that Walter's life in
Cumberland was a disgrace. That horrid man's son had murdered
this boy's father. Everything that was abnormal, fantastic,
revolting--cruelty and illicit passion and madness--were in the
strain of that branch of the family. And he was himself mixed in
it, he who loved everything to be proper and sane and wholesome
and virtuous. He had a passion for virtue! But old Walter and he
had the same father. He would have cut all that off as he would
have cut off a diseased arm, and so he would have been able to do
were it not for this boy. The boy seemed normal and decent
enough. But he was young yet. You could not tell what the future
would be. And just as something in that branch disgusted him, so
something attracted him. He had insisted that the boy should be
invited to Hill Street. He tried to be friendly with the boy, but
he was not clever at friendliness, poor Ellis. He wanted to be so
many things that nature prevented him from being.</p>

<p>'All right,' said Barney. 'Shall we go?'</p>

<p>They found a cab in Berkeley Square and, on the way, Barney
enlarged to Benjamin on the delights of London life.</p>

<p>'You shall have a night out, young 'un. We'll have dinner at
Duke's. No, be quiet, Ellis. It's my evening. What are you,
Benjie? Fifteen? Dammit, you look seventeen anyway.' He'd like to
give the boy a week. He'd take him to the Caf&eacute; Riche,
Sally Sutherland's, Kate Hamilton's, Rose Young's, Mott's.
Caf&eacute;s were open all night. Pity he hadn't been with Barney
at the fight between King and Heenan, driving across London
Bridge three in the morning with a pork pie in your pocket.
Mott's, too, where old Freer kept guard. None of your tradesmen
let in there--not that Barney minded tradesmen. 'You're in the
City, Ellis, yourself, aren't you, my boy?' But still a gentleman
was a gentleman when it came to eating together. It was at Mott's
you could have seen 'Skittles', famous for her ponies, or lovely
Nelly Fowler. And Kate Hamilton's--well, Benjie was still at
school so he'd say no more. But you should have seen a raid at
Kate's--carpets turned up, boards--under which bottles and
glasses were hidden--raised, all in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Or the 'Pie', where you were positively bound to have a row
before the night was up and where you tipped the Kangaroo so that
he shouldn't knock you down.</p>

<p>Barney wasn't a bad fellow; he was warm-hearted, generous, a
famous friend, but tonight three things drove him on--the thought
of his sister Emily, Ellis' air of wanting 'to be a sport' and
wanting, too, to go home to his comfortable bed, and Benjie's
excitement. He really loved the boy that night as he sat there, a
proper little gentleman, his high hat tilted a trifle, his lips
parted with his eagerness, his fresh colour, his sparkling eyes,
his laugh, his readiness to trust anyone, his impulse to throw
himself into whatever adventure was forward. 'I'll look after
him,' he thought. 'I'll see that he comes to no harm.'</p>

<p>Duke's, near St Alban's Place, was half-hotel, half-hostelry.
In the bedrooms the beds were cleanly enough, and most of the
residents slept in them all day because they were out and about
all night. A number of the residents may be said to have never
been sober.</p>

<p>Excellent joints could be had for dinner, and the best of eggs
and bacon any time of day or night, but the establishment
<i>did</i> exist mainly for drinking--no one pretended other.
Brandy-and-soda, rum and milk all day, sherry and bitters before
breakfast, and a glass of brandy for tea.</p>

<p>A later generation might have thought Duke's eating room a
little on the stuffy side. Everything was a trifle close, smelly,
thick with tobacco and brandy fumes, linen and under-linen not
quite clean, a strange air of rooms littered with feathers from
an old bed, warm with the odour of unwashed bodies, cats
furtively picking at fish-bones on a sanded floor, and the
Chairman banging with his hammer on the table in the
smoke-thickened distance. Stuffy! That was the word for the
night-life of the London of the 'sixties.</p>

<p>But for Benjamin, Duke's room was Paradise. He gazed with eyes
of wonder and admiration at old Charles, the presiding deity, who
shuffled about in a tiny snuff-coloured tail suit and slippers,
who--Barney told him--was never known to sleep, for at any moment
of day or night he was ready to assist a drunken gentleman from a
cab, or part two combatants. There were two chuckers-out, Jerry
and Tom--men, it seemed, of almost legendary strength. It was
nothing, Barney said, to see a long wooden coffin come down the
stairs into the middle of the diners. One of the gentlemen had
died upstairs, of delirium tremens. No one thought anything of it
at all.</p>

<p>Dinner went well enough. Ellis was quiet. He seemed even to be
enjoying himself and watched a young swell with an eyeglass and
long moustaches drink one brandy and soda after another.
'Marvellous, isn't it?' he said in his precise careful voice.
'Can't think how he does it!'</p>

<p>But it was here and now that Benjamin had the first brandy and
soda of his life. He had tried gin up in Cumberland, but had not
liked it. Cherry-brandy had been an adventure at Rugby. But this
brandy and soda was different. It may be said, in a way, to have
changed his whole life. He was ready for it. In many ways he was
old, very old; in others he was a baby. But the recklessness, the
urge to do something simply because it was forbidden, the bravado
that led him again and again to challenge anybody at anything,
the absence in him, not of a sense of good and bad, but
altogether of a sense of right and wrong, all these were pledged
by him that night in that glass of brandy and soda. As he drank
it down he may be said to have whispered to his familiar spirit
the words that were to be his Creed all his days: 'I'll do what I
want. I'll see all that I can see. I'll love and enjoy with all
my heart. I'll do no one harm but nothing shall stop my
adventure.'</p>

<p>To be fair to Barney it was true that Benjie <i>looked</i>
seventeen. There was something in his hard blue eye, in his
confident carriage and his air of assurance that made him seem,
even then, mature. But he was not; in one meaning of the word, he
would never be. After that brandy and soda he was ready for
anything and he thought that it would be amusing to tease
Ellis.</p>

<p>Ellis was twelve years older. He was staying in Ellis' house,
and Ellis had been kind to him. For all these reasons he should
have been polite to Ellis. But he was happy, he was reckless, he
liked old Ellis even though he <i>was</i> a bit of a woman and
even though Ellis didn't like him. So, on their way to the
'Paragon', he broke out:</p>

<p>'I say, Ellis--what relation are you to me really? Ought I to
call you Uncle?'</p>

<p>'No, of course not. What an idea!'</p>

<p>'But <i>what</i> are you? My grandfather is your brother,
ain't he?'</p>

<p>'My half-brother,' Ellis answered stiffly.</p>

<p>'Oh, so you're my half-great-uncle! What a funny thing to be
to anybody!'</p>

<p>'All right,' said Ellis, yet more stiffly. 'We'll forget
it!'</p>

<p>'Oh, I shan't forget it! I say, Barney, isn't that funny? To
be someone's half-great-uncle?'</p>

<p>He hadn't a notion that Ellis was minding. All life was rosy
and golden. Never, never had he been so happy before. He loved
Barney and would do anything in the world for him. The streets
were a glory of light and splendour. Wouldn't it be fine to be
going to the Opera in the Haymarket--and then, all in a moment,
they are out of Piccadilly and walking down a street where the
gas is flaring over coarse scraps of meat, where linen-drapers
are still, at this hour, invaded by poorly dressed women wanting
pennyworths of needles or farthingsworths of thread, where there
are little open dens, reeking with the odour of fried fish and
sausages, where a lady in a mob-cap is instructing a sailor in
the mysteries of the famous dance 'Dusty Bob and Black Sal',
where a huge Negro, his teeth gleaming white under the gaslight
and his brown chest bare, is turning somersaults for pennies!</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly, they were in broad lighted streets again
and passing through the wide painted doors of the 'Paragon'.</p>

<p>'We'll walk about,' said Barney. 'We can see just as well from
here.'</p>

<p>Benjie had never been to a real theatre before. It was a while
before he could take all the dazzling brilliance into his system.
First the stage with its blaze of light held him. A group of
young women in low green bodices and wide skirts were dancing
while two gentlemen in evening dress, one at each corner of the
stage, waved flags. A large box, protruding over the stage,
contained a crowd of gentlemen, very elegant and noisy, smoking
cigars and leaning over to shout encouragement to the girls. At
the back of the theatre everyone was walking about, talking and
laughing. There were little tables at which ladies and gentlemen
were drinking. Men stood up in the pit and shouted at one
another.</p>

<p>'Hullo, Connie!' Barney said. 'Never thought I'd see you
here.'</p>

<p>'Oh, didn't you? Well, where were you last Friday night? I was
waiting an hour and a half and wouldn't have had no supper at all
if a gentleman hadn't taken pity on me. Nice treatment, I call
it!'</p>

<p>Benjie thought that, save for his mother and Veronica, he had
never seen anyone so beautiful. She was fair with bright blue
eyes, ringlets and a dress the colour of primroses, gathered into
great festoons at the back. She was angry, anyone could see, but
Barney was not at all discomforted, only more like a clown than
ever, his hat on one side of his head, grinned and stared over
his shoulder to see who else might be there. Benjamin feared that
she was about to do something desperate, she looked so angry, but
her eyes fell on himself. She smiled, a lovely, entrancing
smile.</p>

<p>'Hullo, baby,' she said. 'Where's your mother?'</p>

<p>He smiled back, and murmured something with proper
bashfulness.</p>

<p>'Isn't he a pet? What's your name, dear?'</p>

<p>But Barney was, in an instant, the guardian. He put his hand
on Benjie's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Now then, Connie, enough of that.'</p>

<p>Her voice was soft. She stared at Benjie as though she could
eat him.</p>

<p>'All right,' she said quietly, 'I shan't hurt him.'</p>

<p>There were two chairs near to them. She sat down in one and
motioned Benjie to the other.</p>

<p>'There! Now we are at a proper distance. Is he your guardian
or something?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Benjie.</p>

<p>'What's your name then?'</p>

<p>'Benjamin Herries.'</p>

<p>'Well I never! Do you often come here?'</p>

<p>'It's the first time,' said Benjie.</p>

<p>'But not your last, I'll be sworn. Here! you want a flower in
your buttonhole. Take this.'</p>

<p>She had two small white roses at her waist. She took out one
and gave it him. Very proudly he stuck it in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>'You're the prettiest boy I've <i>ever</i> seen!' She drew her
chair a little closer. 'Like to come and see me one day?'</p>

<p>'I should very much,' said Benjie. 'Only you see--' He was
about to say that tomorrow he would return to school, but that
seemed to him childish, so he altered it to 'I don't live in
London.'</p>

<p>'Where do you live then?'</p>

<p>'In Cumberland.'</p>

<p>'Where's that?'</p>

<p>'Up in the North.'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind where you live. Here, see, I'll give you my
card and then--'</p>

<p>But it seemed that Ellis, who had been standing awkwardly by
himself, was now remonstrating, in great excitement, with Barney,
for Barney broke out:</p>

<p>'Come on, young Benjamin. We'll go and visit the Captain.
Ta-ta, Connie. See you again.'</p>

<p>Benjamin had to go. He had just not courage enough to demand
that he should stay, but as Ellis and Barney turned ahead of him,
the lovely Connie, coming so close to him that his nose was
suffocated in some scent that seemed to contain a whole garden of
flowers, caught his neck in her fair hand and kissed him.</p>

<p>He ran after the others, his heart hammering, his cheeks
flaming, and his mouth tasting of some sweet powder. Who had ever
dreamt that life could be like this?</p>

<p>They went behind the stage to a large room in which ladies
(performers evidently) were drinking with bearded and high-hatted
gentlemen, while a funny little man in a very light waistcoat and
bushy side-whiskers claimed Barney as his most intimate friend,
bowed gravely to Ellis, and asked them all to have a drink.</p>

<p>But Benjie saw and heard nothing. He sat in a dream of
happiness. Oh! what a lovely lady! How kind, how generous, how
amusing! It was always his first thought when he met anyone whom
he liked that he wanted to make his new friend a present. What
could he give her in return for his rose? He had the ten
shillings that Ellis had bestowed on him--or, at least, he had
some of it. He could buy her flowers or fruit. Barney would tell
him where she lived. He would go to visit her . . . Into the
middle of these charming dreams Ellis gruesomely plunged.</p>

<p>'Benjamin, we are going home, you and I.'</p>

<p>'Going home?' he gasped.</p>

<p>'Yes. You must not be up late. You are returning to Rugby
tomorrow. I myself am tired.'</p>

<p>'But of course I am not going home!'</p>

<p>He hated Ellis, who had the sad long face of a horse pining
for its stable.</p>

<p>'This is no proper place for you,' he said.</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Well--it's plain--you are only a boy--Places like this--'</p>

<p>To do Ellis justice, this was one of the most difficult things
that he had ever had to do. He did not wish to preach, to improve
others; on the contrary, his desire was that he should be a jolly
companion, a merry wit, a Prince of Good Fellows. But nature is
too strong for us. Good fellows are not made, they are born. His
capacity for finding life shocking was abnormally large. It was
not his fault that it was so. It was simply his destiny. He did
not want to spoil Benjamin's fun; he only thought it dreadful
that Benjamin should be finding this fun at all.</p>

<p>'You are to come with me,' he said, his voice trembling. He
looked out of place, absurd, in that room.</p>

<p>Benjie saw it and, unhappily, Benjie laughed.</p>

<p>'You don't know how funny you look, Ellis!'</p>

<p>Then Ellis hated him. One thing he could not forgive--mockery
that seemed to him unjust. It was his misfortune that all mockery
of which he was the victim seemed to him unjust.</p>

<p>He caught Barney's arm.</p>

<p>'Benjamin and I are going home.'</p>

<p>Most regrettably Barney was by now drunk enough to find
seriousness a farce and gloomy faces a pantomime. He roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>'I say--don't be so sad, Ellis, old buck. Why, dammit--oh lor!
look at your face--'</p>

<p>'We are going home,' Ellis, pale, tortured, terrified of a
public scene, repeated.</p>

<p>'Well, <i>I'm</i> not,' Benjamin cried. 'I'm not, am I,
Barney?'</p>

<p>'No, of course you're not. Here, Captain, this is my young
friend, <i>very</i> young friend. Never been to a Green Room
before, never seen a pretty girl.'</p>

<p>'Shame! Shame!' Ellis cried in the best transpontine manner.
He caught Benjie's arm.</p>

<p>'You are coming with me!'</p>

<p>'I'm not,' said Benjie, struggling to be free.</p>

<p>Two girls laughed. A gentleman with enormous side-whiskers,
holding a glass of champagne rather uncertainly, came
forward.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he said.</p>

<p>'Let me go!' Benjie said indignantly, wrenching himself from
Ellis' hold.</p>

<p>Ellis let him go, and in that moment hated his
half-great-nephew with all the hatred that a shy, self-conscious,
awkward man feels for anyone who makes him the centre of a scene.
Lowering his head, picking up his hat, he slipped away.</p>

<p>Benjamin was invited to sit at a table. Several ladies talked
to him. Somebody said: 'You can have four monkeys to one if you
like.'</p>

<p>'Put it down,' said someone else.</p>

<p>'By Gad,' some voice cried, 'if you can put me on to a good
thing, Gordon, I'll be eternally grateful.'</p>

<p>He drank some champagne. He felt a little sleepy. The ladies
were kind to him, but they were nothing, nothing at all because
Connie had kissed him. Then he heard the Captain, the gentleman
with the flowing whiskers and very light waistcoat, say:</p>

<p>'What about Victorine's, Barney, old boy?'</p>

<p>'I'm agreeable,' said Barney.</p>

<p>'What about the boy?'</p>

<p>'I'll look after him. We shan't be long.'</p>

<p>Benjamin found himself accompanying the Captain, who confided
to him as they went into the street:</p>

<p>'I've got a boy just your age. What are you? Seventeen?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Benjie, lying proudly. 'And a half.'</p>

<p>He felt about forty, or what he supposed that forty would
feel. Nothing excited him like something new--something he had
never done before, the company of someone whom he had never seen
before, a new place, a new trick, a new risk, a new danger. Now,
feeling like a knight of old, he strode through the streets,
trying to keep pace with his two friends so that they should not
discover how short his steps were. He did a little trot, then a
long step, then a little trot again. Where were they going? Would
Connie be there? Victorine's! That sounded exciting. They came at
length to a barren waste surrounded with railings. In the centre
of the waste was an equestrian statue. Here were oyster rooms,
public-houses, night-houses. Here was Jerry Fry's Coffee House
and there a small theatre with a large lady in black tights
painted on a crimson ground over the doorway. A four-wheeler,
lonely and disconsolate, wandered from darkness into
darkness.</p>

<p>They turned into a narrow, intensely dark street, found their
way cautiously down a kind of tunnel.</p>

<p>'Here we are,' said Barney.</p>

<p>Behind the door, through a little window, two janitors were
watching. They recognized both Barney and the Captain; the door
swung back. As they passed in, the barren waste of Leicester
Square seemed to follow them, bringing with it the 'Shades', one
of the wildest eating-houses in London, where the spoons and
forks were marked 'Stolen from the Shades' as a delicate hint to
its patrons, and the 'Tableaux Vivants', a festive hall almost
next door to Victorine's, where, for a shilling, you could listen
to more filth within half an hour than in any other place in
London.</p>

<p>'Victorine's', however, seemed as respectable as a
church-service. Barney, Benjie and the Captain seated themselves
in a corner and brandy and sodas were ordered from a
benevolent-looking old man with a hare-lip and snow-white hair.
It was not a very big room. In the far corner was a
billiard-table at which several gentlemen were playing. The
centre of the room was cleared for dancing and there was a shabby
piano decorated with two dusty ferns in pots wrapped in green
paper; at the piano a large ringleted lady in a crimson dress was
playing. Two staircases vanished into upper regions. Several
ladies were drinking at little tables with several gentlemen. But
the great glory of the place was Victorine herself, a huge woman
weighing over twenty stone, who sat at a raised desk near the
piano. It was said that she drank champagne all day and all
night. Her countenance was hideous, for her nose was flat, she
had a scar across her upper lip and a number of chins. Her little
eyes were wrapped in fat.</p>

<p>Benjie gazed at her with excited fascination. Her bodice was
cut very low and her enormous bosom shook with every movement. He
had never seen anyone so ugly and he felt that he would like to
talk to her. The gentlemen at the tables embraced the ladies, and
one stout female balanced herself precariously on a stout
gentleman's knee. Benjie was always a great observer; he missed
very little, and was capable of a detached non-moral attitude
that permitted him to see life steadily and, unless his own
emotions were aroused, with great fairness.</p>

<p>His emotions were not aroused now except that he was greatly
enjoying himself--for had not Connie kissed him and given him a
white rose? He was still, in the back of his mind, considering
what sort of a present he should give her. He had better wait,
perhaps. Christmas-time he would be in funds.</p>

<p>Then Victorine noticed them and beckoned Barney over to her.
After a while he returned and said to Benjamin:</p>

<p>'Ma wants to speak to you. She won't eat you. Come along.'</p>

<p>Benjamin went over to her, feeling rather self-conscious as he
crossed the floor, but he was ready for any adventure. He stood
on the raised platform beside her, laughing. She spoke in a deep
husky voice. She held out a large dirty hand.</p>

<p>'How are you?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Very well, thank you, ma'am,' said Benjie.</p>

<p>'How do you like my place?'</p>

<p>'I think it's very nice,' said Benjie.</p>

<p>'First time you've been here, isn't it?' she asked him,
suddenly bending towards him, and he thought that he had never
known anything so terrifying as that great round soiled,
misshapen face with its little eyes, its flat nose, its grotesque
mouth coming so close to his own.</p>

<p>'Yes, it's the first time.'</p>

<p>'You can see for yourself how quiet it is.' Her little eyes
stared into his. 'There isn't a quieter house in London. It's
these -- -- -- who come with their -- -- -- interference who make
all the trouble. Take my word for it.'</p>

<p>It was astonishing to him, the quiet friendly manner in which
she used words of a terrifying impropriety. They were not, it is
sad to say, new to him, because boys at Rugby, or anywhere else,
understand many words that would frighten Billingsgate. Not that
they had ever done Benjie any harm, these words. They were simply
counters in a normal day's play.</p>

<p>'You see,' Madame Victorine continued, her voice lower than
ever, her manner extremely confidential, 'I am a mother to all
the boys and girls who come here. You wouldn't believe all that I
do for them. Saved their lives again and again. Mother I am and
Mother they call me. I'm a widow, you know,' she added
unexpectedly. 'My late husband was a Captain in the Army and he
died in the West Indies of a yellow fever.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' Benjie said. He could think of nothing else to
say.</p>

<p>'Yes. It was a tragedy.' There was a tear in her eye. Her vast
bosom heaved. He thought that she was going to cry, but instead,
to his great surprise, she banged with her fist on the desk and
yelled in a voice of thunder, 'Here, you dirty ----. Get out of
here! Didn't I tell you last Thursday not to show your ---- face
in my place again? Here, Cormey, put him out! Knock his ---- face
in if there's an argument!'</p>

<p>Benjie turned to see a very mild-looking little man, bearded,
in a dirty sack-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers talking with a
big man in his shirtsleeves. The little man gave one glance round
the room and vanished through the door. At the same moment Barney
came and rescued Benjie, bringing him back to their table.</p>

<p>Barney was never so drunk that he did not know what he was
doing. Now he preached Benjie a little sermon. 'You see, my boy,
I've brought you here to show you life a bit. But never do
anything you'd be ashamed of your mother knowing. You're young
yet, but how are you to know what to avoid if you don't look
round a bit?'</p>

<p>'I say, Barney,' said Benjamin. 'I want to give that lady a
present. I'm going back to Rugby tomorrow so there isn't much
time. Do you think you could give her something from me? I'll pay
you back when I get my pocket-money. I've got a bit now that
Ellis gave me, and with two weeks' pocket-money--'</p>

<p>'Here you are, my boy,' said Barney, diving confusedly into
his pocket.</p>

<p>He produced two golden sovereigns.</p>

<p>'I don't know what you are talking about, but if it's money
you're wanting--'</p>

<p>Two sovereigns!</p>

<p>'Oh, I say! But, Barney, I shan't have two pounds for
months!'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind! Keep them.'</p>

<p>'No. If I give her something, you see, I want it to be with my
own money--'</p>

<p>He kept a sovereign. With luck he could pay that back by
Christmas. A sovereign! He could buy her something fine--a scarf,
a pin, a brooch . . . And it was then that the fun began. Over
the silver image of his divine Connie he saw, rising as it were
from the floor, a thick-set squat fellow, very hairy, very
unkempt, very drunk. He wandered, as though he were describing
with his feet a geometric figure, towards one of the little
tables, raised a glass of champagne stationed there in front of a
gentleman and drank from it. At the same time, grinning amiably,
he knocked off the hat of the gentleman. Then, turning, he began
to orate to the room:</p>

<p>'In the name of our Queen, of Mr Disraeli and little Lottie
Heever, down with the French! Down, I say, with the French! Are
they eating dogs in Paris? Poodle dogs? And is elephant their one
luxury? Right and right again! To hell with the French!'</p>

<p>But he proceeded no further, for the two strong men, who had
been watching the billiards, were across the room, had the man by
the legs and were trundling him towards the door. At the same
time the gentleman whose drink had been abstracted--stout,
plethoric, with a beard of the colour of jet--cried something in
a kind of frenzy and rushed towards one of the staircases.
Benjie, looking in that direction, saw that two young ladies,
most scantily dressed, were peering over the stair-rail. One of
them, seeing the bearded gentleman, vanished with a scream, the
gentleman after her.</p>

<p>Then everything happened together. The victim of the strong
men wriggled from his captors and, his trousers tumbling towards
his knees (for the strong men had burst his buttons), lurched
towards the piano; there were shouts and cries from the upper
floor which drew Madame Victorine, panting, upwards; some
gentlemen ran in from the billiard table; the lady at the piano
stayed with her back to it, cursing at the height of a shrill
soprano; a large tortoiseshell cat crept from nowhere and began
to feed eagerly upon a sandwich that had dropped; a table fell,
glasses and bottles crashing with it; and the Captain, who had
been dancing very solemnly with a stout lady in green, left her
where she was and reeled (for he was very drunk) towards
Barney.</p>

<p>'Here,' said Barney. 'We must be out of this.'</p>

<p>And then a fantastic thing occurred. At the end of the room
there was a long mirror hung with yellow and green papers.
Reflected in the centre of this mirror was the old waiter with
the white hair and the hare-lip. He seemed to Benjie to swell and
lengthen. As he grew in size, another figure, long and thin,
spread out behind him, caught him from the back, in the neck, and
began to twist his head round. The mirror grew ever more unusual,
for now it was swinging, slowly swinging on its nail, and the two
men reflected in it increased to three, to four, to five. They
all struggled together, and behind them and around them the room
swayed with them, tables and chairs, Madame's desk, the coloured
portraits of the Queen and the Prince Consort, the piano,
overturned tables, all swaying, swinging, swaying again.</p>

<p>Someone threw one of the flowerpots and it struck the mirror
in its centre: a great crack like a spider's web struck the
bodies, faces, furniture . . . Someone turned out the gas.</p>

<p>It was then, in that strange darkness, smelling of spirits,
dust and tobacco, filled with cries and shouts, that Benjie felt
a great exultation and a wild spirit of enterprise.</p>

<p>'Here! Benjie! Where are you?' he heard Barney crying.</p>

<p>But nothing could stop him. He plunged forward into the
darkness, tumbled over a recumbent body, was up again, had found
the piano, was enveloped by large female arms. Some woman held
him to her. She was crying, sobbing.</p>

<p>'Oh dear, oh dear! . . . And I had a nice supper at home
waiting . . .' And then, in a whisper over Benjie's head, 'Mr
Archer, are you there? Are you there, Mr Archer! Oh dear, and if
it hadn't been for the five shillings he promised me--'</p>

<p>'It's all right,' Benjie said, feeling real wet warm tears
dropping on his cheek and, in sympathy, patting with his hand
what was, he imagined, a huge naked arm. 'Only a moment and
they'll have the lights--'</p>

<p>But the lady murmured, sobbing as she spoke, 'Don't you move,
Charlie, my darling. You'll be killed for certain if you move a
step--'</p>

<p>She planted a wet kiss on his cheek. She began to croon in a
drunken kind of lullaby, her vast arms now tight about him, and
then surprisingly, in the middle of her crooning, in a sharp
businesslike voice as though she were giving an order at a shop:
'Where are you, Mr Archer? I'm here, Mr Archer, by the
piano.'</p>

<p>He ducked his head, slipped to his knees and had escaped.
Everything was wild now. Fighting was on all sides. He could hear
blows struck, bodies thudding to the floor. Women were screaming,
it seemed, from earth and air. Someone again embraced him. This
time it was a man--someone fat, paunchy and smelling dreadfully
of brandy. They were entangled, intermingled, dragging along the
ground together. The man said no word but breathed desperately.
He had Benjie by the slack of his breeches, and Benjie had his
fist in a handful of beard. The mirror must have fallen, for
there was a great crash of shattering glass. Benjie, laughing,
shouting he knew not what, tore at the beard, was released like a
shot from a catapult, and half flew, half fell through a door,
clutched at a wall to save himself and was caught by some hand.
He looked up and saw that it was Barney, Barney hatless, his
neckerchief torn, but Barney quite sober.</p>

<p>'Thank God!' He held Benjie as though he'd never let him go.
'Here's a piece of luck. Come on, my lad. It's the lock-up for us
if we are not speedy.'</p>

<p>A moment later they were in the deserted street, surveyed by
an orange-tinted moon and two gas-lamps. Dead silence. Dead, dead
silence. A little breeze rose from the pavement and fluttered on
their faces. Victorine's was gone. Everything in and around
Victorine's was gone. Ahead of them was the desolate waste of
Leicester Square with the equestrian statue.</p>

<p>'Walk! Walk!' said Barney. 'Can you walk all right? Have you
got your legs?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm all right,' said Benjie grandly. 'Are you all right,
Barney?'</p>

<p>'Hush!' said Barney, who now that he had found Benjie was, all
in a moment, drunk again. 'Hush! We'll wake Emily.'</p>

<p>Benjie's head ached, he thought that he had lost a tooth, his
right leg hurt a trifle. But he felt at his buttonhole.
Miraculous! The white rose was still there! How had it escaped?
Was that not of itself a triumph? He was dizzy with happiness,
adventure, maturity, first love, the wine of battle, the ether of
recklessness, the full, complete, uncensored actuality of
life.</p>

<p>'Barney, I've still got my rose!'</p>

<p>But Barney was striding on ahead. Benjie did a long step, a
trot or two, a step again.</p>

<p>With a sudden alarm he felt in his pocket. Yes, the sovereign
was there. What would he buy for her? A scarf, a chain, a pin, a
brooch? . . .</p>

<p>He did a long step, a trot or two, a step again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c407">BATTLE WITH PANGLOSS</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Elizabeth, walking through the dusky afternoon up the hill to
Fell House, was stopped by a little man like a ferret riding a
large bay mare. She knew at once who it was--Glose, the handy-man
at the Fortress, her father's handy-man--and, as always when
anyone or anything connected with Ireby confronted her, she
shivered with apprehension. Glose, who had sharp beady eyes and
was always a trifle drunk, thought, as he looked at her: 'That's
a pretty piece, although she <i>has</i> got grey hair.'</p>

<p>It was generally acknowledged up at the Fortress that Walter
Herries' daughter, even though she was nearly sixty, was the most
beautiful lady in the County. They liked to tell old Ma Pangloss
so, when they dared.</p>

<p>'She'll be back one of these days and send you packing, Mrs
Pangloss, <i>Madam</i>,' said a lively carroty-haired girl from
Braithwaite who had just received her notice, 'and then we'll
have a lady who <i>is</i> a lady'.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had a dark crimson coat with a silver-grey fur
collar turned up above her slender neck, and she wore on her grey
hair a feather toque with flame-coloured feathers. She was
protected from the chill October wind by a thin veil. The twists
and bands in which her hair was arranged at the back under the
little feathered hat held lovely lights and shadows, so Glose
thought. He was something of a poet where women were concerned,
and afterwards in the kitchen at Ireby he declared:</p>

<p>'She had on a little hat all flaming feathers, and her hair
was silver, you understand, and she has the figure of a girl of
twenty, old as she is. Very pretty with the dusk coming on and
the leaves blowing down, all the colour of her little hat.'</p>

<p>He was an Irishman, vagrant and worthless. He was in gaol for
trying to knife a man in Keswick three months later.</p>

<p>But he had a letter for Mrs Herries. He was riding up to Fell
House. He touched his cap, leaned down and gave her the
letter.</p>

<p>Her hand trembled as she read it by the pale light of the
saffron sky above the hill. It was written in a hand so shaky
that it was difficult to decipher.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR ELIZABETH--I am ill and would like to see you.--Your
affectionate father,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">WALTER HERRIES</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she said to Glose. 'I will see to it.' She walked
quickly up the hill. She was in a turmoil of emotion, but once in
the house she told no one anything. She had always been quiet,
reserved, by herself; her mother, who had learnt, through
suffering, restraint, had taught her.</p>

<p>She peeped in to say goodnight to Judith, but the old lady was
sleeping. Had she been awake Elizabeth might have said something,
for although Judith was now ninety-eight and was being preserved
as though constructed of egg-shell china, every noise, shock,
sudden news kept from her, yet, inside this elegant glass case,
she lived, Elizabeth fancied, an exceedingly alive and conscious
existence. Judith knew more about Walter than anyone else at
Uldale. It was she who had seen him last, who had known him
longest. To her, Elizabeth might have spoken. But to Dorothy, who
was now as fat as a tub and as contented as a pork pie, Elizabeth
said not a word. Otherwise there was only Jane, for Veronica had
been Mrs Forster now for two years, and Amabel had, of all mad
things, gone to be a student at the Ladies' College at Hitchin.
She had been there two years and was now at Cambridge, whither
the College had just removed under the name of Girton. Ridiculous
of Amabel, who was now between thirty and forty! She said, of all
things, that she intended to study medicine!</p>

<p>So there were, besides Dorothy, Judith and Elizabeth, only
Timothy (who showed no signs of marrying: he was fat, red-faced,
cheerful--a proper Squire) and Jane. Elizabeth might have said
something to Jane. She did not. Jane was such a dear old
spinster, already ringleted and shawled, her face sweet and
anxious and kind under her pale-gold hair, her small body
<i>intensely</i> virginal. No, she would be of little use.</p>

<p>Of course Elizabeth must go to Ireby, and this time she would
remain. From the moment that she received the note and read it in
the gathering shadow of the autumn dusk she knew that there was
only one thing that she must do. But oh! how she didn't want to!
Her quiet, reserved, cloistered life, saturated with the memory
and actual presence of John, devoted to Benjamin and Aunt Judith,
was exactly right at Uldale. She was young no longer. She was
nearing sixty. She shrank in every vein and pulse of her body
from the roughness, violence, hateful rudeness that going to
Ireby meant.</p>

<p>So she fortified herself with Adam and Margaret. On the
morning after receiving her father's letter she told Dorothy
quietly that she was going to stay at Cat Bells for a night or
two.</p>

<p>'Are you sure that they want you, Elizabeth dear?' said
Dorothy. 'Adam is just finishing his book, I believe.'</p>

<p>'I don't think that they will mind,' Elizabeth said. And they
did not.</p>

<p>On that first evening, sitting by the fire after Vanessa had
gone to bed, hearing Will softly singing as he occupied himself
with something in the kitchen close by, Adam tranquilly smoking
his pipe, they talked it all over.</p>

<p>The two women had a great regard for one another. Margaret had
broadened into a maternal and seemingly placid woman, more German
now perhaps in type than English. Her love for Adam was so strong
that she could not sit with him five minutes without snatching a
private glance at him to see that all was well. She knew that he
loved her but she knew also, as nine out of every ten wives come
to know, that she had not captured all of him; a certain wildness
in him had escaped her. He was her friend and she was his, but
she knew also that soon he would get up, knock his pipe against
the stone of the fireplace, mutter something and slip off to
Will--and that then for an hour at least those two deep voices
would rumble on beyond the wall, and that they would both be
happy together with a kind of happiness that neither of them
could find with a woman. So she was glad to have Elizabeth then.
They were two quiet, elderly women, sitting together by the fire;
they were like hundreds of thousands of other elderly women
sitting beside the fire that evening all over England--and the
lives of those women contained sufficient courage, unselfishness
and loving devotion to fill a Calendar of Saints.</p>

<p>Margaret, beneath her reserve, was frightened. There were many
things in the Herries family that she did not understand, and
what she understood least of all was that some of them were so
very different from others! That you should have Garth and Amery,
the Archdeacon of Polchester, Will and Ellis, Judith and Adam,
poor John, crazy Uhland and his father, all of the same stock and
closely related, seemed to her sober German imagination
extravagantly improbable. Yet it was so, and she had long ago
realized that the mad strain in the Herries family was not for
her. She shrank from it with all her quiet strength because it
was that element in her husband--although Adam of course was not
crazy!--that prevented him from being entirely hers, and it had
been that same element in his mother that had given her all her
young married sorrows.</p>

<p>Now she was set, with all the determination of which she was
capable, to keep the wildness from Vanessa! Vanessa as yet was as
good and obedient and loving as a child could possibly be, but
she was impulsive, fantastically generous, and--most perilous of
all!--worshipped, increasingly with every year of her growth,
Benjamin Herries. Now Margaret was Elizabeth's friend, but in her
heart she was afraid of Elizabeth's son. Young Benjamin was wild;
they said that he did wild things in London. He was eighteen
years of age, and in another term he would be leaving Rugby.
Then, Margaret supposed, he would come to live at Ireby and would
be terribly close to Cat Bells. Margaret had to confess that when
she was in the boy's company she could not but like him. He
looked you straight in the face with his clear blue eye, he was
merry, honest, open-handed, the friend of all the world. But he
was wild. Margaret was sure that he had no principles, and
although Adam sometimes laughed at principles yet he respected
them as a good man should. Margaret was no narrow condemner of
her fellow but she had acquired the prejudices of her time. She
believed in righteousness, and for her own beloved daughter she
would fight like a fish-wife if need be.</p>

<p>Vanessa would be beautiful--of that there was no question--and
she must be guarded against Benjamin, but how she was to be
guarded poor Margaret had no idea. Adam only laughed when she
spoke to him of it.</p>

<p>And now Elizabeth was going back to that horrible place at
Ireby with that drunken old wretch her father and the loose women
he had with him. She was going back into all that craziness and
wildness and bad living, and she intended to remain there. That
quiet, frail woman, with her gentle face, shy, retiring way, so
perfect and refined an English lady, thought Margaret, would live
in a world that must revolt and disgust her at every turn. And,
if she did remain, Benjamin would of course come to her there; he
was heir, Margaret supposed, to that place, and any money the old
man might have if, indeed, his dissipations had left him any. And
Benjamin at Ireby meant Benjamin very near to Vanessa. At the
thought of her child so peacefully sleeping in the upper room her
whole protective fighting maternity was at arms. She felt
inclined to cry out to Elizabeth, although she loved and admired
her:</p>

<p>'Go away! Please, please go away and let neither your son nor
yourself ever return.'</p>

<p>But they sat talking calmly; only once Margaret said:</p>

<p>'Do you think, Elizabeth dear, that it is <i>worth</i> going?
Can you do anything for him? Is his life not too settled? Can it
ever be your life?'</p>

<p>And Elizabeth answered, looking at Margaret:</p>

<p>'I know it's my duty, Margaret.'</p>

<p>Margaret shivered with some quick sense of chill and
discomfort. Her German blood gave her an unusual sensitiveness to
intangible influences. Many past events touched her moment's
consciousness, and future events, linked to these, hung like
clouds about her vision. It was as though the cheerful fire-lit
room were, at that instant, fogged with smoke.</p>

<p>Elizabeth slept little that night and in the morning she
shrank from what she was going to do as she had never shrunk from
anything in her life before. After all, she was returning to the
house where, it seemed to her excited fancy, Uhland's footstep
must have left everywhere an imprint of blood. That was not a
melodramatic exaggeration. John's death had been bloody, and,
although his murderer had been her own brother, that did not make
his ghost more stainless. In every room, at every turn, there
would be memories, agonizing thoughts, vain, wretched
recriminations. But nevertheless, she had no hesitation as to
what her duty was.</p>

<p>Two things made the journey easier for her. One was the
luxuriant splendour of the day. In October this country is often
a fantastic dream, and on this especial morning the fragment of
this world contained by the sky, the hills, the water, was a
glory. Last night there had been the first frost and the lawn
glittered in a dancing firefly extravagance under a pale autumnal
mist. She stood in the doorway of the cottage and looked out to
the Lake and Walla Crag. Near her was a mulberry tree; there were
roses, chrysanthemums, currant bushes; someone was drawing water,
and the smoke from the cottage chimney went up in a gay,
fluttering pennon of thin colour. A squirrel watched her from a
branch. She could see into the living room with the bright-blue
cups on the white cloth, rough pottery with a pattern of flowers.
All this world at her hand was clear and distinct with a hard
edge to it. Then, in the space of the lawn, of a leaping jump,
terrestial existence was cut off and mirage began.</p>

<p>The blue cold sky ranged like a sea infinitely high and remote
from change: the tops of the larch and birch and fir suddenly, if
they were high enough, struck a hard stainless light and were
edged like cut paper, but so soon as the feathering vapours of
mist rolled curtain-like across the scene colour so rich and
varied began that the sky seemed to belong to another infinitely
remote existence, unactual and a planet away.</p>

<p>The mist was neither ascending nor descending in clouds; it
was not thick enough for form, it only caught the sunlight and
transmuted it, and that sunlight, joyfully enclosed, glowed
within, an imprisoned fire.</p>

<p>It is the quality of this country that with a structure of
rock, naked fell and dark grim water, it has the power of
breaking into an opulence of light and colour. So the Lake that
could be cold as driving snow, harsh like shadowed steel, fierce
with white foam as a bird's feathers are blown angrily by storm,
now was streaked and veined with shadows of the grape that
trembled, as though a hand gently stroked its surface. This
trembling was not cold nor wind-swept, but burned with the
sun-filled mist. Above these purple shadows the hillsides were
orange clouds, orange in their brighter spaces, but like
smouldering, glowing embers where vapour enshrouded them. An
isolated field, a blazing tree, a strip of bracken against the
dark plum-coloured islands, shone out like the gilt of missals,
damascened, exotic, flaming to the eye where all else was
mystery, but the mist above the gold was as dim as the white ash
of burnt wood.</p>

<p>Because the sky was decisive with its virgin chastity of
eggshell blue, the misted land in contrast took all the colours
of purple, topaz, orange, and laid them under washes of pale
gold. And yet, with all this dimness the hills were strong,
striking deep into the Lake and, where they topped the mist,
hard-ridged against the chill sky. And on Skiddaw there was a
sudden flame-shaped crest.</p>

<p>Nothing but words of colour could describe this colour, but
its final delight for Elizabeth was that it was friendly. The
Lake, the cottage, the chrysanthemums, the sparkling lawn, wished
her well. She could feel the warm quiver in the air, could think
without extravagance that the sun laughed with pleasure as it
struck again and again through the mist to touch with the point
of its shaking lance the purple shadowy waters, the flaming
autumn trees, the sharp dark ridge of Blencathra. She drew in a
deep breath of the frosted air as she saw Walla Crag riding into
the orange vapour like the bow of a Viking ship. The breath was
as though she had leant her forehead against the pure cold of a
newly riven stone . . .</p>

<p>And the second thing was that Will Leathwaite drove her to
Ireby.</p>

<p>She could not have had a more perfect defence in perilous
country. But before she went she had a moment with Vanessa.
Vanessa came dancing on to the lawn, flinging her long arms out,
running across the frosty grass, breathing in the air that stung
the throat like peppermint. Her dark hair was in ringlets, her
white strong neck bare. 'She will have big strong breasts,'
thought Elizabeth, 'she will be very tall. I never saw a child
carry her head with such majesty, and yet she is dancing about
the lawn like a little pony.' She was going down with Will to
Grange to fetch the carriage. They had to keep it in Grange. As
she came nearer to Elizabeth the curve of her face from cheek to
chin, still the face of a child innocent, open-eyed, fearless,
gave promise of an almost startling beauty. You looked again to
see whether that curve could be as perfect in shadowed line, in
proportion and purity as you had at first supposed. And it was.
Her eyes, lit now with happiness, were direct, unequivocal, so
honest that they put you on your guard. What base part of myself
am I going to betray here? you must ask yourself.</p>

<p>But Elizabeth knew that Vanessa was no perfect paragon. Her
impulsiveness was always taking her into trouble; she had a
temper. She was irritated often by stupid people; like her father
and grandmother, she did not suffer fools gladly. Her mother was
always checking her for answering back her elders (which no child
was allowed to do), but, as Vanessa said, it was her father's
fault because he encouraged her.</p>

<p>She was compassionate and generous, but not at all
sentimental. At a time when both young men and young women
'gushed' and the world was on the whole more insincere than
usual, Vanessa laughed. She laughed, it is to be feared, at
Dorothy Bellairs, and Captain Forster who had married Veronica,
and Mrs Ponsonby and a good many more. In fact Vanessa was not
perfect at all. Margaret often shook her head over her.</p>

<p>'I am going down to Grange with Will. We'll be back in a
twinkle!'</p>

<p>'Vanessa!' said Margaret.</p>

<p>'Well, but, Mama, twinkle is quite a proper word!'</p>

<p>'And as soon as you are back, Vanessa, you sit down to the
German.'</p>

<p>'Oh, bother the German on this lovely day! I'm sorry, Mama;
isn't it a pity that I don't like the German language
better?'</p>

<p>She came to Elizabeth and said goodbye.</p>

<p>'Please, how is Benjamin?'</p>

<p>'Very well. He plays in the football team this term, and you
know Rugby is very famous for football.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I am so glad.'</p>

<p>'Now, Vanessa, Will's waiting.'</p>

<p>'When you write to him will you tell him, please, that I
asked?'</p>

<p>'Of course I will.'</p>

<p>'Now, Vanessa.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth thought it rather strange that Adam and Margaret
should allow their girl when she was only fourteen to go off
alone with Will--but then all the family at Uldale, except
Judith, thought that Adam treated Will with far too great a
familiarity. Servants were servants, and however good and
valuable Will might be (certainly he was a <i>most</i>
trustworthy man), still it was intended that a member of one
Class should not be too intimate with a member of another Class.
Emily Newmark, when she heard of it in London, tossed her head.
'Oh, well, we are none of us surprised. Adam Paris was a Chartist
for years and would have burnt us all in our beds had he had the
chance. Of course he <i>would</i> make friends with a common
working-man.'</p>

<p>However, when Elizabeth was seated beside Will in the little
carriage and they were driving towards Bassenthwaite she could
not feel that he <i>was</i> 'a common working-man'. He was simply
Will Leathwaite, and like most Cumbrian and Westmorland men, sons
of Statesmen who have owned their own land for hundreds of years
and been servants to none, he held his head high, said nought,
and feared no man. But the great thing that Will Leathwaite was
was comforting. He was a man of tremendous prejudices, prejudices
often based on nothing at all, and he disliked more people that
he liked, but if he <i>did</i> take you under his wings, then he
would see that you were protected. There was nothing he wouldn't
do for you, no danger, no strife of tongues (a thing that he
greatly disliked) that he wouldn't face. His loyalty was
absolute. He had long regarded Elizabeth Herries with a tender
protective affection because of John Herries' death. Further than
that, she was a member of the Herries clan. He did not think much
of several Herries whom he had met, but his friend and master
Adam was a Herries and that was enough for him. So Elizabeth was
under his wing. As he sat there, staring in front of him, saying
'Gee-up', cracking his whip, his brow wrinkled a little above his
very clear blue eyes, his rebellious lock of hair tumbling out
across his forehead from under his old high hat, he said very
little--but she <i>knew</i> that he was protecting her.</p>

<p>In actual fact he was wondering what he would do when they
reached Ireby. He did not want to leave the elderly, delicate
lady all alone there. There was every kind of bad story about the
Fortress, and that Mrs Pangloss was a holy terror. <i>He</i>
could deal with her--he would like to see any old fat whale of a
woman get the better of him--but a lady like Mrs John Herries, so
quiet and soft-spoken, what chance would <i>she</i> have?</p>

<p>At last when they were driving along the far end of
Bassenthwaite Lake, he said: 'See here now, Mrs Herries. I don't
like leaving you all alone, by yourself as it were, at the
Fortress. Please pardon me, Mrs Herries, if I am saying what I
shouldn't.'</p>

<p>By now, poor lady, she was dreadfully frightened, and her
hands were trembling inside her muff, but Will must not know
that.</p>

<p>'No, Will. You can say anything you like, of course. But I
shan't need anyone. Sir Walter is my father, you know.'</p>

<p>This made it very difficult for Will, who considered that to
warn a daughter against her own father was not at all man's work.
Nevertheless, something had to be done. So he thought, looking
straight in front of him between the ears of old Bartholomew the
horse.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mrs Herries,' he said at last. 'I do hope you'll forgive
me, ma'am, meaning nothing but good intentions and doing as Mr
Adam would wish me to do, seeing that you are one of the family,
ma'am.' He cleared his throat, gave a crack with his whip, set
back his broad shoulders. 'You see, Mrs Herries, your father
isn't so young as he once was, and there's a woman--Pangloss,
they call her--who's no good whatever if the half they say is
true. And a lady like you and a woman like her . . . I thought if
I was to wait half an hour or so and you wave a handkerchief or
some such article out of the window to say that she hadn't done
you no kind of harm--'</p>

<p>'She won't harm me, thank you, Will,' Elizabeth said. 'It's
very kind of you, and I've met Mrs Pangloss. I know that she
isn't a very nice woman. But I'm not afraid, you know. My father
himself has written to me to come and see him, so there is
nothing to fear.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mrs Herries, I quite understand, ma'am,' said Will.
Nevertheless, he made a private resolve that he would not drive
away until he was well assured that all was safe for the poor
dear lady.</p>

<p>When they had driven slowly up Ireby Hill and the Fortress
came at last into view, Elizabeth drew a deep breath of
astonishment. She had seen the chimneys and the two towers, of
course, every day from Uldale, but she had never, since her
rebuff six years ago, been up that hill. She could not believe
what she saw. How could someone as strong, as commanding, as
powerful as her father had been, have allowed what had once been
his pride to drop into this decay? She had seen the degradation
begin in him long before her flight, but the house itself, ugly
and forbidding as it was, had been proud, well cared for, the
gardens kept, every kind of life and bustle about the place. And
now!</p>

<p>She made Will stop the carriage round the bend of the trees so
that they could not be seen from the house. In this part the
veils of mist were thicker than above Derwentwater, and both
Uldale and Skiddaw were invisible. The sun burnt strongly enough
for the clouds of vapour to be faintly stained with rose, and
here, as on the islands of the Lake, the upper mist was grey
above the rose like the ashes of dying fires. But the top of the
hill, the trees, the house, were chill and clear, crowning the
shrouded valley; their detail was lined with sharpness against
the cold bare sky. Elizabeth could see everything, how the trees
had grown until they seemed to be throttling one another, how the
garden was overgrown with weeds, grass had sprung up between the
stones of the garden path, a shutter had swung off a hinge before
one of the lower windows, there was an empty pane in the top
window of the right-hand tower, stones had tumbled from the wall.
There was something especially deserted today in the house
outlined against so pale and bare a sky. As she looked it seemed
to her that the house moved, its walls bulging outwards then
sagging in again--an illusion of light.</p>

<p>She caught Will's arm.</p>

<p>'Is there not someone moving in the garden?'</p>

<p>'I don't see no one,' said Will.</p>

<p>'There--moving into the trees--a woman in black. No, it is my
imagination. There is no one--not a soul . . .'</p>

<p>She put up her hand to her throat; this was so pitiful, this
home of her youth where there had been so much life, now picked
bare like a bone, or, to see it the other way, strangled with
climbing triumphing vegetation.</p>

<p>'Leave the carriage here,' she said. 'I'll walk to the door.
Bring my bag.'</p>

<p>She pulled her coat more closely about her, for it was cold up
here, arranged her veil and walked quickly up the road through
the gate, up the garden path.</p>

<p>She did not dare to hesitate for a moment lest she should lose
all her courage, but it was a reassurance to hear Will's heavy
certain tread behind her. Then she rang the bell and it pealed in
the air as bells peal through empty houses. She looked
around.</p>

<p>'No one has tended this garden. Look at those poor
chrysanthemums. I feel as though someone were watching us.'</p>

<p>'Maybe it's the Pangloss woman from behind the window.'</p>

<p>She rang again and while the bell was still echoing the door
opened. To her surprise a little girl, very ragged and tattered,
wearing a woman's bonnet, was standing there. Elizabeth had
thought out her plan of campaign and, taking her bag from Will,
she walked into the hall and on into the small room beyond,
which, in the old days, had been the gun-room. She knew it very
well of course. But now it was quite different: the walls bare
save for an old hunting-scene picture; there was a screen with
boxing pictures pasted on it, and she remembered that this had
been once an ornament of one of the spare bedrooms. There were
the ashes of a fire in the grate and a stuffy stale smell of
spirits in the air. She put her bag down and stood in front of
the fireplace.</p>

<p>She saw that the child, who had large goggly eyes, was in the
doorway staring at her.</p>

<p>'What's your will?' the child asked.</p>

<p>It was plain that she had not seen for a long time so grand a
lady, for her gaze was rapt by the little dark green bonnet, the
green coat with the velvet collar that Elizabeth was wearing.</p>

<p>'Will you please tell Sir Walter Herries that his daughter,
Mrs John Herries, is here and would like to see him?'</p>

<p>The child said nothing but only gaped.</p>

<p>Elizabeth came over to her. She took her mottled red hand in
her glove.</p>

<p>'Poor little thing . . . You are shivering with cold. Listen,
my dear. Will you find Sir Walter for me and then say that his
daughter has come to see him?'</p>

<p>The child vanished; the house was still. A mouse scratched
behind the wainscot. She was glad that Will was waiting in the
road outside. The door flung open and there stood a fat blowzy
woman with a red round face, wearing a faded blue calico
dress.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, madam,' she said, speaking very quickly.
'The girl shouldn't have shown you in here. This is private.'</p>

<p>All Elizabeth's fear had vanished at the sight of this woman,
and she was so deeply filled with pity for her father that she
could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>'It is not private to me,' she answered smiling. 'I am Mrs
John Herries, Sir Walter's daughter, and I lived in this house
for several years. So you see I know it well. We have met
before.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and Sir Walter is not well enough to see anyone.'</p>

<p>'I know that my father is not well because he wrote to me,
telling me so and asking me to come and see him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, did he? Excuse me for doubting your word, but he's not
able to write to anyone.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth found the note and handed it to her. This brought
them nearer to one another.</p>

<p>Mrs Pangloss read it very slowly, word by word.</p>

<p>'Silly old fool!' Elizabeth heard her mutter. Her great bosom
heaved with indignation, but the letter had its effect.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm sorry, Mrs Herries, I'm very sorry, I'm sure.
You're his daughter, as you say, and have a right--although for
all the trouble his relations have taken all these years he might
have been dead and buried, poor old man, for all they cared. What
he <i>would</i> have done if it hadn't been for strangers taking
care of him it's pitiful to think. However, perhaps you'll call
another day, Mrs Herries, if it isn't a trouble. He isn't quite
himself today--he's past eighty, you know, Mrs Herries--and it's
the doctor's orders that he isn't to be disturbed by no one--not
his nearest and dearest.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth walked back to the fireplace.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' she said, 'but I'm afraid, Mrs Pangloss, I can't
do that. You see, I've come to stay. I have brought my bag. I
intend to remain here.'</p>

<p>Mrs Pangloss gasped. Colour slowly mounted into her cheeks and
changed them from red into a faintly streaked purple.</p>

<p>'Remain?' she brought out at last in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>'Yes. I have been far too long away. I should have come back
years ago and would have done so, had I thought that my father
wished for me. Now it is plain from this letter that he does. So
will you take me to him, please?'</p>

<p>They stared at one another. This very slender elderly lady
was, it seemed, nothing to be afraid of, for Mrs Pangloss changed
her tone.</p>

<p>'No, Mrs Herries, I'm afraid I can't. Very sorry, but there it
is. Doctor's orders, you see, <i>is</i> doctor's orders, and
those were the doctor's very words. "I trust you to see, Mrs
Pangloss, that nobody disturbs him, not on any account
<i>whatever</i>--no account <i>whatever.</i> I wouldn't like to
be answerable for consequences," he said. Those were the doctor's
very words.'</p>

<p>'When was the doctor here last?' Elizabeth asked.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm sure, Mrs Herries, I don't see that it's any
business of yours, but if you <i>want</i> to know--well,
yesterday afternoon.'</p>

<p>'What doctor did you call in?'</p>

<p>'Now really and truly, Mrs Herries, you are going too far!
Here you are, his only child, the only one left to him, poor old
gentleman, and you living for years as you might say right at his
very door and never so much as asking--'</p>

<p>Elizabeth's delicate face flushed and her eyes flashed--really
flashed so that a light, indignant, proud, struck the thick heavy
features of Mrs Pangloss. So, many, many years before, a young
Buck in Islington had also been struck!</p>

<p>'I wrote several times,' she said, 'but received no answer. I
understand now why I did not. I came once myself--perhaps you
have forgotten, Mrs Pangloss? I did not wish to remind you
because you were exceedingly rude and vulgar on that occasion. I
admit that after seeing the kind of woman into whose hands my
father had fallen I ought to have left it there, but I was
anxious not to drive myself in upon him . . . I was always hoping
for a letter--'</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' Mrs Pangloss broke in. 'I can have you up for libel
for that, Mrs Herries! I can indeed--"kind of woman"
indeed--"kind of woman!"--and I the only one all these years
who's been good to him. And <i>that</i> settles it! I'm a trifle
wearied of having all his relations coming round poking their
noses in, and it's got to stop! A year or two ago it was that old
French Madame who should have been in her grave years back if
she'd had any proper decency--and her mother nothing better than
a road-gipsy if all they say is true. And now <i>you</i> coming
worrying! Well, you've no right here, Mrs Herries--no right at
all--and I'll thank you to be off!'</p>

<p>She had worked herself into a splendid temper and, shaking
with an anger that had been plainly fortified with both gin and
brandy, she advanced several paces into the room.</p>

<p>That was the very thing that Elizabeth desired. It was not
very dignified perhaps, but dignity, on such an occasion, must be
forgotten. She walked swiftly to the door and then, once outside,
ran up the wide staircase, along a passage, up another stair, and
through the door into the room that had always been her father's
bedroom.</p>

<p>Thank God, it still was! Yes, and there was the same big
four-poster with the yellow saffron hangings that, as a tiny
child at Westaways, she had looked at with awe and terror, the
picture of a hunt with gentlemen in red coats, over the stone
mantelpiece, the two old chairs covered in green silk that she so
well recollected, a walnut ring-stand, the mahogany cheval glass,
the white sheepskin hearthrug, a mahogany washstand with marble
top and two rosewood pole-screens--all articles that seemed to be
part of her very life.</p>

<p>And he, her father, was in the four-poster. From the door she
could see only the peaked nightcap but, at the first step
forward, he roused himself.</p>

<p>'Who's that!' he called out. 'Alice, you bitch, I told you to
bring me a drink. Hours back I told you.'</p>

<p>She came up to the bed. And this was her father whom she had
last seen, on the evening before her flight, corpulent, rosy,
covered with clothes even too strikingly elegant, master--as he
thought--of his world. Now under the nightcap there was untidy
grey hair, drawn cheeks with a week's grey stubble; his open
nightshirt showed the bones of his throat as sharp and pointed as
those of a plucked bird. For him, too, it must have been a
striking vision--this very elegant lady with her grey hair, her
little green bonnet and her long green coat fitting perfectly her
tall slender body. He did not recognize her. He raised himself on
his elbow.</p>

<p>'Why, what the devil--?' he said.</p>

<p>She stood close to the bed, smiling.</p>

<p>'Father, don't you know me? You wrote to me and I've come.
Elizabeth. I should have come years ago.'</p>

<p>'Elizabeth!' he sat up, and at the same time, with trembling
hands, pushed his nightcap straight on his head and pulled his
nightshirt about his skinny neck. 'Are you Elizabeth? Dear me!
Yes, I wrote that I was ill. But I should not receive you here.
Go into another room a moment, my dear, while I dress--'</p>

<p>'No, Father; I've come to stay. You must--'</p>

<p>But she said no more, for Mrs Pangloss, bursting in, had
interrupted her.</p>

<p>'If this isn't <i>shameful</i>!' she cried. 'I can have the
Courts on you for this, madam. There he was just in his first
sleep of the morning and me keeping all the house quiet so that
it shouldn't be broken--'</p>

<p>But Walter, sitting up and grinning, said:</p>

<p>'Alice, you old washerwoman, this is my daughter. She has come
to pay me a visit.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' cried Mrs Pangloss with a ripe round oath, for she was
now too angry to care what she said (and had also, in the brief
interval between the scene downstairs and this, fortified herself
with more brandy). 'As she's come so she'll go. I'm mistress
here, and the sooner she knows it the better. Forcing herself
into a gentleman's bedroom, even if he is her own father!'</p>

<p>Elizabeth had crossed to the window which looked on the road
and, glancing down, saw the thick solid body of Will Leathwaite
stationed patiently by the gate. He looked up, saw her; she waved
her hand.</p>

<p>Turning into the room again, she said:</p>

<p>'Now, Mrs Pangloss, have this perfectly clear. It is not of
the slightest use for you to rant and swear. I am Sir Walter's
daughter, he has asked for me--here I am and here I stay--and you
leave within the hour.'</p>

<p>At the audacity of this Mrs Pangloss for a moment could not
reply at all. She gasped and stuttered. Then, in jerks, the words
came.</p>

<p>'Me! . . . within the hour! You to order me . . . You!' She
strode to the door, flung it wide and called: 'Harry! Harry!
Where are you? Come here a moment! I want you!'</p>

<p>Walter, meanwhile, found it extremely amusing. He sat there,
propped up by pillows, his eyes moving from the one to the other,
grinning with his bare gums (his teeth were in a glass by the
bed) and mumbling: '<i>That's</i> done it! <i>That's</i> a pretty
thing! Now for a tumble!'</p>

<p>A moment later there arrived a heavy slouching man in
corduroys, black rough hair over his eyes. He looked exceedingly
sheepish, as well he might. Here was his master in bed in his
nightcap, and Pangloss in one of her tantrums, and there, near
the window, a beautiful lady in green. He was further embarrassed
by the fact that the little girl (the child of himself and Mrs
Pangloss) had crept after him (for although he beat her when
drunk, she adored him as truly as she hated her mother) and,
sucking her thumb, her old woman's bonnet on the back of her
head, looked in.</p>

<p>Throughout the scene he kept muttering: 'Get away, Lucy . . .
'Tisn't no place for you . . . Go on or I'll larrup yer,' but the
child paid no heed, and he, Harry Borden, restlessly shifted from
heel to heel.</p>

<p>Mrs Pangloss turned to him. 'Now, Harry, you listen to me.
This lady has been asked to go. Master has asked her. I've asked
her. If she won't go, well--<i>you</i> shall ask her!'</p>

<p>Elizabeth went back to the window. She could see from there
all the soft sprawling shoulders of Blencathra above the tops of
the golden trees. The whole world swam in light this lovely
morning. Inside the room the sun fell in coins and saucers of
gold upon the faded ragged carpet. She felt the autumn sun, knew
that Will was in the road below, and was conscious of a
cheerfulness and high spirits that had not been here for many a
day. She thought: 'Benjamin would enjoy this.'</p>

<p>'Well, Mrs Herries, ma'am, will you have the decency to go?
You came uninvited--the sooner you go the better for all
parties.'</p>

<p>'I did not come uninvited,' Elizabeth answered quietly. 'And I
am certainly remaining.'</p>

<p>'You are not! You are not!' Mrs Pangloss found a glory of
liquor at her heart and the fury of a righteous woman monstrously
wronged in her head. 'If you won't go out you shall be put out!
I'm in charge here, and so you shall know. Harry, if this lady
won't go, you'll please <i>lead</i> her--'</p>

<p>But the ludicrous little scene was interrupted from the
bed.</p>

<p>'Alice! Do you know to whom you are speaking? And who told you
to bring Harry Borden into my bedroom? And I want my drink--I'm
sure it's well past eleven--and <i>The Times</i> newspaper of
yesterday. You'll fetch me my drink, Alice, and give a poke to
the fire before you go.'</p>

<p>But Mrs Pangloss, all control lost, strode to the bed, stood
over the old man and screamed at him. Words poured from her. She
flooded the room with her life story, her virtues as a child, her
nobility as a young woman, the criminal errors of Husband One,
the positive loathsomeness of Husband Two, her patience in
bearing great suffering, a struggle with Husband Two that had
nearly lost her an eye, her self-sacrifice in coming to the
Fortress, her devotion, generosity in guarding and caring for a
gentleman . . . But, most unexpectedly, Walter rose to the
occasion.</p>

<p>'Clear out, Alice. Clear out. I'm sick to death of you. I've
been sick of you for years. There's been nothing but mess and
filth here, and I'm too old to put up with you any longer. An old
man wants his comforts, and you've always thought of yourself,
you nasty old woman. And what are you thinking of, talking like
that in front of my daughter? I asked my daughter to come and I'm
glad she's here. So you be off this afternoon. Mrs Herries will
pay you what is due to you. Harry can drive you in the cart. And
tell the old hag downstairs to send up my drink. I'm
parched.'</p>

<p>The poor woman was amazed. She was stuffed after all only with
sawdust, and perhaps, Elizabeth, watching from the window,
thought, she had a real affection for him. The look in her face
of dismay and chagrin was not only brought there by drink and
ill-temper. She stared through her stupid tear-filled eyes. She
put out her hand as though she would appeal. 'You don't want me
any more? . . . After all I've done for you?'</p>

<p>'I'm sick to death of you, I tell you. I'm sick enough anyway,
but I'll spend my remaining days in peace. There, there! . . . I
can't bear women to cry. Mrs Herries shall pay you what's due and
Harry shall drive you in the cart . . .'</p>

<p>The catastrophe had been so sudden that she could only look
about her, turning her head now this way, now that, large fat
tears coursing down her cheeks.</p>

<p>She must care for him or she would not so abruptly surrender,
Elizabeth thought. She felt an impulse of pity.</p>

<p>But the woman turned to her, her words almost lost between
anger and tears:</p>

<p>'It's you that have done this, Mrs Herries, and I shan't
forget it either.'</p>

<p>Then, blowing her nose and wiping her eyes with a large check
handkerchief, she went to the door.</p>

<p>'Come, Harry,' she said. 'They shall suffer for this.'</p>

<p>'Don't forget the drink,' Walter called after her.</p>

<p>When she was gone Elizabeth opened for a brief moment the
window, and leaned out.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Will,' she called, waving her hand. 'There is no
need to wait. Please tell Mr Paris that I am remaining.'</p>

<p>Will nodded and started down the road to the carriage.</p>

<p>She closed the window and came to the bed. She took off her
bonnet and folded her veil.</p>

<p>'There are a number of things will need doing in this house,'
she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her rather piteously.</p>

<p>'You'll be kind to me, won't you? I'm a very old man.'</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c408">THE HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As the great day of November 28th, 1874, approached ever more
nearly it may be said without very much exaggeration that all the
Herries all over England held their breath. Would she do it?
Could she last the course? Were they once more in their history
to touch the Hundred? Or would she perhaps fail them just before
reaching the post? A little chill, a window left carelessly open,
a hot-water bottle neglected, the wrong food, a sudden shock . .
.</p>

<p>Barney Newmark, who had been staying in Cumberland recently
with Adam, declared: 'Pooh! She is as tough as an old hen! Not
that I speak disrespectfully, for a nicer, jollier old lady you
never saw. I had half an hour with her and her brain's as clear
as a bell. She's got eyes like a child's. Of course, she's
<i>old.</i> What do you expect at ninety-nine? She looks frail.
She was always a pocket-edition but, dammit, she's sporting!
<i>And</i> got a temper! But sweet-natured, you know, wants
everyone to be happy. They all worship her and I don't
wonder!'</p>

<p>In August she caught a cold and the news went right through
England. Lady Herries in Hill Street (she detested Judith) gave a
sniff and said the vain old woman had lived quite long enough,
and for once Ellis became quite heated and said she had no right
to speak so. She was an honour to all of them and it would be
splendid did she live to her Hundred. Garth and Sylvia, pigging
it in a little alley off Victoria Street, were genuinely
concerned when they heard of the cold. 'Oh, she <i>must</i> live
to a Hundred. She <i>must</i>,' Sylvia cried passionately.</p>

<p>'Perhaps she'll leave us something,' Garth said gloomily. Then
added: 'I say, old girl, I lost on that damned horse yesterday.
You'll have to pawn that ring again.'</p>

<p>Emily Newmark remarked virtuously that the Lord knoweth His
Own Time. What He Giveth He taketh away; but Barney said:</p>

<p>'By gad, Emily, you'd weary a saint.'</p>

<p>All over the country it was the same. In Wiltshire, Carey,
coming in from riding, was told by his mother and cried: 'Oh lor!
I hope she isn't beat at the post! A cold, do you say? Damn'
dangerous at ninety-nine.' Down at Bournemouth, where Jennifer's
brother Robert had founded a little family (Robert himself was
dead and his son Bradley reigned in his stead), they were greatly
concerned, and Ruth, a pretty girl of twenty-two, thought of
writing to Dorothy with a cure for colds that a Bournemouth
doctor had given her. The Ormerods in London <i>did</i> write to
Dorothy, and Horace Newmark, now extremely wealthy in Manchester,
thought of running up to see the old lady.</p>

<p>However, all was well. Judith quickly recovered.</p>

<p>'Nothing the matter with her whatever,' Dorothy wrote to
Sylvia. 'Of course it's very touching that everyone should be so
deeply concerned, but Jane and I are <i>quite</i> capable of
looking after her. And <i>what</i> do you think? Timothy is
engaged at last, to a Miss Greenacre of Taunton Hall, near
Grasmere. She seems a nice girl--quite a beauty but manners a
little haughty. Timothy says she'll make a good mother. I trust
he won't be disappointed.'</p>

<p>The truth was that the Herries were very ready for a public
demonstration of their position. A century or so back they had
been nothing at all--and now look at them! A Peerage in Wiltshire
(Carey intended to stand for Parliament at the next election);
Ellis, young though he was, one of the richest and most important
men in the City; Barney Newmark, a famous Novelist (famous
<i>enough</i> anyway); Adam Paris, a well-known writer (well
known at least to all the <i>real</i> readers of literature);
Horace Newmark, one of the richest men in the North of England;
Rodney, Archdeacon of Polchester, and his son, a most oncoming
Captain in the Navy; Lady Herries in Hill Street, a leader of
fashion; the Witherings, and the Bellairs at Uldale, among the
first County families of the North; and Judith Paris herself,
<i>really</i> famous so that all kinds of people asked after her.
Mr Disraeli had known her, Dickens and Thackeray in their day had
heard of her, the Bishop of Polchester often asked Rodney about
her, and as to the North itself--why, everyone knew her and
everyone was proud of her!</p>

<p>So they were determined to make this Birthday of hers a
Herries demonstration, just to show the world what a Herries
could do were he or she so minded! No other family in England, so
far as was known, contained so famous an old lady.</p>

<p>Many of them intended to be present at Uldale for the event.
As the day drew near, Dorothy, Timothy and Jane, who were the
managers and presenters of the Ceremony, had great difficulty in
arranging for what Timothy called the 'horse-boxes'. Where were
all the Herries to be put? Fell House itself would have to
entertain for the night--Veronica, Captain Forster, Amabel, Lady
Herries, Adam, Margaret, Ellis and Vanessa. Quite a problem! Jane
and Amabel must share, Margaret and Vanessa; Forster, Ellis and
Adam would have to take one of the big attic rooms. The
Witherings, who would drive over, could put up Garth, Sylvia and
Amery, old friends of theirs. Horace and Barney could manage in
the village. Will Herries, the naval son of Rodney, his wife and
sister Dora were found rooms in the Peter's House Farm. There
were two distant cousins--Rose Ormerod and Sophia Fanchard--who
were to stay in Bassenthwaite, and, lastly, Ruth and Richard, the
grandchildren of Robert, Jennifer's brother, were young enough
and lively enough not to care where they were. The two little
rooms over the stables would do for them. How fortunate that
Elizabeth and Benjamin were now settled at the Fortress! That
left more room for everyone.</p>

<p>When this was all settled there arose the question of the
Orders of the Day. It was decided that the procession to Judith's
room with the gifts and the little speeches should take place in
the morning: that would be less tiring for her. Then there should
be a grand dinner at two o'clock. In the afternoon everyone
should go their own sweet way, and in the evening there was to be
a Ball to which everyone of any importance in the neighbourhood
was to be invited.</p>

<p>This all settled, two great questions remained--one, the state
of the weather, and two, the state of Judith's health. Were it to
pour all day--to come down a regular 'posh' as so easily it
might--why, then we must all put up with it, smile, and say that
we liked rain rather than not. Nevertheless, it would be
provoking. All the afternoon the house would be unpleasantly
crowded, for these Southerners were not accustomed to Cumberland
rain and had not acquired the good Cumberland habit of going out
in all weathers. Tempers would be strained and it would be
annoying to overhear, as one undoubtedly would: 'Of course in the
Lakes it always rains.' . . . 'My dear, what do you suppose you
came for? Here it never <i>stops</i> raining.'</p>

<p>The other question--of Judith's health--was the most serious
of all. Of late she had had her bad days: how at her age could
you not expect it? She was often dreamy, far away, lost in some
other world. Sometimes she was cross and peevish when her
digestion worried her. Sometimes she was very deaf and could hear
nothing, although Dorothy always declared that she could hear
perfectly and affected this deafness simply to give herself a
rest. But her heart was her real trouble: any excitement was bad
for her, but how could she enjoy her Hundredth Birthday
<i>without</i> excitement?</p>

<p>And to make everything worse, she insisted upon taking the
greatest personal interest in everything. She wanted to know
exactly who was coming, <i>where</i> everyone was staying, what
everyone would do. Her brain was often of an astonishing clarity.
'My dear, don't be a fool,' she would say to Dorothy. 'Of course,
the Herries woman must have a room to herself.' Or 'Dora? That's
Rodney's girl. I remember. Her brother was at the opening of the
Exhibition. In the Navy. A prig.'</p>

<p>It was a delight to her that Adam, Margaret and Vanessa were
to sleep at Fell House. It was a long time since they had done
so. It became clear, as the day approached, that almost all her
anticipation was centred round Adam. It was <i>his</i> coming,
that <i>he</i> should be present at her Hundredth Birthday, that
gave her the keenest pleasure. Had she had the strength she would
have gone herself to see the attic where they were putting Adam
and Forster.</p>

<p>'Is the wardrobe large enough? Adam is very untidy, you know,
Jane. He throws his clothes all about. Is there a nice cheval
glass?'</p>

<p>But of course she could not move farther than to the armchair
by the fire. If she had one of her bad days she must not leave
her bed and they must make their speeches as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>But on the great morning of the Twenty-Eighth all was well. It
was neither a good day nor a bad day as to weather, but at least
it was not raining. Clouds shaped like ram's horns twisted above
the hills, whiter than other grey clouds behind them. It might be
that they held snow, for it was cold enough. The larch trees were
pale gold--like gold beaten very thin--against a background of
rolling hills, grey and thick like flannel, and from this vast
sprawling bed a point on Blencathra, palely lit, stuck up like an
old man's nose. Nevertheless it was not a bad day.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock of the morning they thronged the downstairs
and passages. The Ceremony was to be at ten. All the women were
in their loveliest dresses, and there was no question but that
Veronica outshone them all. Matrimony had improved her. She
knew--and dear Robert, her husband, knew--that she was to have a
child; as yet there was no sign of this, but the knowledge of it
(for now she loved her Robert dearly) gave her an added colour
and excitement. Her dress, too, admirably suited her, with its
corsage like a cavalryman's tunic, the draped back, the
innumerable narrow flounces. At the back of her head her dark
hair was piled in masses of curls, and she wore a little hat,
very small indeed, pushed forward over her forehead. The colour
of her dress was rose. She wore broad ribbons of rose on her hat.
So she was the queen of the party, and Robert Forster was
intensely proud of her. No one else was beautiful (Elizabeth had
not yet arrived from the Fortress). Lady Herries was painted and
affected, Sylvia's dress had too many flounces to suit her age,
Dorothy, was too stout, Amabel too masculine, Jane was just a
dear old maid, Rose Ormerod was a pretty little thing, Ruth
Cards--grand-niece of Jennifer--was by far the most charming of
the younger ones. She had a slight slender figure like a boy's,
and the skirts of her jacket, projecting over her bustle, made
her look like a boy in fancy dress. She and her brother Richard
were rather new events in the life of the Herries. No one had
seen them before. They won approval.</p>

<p>Of the men it may be said that Timothy was the most
impressive, for he was host; he was large, stout and jolly, and
he was but recently engaged to that stiff, haughty-looking girl
in a purple dress, Violet Greenacre. He was of the type that the
Herries admired, for he looked as though he would stand no
nonsense and would live for ever. Barney was in splendid form,
laughing with everyone. The Herries liked him because, although
he <i>was</i> an author, he did not, thank God, look like one!
Ellis was grave, dignified and, as usual, alone. They thought him
haughty, stuck-up, and did not know that he, in his heart, was
longing to be jolly, genial, generous as Timothy was, but didn't
in the least know how.</p>

<p>And what of Judith upstairs?</p>

<p>She did not know, she told Jane, whether she had had a good
night or no. She <i>thought</i> that she had slept well, but she
could not in fact be certain because it was hard to tell when she
was sleeping or when she wasn't.</p>

<p>She was, however, very cheerful, drank her tea and enjoyed her
egg. <i>Of course</i> she would get up! She had, it soon
appeared, thought out everything. The armchair was to be just
here, near the fire but not too near, the small table at her side
for her silver spectacle-case, her needle-case, a spare
handkerchief and a silver-topped bottle of smelling-salts. She
knew the Ceremony was to be at ten o'clock and she was glad that
it would be early, because then 'she could have a nice time after
talking to one and another'. Dressed, in her chair, she seemed,
thought Jane, very small and very beautiful. Judith had never
been beautiful, but it may be true to say that she approached
more nearly to beauty on this her Hundredth Birthday than ever
she had done before.</p>

<p>Her white lace cap had the brilliance of a jewel, the soft
folds of her black silk dress shone in the firelight, her cane
was at her hand, and on her black shoes were the diamond buckles
that she wore only on very great occasions. The white lace at her
wrists emphasized the fragility of her hands. Her only ring was
the plain gold one that Georges had given her. Around her neck
was the long thin gold chain that ended with a small gold watch
in a pocket at her waist.</p>

<p>But it was her snow-white hair (once so brilliantly flaming)
and the small face crowned by it that caught any observer's
attention. That small face was wrinkled across the forehead and
at the corners of the eyes and was pale ivory in colour--yet its
outlines were as firm as ever they had been. The mouth had not
the weak indecision of the mouths of so many old people. The lips
were firm, now parting in a smile, now ironic, now commanding and
sometimes bitter, for all old ladies are bitter sometimes. The
eyes, though, were never bitter. Their light was astonishingly
bright for so long a history, shining, penetrating, merry,
questioning and, above all, loving: never weak nor sentimental
unless she suffered unexpectedly some childish disappointment,
when she could look like a little girl not out of the
nursery.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that she was not feeling the
fullest satisfaction in this her great day. What is more, she
felt that she deserved every bit of it. Very few people lived to
be a Hundred and it needed a lot of doing! She was proud of
herself and proud of England. She had been thinking a great deal
about England during this last year, not with any weak sentiment
nor any boastful patriotism. She thought, it is true, of the
Queen because she was another woman like herself and had suffered
a bereavement just as she once had, but she did not otherwise
think of any special events or persons--neither of Mr Gladstone
nor of Mr Disraeli, nor of Oxford undergraduates breaking stones
in the road for Mr Ruskin, nor of Cardinal Manning advising the
Irish working-man to be temperate, nor of the Monday Pops, nor of
the famous new Ladies' Golf Club at Westward Ho, nor of the great
bicycling race from Bath to London. Even in the mornings now when
Jane read her the newspaper she did not listen very much and
often fell asleep.</p>

<p>The England that preoccupied her now was her own personal
England which seemed, when she looked at it, to spread all about
her, a bright, coloured, lovely country, infinitely gentle and
infinitely kind. The England of the wild life at Stone Ends, of
Uncle Tom Gauntry and Emma Furze, of the fireworks at the Lake's
edge, of that moment in the hall at Stone Ends when Georges had
proposed to her, of mornings and evenings and nights at
Watendlath with the Tarn black under the hill, the fresh smell of
the new bracken, the early-morning calling of the cows, the sight
of Georges coming up the path with the crimson bird in the cage,
Braund Fell and Armboth, Rosthwaite and Stockley Bridge. The
England of London, of the cobbles and the sedan chairs, the Ball
at poor Christabel's, Mrs Ponder and the Southey's and Jennifer,
the hour at Rosthwaite with Warren. The England (her happiest
England of all) of Watendlath and young Adam and Charlie (dying
so foolishly after of a little silly chill), of Adam above
Hawkshead laughing at Walter, running up the hill with her to see
the sun rise . . .</p>

<p>And later than that England did not seem to go. After that
many things had happened to England, she supposed, and Adam had
grown, married, and had a child; the hills, her beloved hills,
had darkened and been lit again by the sun, had taken on every
colour and been blinded by the rain--but in this later England
movement had ceased. Someone called Judith had lived there, but
the real Judith by then had slipped away. And yet the real Judith
was still here and Adam was here. He was coming this very morning
to see her have her Hundredth Birthday. She had every reason to
be happy.</p>

<p>She smiled at Jane, who was seeing that everything in the room
was right.</p>

<p>'I think England is very nice, dear,' Judith said.</p>

<p>'What, darling?' said Jane, who thought that she had not heard
aright, but that Judith had been talking about her breakfast.</p>

<p>But Judith did not bother to repeat. However, she said
something else.</p>

<p>'Will Walter be coming?' she asked.</p>

<p>Jane was startled. 'Oh no, dear. Poor Walter is much too
feeble. But Elizabeth and Benjie are coming, of course.'</p>

<p>'Walter!' thought Jane; 'what an idea!' He was now quite a
foolish, brainless old man, and although Elizabeth had done
wonders so that the Fortress was now clean and alive and
wholesome again, the thought of Walter coming into the middle of
this happy Birthday was most distressing.</p>

<p>'That's a pity,' said Judith.</p>

<p>'What, dear?' asked Jane, who was busy all over the room, as
she loved to be, dealing with trifles.</p>

<p>'I said "That's a pity,"' said Judith. 'You are growing a
little deaf, Jane dear. I've noticed it before.'</p>

<p>Jane said nothing.</p>

<p>'It's a pity, because Walter and I once had a quarrel and I
should like to tell him that it's ended.'</p>

<p>'He knows that,' said Jane. 'The last time you ever went out
you drove up to the Fortress and made it up. Don't you
remember?'</p>

<p>'Of course I remember. But today would be a nice day to end it
all up--a very nice day. Is Adam come yet?'</p>

<p>She had asked that already fifty times. Jane went to the
window.</p>

<p>'Why, yes. There he is now. Driving up.'</p>

<p>Judith smiled.</p>

<p>'Very good. I'm very glad.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Meanwhile downstairs, Adam, Margaret and Vanessa had arrived
and mingled with the family. Vanessa's beauty startled everyone.
Many of them had never seen her, and for others she had been
still a child. Now, although she was only fifteen, her slender
height, her rich colouring, her black ringleted hair behind her
little dark blue hat, her girl's dress with the white flounces,
the bustle only just pronounced enough to give her waist its
perfect shape, her modesty and quietness mingled with the
evidence, almost impossible to control, of tremendous happiness
and high spirits, created a great impression.</p>

<p>'That's a stunning girl!' said Captain Will to his sister
Dora. 'She's Madame's grand-daughter, you know. Yes, her mother's
a German. Her father married a German. That's him--that
brown-faced bearded fellow over there. Writes fairy stories,
books for boys--that sort of thing.'</p>

<p>Adam and Barney were delighted to see one another.</p>

<p>'I say!' cried Barney, 'that girl of yours is growing into a
Beauty. 'Pon my word, she is! Regular Beauty!'</p>

<p>Adam laughed, pleased and proud.</p>

<p>'She's as good as she's beautiful, my boy.'</p>

<p>'Not <i>too</i> good, I hope,' said Barney. 'Don't like 'em
too good, you know.'</p>

<p>But it was Ellis who was stricken as though by lightning.
Standing by himself, near the staircase, hating it all, wishing
it over, wishing that his mother would not make a fool of
herself, intensely proud at the same time, saying to himself:
'You couldn't find such a set of people in the whole of England,'
proud of his relations and despising them, longing to be friends
with them all, hating it if any of them came up to speak to him;
it was Ellis who, seeing Vanessa for the first time in his life,
as she waited a little shyly behind her father, just out of the
crowd, received a blow at the heart from which all his life he
was never to recover. It was not that he fell in love with her at
first sight; it was, more simply, that he had never known what
life was before, that he moved, at the instant, into a new world
of colour, light, sound. He stood there, staring. He gazed and
gazed. He did not know who she might be. He turned and found
Garth, already a little gay with morning brandy, at his side.</p>

<p>Tell me, Garth, who is that?'</p>

<p>'Who is what, my boy?' said Garth, who had already borrowed a
considerable amount of money from Ellis and intended to borrow a
lot more.</p>

<p>'Why, there--over there! That young girl with the black
hair--in the blue hat.'</p>

<p>Garth followed his directing hand.</p>

<p>'Oh, that! Why, she's Adam Paris' daughter, the old lady's
grand-daughter . . . Damn' pretty child, if you ask me.'</p>

<p>Ellis said no more. He stood back against the wall,
gazing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There then occurred the great sensation of the day. The clocks
pointed to twenty minutes to ten, and the party from the Fortress
had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>Dorothy was distressed, anxious. She moved about like a great
green whale, saying to everyone: 'Very strange! Elizabeth is so
punctual! I hope that nothing has occurred. Very strange indeed!
I hope that Walter has not died, this morning of all times!'</p>

<p>There was a stir by the door. They <i>had</i> arrived. All was
well. Dorothy hurried forward. The door opened and Elizabeth,
bringing the cold November air in a gust with her, came in.
Leaning on her arm, looking about him in an interested but rather
aimless fashion, was her father, Walter Herries.</p>

<p>Walter Herries! The news went round the company in a flash.
Walter Herries, who was, they all supposed, a doddering old idiot
whom Elizabeth had splendidly rescued from destruction and was
now nobly devoting her remaining years to succouring! Walter
Herries, once the villain of the Herries piece, now a harmless
old imbecile--actually he had come to Judith's Birthday!</p>

<p>It was a real sensation that gave way presently to a grave and
general satisfaction. This was well. This was indeed most
fitting! The Feud that had distressed for so long all the
Herries, that had had its climax in a terrible tragedy, was now,
on this splendid occasion, to be finally closed. This was
Elizabeth's doing, Elizabeth who had suffered more deeply from
that Feud than any other. Could anything be more proper? Soon
everyone was delighted. A chair was found for Walter in the
parlour and down on it he sat, looking kindly about him, smiling,
seeming quite happy, yet plainly without any idea as to where he
was.</p>

<p>'Elizabeth's smartened him up!' said Lady Herries to Amery. He
looked indeed quite elegant with his snow-white beard, a handsome
blue frock-coat and a dark blue neckerchief.</p>

<p>And that brown-faced, healthy-looking young man with the
bright blue eyes was Benjamin, Elizabeth's boy. Yes, the son of
poor John . . . A bit of a rascal . . . He had left Rugby now and
was looking after his grandfather's land, or <i>should</i> be . .
. But they said he couldn't stick to anything, was a great
anxiety to his mother. Yes, he was eighteen or nineteen, just
kicking his heels . . .</p>

<p>Benjamin himself heard none of these whispers nor would he
have cared if he <i>had</i> heard. He was enjoying himself
outrageously as he always did enjoy everything. Where was
Vanessa? His first thought was for Vanessa. What a rum lot of old
codgers these relations were! How ridiculous old Lady Herries in
her paint and powder! Garth he could see had already been at the
bottle. By Jove, was not Veronica a picture? <i>There</i> was a
woman! Beautiful figure and what a pair of eyes! What fun
bringing Grandfather into the middle of all this! It had been the
old man's own idea. In a lucid interval he had grasped that
Judith was having a grand birthday. He had hunted round and found
a brooch that had belonged to his wife, a pretty little gold
thing with three pearls and a ruby. He would give her that and he
would present it himself. He explained to Elizabeth that he and
Judith had not been the best of friends--but that was all over
now, quite finished. Much too sensible a woman to cherish a
grudge. And his excitement had been tremendous. He had got out of
bed himself at about four that morning to find a box to put the
pearls in. He sat in the parlour now, clutching the box in his
hand, patiently waiting until he should offer it. Rum old boy,
thought Benjamin, rejoicing in his own youth and strength; but he
rather liked him. He was just like a child, and Benjie played
draughts with him most evenings. Not that the old boy could play.
He just moved the counters about, but it gave him pleasure. And
there the old man sat, clutching his parcel.</p>

<p>However, Benjie had not come there to look at his grandfather.
He moved about looking for Vanessa. And then, of course, he
knocked against Ellis, the last man in the world he wanted to
see.</p>

<p>He had encountered Ellis only briefly since that rowdy night
in London four years ago. He was aware, without any question,
that that evening had made a breach between himself and Ellis.
Not that they were ever the kind to get on well together, Ellis
so solemn and proper, and himself--well, <i>not</i> so solemn and
proper! But he could not know with what profound distaste Ellis
now regarded him nor the deep shudder of disapproval with which
Ellis had seen Walter's entrance. What did they want to bring
that old man for? He had a wild fantastic notion that it had been
done in some way to insult himself. As with all egoists and men
unsure of themselves, like all men sensitive to an unpopularity
that they would give their lives to alter, most things in life
seemed to Ellis to be directed against himself. This doddering,
wandering old man was his brother! Did they not know that? Well,
then . . .</p>

<p>It would be, he suddenly thought, just like young Benjamin to
have arranged this--maliciously, simply to distress him. Ever
since that night at the 'Paragon', Ellis had thought of Benjamin
as wild, malicious, reckless--all the things that he hated!</p>

<p>'Hullo, Ellis!' said Benjamin.</p>

<p>They made a strange contrast, Ellis, long-nosed, pale-faced,
grave, in his official dark clothes; Benjie, snub-nosed,
brown-faced, in a long brown sack-coat and a dark red tie caught
with a gold ring.</p>

<p>'How do you do, Benjamin?' said Ellis, offering his hand.</p>

<p>'Have a good journey up?'</p>

<p>'So-so. Cold, you know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose. Well, we'll be moving up to the old lady
shortly. Quite a gathering of the clans, ain't it?'</p>

<p>'Quite,' said Ellis.</p>

<p>Benjie moved off. He had no intention of wasting his precious
life over Ellis!</p>

<p><i>Where</i> was Vanessa? He tumbled into Adam. Dear old Adam,
the man he liked best in the world and Vanessa's father!</p>

<p>'Why, Adam! Isn't this grand? I say, where's Vanessa?'</p>

<p>'Somewhere,' said Adam, who was rejoicing in every minute of
this great day that was to do his mother honour. 'How are you,
young Benjie?'</p>

<p>'So-so,' said Benjie, dropping his voice and grasping Adam's
arm. 'I say, this sort of thing makes a fellow restless. Ever
feel restless?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' said Adam.</p>

<p>'Well, <i>I</i> feel restless up at the Fortress. If it
weren't for mother I wouldn't stay.'</p>

<p>'Why, where would you go to?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. The sea perhaps. Or America.'</p>

<p>'Take my advice,' said Adam, 'and stay at home. There's no
place like home.'</p>

<p>'You didn't always think so?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Nor do I. When I'm your age, Adam, I'll settle, but as it
is--'</p>

<p>He went off, laughing, poking Barney in the ribs, bowing
ceremoniously to Lady Herries whom he detested, seeing little
Ruth Cards for the first time in his life and thinking. That's a
pretty girl. I wonder if she'd mind being kissed.' He did in fact
kiss someone a moment later, for he wandered through the
green-baize door at the back of the hall and there, in the
passage leading to the kitchens, was Hannah, carrying a tray.</p>

<p>'Why, Hannah!' he cried.</p>

<p>'Master Benjie!' She smiled. They all adored him.</p>

<p>'Here, give me a kiss! No, there isn't a moment to lose! Here,
I'll hold the tray!'</p>

<p>'No, Master Benjie, you're not to!'</p>

<p>But he put his arms round her, held her close to him, kissed
her full on the lips. Then, laughing, ran off.</p>

<p>But where, oh, where was Vanessa?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All the clocks struck ten. Everyone began to move upstairs.
There had been a change in the arrangements. A very handsome
volume in blue leather and gold had been provided, and in it
every member of the Herries family who could be found had signed
his or her name, agreeing that they from the bottom of their
hearts congratulated Judith on her Hundredth Birthday and wished
her health and prosperity.</p>

<p>It had been Barney's idea, a very pretty one. It had been
intended that Adam should present this, but after Walter's
unexpected arrival it had been thought that it would be excellent
if Walter, the senior of them all, should make the Presentation.
At first there had been some difficulty. He wanted to give his
<i>own</i> present. He had come all that way to give his
<i>own</i> present . . .</p>

<p>'But so you shall, dear,' Elizabeth whispered. 'You shall give
them both. Only this is from all of us and the other is your
special one . . .'</p>

<p>But he wanted to give his <i>own</i> present! However, at last
he had consented to hold the blue leather book in one hand and
his own precious little box in the other. Elizabeth guiding him,
they headed the Procession up the stairs.</p>

<p>And up the stairs they all crowded, laughing, joking, excited,
feeling that this was really a <i>great</i> Herries occasion,
that, as it were, the eyes of all England were upon them.</p>

<p>On the way up Barney said one thing to Amery in a chuckling
whisper:</p>

<p>'Very fitting, you know, old Walter making the Presentation.
Closes the Feud. He and Judith were enemies for years. That's the
end of <i>that</i>!'</p>

<p>At the same moment Benjie caught sight of Vanessa just ahead
of him. He brushed forward, almost, in his haste, knocking
someone over. He did not know (nor would he have cared if he
<i>had</i> known) that that someone was Ellis.</p>

<p>'I say! Vanessa! Vanessa! Where <i>have</i> you been?'</p>

<p>She turned. She was a stair or two higher. Her face was lit
with delight as she turned her head and saw him.</p>

<p>'Oh, Benjie! I've been looking for you everywhere!'</p>

<p>Ellis stared at her. The staircase seemed to rock beneath
him.</p>

<p>'Hush!' Timothy said. 'We go in now, three at a time. Sir
Walter, you're first. Thank you. Elizabeth, if you wouldn't
mind!'</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Judith sat looking at the door, Jane standing beside the
chair. She was quite calm, very dignified, extremely proud and
happy.</p>

<p>The door opened and Walter entered, led forward by
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Jane gasped.</p>

<p>'Oh, Aunt Judith--it's Walter Herries!'</p>

<p>But to Judith it seemed perfectly natural.</p>

<p>'There, Jane, I said he would come. How extremely attentive of
him!'</p>

<p>Walter had no idea of anything save that it was Judith's
birthday and he was giving her a present. But he realized, as he
wandered, gazing about him, across the floor, that that was
Judith sitting in the chair. He knew Judith well enough. He had
known her all his life. But why was he in a bedroom? He stopped,
midway, and looked at the bed.</p>

<p>'Walter,' said Judith, smiling. 'How are you?'</p>

<p>That brought him to himself. This was, in any case, Judith,
and this was her birthday. He found himself by the chair.
Elizabeth was beside him.</p>

<p>'Well, Judith,' he said, his eyes still roving about the room.
'They tell me it's your birthday, so I've come and I've brought
you a present.'</p>

<p>He pushed the little parcel into her lap and dropped the blue
book. Elizabeth picked it up and put it into his hand again.</p>

<p>'Father, dear. You know what you are to say. You are to give
Aunt Judith this. It's from all of us, and you are to say that
all our names are here and that we all wish her a lovely birthday
and many more birthdays.'</p>

<p>'A lovely birthday and many more birthdays,' said Walter,
dropping the volume into her lap. Then, quite of his own accord,
he bent forward and kissed her. Elizabeth had to steady him
because his knees were very shaky.</p>

<p>Judith was delighted and greatly touched. She took her
handkerchief from the table and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>'Thank you indeed, Walter. Thank you, thank you. I am very
glad you have come, because once we were not friends, were we?
And now we are. I want to be friends with everyone today. And
most especially with you, Walter.'</p>

<p>Walter began eagerly: 'And you must open <i>my</i> present,
Judith.'</p>

<p>With very firm fingers Judith undid the parcel.</p>

<p>'Oh, isn't that pretty? <i>Isn't</i> that pretty? Do you see
it, Jane? A lovely brooch! Walter, how <i>very</i> good of
you--'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, immensely satisfied. 'It's a very pretty
thing. I've had it a long time . . .' His eyes began to wander.
'Uhland would have come today, only--only--I don't know
why--but--'</p>

<p>Elizabeth gently took his arm.</p>

<p>'Now, Father, you must make way for the others.' She led him
to the window.</p>

<p>And Judith, now with her eyes bright and eager, was staring at
the door. The great moment of her life had come. Adam would be
next. Surely, surely Adam <i>must</i> be next!</p>

<p>She saw that they had all crowded to the door, and, all their
faces smiling, were staring in.</p>

<p>A figure detached itself from the crowd. Grinning all over his
face, moving his heavy body in his own rambling, comfortable way,
Adam came forward.</p>

<p>At the sight of her son Judith's eyes and mouth broke into the
loveliest smile that any member of the Herries family, here
present, had ever seen.</p>

<p><i>Now</i> her Hundredth Birthday was indeed a Triumph!</p>
