<p align="CENTER">A. RICHARDS</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>My dear Richards,</i></p>

<p><i>There is no need to remind you--far in terrestrial space
though the Columbia Valley may be from Magdalene College--of
September, 1933. "A magic gets hold of some days and they remain
with you forever . . ." So I read--a reference to certain days in
that September--in one of those welcome letters that Dorothy and
you collaborate upon.</i></p>

<p><i>The sage-brush, as you will remember, was in full yellow
bloom on the slopes of the foothills and the peaks you were going
to climb were austere in distance. The saddle-horses and the
pack-horses that were to carry you to your base camp had gone out
on their way to the road's end, and in Wilmer, all sunlight and
the ricochetting of a clicking grasshopper or two, you waited for
the car in which you were to follow them. There, after talk of
this and that, you asked me: "And what are you doing just now?"
So I outlined to you</i> The Flying Years <i>of which not a word
was written then. I will not excessively say that you upheld me
from falling and strengthened my feeble knees. I was not so
hopeless as all that either of being able to tell something of
them or of finding ears, somewhere, to hear; but I did have, at
the back of my mind, a melancholy whisper of "Who cares?" Your
interest, your enthusiasm, silenced it. The day came of "All
set." There was the car spinning away, and you called through its
dust that was enveloping me, for a parting word: "Don't let the
years fly too long."</i></p>

<p><i>I can't tell you how I appreciated that nor how memory of
it has heartened me in the writing of this book that I am
dedicating to you--in the hope that you will find it not too
grievously lacking in what, as I outlined it to you, you felt it
should contain and convey.</i></p>

<p><i>Yours,</i></p>

<p><i>Frederick Niven.</i></p>

<h1><a name="c01">CHAPTER ONE</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>Eviction</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Memory, as the years slipped past, always served Angus Munro
with Loch Brendan through a web of yammering gulls, but his
mother remembered it through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>There had come to her no omen that the Munros were to leave
there. An omen would have hinted the Hand of God in it, however
strangely, whereas there seemed to be only the callousness and
rapacity of man. Not that any supernatural warning was needed in
face of the bitter evidences, but her folk were prone to omens.
Her grandmother, as she often told, when recounting the stories
of the land, had been waked one night in the '45 by her brother
who was, as they said, <i>out.</i> She had sat up in bed, staring
at him in the dusk of the kitchen. The smouldering seed of the
fire had blazed to a sudden puff of air--and he it was, without
doubt, in that flicker of light. He shook his head to her,
forlorn-like, as in a sign that something had miscarried, and
then was gone. "So you see," Angus's mother would say, "my granny
was fully prepared when the news came that her brother was dead
on Culloden Field."</p>

<p>As for herself, when the news came that Angus's brother,
Robin, had been drowned in the Sound, she was prepared. She took
it as his father did not. Daniel Munro seemed to lose his reason
for awhile, marching to and fro like a soldier on sentry-go, back
and forth. At each sudden advance he appeared to be going for
help; then he would halt, aware that there was no help, stand
dazed a moment, wheel, and stride off again--back and forth. But
Mrs. Munro spoke slowly:</p>

<p>"That was the death candles burning over the Sound last
night," said she. "I should never have let him go this day. I was
warned."</p>

<p>She was intimate with ghosts. <i>Shadows,</i> by the way, was
the word for them among another folk in another land to which
they were all going--the father grimly, the mother in tears, the
lad with a sense of adventuring.</p>

<p>They were no great readers in Brendan in those days, though in
the winter great story-tellers, while sleet scoured the window
and night gave a hollow moan in the chimney, with narratives of
the old days, myth and truth: of King Hakon; of the Norse woman
with the flame-coloured hair; of Cromwell's soldiers that bided
in Inverness after the wars and, surrounded there by the Gaelic
speech, kept pure amongst themselves their own tongue and passed
on to their bairns the fine language of their time, so that, in
after years, Sassenach philologists would comment on how
beautiful was the English the folk of Inverness spoke; of Prince
Charles Stuart; of Cluny in his "cage" on Ben Alder when it was
supposed by most that he was long since in France; of the smoking
out of the Macdonalds in the cave of Sciur; of the pixies and the
kelpies.</p>

<p>Angus's father saw the change coming and was for the boy
<i>conning his book.</i> The English they had was thus
book-English, their natural speech being the Gaelic. Even Mrs.
Munro learnt to speak it--and with the prettiest lilt. But the
point here is that between his mother's old stories and the books
that his father got for him, and a bent he had for knowing what
was happening on the hills and the lochs and the sea--a sort of
living with the weather--the boy (sixteen then) had his own kind
of private excitement and happiness in life. He had his own
gossip, too. He would sooner hear of a whiskered seal flapping
onto the Black Rocks with gruff bark like an old man's cough,
than any yatter of human follies and failings.</p>

<p>The eviction at Brendan was quieter than some. The Munros
expected it. Daniel possessed a booklet--<i>Information for
Emigrants to British North America.</i> PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY
(that on the title-page gave them deep confidence in it),
<i>Price Sixpence</i>--and he and Angus assuredly conned it,
reading all its information on New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward's Island, on Eastern (Lower) Canada, on Western (Upper)
Canada, and were a little troubled that the Western Canada it
touched upon was not the west to which they were going. They were
going even beyond "Western (Upper) Canada." They made themselves
acquainted, hopefully, with the value out there of the sovereign
and the guinea, and discovered what an American Eagle was worth,
a Spanish minted doubloon, a Spanish milled dollar, and what was
a pistareen. A great mixture of coins there seemed to be in the
Canadas, from the French five-franc piece to the Mexican dollar.
They learnt that there were Emigrant Sheds at the landing-place
for those who could not "incur the expense of lodging," in which
they could sleep a night if necessary, and they made computation
of how much food they should cook in preparation for their
further journey into that west beyond the tabulated west of the
booklet. It was cheering to note that the further one went the
higher were the wages paid for labour.</p>

<p>Folk ate well in the Canadas by all accounts, never there, as
in Scotland, on the edge of starvation. A man could kill his deer
without by your leave of any, and there were crops other than of
poor oats and potatoes. There was even a sugar tree! Now, there
was a land for you! Think on it! Yes, there was a lot of talk of
"the Canadas" before they were, indeed, started on their way
thither.</p>

<p>Their neighbours, the Grants (Jessie Grant was the lass of
Angus's calf-love), were also leaving Brendan, but not for the
Canadas. There were but Jessie and her mother, the father having
been drowned in the boat accident that took Robin Munro. They
were going to Glasgow to live with Mrs. Grant's sister, married
to an ex-soldier, Cameron by name, a big-hearted man who had set
up as a smith, was doing fine there, and had offered, himself, to
look after them.</p>

<p>The events of the Highlands and the isles of that period put a
kind of dolour into even the young, ageing them somewhat, gave
them too soon, a sense of distrust in Life. Happiness and trouble
were blent in their eyes and the elders seemed always to be
admonishing them in this fashion: "There's no one can go courting
these days." "There's no lad can plight troth with a lass these
days."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there they were--Jessie and Angus--in the
silver-green shade of a birch wood by Loch Brendan, betwixt
Brendan and the point, on the morning of the day of departure. To
each the proximity of the other was a rare, blessed, mysterious
and secret anodyne for the public woe that they could not
escape.</p>

<p>"If I make a way in the Canadas--" Angus began.</p>

<p>Jessie interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of myself but I'm not sure of you," she said.</p>

<p>What, exactly, did she mean? What was it in him, he wondered,
that she was not sure of?</p>

<p>"Would you wait for me?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"I'll not say yes," she answered, "because--" she left the
rest in air.</p>

<p>"Because of what. Jessie?" He repeated her name, urgently:
"Jessie, Jessie . . ."</p>

<p>She sighed his name for the only reply, held her face up to
him. As he bent kissing her she turned it away in some young
distress, then suddenly drew him close, responding to his
caresses. Next moment she abruptly disengaged herself, shook her
head, her cheeks pallid.</p>

<p>"No promises!" she implored. "I'm sure of myself but I'm not
sure of you. There's mother calling."</p>

<p>She pressed a hand against his breast and ran from him as
though she were running also, in agitation, in deep distress,
from herself. At the bend of the road she halted and looked
round. There they stood looking one to the other--for an
eternity, it seemed: then she turned and was gone from sight and
he walked home by the loch-side, the incoming Atlantic tide
toying with the seaweed fringe of Scotland along the rocks.</p>

<p>By the door stood a group of men, talking. It was the old talk
(repetitive as that of the young lovers on their uncertainties),
talk upon the plight of the people in that grandly beautiful land
that the Munros were leaving.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so. Join the army! Join the army!" one was
saying to Daniel. "That's all for some of them."</p>

<p>"It's a poor consolation for a lad," he replied, "sticking his
bayonet into the belly of a Rooshian, to imagine that he is
fighting for his own and stabbing into his real enemies, the men
who have put him and his out of house and home. The army! It
might be ordered against the French next, instead of to help the
Turks against the Rooshians, for all we know as it was when I was
a lad. And the French were good friends to the Scots in the
'45."</p>

<p>The old talk, the old talk. Another spoke.</p>

<p>"They say it's not to make room for the deer that we must go,"
he said. "They say that never was any thrust out to make room for
deer for them to shoot. Quibbles! Quibbles! To make room for
sheep it is--and then the sheep make room for the deer. They'll
bring up that lie if ever we get the Commission of Inquiry that
some talk of."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's been going on since the '45," declared Munro.
"It was different, though, when it was the Sassenach that came
with fire and sword. When a man's foes shall be they of his own
household it is bitter!"</p>

<p>Angus sidled past them into the house. Just then, from one of
the further cottages up near the bracken and the heather (that
soon would encroach everywhere there), came the preliminary
sounds, the intermittent drones, of a bagpipe. Who could be
thinking of piping over the tying of the last symbolic knots on
the ropes round tin trunks and boxes? There was Mrs. Munro
plucking and plucking at her under-lip, looking out of the
window, perhaps at Ben Chatton or perhaps at a lone magpie
veering by with some significance for her superstitious mind.</p>

<p>"They tell me there are places where they do not dare to do
it," Angus heard his father say, "even with the rent far in
arrears. And why? Because clear it is that there would be blood
shed if they tried. They tell me that at some places they have
answered the threat of eviction by driving the deer into the sea.
Ah, well, by the grace of God some have bowels of compassion.
There is a Macleod, now, when the potatoes failed, who fed his
people himself to tide them over instead of turning them out.
There would be no faith in any landlord left if it wasn't for one
or two like him. But they are not in the majority. 'It's my land
to do with as I please.' That's the usual. It's bitter! First of
all driven off the good lands onto poor, and then we have it
flung at us, 'Would you not be better to go to a new country
instead of trying to live on land like that--and be grateful if
you have your passage money given you?' Well!" He came indoors.
"Give me a hand, Angus, with this trunk."</p>

<p>They carried it out. When they went in again, Mrs. Munro had
ended her reverie at the window and was drying her eyes.</p>

<p>"I remember a story my mother told me of a Highlander in
Quebec," she said, speaking as out of a dwam.</p>

<p>Her husband stared at her in amazement, thinking she was about
to launch a tale of some omen, but it was not so.</p>

<p>"It was in the days when the colonists in America rebelled
against the arrogance of King George the Third," said she, "'75
or thereby. A Cameron he was. He had not joined the Royal
Highland Emigrants' Regiment there but when the rebelling
colonists came to assault Quebec he did do his part in the
repulsing of the attack, whatever. So he was offered pay after
the fight for his services. Says he, this Cameron lad who had
gone to the Canadas after the '45, says he, 'I will help to
defend the country from the invaders but I will not take service
under the House of Hanover.' That was the spirit! Now, what was I
telling you this for?" she asked herself. "Oh, yes, I know--the
spirit in that. Yes, we are going, but we'll go proud."</p>

<p>She raised her head and with a glare dared the tears to come
again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the clergy are right," she exclaimed suddenly, over
another thought.</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Daniel.</p>

<p>"When they tell us it is the will of God that we go as a
punishment for sins, and that any who offer resistance are in
danger of hell-fire forever."</p>

<p>"The clergy," said Daniel, "have their livings from the
landlords. They know who butters their bread."</p>

<p>"That sounds like profanity!" she cried out.</p>

<p>"I'm not talking of the Almighty," said he. "I am talking of
the clergy--an entirely different consideration. They call me a
heretic, and if trying to educate yourself and your issue is
heresy, then heretic I am. But I'm not talking profanity."</p>

<p>She looked at him, troubled. His thoughts were sometimes
beyond her.</p>

<p>The blast of a siren sounded and Angus peered out of the
doorway. There was the boat on which they were to embark,
splitting the dark water as a plough's coulter the dark spring
loam. The high corries answered with their echoes to her bellow,
the gulls rose and volleyed in air, their silver reflections
flickering among the loch's reflection of the hills.</p>

<p>Silently they looked their last on the shell of the home.
Afternoon having come, an interior dusk was already in corners.
It was as if they were ghosts visiting the place where once they
had been part of the active life of earth.</p>

<p>"Scotland," said Munro, and again, "Scotland. Just a few sad
songs and old ballads! That's all. I see it getting worse every
year. God knows what the end will be. And yet--and yet--we'll
take Scotland with us: a kingdom of the mind."</p>

<p>He stooped at the rear window. His wife stepped over and stood
beside him, and he put an arm round her. By the way they bowed
Angus realized that they were looking toward the graveyard where
Robin lay, he who was drowned the day after Mrs. Munro saw what
she called the <i>death candles</i> out at sea. Though he was but
sixteen, Angus had some sense in him and hurried out, left them,
so that when they turned they would not find him there indecently
staring like a gowk of no understanding.</p>

<p>The surge of waves broke out on the rocks, an orderly smashing
pulse of water from the steamer's wake. She was out there, come
to rest, waiting for them. It was then that Daniel Munro lost his
control after that grand thought of how they would take Scotland
with them, a kingdom of the mind.</p>

<p>"To hell with Scotland!" he broke out.</p>

<p>There was a silence then like the silence left when the wind
passes through a wood of pines. It was as if Nature held breath,
as if the spinning of the world ceased a moment--a moment that
belonged to horror as over a sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"You should not have said that," Mrs. Munro whimpered.</p>

<p>"No, I should not have said that," he whispered. "I didn't
mean it, I didn't mean it."</p>

<p>And as for Peter came the crowing of the cock, there rose the
sound of the bagpipes through Brendan, in the slow measure of a
coronach.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c02">CHAPTER TWO</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>Red River</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The odours of the new land, before they had sighted it, came
out to meet them through a white mist over the sea, odours of
robustiously scented forests. The steamer crawled on, calling and
calling with her siren till the vapour was dazzlingly infiltrated
with sunlight and then, by the sunlight, dissipated away--and
there were rocky promontories glittering a welcome.</p>

<p>Further than Lower Canada, further than Upper Canada they were
going because of friends in the country beyond, <i>freends,</i>
indeed--which is to say, in the Scots sense, <i>relatives.</i>
Had it not been for these the Munros would have been much in the
condition of some of their fellow voyagers who had merely had
their passage paid for them. Landing with scarcely a penny and
bound chiefly for the neighbourhood of Toronto (that used to be
called York when Angus's mother was a girl), most of them with no
word of English, nothing but the Gaelic, they were in anxious
plight. By the charity of their compatriots in the land, given in
such a way that the name for it was changed to
<i>hospitality</i>, these went on to their journey's end.</p>

<p>The Munros' <i>freends</i> in the Red River Settlement--the
Frasers--had sent them some financial assistance. In return for
that Daniel, before taking up his own land, was to help Ian
Fraser on his; and Angus, no doubt, would be working out the
while for wages--or such was the suggested plan.</p>

<p>Of the Red River Settlement Mrs. Munro had some woeful
stories. She would narrate how the first Highlanders that went
there had been hardly used, ordered back by the Northwest Fur
Company's representatives, and might have been all homeless again
had it not been for a Macleod--a smith--who made shot out of some
chains, loaded it into an old cannon he found there, and defied
those who would turn them back, with a handful of men at his
side. Her husband had to remind her that that was a while back,
in her grandmother's day, and that the Settlement had vastly
changed since then--that here was 1856 and not 1815.</p>

<p>They went by train (not by such wilderness waterways as those
people of two generations back had gone, from Hudson's Bay to
Lake Winnipeg), by train to Minnesota, sleeping on the train,
eating on the train, a basket of provisions with them for the
journey. A young man walked through the coaches now and then with
boxes of a crisp sort of biscuit new to them called
<i>crackers</i>, and with fruit. Mrs. Munro, after one sampling
of his peaches, would resolutely turn her eyes away on hearing
him chant his seductive wares. So juicy were these peaches that
she had to spread her handkerchief--her pocket-napkin--on her
knees when eating them. Never had she known such
lusciousness.</p>

<p>"Pea-ches! Or-an-ges!" came the young man's cry, and her head
would turn and she would stare hard out of the window.</p>

<p>"We have our basket of sufficient food," said she, "and if I
succumb to the temptation of these fruits, and this craving for
them, we will have to spend all ere we come to journey's end,
whatever!"</p>

<p>Leaving the train at St. Cloud they went on by stagecoach, a
four-horse coach, clip-clopping along in a rhythm that at times
made the lids droop, sleepy, over eyes that would fain see all
the way, clip-clopping and swaying through forests the heady
odour of which excited young Angus, and across clearings where
stumps smouldered, and by the side of lonely rushy lakes like
dropped fragments of blue sky. <i>Minnesota</i>, the driver told
Mrs. Munro, was a Sioux Indian word meaning "sky-reflecting
water." Each night they stopped at some rest-house by the
wayside. Some of the men at these places Mrs. Munro thought the
most fearsome she had ever seen, grim of visage and with
revolvers at their belts in big holsters. But if ever she and one
of them came face to face in a doorway it was always, "Pardon me,
ma'am," and hats off. And "Ma'am" it was at the tables when they
passed her the cruets. They did not wear their armaments when
eating, always, she noticed, before they came into the
dining-room, as casually as they hung up their hats, handing to
the proprietors of the places their ammunition belts with the
pistols attached, as in some usage or courtesy of the
country.</p>

<p>As she whispered to him her comments on the ways of this
region, Daniel thought she was beginning to be eased of the sense
of being far from home which clearly had shadowed her hitherto.
But when they came to Abercrombie on the Red River and she
discovered that there they had still further to go, aboard a
boat, she came near to breaking down. Every roll of the train
wheels, the drumming of the stage coach horses' hoofs, the
thrashing of the big stern-wheel on the river boat, told her the
same refrain--<i>A far cry to Loch Brendan.</i></p>

<p>As for the Settlement: each of them on arrival promptly
observed it in a different way, and in that difference you have
all three measured and weighed. Mrs. Munro saw the houses as
alien, they being built of logs. Munro saw them as not altogether
strange, they being thatched; and Angus saw them as romantic,
they being of log with thatch. The lack of a mountain-side on
which to rest their eyes was dreadful to Mrs. Munro, to Mr. Munro
odd, to Angus novel and exciting.</p>

<p>Their <i>freends,</i> the Frasers, welcomed them warmly. Ian
Fraser, the father, was working out at the time with a
wheelwright for wages, toward getting money instead of getting
exchanges of goods for his produce. On the steamship
<i>International</i>, which had brought them there, he found a
job for Angus as deck-hand. Daniel, according to their agreement,
began to work on the farm.</p>

<p>A happy family--Fraser and his wife, Hector, the son, about
eleven then, Fiona, between five and six, and little Flora, age
four, named after her mother. There was no impression of a cloud
over life there as at Loch Brendan, but a sense of freedom to the
point of wildness. With the family increasing they had added to
the original house, and with a little contrivance there was room
for the Munros.</p>

<p>Several times during the days that followed his arrival there,
young Angus remembered how his father had spoken of a kingdom of
the mind--Scotland, a kingdom of the mind. Surely it was so here,
with the Gaelic round them, the burr of the Scots voices, and
often the pipes playing about the place from one house to
another. Yet looking back on those days later, there was no doubt
in his mind at all that as he recalled and was aided by that
phrase--<i>a kingdom of the mind</i>--his mother was haunted and
vexed by her husband's cry of <i>To hell with Scotland!</i> Not a
word of that had they from her, but she had not forgotten it, and
being of a superstitious turn it gnawed in her, first like a
recurrent and then as she did not rout it, like a chronic
sickness. Indeed, she was not, as they used the word there, a
<i>well</i> woman. It was all, for her, despite the Gaelic and
the pipes, far from home.</p>

<p>For Angus one of the great pleasures in the change from Loch
Brendan was in the food. One never had to say here, "If that's my
dinner I've had it!" They were not limited to potatoes and them,
perhaps, none too good because of a wet season. Fine trout could
be fished, and all round about they could shoot the prairie
chickens, while venison was everybody's. Hunters came in from the
Great Plains with buffalo meat, and Mrs. Fraser taught Mrs. Munro
both how to prepare it and to preserve it (as the French and
Scots half-breed hunters had learnt from the Indians, beating in
with it various berries) so that it would keep for months--for
years, if need be, they said. When Ian was reading the Scriptures
aloud one night and came to the words <i>Shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more,</i> they meant to Angus the new land. He
was not going to be one of those who make a god of the wame, but
it was good to rise from the table satisfied.</p>

<p>In some ways the people were wilder than at home, in others
more kind. A man was much more his brother's keeper, if ever
there was occasion for brotherly help. None asked servility but
most practised courtesy. On Sunday there were church
services--all in their braw clothes. You would see silks then,
silk gowns, and below them the feet that peeped in and out were
in moccasins as often as not, moccasins heavily beaded, that
could be got in trade with the Indians for a twist of tobacco.
Some folks in the Scots settlement had the blinds down all
Sunday, but neither the Frasers nor the Munros believed in
that.</p>

<p>"Keep the good light of God out on the Sabbath day? Na, na,"
said Mrs. Fraser.</p>

<p>There was not much money in the place, though wages were
higher than in the east. Almost all was done in
<i>Trade--</i>which is to say exchange or barter. It was towards
getting money against the time when they would be taking up their
own land, and building on it and living apart from the Frasers,
that Angus had gone to work on the river boat--the
<i>International.</i> A month or two later he was offered, and
accepted, other work--on what they called the <i>flat
boats</i>--with a Captain Buchanan, from Ayrshire. It was not but
an honorary or whimsical title. He had been a blue-water sailor
and captained ships round the Horn and there he was, far inland,
caught by some call of this great continent's interior. In
Minnesota there was wood and with the Red River settlers there
was a scarcity of it, so there was a brisk trade in bringing
timber from south of the line. The method of transport was to
lash it together into a sort of boat in which a load of freight
would be carried. On arrival at the settlements the freight was
delivered to the consignees and then the boat taken apart and
sold for building material. On the flat boats, with Buchanan,
Angus worked till the river froze.</p>

<p>In the winter there were dances even those who did not dance
at home in Scotland (such as some of Lowland birth, descendants
of old Covenanting families) dancing out there. You would hear
the fiddles going and from the doorways the voices of those who
called the dances: <i>First lady and first gentleman--balance;
first lady and first gentleman--both hands; first couple down the
line;</i> and wildly went the fiddles. <i>Second couple down the
line;</i> and merrily went the fiddles. <i>All hands
round</i>--gaily they danced by Red River then. Strathspeys and
reels, the Highland schottische and quadrilles they danced,
wearing their tartans (that had been prohibited in Scotland in
the '45 but were still worn a hundred years later), and glancing
to the door sometimes you would see the dark faces of Indians
looking in, coveting the colours. There was a wild jig, the Red
River Jig, a great favourite with the <i>M&eacute;tis</i>--French
half-breeds. And now and then some Indians would give their own
dances, and when the drums beat and their feet thudded out the
rhythms, the queerest thoughts and emotions would come to Angus.
He could hardly put a name on it. It seemed he had heard these
lilts, and danced to them, too, in a time forgotten that the
sound of them set him struggling inwardly to remember--which was
a feeling, thought he, too ridiculous to tell to any.</p>

<p>All the winter Mrs. Munro had been none too well, which was a
regret to them all--for most people newly arrived found the air a
tonic, had a fresh joy in life. She, on the contrary, seemed to
lose hold of it. Daniel suspected that much of her trouble was
mental. Surreptitiously she brooded, he believed.</p>

<p>"I think," said he to her one day, "you have never forgotten,
Kate, what I said when we were leaving--"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a catch in her voice.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" she cried out. "I have never
said."</p>

<p>"It's just a thought I have," he replied. Today he might have
called it telepathy. "I believe you brood upon it."</p>

<p>"If the coronach had not begun right on the heels of your
crying out so--" she said, admitting he was right in his surmise,
but stopped there, left the rest in air.</p>

<p>They did not know Angus had entered, and he, hearing this,
backed out, left them, much as he had retreated from them that
last day at Brendan when he came on them side by side bowed to
the window, peering along the slopes.</p>

<p>In the spring, after the ice had broken and was tinkling and
crashing away down river, when the snow was off the plains and
flowers were showing, Mr. Munro thought a jaunt or two might help
his wife, put the colour in her lips again. So they went, all
three, driving west to visit a further Scots settlement out on
the prairies. The land was still wet from the thaw, the wheels
drawing up mud as they revolved, and it fell in gobbets with a
clapping sound, but there was nothing of the <i>snell</i> in the
air. A fine fresh day it was to breathe. "This," thought Daniel,
"should do her good."</p>

<p>Over a little rise (for rises there were, as they discovered
on travelling, waves in that sea of grass) they came suddenly to
a small lake of the kind called <i>slough.</i> It was not the
usual ducks that clucked there but some birds, gray-blue and
white, that rose, yammering. Sea-gulls here--and so far inland!
Mrs. Munro put chin on chest to hide sudden tears, but her
shoulders shook with sobbing.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" her husband exclaimed, drawing rein.
"Are you in pain, Kate? What has taken you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered.</p>

<p>"But it must be something," he insisted.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, biting on her lips and trying to stem
the flow by pressing her eyelids closer. That was one of the last
pictures Angus had of her--crying like a bairn. Here was a sad
downfall for the woman who had talked of <i>going proudly,</i>
but a far cry it was for her to home and the sea gulls weaving
their silvery reflections in the waters of Loch Brendan. The life
at Brendan had been hard--but it was home, and there was an end
of it! She seemed like a little girl in grievous trouble.</p>

<p>"The gulls took me by surprise," she said in a small
voice.</p>

<p>No need to explain why the surprise of these birds caused her
to sob. Her husband and son both knew the picture that would be
in her mind. Daniel put an arm round her.</p>

<p>"If we made money enough we might take you back again," said
he. "It won't be Loch Brendan, but somewhere in Scotland--in the
old land."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, "you should be angry with me, not kind to
me. I'm a child and should be whipped!"</p>

<p>That night Angus dreamt that all the blinds were down at the
windows and he was trying to raise them but they would not budge.
In this dream he went from one to another, from room to room, and
for all his trying not a blind could he raise.</p>

<p>The malady that carried her off would today be called
pernicious anaemia. She had no appetite, and nothing that she
forced herself to eat gave her sustenance. She was always tired,
though she never complained of it.</p>

<p>Angus, as soon as the river was open again, only a few days
after that drive, had gone back to the flat-boat work, and it was
but on the third or fourth trip that he knew, as they sculled
into the bank, that something was wrong. It was a boy with a
fishing-rod--or a fishing-pole, as they used to say, a slender,
sappy tree branch with line and hook pendant--who broke the news
to him, the Fraser boy, Hector, tuft of hair sticking out of a
hole in his hat. He dropped the fishing-pole as the flat boat was
sculled close to the bank and stared with wide eyes, no smile in
response to Angus's wave. Then he clapped hands to mouth,
trumpet-fashion, and began to shout:</p>

<p>"You're to come home at once!
You're--to--come--home--at--once! I've been watching for you
yesterday and today, too!"</p>

<p>"Something wrong," said Buchanan.</p>

<p>"Something wrong," said Angus.</p>

<p>"You're to come up at once," shouted Hector excitedly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Angus as they pulled in and he made
passes with a boat hook at their jetty.</p>

<p>"It's your mother. You're to come at once."</p>

<p>"You go," said Buchanan.</p>

<p>Angus leapt ashore and climbed the bank, Hector leaving his
home-made fishing-rod lying there and hurrying after him. On the
point of asking the boy for more detail Angus let the inquiries
go. Hector seemed to be both youthfully elated over his task of
herald and youthfully perturbed. The slapping of his bare feet
and, anon, his panting, died away as Angus hurried to the house.
At the door was Mrs. Fraser, head lowered, shading her eyes from
the low blinding rays of the setting sun. She stepped back as he
drew near.</p>

<p>"Go right in to her," said she, with no greeting save that.
"I've had Hector waiting for you since yesterday lest you came
early."</p>

<p>He did not ask why she was so anxious for his return. Her face
told him. His mother, thought he, must be dying. The bedroom door
was ajar, and as he stepped in, his father, sitting by the bed,
looked up at him, his life's great agony in his eyes. Standing at
the bed-foot was the doctor, a commiserate man, pity in his
bearing, distress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Munro was in the article of death.</p>

<p>"She will tak' nae nourishment," the Scots physician's voice
came huskily. "If she could but have taken into her blood some
nourishment . . ." His voice dropped, and in a tone of sad
complaint he ended, "but she will not assimilate."</p>

<p>She seemed to be in a coma and yet, thought Angus, there was a
recognition in her eyes through the new opacity that he could not
but observe with piercing concern. It was as though the candle of
her life guttered, flared--and sank. She drew a breath of
content, or of restfulness, then another, desperately.</p>

<p>"Can ye lift me?" she asked in the merest whisper. "Can ye
lift me that I could see the hills?"</p>

<p>Munro looked at his son. Angus looked at his father. To see
the hills! They bent over her to do as she asked. As they raised
her she had again knowledge of where she was, lost, apparently,
these last moments.</p>

<p>"There are no hills," she murmured. "I forgot I was here," and
tears came to her eyes.</p>

<p>It was then, as they laid her back, that her spirit, her
shadow passed, tears in her eyes that she could not see the hills
of home. Someone at a distance began an evening's practice on the
pipes. Perhaps she heard it and, slipping away toward
unconsciousness thought that she was back in Brendan and falling
asleep there.</p>

<p>It had been their intention on arrival, after discussion of
plans with the Frasers, to take up their own land that spring,
but the death of Mrs. Munro caused that to be deferred. Daniel
had no heart, as well they realized, to go on with that matter
for some time. So, though Ian had not continued with the
wheelwright, Daniel continued to work on the Fraser farm. There
was enough for them both to do.</p>

<p>But Munro was never to take up land there, no more than six
feet of it beside his wife. Only three months after Kate had gone
her husband followed her. Just a year to the day from the day of
their arrival he passed away after a stroke in the hot field
where he was working.</p>

<p>The bearers, at his funeral, made up for the abstemiousness
with which, in deference to her views, they had carried Kate
kirkward. There were but four of these bearers, two to a side,
and with them walked four others to relieve them from time to
time. Seldom was a coffin taken in a cart and the Fraser home was
some way from the church. There were oatcakes and whisky before
the start, and when they carried him out all were rosy. Daniel
was a big man, and sooner than usual Ian Fraser, master of the
ceremonies, seeing the bearers were hunched to the handles, gave
the cry:</p>

<p>"Relief!"</p>

<p>The two on each side who had been but keeping slow step took
their places, and the four who fell out had their dram before all
moved on again. A few hundred yards on there was again the
chant:</p>

<p>"Relief!"</p>

<p>The bearers fell out, and had their dram, as did the mourners,
halted behind, and on went the procession once more.</p>

<p>"Aye, he was a great man," one remarked. "I believe he weighed
twa hunner wi' the breath o' life in him; and with the kist
weighing--"</p>

<p>"Wheesht!"</p>

<p>It did not matter to Angus, though. Even then there was that
in him which developed in the years till the time came when he
could hear what would have irked, angered, or hurt him as a lad
and pay no heed.</p>

<p>"Relief!"</p>

<p>"No, no, I'll have nae mair now till we get him bedded. For
the credit of the corp I mauna stagger."</p>

<p>"Wheesht!"</p>

<p>There was a great turnout, of Highland and Lowland, and when
they met any French half-breeds upon the way these stood to one
side and, uncovering, crossed themselves. Even some Indians,
encountered riding into the settlement, reined in and sat by the
road wrapped in their blankets, like men turned suddenly to
painted effigies, with heads all bowed.</p>

<p>"Relief!"</p>

<p>There were two pipers ahead, at the kirk gate, and as the
procession drew near they began to play. Angus felt he might have
been spared that. To him death needed no pageantry, no music. He
feared then that he was about to make a fool of himself, but
there came into his mind, "We'll go proudly," and he took hold of
himself and saw his father to rest like a man, then came away to
a consciousness--temporarily muted, as a new wound is often
accompanied, at first, by a stunning of the nerves--of being
alone (father and mother taken from him within three months),
which, many friends though he had, was never rightly to leave him
all his days.</p>

<p>The first to speak to him was Captain Buchanan, for whom he
had been working on the flat-boats. Buchanan was very drunk and
when he was drunk he seemed to be aware of all the sadness of
life. Never did Angus see him taciturn in liquor, only plaintive
and fuddedly compassionate, never what they call <i>greeting
fou.</i> He came with a lurch alongside of Angus, who was walking
home with Ian Fraser, and said he, with a hiccup:</p>

<p>"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. We have all got to
come to it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Aye. But what I want
to say tae you is something practical."</p>

<p>He flapped a hand in air before his eyes.</p>

<p>"Some other time maybe, whatever," suggested Ian gently.</p>

<p>"You're richt! This is not the moment," said Buchanan. "I'll
come and see you the morn's morn. I want to see you special."</p>

<p>With a hiccup he dropped behind again. In silence Angus and
Ian walked on, a faint murmur, a faint whisper of voices and
shuffle of feet in the dusty road to rear. Ever and again came
also the hiccup of Captain Buchanan, and when that sounded,
Fraser would glance at Angus and mutter, embarrassed, "Aye--aye,"
or "Indeet, indeet. Yess, yess," very sad for the lad's sake.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c03">CHAPTER THREE</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>To the Mountains</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Ian Fraser had fancied that Buchanan was so fuddled at the
funeral that his promise to call and see Angus would be entirely
forgotten by him, but there he was, next day, <i>speiring</i>, as
he would say, for the lad.</p>

<p>Angus was <i>out by.</i> He was dimly at work on some
tinkering, alone in the tool shed, and there Buchanan found him,
coming in at the door very sober and sedate, looking as though he
had suffered personal loss, but managing, with gaze on the floor
or in distance, to come speedily to the business that brought him
there. He had received an offer, he explained, sitting down on a
keg of nails and filling his pipe with deliberation, to go to the
far end of these plains that lay to west of them--"to the
boat-building there," said he.</p>

<p>Angus thought for a moment that his caller was not sober as he
seemed. Boat-building away inland on those prairies! Then he
remembered that through that West country rivers ran, and that
they were great enough and sufficiently free of rapids for long
distances for heavier craft to ply on them than the canoes of the
company--these buoyant canoes that were paddled and portaged from
Hudson's Bay and from Fort William (by Rainy Lake and Lake of the
Woods) to Fort Garry, and by Portage la Prairie away into the
chain of rivers toward remote Swan Lake and beyond.</p>

<p>Buchanan was to take a man or two with him, he explained, able
at the work; the pay, he added, was good.</p>

<p>"It would be a change for you," he declared, with a nod and a
quick glance. "It would take your mind from--aye," he ended.
"What say ye?"</p>

<p>Angus told him he appreciated his thought and his kindness. At
that Buchanan rose, and staring out of the window remarked that
he would like fine if they could start on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>"Here's Tuesday," said he, wheeled, and walked to the
door.</p>

<p>Angus followed him. They stood there a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll be ready," said Angus.</p>

<p>"That's fine, then," replied Buchanan, and departed, leaving
the young man to his tinkering and his thoughts.</p>

<p>With his employer going away from Red River he--were he to
remain--would have to seek a new job, and there had always been a
spell for him in that curve of sky over the space to west, as if
with a still small voice it called him. He would be sorry to
leave the Frasers. He had come to look upon them as close kindred
rather than as the "forty-second cousins" that they were. The
children had called his father <i>uncle.</i> He liked the callant
Hector. He liked the baby Flora, and very greatly he liked Fiona,
who would come to him in the evenings, book in hand, and say
"Will you hearken me my lessons?" There was a Sunday when she had
asked him to <i>hearken her</i> a psalm.</p>

<p>"<i>Thus spake the sheriff</i>--" she began.</p>

<p>"The seraph," Angus had corrected.</p>

<p>"<i>Thus spake the sheriff</i>--"</p>

<p>"The seraph."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Thus spake the seraph and forthwith appeared a shining
throne</i>--"</p>

<p>"A shining throng--throng."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Thus spake the sheriff</i>--I mean seraph--<i>and
forthwith appeared a shining throng.</i> Perhaps I had better
know, if you please, what a seraph is. That might help."</p>

<p>Yes, he would miss the family life of the Frasers.</p>

<p>There was a ring that Mrs. Munro had worn on her third finger,
in the collet the hair of her husband's mother. Daniel's father
had had it made, a fine piece of work by an Edinburgh goldsmith
after his wife's death--on its inner surface the initials of his
and her Christian names in monogram--and Daniel, inheriting it,
had given it to Kate as wedding ring. When she died Mrs. Fraser
had taken it from her hand and kept it to give to Daniel later.
He, however had not worn it, put it away; but alone in the world,
Angus--finding it among his father's few treasures--put it on his
little finger. He had no near kin left, but the sight of that
ring, the feel of it, to turn it round sometimes on his finger in
those days of desolation, seemed to help, mitigated the sense of
solitariness somehow. It gave him two generations of his folk for
secret company.</p>

<p>The party consisted of Mr. Buchanan, two half-breeds (of
French and Saulteaux blood), who were known only by their
Christian names of Pierre and Aloysius, Tom Renwick, a
fellow-worker on the flat-boats with them, Sam Lovat Douglas, and
Angus.</p>

<p>Douglas--he who was later to become Sir Samuel
Lovat-Douglas--had just arrived at Fort Garry on his way to Fort
Edmonton, with a wallet of letters of introduction to factors and
such throughout the land (to William McTavish, the governor of
Assiniboia for the company, Mackay of Fort Ellice, Lillie of Fort
Carlton, Chantelaine of Fort Pitt, Hardisty of Fort Edmonton,
Macaulay of Jasper House, and Colin Fraser of St. Ann's), and
hearing that Buchanan was westward bound had made arrangements
with him to go with them. Douglas, in his early twenties Angus
judged, was heavily built at that time, with a powerful
frame--and a geniality of manner somehow suggesting rather the
plausible than the candid. Clearly he was in the country on
business bent, but to ask direct questions of a man was not the
usage in those days. As a matter of fact Angus was not curious.
If a man had no desire to disclose his affairs--then it was
nothing to do with him. Yet it was to Angus that Douglas revealed
the object of his journey. It was on the night they stopped at
the Touchwood Hills post--that shortly afterwards was abandoned
by the company and left to crumble in the weather and the
seasons.</p>

<p>"I'm verra glad," said Douglas in that friendly way of his,
"to have your company on this odyssey--and I hope you mak' weel
at the boat-building. Some fools tell me that in a new land a man
should take the first job that turns up. Well there may be
something in that; but I'm no' eager to take the first job lest I
stay in it. You see what I mean? Man, I'm ambeetious!"</p>

<p>The others were over at the post for company and a chat there
(to the official in charge at the Touchwood Hills House, Douglas
had no letter), and they were alone at the night fire. Its flames
illumined the heavy forehead, the heavy jowl, the dancing and
genial eyes of Sam Douglas.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'm here for?" he asked. "I'll tell you. You
haven't tried to pump me to find out, so I'll tell you," and he
laughed. "This country is going to open up--to develop. What have
we seen so far? Buffaloes by the hundred, and these two
half-breeds whooping <i>Voila les boeufs! Voila les
boeufs!</i>"</p>

<p>"An odd fellow," thought Angus. "He seems to be acting." (Not
but what he had already a liking for Sam.) "Even his Scots burr
he seems to accentuate deliberately at times--as now, when we are
alone together, for example. Something a trifle humbugging about
him, is there? Something of insincerity in his ingratiating
manner? And yet, isn't it easier to get along with one who would
fain be a good fellow than with one who is sulky and
taciturn?"</p>

<p>Thus was Angus thinking as Douglas paused there by the fire
beside him on a buffalo robe, gazing into the flames.</p>

<p>"Aye, buffaloes," Sam went on after a pause. "And antelope
louping over the prairie, and a few bit villages of the Crees in
their leather tents. But consider how the buffalo are being
killed off. They are no' just for the sustenance of the Indians
now. The trade that has sprung up in their robes as they call
these pelts," and he stroked the one on which he sat, "is going
to exterminate them; and the railroad builders down in the States
are feeding the navvies on buffalo meat. Mark my words. Man, man,
my mind is of the kind that is aye just a jump ahead--maybe
<i>twa jumps.</i> There's going to be cattle grazing on these
buffalo pastures before long. And there are going to be fixed
habitations--fixed habitations. But what are the folks going to
burn to keep them warm in wintertime? It's a cold winter here.
Buffalo chips? Na. And there's not sufficient wood in the river
bottoms to last them long when they come in here in great
numbers, as come they will. I'm looking for coal. My mind is of
the kind that goes jumping ahead! Aye, <i>burning rocks.</i> I
heard of burning rocks from an Indian on the Missouri. They have
coal there; and he told me there were burning rocks up here to
north also. But it's no' safe to travel up through the Blackfoot
country, as ye ken, so I went back doon the Missouri and over to
the Red River and Fort Garry, and I'm going to see these burning
rocks in the north. That's what I'm here for, sir. I'm thinking
of the future. I'm planning big."</p>

<p>It was young man's talk, perhaps, and as the years passed he
might be more minded to keep his own counsel; but many were the
young men in the land, then, engaged on affairs onerous and
dangerous--factors and explorers of the company hardly more than
striplings. All the difference between them and him was that they
were in the service of others, and he already was, as they say,
playing a lone hand.</p>

<p>Doubt in him suddenly intruded unhappily into Angus's liking
for him when, after a lull in talk during which they but sat
smoking there by the fire, the talk resumed came somehow to the
subject of the stipends paid by the Hudson's Bay to its factors
and clerks.</p>

<p>"A small stipend," declared Douglas, as though he were an aged
promoter and experienced financier, "and the promise of a fair
pension is the idea. You see, it makes a man work well to know
his old-age is provided for if he behaves himself--and, actually,
he may never live to have the pension. If I was head of a big
company I'd run it on those lines. It would be benevolent, you
see, to arrange for the pension--and, as I say, only a percentage
would get one. That's to be considered."</p>

<p>"You would not, then, pay the pension to widows of your
employees?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>Sam Douglas rubbed a hand over his face.</p>

<p>"That would have to be thought over," he replied, and
dismissed the subject by rising to prepare his blankets for the
night, the sound of the fumbling steps and the voices of the
others drawing near them from the direction of the post.</p>

<p>Rumours of Blackfeet raiders in the region when they reached
Fort Carlton ordained a continuance together toward Edmonton,
with the intention of passing southward, thence, to the Mountain
House; but at Fort Pitt there was a dark-eyed young man, the
half-breed son of one of the factors, who was setting out across
country for Rocky Mountain House. He was known to the Blackfeet.
(His mother was, in fact, a Piegan woman--which is to say
Blackfoot, the Blackfeet being, as Angus had it explained to him,
a tribe in three parts: the Blackfeet proper, the Bloods, and the
Piegans, all speaking a common tongue.) So there they said
farewell to Douglas and the half-breeds, striking out west, south
of Beaver Lake, by the Dried Meat Hills, Buffalo Lake, the Red
Deer River's upper waters, and Gull Lake--new names to Angus,
with the life of the land in the sound of them.</p>

<p>For some reason or another Douglas's parting remark remained
hauntingly in the young man's ears.</p>

<p>"I hope you mak' weel at the boat-building," said Sam.</p>

<p>"And I hope you find your coal that you are going to make a
fortune over--by and by," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"Oh, sooner than you think!" Douglas told him.</p>

<p>There seemed at the time and in the remembrance as he rode on
to be an ironic note in the words, <i>I hope you mak' weel at the
boat-building.</i> Did Douglas want, all friendly at parting, to
spur Angus on, to make him think further than the day's board and
bed? "Some folks tell me that in a new land a man should take the
first job that turns up, but I'm no' eager to take the first job
lest I stay in it." That also Douglas had said. He may have
intended, at parting, a jog to his new friend toward looking
ahead, <i>planning big.</i></p>

<p>It was a little way beyond Gull Lake, coming to an eminence,
that Angus had one of his experiences, these experiences that he
told to no one but that went (more than other ones apparently
less airy, less unsubstantial) to the making of what he was to
become in the drift of the years. It was an experience of the
spirit kin with that which had privately befallen him over a year
before when the odours of the new land, before they had sighted
it, came out to meet them through a white vapour over the sea,
into which the steamer's siren bleated. By the olfactory nerves
had come that one. By the eyes came this, with the gift of a
secret ecstasy.</p>

<p>Before him the Rocky Mountains were suddenly revealed beyond
belts of colour that were of woods, parklands, wedges of
sky-reflecting water, twist of river, fragment of distant lake.
Very much as it was with him when listening to music was it with
him then, gazing on the scene before him. Music would pick and
choose through the past years of his life, recover and toss to
him this, that and the other: the tone of a voice, the light on a
pebble, a forgotten wail of wind in a chimney from a winter storm
of years back, the glance of eyes (Jessie's, no doubt), the gleam
through water of a herring shoal--and leave it to him to make
something of the medley.</p>

<p>He thought of his father's remark--<i>Scotland, a kingdom of
the mind.</i> Scotland was not his. They would not have him
there. Well, he had Scotland still, the bark of seals on the
Black Rocks, the remembered smell of sun-scorched bracken, of
peat-smoke beaten down in the gales. He thought of the vast
Atlantic swaying like a compass disc betwixt the rise and fall of
Scotland's seaweed fringe and the scent of pines, firs and cedars
in the mists off Newfoundland. Of the curve of the Milky Way he
thought, seen from their prairie camps at night, a whirl of
sparks from the Arctic shores to the Caribbean. Of the columns
and whip-lashes of light, up to the zenith and gone, of the
Aurora Borealis, seen after hot summer days of their journey (not
only in winter as many believed), he thought as he reined in his
horse and sat motionless staring from that butte beyond Gull Lake
at the revelation of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Something happened to him beyond his power to express;
something happened, wordless, like music. As though the blue of
the sky had run and thickened roughly at the base, there lay the
ranges, low in contrast with the height of that space of blue
but--he aware of how far off they were--majestic in their serene
extent. They dropped away to south, they dropped away to north,
as into a quiet eternity. Here and there slashes of white showed
among their purple. Here and there rocky gables twinkled like
mirrors, and at one place, far in, there was a dun seething,
peaks turning to cloud and clouds solidifying into peaks. A
lightning flash was drawn in quick gold on that portion where
peaks and clouds fused, and then came a distant sound, the
faintest rumble.</p>

<p>But he could not stay there all day, his spirit and the
sighing of the wind in the grass blending as sky and mountains
blent in that section of storm on the ranges. Men and horses
ahead were dwindling to the size of ants, passing away in a
steady jig-jog with the rhythmic swing of long tails, the slight
sway of the riders' shoulders and of the balanced packs. After
that vision they would soon be at journey's end.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, next morning, just one calendar month from
the day they started out from Red River that, cresting a knoll,
they saw beyond a twist of river the towers of Rocky Mountain
House.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was as the summer changed into autumn in the year '57 that
Angus came to Rocky Mountain House and already the place had its
history, though the signs of it were splintered in wood instead
of being chiselled in more ancient stone. Here were no granite
peel towers, only those wooden watch bastions. Here was no Roman
Wall such as crumbled through the centuries betwixt Clyde and
Forth, no ruined keep such as sat by the side of the Wee Cumbrae,
gazing hollow at its double on the mainland. But in the logs of
Rocky Mountain House already, when young Munro came there, was a
silver gray veneer of the weather that silently told him dead
men's hands had hewn them and set them up. The scene in which the
fort sat--with its history, recent in comparison with the history
of his homeland--spoke beyond record, it seemed, spoke from the
beginnings of the world, prehistoric days, the early ages. There
lay the eternal mountains--higher than Grampians, if obvious
comparisons were to be made--and in the twilight the bay of a
timber wolf came as it were from a time before Bruce, before
Hakon, of whom his mother had known the legends.</p>

<p>Here had come one Pangman, and on an old pine close by had cut
his name and hewn the date: <i>Peter Pangman, 1790.</i> Here, in
the days before the amalgamation of the Hudson's Bay Company (the
Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into
Hudson's Bay) and the Northwest Fur Company, Alexander Henry of
the latter (known as Alexander Henry the Younger, to distinguish
him from his roving uncle) had fuddled a party of Piegan Indians
with whisky into which he decanted laudanum, making them
incapable of going on toward the Rockies to intercept David
Thompson, who was then on his way to trade with their enemies
through the passes. And what would David Thompson, Angus
wondered, have thought of these methods, listening to it all and
hearing, anon, of that curious man of brain, heart, and sinew who
refused to serve liquor to the natives?</p>

<p>The factor of the house entertained them often with these old
stories as the evenings drew in, telling of how Thompson once,
importuned by his friends to take kegs of rum to trade away off
in the land of the Kootenays, stampeded the horses so that they
dashed under tree branches, smashing the barrels, then wrote a
letter--that would get back to his partners he knew not when, nor
by what hands--telling of the <i>accident</i> and, glad that he
had found a way not to debase the natives with fire-water, sat
down to his lonely evening fire in the glow of resinous
pine-knots to read a chapter from the pocket Bible he carried
along with him. There was a legend of him having arrived at the
Mountain House once from one of his expeditions beyond the
mountains, that had been in winter, downcast greatly at the
treatment accorded to the sledge-dogs--a humane man.</p>

<p>"What was he like to look at?" Angus asked, and was given a
description of him--broad shoulders, deep-set eyes, high forehead
and across it his fair hair cut bang-fashion.</p>

<p>The ghost of David Thompson, the shadow of David Thompson,
moved for him always thereafter against the background of these
silver-gray logs. There was also a peppering of history in them,
gouged holes that had been made by no woodpeckers' beaks but were
souvenirs of occasions when Cree and Blackfeet, unhappily
arriving simultaneously, fought round its walls.</p>

<p>At the fort they had fires of coal--which Douglas had gone
seeking; and there were men whose duty was to go to the outcrop a
little way back and pick it out, pack it to the House. As for the
<i>burning rocks:</i> Angus discovered that the Indians called
them so not because they at any place, so far, mined and burned
coal themselves, but because there were certain areas ignited no
doubt by bush fires, that smouldered away, glowing by night in
deep crevices and raising their pillar of smoke by day. Had Sam
Douglas read more in the journals of the old explorers he would
not have needed an Indian's account of burning rocks to send him
on his quest. That coal was in the land had been known and noted
by travellers long ago--Franklin, Peter Fiddler and Mackenzie
among them. Seams had been smouldering to the knowledge of white
folk for a hundred years, and according to the legends before
that, time out of mind.</p>

<p>Less was Angus impressed by any feeling of lack of history in
the land than by the sense of the prehistoric there.</p>

<p>News of the outer world--near and far--they heard and
discussed. The territory of Kansas was still, it seemed, a
troubled place to live in with the settlers from the free and
those from the anti-slavery states at loggerheads, drawing their
guns over their differences. There was trouble in Europe, as
always. There was war between France and Sardinia, France and
Austria. There were wranglings over the provinces of Nice and
Savoy. They heard of that fracas and, anon, that it was over,
then that another was brewing in Sicily; and Victor Emmanuel and
Garibaldi were discussed on the banks of the Saskatchewan. More
distant, sometimes, seemed to Angus the people of these discords
and bloodshed than the folk of Venus (if folk there were on that
planet), setting in a clear sky beyond the Rockies.</p>

<p>When the Blackfeet came north to trade there was ceremonial,
the factor going out to meet them with a gift of tobacco. As
sharing salt to the Arab was whiffing from the same pipe to them.
The chief would accept the gift, fill his sacred pipe, and the
sub-chiefs and the factor would smoke, with a dignified
observance in the pointing of the stem, even in the manner of
handling it and in the direction of its circuit--<i>with the
sun</i>--"Much as we white men," remarked the factor, "have a
ritual in the birling of the wine round the table."</p>

<p>In the earlier days--of the Northwest Fur Company, when rum
was much used in trade--there was great care exercised in letting
the Indians, of whatever tribe, into the Fort. A few at a time
they passed into the trade-room and up in the galleries company
employees were secreted with primed rifles at hand. When the rum
was in the tomahawk was often out. The Indian had to be taught to
like the spirit, and when the extensive use of it was
discontinued he had a grievance--that he was not given it. He
would demand, with murder in his eyes. Dreadful and dowie doings
there had been in that place of lonely grandeur. To avoid these
clashes of tribes at enmity the company's officers tried to keep
the trade of the Plains Cree to Forts Edmonton, Pitt and Carlton
(the woods Crees went chiefly to Carlton and &agrave;-la-Corne),
of the Eastern Assiniboine to Qu'Appelle, of the Saulteaux to
Forts Ellice and Pelly. Rocky Mountain House, by the company's
desire, was for the Blackfeet confederacy and for the Sarcees
(who seemed, by their speech, to be a southern band of the
Chippewyans--the Tinnhes--of the northern lakes), and the Western
Assiniboines, generally called the Stonys. But Crees still came
there at times, even as roving Sarcee and Blackfeet would dare to
go as far as the core of their northern enemy's lands--Fort
Edmonton.</p>

<p>Never, so far, either at Red River or at the Mountain House,
had Angus been homesick for Brendan, because of the melancholy of
crushing conditions of the life of his people there. Yet a day
came on which, at the sound of a place-name, he had--if but for a
moment--a pang at his heart, a realization of being far from
home, and he understood how his mother would ache for Scotland
despite their misery there. There arrived at the Fort a man with
a marked Highland accent who, on being asked whence he came,
replied "Dunvegan," which Angus took for Dunvegan in Skye, and
had a vision as of all the Hebrides with trailing mists, quiet
glens, and sea lochs huzzaing with a homing tide.</p>

<p>"Dunvegan," said he--homesick.</p>

<p>"Yess--north of Fort Edmonton, on the Peace River it iss."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you meant Dunvegan in the Isle of Skye."</p>

<p>"No, no, I've never been in Scotland. I was born in
Glengarry--Upper Canada," he added quickly, with a laugh, noting
a look of puzzlement on Angus's face.</p>

<p>He was descended, no doubt, from others cast out of their
homes as his folk had been--and the brief homesickness
passed.</p>

<p>In talk of those who had been before him in these parts he
learnt much of their marital affairs--their blanket marriages,
their prayer-book marriages, their registered unions: the
varieties of marriage observances and plain concubinage.
High-placed men, he heard, in the service of all the trading
companies--the old Northwest Fur Company, the X.Y. Company, the
Hudson's Bay Company, had taken Indian women as wife or as
concubine--and some, when their time of living in the west was
finished, left women and half-breed weans behind, while others
took theirs east with them.</p>

<p>Tom Renwick voiced plump and plain the view that if a man must
have a woman he might as well visit the Indian camps and find
some temporarily obliging and clean squaw without any legal
proceedings whatever. There were older men present and Angus
wondered how such a suggestion struck them. There was a marked
silence--and it occurred to him that perhaps they were
considering that Tom's view was a sound one, but that it would
have been better for a junior not to have expressed it.</p>

<p>"This young man's dogma," said the factor, wagging his head at
Renwick, "is apt to lead to trouble. You be careful, Tom, of
acting upon that conception in some of these Indian
villages."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of it personally, sir," replied
Renwick.</p>

<p>"Hum!" said the factor.</p>

<p>"I believe that with a white-man marriage," Buchanan remarked,
"a squaw has a tendency, as time slips along, to be dictatorial.
Marry one according to their own rites and it's no' so bad. I'm
told. She'll be aye a wee bit uncertain if the white man feels
wholly bound. Give them a ceremony before a priest or a clergyman
and there is, I doot, that tendency. A squaw with a marriage
certificate in her hand is apt to become heap big
chieftainess."</p>

<p>"That applies," the factor pointed out, laughing, "to some
white women, too. I doubt if it is typical."</p>

<p>"They are, of course, savages--<i>les sauvages</i>," said
Buchanan.</p>

<p>"Daniel William Harmon said--" began the factor.</p>

<p>Daniel William Harmon: Angus had never so much as heard the
name, yet the factor spoke it as though almost to quote an
authority. Some, in Angus's position, might have damned Mr.
Harmon and his opinions at a venture, but instead of that he
reminded himself that little did he know of this west to which he
had come; and desiring to know more he was <i>all ears</i> and
his gaze was eager on the speaker's face.</p>

<p>"Daniel William Harmon said that hospitality to strangers he
had found to be among the Indian virtues, and that he had been
treated with more real politeness by them than is commonly shown
to strangers in the so-called civilized world."</p>

<p>"Well, Harmon certainly knew both," said one of the
clerks.</p>

<p>The factor went on to talk of one and the other--giving them
their names, Harmon and Sir Alexander Mackenzie among them--who
had married Indian women, and these not eastern Indians long in
touch with white people, but Indians of the Great Plains; and
that talk sooner than he had any premonition (premonition, in
fact, he had none) was to be turned over and over in Angus's
mind.</p>

<p>When the snow was beginning to creep down on the range of the
Rockies westward with that amazing straight line as though ruled
along the mountains where upper whiteness and lower green met,
Buchanan, Renwick and Angus went off to the hunting of
white-tailed deer in the wooded country.</p>

<p>Over gray and brown pebbles a stream came down through the
forests. The place belonged to antiquity. The stands of deciduous
trees among the evergreen conifers were yellowing, autumn having
come, and Indian summer might hold all in exquisite trance for a
month or more. As they rode down to that stream, their
pack-horses laden with the kill of deer, there was an odour of
burning wood, red-willow smoke. There, in a natural meadow, a
green gusset by a curve of the hurrying water, was an Indian
encampment, a cluster of tepees, the leather ones of that
epoch.</p>

<p>There had, by the signs, been a meal recently eaten in the
open. No smoke came from the tepees, but a fire crumbled into ash
before them, sending up, as is the way of red-willow well alight,
more of odour than of smoke into the air. A mere sift of blue, a
haze of blue, ascended from that natural meadow in a thin long
wisp, and was caught by the draught of the stream's passage,
drawn away trembling above its flow, a pennant of blue twining
above the twinings of the creek so that its further course could
be traced some distance by that gauzy riband among the tree-tops.
Little did Angus realize how even that, remembered in days to
come, would importune him till it was as though a voice called in
his dreams, <i>Come back.</i></p>

<p>He and his two companions rode down to the water's edge. The
Indians had been hunting also and in the creek-bed were many
hides held down by stones. Others, pegged to the ground, or
stretched upon upright wicker frames, the women were scraping
clean. By the lodges sat the men, some idling after the hunt, one
making arrows--running the shafts back and forth, to assure them
straight, through a stone in the centre of which was a circular
hole. The horses of the white men whinnied to the horses of the
Indians. The horses of the Indians answered back, looking up from
their grazing, displaying white splashes on broad foreheads and
Roman noses--these descendants of Arab sires.</p>

<p>The Indians scarce looked up. They might, by their manner,
have been unaware of indication that anyone was coming, going on
with the straightening of arrow shafts, the chipping of fat from
hides. The three men paused at the creekside, their pack-string
loping ahead and craning necks to drink, then the saddle horses
craning down, so that the riders sat forward, hands extended with
the reins. They knew these people and, as the animals drank, when
one or another of the band glanced toward them they raised their
hands in the customary signs of greeting, either the palm held
upward--the sign of peace (a hand with no weapon in it)--or with
the first two fingers elevated and slightly oscillated, the sign
for two people, friends, together.</p>

<p>The pack horses, having drunk, waited with dripping muzzles
for direction, and were driven by Tom Renwick through the stream
on to the meadow and across it, past the camp to the further
ford. Buchanan reined in a moment to hail an elderly man, Chief
Red Shield.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Chief!" he called. "You get deer?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" replied Red Shield, his face wrinkling in a
smile.</p>

<p>Buchanan rode on, pointing a finger at two children that
balanced at the lodge door sucking their thumbs, staring at him,
and--"Boo, boo!" he chanted at them, an old squaw looking from
the solemn children to the jocund white man and rippling
laughter.</p>

<p>That was the day when Angus first saw Minota.</p>

<p>In some impulse he glanced round and there, a little way up
the creek, was an Indian girl dressed in the manner of the time,
which was part native, part white, with fringed deerskin kirtle
over deer-skin leggings, and a print flower-patterned bodice from
the company's trade-rooms. Her head was bound with a blue
bandana, thick plaits of hair hanging on either side. Hand on
hip, head canted, she was watching him; and when their eyes met
she did not look away.</p>

<p>Angus smiled at her and after a moment, when it seemed she was
not going to respond, she did, then looked toward one of the
elder women at work upon a hide. To her, then, Munro turned and
was just in time to realize she had seen and was pretending utter
engrossment in her task.</p>

<p>Quiet he was, following Renwick and Buchanan through the
forest that flounced these slopes, aware of the smell of balsam
in the dusky hush, seeing the tree shadows rippling over the
backs of the two in front, rippling over the horses' haunches,
keenly alive to scent and sound, the click of a hoof on a stone
in the dust of the forest floor. The roar of the creek had fallen
away. Surely the silence of that forest was older than the Roman
Wall. As he rode he thought of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, of whom
he had often heard with his Indian woman, and of Harmon, whose
name was new to him, with his.</p>

<p>Next day when they were in camp the horses, tearing grass
close by, became restless, raising their heads, snorting.</p>

<p>"Somebody coming," said Buchanan.</p>

<p>There between the tree boles above them was a movement.
Laughter came down, rippling laughter of Indian women, the deep
brief laugh of a man. It was their friends again, Red Shield's
band. Pack ponies tittuped past, laden with rolled hides. Young
men following them, swaying loose in their saddles, gave response
with a waggle of two fingers to the salutes of the white men. A
squaw rode slowly by on a deliberate piebald that had no doubt
been as it were the nursery horse of many children. She smiled.
Looking after her they saw a cradle hanging on her back, a small
face there, eyes staring out at the receding landscape.</p>

<p>Anon came Red Shield, a fine figure, sitting erect,
foursquare. He not only was a chief--he looked a chief in his
fringed buckskins, and with his plaited hair (the <i>braids</i>),
bound at the ends with little brass rings. He halted to talk to
Buchanan, and as he did so the horses of those behind behaved as
usual when one stopped ahead--immediately took the opportunity to
turn aside and snatch at the special herbage of their fancy.</p>

<p>There was the girl of Angus's admiration and
considerations--swinging out her rein-hand to ride past Buchanan
and Red Shield.</p>

<p>"Your horse wants to stop and eat," Angus said.</p>

<p>"Yes," and she showed white teeth in a smile.</p>

<p>That was all. He wondered if that was all she knew of
white-man speech, <i>yes</i> and <i>no.</i></p>

<p>"Your people seem to have got plenty deer for moccasins," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes--and the skins are very good this year," she replied.</p>

<p>The clarity of her voice, the precision of her utterance, made
him glad he had not spoken to her with the usual sort of
pidgin-English.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Minota," said she. "My father is Chief Red Shield," and she
inclined her head toward him.</p>

<p>"Oh, your father is Chief Red Shield. I have seen him once or
twice at the Mountain House."</p>

<p>He was suddenly aware of a young man manoeuvring a half-broken
horse past them. It seemed to him that there was anger on the
rider's face. He stepped aside to give more room, said "How-do,"
but the Indian was surly.</p>

<p>"He does not speak English," explained Minota.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn it?" Angus inquired.</p>

<p>"My father taughted me," she answered, and then in her eyes
was shadow of a doubt of her pronunciation.</p>

<p>To him it was well enough. Red Shield, he had been told, was
one of the ablest chiefs of the Crees thereaway.</p>

<p>The old lady who had observed their exchange of smiles the day
before was upon them then. Minota flicked the rein ends over her
horse's haunch and it moved on.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Angus to the old lady.</p>

<p>"How--do--you--do?" she responded, stately.</p>

<p>"I hope we will meet again," Angus said, turning to
Minota.</p>

<p>"I expect so," she said.</p>

<p>The chief shook his lines and the cavalcade passed, leaving an
odour of new-tramped, new-crushed pine, fir and tamarack needles,
an odour of horse-flesh.</p>

<p>"A fine old fellow that," said Buchanan.</p>

<p>"And Angus is thinking <i>a fine young lass</i>," said Tom
Renwick, sitting on his heels by the fire. "Eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Not bad," admitted Angus.</p>

<p><i>I expect so:</i> what, precisely, did she mean by that? Had
she seen in his eyes what Tom Renwick had evidently seen? Did she
mean only that wide though the land through which they roamed
they would no doubt forgather again? He was surely in love to be
probing for deep implications in casual remarks.</p>

<p>They did meet again, at the Port, several times before the
snow fell, and on each meeting the deeper was Angus enamoured of
his copper-coloured maid with the dark, lustrous, candid and
somehow pathetic eyes.</p>

<p>A letter from Ian Fraser, received just the day before one of
these visits of the Indians, for some reason--he could not tell
how or why--had the effect of restraining him, though but
temporarily. He was back, in memory, with that happy family, saw
the plates in their racks round the kitchen that was like an old
Scots interior, heard again Ian at his work singing in his fine
natural voice the old ballads; <i>hearkened</i> Fiona her
lessons--and her psalm!--and was doubtful if he should act as he
was here moved to. He had seen enough of Minota to believe that
all he had to do was to ask her, and she would be his woman. He
turned about and about on his finger the ring that had been his
mother's, the hair of his grandmother in its collet, and asked
himself (asked, almost it seemed, the ghosts of his people) if he
was wise.</p>

<p>He did indeed believe that, by an Indian's view, by an
Indian's ways of courtship, he had gone far already. He had seen
the young men at the preliminaries of their courting, which was
but making eyes at the girl of their choice till she either too
often turned her back with a finality of disdain or indifference
and it was realized as hopeless to proceed, or raised her eyelids
in passing and smiled, when the next step was to waylay her in
the dusk and cast a blanket round her. There they would stand,
these young lovers, by the hour, no one paying any heed, not even
the wild striplings of the village.</p>

<p>Yes, in all the meetings he had had with Minota her eyes
(after the first talk) had <i>told</i> him with a lovely
darkening or misting in them, like the darkening of pools of
water under a passing cloud. She gave herself to him in that
misting of her dark eyes.</p>

<p>The end of it all was that in the spring young Angus Munro
(just nineteen then) took his woman--it was never <i>my wife</i>;
<i>my woman</i> it was--to the factor, her father and mother with
them, to have an entry made of his union with Minota Red Shield
in the company's books.</p>

<p>He did not ask himself insistently why that was all, why he
did not go to the mission and have a white man's marriage. He
silenced the inquiry by telling himself that some white men took
their woman to wife without even the formality of an entry in the
books, no more formality than the present of a gun or a few
horses to the father.</p>

<p>What was the depth of his love? What was the depth of hers?
Her eyes had clouded when, her promise to be his woman given, he
had said that they had better have it written down at the Fort;
but she had not asked, instead, for a prayer-book ceremony.
Minota would have gone with him even without that. He offered
neither gun nor horses to old Red Shield. She did not want that;
her father, she said, did not want that. That savage, Chief Red
Shield, and his squaw looked upon it as an honour to have their
daughter wed to a white man. Minota's mother was a sonsy woman,
coming to the age when those of her race have a tendency to
broaden in a very definite "middle-age spread," a sonsy woman
with genial eyes and a happy laugh. She was a Stony (which is to
say an Assiniboine of the west, a Rocky Mountain Assiniboine)
whom Red Shield had met once at the House when both her tribe and
his were camped close-by there to trade.</p>

<p>No--no gun, no horse for the girl but, not as the purchase
price, merely as a gift--as the phrases went, <i>a prairie gift,
a gift cut off, a gift in itself,</i> meaning not given in hope
of any return or exchange--he presented Chief Red Shield (on the
sober advice of Captain Buchanan) with a silk hat, a secondhand
top hat, with a second-hand ostrich feather round it, for the
trade-room at Rocky Mountain House had a queer miscellaneous
stock of goods.</p>

<p>Within the palisades were two or three cabins from an earlier
period, uninhabited, and in one of these, new-caulked in chinks
between the logs, with a Franklin stove from the trade-room,
Angus took up house with Minota, making the third at that time in
the Fort with an Indian woman. He had moved, as it were, another
step away from Loch Brendan. This log cabin was not like those at
Red River, thatched, but had a roof of split cedar--<i>cedar
shakes.</i></p>

<p>Speedily his Cree talk improved. He discovered that there was
not only pidgin-English but pidgin-Cree, and that many white
people who imagined that they spoke Cree spoke only that. Minota
unfolded for him the tenses of the verbs, and he learnt how
pliant were the sentence formations, how full the vocabulary, and
that often with one word could be conveyed what necessitated the
use of half a dozen English to express. He came to respect <i>les
sauvages</i> more and more.</p>

<p>As she taught him her language his mind often went back to
Sabbath evenings in Scotland, Sabbath evenings at Red River, and
the voice of his father (or of Fraser) would be with him again,
reading in the Scriptures. For to the same simple, elemental,
eternal things did the Crees go for imagery as the Hebrews.
<i>The winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers
appear on the earth, the time of the singing birds is come and
the voice of the turtle is heard in the land,</i> might have been
one of Minota's songs. <i>Like as a hen gathering her chickens
under her wings</i> was pure Cree, it struck him. When she taught
him the sign language even more did he recall the voice of his
father rolling out the Hebraic metaphor in the candlelight at
Brendan. If one would signify in the sign language <i>I am
happy,</i> so Minota showed him, one made the signs for
<i>day</i> and <i>my heart,</i> meaning: <i>The day is in my
heart.</i> There seemed to be no giving of orders in the talk of
the hands. There was no <i>Do that,</i> no <i>Do not do that.</i>
Instead there was <i>I think it good for you to do that,</i> or
<i>I think it not good to do that.</i></p>

<p>The names of the months, the moons, she told him, beginning
with the moon before winter; the moon when the leaves fall: the
moon when deer rut; the moon when deer shed their horns; the moon
that is hard to bear; the moon when the buffalo cow's foetus is
large; the moon of sore eyes (because of the sunlit snow then);
the moon when the geese lay eggs; the moon of growing grass; the
moon when strawberries ripen; the moon when the buffalo bulls are
fat; the moon when the buffalo cows are in season; the moon of
red plums. She showed him games, gambling games with little pegs,
peeled wands: and one that was simply cup-and-ball Indian
fashion.</p>

<p>Well though she could speak English she could read neither
print nor script, nor did she know the Cree syllabics devised at
Norway House by the Methodist missionary there, James Evans, for
her people. Pictograph she could have translated, with the
symbolic colourings among the figures represented, but not these
symbols. The Woods Crees speedily learnt them but the Plains
Crees, roving about in bands, buffalo hunters chiefly, had not
the same need to leave missives behind as those who split up into
small parties and families for their hunting and trapping in the
Land of Little Sticks. The day was to come when Angus would
regret that he had not taught her to write.</p>

<p>Like most white men he had looked upon <i>savages</i> as
signifying something ceaselessly vindictive and treacherous. Red
River had corrected that. Like most white men he had looked upon
the religion of his people as the only true faith--and discarded
that view while living with Minota. Very tenderly he came to
think of her as she lost her shyness before him and revealed what
lived behind these dark, deer-like eyes, behind that soft-moving
and graceful exterior. She reminded him at times, by reason of
her innocence, her na&iuml;vet&eacute;, of his mother, and
occasionally, with her heresies, of his father. She could not
understand, for example, simple though it is to the civilized
mind, how the company that sold firearms to the Crees was the
same that sold firearms to the Blackfeet, Blackfeet and Cree
being hereditary enemies. The shareholders in armament firms that
gaily, in our days, manufacture lethal weapons for any who will
buy she could not have understood.</p>

<p>There were moments when, in place of feeling that he had
condescended, or descended, in this alliance, he felt that he was
in the presence of something far superior. She was credulous,
pathetically so, he thought often, but that credulity, he
realized, was from her honesty and truthfulness. She told him of
the Blackrobe that came to the Piegans southward with what was
called the seventh day ceremonials.</p>

<p>"And one day," said she, "a Piegan went out to hunt, and the
Blackrobe saw him going and called to him that it was the Rest
Day. The Indian laughed at him and--" her eyes were solemn as she
continued, "he was killed that day by a grizzly bear. So the
Blackrobe stood up before all the people and told them that God
had sent the bear to punish that man, and the next time he rang
his bell and called that it was the Day of Rest he had a great
gathering in his lodge for the ceremonial. Do you think," she
ended, "that God would send a grizzly to kill the man for not
resting on His Day?"</p>

<p>Angus shook his head slowly, saying nothing.</p>

<p>"After that Blackrobe left them he went through the Flathead
country and there he baptized a great many, all under the water
in a river. And after he had baptized them they went on a war
party against the Crows and got many horses, without any being
killed. The Blackfeet heard of it and waited for him to come back
and got him to baptize a lot of them, and then they went out
horse-stealing into the Gros Ventre country, and it was the most
successful raid they had had for many snows."</p>

<p>She looked into his eyes.</p>

<p>"You think there is nothing in it?" she asked, trying to read
his thoughts.</p>

<p>He was in a quandary similar to that of parents who have had
formal religious upbringing and wonder, grown to years of
questioning, whether they should bring their children up to a
belief in all the old stories or not. She pressed the point.</p>

<p>"You think there is nothing in it?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said.</p>

<p>It was clear to her he would not say any more than that. Of
her own people's medicine men she had been rendered somewhat
skeptical. They demanded much when they came to shake their
rattles, beat their drums, blow their whistles and sing over sick
people. She thought that many men and women could do more for
illness with herbs and certain roots made into plaisters. Not but
what she herself knew of a medicine-man who did a wonderful
thing. He cut with a flint a crack in the side of an ailing
woman, sucked some of the bad blood there, spat it forth, and lo,
he had sucked a little frog from her inside.</p>

<p>"Did she recover?" Angus asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, she recovered at once, and her man gave the medicine-man
ten ponies, for he was very fond of her."</p>

<p>She told him the medicine-men were paid chiefly with ponies
and buffalo robes. But when anyone was dead their powers ended.
The good Father Lacombe at Fort Edmonton had power even after men
died. That beautiful black horse he rode he had received from a
widow for getting the soul of her dead husband out of
purgatory.</p>

<p>"All round us is mystery," said Minota.</p>

<p>Angus nodded slowly, listening.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"We have the same belief," she said.</p>

<p>There came to Rocky Mountain House news of the Sepoy Mutiny.
What was it all about? they wondered. The first emotion was, no
doubt, that whatever its cause, enemies of Britain, and rebels,
must take their punishment. But soon there was sympathy at the
Fort with the mutineers when they heard more. Living among a
people prone to superstitions and respecting these if for no
other reason than that the amenities might continue and Trade go
well, the general view was that British arrogance had made a mess
among the Sepoys. Angus, after hearing the talk, explained to
Minota thus: Much as in the way that the Crees will eat dog, a
dish that is abhorrent to the Blackfeet, it was <i>bad
medicine</i> to some of the people away off there to touch pig
and to others the cow was sacred. A new sort of rifle was issued
to these people, the cartridges of which needed to be greased,
and they had found out that the grease used was that of pig and
cow. They objected, and their objection was unheeded--hence the
Indian Mutiny.</p>

<p>"Could they not have let beaver fat, or some other fat, be
used?" asked Minota. "That would have put the matter well."</p>

<p>"They would never think of that," replied Angus, deep in him a
hatred of tyranny, of the arrogant.</p>

<p>He would talk to her of his early home on Loch Brendan, of how
his people had been driven first from fruitful soil to barren
soil by the salt-water edge, and then harried even from that. Her
eyes had fear in them.</p>

<p>"There are some of my people," said she, "who think that the
day will come when we will be treated that way by yours, but I
cannot think so. I think there are many more good than bad white
people, enough good to keep the bad from doing that to us. I
think if they tried to my people would die fighting. Did your
people fight?"</p>

<p>"Not where I was. Our medicine-men said we were to go and that
if we offered resistance we would sizzle in hell."</p>

<p>"You do not believe in hell fire?"</p>

<p>"I--do--not!" he replied.</p>

<p>The year slipped past. There came the moon when the deer shed
their horns, December, and preparations were made for Christmas
Day (Big Sunday) with Oregon grape branches in place of holly.
The doings of Big Sunday somewhat puzzled the innocence and
directness of Angus's woman. According to an old usage of his
Highland home he set a lit candle in the window on Christmas eve,
and hearing the significance of that--a light for the dead to
see--Minota took it much more seriously than he. All night she
was hushed, thinking of, as she called them, <i>the shadows</i>
seeing that signal--his father, his mother, his brother who had
been drowned in the big water. Angus had difficulty in explaining
to her that he was not sure if the shadows would really see. She
thought they would--and they left it at that.</p>

<p>At the Fort the Nativity was celebrated in the usual way.
<i>Braw claes</i> were worn as they had been worn on high-days
and days of celebration all across that land, from the Great
Lakes and from Hudson's Bay to the Pacific, from the beginnings
of the fur trade. A prospector from the mountains (there were
many such in the land, much gold having been found the year
before far west in the Cariboo Country, by white men who had
wandered all that way from California) drank so much rum that he
died of alcoholic poisoning next day. Minota was troubled over
that.</p>

<p>"Did they get drunk," she asked, "at the last feast before He
was nailed up on the cross?"</p>

<p>"I should hardly think so."</p>

<p>"My father once got drunk and spewed in the lodge and was very
much ashamed. I think Jesus Christ would not like His friends to
get drunk and be sick on their last feast together. It was a
cruel way to kill Him," she added. "That is a sad story."</p>

<p>The new year came and the new year slipped along. The moon of
the sore eyes was none too bad because of a warm wind (the
Chinook) which wiped the snow away. The moon when the geese lay
eggs came, geese and ducks honking over, driving their wedges
into the north: and Minota sang:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The ice has broken in the rivers,<br>
 The geese and the ducks fly over,<br>
 All day--and even at night."</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But with the spring she grew restless. Her people were moving
out of their winter camps, setting up sweat lodges by the river
sides and taking baths both wet and dry, as she explained--that
is to say, steaming themselves in the low brush cages (the sweat
lodges), with hot stones thrust in to them, and then either
cooling outside wrapped in blankets (a dry bath) or plunging into
the river afterwards (a wet bath).</p>

<p>The desire to move was agony to Minota. One morning she asked
Angus if he would object if she went on a visit to her people who
were going from the woods to the plains soon.</p>

<p>"Why, no," said he.</p>

<p>She was troubled lest he should think she loved them more than
she loved him, but after more parley and mutual assurances of
devotion, and assurance of understanding from him, she took off
her white woman's clothes, attired herself in the deerskin kirtle
and leggings, wrapped herself in a blanket, and prepared to go.
On the point of departure almost she remained. Her people, said
she, would come into the Fort some day, and she could see them
then. So it was his part to beg her to go and tell her he knew
how she felt. As he spoke she looked long in his eyes, loving and
troubled.</p>

<p>After she had gone, Tom Renwick must needs chaff him about his
woman.</p>

<p>"Well, your woman has gone back to the blanket!" he said.</p>

<p>Angus felt he had either to take that remark as friendly jest,
or to fell him. He wished that Tom's smile had been pleasanter as
he spoke, to make the acceptance of his speech as a joke more
easy.</p>

<p>"That's it," he answered, "that's it," and lightly laughed as
one does when humouring another with whom for this or that reason
he has to associate and would bide with amicably, though at heart
he would fain see far.</p>

<p>Minota came back within a month, after many sweat-baths,
smelling of sweet-grass which she carried in a little sack
hanging from a thin raw-hide string round her neck.</p>

<p>In the moon when the strawberries ripen there was a suggestion
by Buchanan that they might soon have finished all their work
there and have to go to Fort Edmonton; and then arrived at Rocky
Mountain House--Sam Douglas. He had been far beyond Edmonton into
the mountains by the Howse Pass and T&ecirc;te Jaune Cache Pass.
He had made thorough survey of the foothill country between the
ranges and Edmonton, wintering (for his first year) with Macaulay
at Jasper House and (for his second) with Colin Fraser at St.
Ann's. He was well content. There was coal "almost anywhere,"
said he. He was going back to <i>the Old Country</i> to "interest
capital," and had come to Rocky Mountain House because he had
been told there might be those there who could convoy him to Fort
Brenton on the Missouri River.</p>

<p>No! Impossible! Attempts had been made to open a transport
route that way--and failed. The Blackfeet to the south contested
the passage of all. Even in mid-summer when they would be out on
the plains none could risk that traverse. Angus could see, at
that, that Douglas was perturbed. He evidently had no desire to
cross the thousand miles to Fort Garry alone. The Crees were
friendly, but there was always the risk of coming on some
Blackfoot raiding party in their country. He smoothed a hand over
his head, meditating. Angus laughed, surmising Douglas's
cogitations.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "you have a fine, fair scalp-lock trophy there
to deck the lodge of a Blackfoot on the South Saskatchewan!"</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble," said Sam, "that and the loneliness.
I am not a man that can live alone. I've been alone enough of
late, since last we parted. I was alone in the mountains till I
heard voices there. Oh, man, man, I have heard the
water-kelpies--and no use to assure me it was but a boulder
rumbling down in the spate, or the freshets, as some of them say
here, or the rise and fall of a wind that made the creeks cry
loud and then hush. No, I canna thole the loneliness."</p>

<p>"When the voices of the dead are heard," explained Minota,
"those who have been to the Catholic Mission make this sign," and
she showed him. "The Methodist ones just pray without a sign. We
pray and make the sign of <i>I pity you</i> to them, like
this--or like this, <i>I bless you</i>."</p>

<p>The grace of her motions held Douglas's eye with admiration,
and then--</p>

<p>"Aye," said he. "Well, I think I would make all the
signs."</p>

<p>She agreed to that suggestion.</p>

<p>"The more signs the better," said she.</p>

<p>"Would you," began Sam, turning again to Angus, "think of
accompanying me across the plains? In fact, I was wondering if
you would come all the way with me, seeing the boat-building is
nearly finished. Since seeing the coal fires here I have been
thinking that evidence of a person living here would be of great
help. They might look upon me as a mere promoter, ye ken, but if
I had one of the men of the land wi' me--"</p>

<p>There came to Angus what, in Minota's absence with her people
that spring, had often come to him. He saw, he heard, he smelt
the old land. Often, while she had been away, he had looked at
the Rockies to west and seen a peak there like Ben Chattan that
stands over the head of Loch Brendan. The forests along the
slopes he had, by half shutting his eyes, turned into heather and
moors. At Douglas's suggestion he saw, in memory, the seaweed
fringe of Scotland undulating to the tides that pound in from the
Atlantic, in his reverie saw the silver reflection of the weaving
gulls in the dark waters of the loch. The wood smoke and coal
smoke odours of the Mountain House were changed to the smell of
smouldering peat.</p>

<p>"I would pay all expenses," said Douglas. "We could even
arrange something in the manner of a stipend. You have conned
your book"--(it was his father's phrase too,)--"and you could be
of great service secretarially, too, I have nae doot." He always
broadened his speech when he was engaged upon a special
pleading.</p>

<p>Angus turned to his woman.</p>

<p>"Minota," said he. "It is as you felt in the spring when you
had to go and see your people."</p>

<p>"I know it," she replied.</p>

<p>"If I went, what would you do till I came back?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>She did not answer at once and Sam, with a manner as of
stealth, clearing his throat, stepped to the door, looked out,
the girl's dark eyes gazing after him--reproachfully, it
seemed.</p>

<p>"I could arrange for you to have everything here you would
want while I was away," said Angus.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No. It would be easier with my people. Here--" she
hesitated.</p>

<p>Douglas went strolling out, his hands clasped behind his
back.</p>

<p>"Some of the white men while you were away," she began, then
hesitated again. "I could wear a protection string," she said,
"though with my people I think my conduct would be enough; no one
would ever learn that I wore one. With the white men--some of
them--especially on Big Sunday, or at the new year, well, they
would not then respect even a protection string. No, I would go
to my people until," she looked at him with doubt in her eyes, he
thought, "you come back."</p>

<p>Angus wondered if among her people would be some, like Tom
Renwick, who would jest at her that her white man would never
return. That look of doubt on her face hurt him. He had an
inspiration how to wipe it away. On the impulse he withdrew the
collet-ring of his forebears and, taking her hand in his, put it
on her third finger. He had compromised between a Blackrobe
ceremony and the less ritualistic Indian ceremony of
marriage--which was none at all, unless the delivery of a string
of horses at the father's door be called ceremony. He had only
had the union entered in the Company's books. If she had desired
more, now did he abruptly atone.</p>

<p>She was surely his by the light in her eyes then. Had he never
before realized how deep was her devotion--her fealty--he knew it
at that moment.</p>

<p>"I will wait for you." she said, "till you come back from the
country of your people. I will wait for you--with my people."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c06">CHAPTER SIX</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>Kildonan Bell</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>So there he was, a mere satellite for the time being, it
seemed, of Sam Douglas, that young man of far-seeing plans, aware
of little but the misery of farewells and that it was too late to
change his mind.</p>

<p>The horses (it had pleased Sam to hear, while Angus was busy
on the packing, that they could be sold at Red River with profit)
stepped out briskly. Soon, as the ocean encompasses a ship, land
dropping astern, the rolling country received them and that
Backbone of the World, the Rockies, was dwindling down the sky to
west. Their route was to be southeast, toward the great plain
across which, picking up the loom of the Eagle Hills like a
guiding pharos, they would pass on by the elbow of Battle River
to the old Fort Garry-Fort Edmonton cart-trail.</p>

<p>Like Lot's wife was Angus that first day out, constantly
slewing in the saddle, hand on his horse's haunch, to watch the
sinking of the mountains. These undulating belts, the colour of
smoke, along the foothills he had ridden through. He knew them
for what they were. Always in this land there was an impression,
whether on flat prairie, rolling foothills, or among the
mountains, of immensity. It was not due merely to the scope of
the immediate view, for in the forests were often narrow gulches
in which one could only see, between tree trunks, trees on the
further slope set precipitately and densely. Nor was it the
result of studying maps of the continent. The prairie wind
whispered of space and space again beyond where the blue crystal
cupola rested lightly on the horizon; and in the ranges there was
the consciousness, in every dell where a creek shouted under
debris of fallen trees and moss hung in tassels on the branches
of living ones, that there were a million such dells, scented so
of cedar or of balsam, on and on, terrain of the deer, the bear,
the beaver.</p>

<p>Angus recalled, when they came to the headwaters of Red Deer
River, queer legends that Minota had to tell. Away down there
near where Red Deer River flows into the South Saskatchewan, she
had said, there were strange stone animals of enormous size, huge
lizards of rock that were sometimes partially exposed after a
gale that sifted the sand from them, or a cut-bank crumbled. Odd
the inventions of <i>les sauvages</i>, he had thought--and would
remember those stories of hers on a day to come, hearing of the
discoveries of geologists there. At the time, memory of her talks
about those queer creatures merely added, to the sense of
spaciousness, that of mystery, as they rode on, drawing near to
the swerve of land called High Butte.</p>

<p>They had been advised at the Mountain House to swing to the
north of the butte, coasting round its base, but Angus sent the
pack-horse up athwart its southern slope, looking back as he
followed them to see the Rockies bobbing upward again. Near the
summit in the thin whistle of the wind he halted for some
moments.</p>

<p>Sam Douglas, no doubt, realized the cause of his companion's
meditative silence there.</p>

<p>"It's no place for a woman," Douglas suddenly declared. It was
a statement beyond question by his tone.</p>

<p>Angus was about to reply. "You mean a white woman?" but that
would have been foolish. Obviously that was what was meant by
Douglas, who then plunged into a rambling dissertation on the
life of the forts where he had been, and of the settlements in
their neighbourhood. There was no law, or if there were law there
was no one to enforce it. Up at Edmonton murderers had been
pointed out to him, murderers free and unconcerned said he. There
was a Cree there, for example, who had slain two Sarcees that had
been visiting his family. They had fallen in love with his
daughter--"Or his sister, was it?" rumbled Sam. "Anyhow, the
fellow's name was Tahakooch, and when these Sarcees prepared to
leave he went out on the trail with them, dropped behind, shot
them both, and came back to brag of it, swagger of it before
whites as well as before Indians."</p>

<p>Then there was a raid he had heard of in which a band of one
tribe of Indians had killed one entire band of another, men,
women, and children, except one or two young women whom they had
carried off. And the prospectors who were washing for gold dust
on the Saskatchewan headwaters, and even over by the Peace River,
when they came in--"Well, some of them," said he, and paused. "I
like a dram whiles. I can tak' a dram. But drinking! Hech, sirs!
I've seen drinking now. No, no place for a woman--" he paused
again, "yet," he added, "but twenty years to come--you mark my
words."</p>

<p>"Uh-hu," said Angus, and turned his back on the scene for
which he had deflected the horses upward there. With lowered
heads the string went dropping down the eastern slope of High
Butte.</p>

<p>They passed on into that sea of grass in which for days on
end, in a phrase of the plainsmen, they were <i>out of sight of
land<b>,</b></i> no lone butte even raising far off a purple knob
in the immensity. Angus had a mental image: a great hand was
dropped in water and made a wide gesture in air, flicking down
the drops of Fort Ellice, Fort Pelly, Touchwood Hills Post, Fort
Carlton, Fort Pitt, Fort Edmonton, with three sprayed residual
drops at the end, of St. Ann's, Jasper, and the Mountain
House--in a sweep across a thousand miles.</p>

<p>There were days when they saw--as far as eye could
reach--humped dots moving slowly by the hundred all in the one
direction, and they even rode through these herds of buffalo
without creating a stampede. There were days when they travelled,
with a flirt-flirt and frou-frou of saddle leather, between
western sky and eastern sky and at night looked not only up but
forth at the stars as do sailors at sea. Once or twice they came
upon parties of the buffalo-runners from Red River and
Qu'Appelle, Scots and French half-breeds. Once or twice they came
to camps of Cree Indians upon their summer hunt, the tents all
set up like white candle extinguishers in the long wrinkle of
some coulee, the horses grazing round about--bays and buckskins
(with or without the prized black streak down the spine), blue
horses (the kind called smokies), pintos (skewbald and piebald),
horses glossy black and horses silver gray. Or they met bands on
trek, travelling villages jogging along with trailing
<i>travois</i> raising the dust. These encounters were the chief
interest of the traverse for Angus.</p>

<p>For Sam Douglas the most interesting episode had to do not
with any met or overtaken on the way, but with a cloud. No bigger
than a man's hand it seemed at first, sailing serene, how near or
how far hard to compute, ahead of them one blazing day.</p>

<p>"An odd cloud that," he remarked, "different from the
others."</p>

<p>A long gaggle of geese served to show that it was far off for
these distant pin-points in none of their divagations disappeared
into that cloud. What they were about it was difficult to
conjecture. They appeared to be but exercising their wings above
that segment of the world. Now they showed as an immense arrow,
moving definitely to north, then suddenly they changed to a mere
thread wavering irresponsibly in the ether. They were not
travelling anywhere, had either risen in alarm or but for the
pleasure of flight. The thread undulated in another direction,
was again arrow-shaped; and always, beyond, was that cloud, the
hue of which differed from that of others adrift and, by reason
of the difference, seemed ominous.</p>

<p>It dipped to the prairie's edge and there it broke in a
glittering descent, a thousand flashing points of light. They
talked about it in their camp that night; and in their camp next
day they talked again of it, having come to an area of the plain
where the grass was beaten into the earth. Arrived at Fort
Ellice, chatting of their experiences with the factor, Mackay,
and Chantelaine of Fort Pitt (who was there for a night on his
way back after a visit to Fort Garry), Douglas spoke of that
region of bruised and beaten land.</p>

<p>"That was hail," said Mackay.</p>

<p>"There must have been a midsummer hail-cloud emptying itself
there," said Chantelaine.</p>

<p>Douglas turned to Angus.</p>

<p>"That was yon cloud!" said he solemnly.</p>

<p>He had many questions to ask regarding these hailstorms on
blazing August days.</p>

<p>"I have heard of the stones," said Chantelaine, "as big as
marbles, even as big as bantams' eggs."</p>

<p>"It would hurt to get a crack on the head with one!" observed
Douglas. "Do they happen often?"</p>

<p>Not often, he was told, and both men were of opinion that only
certain districts were thus afflicted.</p>

<p>"Lots of people in the country for years have never seen one,"
said Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good hearing," declared Sam. "I suppose the
buffaloes' shaggy foreparts protect them if they don't know the
weather signs and clear away. But their hindquarters are not so
well covered. I should think ordinary cattle--"</p>

<p>"They don't last long," said Mackay. "It is just a cloudburst
of hail and over."</p>

<p>"But look what one storm can do in the time! Suppose hail came
down like that in a wheat-field--"</p>

<p>"There are no wheat-fields here," said Chantelaine.</p>

<p>The subject was in Sam's mind next day as they rode on by
Snake Creek toward Bird Tail Creek.</p>

<p>"Hail insurance," he suddenly boomed.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Angus. "What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking that some day all these plains will be
what they call <i>smiling farms!</i> Look at how the land has
been manured through ages by the buffalo. Look at the grand,
growing soil, man. It's too good for cattle, I'm thinking, a
grand country like this. And when that day comes an insurance
against damage to crops by hail--the way they have marine
insurance and life insurance--would be a good thing. No doubt
lots of people would say they would take the risk without paying
insurance. These men back there said the midsummer storms are
localized and don't happen often. But a fright or two, here and
there, for one or another of the smiling farmers, would make them
listen to a man of a persuasive turn. Aye, that's far ahead,
however, but to be taken a brief of in the notebook so to
speak."</p>

<p>"You are jumping ahead again," remarked Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes, a jump or two--as always. But those days are not so far
off as some might imagine. I'm going to tell you something
between ourselves. Last year there was a man--by the name of
Hector--a civil engineer--away back there in the mountains
looking for a way through for a railway. And the winter before
there was another man, Palliser by name, who spent the whole
winter (and he must have his courage) with the Blackfeet Indians,
so that they could become friends and he could move about through
their country at his ease--and he was on the same job. All last
year he was at it, looking for a route for a railway."</p>

<p>"We heard rumours to that effect at the Mountain House," Angus
began, "but--"</p>

<p>"But! Oh, yes, there will be <i>but</i> upon <i>but</i> for
awhile, I have no doubt, but it's coming. You and me, Angus, if
we live, are going to see changes in these parts."</p>

<p>Leaving Ellice, they went by the valley of the Assiniboine
which flows into the Red River at Fort Garry, and so anon came to
that small settlement to which, two years before, Daniel Munro,
Kate and Angus had driven in the spring, the mud dragged up by
the wheels and plip-plopping behind as the horses squelched on
the way--passed near the settlement (the hoofs of their horses
leaving a pennant of dust that day), coasted the slough where the
unexpected gulls had been too much for Mrs. Munro. On the
traverse they had, as was easy enough, lost track of a day,
neither of them sure as they rode down the Assiniboine valley
whether here was Saturday or Sunday. When houses began to show
ahead, rectangular scrabblings on the low skyline, the sound of a
kirk bell came to them on a light wind out of the east.</p>

<p>"So it is the Sabbath Day," said Douglas. "I wish I had taken
a bet on't!"</p>

<p>Together they rode to the Fort to discover when the
<i>International</i> was to go up the river. Hearing that she was
not expected down for two days, Douglas remained there with the
officer in charge (to whom had been one of his letters of
introduction), while Angus started out upon the road for the
Frasers'.</p>

<p>It was growing dark by Red River, scents and sounds stronger
than the visible, but along the road day lingered as though the
dust held it. Lights were beginning to show in windows and stars
in the sky when he came to the old place. He had the impression
as of having been dreaming, lying out under a tree somewhere, or
in a haystack--a strange dream of broad prairies, of
boat-building by a distant river, of the singing of an Indian
girl in a cabin there--as a voice came out to him, Ian in the
porch tapping the beat with a stick:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A vine from Egypt thou hast brought,<br>
    Thy free love made it thine;<br>
 And drov'st out nations, proud and haut,<br>
    To plant this lovely vine.<br>
 "Thou didst prepare for it a place,<br>
    And root it deep and fast,<br>
 Then it began to grow apace,<br>
    And filled the land at last.<br>
 "With her green shade that cover'd all,<br>
    The hills were--"</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The singing and the tapping ceased as Mr. Fraser rose to meet
the tall shadowy form that advanced. A light from within shone on
Angus's face.</p>

<p>"Well, well, it's Angus Munro! Come and see who's here!"</p>

<p>There they all were again, Mrs. Fraser unchanged in the
pleasure of the meeting gathering him to her and kissing him as
though he were a son.</p>

<p>"How you young folks do grow!" exclaimed Angus, but twenty
himself. "Fiona, Fiona! If you go on like this they'll have to
train you to a bean-pole! Let me see, how old are you now?"</p>

<p>"Nine."</p>

<p>"Not too old for me to kiss?"</p>

<p>She leapt to him in her lithe, quick way, kissed him, then
linked her hands over one of his shoulders while Flora embraced
him and hung, and swung, to the other side.</p>

<p>They passed indoors to the remembered twinkle of the homemade
candles shining on the plates in their racks. At that Hector came
in.</p>

<p>"Here's Hector," said Mr. Fraser. "He's the foreman now!
That's what his mother calls him, whatever."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are shooting up. Let me see, it is just two
years since you've been gone."</p>

<p>"Just two years," replied Angus as they sat down--and
marvelled at how much had been in his life in that time, back
here at this little settlement that looked out on the curve of
western sky and the plains as the shore-side villages look out to
sea. He had been to the end of it and was back again.</p>

<p>His eyes rested on Fiona, blindly it seemed, as the thought
came to him how far away was Rocky Mountain House. Where, he
wondered, was Minota then, as the dusk which had deepened to
night here at Red River ran beyond Assiniboia, Saskatchewan--and
on.</p>

<p>"You must have a lot to tell us of where you've been and what
brings you back," said Mrs. Fraser.</p>

<p>One thing, he considered, he could not tell. There were unions
of white with red folk round them there to be sure. Even the
tallow of the candles lighting this scene came to them from the
half-breed buffalo hunters. And yet--he imagined himself talking
about Minota: a shadow would come in Mrs. Fraser's eyes and she
would turn to her husband while he, to hide his stare of regret
or unbelief, would look at the floor. There would be a silence
broken only by Ian's unconscious whistling, or hissing between
his teeth, of some ballad or psalm tune, in a way he had when
pondering something sad, calamitous, beyond mending.</p>

<p>Next day Angus took an opportunity to slip away alone to the
kirkyard of Kildonan to see the stone that (as he had arranged
before going west) had been set up for his father and mother--a
melancholy occasion. Standing there he felt again a deep
loneliness--and thought of Minota. Voices had a way of haunting
him, and hers was with him then, singing one of her short
repetitive chants, about the grass sprouting, the geese and the
ducks flying over--all day and even at night. There rose in
him--there rose in him--a wish that he had for wife one of his
own race. Little more than a month ago he had left her, loving
her, yet here came this thought surging up and angering him with
its shabby disloyalty.</p>

<p>"It seems he has something on his mind," Mrs. Fraser said to
her husband that night.</p>

<p>"He went out this afternoon to the kirk where his father and
mother lie," answered Ian.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" said she.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c07">CHAPTER SEVEN</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>In the Haar</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Had anyone told Angus Munro during that last winter at Rocky
Mountain House that in the next year he would be hearing the
carts rattle in the streets of Edinburgh, and seeing the room of
a Lothian Street lodging hazed with a penetrating night mist, he
would have known that the runes were being read awry!</p>

<p>First he had been in Glasgow, where Sam Douglas had
interviewed many wealthy bodies, bailies and merchants, toward
financing his confident coal-mining project, and at most of these
meetings Angus was present.</p>

<p>"We have been bitten already by that country," said one shrewd
Glaswegian, shaking his head, and began to talk of a transport
company that was to take emigrants into the Cariboo
gold-fields--a hollow fraud, he called it. "I came near to having
the ignominy of being upon the board of that company," he went
on, "but did not like the look of it. It had its map of the
western continent, with a line showing the route from Ottawa to
Minnesota and the Selkirk Settlements--Red River--and on across
these prairies o' yours to the Rocky Mountains, and through them
to some river flowing west."</p>

<p>He opened a drawer and searched in it.</p>

<p>"I thought I had their map," he said, "but I must have
destroyed it in disgust. Their stage-coaches, they proclaimed,
ran from the Red River to the mountains, and beyond that they had
boats. What was the end of it? Suits against the company by folks
who had found there was not a conveyance for them beyond Selkirk.
I've just heard an extraordinary story about one party that they
bamboozled and that didn't come back to take them to law." (Sam
seemed to be all attention). "At their own expense they went on
across the plains, through the mountains, and there had their own
boat--made it, mark you--and they had to do what's called
<i>portaging</i>: you'll both ken what that is, acquaint with
that speculative country. At one place between close banks they
decided that two might venture down with the boat lightened,
instead of dragging it over land, and the others <i>portage.</i>
Well, these got to the end of their carry and there was the boat,
smashed to bits. One of the two men that had dared to run down
was clinging to a rock, and him they rescued. The other was lost.
When they came to look through his things for his relatives'
address they found that he had his log-book entered up in full,
aye to the very end. The last entry was, <i>Arrived at the
ca&ntilde;on--and was drowned</i>."</p>

<p>The bailie's contempt for the humbugging company was forgotten
as he talked by reason of his interest in that strange story.</p>

<p>Sam Douglas was but half listening, despite his rapt air.
<i>Stage-coaches!</i> Why not? Why not stage-coaches across the
great plains? <i>The Sam Douglas Transport Company;</i> or <i>The
Great Northwest Express Company:</i> he tried over to himself
various names as he sat there and the bailie talked himself down
a side-turning to the end.</p>

<p>"Ah, weel," said Douglas, "let us get back to the
coal-developing project. There is nothing fraudulent in
that."</p>

<p>"I'm not saying there is," the other retorted, "but there is
plenty of time before we invest in it."</p>

<p>"I'm no' so sure," said Sam. "I think you'll be coming to me
sooner than you have the faintest thought, and wheedling me to
get you in on't. However, however, I'm no' here to plead. I'm
here to give you a chance to be in on a good thing. We'll no'
tak' up your time, seeing how you feel."</p>

<p>There were many incidents of that sort, weeks slipping by, and
no one jumping at the chance that Sam brought them. At the end of
three months Angus considered how many of Douglas's letters to
likely investors he had copied, and examination of the file he
kept was depressing. Here was many a cast and never a bite.</p>

<p>They had been back close on half a year when Sam went on a
visit to some relatives (like Angus, he had no near kin), and
Angus thought to take passage on <i>The Clansman</i> while he was
gone and revisit Loch Brendan, but, instead, stayed in their
lodgings writing to the Frasers, to all his friends at Mountain
House, and to Minota--her letter addressed care of the factor,
who would read it to her.</p>

<p>Sam came back from his rest with renewed eagerness and his
notebook full of names of "likely folk" in the capital. But after
another few months in Edinburgh, where Douglas had no better
luck, Angus began to feel as though imposing upon his good
friend's hopes. Yet, not himself unhopeful, remembering the coal
fires at the Mountain House, his faith revived on hearing that
several of those whom Sam sought to interest in his plans had
also heard that a railway route was being sought for out there.
"Oh, yes, we admit that!" they would say.</p>

<p>There is no place like Edinburgh for book-shops, and when left
to himself Angus spent much time in them, or turning over the
volumes in the <i>dips</i> at their doors, needing no
recollection of his father's advice to con his book. He had
learnt the love of reading. A whole year fled thus, with an
astounding celerity, Douglas and he back in Glasgow again with
two offers of splendid chances for those seeking sound
investment. One of these was for immediate not a postulated early
reaping: <i>The Great Northwest Express Company</i>--to be going
on with.</p>

<p>"These bodies have nae ambition beyond keeping their money in
the bank," said Sam at last. "It's a wonder they trust it there
and don't keep it in an auld sock under the bed! We'll try the
Sassenach. I have some introductions."</p>

<p>So to London they went together, and there the result of all
the appointments and conferences seemed depressing to Angus but
to Sam were <i>eminently satisfactory.</i></p>

<p>"We have them interested," he said "We have them interested.
They have not bitten at once--but they will bite, and with a
snap, just when something happens to convince them. Oh, man, if
these railway engineers could only submit reports of a route we'd
have them. They are taking an unco while out there. I believe
they are fishing when they should be surveying!"</p>

<p>The words were jocular but something in the tone made Angus
think that Sam was dissatisfied and so thinking he felt again
that he was living on another's dream. He began not to like his
position.</p>

<p>Here they were well into the second year of this hopeless
hopefulness. They returned to Edinburgh and Sam, sprucing himself
even more than usual, went off for the day on private
business.</p>

<p>All that week Angus could not get from his mind a wish that he
could hear from Minota, or from Captain Buchanan. Feeling the
lack of news from her it occurred to him that he had been home a
year and a half and had not written to Jessie Grant. After his
mother died he had written to her and had received a letter of
condolence couched in very friendly--old friendly--terms. After
his father's death he had written again, thinking guiltily that
it was only the sad events that drove him to letter-writing. Her
reply to that did not come for a long while, for it had to be
sent on to the Mountain House from Red River. In it she told him
of her mother's death, writing from a new address. Her
uncle--Cameron, the blacksmith--had moved from Glasgow to take
over a better business at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. That had
arrived after his union with Minota, and answering it, sending
his condolences, he had found himself (he had to admit it)
writing as one penning a duty. He felt far from Jessie and that
not only in space. <i>Your old friend</i> he had inscribed
himself. He should go and see her, seek out the house at
Lasswade.</p>

<p>He wished Sam would come back. He felt downcast. He had a
feeling that something grievous was about to befall. Nonsense! It
was the haar (that fog off the North Sea) creeping up over the
city, creeping even into rooms, that depressed him. And then Sam
returned.</p>

<p>"There's a letter for you," said he, heeling off a boot by the
side of their lodging fire. "I was at the bank today."</p>

<p>On leaving Rocky Mountain House it had been arranged that
letters to Angus should be forwarded in care of Sam's bankers,
and in his letters to his friends he had asked that the old
direction should be used--never knowing where they might be.</p>

<p>He opened the envelope, and--"You will be heartbroken to hear,
as I am grieved to communicate to you--"</p>

<p>These were the first words his gaze alighted on. His eyes
puckered to the sheet as he read, his face ashen gray, for that
letter told him that his Minota had, as she had intended, gone
back to her people the day he left, and that everyone of the band
was dead of the measles.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is, as you may know, a new malady to the race and they
have no resistance to it in their blood."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Sam, putting on his slippers, remained humped forward, staring
at his friend. Something was wrong. Angus sat back, then rose and
walked across the room as if for help, wheeled, marched back
again, stood stock still and re-read the letter.</p>

<p>"There is ill news," said Sam, more than perturbed.</p>

<p>Angus opened his mouth to speak and could not. He was stricken
dumb temporarily because on each attempt to speak tears instead
of words were about to come. He would not weep and could not
speak. He sat down again, just nodding his head to Sam.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c08">CHAPTER EIGHT</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>Ettrick Brothers</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Angus was twenty-two and had had the feeling, for long, of a
sort that many men do not experience till gray hairs come--a
feeling of having lived his life. At times, in fact, it was as
though he had known more than one life: an early one by the
shores of Loch Brendan, then, to the wailing notes, the slow
surge of a coronach, an end of that; another on the Red River and
an end to it with a voice halting him on a blurred road,
intermittently intoning, <i>Relief</i>: another in a west that
had, remembered in Lothian Street, the quality of dream lived
between the freedom, the spaciousness of an ocean of grass and
the grandeur of the ranges, a life he had ridden away from of his
own accord, though doubtfully and with many a backward look.</p>

<p>Again, recovered from the shock of the news of Minota's death
(though haunted by the thought that nowhere yonder by the
Saskatchewan she moved any longer), he began to think of his
position with Sam Douglas and to feel himself as--well, in an
excessive fashion he called himself <i>sponger</i>, though had he
called himself so to Sam there would have been ructions. Neither
to the Great Northwest Coal Company, nor to the Great Northwest
Express Company did any investors attach immediate importance.
There were no more appointments with <i>nibblers.</i> There were,
eventually, no more letters to copy. It seemed the end had come;
and one day when Sam went off again on private business, Angus
trudged into the country to think upon his position, for easier
could he deliberate under the sky than under a ceiling.</p>

<p>At Morningside the sight, suddenly, of the range of the
Pentlands recalled to his mind the westward view from the
Mountain House, immense though the difference. He was sick for
the upper waters of Saskatchewan, the upper ripplings of Red Deer
River. He tramped on, meditating, and when the pee-wees were
calling by Fairmilehead he came to a decision to begin--here, in
Edinburgh--a new life. Home again in Lothian Street he awaited
Sam's return and came to the matter straightway, the more minded
to do so because, for once, there was a look of depression on the
older man's face.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, Sam," said Angus.</p>

<p>"You have been thinking," said Sam, taking off his boots by
the fireside.</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't live off you any--"</p>

<p>"Bide a wee! Bide a wee!" Sam cried out, and raised a hand,
holding a slipper, which he waved. "We'll pull in our belts and
try again."</p>

<p>"No. I've been thinking and I have decided to make a fresh
start. I'd like to go into the bookselling business."</p>

<p>"The bookselling business! You that has--"</p>

<p>"I've done with the wandering life."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have! Well, yes, I see. I suppose--" Sam bent to put
on his slippers and said no more.</p>

<p>"Yes," Angus exploded.</p>

<p>"My own plans are awful unsettled," Sam confessed, "and if you
are really decided on that--"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Well, I can give you an introduction to the Ettricks. Nothing
like having wires to pull, nothing like having introductions. My
folks knew old Ettrick. He was better than the sons." He
stretched back in his chair. "To be quite candid, I don't know
what my own future will be. Ye ken, Angus--or I don't know if I
ever did mention it--I'm orphaned like yourself. I have nae
recollection of my mother and the dimmest of my father, and
sisters and brothers have I none. Whiles when I get a whiff of a
certain brand of tobacco I kind of see the old man less dim. I
presume he smoked it. Aye, aye. It was my guardian I went to see
the day. He was against me travelling, but when I turned
twenty-one I took the gate. He said to me, says he, the day, when
I went to see him, <i>A rolling stone gathers no moss.</i> Folk
that spit proverbs at ye give me a scunner. 'No, sir,' says I,
'but it can get a certain amount of polish,' and says I, 'Bide a
wee and yell see the moss.' He gave me a lecture on living on
capital and hope in a fool's paradise, and finished up wi' a
Latin tag, too--<i>rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis</i>, 'if
ye ken,' says he, 'what I mean.' Says I, 'Fine I ken, but I
prefer <i>Nil desperandum!</i>' Aye. The man is nevertheless
right that I am not, for the moment, forging ahead, or making
<i>hay while the sun shines</i>, or such like. Yes, I'll call and
see the Ettricks. No, I'll write to them to make an appointment
with you. The firm used to be Ettrick and Bruce; old Ettrick
retired, Bruce died, and the Ettrick sons, growing up, made it
difficult for the son of Bruce, and finally annoyed him out of
the business. I'll no' say they are estimable, but they have a
grand business. And, frankly, in life I have found it does not
matter whether folks are estimable or not so long as we get from
them what we want. Nor does it matter what names they cry us. Oh,
well, perhaps I speak too plainly at times. Fine fellows, fine
fellows--in their own way, no doubt. You'll get on with the
Ettrick brothers."</p>

<p>So a day or two later Angus coasted the castle rock's base and
mounted to the Ettrick Brothers' bookshop where William, the
elder, received him--no, not graciously, fawningly. Angus was
dubious of him at first sight: a man of middle stature with
tow-coloured hair, wearing spectacles through which he either
stared with eyes wide open or behind which, closing them, he
revealed white lids to obscure the evidence of his emotions from
those to whom he talked. When Ettrick cast back his head,
displaying the white lids in a pose that gave his nose a porcine
cast, Munro had the impulse to explain that since his friend Mr.
Douglas wrote his own plans had been changed. Perhaps, it would
have been better had he followed that impulse instead of telling
himself that he should not judge a man at first sight. What
Ettrick had to say, with all these accompanying facial changes,
did of itself, as the interview progressed, cause him to wonder
if here was his place.</p>

<p>"Do be seated, sir," William Ettrick turned and bellowed to
one of his staff: "You, bring a chair for this gentleman. And
what can I do for you? You are a friend of Sir Lovat Douglas's
son," which, by the way, was the first Angus had heard of a title
for Sam's father.</p>

<p>"I came back from the west with Mr. Douglas and I have been
thinking that I would greatly like to go into the bookselling
business here."</p>

<p>"Quite, quite," and the eyelids drooped. "You are considering
partnership?" The eyelids rose a little and William Ettrick
peeped sidelong at the young man.</p>

<p>"No, not just that," Angus replied.</p>

<p>Ettrick started, drew erect. Some thought passed in his mind
that set a sleek smile on his face.</p>

<p>"You might find the money later, perhaps?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"I doubt it. I really want to get work in a bookshop."</p>

<p>"Ow!" said William Ettrick. "Ow!" and he blinked rapidly. "I
must have misunderstood Mr. Douglas's letter. By the way it was
couched I had the impression you--well," he interrupted himself,
and the fawning manner that had been decreasing slipped clean off
him. "As a matter of fact, we could do with another
assistant."</p>

<p>He glanced at Angus, annoyed that he should, by reason of the
wording of Sam's letter, be sitting instead of standing.</p>

<p>"You want a stipend?" he asked.</p>

<p>Angus stared.</p>

<p>"You see, as a rule," explained Ettrick, "beginners learning
the business consider themselves lucky to be with us without the
boot being on the other foot and them paying for the tuition. I'm
afraid I could not offer much to start with. You see, it's
reading books that gives you the idea to go in for the business,
according to Mr. Douglas. You have no knowledge of the
commercial?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Are you living with relatives in the city?" William asked,
dropping his eyelids again and peeping from under them.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"It's plain enough, surely," said Ettrick. "If you are living
with relatives you would not need as much wages as if you were
living alone."</p>

<p>"Oh! No, at present I am staying with Mr. Douglas. He is not a
relative."</p>

<p>"Not a relative. Quite. Well, I'm busy now. I have given you a
lot of time. I'll talk it over with my brother and we'll write
you."</p>

<p>He raised his head, closed his eyes, and Angus realized that
he was expected to go.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "Good day."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Within the week there he was on next to nothing of a salary
with a promise of an increase after a year's trial, if all went
well--"which would be fair to both parties," said Mr. William
Ettrick. And hardly was he installed when Sam Douglas announced
that he was off to the west again, this time on behalf of a group
of business men, at their suggestion, to inquire into the
possibility of large scale hydraulic workings of the gold-fields
in the Cariboo, such as were being undertaken in California at
the locations of the old "Forty-niners."</p>

<p>"They had no fancy for either of my plans--neither the one I
came to them with nor the other that I evolved when I was
listening to yon loquacious body, you mind. But me being here
they have looked upon as a lucky chance for one of their own
notions."</p>

<p>"When do you go?"</p>

<p>"At once."</p>

<p>"So soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all fixed up. I go round the Horn this time to New
Westminster at the mouth of the Fraser River. Well, I do at least
see the world, which is not exactly the main matter, but it's
fine."</p>

<p>So next day Angus was alone.</p>

<p>It was not permissible for the staff at Ettricks' to take home
even second-hand books to read, but all did; and so, though
merely to be in the service of such men gave an effect as of
ignominy, they being what they were, that misery could be looked
upon as a secondary matter by an avid reader. Besides, there were
customers who atoned.</p>

<p>"We have <i>personages</i> come into our shoap," Angus one day
heard William tell another assistant, "and I would be glad if you
would have a more deferential manner. I notice you have a
tendency to be kind of jack-easy whiles with the customers."</p>

<p>One of these <i>personages</i>, to whom Angus took a great
liking, was John Hill Burton, the historian. For some reason Hill
Burton soon selected Munro always to attend to his wants and
would often talk long with him over some book he had bought,
leaning back against the shelves, the young man at attention
before him because of Ettrick's eyes prying and peeping to be
sure he was being deferential. No sooner had Hill Burton gone,
one day, than there was a bark from William.</p>

<p>"Munro!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" and Angus quick-stepped to the table at which the
senior partner sat towards the rear of the shop.</p>

<p>Ettrick opened his eyes wide, showing the whites all round the
pupils (no other way could he look directly at anyone), then
dropped his lids and elevated his chin.</p>

<p>"You are here to serve customers, not to collogue with them,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>There being no envy in Angus he did not suspect that here was,
perhaps, at least partly, foolish jealousy at work. Ettrick's
fawning advances Hill Burton had so often cut short that at last
William, on his entrance, pretended complete engrossment over
papers on his desk.</p>

<p>"I--beg--your--pardon?" said Angus.</p>

<p>"Well may you," replied Ettrick, addressing his pewter
inkwell. "I saw you cracking with Dr. Hill Burton--a
<i>distinguished personage.</i> You may drive folk from the
shoap."</p>

<p>"He wanted to talk. I could not tell him not to."</p>

<p>"He wanted to talk? How could a man with his brains want to
talk wi' the likes of you? You have, too, I notice, somewhat of a
Hieland manner as though it's less in your line to handle
quartos, let alone duodecimos, than to use a hoe."</p>

<p>"Or a claymore," suggested Angus.</p>

<p>"Eh?" snapped Ettrick, and looked up, his eyes blazing, but on
meeting Angus's gaze he shut close his lids and so, head back,
spoke to the air. "Remember you are a servant here and not the
equal of the customers. What were you talking about to Dr. Hill
Burton?"</p>

<p>"He was asking me about the Indians of the West. He had been
reading in a book of De Quincey's--whom he knew, he told me, when
De Quincey was still alive and living in Edinburgh--"</p>

<p>"Well, he'd have to be still alive for him to know him!
There's intelligence for you--and you go cracking wi' the
customers. Well?"</p>

<p>Angus cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"In this book," he said, speaking slowly, "De Quincey had
mentioned a volume by a Mr. Weld on life in Canada, and there was
a sentence he had quoted: <i>The sweet laughter of Indian
women.</i> Mr. Burton--"</p>

<p>"<i>Hill</i> Burton, Dr. Hill Burton."</p>

<p>"--remarked," went on Angus, "that he had often heard that the
North American Indian seldom laughs and wanted me to tell him if
that was so."</p>

<p>"Which means," said Ettrick, looking unnecessarily shrewd and
sly, as though proud of his simple acumen, "that you have already
in your cracks with him mentioned you were out there."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Be careful. You may collogue too much and drive customers
away. That's all."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Angus in indignation as he turned away.</p>

<p>William opened his eyes and stared at that retreating back
more directly than ever could he look in anybody's face,
pondering the tone of that <i>Thank you</i> and wondering if his
assistant was being impudent.</p>

<p>Angus was only receiving what all received. It was part of the
Ettrick policy to seek occasion for fault-finding. William kept a
little black book with alphabetical index in which he entered
against the names of the members of his staff all sins committed
by them, however venial. Let any dare to approach him with a
request for a promised increase of salary and out would come the
Black Book. That was its main object. He did not (unless
customers were in the shop) modulate his voice when playing the
Angel Gabriel behind his table, ominous Black Book in hand. That
very day Angus and the rest saw one of the assistants arrange his
tie, take a resolve, and advance to the desk. His voice was slow
and meek, as was fitting in a serf, but clearly, bitingly, after
a pause and the opening of the drawer in which the Wee Black Book
lurked, they heard William reply.</p>

<p>"I wonder at your impudence!" he exclaimed. "I see here that
to begin the year you arrived--I said nothing of it at the time,
let you off considering the season--with a bloated look on your
face. You had been drinking. Can you deny it?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, in my own time, you see--"</p>

<p>"Your own time? What do you mean by <i>your own time</i>? Can
you conduct yourself in your own time so that in my time--I don't
suppose you'll dispute that when you are in the shoap you are in
my time--you look like a boiled lobster before the customers! You
are a married man, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Huh! And I see here that you failed to attend a customer who
came in till he had to come to you and interrupt your reading in
a book, in my time, I hope you will admit. Oh, no, no,
ridiculous. My advice to you is to be careful. Instead of getting
a rise you might be out in the street without a character. You
understand me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Good. The best I can say is that I'll watch your conduct and
you can come to me in a matter of six months. We'll see
then."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>No; here was no place for Angus.</p>

<p>Back in his lodgings he felt he needed a cleansing from the
Ettrick establishment. He could not get it out of his mind:
William at his table rising to salaam to important patrons with a
depth of bow graduated according to their positions as
<i>personages</i>--and not even seeing his staff when chancing to
meet any of them on the street; and the younger brother, Robert,
showing his tow-head behind a tall desk, where he kept the
ledgers, bent over them, peeping under his brows at the
assistants. Sometimes he would turn his back, stare out of the
window, looking this way and that as though interested in the
weather. Angus, seeing him at that, had thought he must play
gowff and was hoping for a dry course; but soon he was informed
by the others that when Robert behaved so he was but watching
them in the window, using it as a mirror--as, indeed, he might
easily, a neighbouring house-wall being only a few feet away
there, helping to turn the pane to looking-glass. He was slighter
than William, with a high, narrow forehead that, when he frowned
to and fro in the shop, as at times he did, showed a ladder of
creases, often as revolting as the white lids of his brother.
Angus did not like the Ettricks.</p>

<p>Well, he would forget the Ettricks in a book. He had taken
home with him that day--it was a Saturday--a volume of De
Quincey, jogged to it by that talk with Hill Burton. And the book
in turn jogged him to a Sunday's visit, the historian having told
him that the "English opium-eater" had lived, while in Edinburgh,
in Lothian Street and, not only that, but that De Quincey stayed
for a time in a cottage at Lasswade.</p>

<p>Lasswade: that was where the Camerons lived. He would make his
Sunday outing to Lasswade, find that cottage, and see Jessie
Grant again. And damn the Ettrick Brothers and their Wee Black
Book!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c09">CHAPTER NINE</a></h1>

<br>


<h1>At Lasswade</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Tramping into Lasswade on the Sunday afternoon, Angus halted a
man upon the road to ask if he knew the De Quincey cottage,
thinking to see it first and then seek out the Camerons and
Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'm a stranger here," said that one; and the next one he
accosted with his inquiry replied: "De Quincey? No, there is no
man with a foreign-like name living in a house--"</p>

<p>"This man is dead. About four years ago he died, I believe. I
wanted to see the cottage where he stayed."</p>

<p>"Dead! Oh, I dinna ken the name. I've only been here twa-three
years masel'. Never heard of him." But Cameron he knew. "Och,
aye, <i>farrier</i> Cameron he likes to be called. Ye see the
harled wa' along the street, with the twa big doors?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's the smiddy, and it's just by that--the first hoose set
back a bit. Ye'll see it as soon as ye get by the smiddy."</p>

<p>Getting by the smiddy, there was the house. Coming from it
were blasts of some musical instrument in an odd fashion, with
notes sustained too long and then hurried ones as in atonement.
In the garden was Jessie Grant.</p>

<p>She was standing on the red-brick path that led to the front
door, looking at the flowers, looking first at the blue stonecrop
border to one side and then at the yellow on the other, and did
not so much as glance round at the sound of steps in the street.
When he halted she turned. Their eyes met and--</p>

<p>"Angus!" she cried out, running to greet him as he opened the
gate.</p>

<p>What turned the preliminaries from an embrace into a
hand-shaking there was no telling, whether the sudden cessation
of the blasts within, suggesting that someone might look out of
the window, or the possibility of Sunday peepers behind blinds in
the cottages across the way--or some other restraint, hesitancy,
as they found themselves face to face again.</p>

<p>"I knew you the moment I saw you," she said, "but you have
broadened and filled out. Come in, come in."</p>

<p>She led him into a little parlour that was for Sunday and
special use. There was her aunt, Mrs. Cameron, rising from a
harmonium, hurriedly removing an apron which she had on over her
best frock. Yes, yes, she had often heard of him, and here was a
real pleasure to meet him.</p>

<p>The smith was called in from the kitchen--or it may have been
from the rear garden--an enormous, deep-chested, huge-fisted man,
tusked with the military moustaches of that period and mossy with
half-whiskers. He crushed Angus's hand in his and seemed
satisfied with the crush in response, appraising the young man's
build sternly, tucking his chin back and with two flips sweeping
his tusks as from moustaches into moustache--one horizontal swirl
of thick fur over his mouth.</p>

<p>"Be seated, be seated!"</p>

<p>All sat down in the parlour with the harmonium, Cameron
obviously not at home there, diffidently balanced on the mere
edge of a chair. By an exchange of glances between him and his
wife it appeared that they had the impression that these two
young people had been sweethearts in their immature nonage, Mrs.
Cameron looking sentimental and Cameron roguish.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing here, Angus?" asked Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'm working--you'll be astonished to hear--in a bookshop in
Edinburgh, the Ettrick Brothers'."</p>

<p>"In Edinburgh? So you decided to come back to Scotland. How
long have you been there?"</p>

<p>"Let me see," he began. It felt to him a long period. "Just
three months," he said.</p>

<p>"And you thought to look us up," said Mrs. Cameron, "as soon
as you got settled."</p>

<p>"Eh? Er--yes."</p>

<p>"Did you get the job directly you arrived?" asked Jessie, and
he thought how like her it was, how she was still the same as of
old--to be interested so.</p>

<p>"No. I came back--how time flies!--over two years ago," he
answered.</p>

<p>Jessie stiffened in her chair. The glow on her face that had
made Cameron and his wife glance one to the other--she
sentimentally, he quizzically--ebbed.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said she, and in the oddest way turned her head and
stared at the carpet to one side of her, so remaining as though
suddenly smitten with wry-neck.</p>

<p>"Did you come to Edinburgh immediately?" inquired Mrs.
Cameron, who understood the meaning of her niece's
contortion.</p>

<p>"No," replied Angus.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron looked at Jessie and was glad she had asked the
question, seeing the girl, at his reply, recovering of the
wry-neck attitude.</p>

<p>"No," he repeated. "We were in Glasgow first. I came over as a
kind of secretary to a man who was trying to float a company for
opening up coal mines in the West."</p>

<p>"I see, and you had to stay with him in Glasgow all that
time," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Angus. "We were through to Edinburgh, and then
to London, and then back to Edinburgh again, the time slipping
along--"</p>

<p>"And too busy to look us up!" said she.</p>

<p>"I didn't seem to have a moment for anything, but copying
letters," said he, "and going with him to business appointments.
I thought of visiting Brendan once when he took a day or two off,
but I didn't."</p>

<p>"It's just as well," observed Cameron. "I hear there's not a
stone left standing there. The houses are all demolished."</p>

<p>Angus imagined that Jessie's manner then was due to thinking
of what had been done at Brendan, considering that it was no use
to weep or wail over it. Her head was turned from them, her gaze
was out of the window at the cottages across the road with the
geraniums on the sills, blank and a trifle hard. But he misread
her pose and misread her private thoughts. He did not notice the
tapping of one of her feet on the floor, and had he done so would
not have known it was by way of outlet for an annoyance she felt
that he had been more than two years in the land, and three
months at his work in Edinburgh since apparently resigning his
position with the man he had come over with, and was only
visiting them then! Sixteen (for they were of an age) they had
been at the eviction: now they were twenty-two. His last
letter--from that place called Rocky Mountain House--had been
different from the earlier ones. She could not have told
precisely in what way, but there it was, a difference, as of a
voice in it.</p>

<p>"Well," broke out Cameron, "I have sometimes wished I had gone
to the Canadas--or Canada, as I hear them cry it now--when I was
a lad instead of 'listing."</p>

<p>"You didn't like soldiering?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. You have never any privacy, of course. You're
always among others and yattering, yattering. There's always some
lad that knows everything has to get up and harangue. You have to
learn to sit in a crowd and hear nothing. In fact, I sometimes
think that has an effect toward bringing on deafness--training
yourself not to hear. But I liked the horses. I learnt my trade
in the army. You see, I liked the horses."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"And when I was feenished sojering I started up as a farrier
and fine I have gotten on. No <i>back to the Highlands</i> for
me. I set up first in Glasga. Aye, there's a lot of Hieland in
Glasgow. Yonder at the Broomielaw on the Saturday nicht the pipes
going and naething but the Gaelic round you--"</p>

<p>"You have been to the kirk today?" interrupted Mrs. Cameron.
"I suppose you went to service before you started oot?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Angus.</p>

<p>She looked crestfallen at that.</p>

<p>"He's none the worse o' that," declared her husband. "The
Reverend Hedges Greenfields is a fine preacher. Not but what
we've been to kirk. It's a habit I got into. Church-parade, ye
ken--State and Church! But they never preach from the text
<i>Thou shalt not kill</i> in the kirks the sojers march into.
They have maybe either a sense of humour somewhere or a sense of
some kind of faint probity."</p>

<p>"Oh, Walter, Walter!" wailed Mrs. Cameron. "Whiles ye speak
most dreadful and profane."</p>

<p>"That's not profane," he answered, but throwing back his head
he laughed. "Aye, we have church-parade every Sunday morning and
in the afternoon she aye sits doon at the kist-o'-whistles. Even
some kirks, in fact--havena them, will not have them on
principle, inventions of the devil." He rolled an eye at his
wife. "I sometimes wonder," he said slyly, "if the neighbours
think so. I'm jokin', I'm jokin'," hurriedly he added, noting her
sorrowful expression. "Aye, some congregations refuse to have
them. They have the Precentor as of auld."</p>

<p>Up he rose, strutted to the big chair and standing behind it
made a motion as of striking a tuning-fork, then in a deep voice
declaimed:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'They bored a hole through Simon's nose<br>
    And put a string through it . . .'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Sing!"</p>

<p>Alone he sang the words solemnly, his wife looking sad, Jessie
laughing. Again he declaimed:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'The higher that the ploom tree grows<br>
    The sweeter is the fru-it!'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>and warbled in falsetto:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'The higher that the ploom tree grows<br>
    The sweeter is the <i>fru</i>-it!'"</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>"This is blasphemy!" his wife exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Blasphemy?" said he. "The better the day the better the deed
and the song, the psalm, the hymn, and the chant."</p>

<p>"How often have I to tell you," she cried out, "that the
meaning of that is that the better the day is the better should
our deeds be?"</p>

<p>There is no doubt, thought Angus, he was being speedily
inducted into the home here, his mouth closed but a smile fixed
upon its edges. For Mrs. Cameron's sake he would not laugh out
loud; for Cameron's sake he would not look as though impervious
to his fun.</p>

<p>The farrier sat down.</p>

<p>"You will stay and have supper with us?" said Mrs.
Cameron.</p>

<p>Angus turned to Jessie as for a seconding of the invitation,
if only by a look. As he did so she reminded him, shockingly, of
William Ettrick. Her eyelids drooped; she looked at the carpet,
then out of the window. Her aunt was puzzled and in a fidgeting,
a fussing, a little sudden flurry, glanced toward her
husband.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he. "We'll break bread together."</p>

<p>"It's quite a walk back," began Angus, Jessie still intent
upon the cottages across the street. "It's a long walk and I have
to be up early in the morning."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have a dish of tea now," suggested Cameron. "On
the Sabbath we aye have a dish of tea. And we'll have some of
thae scones I smell burning."</p>

<p>Up rose his wife crying, "Oh, my! Oh, my!" and dashed from the
room.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a few minutes. There was a profound silence.
Angus was no deep student of character. He felt toward others
emotion of like or dislike, but never burrowed down for the
springs of an action, inquiring for every jot of impulse behind
deed or speech. He did not realize that Jessie was annoyed that
he had been over two years in Scotland and here was his first
visit. The man he had been with had gone away, she gathered, or
Angus had left him: and he had only come (so she mused) to call
on them because he was lonely. That added to her anger. She could
not, for pride's sake, as in complaint tell him she considered he
might have come to see them sooner. She could not say, as in
scorn: "Not till you were lonely did you remember us!" She sought
opportunity to show her disdain otherwise.</p>

<p>"How did you get on with the aborigines oot there?" Cameron
asked at last.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Are the damsels attractive?" and the ex-soldier flipped his
moustache.</p>

<p>"I liked them," Angus replied.</p>

<p>He was aware of the attention again of Jessie, her gaze
returned from the street outside.</p>

<p>"You liked them!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>So he liked the native people out there, did he? Very
good!</p>

<p>"I have been reading in the papers," she told him, "about a
massacre of white folk by Red Indians. I can't say I would find
much to admire in them. Men, women, and children they
killed--near to the number of a thousand."</p>

<p>"Eight hundred," he said, having also read of it. Cameron, who
had noted the vigour of Jessie's speech, noted a little pin-point
of glitter in her eyes, looked from her to Angus and arranged his
moustache.</p>

<p>"Just eight hundred, was it?" she said. "I suppose you think
that's no' so bad!"</p>

<p>"I can assure you," said Angus, "that when Indians do that
they have been goaded to it."</p>

<p>"You must think a lot of them to take up their defence for
killing bairns--weans, braining babies, so the papers say. You
canna <i>assure</i> me that they are a fine folk after that."</p>

<p>"They must have been goaded to it," he repeated. "And there
are many cases of white men killing Indians--men, women and
children. Do you know that in some parts bounties have been, and
still are, given for Indian scalps, just as if they were
poisonous snakes."</p>

<p>"These massacres in Minnesota," she declared, "make me
understand it."</p>

<p>She said so not out of her true nature but in pursuit of her
desire to punish him for having been so long in Scotland and
forgetful of her. But how could he take her speech save as
expression of her view? He was horrified.</p>

<p>"We white folk are none so grand," he said. "Are you aware
that in Tasmania the settlers had a drive against the natives
clear across the island, shooting them as they went, till they
had wiped them all out?"</p>

<p>"Tasmania!" she replied. "That is not Minnesota. Have you to
fly to Tasmania for defence of your friends?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, and was suddenly angry. He showed it, to
her gratification. "I have not to fly to Tasmania. I can stay
here, in Scotland. I'll tell you one thing, and that is that if
an Indian comes into your house and smokes a pipe with you, you
can let him sleep there at your ease. He'll not get up in the
night and slay you. I'll come back from Tasmania, or Minnesota,
nearer home. You may have heard of a massacre in Glencoe. And
those who planned it ate the salt, so to speak, and smoked the
pipe, so to speak, and then got up and massacred--"</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Cameron returned to the room, carrying the
<i>dish of tea</i>--the tea-pot, with its helmet-like cosy over
it.</p>

<p>"Bring in the scones, like a good lass," said she.</p>

<p>Up jumped Jessie to fetch the buttered scones; and as they
munched and drank a little smile of content was on her face as
she looked at Angus--he clearly showing, she thought, that she
had annoyed him.</p>

<p>Tea over, he decided it was time he went back.</p>

<p>"It's quite a walk," he said again.</p>

<p>All came to the door with him. As they stood there Jessie
suddenly beamed, showing a friendly smile to someone passing by.
They glanced in the direction of her wave and saw two young men
saluting her, walking as though very conscious of being in their
Sunday clothes. Mrs. Cameron gave her niece a puzzled stare,
evidently unaware that the girl was as friendly with these two as
her smile and wave might signify.</p>

<p>"Haste ye back, as the saying is!" It was Cameron who said
that, flinging up his tusks with one hand and crushing Angus's
right with the other.</p>

<p>"Yes--now you've found us out," remarked Mrs. Cameron.</p>

<p>Jessie said nothing, but as she took his hand she opened wide
her eyes--so wide that again he thought of William Ettrick--in a
rigid stare.</p>

<p>"It's fine to have seen you again," said he, and added,
"Jessie." Then, on the doorstep, he nearly apologized for having,
perhaps, answered her back as he ought not to have answered a
woman, in that matter of the massacre that she had mentioned.</p>

<p>"It is nice to have seen you again," she replied, "and I hope
you do well at the book-selling."</p>

<p>Striding away he had a feeling of disappointment,
disappointment over life in general. His mind went back to the
birchwood by the Grant cot in Brendan, and he recalled how
diffidently there, feeling a doubt, he had spoken: "If I make a
way for myself in the Canadas--" and how Jessie had interrupted
him, replying that she was sure of herself but not sure of
him.</p>

<p>"She was right then," he told the ridge of Pentlands.</p>

<p>They had met again--and they had quarrelled. Farrier Cameron
(something likeable about that man, thought Angus) had known that
their talk was truly in the nature of a quarrel by the way he
looked. Yes, and but for the entrance of Mrs. Cameron (something
likeable about her, thought he) with the teapot there was no
knowing to what burning height the argument might have blazed. He
could not forget, when he showed annoyance and his voice
hardened, Jessie's smile then, a veneer as of malice on her
face.</p>

<p>He breathed deeply of the evening air and marched on, the
pee-wees rising and crying as he passed, in a field that the dusk
was beginning to claim, beyond a fail-dyke. The silhouette of the
Pentlands showed for awhile to west, making him again think of
the Rockies five thousand miles away. And more of Rocky Mountain
House and Minota was he thinking than of that cottage at Lasswade
when, at a rise of the road near Liberton, he saw the lights of
Edinburgh sparkle before him.</p>

<p>He returned to his lodgings wishing he had not gone to
Lasswade--had deferred the visit.</p>

<p>"And I didn't see the De Quincey cottage!" he thought as he
was taking off his boots.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c10">CHAPTER TEN</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Impulse</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He did not haste him back to Lasswade. Impulse was lacking.
With one or two members of the Ettrick staff he made friends, but
was more often, in his own time during that period, in the
company of books. Every Sunday, rain or shine, he was afield,
generally with at least some nominal objective, standing stone or
Covenanter's grave, heard the music (specially melodious it
seemed to him) of Eddleston Water and the rustle of the trees at
Habbie's Howe, evading argument, being alone, as to which of the
two howes was the authentic one of the poet Ramsay's
laudation.</p>

<p>From a hatred of the Ettricks, that by its intensity had a
bitter effect upon himself, he passed to an easy contempt for
them. When the year of his trial (<i>trial</i>, he would
sometimes think, was indeed a fitting word) ended he dared to
remind William.</p>

<p>"I am aware," said Ettrick to the inkwell, "that you have been
in our service a year, but I am too thrang with other and more
important matters at the moment. You can approach me some other
time."</p>

<p>It was in the month of August, the year before, that Angus had
begun that service, or servitude. No holidays were given to
employees in their first year. Here, however, was his second
beginning, another August near an end. The question of increase
of salary being shelved--</p>

<p>"When would it be convenient for me to take my week of
holidays?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Holidays! You have to be here a year for that."</p>

<p>"I have been here a year," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are thinking of the calendar year," said Ettrick.
"Only in that sense are you into your second year. You have nae
title to a holiday till you are in the second twal' month of
service."</p>

<p>"I am into it now," said Angus.</p>

<p>"True enough, but you are not going to take holidays the
moment it begins. Here's August near an end. I can't have any of
the staff going away in September when the students and the
advocates are in and out any day. That's oot o' the question. In
the other matter--approach me later, should it slip my
memory."</p>

<p>Time passed and, restless in the back of his mind, Angus
realized that here he had no continuing city. Out of a mere
curiosity to discover how slippery Ettrick's memory he left the
matter of increase of stipend in abeyance, making no
<i>approach.</i> It will be amusing, thought he, when the
increase is granted, to have a little discussion on the equity of
making it retrospective--with arrears payable as from the
commencement of the second year.</p>

<p>It was just a year and six months to the day from his
beginning in that bookshop (and, "I'll give him till tomorrow,"
Angus decided, "and then again <i>approach</i>") when, passing
along Princes Street after lunch on his way back to the Ettrick
house he saw, progressing slow and stately in that stately
thoroughfare, three feathered Indians. Tall men enough they were,
made gigantic by reason of their war-bonnets. All the people on
the street meeting them moved to one side to give them way. Their
slow march added to the effect of grandeur. Their mouths were
tight shut, but Angus could see the twinkle in the eyes of
one--he who walked in centre--at the sensation they were
creating, though all pretended to be unaware of it, strolling
deliberately, with eyes looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>Before Angus knew what he was about he threw up a hand and
waved it left and right, signifying a question to follow: <i>Who
are you?</i> he signed. They halted, and the one in the middle
made the sign of <i>Ioways.</i></p>

<p>"When I see you the day comes into my heart," signed Angus.
"Nearly four snows back I came here from the prairies and the
mountains and my heart is heavy here."</p>

<p>Never surely did the polished windows of the Princes Street
shops reflect so exotic a picture: three Indians in full regalia
and a young white man "talking" together, talking with their
hands in wide, flowing gestures.</p>

<p>"You come with us and see pictures," signed one of them, and
as he raised his arm in the gesture for <i>come</i> a coup-stick
hanging from his wrist by its rawhide thong--which is after the
fashion of a sword-knot--swayed to and fro. Gamins gaped at
that.</p>

<p><i>What pictures?</i> wondered Angus, but as they wheeled he
fell in step with them. Away they went, the three magnificently
attired savages and the tall white man, looming along Princes
Street. They turned into Hanover Street, progressed up the
incline to George Street, and, as the view of the hills beyond
the Forth showed, one signed: "That looks good to me," perhaps in
a courteous suggestion that though prairies and mountains might
be far off this young man's heart need not be heavy.</p>

<p>"It looks good to me, but my eyes see the prairies when I meet
you," Angus replied.</p>

<p>The three eagle-like faces under the three eagle-feather
bonnets were turned to watch the signs, and as he ended they
laughed, friendly laughter. Had Hill Burton chanced to come along
then he would have had an answer to that question of his on the
day when he and Angus collogued too long for the peace of mind of
William Ettrick.</p>

<p><i>To see the pictures.</i> It was explained to Angus when
they came to a doorway, on either side of which were placards
upon tilted boards.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Never had there been a note in the Wee Black Book, against
Angus's name, of unpunctuality in attendance. But the Ettrick
establishment was as good as non-existent, though a clock in the
hall, as they entered it, struck two. That sound gave him no jog.
Upon the walls hung paintings of chiefs, of squaws, scenes of
Indian life--a buffalo-hunt in summer, a buffalo-hunt afoot on
snowshoes over a rolling plain of pale blue snow with indigo
shadows.</p>

<p>One of his companions made the sign for <i>Wait</i> and passed
into a sideroom, while those in the hall who had been viewing the
pictures were all nudging and whispering and keeking sidewise at
the two who remained with Angus. He had not long to wait. The
Indian returned with an elderly white man, clean-shaven, with
aquiline features, eyes at once sharp and kindly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir?" said he. "My name is George Catlin," and
he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"My name is Munro."</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Munro. I hear you talk the sign language," and
Mr. Catlin gave a little of it himself.</p>

<p>The three Ioways signed that they would go back to their
viewing of the big village and see Angus later.</p>

<p>There, in that anteroom, on the walls of which were
pen-and-ink and pencil drawings, these two sat talking of the
west, talking of Indians in their own land, and of visits to
Europe of a party of Ojibbeways from Canada that Mr. Catlin had
presented to the Queen and Prince Consort at Windsor, of these
Ioways from the United States who had just arrived at Leith after
going up to Dundee--</p>

<p>"Ioways on a coastal boat from Edinburgh to Dundee!" said
Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's odd to think of," agreed Catlin.</p>

<p>Next day, he said, they would be off for London again on the
way to Paris to visit Louis Philippe, who many years before had
visited many tribes from New York State to Louisiana. They talked
till the sightseeing trio came in at the door and Angus, thus
interrupted, bethought him of time.</p>

<p>"I should have been at work at two," said he.</p>

<p>He had been sitting with his back to the wall, and as he rose
a picture there delayed him. It was in pencil, or chalk, a
drawing of an Indian, very drunk, looking over his shoulder and
waving a whisky bottle. He wore an army coat, an officer's, with
epaulettes, and out of the tail-pocket of it protruded another
bottle of whisky. He was shown in a teetering pose with an inane
grin on his face. On his head, ludicrous, was a high plug hat.
Angus stared at it, thinking of old Red Shield and the gift he
had given him of the second-hand silk hat, surmounted by a
feather. He who in his own garb would appear splendid, in these
trappings was pathetic.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go," said Angus.</p>

<p>As he shook hands with the three Ioways each made that sound
which is usually reported as <i>Ugh</i>, but is as much or as
little like that as <i>Hein?</i> is like the crescendo of sound
at a sentence's end beloved by both German and French. Try to say
<i>Ha!</i> through the nose with the mouth shut and you have
it.</p>

<p>Catlin walked to the door with him through the hall.</p>

<p>"This has been a great pleasure," said Angus.</p>

<p>"Pleasure has been mine, too, I assure you," replied Catlin.
"It has been a great talk. I'll be back in New Jersey
again--where my home is--before long but our chat makes me feel I
would like to go out west once more. But some places that I went
to ten years ago in safety I could not risk visiting now. Broken
treaties, rascally traders, the bottle . . . Well!" He held out a
hairy-backed hand in farewell.</p>

<p>Smiling affably, at twenty-past three of the afternoon, Angus
entered the dignified premises of the Ettrick Brothers. There
were one or two customers in the shop at the time but William
could not await their departure. Catching Munro's eye he beckoned
to him.</p>

<p>"What makes you late?" he asked of the inkwell on the table.
"You are an hour and twenty-one minutes behind time."</p>

<p>"I was at an exhibition of pictures," said Angus.</p>

<p>William Ettrick was dumbfoundered.</p>

<p>"You--you went to an-an-an ex-hibition of pictures and left
others to do your work--you, that has been of the opinion you
deserved an increase of stipend! You went to an ex--" Abruptly
his expression changed as his attention was directed beyond
Angus. "You are wanted," said he.</p>

<p>Angus, turning, found John Hill Burton at his elbow. Ettrick
rose and bowed.</p>

<p>"I hope I am not interrupting business," said the historian.
"I just wanted to look in and tell you, in case you have not
heard of it, that there is a very interesting exhibition of
pictures, of great ethnological value I should say, whether of
high artistic merit or not, in the city just now."</p>

<p>"This," answered Ettrick on his assistant's behalf, "is very
amiable of you. I appreciate your condescension."</p>

<p>"Thank you, indeed," said Angus. "I have seen them--just
today. As a matter of fact, that was what Mr. Ettrick and I were
talking of. I was telling him about them."</p>

<p>Ettrick cleared his throat in a succession of rasping
sounds.</p>

<p>"Did they not make you remember your old life in that remote
west?" asked Hill Burton.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I was just on the point," said Angus, "of
explaining to Mr. Ettrick that so greatly did they do so that I
felt I must go back. I was, in fact, just on the point of giving
Mr. Ettrick my resignation."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! Impulse! Impulsive youth! Well, it is better perhaps
than canny youth. When the arteries harden, impulse is not
synonymous with action. I fancy that in history one could find
many a case of impulse well followed. And what is <i>impulse</i>,
what is <i>volition?</i> There's a subject I'm interested
in--philosophically. Did you ever consider <i>volition</i>, Mr.
Ettrick?"</p>

<p>"I am no student of philosophy. I am among books, but candidly
I have such a busy life that--" William Ettrick cleared his
throat again in a series of little rasps.</p>

<p>"Did you ever" (Burton turned to Angus) "do something of your
own volition without enjoyment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I can remember my father and mother leaving for
Canada of their own will and yet--"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that would be in the Clearances?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Quite. That's a kind of footnote to this inquiry."</p>

<p>"As for myself, then," said Angus, "I do remember well that
though I left the west of my own will--and that not at all as
making the best of a bad job--I did turn about and about, like
Lot's wife."</p>

<p>"Casting a longing, lingering look behind," observed Burton,
and might have continued pressing for data toward some
philosophic theory he was no doubt at that time perpending, but
Ettrick put him out, standing by with head a little askew, an
equivocal smile on his face and his eyes almost shut. "When do
you leave?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as it is convenient for Mr. Ettrick to let me
go."</p>

<p>"I shall miss you," said Burton. "I had better say good-by
lest youth and your impulse carry you off before I come in
again."</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly, William standing by and bowing,
bowing.</p>

<p>"Very condescending of you, sir," he murmured, "very
condescending, I assure you."</p>

<p>Away went Hill Burton out of the shop and out of the young
man's life, but always to be remembered so--top-hat on his head,
tapping with an old stick as he went, a little bowed with the
stoop of a scholar, out of the tail-pocket of his surtout coat
his kerchief hanging.</p>

<p>Angus watched him go and then, turning, found William Ettrick
levelling upon him a steady and considering scrutiny--promptly
veiled.</p>

<p>"You can go this night," said Ettrick to the planks at his
feet. He cast back his head, opened wide his eyes, and continued
to the ceiling, "So be it is understood that you go this night of
your own <i>volition</i> so that you'll not expect your stipend
to the month's end."</p>

<p>"I am volitioned to go tonight," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"Very good. I will tell Mr. Robert to give you your salary to
date."</p>

<p>Angus went round saying good-bye to the staff.</p>

<p>"Are you discharged?" asked one.</p>

<p>"No. I have resigned."</p>

<p>"Have you got a <i>character</i>?"</p>

<p>"Only my own," said Angus, "for better or worse--such as it
is."</p>

<p>He astonished Robert Ettrick, the salary to date having been
paid, by offering him his hand in adieu. The junior partner
looked at it a moment and then, as one compromised into a
deplorable declension, granted his moist palm flabbily to the
departing servant. Angus stepped to William's table.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "I am leaving now."</p>

<p>Up rose Ettrick, elevating his head.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said he. "I'm sorry to part with you. But you
ken your ain ken best, ye ken, as the saying goes. I think you
were getting along very well and shall have pleasure in telling
Mr. Douglas so, should I have the opportunity at any time."</p>

<p>He put hands on hips, balanced up and down on his toes as he
spoke. Then he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye to you," he said. "I wish you every success. If, at
any time, you should want a character I'll be most happy to
oblige."</p>

<p>It was Angus then who was dumbfoundered.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he responded. "Good-bye to you."</p>

<p>William walked halfway to the door with him and there turned
back with a gracious, dismissing sweep of his arm.</p>

<p>Angus walked along the street, a smile on his lips. He swung
on his way as though treading on air. He was free. The light on
the high chimney-pots of Edinburgh, gold-leaf of the sunset, was
exquisite to his eyes that evening. The impact of the sparrows'
excited chirpings against the walls of the courts was crisp and
pleasant. Bugles blowing up at the castle played a fanfare,
tossed out as it were a salute, to his liberation. He more than
smiled. He laughed to himself, unaware, as he went on, so that
passersby laughed, too--not as nitwits laugh at those who to them
seem nitwits but infected by his gait and gaiety, cause of which
they could not know.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he came to his lodgings there was a cloud of tobacco
smoke in the room and in the midst of it sat Sam Douglas, back
from the Cariboo country, awaiting his return.</p>

<p>With his wonted ebullience (when the surprise on the one hand,
and the fun of surprising on the other were over) Sam had
<i>great news</i> to relate.</p>

<p>"It's a grand world," said he, "and I've had a most
interesting time. Man--that country out there is going ahead, and
going to go ahead beyond present belief." He dug down in a pocket
for his tobacco pouch to recharge his pipe. "Oh, by the way," and
he pointed the stem of it at Angus, "do you know what I saw on
the west coast? I told myself I must mind to tell you that. I saw
some peaches--and ate them, too. 'Where do these come from?' says
I. 'Right here,' says the man I had them from. He told me about
them. 'Here's the kind of thing to interest Angus Munro,' thinks
I. It seems that boats coming round the Horn often stop for fresh
water at the island of Juan Fernandez off the coast of Chile.
There are peaches there, grand peaches, and they'd take some
baskets of them, too. Well, it's stones of these that began the
peach-growing by the Oregon River."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Angus--and had a private memory of other
luscious peaches.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say that. I've minded to tell you about them.
And now there's something else. Camels! Yes, camels to west of
these mountains you saw from the Mountain House."</p>

<p>"Camels!"</p>

<p>"I've seen them. You know that Cariboo country is dry and
sandy, and some man who had been away down in the southwest, on
the borders of Mexico, noticed that the American army was using
camels there, specially imported for packing across the deserts.
What does he do but import some to the Cariboo. They sent the
pack mules up there crazy. The trails of that country are whiles
narrow on the ca&ntilde;on's sides, and if the mules saw the
camels acoming at such places they even leaped over the
cliff--and the horses, too. The men with them sent a protest to
government, but nothing could be done by law for them. There was
no Act against using camels. They could, however, ask the
camel-folk to be good enough to consider the advisability of
discontinuing the use of the beasts. So they took them off the
road, just let them loose in the hills. They seem to stand the
winters not so bad. I wonder if the bears and the wolves turn a
somersault at sight of them."</p>

<p>"Camels--there!"</p>

<p>"I knew that would catch you, camels--yonder. I thought of you
often there. On the Fraser River I wondered how you were getting
on at the bookselling. Man, yon is a roily river pouring down the
silt and the gold. They have stern-wheel boats on it, the same as
the <i>International.</i> Captain Buchanan, your old friend, is
piloting one of them. He sent his best to you. They butt their
way up it with the safety-valve fastened down whiles to make
their way up the gurly riffles, with steam on away ahead of the
guarantee--and just laugh at the chance. They have the spunk to
do it."</p>

<p>"But what brings you back?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"The news, the news!"</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"Well, the Imperial Commission of Inquiry into a railway route
over the prairies, and through the mountains to the Pacific
coast, got a veto of the scheme from the engineers. But now the
Red River Settlement folk have sent a memorial to the government
here--last year they sent it--asking for another inquiry, so that
there can be a railway in British Territory from what we used to
call the Canadas to their settlement, to save all that kinking
through Minnesota and then down the river. You see what will
happen? It's coming. It will not stop at the Red River. All the
talk of Confederation points the same way. They'll get their
railway to Red River anyhow, to start with: and then there will
be towns to think of beyond. I once thought of the Great Plains
as pasture for cattle, with the buffalo being slaughtered the way
they are. Then I thought, seeing how the buffalo herds have
manured that soil for ages, and seeing the grass on it, of farms
there. Yon hailstorm in mid-August (ye mind?) gave me a jar, but
now I'm--"</p>

<p>"Three jumps ahead," said Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes. We ken each other gey weel! That's what I'm back for.
I've left two good men out there to carry on in the Cariboo and
I'm home to interest capital in the idea of commissioning some
man--myself!--to buy land where the townships will be marked
along that railway route. There will be a fortune in it--buying
the town lots and selling them."</p>

<p>Would Sam Douglas have hauled down the flag had someone gifted
with prevision told him then that his railway would not be across
the plains for over twenty years? The chances are that he would
not, would only have doubted the alleged gifts of that seer.</p>

<p>"And how," he inquired, having explained his presence, "goes
all at the bookselling?"</p>

<p>"I left the Ettricks--for good--tonight."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Did you not get on with them?"</p>

<p>"Quite well. We parted good friends. It was an impulse I
had."</p>

<p>"What are you planning to do?"</p>

<p>"Go back to the west."</p>

<p>Sam threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Captain Buchanan said you would."</p>

<br>
<h1>Escape</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The steamship <i>International</i> was thrashing her way down
Red River. Sam Douglas and Angus Munro leant against the rail
watching the diminutive rainbows fluttering behind in the spray
above the stern-wheel.</p>

<p>Sam had been unable to interest anyone in investment in
town-lot purchases. In the end he had lost his temper.</p>

<p>"I am not pleading with you," he announced. "I came to let you
in on a certainty. Don't come to me in a year or two and say I
didn't give you the chance."</p>

<p>They told him he was premature. As he had to return to the
Cariboo gold-fields--and intended to do so overland instead of
round the Horn--he had asked Angus to <i>bide a wee</i> while he
made these unrequited sallies, so that they could go west
together again. In those days of waiting <i>volition</i> had not
come to Angus to visit the Camerons and Jessie to say farewell to
them. A year and three months he had let slip since his first
visit without calling on them. He told himself--thinking it,
perhaps, a duty or a courtesy to go to Lasswade before
sailing--that they knew he was at the Ettricks', and that if
Jessie wished to see him she could have found him there. The
quality of his first visit, as he recalled it, made it his only
one.</p>

<p>The overland route Sam had decided upon because of having met,
in the Cariboo, a Dr. Cheadle and a Lord Milton who had travelled
that way--they who were to be spoken of in years to come as the
first Canadian tourists, the first to make that transit neither
for gold nor furs but just for fun. It was not an easy route. It
was, in fact, that one of which a Glasgow bailie, years before,
had spoken, the route of the haunting memorandum, <i>Arrived at
the ca&ntilde;on and was drowned.</i> But adventure did not
dissuade Douglas. So here were Angus and he on the
<i>International</i> that thrashed down Red River chased by the
little broken rainbows in the foam of the stern-wheel.</p>

<p>Suddenly Douglas spoke.</p>

<p>"I wish I had never seen this damned country!" he broke
out.</p>

<p>Angus stared.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked. "When you smelt balsam off the
Saint Lawrence you did not talk that way. All through the
Minnesota woods you've been more like one coming home than away
from home."</p>

<p>"That's just it," explained Sam. "I would like to live in my
own land, but I am becoming unfitted for it by reason of knowing
this one. I wish I had never seen the damned country because,
visit by visit, when I return to my own I realize more clearly
that I could never stay there. They are too conservative over
there. You offer them the chance of a lifetime and with never a
word of thanks they say, <i>We will give the matter our
consideration.</i> Consideration!"</p>

<p>He moved from the rail as he spoke and they returned to the
pacing of the deck that the sight of those pursuing foam bows had
stopped. They came to a halt again under the wheel-house, looking
ahead. The river might have been but a lake by its aspect and
straight before them its end. The steamer swerved and another
stretch was revealed. There was the sound, also, of the front
window of the pilot-house opening and the skipper leant out.</p>

<p>"Come up in the wheel-house, gentlemen," he called, "and see
the sunset from here."</p>

<p>Sam saluted him and they stepped to the door, beyond which was
the ladder to the pilot-house. Sam grabbed Angus's elbow.</p>

<p>"What was I telling you?" he murmured. "That's it! That's part
of the grip of this land on me--'Come up in the wheel-house.' I
wish I had never seen the damned place, for I can never feel
rightly happy again in my own."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed the captain as they entered, recognizing
Angus. "When was it you were a deck-hand with us? Let me
see--nine years ago, I should think."</p>

<p>"Close on that," said Angus.</p>

<p>"And I know your face, too," continued the captain, looking at
Sam.</p>

<p>"I came down with you eight years ago and went up with you
five years ago," replied Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, sit ye down," they were told.</p>

<p>They seated themselves on a form beside the companion-ladder
and got into talk of the years between with fragments of their
doings and fragments of the life of the river in that period, the
skipper to one side of the wheel on a high stool and to the other
a deck-hand, both smoking cheroots.</p>

<p>"Aye, it's a great country," Sam declared, rising and stepping
close to the window to look down at the water ahead. "It's grand
to be back."</p>

<p>At Fort Garry they landed, Douglas going to the factor there;
but Angus went on through the French half-breed settlement of
Winnipeg to Kildonan, by the lower fort--the "stone fort."</p>

<p>Fiona spied him first and dashed to meet him through the
golden haze of that afternoon, shouting back to those within,
"Come and see who's here!" She ended the run with a final leap
and flung an arm round his neck. She would be turned fourteen
then, full of youth. She wore a great straw hat of her brother's.
The brim of it came in contact with Angus's forehead and it
bounced off as he bent to kiss her. They stooped together to pick
it up, with a crash of colliding crowns.</p>

<p>"Did I hurt you?"</p>

<p>"No, it's all right. Well, yes, of course it hurt but it's of
no consequence. Oh, it's grand to see you again!"</p>

<p>It was, for Angus, grand to see them all. Flora was shooting
up, though not as tall as her sister. Hector was more than
hobbledehoy, a youth with roguish eyes. Close on a week Angus
stayed with them.</p>

<p>The place was always in a stir with their shouting one to
another, from house to byre, from stable to the fields. Everybody
was at work all day and all were happy. The Fair was held while
Munro was there, and Mrs. Fraser, who had promised to bake cakes
for it, appeared not to find that extra labour in the hot kitchen
too much for her.</p>

<p>A great day was Fair Day, with exhibition of produce, of bulls
and cows, of calves and pigs, with prize-givings and
sports--tossing the caber, putting the stone, sword dances to the
skirling pipes, Highland flings on the grass, and horse races to
which the Indians came in. Angus was watching them with Fiona to
one side and Flora to the other, holding an arm of each. Ian was
leading home his prize-winning plough-team. Hector was in the
horse race.</p>

<p>"Go on, Hector! Go on!"</p>

<p>Fiona and Flora were leaping up and down like jumping-jacks,
and as the dust swirl went by dashed away from Angus to crane
closer. There came a voice in his ear.</p>

<p>"As I told you," murmured Sam, "I wish I had never seen the
damned country. This--this, too--would haunt me there, but isn't
it hot?" and he mopped his brow, then returned to a little party
he had left to make that comment in passing--a party of the
Company's employees and ex-employees, many of these by that time
retired in the Selkirk Settlements, as they usually named the
region, among them one who had gone to the west on the first boat
John Jacob Astor sent there--Alexander Ross, his wife, an
Okanagan Indian from beyond the Rockies, on his arm, very much
<i>grande dame</i> in her attire and bearing, "a fine bird as
well as carrying fine feathers," Sam told him afterwards, talking
of those he had met there.</p>

<p>The morning after Fair Day, Angus saw an unexpected side of
Mrs. Fraser. Never had he known her thus. Her voice was harsh.
All day long she flyted at Hector, at Fiona, and Flora on sight,
even glared at her man when he came in whistling.</p>

<p>"You come to deave me with your whistling!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Fraser winked at the young folks, and they nudged each other
with their elbows. Suddenly Mrs. Fraser, seeing that, sat down in
a chair and laughed, holding her sides.</p>

<p>"I'm tired out," she said, "with all the work of the
Fair."</p>

<p>"Certainly we know the cause, whatever," replied her husband,
laughing too.</p>

<p>A few minutes later she was up and blazing at her family
again. Next day it was--</p>

<p>"Well, Mother, how are ye feeling today?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't mak' fun o' me, you young folk," she begged. "Nor
you either, Angus."</p>

<p>Memories--memories to carry away out into the Great Plains:
Fiona, who looked after the hens, hurrying across the dooryard
with a tilted stream of them craning like race horses behind her
in hopeful pursuit, feeding-time drawing near; Fiona and Hector
milking in the long dusky byre, her cheek resting against the red
and white of a cow's flank, looking up at Angus's entrance with
merry eyes. He found another milking-stool and sat down to
help.</p>

<p>"She'll hold it!" Fiona called to him. "That one will hold it
from you. She'll only let me milk her."</p>

<p>At the sound of a steady <i>rush-rush</i> into the pail,
Hector looked round from the cow he sat by.</p>

<p>"It's good you hadna a bet on it, Fiona!" he said. Nothings,
nothings to remember . . . no, much to remember--happier memories
than those of the Ettrick bookshop.</p>

<p>It was not the time for the departure of one of the great
brigades that, miles long, undulated over the waves of that
grassy sea to west, rippled by the hour past poplar groves,
dipped into coulees, twined up their sides like a mighty snake;
but with a brigade that surely sent up sufficient sound from its
ungreased wheels, they set out--Sam and Angus--for Edmonton, by
that dapple of forts splashed across a thousand miles, Ellice and
Carlton (the Touchwood Hills Post then abandoned), and Fort
Pitt.</p>

<p>At Edmonton, Angus promptly decided what was to be his means
of support in this land that had called him back. Prospectors
were arriving there with gold-dust and nuggets from the rivers,
Saskatchewan, Smoky, even the more distant headwaters of the
Peace. So there he bade adieu to Sam and saw him ride away on the
Jasper trail in the direction of the mountain passes.</p>

<p>But before he began his labours on the sand-bars, Angus made
inquiries for any he had known before there. Buchanan and Renwick
had gone to Edmonton to the boatbuilding, but left a while back,
Renwick moving eastward and Buchanan westward. Of Tom no word
returned; Buchanan--as Sam discovered--was on the Fraser
River.</p>

<p>It was truly rather for more news of Minota than for the sake
of seeing any old friends that he had made these inquiries. Here,
in this part of the west, memory of her was with him in the
scents and the sounds. The Company's people recalled well that
the Red Shield band was exterminated but where, out in their
wanderings after the buffalo, none could inform him.</p>

<p>He decided to go to the Mountain House--there might be those
there who could tell him more--before beginning upon the work
that was to give him sustenance, if not fortune, in the land that
had called him back. But no more was known there than had been
written to him. The letter he had sent to her, care of the
factor, had been delivered. Someone, he hoped, had read it to
her. If only he had taught her to read and write. If only: the
distant sound of a river's passage, the rising and falling sigh
of wind in trees, were like a threnody for her, his dear
<i>sauvage!</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There were many men drifting into Fort Edmonton then and
building cabins nearby, to winter there, of a type new to those
parts--men young and old, some who had been in California in the
great gold excitement of '49 and in the Cariboo country in the
excitement of '60.</p>

<p>The rudiments of their calling it was not hard to pick up, and
for the next three years, both above and below Edmonton, Angus
was looking for <i>colour</i> and finding it, washing gold-dust
and nuggets with considerable success. The Ettrick establishment
must have been to him even more tedious than he knew, for all the
while he was relishing his new life not only for itself but for
the escape it gave him from all that may best be symbolized as
the Wee Black Book. Coming into Edmonton at the beginning of the
winter of his second year he found all talking of troublous
doings by Red River. The M&eacute;tis of Winnipeg, by Fort Garry,
ever since Confederation, two years before, had been anxious
regarding their status. Transfer of the Northwest Territory from
the Company to the Dominion agitated them. The transfer had been
fixed for that winter and such was the news, these French
half-breeds and descendants of half-breeds, of the old
<i>coureurs de bois</i>, refused to recognize the new rule. The
arrival of survey parties in the Red River Settlements had
further excited them. They challenged the entry of the
Lieut.-Governor, took possession of Fort Garry, hauled down the
Union Jack, hauled up their fleur-de-lys and shamrocks.</p>

<p>Angus was troubled for the safety of the Frasers, but the
general opinion was that the Scots would not be involved, though
later, renewing his fears, came news that the British-Canadian
settlers at Portage la Prairie were up in arms at that exchange
of flags, talking of an assault on Fort Garry to drive out the
French half-breeds and their leader, Louis Riel, and switch the
bunting again. It's nothing, it will soon be over, was the
general view. In the spring came the news of the repulse of those
who would retake the fort, the capture and execution, by Riel, of
one of the leaders. A military force was toiling west, by Lake of
the Woods and Rainy Lakes, from Fort William to quell the
insurgents who, it seemed, since that assault on their fort had
merely sat there, in occupancy, under their flag. No need to
worry about Kildonan, however; so he went back to his placering
in the Upper Saskatchewan sands, and on his first return to
Edmonton he heard that all that fracas was over. The soldiers had
arrived, Riel and his men had walked out. That was all. And there
ended, for Angus--the whole affair like thunder over the
horizon--what was called the First Riel Rebellion.</p>

<p>Other news came, from another quarter, from southward. The
Blackfoot Confederacy were not taking the influx of prospectors
as lightly as were the Crees. A band of Piegans, under a chief
called Black Weasel, was contesting the passage of the miners
through their lands. So far what had befallen had been considered
as the fortune of war, the chance of the frontier. Prospectors
attacked Piegans, and Piegans attacked prospectors. Then a man of
the fur company at Fort Benton did what no fur company employee
should be so foolish as to do. He lost his temper with a young
raiding Piegan and took his fist to him.</p>

<p>"It can't be done," said Macaulay at Jasper House.</p>

<p>The fat was in the fire. The young man told of the assault to
his people and they came into the fort and settled the matter
with the crack of a rifle. So <i>an example</i> had to be made.
Out from the military post, Fort Shaw, went a Colonel Baker, one
of General Sheridan's officers (he whose slogan was that the only
good Indian is a dead Indian), to find the Black Weasel band. He
failed to do so, but decided that any band would serve. He took
his force charging one dawn into the sleeping camp of Bear Head
and made <i>the example</i> there, killing men, women and
children to the number of a hundred and fifty or so, set fire to
the lodges, and rode proudly away.</p>

<p>"It's not the first thing of its kind," said Hardisty at
Edmonton, and took from his shelves one of the volumes of
Alexander Ross's journals.</p>

<p>He searched briefly for a page, found it and, pointing to a
paragraph, handed the book to Angus.</p>

<p>"Passed a deserted Piegan camp of thirty-six lodges rendered
immemorial as the place where ten Piegan murderers of our people
were burnt to death--" Angus read.</p>

<p>He handed it back moodily. He was, in memory, back-in a
cottage of Lasswade and Jessie Grant, with an inexplicable
eagerness, a smile that was as a veneer of malice, was taunting
him with the Minnesota massacre. He wished he had read the Ross
journals (they were published before the time of that visit), for
then could he have the better countered her attack with that
reference to white men burning their enemies to death. No matter!
He waved away again the cottage at Lasswade, annoyed at himself
that across the years that talk could rankle.</p>

<p>"It's all deplorable," said Hardisty. "These Blackfeet, these
Piegan, are none so bad, properly handled. They are good hosts.
Palliser, and others before him, away back to Anthony Hendry,
have told us that. The marvel to me is that they can, and do,
distinguish between white friend and white enemy. The marvel is
that they don't think, as Baker did, that all that matters is the
complexion--and bang!"</p>

<p>"It may make things worse," remarked Angus.</p>

<p>"It may make things worse," agreed Hardisty.</p>

<p>Angus returned again to his placering, entirely at ease
regarding the Frasers, realizing that those who said it was but a
storm in a teacup at Fort Garry had been right. He decided to go
downstream, built a raft and set out, trying here, trying there,
at likely bars and bends, living chiefly on the land, staying a
day or two at one promising place and then, rocker and shovel
aboard, pulling again into the current.</p>

<p>Where Vermilion Creek flows into the North Fork he halted a
day or two and was amazed at the number of ravens he saw flapping
by. He had a sense--inherited, perhaps, from his mother--of the
sinister ahead. A raven or two was all in order, but there were
too many black wings for a man alone, even one who had sloughed
the fancies of his ancestors. There came into his head:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In behint yon auld fail-dyke<br>
 I wot there lies a new-slain knight . . ."</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too many corbies! And it is not good for a man to be
alone.</p>

<p>A notion came to him to float down to Fort Pitt, get horses
there, ride to Kildonan and winter with the Frasers that year
instead of again staying at Edmonton. So he passed out into the
flow of the river and duly arrived at Fort Pitt--and gloom.</p>

<p>He read it on the faces of all as soon as he got there. Soon
he heard the cause: smallpox was on the prairies.</p>

<p>"It's bad," said the factor, "very bad. We've heard that its
extent is from Missouri to Saskatchewan. The Blackfeet are dying
like flies with it. Neither measles nor smallpox can these people
withstand--both comparatively new to them. I believe the first
great smallpox epidemic was no further back than '37."</p>

<p>Even as they were speaking an eerie outcry came to them. They
had the manner--all there--as of men turned to stone. They
stepped to the door and listened and looked. There was a sound of
chanting drawing nearer, weird, repetitive, that rose and fell so
that one could not be certain at first whether it came so as the
rise and fall of the little winds decreed or by reason of the
manner in which it was intoned.</p>

<p>"There they come!"</p>

<p>Riding up the rise to the fort were those who sang--a
slow-moving cavalcade of Indians. As they came closer there was
something fearsome in their voices.</p>

<p>"It's like people singing in their sleep," said Angus.</p>

<p>"Or in fever," replied the factor.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, look at what comes here--at this one in the
lead!" exclaimed one of the clerks.</p>

<p>They were all armed, though this was no war party. They did
not shake wavering war-whoops into the air. It was a phalanx of
the moribund that rode up to the fort. This was a funeral
cort&egrave;ge: they sang themselves to death. Behind them,
flapping heavy, were ravens against the blue. An odour preceded
them. The first wave of it came sickeningly; then those poor folk
were all round them in all stages of the disease. They rode
slowly (the very deliberateness had its horror) all round the
fort, in among the buildings before any there could think what to
do.</p>

<p>Close to Angus passed a squaw with her face woefully swelled,
her eyes apparently unseeing. On her back was a child, pouched in
the slack of the blanket she clutched round her, in the act of
having convulsions. Some of them had the pustules all over their
bodies, others had got to the last stages, their faces so bloated
that hardly could one see the features, the eyes sunk away in the
swellings. Still, in a kind of herd hypnotism, they raised their
melancholy recitative.</p>

<p>Angus stood at the door of the old trade-room staring out at
them. Behind him was a man who seemed not to be a member of the
staff but some traveller halted there on the way.</p>

<p>"This is hell we are in!" he was exclaiming, walking up and
down.</p>

<p>Angus, very troubled, turned to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake! You don't help by telling us that," he
snapped.</p>

<p>"Hell," repeated the man solemnly. "Hell we are in," and he
continued to pace back and forth.</p>

<p>The Indians were riding into the place. They dropped from
their horses. They came to the factor, who awaited them
anxiously, came beseechingly, not combative, spreading their
hands wide and drawing them back to their bodies in the sign for
<i>Pity us.</i> They said, "Take this from us." They asked him,
as though superstitiously believing that here was punishment for
sin, "What have we done to get this?"</p>

<p>From inside the trade-room came the voice of that man: ". . .
hell we are in . . ."</p>

<p>"You white men know much. Our medicine-men can do nothing,"
the Indians pled. "White men brought it. White men can take it
from us."</p>

<p>Angus stared from one to another, wondering then what these
were about. They were rubbing their sores against the walls. He
thought at first it was because they itched, then realized it was
not for that. They had clearly come there with an object; they
had had an Idea. One and another would burst a pustule on him or
her and smear the matter on walls, outhouse latches, or door
handles. He listened acutely to the chanting:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The white man gave it to us.<br>
 The white man gave it to us.<br>
 Take it back to the white man.<br>
 Leave it with the white man.<br>
 Leave it with the white man,<br>
 Then we shall be well again."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>That was the chant with which they rode. They made no show of
anger. None suggested to kill a white man. They were possessed
but by that one thought: <i>The white man gave it to us; take it
back to the white man.</i></p>

<p>There was a feeling as of nightmare at high noon in talking to
these people who, had they been of his colour (thought Angus)
would surely have all by then been abed--and dead abed. What
amazing vitality kept them in their saddles! When one dismounted
he fell and could not rise. Some, it would appear, had succeeded
only by some superb effort of will in coming so far and, having
arrived, the will snapped. They lurched from their horses and
where they fell they lay. The red trickles of haemorrhages were
on their saddles.</p>

<p>"Are you in pain?" Angus asked one after another, and all
replied, "No--no pain," which eased, a little, the horror, the
pity of it.</p>

<p>"We are sending runners to Fort Edmonton west," the factor
told them, "to Fort Carlton east, to see if at either of these
places there is any medicine for the disease."</p>

<p>"If you give me a horse I'll ride one way," said Angus.</p>

<p>"The messengers are off already," replied the factor.</p>

<p>So Angus moved over to tell others who were not near and might
not have heard. One to whom he spoke--no visible part of him
without sign of his malady--listened the more eagerly, no doubt,
because Angus addressed him in Cree. Then--with no intention of
infecting him, that was clear, but in gratitude--the man shook
hands with him. The feel of that palm was dreadful, but Angus did
not snatch his own away.</p>

<p>Having done what they had done (smeared latches, sills and
walls), the Indians were prepared to listen to the factor who
went among them, advising all to go into camp and lie quiet
there. Above all, he warned them, none should take a sweat-bath
and leap into the river, which was their cure for many ailments.
They had found that out, it appeared. They did not need to be
told. On the South Fork the bodies of those who had followed such
treatment were drifting downriver as sometimes the buffalo, that
crossed at bad places and could not climb a bank, were seen
wallowing along, Blackfeet bodies were spinning down the flow,
into the Cree country.</p>

<p>Next moment there was the crash of a gun within the fort.
Angus thought that some had begun to kill and hurried indoors to
see what had happened. It seemed that one of the Indians had
stood before a mirror looking at his face. He was a young chief,
very vain, known as Handsome Man. He saw his bloated features in
the glass, began to weep, then put his rifle-butt to the ground,
withdrew his moccasin before those inside could see what he was
about, and pressed the trigger with his great toe.</p>

<p>". . . hell we are in . . ."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, shut up!" cried Angus.</p>

<p>As they had come they went, keening high and plaintive,
singing their death-songs; and as the band departed, moving down
to the river, one after another caromed out of the saddle, unable
to balance, when the horses, dropping their heads to the descent,
went mincing down the slope. Where they fell they lay, the
extraordinary vitality at end.</p>

<p>All of two hundred miles to Edmonton, all of two hundred and
fifty to Carlton--even if there were medicines there what would
they avail? It was too late. Nevertheless, in both directions
runners were off in hope of aid.</p>

<p>The sun sank. The stars came out and the Milky Way was a whirl
of uncounted, uncountable sparks across the sky. But the air of
the prairie was heavy with the odour of the Great Sickness, and
on the rolling hills by the river banks all night long rose the
ululating laughter of the coyotes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>So he did not go on to Fort Garry. He might take the sickness
with him, he considered, on his clothes even if, for himself, he
escaped. A few days he remained to help there in the melancholy
duty of burying those dead who had fallen close by, while the
whimper and babbling of coyotes and the bay of wolves sounded
through the land.</p>

<p>The messengers returned from east and west empty-handed. The
raft on which he had floated down river he left by the bank for
the service of any who cared or for the spring freshets to carry
away and, buying pack and saddle horses, turned back to Edmonton,
thinking much of Minota. Measles or smallpox--it was all the same
to these people, both but recent afflictions to their blood.</p>

<p>He decided, the intention of wintering at Kildonan abandoned,
to go west into the hills and build a cabin for himself by one of
the tributaries of North Saskatchewan where he had, earlier,
found colour sufficient to warrant that. The usage of many of
packing out in the spring through the mire of the thaws to their
gold-getting, packing back with the first snows to hibernate in
cabins near the fort, was not to his mind. He joined the company
of those who were even then dotted solitary, fellows in method
but far-sundered, along the ranges west, memorials of whose
occupancy of sequestered valley or high rocky basin may still be
encountered by the chance traveller--a roof fallen in years ago
surrounded by the ant-ridden logs, or dust of logs that were once
cosy walls, in tell-tale parallelogram.</p>

<p>Nearer to Jasper House than to Fort Edmonton was his chosen
location. There was time still before the snows, though there
were hints of yellow among the stands of trees. He had known of
winter hardly coming until Christmas week; he had known of it
setting in by October, making a sudden end to Indian summer,
swooping abruptly with blizzard instead of coming by slow
degrees. He had, in fact, the roof on his cabin before even the
snow of tamarack needles was falling. A snowing of needles: that
seemed the only way to describe the drift of these frail yellow
splinters.</p>

<p>Time flew. At Edmonton there were books (it surprised, for
some reason, many visitors of those days to see the factor's
library) and Angus had brought some with him. Macaulay of Jasper
House had books also, and told him to help himself. When the
first snow came (a mere sifting of white on that yellow carpet of
the forest) came also two blue jays. Perched on a branch nearby,
erecting their crests, they gave him a raucous <i>Hullo!</i> He
acknowledged their call by tossing to them some scraps of
food.</p>

<p>The snow vanished, as in a turning back of the year, and the
jays vanished also. Squirrels were frequently springing their
rattles at him as he worked, wood-chopping. Their granaries were
no doubt full, their busy days over for the season. But even so,
after that first white powdering there was a sense of waiting,
expectancy, tranquil expectancy, resignation, in that green
domain. Then came a morning when he awoke to a new light in the
shack, a trembling radiance. He looked out. The woods were
filling up with snow. The flakes came quaking down. All night,
thought he, they must have been falling. The boughs of the pines
were bent with the load upon them. There was a screech without:
the blue jays had returned.</p>

<p>They remained in the vicinity for his company, his
eleemosynary scraps, one so little timid that when, on mild days,
he let his door stand open it would come perkily in. To begin
with it demanded. Anon it took. It would perch on the table when
he ate and with a beady eye upon him snatch the morsel he tossed
across to it, gobble it down or flirt away with it, a blue flash
of wings in the doorway. Cold days coming, necessitating the
closing of the door, he chipped a small hole in it, put a landing
perch beside that both inside and outside, and then awaited
evidence (or lack of it) of a blue jay's intelligence. In the way
of men alone he ridiculously scratched with a knife-point IN--OUT
on either side of the hole.</p>

<p>The jay, greatly daring, after several decisions to do so,
that were suddenly vetoed when half in and half out, adventured
at last. By week's end it was in and out as it pleased. It became
bolder. It would leap upon a piece of meat on the table and,
taking firm hold with its claws, insert its vicious beak and with
a backward jerk tug off slivers. Sometimes so great a chunk did
it wrench away that in the hole, fluttering off with the portion,
it had difficulties. The meat would fall, Angus would go to pick
it up, and the jay would fly screeching round the cabin till he
opened the door--and out it could dart.</p>

<p>Once, in midwinter, when there was blue sky above and
sunshine, he went to Jasper House on snowshoes, for converse with
his kind, through woods intensely quiet, all the streams frozen
and happed over with the drifts. The trail he left behind showed
deep mauve shadows in the faint blue of that world. Now and then
a laden tree would quiver and toss from it the weight it had been
bearing. For a moment beside it was a ghost tree, or a jet, a
falling jet of rainbow-tinted points. A little sigh as it
fell--and the silence deepened again.</p>

<p>Half a mile from home on his return there came a shriek and
two flutters of dark blue. There were his friends, or his
beggars, to welcome him.</p>

<p>"It's only your insides you think of," he told them, but
nevertheless was gratified by the reception.</p>

<p>The shortest day came, and each morning's light seeped earlier
into his cabin. The jays, without, rose at dawn, and at dawn they
clamoured to be fed. Morning after morning they screamed him
awake. To pay no attention was of no avail: they but screeched
the louder. The forward one alighted on its perch and rapped at
the plug he had put in the hole to prevent a whistling draught
overnight. He fed them with exasperation.</p>

<p>"You can support yourselves perfectly well without me," he
complained. "Why don't you get your own breakfasts and come to
dinner instead?"</p>

<p>And then--</p>

<p>One morning he was drawn from profound slumber by that
domineering yell. Half awake, half asleep, the screams
continuing, he rose, opened wide the door. The jay,
alarmed--perhaps it had expected only the removal of the
plug--dashed against his breast and at the impact, sleep still in
his eyes, he caught it and (of his own momentary volition) wrung
its neck.</p>

<p>He sat down, fully awake then, with the dead bird in his hand,
sat so long that he found himself quaking with the cold, rose,
shut the door, built up his fire and, standing there, looked at
the stiffening corpse on his table in misery.</p>

<p>Outside, the bird's mate shouted anxiously. Having done what
he had done, there was more to do. He went outside. There was the
other bird on a bush, with demented eye, yelling on and on. Angus
crossed to a bank where the snow had fallen away, thus exposing
the soil, found there some stones that he could kick free from
the frost that held them to the earth, and the first one he threw
was aimed well. The partner of the bird he had murdered dropped
without another sound.</p>

<p>He buried both together in the bank where he had found the
stones. The silence of the forest round him was then almost
unbearable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c15">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Progress</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Often he remembered George Catlin walking with him to the door
of that hall in Edinburgh, saying, "It's changing, it's all
changing . . ." For always there was some drear news when, having
shut his cabin door and trudged through the woods, he arrived at
Jasper House.</p>

<p>Blackfeet and Cree were constantly at war then. Each lay in
wait for the other round the prairie forts in a chronic feud, the
revenge of one but the reprisal, it seemed, for the revenge of
the other.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Macaulay at Jasper House, "that some Plains
Assiniboine and Crees, out together after buffalo, came on a
Piegan camp near Cypress Hills in which were only the old men,
the women, and children, the able-bodied men out hunting, and
wiped them all out except one lad who escaped and got down to one
of the free traders' forts. I think that's what started this
trouble. We are beyond little horse-stealing forays now. It's
bloody war all the time."</p>

<p>As the factor spoke, Angus was moodily back in the Cameron
parlour at Lasswade. "Jessie would be delighted to hear of that,"
he thought. A pity he did not realize that she had been but
trying to annoy him because of his dilatoriness in seeking her
out, realize the obliquity of her attack. He could then have
lightly laughed Lasswade into Limbo.</p>

<p>On one occasion he went to Edmonton and the place was changed.
Foreboding lurked strangely even in the shadows under its eaves,
in the echo of the voices and steps in its gateways. Men of a
type new to him were there. They seemed to be, in verity, what
his mother imagined that some she had seen in doorways of the
way-houses of Minnesota were. He looked on at an exhibition of
their shooting, evidently in response to some challenge following
a vaunt. One stepped from a group and, with a quick glance to see
that no one was beyond him, held up a fifty-cent piece between
thumb and finger. His partner marched away fifty paces, wheeled,
and on the instant shot the coin into the air full centre. Then,
when another who watched the display cried out, "Well, you've
done it, but all the same I would not like to be the one to hold
the half-dollar," the marksman glanced at him and, as he turned
his head, shot the cheroot from his mouth. The glitter of his
eyes, alert for any resentment, was steely as a poised
lynx's.</p>

<p>The Company's staff told Angus of callous killings there.
Whisky smugglers were on the way to being cynical lords of that
region. Fortunately, they told him, when the Indians get
drunk--and drink-crazed, in their way--they kept to themselves.
The bacchanalian screams could be heard all night at times, off
in the woods--and occasional shots. As he listened to these
stories he recalled that queer man who was at Fort Pitt when the
band with smallpox rode in, he who walked to and fro in the
trade-room, declaiming: "This is hell we are in."</p>

<p>He heard (appropriately to that memory) that shortly after he
had left to go west to the mountains a military man, Captain W.
F. Butler, had arrived on government service, bringing with him
medicine chests against a recurrence of that plague, and leaflets
and booklets of advice in case of an epidemic. The illustrations
in these reminded Angus of some proselytizing, terrorizing
pictures Minota had once shown him dealing with afflicted souls
instead of bodies. Captain Butler had also been bearer of
official papers to certain factors and others in the land, giving
them judicial rights, power to try and convict law-breakers.</p>

<p>"But what's the good?" they said. "What's the good of creating
Magistrates or Justices of the Peace when there is no force
either to maintain law or to arrest for infringement?"</p>

<p>Yes, it would appear this was hell they were in. Certain lakes
nearby had been christened Drunken Lakes because of the orgies
that took place in their neighbourhood. Yet there was a line of
demarkation. Hell did not extend to the foothills. The North
Trail, that wound along their verge, was its western boundary.
The Mountain Assiniboines (the Stoneys) seemed to be escaping
this demoralization.</p>

<p>Angus was not sorry to be gone again from Edmonton westward.
With Macaulay he discussed the changes.</p>

<p>"A variety of causes," Macaulay suggested. "The buffalo are
going, so they fight over their hunting more. And it's a case
now, with some of the traders, of no thought for the morrow.
Certainly that's the attitude of the whisky peddlers. They don't
care if the goose with the golden eggs is killed. They demand
buffalo robes for carriage wraps in the east. I hear also that
the navvies building the railways down south are fed on buffalo.
Beef contractors are killing them wholesale. Some white men--so
an Indian told me the other day--will kill a buffalo for no more
than its tongue, that's all, and leave the rest to the wolves. As
for the Indians themselves, there is a sort of racial
depression."</p>

<p>"No wonder!"</p>

<p>"No. It's deep. The smallpox was heap big depression for them.
If things go on this way they are going to be a poor pock-marked
race of drunkards if nothing is done to stop it. That last
outbreak must have brought them down to a quarter. I can
understand it. You know the tendency of many white men when hard
luck follows hard luck. And what do some of these so-called
whisky peddlers give them even under the name of whisky or rum?
Ammonia and blue-stone water, and water that tobacco has been
steeped in, and a jolt of rum to top it off."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes! Any concoction will serve. But even when they peddle
genuine stuff--and even if they water it--how does an Indian
drink? By the pint, by the quart. You hear people say that they
can't carry their liquor, that a smell of the cork will set them
raving. I doubt it. They don't know the meaning of <i>a nip.</i>
The whisky smugglers have forts such as none of the old Northwest
forts were like--double-walled, some of them. And do they let
their customers into the trade-rooms even in small groups? No,
sir! Their trade is almost entirely in buffalo robes: a robe is
pushed in at a wicket and a jug of watered rum, or whisky--if not
worse--is pushed out in exchange. When the band is raving the
peddlers sit tight inside with loaded rifles."</p>

<p>"It's hell!"</p>

<p>"It's hell. I hear that Father Lacome has sent an account of
the condition of affairs to Ottawa and that two Methodists--the
two MacDougalls--have done the same, and that man Sandford
Fleming, who has the job of surveying a railway route across the
prairies and through to the Pacific, has done the same."</p>

<p>Something familiar in that to Angus--that railway. He wondered
if Sam Douglas was still over the ranges in the Cariboo
gold-fields, wished he would write. But the passage of letters
through the land was uncertain.</p>

<p>He went back to his cabin in the mountains, and to his
placering there, as one going to a sanctuary. Yes, he was glad
Minota had not lived into these days: <i>A pock-marked</i>
<i>race of drunkards if nothing is done to stop it.</i></p>

<p>The following year when he went to Fort Edmonton he was
prepared to be attacked on the way by some of the new element, he
obviously a returning prospector. But no, they had not yet gone
as far as that. He <i>bellied up to the blower</i>--which is to
say, he had his dust weighed on the scales, blown onto the
scales, as the custom was, with a diminutive bellows. A placer
miner from the Saskatchewan river was behind him and fell in
talk.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a great life," he told Angus. "I've got my money
in the bank, the sandy bank of Saskatchewan. I go for three
months and dig some out and come and belly up to the blower, and
<i>blow</i> it. These Indian women are fine. By, God, these
people have no morals at all! They are so keen on liquor that a
buck will come along to my shack and peddle me his squaw to get
the price of a jolt of rum. They have no morals at all."</p>

<p>Angus turned away.</p>

<p>He moved back to Jasper House, stayed a night there, talked
awhile (in the sign language) in the morning to a party of
Sarcees who were there trading, and then went his way. A month
later, lonesome suddenly, he returned to the post. Always dismal
news! A party of whisky traders down in the Cypress Hills had
massacred a band of Assiniboines there after having sold them all
the whisky they had.</p>

<p>"After trading?"</p>

<p>"Yes, peddled the stuff right in the open away from their
fortresses and then lay round the camp on a bluff, and when night
came, and the tepees were lit with the fires, riddled them with
bullets."</p>

<p>"What was the idea?"</p>

<p>"I've been trying to arrive at that," replied Macaulay. "I
think I've got it."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Fear. It is all very well in one of their strong forts to
play that game, but out in the open, if a horde of drink-crazed
Indians come demanding more and there's no more to give--or if
the Indians have no more robes to offer in trade--what then?
That's the only explanation I can think of. Fear. They gave them
the liquor and then, when the orgy got into full swing, they got
scared. Fear, cowardice, and cynicism deep as the Pit. That's all
I can think of as explanation. It's bad enough. I would hate to
think it was done just for hellery and fun!"</p>

<p>That was the end of it. Cleric and layman, priest and parson,
Hudson's Bay factor, surveyors, and free traders of another sort
let Ottawa know of the progress of civilization on the great
plateau.</p>

<p>It was in a letter from Fiona that Angus had the first news of
the result of these pleas, a long letter beginning with the
family gossip and passing on to tell of a change at The Stone
Fort (Lower Fort Garry, Kildonan way), how a military force was
installed in half of it, and drilling there. "That dreadful
massacre in the Cypress Hills," she wrote, "was what brought the
decision to police the plains . . ."</p>

<p>Angus looked up.</p>

<p>"They're going to police the plains," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh--it's in your letter, is it? I was going to tell you. That
news is a bit tardy now. They <i>are</i> policing the plains--the
Northwest Mounted Police. I had word by the man who brought in
the mails from Edmonton. The Redcoats are there and there's
another body of them away down somewhere in the Cypress Hills.
The J.P.'s and the magistrates won't have to look upon themselves
as impotent much longer."</p>

<p>No letter from Sam, who was often at that time in Angus's
mind. Again there was talk of the railway coming through. That
man Sandford Fleming, they said, was not going to be beaten.</p>

<p>It was not till the following year that there was news from
Douglas. Opening the letter, Angus was puzzled. It was headed
<i>Fort Calgarry.</i></p>

<p>"Where's Fort Calgarry?" he asked. "Has the company
established a new post that I haven't heard of?"</p>

<p>"The company has just established a new trading-post there, as
a matter of fact, but it's really the new name of Fort
Brisebois."</p>

<p>"I never heard of Fort Brisebois."</p>

<p>"Of course not--out of the world! It's a fort of the mounted
police. It was named Brisebois after one of the officers of the
force, but is called Calgarry now, after the birthplace of their
colonel, Macleod."</p>

<p>"But where is it?"</p>

<p>"South. About as far south of the old Mountain House as
Edmonton is north of it. On the Bow River. Why?"</p>

<p>"This letter is from an old friend who is there now. He says
that the railway will be in any day--"</p>

<p>"Any day! Some day, he means. Your friend is an optimist."</p>

<p>"It's Sam Douglas, Sam Lovat Douglas, the--"</p>

<p>"Oh, he wintered here some years ago. I remember him well.
He's got a future, if he lives."</p>

<p>"He's started a business and says it is a good-going
concern--a freighting business. He wants me to join him." Angus
glanced at the letter, "'Unless,' says he, 'you are making a
fortune at your placering.'"</p>

<p>"Well, if you decide to join him you can ride down with no
dread of losing your scalp on the way now. The mounted police
have done away with that danger."</p>

<p>Angus went back to his cabin to pack and depart, left it for
the squirrels to play upon its roof and for the tamarack needles
to drizzle down upon and the snow to fall upon these, left it as
though ending a life. He went on his way to meet Sam Douglas and
to discover, as it befell anon, that the past lived on and the
portion of his life ahead had, indeed, indeed, close link with
portions past.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c16">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>S. D.</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Douglas looked older. That was Angus's first thought on
meeting him at Fort Calgarry. His second was that close on twenty
years had passed since they first crossed the plains together
from Fort Garry to Carlton, and ten since the second traverse and
the farewell at Edmonton, Sam going on to the Cariboo country
beyond the ranges.</p>

<p>Dismounting from his horse at the long, low, mud-roofed log
cabin that squatted beside tall barns and a pole-corral, with the
legend over its door <i>S. D. Transport and Haulage</i>, Sam
hurrying out to meet him, Angus had the emotion of meeting an old
friend. Here, in the moment of reunion, aware they had their
disparities, were different temperamentally in many ways, he had
that emotion of friendship, long friendship. Yes, Douglas looked
older, despite an effervescent vitality announced in gait,
brightness of eyes, and tone of voice. But, of course, he would
look older, thought Angus, leading his horses to the corral,
Douglas in step beside him, for the years had been flying.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come," said Sam, helping him at the
unsaddling. "This is going to be the hub of the West. Thirteen
lines, they tell me, the engineers have surveyed, and it's down
to a choice between the T&ecirc;te Janue Cache and the pass back
of us here. I'm gambling on this one--because it's farther south.
It's coming any day now. Next year, I believe, they will be
laying the steel across the plains."</p>

<p>Had there been anyone at Fort Calgarry then gifted with
prevision to tell Sam that ten years or so would slip away before
the hoot of a locomotive sounded there he would have pshawed
aside the claims to second-sight and all such occult gifts in
that depressing prophet.</p>

<p>There, at any rate, at whatever date steel would come, was a
little frontier town hard by the confluence of Elbow River with
the Bow. The blast of a bugle from time to time, over at the
Northwest Mounted Police post, was a fanfare, in Douglas's ears,
proclaiming great things to come, as in Edinburgh once bugles at
the castle had been to Angus as though making an airy flourish
over his escape from the Wee Black Book.</p>

<p>The air of the place was like a tonic. A vision of the Rocky
Mountains wavering along the verge of sky (a sky, that day, of
the hue that gleams inside the river mussel-shells) somehow
uplifted the heart.</p>

<p>"We'll ride round and look at the city later," said Sam; and
later they did so, Douglas an eager, an ardent cicerone.</p>

<p>"There's the Roman Catholic Mission," he said. "And there's
the Wesleyan. Yon's the Government post. That's the interpreter's
house." They rode on. "Here's the I. G. Baker store and the I. G.
Baker barns and stables." (They were much like those of the <i>S.
D.</i> <i>Transport and Haulage).</i> "This is the Elbow River
we're coasting now. There's the ford--and a horseman crossing
it." They reined in on the bank to watch a raft drift past.
"There are camps," explained Sam, "away back in the timbered
hills where they are felling trees for the building of this great
western metropolis."</p>

<p>A memory of the flat-boats on Red River came to Angus as he
watched that raft drift past. As they rode back a string of
wagons was rolling in from east. They reminded him of the Red
River carts, which were small, each hauled by but one ox,
different from these. The great wagons, to the slow-swaying
trudge of many yoked bullocks that hauled them, came nearer.</p>

<p>"We hitch these carts three together," said Sam, "and in the
three is just a fair load for twenty oxen. It's a great idea, a
great scheme, simple, like many a great scheme. In the rains
there's whiles muddy places between here and Fort Brenton, and
when the wagons get mired--they're up to the hubs at times--the
drivers just uncouple the two rear ones, haul the lead to good
ground and then go back with the oxen and bring the others, one
at a time, link them up again, and away they go. The Benton Trail
is safe for travel now. When the Redcoats came in there the
whisky peddlers just walked out, the way Riel walked out at Fort
Garry, I heard, when Wolseley arrived--not that there is any
comparison between Riel, with his half-breeds anxious over their
future, watching all the Government surveyors poking round there
since the company relinquished to the Dominion, and these
whisky-traders. Yes, I've got nine wagons for that work--sixty
bulls, as they call the oxen here--and I've got fifty pack horses
for the transport work into the Kicking Horse Pass. They call it
that because of an accident to Dr. Hector, who was in there with
Palliser years ago. He got kicked over a cliff by a pony that had
gotten its lines fankled up with the tail of the horse ahead, or
something, and was jibbing. I'm told they thought he was a dead
man when they picked him up. Aye, I have pack horses for packing
into the surveyors and the miners in the mountains." He paused.
"So you see I need a foreman, Angus. I'll be out and about quite
a bit. The cattlemen are heading into the buffalo ranges of
Montana already. I'm in touch at the moment with some folk in the
old country relative to the starting up of cattle here. Talking
of letter-writing: we've got a fine mail service here. The police
patrol handles it. They have a box in the orderly room. It goes
once a week to MacLeod, once a fortnight for the big world
beyond. You have to put American stamps on the letters, for they
carry them down either to Fort Benton or Fort Shaw. Think of
that--a fortnightly mail service! Yes, I need a man I can leave
in charge when I'm looking after other matters. I think there's
going to be money in bringing cattle in here. I've a young
Englishman working for me who was on a ranch in Montana. I gather
he was a scamp and was thrown out by his father, but he's no
scamp with horses is Gus. Just little more than a laddie, in his
early twenties. What's your age, Angus?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five."</p>

<p>"Godsakes! I'm five years older than you. I've lived half the
span allotted, but I'm going to live long enough, by the grace of
God and the air of these parts, to say to these men--d'ye mind
how we discussed with them--'I'm sorry, but I have too much on my
hands to act for anybody else now. I gave you your chance once.
It's too late!'"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you will say anything of the kind to them,"
said Angus, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe not. Well, we'll turn, I think, and ride back and
have our crack in the evening. You're no' looking at the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see them."</p>

<p>"Isn't it bonnie here? Look, do you know what it reminds me
of?" and he did not pause for Angus to reply. "It reminds me of
the Grampians as you see them from Dundee Law."</p>

<p>They rode in silence awhile, Angus, as his eyes roved the
expanse, thinking of Edinburgh and the Ettrick shop there, the
staff adread of being <i>out in the street without a
character.</i> The horses of their own accord, being very fresh,
half-broken, fell into a trot and their hoofs kept time, the
riders canted a little forward in the saddles. Then Sam spoke
again.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get up a St. Andrew's Day dinner," he said.
"Colonel Macleod would be the fitting chairman by nationality and
rank, him having just succeeded French out here as
commander-in-chief, but the man has such a quixotic sense of
probity and duty that when he saw the fluids on the table for the
toasts, in these days of prohibition of liquor, he might not just
say, 'Well, gentlemen, on an occasion such as this I must not
inquire too closely,' but get up and officially arrest us all
instead of unofficially letting it go. Yes, yes. It would be a
kind of an invidious position to put the poor man in. Of course,
they have their discretionary powers. He might decide to--be
discreet."</p>

<p>"Sam, I am indeet afraid you have in you certain of the
qualities of a damned humbug, whatever," said Angus.</p>

<p>Meeting them as they rode anyone could see they were excellent
friends. There was some bond there despite their difference in
many ways.</p>

<p>The crack in the evening was satisfactory. The men of the
<i>S.</i> <i>D. Transport and Haulage</i> were introduced to
their new foreman, Angus Munro, next day. They crushed his hand,
looked him in the eye, took his measure: a tall man and bronzed,
with no superfluous flesh on him, with a tendency, they noted, to
turn a <i>d</i> to a <i>t</i> in his speech and linger on the s
of Yes.</p>

<p>There was much for him to attend to, with bull-whackers,
bullocks, horses, horse-wranglers, orders for the local traders
and traders westward, and bookkeeping. He had been at that employ
over a year, seeing the wagons off for Fort Brenton and the pack
strings for the hills, before public and national events caught
him in private and personal fashion.</p>

<p>Local gossip was all of a treaty--Treaty Number Seven, by
name--that the Lieut.-Governor of the Northwest Territory was
bringing out to the Western tribes. Anon the day was fixed for
that conclave--the gathering to hear and discuss Treaty Number
Seven, and perhaps sign it. Time: the moon when the plums ripen,
September, and the day the 19th; place: The Ridge Under the
Water--the ford of Bow River, sixty or so miles to east of Fort
Calgarry--otherwise Blackfoot Crossing.</p>

<p>Redcoats rode off, convoying the commissioner (in his tall
hat) and other white signatories--if such they were to be:
officers of the force, a factor or two, priests, parsons and
three ladies, one the wife of Colonel Macleod, whom the Indians
called, by reason of his head and neck, Bull Head. All day long
from the door of the S. D. log-cabin office Angus could see the
Stoneys trooping on their way, befeathered, with dragging
travois-poles. All day long there rose pennants of dust when the
Sarcees passed eastward.</p>

<p>"It will be a grand thing for both Indians and whites to have
that treaty signed," said Sam, standing with him in the doorway.
"I was talking to them over at the police quarters and they say
the Indians want it, with buffalo dwindling. They're to be given
herds of cattle to take their place, and in return they are to go
to reservations. They have great confidence in Colonel Macleod. I
heard a story of him the other day. It appears a cattleman went
in to see him and ask if he, or any of his cowboys, saw an Indian
running off cattle could they shoot him? Macleod looks up across
his table and says he 'Yes,' and the man grins, and then Macleod
pins him with his eye and says he, 'But you will hang for it!'
And I hear that--"</p>

<p>He stopped, for a Redcoat was dismounting at the door and came
in with a message. The force's transport facilities were strained
by this call upon them. Had Sam a matter of a dozen pack ponies,
and a wrangler or two on hand to go off at once to the treaty
camp at the Crossing?</p>

<p>Sam turned to his foreman--who suggested, because of the
nature of the call, that he had better go himself.</p>

<p>Sam laughed.</p>

<p>"Aye," he said, "I can realize you would like to be in on
this. Off you go."</p>

<p>So off went Angus and took with him that young scamp, Gus
Atkins, who knew how to treat horses.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>Blackfoot Crossing</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was good again to be alive on the Great Plains. This was
not hell he was in, thought Angus, riding east ahead of the pack
string beneath capacious blue, across expansive plain. There was
a time, a period but lately past, when it seemed to his fancy
that even the mountains were changed by the horrors he heard of,
brooded on the horizon, and that the wind in the prairie grass
was lamentation. But a new era was quickening--as the factor at
Rocky Mountain House had remarked when he stopped a night there,
riding down to Calgarry, a year back, to meet Sam Douglas.</p>

<p>The outer world--or life, existence in that outer world--was
again not so sombre and cruel in contrast with the world of the
mind as to make his private and personal happiness seem selfish,
whether in thinking so he had been just or unjust to himself. He
swung round in the saddle to see how all went, and all went well.
Behind him in single file the ponies quick-stepped, packs swaying
just right, not more than at the end swayed Gus Atkins in the
saddle, singing. The Rockies were engraved crisply on the western
light, only a peak here and there creating and drawing down a
feathery vapour out of space. He settled foursquare in the saddle
again and looked eastward where there was no cloud at all, only
that lofty blue, that ambient spaciousness.</p>

<p>The place chosen for that great gathering of the clans,
gathering of the tribes--the Blackfeet, their septs the Bloods
and Piegans, the Stoneys and Sarcees--was beautiful in Angus's
eyes when, two days later it was suddenly revealed as a surprise
of nature. They say on the prairies: <i>There are no mountains
here but there are valleys.</i> From distance the winding gash of
the Bow River was unremarked; the impression to the eye was but
of space and space again. Flutterings of dust at great distance,
as they rode upon their way, had sometimes clearly moved,
progressed, and had sometimes seemed stationary. By the size of
these, tiny though they were in comparison with the low
circumference of the plain and the high glitter of its cupola,
Angus had surmised they indicated the Piegans and the Bloods
coming from the south. Drifts of dust ahead would be the last of
the Sarcees or Stoneys he and Sam had watched, trooping through
that bright air to the appointed place.</p>

<p>Hum of voices came up when the plateau split before them and
they saw below the tepees of the Indians on a great prairie at
the base of the bluffs and cut-banks that in the ages the
twisting river had left on either side. In the bottoms the
cottonwoods were turning yellow, their leaves twinkling beside
the diminished autumn flow. Angus could see at once where the
ford was. Rutted trails converged on it fan-wise down the slopes
and, having crossed, there was great whinnying of their horses to
the grazing herds of the Indians who watched their arrival.
Blackfeet these were by their carriage and by the three
decorative prongs on their moccasins that signified the tribe of
three in one.</p>

<p>"<i>Ok-yi!</i>" he saluted them, all the Blackfoot he
knew.</p>

<p>"<i>Ok-yi!</i>" they responded.</p>

<p>A mite of five or so was busy by one of the tepees with much
labour pulling out the tent pegs--for they used pegs as well as
the central tripod of poles. He looked back, laughing at its
solemn assiduity, watching how peg by peg was hauled up and
tossed over its shoulder. The leather wall sagged. Out came the
mother in haste, saw Angus slewed in his saddle grinning, and
observing the cause of his amusement laughed back to him as she
grabbed up the mite and carried it off astride her ample hip.</p>

<p>"<i>Ok-yi!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Ok-yi!</i>"</p>

<p>He saw a tall Indian striding slowly toward a lodge painted
with many heraldic signs. For once the chimneypot hat beloved for
state occasions by the chiefs of the plains, was not ridiculous
in contrast with the usual headgear of these people. The hat that
man wore was only the base for a circle of choice eagle-tail
feathers. His native leggings, that showed beneath a robe
gathered round him (a robe covered with bead-work, white and
yellow, a sun folding and unfolding in it as he moved), were
bead-encrusted in geometric designs, and on heavily beaded
moccasins he moved slowly by. The attire did not obliterate the
man. That was a face to remember, thought Angus--strong
cheek-bones, strong chin under close-set mouth, aquiline nose,
eyes with puzzlement in them, the face not of a savage in the
ordinary acceptance of the word but of a great man out of the
Neolithic age, not without humour. He had command of himself, by
the way he walked. He bowed in at the entrance of the painted
lodge and--</p>

<p>"Who is that?" Angus signed to a lad nearby, receiving in
answer the sign for head-chief.</p>

<p>So that was Crowfoot!</p>

<p>They rode on, whistling the pack horses forward, and came to
where the marquee of the commissioners stood with a table on the
grass before it, rode on to where the tents of the Redcoats were
pitched. There a sergeant pointed out where to unpack.</p>

<p>"Well, are they all here?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet are here, and those are the Piegans putting up
their tepees beside them. The Stoneys and the Sarcees have
come--the Stoneys are over there, and there are the Sarcee
lodges. The Bloods have not arrived. I hear they are a bit
haughty about it all."</p>

<p>Pack saddles empty, Angus and Gus rode away. They were not
wanted there. They were civilians. All might, or all might not,
go well. The Bloods had not come, and the non-arrival of one of
the parties to the second part, as it were, of that momentous
contract might shake the others.</p>

<p>As the pack string took the ford, one or two of the beasts
pausing insouciantly to drink on the way, sudden music broke out
back at the marquee, drowning the sound of tentative muffled
drummings on tomtoms--a sort of muted band-practice that had
begun among the lodges. To these gay rhythms the pack string,
with heads rising and falling, hoofs digging well down, mounted
to the plateau.</p>

<p>"Are you going straight home?" Gus called from the rear.</p>

<p>Angus shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he shouted. "We'll camp back here a bit where we saw a
slough that did not look too alkaline."</p>

<p>Others, when they reached it, were already camped beside it,
hopeful traders, hopeful for the signing of the treaty and a
disbursement of some Government money to the Indians--which might
come their way for tea, sugar, or a string of Birmingham beads.
On the other side of the slough some Crees were putting up their
tepees, come curiously there to look on at the great gathering of
their one-time enemies--friends since the Redcoats had
arrived.</p>

<p>"Have the Bloods come?" one of the traders asked Angus.</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope they don't spill the beans," said the man,
turning back to his fire of buffalo chips and a pot that hung
over it.</p>

<p>Angus and Gus moved round that little rush-bordered lake, that
was like a splinter dropped off the high blue ceiling, and there
made camp. As they ate lunch some young Crees rode away to south,
dwindling in distance, were suddenly swallowed by the earth, to
appear again anon diminished in size, drop from sight once more,
and once more appeared very small. Had Angus not been watching
them it would have been hard to tell what those jogging dots
were.</p>

<p>Gus, hugging his knees, meditatively smoked.</p>

<p>"It looks flat here, but it isn't," he remarked, his eyes
roving round the plain. "What a lot of buffalo bones!"</p>

<p>There were, indeed, a lot of buffalo bones. White ribs showed
like the ribs of small boats. A skull in the long grass by the
water's edge regarded them with a hollow stare. There were many
bones there, some glinting like ivory, some powdery and bleached
to the hue of lime.</p>

<p>Talkative, Atkins changed his pose, lay out on the grass, head
propped on an elbow, watching the horses graze and bob in their
hobbles.</p>

<p>"They always make me think of men in a three-legged race,"
said he.</p>

<p>Angus replied with a little laugh at the simile.</p>

<p>"I like to see the Redcoats at Fort Calgarry," Gus continued,
"training their horses to stand what they may have to get when
going into an Indian village to make an arrest--one or two
mounted and others whooping and waving blankets at them. First
time I saw that, and heard the shouts, I thought it was a
mutiny--and then I noticed they were all laughing, and tumbled to
it. I sometimes think I would like to join the force." He sat up.
"Here are some of these Crees back. You know their lingo, I
suppose, living up in their country so long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Ask them if the Bloods have come." The young Indians, on the
last lap home, rode wildly to make a spectacular return, all
ki-yi-ing together. A fancy took them to swoop round the slough
past the traders' horses and Angus's. They were in high spirits,
and though they laughed as they circled the little lake, yelling,
there was something of challenge in their eyes.</p>

<p>Angus noted it, but considered that there were rowdies
everywhere. In Edinburgh there were street gamins, in Glasgow
there were the <i>keelies</i> who would, feeling lively, jostle
one of their number against a passerby and impudently await
results.</p>

<p>He stood up. Some of the quirting hobbledehoys grinned, others
glowered at him. Was the white man annoyed at the risk of a
stampede of his hobbled horses? How would he take their fun?</p>

<p>He called to them in Cree: "Have the Kainu come?"</p>

<p>At once their manner changed. They reined in. To talk sign
language is an aid; to talk the language of the Indian with whom
one would converse is a stronger tie.</p>

<p>No. The Bloods had not arrived.</p>

<p>Angus's gaze was sharp on the rein-hand of the one who spoke,
a stripling in his early teens. There was a collet ring upon it,
the sight of which gave him a clutch at the heart, took his
thoughts to Minota at Mountain House.</p>

<p>"That is a pretty ring," said he.</p>

<p>The lad changed the lines to the other hand, wheeled and rode
away--the others at once following him with a rub-a-dub of hoofs,
yelping like coyotes. They coasted the slough back to their own
camp.</p>

<p>The abstraction of the foreman was thereafter so deep and so
unremitting--with only a nod or a grunt, if that, to the chatter
of his assistant--that at last Gus rose.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a ride over to the cut-banks and see if the
Bloods are in sight yet," said he.</p>

<p>Angus made no reply, watched apparently, but only apparently
seeing, Gus bridle his horse, fold and smooth the blanket, and
with a swing of his arms toss the saddle in place.</p>

<p>"See you later then, boss."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, yes, all right. All right!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c18">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>A Collet Ring</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Angus sat alone, remembering Minota. He heard her voice.
Again, at an impulse to expel sadness and doubt from her eyes, he
put on her hand the ring of his forebears and knew her fealty, a
fealty so deep that the humility of it hurt.</p>

<p>That ring: How had the Cree boy come by it? Gruesome stories
he had heard during the Great Sickness of roving parties,
ignorant of the contagious quality of the disease, looting,
ghoul-like, in tattered camps of the dead. So, no doubt, it was
when the lesser sickness--that was almost as virulent to these
people--passed through the land.</p>

<p>Of course, he told himself, there are many collet rings. Yet
that one, he could all but have sworn, was of his people--his,
Minota's. He must see it again, and if it was the one he
suspected he might hear more of the end of Red Shield's band than
anyone at Fort Edmonton or the Rocky Mountain House had been able
to tell him. He must see that ring again for closer scrutiny. If
it was the one he could all but swear it was he would offer to
trade for it.</p>

<p>He rose, and with a manner as of casual visitor, to hide the
determination that was urgent in him, he strolled round the
rush-edged slough to the Indian camp. Dogs, as he drew near, came
snarling to meet him. He walked slowly among them with a wary eye
over his shoulder on those that sneaked behind him, beadily
considering his heels. As he passed the first lodge there came a
hiss from its entrance (white men hiss dogs on; Indians hiss them
off) and an old squaw emerged, stick in hand. The dogs retired,
and Angus nodded his gratitude.</p>

<p>Some youths playing Follow-My-Leader through the camp saw him.
The leader dashed forward, made a motion with a wand he
carried--the motion of counting <i>coup</i>--against his
shoulder. He smiled amiably to a succession of taps from the
followers. But an old man sitting at a tepee door further on rose
and peremptorily shouted to the boys, telling them to treat a
visitor more civilly. Clearly he was one having authority. Those
at the end of the string did not administer the flick with the
wands they carried. "They are young," said Angus in Cree. Hearing
his own tongue the patriarch told his caller to be seated, moving
a little sideways on a robe by the tepee where he was sunning his
aged bones. Where had Angus come from? Where had he learnt to
talk Cree? What was his age? So went the questions. Always they
wanted to know one's age! Angus wondered why. And you? he asked
in return. <i>Seventy snows.</i> Munro made the usual reply, "You
do not look it," and received the wonted little laugh.</p>

<p>The approach would have been slower, strategic, had it not
happened that hardly was he seated when the wearer of the ring
rode to the lodge, dismounted, dropping the reins to the earth,
and passed inside.</p>

<p>"That is a good-looking lad," said Angus.</p>

<p>"My son."</p>

<p>His son, and he was seventy! He must have a young wife.</p>

<p>"That is a pretty ring he has on."</p>

<p>"I will ask him to show it to you," and the old man called to
the boy, "All Alone--come! Show this white man the ring you
have."</p>

<p>"He has seen it already," replied All Alone, dipping out of
the tepee.</p>

<p>"I want to see it close," Angus explained. Diffidently the
youth took it off, doubtfully renounced it to the extended palm
and watched, somewhat glum, while Angus turned it over and looked
within its hoop. Yes, it was the ring he had given Minota. To
offer to trade for it, however, while he held it, that expression
on the lad's face, would never do. There would probably be a
snatching of it away. So he handed it back lightly.</p>

<p>"A pretty ring," he said.</p>

<p>All Alone put it on again and stood, Indian fashion, without a
word, hip-shot, considering this white stranger who had not,
after all, wanted to trade for his ring as he had feared, only to
look at it. A few moments later he moved away, mounted his horse
and rode off.</p>

<p>"What band of Crees is this?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"The band of Buffalo Calf. I am Buffalo Calf."</p>

<p>"My name is Angus Munro."</p>

<p>Buffalo Calf nodded and his brows puckered as he tried to say
it to himself. Then he bethought him of some appropriate English
he knew and spoke it slowly.</p>

<p>"I am--pleased--to--met--you," said he, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>The salutation over, he seemed to retire into himself, elbow
on thigh, hand cupped to pipe-bowl, puffing smoke
deliberately.</p>

<p>"That is a nice boy," remarked Angus.</p>

<p>"What boy?" and the chief glanced left and right.</p>

<p>"Your son."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I knew many Crees when I was at Fort Edmonton, and met others
sometimes when I was at the Mountain House." said Angus. "I never
saw you there."</p>

<p>"I always traded at Fort Carlton or Fort Pitt."</p>

<p>Angus nodded and sat silent while the old man examined
him--and liked him. He decided to have this white visitor's
opinion upon a matter that puzzled him.</p>

<p>"Do you think," he began, coming abruptly to the point, "that
there is any sign that would bring the old days back?"</p>

<p>Angus had not listened to Minota for nothing. He understood.
This was normal, not fantastic.</p>

<p>"I think the past can never come back," said he.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Buffalo Calf. "Sometimes I go and sit on a
cliff over which our people used to drive the buffalo long ago,
even before we had ears." (Before, that is to say, any definite
history). "I sit there and wonder if I could find a sign to bring
the past back again--the far past before the Great Sickness,
before the white man came. There have always been white men in my
time but too many come now. I am not happy about this. I used to
think, so many buffalo they kill and take away the beef and the
robes, that they must be either very poor or very many. Now so
many come that I think your people cannot always be born like us,
of woman. I think many of you must be born from leaves of trees.
A wind blows in autumn; the leaves fall--and they rise up white
men. But, perhaps, there is a medicine sign that would send them
away. Too many come. I think, perhaps, some day I may find that
sign," he went on, moving his hands in air, "and when I make it
the buffalo will be here--many, not few--and all the white men's
forts and lodges of wood will be gone."</p>

<p>There seemed no hatred of the white man to whom he divulged
this idea, this hope. He spoke in a frank
na&iuml;vet&eacute;.</p>

<p>Angus looked at him sadly. Minota had views touched with a
similar simplicity.</p>

<p>"Do you think it is true, what I hear?" asked the chief. "Is
it true that before long all the land here will be covered with
white men?"</p>

<p>"It may be."</p>

<p>"I have heard from some Assiniboines who have been far south
that the white men there--the Long Knives" (cavalry sabres) "have
a wagon that goes by fire and pulls other wagons full of white
men, and every day they go along. I have heard that a fire-wagon
is to come to these plains. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have heard that," said Angus.</p>

<p>"Do you think that when the white men are all over our country
we shall die?" inquired Buffalo Calf. His tone, however, less
suggested that he thought so than that, if Angus held such a
view, he would dispute it.</p>

<p>"No," replied Angus, "not if you look after your cattle. Not
if you plough and sow."</p>

<p>"We shall not die!" exclaimed the old man. "I shall tell you
why. Indian blood is strong. One drop of Indian blood is stronger
than a hundred drops of white man's blood. I have seen it."</p>

<p>"You have seen it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have seen children of a white man and an Indian
woman--and they were all Indian. The white man's blood was weak.
More than that. I have seen white people here who were Indian to
look at."</p>

<p>"I've seen that, too," Angus admitted, recalling some men at
Fort Calgarry who were unquestionably of white parentage yet very
like the Indians, "but I think it is just because they have to
breathe as your people do the air of these big prairies. It
shapes their noses. It makes their chests," he drew deep breaths
in explanation, "like yours. They pucker their eyes to the sun on
snow, and to the brightness of the summer sky, and their eyes
become like yours. The sun makes their faces dark like
yours."</p>

<p>"It may be so," said Buffalo Calf, as one considering an
opinion new to him, "but I do not think it is that. I have
thought it is because all this is Indian country and it turns
even white men to Indians in time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Angus, for pity's sake, feeling again as he
had felt on seeing Crowfoot--as often he had felt living with
Minota--that the general acceptation of the word <i>savage</i> is
misleading. These were but folk out of an earlier epoch. They had
minds. They could reason--but they were of the stone age. The age
of steel, of knives bearing on their blades the legend
<i>Sheffield, England,</i> was puzzling to them.</p>

<p>"I am an old man," said Buffalo Calf. "My father remembered
when there were no Red River carts coming across the plains here
to carry away the robes and the meat. My woman's father
remembered also. She is sixty-five."</p>

<p>"How do you have a son of sixteen years?" Angus asked. "Have
you a second, and younger, woman?"</p>

<p>"No. I made him my son," replied Buffalo Calf. "Sixteen snows
back we came on a camp of our people where all were dead of a
sickness like the Great Sickness, but that did not leave the
bodies so bad. He was in a tepee beside his mother. They were all
dead except that papoose. I took him. I made him my son. I called
him All Alone." (Angus sat cross-legged, pipe gone out, staring
at this savage--this neolithic man born too late). "I said, 'I
will make this boy my son,' for my two true sons had been killed
by the Blackfeet when going to steal horses from them."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I gave him to one of our women to suckle. I took the ring
that was on the mother's finger and kept it till he was fifteen
snows. Then I gave it to him."</p>

<p>Angus's hand was trembling, holding the pipe on his knee. How
was he to know more? He had not expected this! The old man who
talked might suddenly, with his views, being what he was, become
silent.</p>

<p>"Do you think he is a true Indian?" he inquired in a voice he
scarcely recognized as his own.</p>

<p>There were times when these people were to Angus more as a
dark-hued peasantry, a genial, laughing peasantry, than
barbarians. But at this point the face beside him changed. The
expression altered so that it seemed the very contours altered
also. It was as if the eyes drew closer. There was actually that
effect as of a profile even in full face. Here was the savage, as
the word is generally understood, his eyes glittering like a
cougar's.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he shouted, and in his vehemence accentuated it by the
affirmative sign. Then he pointed at Angus. "I took her things. I
took the things in her tepee. I did not know they would carry
that sickness as the Great Sickness is carried. They did. Many of
our band died afterwards. The white men at Fort Pitt told me it
was because I had taken these things."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, no doubt. But how do you know he is all
Indian?"</p>

<p>"Because the Indian blood is strong--though his father was a
white man."</p>

<p>"His father was a white man!"</p>

<p>"Yes. There was a letter"--he made the sign for
writing--"among her things. I asked the factor at Fort Pitt to
speak it to me. He thought it should be burnt because it carried
the little Great Sickness. I thought it good to do so--to wipe
all out. It was from her white man to say that though he was far
away he thought of her and would come back. They all say
that."</p>

<p>"He may not have known she had a son. It may have come after
he went away."</p>

<p>"Could he not have seen her belly?"</p>

<p>"He may have gone before it showed."</p>

<p>The look of rage died on the face of Buffalo Calf.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it is possible."</p>

<p>Very Indian was he then, thought Angus, having had experience
of their willingness to reason a matter--and condone.</p>

<p>"Yes, it may be so," agreed Buffalo Calf, and fluttered a hand
before him in the sign for uncertainty.</p>

<p>"The white man wrote to her," Angus went on, still in that
voice he hardly knew. "When white men leave their Indian women
not to come back they do not write."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Buffalo Calf, knocking out the ashes of
his pipe, and pulling the chokecherry stem from the bowl he put
both in a deerskin sack.</p>

<p>"The man may not have known before he left," repeated Angus.
"He may not have known."</p>

<p>The thought came to him: <i>Did Minota know?</i> Did she
withhold the word from him because of his wish to go with Sam to
the land of his people? His brows puckered as he tried to make a
calculation of the time of his leaving her and the time of the
little Great Sickness. No, she would not know till some weeks
after he had gone. What would her thought be then, waiting for
him with her people?</p>

<p>A little wind sighed in the grass and the rushes of the lake's
edge tattled together. He looked up to find Buffalo Calf's eyes
on him.</p>

<p>"You looked as if you died a little while," said the old man
in their phrase for deepest reveries, a <i>dwam,</i> fainting.
"The Indian blood is strong. That man would not know his own son
if he came back."</p>

<p>"Have you told All Alone his father was--a white man?" Angus's
voice sounded then as though he spoke in an empty room.</p>

<p>"He knows that he is my adopted son but I have not told him
that his father was a white man. That might make him ashamed. I
grow old. My true sons are dead. This son I will leave. There, he
comes now. Is he not an Indian boy? Look at him again. I do not
know why I have told you all this. Perhaps because of the way you
give your ears. Even if I cannot make a medicine sign and bring
back the buffalo of old, and put all the white men away, I think
that in time all men on these Great Plains will be true Indians.
He comes. You will not speak? Have pity."</p>

<p>"No, I will not speak."</p>

<p>"Swear! Touch the earth, point to the sky. You know my people.
You know the oath. Swear!"</p>

<p>Angus rose. He lifted a hand to point to that tremendous sky
but at the moment the lad came close and he changed the sign. He
lifted both hands in air and slowly lowered them in the sign of
blessing, and a haze was in his eyes, blinding them.</p>

<p>Buffalo Calf, looking on, was content. This man, he thought,
was one of the good whites. All Alone might have been startled
had he seen the sign of taking an oath and have pestered with
questions. The blessing would suffice. The white man was going,
and in going made that sign--that was all.</p>

<p>To his camp-place Angus walked back round the slough, hardly
noticing that the traders to south of it were no longer there,
had moved while, over at the village, he had talked with Buffalo
Calf. He sat down. How long he sat he did not know.</p>

<p>Out of a clear sky to west little clouds magically appeared, a
row of them--as from the Arctic to Mexico, so high--white clouds
that turned to red, that turned to gold, that turned to a file of
tenuous flames, the sun setting behind the distant Rockies: but
of these displays of Nature he was unaware.</p>

<p>He had a son, an Indian son, all Indian--all Indian! What
could he do about this? What should he do? He started as a horse
came close and Gus dismounted, whistling a snatch of a waltz that
Strauss, visiting New York the year before with his orchestra,
had let loose to be hummed and whistled across the continent.
Angus looked up.</p>

<p>"The Bloods have come," said Gus.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Did you not hear them?"</p>

<p>"Hear them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought you would hear them as far as this. They came
singing--singing in from south. You missed something, sticking
around here. I wouldn't have missed it for worlds. Came singing,
all feathered, their bonnets swaying, over the edges of the
cut-bank south. That was a sight."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>All that evening S. D.'s foreman, thought Gus, was as a man
<i>sickening for something</i>, or one who had heard of a death.
That was the only way he could describe Angus's melancholy
abstraction. He could not get a word out of him.</p>

<p>For long Angus lay awake, thinking, thinking, under the
eternal sweep of the Milky Way, the <i>Ghost Trail.</i> At last
his eyes closed, and when he awoke in the morning the camp of the
Crees to the east end of that lakelet was gone. The rushes, the
border grass, and the sky-mirroring water had an aspect of entire
possession of the morning's light.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c19">CHAPTER NINETEEN</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Prairie Schooner</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Somewhat as Angus had noticed, when rejoining Sam at Fort
Calgarry, that his old friend <i>looked his age</i>, did Sam in
the days following his foreman's return from Blackfoot Crossing,
see him as one changed. He wondered if Munro had received a
letter containing ill news--perhaps from those Red River
Settlement friends of his. Not that he went about his duties with
the aspect of one cherishing melancholy. Not at all. In fact, the
indication as of a private trouble came, partly, from a new sort
of cheerfulness he dispensed, that seemed forced instead of
spontaneous.</p>

<p>Angus did not, however, long permit his secret to be like
blinds down at windows. He had mastered, so far as outward signs
were concerned, save to the shrewdest eyes, that dolour which
made Gus think--out yonder on the plains--that he must be
<i>sickening for something</i>, or that the way to describe his
condition was to say that one might have suspected he had had
news of a death. Gus had found him cheery companion as ever,
riding home. Still, such was Sam Douglas's impression.</p>

<p>But Sam had his own worries--of another sort. Rumour was
flying that the railway was not, after all, to come their way,
but to go swinging northwest from the Red River by that splashing
of forts--Ellice, Pelly, Pitt, Carlton, Edmonton--and on through
the Yellow Head Pass.</p>

<p>"Where," demanded Sam Douglas of Angus, as though he could
change all that, "are the cattlemen who are coming in here to
ship their steers if they slither that railroad away up there
into the Arctic Circle?"</p>

<p>Angus chuckled at the extravagance.</p>

<p>"Laugh? It's no laughing matter for those like myself who have
assured people that here was going to be the great
cattle-shipping centre. They will have to drive them these
millions of miles" (Angus restrained another chuckle) "over the
border to ship. I think I'll have to go in for politics to see we
get what we need here. Taking the railway up there to Hellangone!
Well, we'll have a smoke."</p>

<p>Yet a little while--during which Douglas went about cloudy of
brow--and all was well again.</p>

<p>"Heard the news?" he inquired, coming into the office,
carrying two travelling bags, a robe flung over a shoulder. There
was a twist to his grim mouth, an upward twist to one side, of
gaiety.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The railway company that has taken over from the government
has changed the route. I suppose they've been looking up the old
reports of Palliser and seen that he vetoed not only this route
but all--on grounds of finance, no immediate advantage
commensurate with the required sacrifice of capital was what his
report said. I mind the words well for I thought--"</p>

<p>"That he didn't jump far enough ahead?"</p>

<p>"Quite! And he affixed Hector's report telling that there were
easy gradients this way once they got to the west slopes. Rogers
now, I hear, is of the same mind as Moberly was these twenty
years ago--how time flies! And I've just had a letter that says
Sandford Fleming plumps for the Kicking Horse Pass. Have a
cigar?"</p>

<p>There was the swaying yoked trudge past the door of a string
of bullocks, the shadow of the wagon they hauled moving across
the floor, the scliff of another span behind. Angus went out to
see that all was in order for departure of the train to Benton
and Sam followed, stepping into the group of bull-whackers that
clustered round the foreman.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, have a cigar," said he.</p>

<p>"Is this just a smoke or a celebration, Sam?" asked one of the
men.</p>

<p>"The railway is coming this way," Sam told him. He struck a
match on his leg, held the flame for them to light up. "I'll just
get my things into one of the wagons. I'm coming with you."</p>

<p>"You are going to Fort Benton?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes--and on. You can do all I can do here till I get
back."</p>

<p>So at last he went down the Benton trail--in safety.</p>

<p>It was two years before he returned, and during these two
years many people came to Calgary. A second hotel was built to
house the arrivals. Angus recalled Buffalo Calf's complaint, "Too
many people come." Thought of Buffalo Calf cast his thoughts
darkly into the past. If only he had known! If only he had
followed that impulse that warred against his departure (which
was of his own volition), these years ago, from Rocky Mountain
House. Minota's son, his son, could have been educated as the
sons of these old Company men, who took their women east with
them, were educated. Too late . . .</p>

<p>Up from Nebraska, up from Kansas, came whole families, father,
mother, daughters in the wagons, sons driving the cattle and
horse herds alongside. One of these middle-aged immigrants told
Angus that when he was a lad he had left his Ohio home for Kansas
but--</p>

<p>"It's getting too danged crowded there," said he, "so we
thought we'd move where there was room, and all got into this
here prairie schooner."</p>

<p><i>Prairie schooner:</i> it was a good word. He remembered his
first crossing of the plains with Aloysius and Pierre, and how
they spoke, on its flat stretches, of being <i>out of sight of
land.</i> Still was the impression, on these seas of grass, of
marine adventure.</p>

<p>The prairie schooners came rocking, lurching, over the long
rolls, their canvas hoods to be seen twinkling like the sails of
a ship at sea. Frequent were occasions, incidents, that made
Angus think of his son. There came to Calgary a land surveyor in
government service who was, he discovered, a full-blood Oneida
Indian from Ontario (Upper Canada of old); a man of the most
pleasing manners, quiet-spoken and full of character. True, that
was an Indian of the east where for generations the natives had
been in touch with the whites. But he met also a half-breed civil
engineer, son of a Scots father and a Saulteaux woman, these
retired in Winnipeg, who made him again abstracted in the eyes of
others for awhile, he thinking of All Alone, <i>all Indian.</i>
How old now? In his late teens. Too late . . . But some day, when
Sam came back, Angus decided he would take a month off, go to the
Buffalo Calf reserve, and see the chief and All Alone--though
what good, he asked himself, would that do? Well, he could at
least see if all went well with the lad.</p>

<p>The seasons toned one into the other. The Rockies were
obliterated in rain. Any newcomer would have to take them on
faith. The sky dropped a curtain halfway toward them, a quaking
gray curtain. Dust rose no longer from pattering hoofs and
rolling wheels. The hoofs squelched; the wagons laboured and
sometimes slowly subsided in mud to the hubs. Snow came and then
a morning when the mountains glittered in the west, utterly white
save where some gable of rock was too precipitous even for the
wind of blizzard to plaster its face. At evening the white
changed to gold and pink, to blood-red, to purple. Runners took
the place of wheels on the carts. A Chinook wind blew from west
and the snow soon turned to slush. Frost came and the oozy ruts,
with the hummock between, hardened. Wagons were sorely tried with
joltings in and out of these rigid grooves. Spring came and mire
again, mire quickly dried in the hot sun. Hoofs sputtered dust,
wagons trailed dust.</p>

<p>Back came Sam Douglas, but not by Fort Benton as he had gone,
came from railhead--which was halfway across Assiniboia. The
basis of Sam's fortune had been laid while he was away, he calmly
buying and selling town lots in the hectically buying and selling
"city" of Winnipeg, with no financial aid from any and on behalf
of none (he had given them their chance long ago), merely with
his own savings and for his own hand. Back in Calgary--they had
dropped the <i>Fort</i> and were beginning to spell it with one
r, accentuating the first syllable--a new sign appeared over the
door of a new building, one not of logs but of whip-saw lumber:
<i>S. Lovat Douglas, Real Estate.</i></p>

<p>Sam thought not only of himself.</p>

<p>"If you have a sock under your bed, Angus," said he one day,
"with any savings in it, say the word if you'd like me to treble
it for you--and with no commission, just for auld time's
sake."</p>

<p>Angus Munro, on the spot, however, was as timid, it seemed to
Sam, as those in distance who had disappointed him years
previously. To him his friend showed lack of faith, content with
quick sales and then a dubious retreat. The men to whom Douglas
sold for him seemed, to Angus's mind, to be saddled--at the
prices they paid--with lots that never could they sell again,
only pay taxes on! Yes, Angus, in Sam's mind, fell away to a mere
ordinary man fit for no more than the management of a livery
stable.</p>

<p>There came a day when Angus was thinking much of the Frasers,
could not have got them out of his mind had he wanted to. He had
not heard from them for a long while. In Fiona's last letter he
had been told of Flora's marriage and, reading, recalled her as
first he saw her, a mere tot of plump wonder. She had married a
descendant of one of those Swiss that the Earl of Selkirk had
brought to Red River as a protective military force for the
Selkirk and Kildonan settlers. To that letter he had replied.
Later he had written again; then silence.</p>

<p>So much were they in his mind that he dismissed the notion
that a correspondence should be equally balanced, ding-dong. It
was usually Fiona who wrote for the family. What, he asked
himself, made him think so much of them all? He remembered the
<i>freits</i>, the omens of his mother. He would write that very
day--and had just made the resolve when Gus Atkins entered,
greatly amused. He had what he thought of as rich humour to
communicate, without malice. All day he had been driving for Sam
a capacious rig full of <i>landlookers.</i> These, considered
Angus as he listened, had been easier to deal with than the folk
in Glasgow and Edinburgh when Douglas tried to awaken enthusiasm
for western investment in the Auld Country, easier to deal with
by the fact that they brought enthusiasm, even travelling ahead
of steel at its urge.</p>

<p>It was the extent of the Great Metropolis of the West, as seen
by his employer, that amused Gus Atkins.</p>

<p>"Does he really believe it all?" he asked, sitting on the
table, hugging his knees and laughing a resum&eacute; of the
prophesies of Sam Lovat Douglas.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's genuine," said Angus.</p>

<p>"Well! Calgary is going to stretch, according to him, halfway
south to Fort Macleod, halfway north to the Mountain House, and
bang up west to the Rockies. 'Now here,'" and he imitated Sam's
voice, "'here's the ideal site for a fire-hall. Here's a whole
stretch of lots I have on my books but I can't let you in on
that. I've a man considering the purchase of the whole caboodle
for a stadium and I passed him my word I would give him two-three
days to consider the matter.'--'Here's a fine site I often think
for a town hall. Can't you see the grand situation?'--'We'll
drive through the future residential area now, or a part of it.
We can't cover it all in a day.' He's a mesmerist! I was nearly
mesmerized myself. If I hadn't those peppy horses to handle I'd
have been seeing mansions of the Calgary-to-be rising in
porcupine meadows and prairie-dog pastures. You really think he
is genuine?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed, Gus."</p>

<p>"Why don't you buy more, then?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm not such an optimist, that's all."</p>

<p>A prairie schooner rolled past the door, another, astern,
halted there with a swaying of whiffle-tree and a jingle of
chain. Some pilgrim wanting a repair or a direction to the
government post, no doubt, thought Angus.</p>

<p>As he looked, a young woman swung out from the seat in an
agile movement to the hub, the ground, and stepped in at the
door--a tall girl, over her dress a long buckskin coat, on her
hands fringed driving gauntlets. He had risen as she entered. Gus
slid from the table to attention. She advanced, drawing off a
glove and revealing a shapely hand.</p>

<p>Angus stared at her.</p>

<p>"Fiona!" he cried out. "Fiona, my dear!"</p>

<p>"See you later," said Gus Atkins.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c20">CHAPTER TWENTY</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Fiona</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Angus took her hands. He held them, incredulous, first, of
this descent upon him and amazed, secondly, at the manner in
which she had as it were made up on him. She let him hold her,
canted back, laughing happily at his astonishment--and clear
admiration. She was like morning in that long low-ceilinged room
to him.</p>

<p>How long they remained so he did not know. Thought, no doubt,
was lightning-quick then: this tall girl, this woman--the child
whose lessons he had <i>hearkened</i>, the child of "Thus spake
the sheriff . . ." it seemed impossible. To that earliest memory
of her--he sixteen, she not six--even more than to later ones (he
twenty, she nine, or he going west again and she but a lass in
her teens to his young manliness) his mind returned.</p>

<p>"But what does it mean?" he began.</p>

<p>"Come and see."</p>

<p>He relinquished her hands, and as they walked out there was a
feeling in him as though his deepmost being strangely passed
beyond the confines of the body and merged with hers. Was she
aware of it, too? he wondered. The emotion was as one they must
share.</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser was clambering down from the first tilted wagon as
they came outside, and his greeting was a hearty, chesty laugh at
the expression on Angus's face. Mrs. Fraser was still in the
wagon from which Fiona had alighted, craning from the hooped open
front of the tilt to see him and stretch a hand to him.</p>

<p>"But what does it mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can see," replied Fraser. "And all the family unanimous,
whatever."</p>

<p>"Where is Hector?"</p>

<p>"Back there with the horses. We brought no cattle, for it is
the long-horned steers here, and--"</p>

<p>"You are--"</p>

<p>"Beginning afresh. And you needn't say I'm either crazy or too
old, for I've seen others a lot older than me at the game as we
crawled along here upon our way. Come and meet Mrs. Hector. She's
in the wagon I'm driving."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hector?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Hector Fraser. Hector decided to get married before
we started."</p>

<p>But the horses that Hector was guarding chose that moment to
come milling towards them. Angus hauled away the bars of the big
pole-corral.</p>

<p>"Herd them in here," he shouted.</p>

<p>The quality of a dream remained, was indeed accentuated when,
an hour later, they all sat down together in one of the three
(there were three by that time) hotels of hammering Calgary.</p>

<p>"It's like a dream," Angus told them.</p>

<p>"It has been like a dream," said Fiona. "I'll never forget the
dawns on the prairie," and then suddenly was shy by her own
remark.</p>

<p>"We saw lots of antelope," remarked Hector. "Didn't we,
Mohra?" to his young wife. "It must have been a sight when there
were buffalo also. We saw their wallows all the way across, and
their trails--and, their bones. We saw a prairie fire far off,
and the wind was not coming our way by good luck."</p>

<p>"A mounted policeman," said Mrs. Fraser, "told us that these
fires are mostly started by bottles, broken bottles and the sun
shining through them making them like burning glasses."</p>

<p>"He said," added Ian, "that the chief export of this country
might be broken bottles for awhile to come."</p>

<p>Sitting there at meat with them, Angus had a memory of St.
Cloud close on twenty-four years earlier, wondered why, and then
realized. It was the waitresses who rolled back time for
him--these four reigning queens among the tables. There were no
written bills-of-fare. They stood stately beside the diners and,
with heads erect and eyelids supercilious, recited the menu. The
hush in the room was as in deference to them. Dido and Helen,
Semiramis and Cleopatra condescended to the muted guests, setting
plates before them and icily demanding, "What do you drink--tea
or coffee?" St. Cloud, Minnesota, his father and mother and he
waiting for the stage to start out for Abercrombie on the Red
River, and his mother with a little dip of her head, an elevation
of her brows, whispering, "Are we not the grand hussies,
whatever?" a twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>There followed on that memory a sense of having other kindred
in the world still as well as that son lost to him, <i>all
Indian.</i> True the Frasers were but <i>forty-second
cousins</i>, but they were his and he was theirs,
<i>whatever!</i> Sentiment was alive in him, if not indeed
sentimentality. Let it go as <i>sensibility</i> as still, in
those days, the word was used.</p>

<p>He sat back and looked at Fiona and had a thought he could
tell to none: Some drops of the same blood that coursed in his
veins was in hers, and so thinking he had again that emotion of
strange contact with her that he had experienced when stepping
out of the office to greet the others. Fiona met his eyes and
first a haze was in the pools of hers, then through that haze she
smiled.</p>

<p>One of the great queens of that room bent over Mrs. Fraser in
a descent from her high estate.</p>

<p>"Well, folks," she inquired, "was everything all right?"</p>

<p>The Frasers were all startled by the change.</p>

<p>"Just splendid," replied Mrs. Fraser, and, as the lady
lingered: "This is the first time we have been in a hotel since
we left home."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Red River Settlement--near Winnipeg."</p>

<p>But at that moment another party arrived and the queen who had
called them <i>folks</i> departed, taking on regality again. The
Frasers passed out of that hotel in Calgary--and Angus from the
hotel in St. Cloud! He carried them off to visit Sam Douglas in
the real estate office.</p>

<p>"The best move you could ever have made," declared Sam. Here
were people--here was a family--to his mind, folk of wisdom and
faith. "Aye, we'll get you a location. We'll take them in hand,
Angus."</p>

<p>He explained that he could easily spare the time off to make
an unhurried, leisurely search for the right spot. He deserved,
he considered, some little celebration of rest and
recreation.</p>

<p>"I have the very place for you in my mind," he said. "Spitsee
Country, ye ken, Angus," he threw out the aside and turned again
to the Frasers. "I've ridden that way once or twice and always
I've thought, <i>There's the place for the perfect ranch
house.</i> There's a creek trotting along round the bases of the
low hills, a real wee burn. There's timber handy for the
building. You are right in the lush range country, too. Angus,
we'll both knock off a few days and see to this."</p>

<p>They saw many locations during the next weeks but in the end
the one the Frasers chose was the one that Sam spoke of on first
hearing of their intention to settle in that west. It was a vast
land--and there were no motor cars in those days to whirl them on
their way. The best part of a month was gone when the decision
was made.</p>

<p>The rolling hills that day were of the tone of coyote pelts.
As they dipped through coulees they saw the yellow tufts of
sage-brush against blue. As they crested the rolls they saw the
higher ones beyond crowned with stands of trees so that each
mound looked like a great bristling porcupine. Backward there
were vistas up long retiring valleys, from the edges of which the
mountains rose abruptly. The trotting of the little brooks--the
<i>wee burns</i>--round and about the bases of the tawny hummocks
was very pleasing to eyes and ears.</p>

<p>They began to talk of the railway, Sam, no doubt, setting the
theme. While they were on their way west, they told him, the
railway had already passed Medicine Hat where, said legend, a
Blackfoot chief saw the headgear of a medicine man rise from the
waters, and then the head a moment--in some omen, perhaps, such
as Mrs. Munro might have been able to comprehend. There they had
talked to Mr. Ross--Mr. James Ross--a Highland engineer and,
further on, to an enormous man who was overseeing the actual
track-laying, one Donald Grant by name, from Glengarry--in
Scotland. He had beaten the thrusting record, at eight miles a
day, and hoped to beat his own record again.</p>

<p>They were actually in the midst of that talk when they came to
a crest, on the shoulder of which the Spitsee trail dipped aslant
toward the big coulee near Calgary. From there they had a vision
of the plain as from a coast range one looks out to sea. There
was a flash yonder, a flash, a gleam, drawing their attention.
There was more: two silver wires lay on the prairie tapering away
to one in perspective. The railway, in their absence, had come
closer.</p>

<p>Sam led Ian Fraser to the government post to introduce him (as
"an old friend o' mine") to the government agent and recorder.
Hector, Mrs. Hector and Mrs. Fraser had been dropped at the
hotel. Fiona and Angus remained outside. They could see from
there the <i>S. D. Transport and Haulage</i> stables.</p>

<p>"There's a whole string of pack ponies," said Fiona suddenly,
"gone loping into your barn and no rider with them. There must
have been an accident!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," Angus replied, having observed them also.
"There would be no rider with them. People hire them to pack
stuff out to their places and they come back alone to the
stables."</p>

<p>"I love it! I love this country!" she exclaimed
impetuously.</p>

<p>It came to his mind that he had intended, some day, to take a
month off and go to the reservation of Buffalo Calf and see how
all went with his son--Minota's son. All Alone. When he was
seventeen and Fiona but six, little did he dream of this day, she
a woman grown, moving him to the deeps of his being by her mere
presence beside him, by the tones of her voice--as at that
moment.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c21">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>VOILA LES BOEUFS!</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Frasers were building their new home at the chosen
location in the Spitsee River country--as the whites pronounced
<i>Is-pit-si</i>, which, being interpreted, means High Woods. A
little later it would be called Highwood River; a little later
still, High River, and few would be curious to ask and only a few
old men would be able to tell whence the name.</p>

<p>Angus was back at work.</p>

<p>"This place goes jumping ahead," said Sam, "and the railway
hasn't spoilt the transport and haulage business as some blind
prophets foretold. Quite the reverse. All the pack strings out on
the tote-road, the wagons rolling down the Benton road--if no
further, sometimes, than to Macleod--and up to Edmonton. I see
another kirk-steeple rising, though the Anglicans are still
holding their services in the mounted police orderly room; and
there's a wheen red lights of the Scarlet Women in their shacks
down by the railway. Yes, we will let the natives see what
civilization means," and he chuckled in his chest.</p>

<p>It was at that time, when Angus was still busy over arrears of
bookkeeping, that there came to Calgary one who was to--well,
there came to Calgary the Western Commissioner for the Department
of the Interior (Indian Affairs) at Ottawa. He wanted somebody to
drive him out to the Sareee and Stoney reserves, on a tour of
inspection. Angus would have liked to go but his month of
land-looking with the Frasers had left a clutter of arrears. So
the Commissioner was driven away by one who figured on the
payroll as Milk River Mike. (They had names like that on the
payrolls in those days.)</p>

<p>Sam had expected that his foreman would go with the
Commissioner, knowing as he did what he called Angus's <i>Indian
kink</i> and recalling, no doubt, that when the police force
wanted a pack string to supplement their transportation
facilities at the time of the great gathering at Blackfoot
Crossing, Angus had considered it expedient to go.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be off with that Indian Department man," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Too busy," replied Angus.</p>

<p>That answer set Douglas pondering.</p>

<p>"If I lost him," he considered to himself, "I would be hard
pressed to find one to take his place. I hope he doesn't get that
malady they call the <i>itching foot</i> some day--and up and
off." He drummed a tattoo on his desk, frowning over the thought
that it might be as well to take Angus into partnership. "No, I
would not like to lose him," he mused, but dismissed that for the
moment--and was to lose him before long.</p>

<p>For on the return of the Commissioner to Calgary he and Angus
had a long talk, the result of which was that six weeks later
Sam, looking up from his desk over at the real estate office to
see who came in, saw it was Angus who had ridden across from the
stables. Everybody rode then in Calgary if it was to go no
further than a hundred yards, hitching rails, or rings in posts,
before the doors, though many of the horses were trained to stand
with but dropped lines, <i>tied to the ground.</i> In Angus's
hand, as Sam noted on his entrance, was a letter,
governmental-looking.</p>

<p>"So you are leaving me," said he.</p>

<p>"How did you hear?" asked Angus, astonished--and in a way
relieved, for how to broach his errand had troubled him.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear. I jaloused. It's written on your forehead. Sit
down and tell me. Have a cigar--and tell me."</p>

<p>"I've an appointment as Indian Agent on the High Butte
reservation. The chief's name is Running Antelope."</p>

<p>"High Butte?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember it?"</p>

<p>"Do I remember it?" echoed Sam. "Do you think that though it's
the future I chiefly consider, I've no memory at all? Fine I
remember it and you riding up the slope for a last look at the
mountains. How many years ago is that?"</p>

<p>"It must be around twenty," said Angus. "The reservation
doesn't include the butte, but it's so called because that's the
nearest landmark."</p>

<p>"When do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"As soon as convenient. I'm to take over from a man there who
has been appointed to another reservation, in Assiniboia."</p>

<p>"Oh, well--you'll no doubt be Minister of the Department yet,
sitting in a braw office in Ottawa," Sam prophesied, and then he
lay back in his chair and laughed--laughed at the expression on
his foreman's face. "Oh, man Angus!" he exclaimed. "I can read
that on you, too. 'No thanks,' says you, 'I'd rather bide out
here.' By the way, that fellow Gus Atkins is leaving me, too.
He'll be over for his time from you. He's joining the mounted
police. Sojers' buttons, sojers' buttons--and the clink of the
spurs! There's no future in that for him I doubt, just a wee
pension if he lives to get it and isn't filled full of lead by
some whisky smuggler or cattle-stealing Indian. Sojers' buttons,
a Redcoat, and a hat like a pill-box on the side of the head
giving nae protection from the summer sun--a ridiculous
headpiece. They should have hats like the cowboys. Romance? There
is more romance in my life sitting here buying and selling
Canada--though I wear no red coat." He drummed his fingers on the
desk. "The Frasers will miss you," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll miss having them fairly close," said Angus.</p>

<p>"There was something else I was going to ask you--oh, yes:
have you two-three wagons not being used?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's fine. I'm giving a job to some of your Indian friends.
I have often, out on the plains, looked at that graveyard of
buffalo bones and wondered if there was no money in them. I've
discovered that there is. Not much. A little. I'm in touch with a
big sugar refinery business and it seems they buy bones."</p>

<p>"What on earth for?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea and it's not for me to inquire. They have use
for bones and will pay for them: that's all that interests me.
It's a mere side issue so far as the profits go. Och--it's a
charity! I've been talking to some Sarcees about it. You let them
have half a dozen wagons, they will provide the teams, and
they'll go out and shovel the bones up. I'll ship them away to
the sugar refinery. I'll send them over to you."</p>

<p>He sat back in his chair and played a tattoo again on his
desk, staring moodily at Angus, pondering some thought a long
while, then he seemed to dismiss whatever had been in his
mind.</p>

<p>"<i>Ye ken yer ain ken best, ye ken</i>, " said he. "After
all, you'll be more happy with yon Crees than you were with the
Ettrick brothers. Yon was a comic interlude in your life!
Godsakes, it's a funny thing, life! I sometimes think we live
several lives, some of us, not just one."</p>

<p>It was a thought not unfamiliar to Angus, a thought that again
he toyed with riding out on the Spitsee trail a week or two
later. For some distance he went by the Benton road, a broad
series of parallel ruts like a widely ploughed ribbon for border
of prairie and foothills. He met one of the <i>S. D.</i> bullock
trains rolling in and turned aside to avoid, as they used to say,
eating its dust. He made up on a wolfer journeying to some
sod-cabin of the plains, revolver on hip, rifle under the rope of
his diamond-hitched pack--one of those who made their living on
the sale of wolf pelts, with a bonus (cattlemen then in the land)
of bounty on each one slain.</p>

<p>"No more poisoning a carcase," the wolfer told him, "to get
them. The poison kills more than the wolves. Straight shooting
and trapping now. It was the Indians kicked first about the
poisoning game and I don't blame them."</p>

<p>"You get on with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, siree! Now and then I'll have a little party of them
come to my lonesome shack and try to throw a scare into me, for
devilment, but I got friends among them now--though, believe me,
I can stage a pretty good scare myself!"</p>

<p>He rode away to east and, perhaps in the change to lonesome
riding again, under that high September sky, began to sing <i>Red
River Shore.</i> The lilt of it stuck in Angus's mind. He was
humming it to himself when he came to the rise from which the new
Fraser home showed.</p>

<p>Ian and Hector, small figures, were making movements that
Munro knew to be of men digging post-holes. He saw Fiona and
Hector's wife appear beyond the house and begin to hang up
clothes on empty air--an odd effect of distance. A row of bunting
fluttered anon and the little figures were eclipsed by the
building.</p>

<p>There was a feeling among all that he had come on a special
errand. Sam Douglas was not the only thought-reader, or observer
of facial expression. Almost did Ian ask what brought him to them
that day, but to have done so would have suggested that Angus
might not come there except on a special errand. When he did
announce to them that he was leaving Sam to go into the service
of the Department of the Interior, Ian cried out: "I knew there
was something!" and felt self-gratulation on his
perceptivity.</p>

<p>Deeper was the perceptivity of Mrs. Fraser. She suspected that
he had come for more than to tell them that. <i>This man,</i> she
mused, <i>worships the ground Fiona treads on!</i> What, she
wondered, had kept him single so long? The lack, no doubt, of
white women in the land till but recently. What age was he? He
was over forty. "I'm a believer," she communed with herself, "in
the man being a bit older than the woman. Well, you never know
how things will go with the young. There was Flora, the baby,
married years ago--and by the last news soon to make me a
grandmother; and here is Fiona, single still, though she is a
lass any man might worship--whatever."</p>

<p>After the evening meal was finished, the dishes washed, they
went outside to the gable and sat there on a bench, all save
Hector, who preferred the top bar of the new pole-corral, the
high heels of his cowboy's shoes hooked to a lower one, he humped
up there in the fair and proper attitude of all good men of the
cattle ranges. They talked of this and that, of the news from
Flora, of the river-boat that had been built down at Coalbanks on
the Belly River for a Mr. Lethbridge, an Englishman, president of
the Northwest Coal and Navigation Company.</p>

<p>"A hundred and seventy-one feet long," Hector said,
"thirty-one feet broad, and with a draft of but a couple of
feet."</p>

<p>"I heard two and a half," said Ian.</p>

<p>"I heard two!"</p>

<p>They talked of the mine at Coalbanks and how Sir Alexander
Galt had had the idea to use the coal there to supply the
Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>

<p>"Mr. Douglas never went ahead with his notion of getting coal
out of the far nor'-west?" asked Ian.</p>

<p>"No. His interest is all town lots now, apart from the
transport business."</p>

<p>"It's a wonder nothing came of that other idea. Of course, it
needs capital. Perhaps he'll go ahead with it after all when the
country up there opens. I hear some folks have applied for leave
to build a railway from Coalbanks to Medicine Hat--"</p>

<p>"Narrow gauge," Hector stated from his lofty perch.</p>

<p>"Yes, narrow gauge. The boat is not very satisfactory at low
water."</p>

<p>"Douglas was speaking about that the other day," said Angus.
"It's Sir Alexander Galt, he tells me, who's at the back of that,
president of the steamship company. He's applying for a charter
for that line instead--narrow gauge," and he nodded up to Hector,
who grinned down at him. "You know who he is?"</p>

<p>"High Commissioner for Canada in Great Britain now, or
something like that they call him, isn't it?" replied Fraser.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I should have said, <i>Do you know who his father
was?</i> He's a son of the Galt of Irvine, you know, who wrote
<i>Annals of the Parish</i>."</p>

<p>"I've read that," said Fiona. "So that's who he is!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mr. Douglas will ever get a title. Sir Samuel
Lovat Douglas would sound fine," observed Mrs. Fraser.</p>

<p>"I don't think they should have titles in this country," said
Hector.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Mohra.</p>

<p>"His father was a <i>Sir</i>, wasn't he?" asked the
mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, a knight, not a baronet, so--"</p>

<p>"So Samuel Lovat Douglas will have to win instead of inherit
it. Well, that's the only kind of title there should ever be,"
Hector declared. "The Indians know what they are doing when they
have chiefs by character instead of by birth."</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser rose.</p>

<p>"I've got one or two chores to do yet," said he, "as the
English folk out here call them--a good old English word I have
no doubt. I'll away and finish them."</p>

<p>He departed toward the stables and Hector, leaping to the
ground, followed him.</p>

<p>"I'll just step in and see to the stove," said Mrs. Fraser.
"These autumn nights are a wee bit cool, though the days are
hot."</p>

<p>"I'll go," Fiona offered.</p>

<p>"No, no, I'll see to it."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you. I'll go and see if there's anything I can
do," said Mrs. Hector.</p>

<p>"You like it here?" asked Angus, when he and Fiona were
alone.</p>

<p>"I love it," she told him.</p>

<p>She stooped, running a hand up a stalk of sage, and shucked
off a palm-full of the little flowers. Then she crushed them in
her hand and held it open, setting free on the air the heavy
aromatic scent.</p>

<p>"I love that smell," said she.</p>

<p>She closed her hand, opened it again, and he bent to whiff the
fragrance of these crushed yellow blossoms. And it was once more
as it had been on that day when he walked out of the office with
her to greet the others--the day of their arrival. His being went
out beyond the confines of the body and hers, surely, he thought,
also knew that strange overflowing, because of an emotion he had
of meeting, mingling, of being one with her. He took her hand, he
drew her to him, and she leant to him in a great content. In that
embrace they shared ecstatic culmination, a rich beginning.</p>

<p>When Ian heard the news what he said was, "Aye--aye! When I
come to think of it I had an idea." Mrs. Fraser said, "Well, it
took me by surprise. I never expected it, but I am real, real
pleased, my dears, nevertheless and whatever!" Hector's wife
looked from her father-in-law to her mother-in-law and smiled a
cryptic smile. Hector, being Hector, had to sing:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>". . . the lady I adore,<br>
The one I would marry on the Red River shore!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Riding back to Calgary next day Angus sang also, with the
changing of a word:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>". . . the lady I adore,<br>
The one I would marry <i>from</i> the Red River shore."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>In the midst of his singing he ceased suddenly. He asked
himself if he should have told Fiona of Minota; and more, should
he have told her of a neglected son somewhere out on the Great
Plains? But that was past, far off. It was of a life even before
the comic interlude (in Sam's phrase) of the Ettrick brothers.
What could he do, he asked himself, about All Alone? Should he do
anything? Could he do anything? What would Fiona think he should
do were she to know of the lad's existence, Chief Buffalo Calf's
adopted son--<i>all Indian?</i></p>

<p>Riding into Calgary he saw busy movements by the track side. A
string of wagons was backed up beside a row of railway trucks.
Men were bending and rising at some labour there, and even from a
distance he knew by their motions they were not white. Drawing
closer he saw Sam Douglas on a horse, watching. There were
wagon-loads of bones, bones bleached like ivory, bones weathered
to a hue of lime. Indians in white men's clothes were shovelling
them into the trucks, their braids, as they stooped, swaying
pendulum-like. There was a great rasping of shovels as they
worked, and over everything hung a powdery white haze. Beyond the
newly laid track was a row of white stacks--more bones.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Angus! Back from seeing your forty-second cousins?"
hailed Sam. "And how are our guid friends?"</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"That's grand. Well, I just came over to see to the loading of
those trucks." He had a sudden inspiration and with a histrionic
gesture, a sweeping wave of a hand to the consignment of buffalo
bones--"<i>Voila les boeufs!</i>" he chanted as in valediction on
a life that was past.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c22">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Mr. Hodges Advises</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Hodges, from whom Angus was to take over control of the
Running Antelope Reservation, otherwise the High Butte
Reservation, a short, rotund man formed after the manner of a
bladder of lard, welcomed them with a vulgar and sincere
bonhomie. Angus was glad to have had the little man's name in
writing from Ottawa, for--</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Mrs. 'Odges is not here to greet you, Mrs. Munro,"
Hodges said to Fiona--careless but not consistently careless with
his aspirates. "She could not stand the isolation, nobody of her
own sex and colour to speak to bar the visiting missionary's
wife, and not often did she come with 'er husband. The poor woman
has her nose so tilted in the air, all because the reverend wears
a collar wrong way round, that she was no great cheer to my
missus when she did come. It's for the sake of Mrs. 'Odges I
applied for a change when the Western Commissioner came here
last. 'Eart to 'eart talk I had with him, man to man. I asked for
a transfer if possible to one of the reserves close to the new
railway, and I got it. My wife hasn't seen a train since she got
off the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba cars at Emerson. No
railway there when I came in. Boat down the Red River all the way
from Abercrombie, and you got to Abercrombie from St. Cloud on a
stage-coach. I suppose you've been out that long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Angus.</p>

<p>"And you?" Mr. Hodges turned to Fiona.</p>

<p>"I was born by Red River--"</p>

<p>"Well, well, a <i>Red River Shore</i> lady!"</p>

<p>"Yes. My people came in by Hudson's Bay and Nelson River."</p>

<p>"Hey Presto!" exploded Mr. Hodges. They took it to be his
substitute for other expletive when a lady was present. "I wish
you could 'ave seen Mrs. 'Odges to tell her that. I like this
country myself and I wrote her that I did. But sometimes, after
she came out and couldn't get used to it, always pining to be at
'ome, I got so I felt I got her out here under false pretences.
And then came a time her dislike affected me by a kind of
sympathy, perhaps, and I found myself calling it a hell of a
country. I beg your pardon, Mrs. Munro."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Fiona, laughing, and feeling what
can, perhaps, best be described as a merciful liking for the
man.</p>

<p>"Changes, changes!" Mr. Hodges continued. "I 'ear a rumour
that as like as not, after the railway is completed through the
mountains to the Pacific, they'll build a sideline from Calgary
to Fort Edmonton. When I tried to cheer my missus with that it
made her worse. 'We'll all be bones, like the buffalo, by then,'
she sez. Oh, yes, this is no plice for a woman what has been
accustomed to seeing lots of people and 'aving a full social
life. Well, she's gone off ahead of me, with all our sticks. I'm
boarding with Chantelaine, the clerk here. It will be great for
her at the new plice. The agency buildings are near the railway
and she'll be able, from the top window any'ow, to see the trains
go by--two a day, they tell me, one east and one west. Then
there'll be freight trains, and work trains, ballasting on the
new line and filling in culverts with gravel."</p>

<p>Fiona expressed her regret that Mrs. Hodges had been lonely
there and agreed that it would be nice for her, feeling as she
did, to see the trains go by.</p>

<p>"I used to tell her," said Mr. Hodges, "that with a little
imagination she could change the Indians in their battered
buggies and buckboards, and with their piebald ponies, into
gipsies by the 'edges of England; but she could never care for
the Indians, even pictorially. And it is 'ard for an English lady
to make friends with an Indian woman, even a chief's squaw--Mrs.
Running Antelope or the like. No, she just fretted 'ere. I don't
dislike the Indians myself, but I don't know as I'll stay in the
service," he prattled on, loquacious, as though glad himself of
someone new to speak to. "I've been dabblin' in buying and
selling town lots and I'm thinking of going in for politics.
Politics and the real estate game--'and in 'and--has somethink in
it, I think. I'm fond of public speakin'. These Indians, by the
way, they are great speech-makers. We have an interpreter here
and he ruins the speeches. I've just learnt enough Cree to
reckonize that. Florid they are, you know, talkin' about the
clouds and the grass and all that--like the Psalms of David. The
interpreter cuts it all down to <i>'E says 'e don't fancy
that,</i> or <i>'E says 'e agrees with you.</i> It's all lost. Do
you speak Cree, Mr. Munro?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, you can use the interpreter if you like and keep mum
about knowing Cree, not let them know. You might 'ear a lot that
way. That's for you to decide." He paused. "You're a
<i>Sandy</i>--I can 'ear that in your talk," and he stretched up
to lay a podgy hand on Angus's shoulder, showing he was entirely
friendly. "Ah, I know. Quick hear I 'ave!" He dropped his hand,
advanced it in air toward Fiona and ingratiatingly beaming upon
her, said he, "But he 'asn't said <i>whatever</i> yet, has he?"
and exploded genial chuckles.</p>

<p>Fiona laughed pleasantly in response.</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't said <i>whatever</i> yet," she agreed.</p>

<p>"I think," said Hodges, turning again to Angus, "that if your
good lady will excuse us we'll step across to the office and I'll
introduce you to Chantelaine and Macpherson. Chantelaine is the
clerk. Macpherson is the instructor. There is another clerk--Mr.
Peters, comes from near Bristol. He's away on leave of absence,
but he'll be back--let me see?--not till after I've gone.
Chantelaine will introduce him. Fine fellah. You'll like
him."</p>

<p>He laid a hand on his paunch, bowing to Fiona, and taking
Angus's arm walked away.</p>

<p>"We've got some of them started farming," he went on as they
passed out. "I don't say they are doing it with enthusiasm,
but--well, what can you expect?"</p>

<p>They left the agent's house, scliffed through a golden pool of
crisp leaves that lay under the upended besoms of a clump of
cotton poplars, and walked on toward the office. Hodges still
talking, Angus listening though raking the prospect with admiring
eyes. Winter, in the sense of flying snow, had not yet come when
they and their effects had been deposited at the Running Antelope
Reservation by the Calgary-Fort Edmonton road some distance, and
then along two ruts the twenty or thirty miles to the place of
their new life. To northwest the knob of High Butte showed purple
above quiet tones of frosted green. Westward, though not nearly
as clear as seen from Calgary on such a day, the Rockies were
fragmentarily declared by the loftier peaks--yonder and
yonder--already silvered by their altitude and gleaming in the
sun, or by some jutting of a promontory into the foothills. South
was but sky, blue sky. The agency buildings crouched near the rim
of a long coulee (just where it glided away into prairie), a
coulee in the bottom of which a riband of yellow twined,
indicating a creek's course there, and at every gust of wind that
dipped so far a streamer of gold would flutter and another
creekside tree turn from a jet of quaking leaves to a
stable-broom.</p>

<p>"Summer here is all right," remarked Hodges; "not too many
mosquitoes. The fall is great. I like the fall. Even my poor
missus loves the fall. Winter varies. I've seen the first
snow--to lie and stay, I mean--not till Christmas week. I've
known a winter we never used runners, wheels all the time on the
wagons. But I've also known a winter from November to May--real
winter, cold I mean. There was one Feb'uary I had to have a rope
from the 'ouse to the office else I might have lost my way in a
blizzard. I 'ope your good lady won't feel lonesome," he ended as
they passed under the rippling and sagging of a Union Jack atop a
white pole before the office.</p>

<p>Hodges flung open the door and swept a hand behind Angus's
back with a "Step in, step in. Ah, 'ere we are. I want to
introduce Mr. Munro--Mr. Chantelaine. Mr. Macpherson."</p>

<p>Nigel Chantelaine showed his race in more than name, in
vivacious dark eyes and quick movements, and Donald Macpherson
(from Bruce County, Ontario) announced or pronounced his in
<i>feesh</i> for fish in the little chat they had on meeting, and
in <i>speerit</i> for spirit--which was to receive such general
sanction in the land that even those prone to <i>somethinks</i>
and <i>nothinks</i> would speak of the <i>speerit</i> of a
man.</p>

<p>Angus admired the system, the method, the trigness of that
office. Mr. Hodges was clearly a man with a turn for business. He
had inventories ready for his successor to vis&eacute;. Stores,
account books and even the medicine chest must be examined. That
took all day and half of the next in the store-room and outer
office, and then they filled their pipes in the agent's own
room.</p>

<p>"You'll like Running Antelope," said Hodges. "I do get fat,"
he grunted, stooping for a dropped pencil that his sleeve had
brushed from the desk. "Even if I eat nothink I get fat. The
Indians call me Big Belly--quite friendly, you know. Yes, you'll
like Running Antelope. He's shrewd, a diplomatist. I think you'll
get on better with him than you'd have done with his predecessor,
who just didn't like whites being in the country. There's no
doubt about that. He had no personal animus against me, mind you,
but there it was--old Buffalo Calf merely tolerated us."</p>

<p>"Buffalo Calf?" said Angus in a tone that might have been of
inquiry to be sure he had the name aright, or of amazement for
some reason.</p>

<p>"Yes. He died three years ago. Why do you ask like that?"</p>

<p>"I met him once--when the Blackfeet, the Stoneys, and Sarcees
gathered at Blackfoot Crossing for the signing of Treaty Number
Seven."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember--he went down there then. I had just come
here. Well, he's gone now, he's a shadow now, as they say. Then
there are two sub-chiefs. There's Tall Whirlwind, a remarkable
man, though an old warrior with scalps galore I should think.
He's farming now, ploughing, not just with cattle. A good
example. Then there's one I can't help thinking has some white
blood in him, though his father and mother are both Indian. After
all, white persons have been through here for a hundred years and
some of them left traces. Throw-back. Big Beaver is his name.
He's a bit sly. He knows nothing about it when the police come to
look for evidence of cattle having been raided off and killed by
the Indians, but I've an idea he knows a lot about these little
games. He looks too deeply astonished at the inquiries."</p>

<p>"Buffalo Calf had a son, hadn't he?" Angus asked, refilling
his pipe.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but the chiefs are elected. The chieftainship ain't
'ereditary with these people."</p>

<p>"No. No, quite. I just recalled when I saw the old chap in '77
he told me he had a son. I saw the boy, as a matter of fact."</p>

<p>Hodges frowned, with a vague feeling of something of
indirectness in that last remark.</p>

<p>"He had two sons," he said, "two of his own--killed in raids
on the Blackfeet long ago, I believe, so he adopted another. The
fellah wears a ring he's very proud of. I think he prizes it like
a scalp-lock. Buffalo Calf gave it to him and he may have got it
off some brave south, who perhaps got it in his turn when
attacking one of the old emigrant trains down there. A nice ring.
It's queer the things they have. I was told that the Blackfeet
have an old cuirass--you know, a metal breastplate that they
brought home donkeys' years ago from a long trip south. It must
have belonged to one of the Cortez soldiers. They either got it
in a fight with the Spaniards or in a fight with other Indians
down there that stole it from the Spaniards. Interestin', isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angus, and disappointed Hodges by his seeming
failure to care for the subject. "What about this young
Indian?"</p>

<p>"The lad with the collet ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, he's all Indian from the heels up."</p>

<p>"Good Injun?" inquired Angus in casual tone.</p>

<p>Hodges grinned.</p>

<p>"He gets drunk when he can. It's difficult to nab all the
whisky smugglers," he said. "You can't be everywhere watching,
and there's such a thing as night--and there are dark nights. I
don't know what's happening all over the dark miles when I'm in
bed. Yah, it's a problem. He's all right in many ways, but when
he gets drunk he beats his squaw."</p>

<p>"He does, does he?" said Angus, and felt a sudden paternal
rage.</p>

<p>"Yes. This is his second--the woman he has now."</p>

<p>"Did he beat the first to death?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no. I understand he never beat her at all. She died
from the kick of a horse. He married this one a few months later.
The beating business seems to be a recent development. It's booze
that's at the back of it with him."</p>

<p>"We'll cure him of that!" said Angus in such a grim tone that
Hodges stared. No one with Munro blood in him was going to beat a
woman!</p>

<p>"You can't drive them, you know, Mr. Munro," said Hodges
urgently, alarmed at the new agent's vehemence. "You can't kick
an Indian in the pants. Raise your fist to them and they'll never
forgive you--unless you have a gun or a knife in it. They might
overlook that, bury the hatchet. Take the fists to them and
you're a dead man. It's an indignity they can't live down."</p>

<p>"I know. I know."</p>

<p>Hodges sucked in his belly to extricate his watch and glancing
at it--</p>

<p>"It's time we were going back to your good lady," said he, "to
help her get her house in order, moving any of the heavier things
she don't like in the first positions. Oh, I know the
ladies!"</p>

<p>Half that night Angus lay awake. He pondered telling Fiona of
Minota, of how he had left her, not aware she was with a child,
of how he knew nothing of that till by accident he encountered
Buffalo Calf--and the boy in his teens then. No, no, he could not
tell her now. She would wonder why he had not done so before.
Minota, he was sure, she would accept kindly, she being dead, a
dear shadow; but she might think he ought to have done something
for All Alone--despite Buffalo Calf's claim on the lad. "What
could I have done?" he asked of the dark night in reply to that
postulated censure. Here was All Alone turned twenty--and beating
his wife. He did not sleep till the dreadful quiet light of dawn
was in the room.</p>

<p>Four days later Indians came riding and driving to the agency
to meet the new agent and say good-bye to the old.</p>

<p>From a window Angus watched them arrive, a window in the
office. There was evidently no mock sentiment in him regarding
the natives, despite his Indian kink, for he remarked to himself
that there were some tough faces among them. Yes, they were
clearly not people who could be <i>kicked in the pants.</i> Had
he not known that already he would have realized it then. Some of
the men had a mercilessness in their bearing. Some of the women
looked of the sort who would cry <i>coward</i> to their sons and
husbands if they did not demand a tooth for a tooth and an eye
for an eye. All kinds were there. There were sonsy girls, squaws
shining like new-minted pennies from ablution with the bar-soap
of the agency store, laughing and chatting one to another as they
congregated. His view of the arrival of these folk, somewhat
(yes, somewhat) like the gipsies of the 'edges of England, was
only from the end window of Hodges' own room in the office
building. Frontwards was the waiting-room. The smell of
kinick-kinick and tobacco blent came sweeping in at the keyhole
and at the door's edges, a door made too soon of unseasoned wood.
From where he sat he could see a slit of light under it and
occasional gray shadows drifting there--people moving about in
the waiting-room, quiet, being in moccasins.</p>

<p>That smell of kinick-kinick stirred him, stirred the living
past and he was back at Rocky Mountain House when the Stoneys and
the Sarcees came to trade, back in the log-cabin beyond Jasper
with the blue jays when, tobacco at ebb, he had smoked that
mixture. A burst of laughter sounded without--and he was in the
Ettricks' shop, John Hill Burton conferring with him over a
sentence quoted by De Quincey from the travel book of a Mr. Weld.
It was not many lives he lived after all: it was one. A sound, an
odour, and the seemingly separate became unified. He lived not
many lives but the linked chapters of one.</p>

<p>"They are here," said Hodges at that burst of laughter, rising
and opening the door. "Come in, come in! You there, too, Jo? Come
in, Chief!"</p>

<p>The chiefs had dressed with care for the occasion. Their
braids were wrapped in otter skin; they wore their bravest
blankets over buckskins. Shell-rings were in their ears. As they
trooped in and stood awaiting presentation, Angus recalled the
Ioways in Princes Street.</p>

<p>"Well, here's your new white father," Hodges purled. "Chief
Running Antelope," and he waved a hand at that six feet of savage
like Julius Caesar on a copper coin (a blend of humour,
tolerance, sorrow, cynicism in the aspect of his hatchet-face),
with two eagle-tail feathers erect in his twisted scalp-lock.</p>

<p>Running Antelope gave the grunt, the little bow, holding out a
long lean hand that pressed Angus's lightly.</p>

<p>"I--am--pleased--to--meet--you," said he.</p>

<p>"And this," continued Hodges, laying a hand on the shoulder of
the next, whose cheeks were of the texture and hue of smoked
leather, profusely pitted with old pockmarks, "is Tall
Whirlwind--a good man. Heap good farmer. Plough, sow, harvest,
show the white man how, eh?"</p>

<p>A deprecating, perhaps a commiserating smile just twisted the
lips of Tall Whirlwind as he shook Angus's hand and bowed.</p>

<p>"And this--" Hodges slapped the last on the back--"is Big
Beaver."</p>

<p>Big Beaver's lips were thick yet close-set, his nose aquiline
though spread at the base in a distension of nostrils as by
deep-breathing. Two small upright puckers in the midst of his
forehead gave him an air of puzzlement in the manner of a Great
Dane or a lion, and the breadth of his cheek-bones was such as to
make the brow seem constricted, narrow in comparison. He, too,
was pitted with these gouges from the Great Sickness. Angus could
not detect in him evidence of the white man a generation or two
back surmised by Mr. Hodges, but did note a little light disc
under the pupils of his eyes, a whitish filmy sickle on the iris,
such as he had noted in the eyes of other Indians of advancing
years and seen in no white men.</p>

<p>"Only got drunk, to my knowledge, once in three years," said
Hodges, by way of completing his boisterous introductions. "Drink
no more, eh?"</p>

<p>Big Beaver looked aslant at him, shrugged his shoulders, and
with the little bow and the close-lipped grunt took the new
agent's hand as gently as had the others, but met his eyes not
with their studying, directness of gaze. Perhaps, thought Angus,
that was due to the little film that was forming there. The word
<i>trachoma</i> he did not know.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down! Be seated, Chiefs," said Hodges,
brightly. "Oh, this is our interpreter. You haven't met him yet,
Mr. Munro--Jo Two Guns."</p>

<p>The interpreter wore a white man's shirt with its ends not
tucked into but hanging down over wide blanket-trousers (in the
manner of the buckskin tunics then worn), a cowboy's hat on his
head, thick plaits pendant on either side. He was not sure if he
would receive the attention bestowed on the others, but Angus
held out his hand, the eyes of the three chiefs observant.</p>

<p>"Well, would you like to speak, Mr. Munro?" suggested
Hodges.</p>

<p>The interpreter stood out in the middle of the floor,
waiting.</p>

<p>"I 'ave some cigars over here," Hodges broke out.</p>

<p>"We'll all 'ave one," and he took the box round, bobbing from
one to another with it, then bobbing again to hold matches for
them. That over--there they all sat, dumb.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say?" asked Hodges, looking at Angus,
the interpreter still standing in the middle of the room,
waiting.</p>

<p>Angus rose and began to speak in Cree. The three chiefs stared
rigidly at him, then in Indian fashion sat forward, heads lowered
a little to one side, giving ear, as he told them he had seen his
first Cree when sixteen snows, and that he had gone to the
Mountain House and there had--he hesitated. The three heads were
raised a little and the three pairs of eyes probed into his
pause. There, he said, he had met other Crees as well as Stoneys
and Sarcees. After that he explained that he went across the big
lake that is salt, to east, and there when he heard wind in the
grass it was in his ears the wind in the grass of the prairies,
and if he heard a river its voice was the voice of the prairie
rivers. There he met three Indians. Their tribal name in Cree he
did not know, but their sign was so--and the three heads, aslant
and bowed, rose and the sign was observed. On seeing them, Angus
continued, with all their feathers (Running Antelope and Tall
Whirlwind chuckled) he could stay no longer, and came back, and
here he was and his heart was glad.</p>

<p>"I have finished," he ended, according to the ritual.</p>

<p>Running Antelope rose. Hodges sat back and folded his hands on
his paunch to await a florid speech. He was getting ready to nod
to Jo to interpret it for his sake, but there was none.</p>

<p>"Good. Friend. Good," said Running Antelope, and shook Munro's
hand again. He seemed to be tremendously impressed.</p>

<p>The other two stood up then, shook hands with Angus, then
stepping back glanced pointedly at the head chief. He turned to
Hodges, who bobbed up, disappointed that there was to be no
eloquence. There were three solemn handshakes, three grunts, and
then Running Antelope conjured from under his vivid blanket a
bundle--a deerskin bundle bound round with strips of rawhide much
knotted. Having put that on Hodges' desk he wheeled and stalked
out, the others following, shutting the door behind them
quietly.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said Hodges, and began to undo the knots.</p>

<p>Having removed the wrapping there was disclosed only another
below it, in its turn, bound with knotted rawhide thongs.
Wrapping after wrapping he removed, each similarly tied.</p>

<p>"It's a practical joke!" he exclaimed, but continued, as one
takes out basket after basket from a Japanese nest of them.</p>

<p>At last he came to an end and held up a calumet, its bowl of
lustrous red stone, its polished stem protected with a covering
of otter skin.</p>

<p>"Hey Presto!" he cried out. "Well, I'll be damned! Do you know
what this is?"</p>

<p>"A calumet, and a fine one."</p>

<p>"Yes, a beaut', but I must tell you about it. I wanted to
trade for it, from Running Antelope, but <i>No, not for sell, not
for buy.</i> And now--stop him, Jo, like a good fellah, so that I
can thank him."</p>

<p>"He's a mile off by now," said Angus. "It's what they call a
free gift. That's why it was wrapped up that way--to let him get
well away."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," said Hodges again. He took out a
handkerchief and mopped his forehead. "Now you know whether they
liked me or not. Damned if I'm not sorry to go. And yet there's
no doubt this is no plice for a woman, no plice for a woman," he
repeated, holding up the pipe this way and that.</p>

<p>Jo Two Guns, though no doubt knowing his errand in vain, had
stepped out through the waiting-room to see if the chief was in
sight. Returning, he said: "They're gone. There's just some
people hanging around, I guess to say good-bye to you."</p>

<p>"Well, bring 'em in. No, we'll go out and see them."</p>

<p>Yes, Big Belly was liked, thought Angus--at least by some.
They went out in front of the building where little groups
clustered. They moved from one to another, Hodges keeping up a
running fire of chatter.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, good-bye," he chanted. "Good man. Pretty woman.
Heap sorry to go. This is Mr. Munro, new agent, new white father.
He speaks Cree good. You say something in Cree to them, Mr.
Munro."</p>

<p>But everybody seemed self-conscious. There they were to say
good-bye and all like shy children who had forgotten the little
piece they were to recite and could only smile, nod, laugh
and--as for the women--clap a hand to their mouths to hide the
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hodges a few minutes later, "that's that. I think
we'll move on now. I've just remembered you haven't inspected the
slaughter-house, the beef-issue house. Come on. We'll step over
there."</p>

<p>The groups thinned away. Horses that had been standing with
drooping heads, as though weary of life, suddenly turned to fiery
steeds when mounted, caracoled sharply and rub-a-dubbed away.
Democrat wagons, buggies and battered buckboards received their
load and departed as the old and the new agent walked along to
the beef-issue buildings.</p>

<p>"This door should have had the pin dropped in the staple
instead of just left hanging," remarked the methodical Hodges. He
opened the door, then abruptly slammed it shut.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"Coyotes in there. Didn't you see all the eyes shine to the
light? Hie!" He cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted to some
young men who were riding away. They looked over their shoulders,
wheeled, rode back. "Some of you boys get down here like good
fellahs," said Hodges, "and shoot up the coyotes inside. The door
must have been left open at night and slammed shut in a
wind."</p>

<p>They knew sufficient English amongst them, without need of any
pidgin-Cree from Hodges or fluent Cree from Angus, to understand
that. Hilariously they slipped from the saddles, on near-side or
off-side, no matter which, their horses trained so. Two had
rifles. They opened the door again and then crash went shot after
shot into the slaughterhouse at the targets of these eyes that
glinted to the outer daylight from its gloom.</p>

<p>On one of those who shot Angus's gaze had been keen, direct,
appraising.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me?" he asked.</p>

<p>The young man turned as the others went inside to drag out the
slain coyotes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember you," he replied. "I saw you when the
Blackfeet went to the Ridge under the Water to sign the
treaty."</p>

<p>Angus looked his son directly in the eyes. Both were of a
height, about six feet.</p>

<p>"I am the new agent here." said Angus, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"You are our new white father, then," said All Alone,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I am your new father," responded Angus; and had Sam Douglas
seen him then he would have thought that Angus Munro <i>looked
his years.</i></p>

<p>Hodges, standing by waiting for the others to drag out the
carcasses, was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Somethink odd," he mused, "in this Sandy's manner."</p>

<p>Enlightenment came to him. He thought he understood: the new
agent was remembering, no doubt, what he had heard of All Alone
beating his squaw when he got drunk; so, after he had carefully
dropped the wooden peg in place to secure the door, falling in
step with Angus to walk to the agency, Hodges said:</p>

<p>"You can't kick an Indian in the pants, Mr. Munro--nor a
half-breed, for that matter."</p>

<p>"I know, I know."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Chantelaine was an eager and interested aide with no faintest
peevishness (even before he discovered that Angus did assuredly
know something of Indians) that one new to the service had been
set in authority over him. Peters, the clerk who had been on
vacation, soon came also to admire the new chief's management.
Both lauded to themselves, and took lessons from his restraint,
his capacity for calm discussion without ever a flame of even
suppressed anger in his eyes, his manner with his wards, when
they were <i>difficult</i>, as of having studied in the school of
Solomon. Neither had seen him wring the neck of a small jay at a
sudden fierce impulse! Perhaps in his immediate regret for that
he had learnt the control they admired.</p>

<p>He had a slightly different attitude to the Indians from that
of Hodges. Hodges had seen himself as the guardian and dispenser
of charity. Angus saw himself as the representative of a
government that had made treaty with these people, arranging, in
return for surrender of lands, for certain payments, attentions
and offices.</p>

<p>He organized a native police force for the reserve. He set
apart one day a week for the chiefs to come and see him, whether
there was any tribal matter to discuss or not, and on that day
others who had domestic affairs in which they wanted advice would
come and confer with him.</p>

<p>All winter he had been very busy and had occasionally seen All
Alone at the agency. It was not till the late spring that he had
either occasion or opportunity to look into what may be called
his private affairs--private family affairs.</p>

<p>One visiting day the chiefs had chatted, smoked, and gone. In
the outer waiting-room a young squaw, who had been watching for
their departure, rose and came diffidently into the private
office.</p>

<p>"I'm Tannisse All Alone," she said.</p>

<p>Angus swallowed suddenly. She was a little creature with eyes
like those of a deer, very clean in person and apparel (which all
were not), her hair in lustrous plaits--and there was a great
weal across her forehead. Imagine beating that, thought he,
swallowing again.</p>

<p>"Sit down. You want to speak to me about something?"</p>

<p>"Just to you," she replied. "They tell me that our new white
father is a wise man."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I have had enough," she said. She put a hand to the wound on
her forehead. She drew back her blanket and showed another on her
arm. "My man has beaten me too much. The other agent told me to
stay with him and that he would speak to him, but I can stand no
more. I am going back to my father now. I want you to know. I
have had enough. I have told you. It is finished."</p>

<p>She rose then, turning away, opened the door and went out.</p>

<p>Yes, an Indian agent has to study in the school of Solomon,
thought Angus. He went outside. One of those he had appointed to
police the reserve was sitting on the steps.</p>

<p>"I think it would be good," said Angus (never did he begin,
<i>I want you to do . . .</i> It is hardly in the Indian speech),
"I think it would be good to ride every day near the lodge of the
father of Tannisse All Alone."</p>

<p>"I will ride myself every day near that lodge," replied the
man.</p>

<p>Fiona wondered what might be the cause of her husband's quiet
that evening.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" she asked. "Any troubling matters
today?"</p>

<p>He seemed startled by the inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only one of the men has been beating his squaw--and
she is such a little thing!" he said.</p>

<p>"It's dreadful!"</p>

<p>"It's dreadful."</p>

<p>"Are you doing anything about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking what to do."</p>

<p>He waited to hear further news. Two days later the policeman
to whom he had spoken came in.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to report," he said.</p>

<p>"Not about the lodge of Tannisse All Alone's father?"</p>

<p>"There is no trouble there. She is living with her father. I
see. I stopped to talk and smoke."</p>

<p>"That is good."</p>

<p>The policeman went away. Just before noon the door opened and
All Alone entered. He had dressed himself for the visit. He had
ochre paint on his face; he had little brass rings round the
braids that hung below the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Angus.</p>

<p>All Alone sat down and there was silence. Angus looked at him.
<i>All Indian,</i> eh? <i>Indian from the heels up?</i> He sat
like an effigy. By the way the light fell a hint of gray was
discernible in the dark eyes, but that did not necessarily
indicate white blood in him. Chief Crowfoot of the Blackfeet had
gray in his eyes and one could go back a long way in his ancestry
and find only Indian blood, and no rumour of any cuckolding by,
or obliging of, any white explorer. The Blackfeet cut the noses
of unfaithful squaws and the unfaithful husband was scourged. The
Bannacks, by the way, made the man pay damages--or killed him and
let the woman go. Gray eyes could be seen in tribes that had
never had touch with white men. Gray in the iris did not mean
that one was not <i>Indian from, the heels up.</i></p>

<p>There was something of Minota in the young man's face, much of
Minota. Angus looked at the hand that held the blanket in place,
at the ring on it.</p>

<p>"I have come to see if you will get my woman back to me," said
All Alone. "She has left you?"</p>

<p>"She has left me."</p>

<p>"Why did she go?"</p>

<p>"Because I beat her."</p>

<p>"Why did you beat her? What had she done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was drunk."</p>

<p>"Are you going to get drunk again?"</p>

<p>"I may. I do not know. I never know."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Get her back to me."</p>

<p>"Do you think I will get her back for you to beat again next
time you are drunk?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Angus studied that face. Yes, there was a strong resemblance
to Minota there. The eyes were like hers then in their wide
innocence: <i>innocence</i> seemed to be the right word.</p>

<p>"I like her," said All Alone at last. "I am lonely without
her."</p>

<p>"Lonely without her," Angus echoed. "Have you asked her to
come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And she will not come," said Angus with a note of
triumph.</p>

<p>"No. That is why I am here. She says no. It is the last time,
she says. I am fond of her."</p>

<p>"You want me to ask her to go back to you for you to beat her
again?"</p>

<p>All Alone made no reply, but produced from under his blanket a
small packet. He opened it and held forth a photograph. Angus
took it from him. It showed him very erect with his hand on the
back of a chair, and in the chair sat an Indian girl. To one side
of her was a small round table with a book and a vase on it. Her
elbow rested on the table's edge.</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?" Angus asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"That is my first woman," All Alone answered.</p>

<p>"Your first?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then All Alone produced another photograph.</p>

<p>"This," he explained, "is my second woman, the one who has
left me. It is of her alone. I wonder if you could get a man who
makes these pictures to take out my first woman and put this
woman in her place. If you could get a man to do that--take out
the first woman and put this one in--perhaps she would come
back."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said Angus. He was about to put the
photographs in his pocket, but All Alone handed him the deerskin
wrapping. He folded that round them, and said he, "I shall see
what I can do."</p>

<p>Meditation on the matter sent him with Fiona to Calgary next
day--close upon a week's drive, but with two new way-houses with
a roof for travellers when they came to the Calgary-Edmonton
road. The Rockies were a white frozen wave westward, but snow was
all gone from the prairie and among the rolling hills lingered
only in those creases that, by their position, received no more
than a few hours' sunshine. On all the sloughs ducks were
talking.</p>

<p>Two nights under a roof and two under stars: they would look
back on that little journey before long and think, remembering,
that they should feel old. Hardly could they recognize Calgary,
so rapidly were the houses going up.</p>

<p>Their first visit was to Sam's office, and there they found
him in high spirits. The original townsite had been on the east
bank of Elbow River. Douglas had believed that the west would be
the chosen one (or perhaps "friends at court" had whispered to
him) and there had bought land and held it. Therefore, with the
ultimate survey of the townsite on the west side he had been
gaily reaping. Was there a photographer in Calgary? Angus wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"Yes. Everything is here now! Mark my words, you won't know
the place if you come back in another six months."</p>

<p>The photographer was found.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Angus, "if it would be possible to make some
sort of composite picture--to take this figure and put it in
place of that--or even the face alone, in exchange."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's an idea of one of my Indians. I'm an Indian agent
and they come to me with lots of odd requests. This is his first
wife and he wants to put this one, his second wife, in her
place--"</p>

<p>The photographer cast back his head and bayed to the
ceiling--but he guessed he would have a stab at it.</p>

<p>"Ain't they queer people?" he cried out. "Leave the two with
me and I'll have a stab at it. Yep, I guess I can make a nice
picture of his second wife in his first wife's place--good enough
to satisfy an Injun, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I would like to get back as soon as possible," said
Angus.</p>

<p>"I'll get busy on it right away. Come in tomorrow."</p>

<p>To be so far on the way to Highwood River--two-thirds of the
distance, or so--and not go on to surprise them there was
tantalizing, but they promised themselves a visit to the ranch
later in the year.</p>

<p>Well, it was cleverly done. Angus laughed when he held the
result in his hand. A week later, back on the reserve, he saw the
agency policeman--the one who had kept an eye for a day or two on
the lodge of Tannisse's father.</p>

<p>"I think it would be good." he told him, "to go out and bring
in All Alone."</p>

<p>"Do I bring him with my gun?"</p>

<p>"No. He will come without a gun."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>All Alone was keeping close to home. He arrived speedily,
though again he had taken pains with his toilette for the
visit.</p>

<p>"There you are!" said Angus.</p>

<p>All Alone studied the new picture and smiled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that will bring her back," he said. "Now I will send
it to her. I will not go myself." He wrapped up all three prints
carefully together. "I will send it to her--and wait."</p>

<p>Three days later he returned, very gloomy over the
waiting.</p>

<p>"She will not come back," he said. "I went to see her today
because I was lonely for her. I thought, perhaps, the one I gave
the picture to, to take to her, had not given it to her. But he
had. She said it made no difference. It is not that she thinks I
think more of the first woman. She said I have beaten her once
too often. Will you go and see her and ask her to come back?"</p>

<p>Angus pointed a finger at his son.</p>

<p>"I will," he said. "I will--if you promise me this: that you
will not get drunk again."</p>

<p>"I cannot promise that because I do not know, and if I make a
promise I always keep it. It is not well to break a promise."</p>

<p>"Make this one and keep it."</p>

<p>"I do not know if I can. That is why I will not promise."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>They sat silent a while.</p>

<p>"This I will promise," said All Alone after profound thought,
"I will not beat her again."</p>

<p>Angus shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" he demanded. "If you get drunk you
may."</p>

<p>"No. I will be very strong even if I am drunk and remember I
have promised."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, then," said Angus. "I'll see what I can
do."</p>

<p>All Alone rose and left him. That afternoon Angus saddled a
horse and rode to the lodge of the father of Tannisse All
Alone.</p>

<p>"No," said Tannisse, when he spoke to her, "I have told him.
This is the last time."</p>

<p>Angus had the impression that he could, by his influence,
renew and retain marital felicity in the home of his Indian
son.</p>

<p>"Then you will not mind," said this disciple of Solomon, "if
All Alone takes another woman, seeing that you won't go
back?"</p>

<p>A look of startlement passed in Tannisse's eyes at that
suggestion. Then she was grim again.</p>

<p>"No," she said, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied Angus easily. "You will not go
back?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"So he can take another woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>He rode back to the agency and left it so for the time
being.</p>

<p>In the evening he told Fiona all he had done and as he told
her, so deeply interested was she, there came a moment when it
was but as the breadth of a hair between his retention of his
secret and his revelation of it to her. "I want to tell you
something . . ." He did not say that: he thought it. "I want to
tell you, Fiona, about the days when I was at Rocky Mountain
House and . . ." No, he could not speak. He was intensely happy
with his wife--and did not wish to cloud that happiness. He did
not realize that were she to know of Minota and Minota's son,
closer might she have come to him.</p>

<p>Next day he happened to be looking out of the window in the
main office, thinking his own thoughts--of Fiona and his past,
Minota, All Alone, Tannisse, Fiona--when there came two riding
together, an Indian and a squaw.</p>

<p>All Alone and Tannisse!</p>

<p>Angus passed into his room and sat down at his table to await
them. The door opened. They came in, both smiling.</p>

<p>"I have come to let you know," said All Alone, "that she has
come back to me."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Angus. He put a hand on his son's shoulder.
"Now will you repeat that promise with Tannisse to hear?"</p>

<p>"What promise?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise to us both not to beat her again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that! I will not beat her again. I have promised her. I
promise you. Even when I get drunk I will not beat her again. I
will try not to get drunk, but about that I cannot promise. I
will not beat her again."</p>

<p>Angus walked out with them, saw them ride away. As he turned
back, the snapping of the Union Jack atop its pole, as it flicked
to a plucking wind, and the thrashing of the halyard, sounded
like faint applause, perhaps not ironic.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c24">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Birth</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Time seemed to fly that spring for Fiona and Angus, happy
together, happy with the weather, even with the gummy-sheathed
buds of the cottonwoods in the coulee, the rattling of catkin
clusters, the burnished tone of red-willow stems.</p>

<p>At this season occasional homesickness often came to him such
as his mother was never without. The link, the hint that led his
mind to Scotland, might be vague, in a scent or a word, or
obvious--on hearing, for example, some song of the land that had
been his forebears'. A party of glee-singers coming west once on
tour, Fiona and he went to Calgary to hear them. For an encore
they gave <i>Over the Sea to Skye</i> and sang him back to the
country from which his people had been cast out. He saw a stream,
little more than a foot broad--not so broad as an irrigation
ditch in this west--with miniature cut-banks, and miniature falls
rumbling into little whirls of water-beads, and was a boy again
guddling for trout, a boy again shouting to the shout of the
flowing tide among the Black Rocks by Loch Brendan. A sudden hate
came to him for landlords and factors who had exiled his folk;
then--for he hated hate--he dismissed it from his mind: he told
himself that like Sam (remembering what Sam had said to him once
on the <i>International</i> as they came down Red River) he was,
after all, unfitted to live over there again. The land of exile
was also the land of adoption; but still, even while so thinking,
he was humming:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mull was astern, Rum on the port,<br>
Eigg on the starboard bow . . ."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>In his work Angus was very happy. The agency police had been a
great help to him--and to the Redcoats--in keeping fire-water
from the reservation. The sole temptation, so far, for them to
disappoint the trust in them had been in that fire-water, but
they had--so far--been incorruptible. Macpherson was happy. He
had several new pupils to instruct in the <i>white man's
road</i>, behind a plough, though still the preference of those
whom he called <i>our progressives</i> was for cattle-raising.
Peters, observing good cheer as part of Fiona, thought the west
was a place for a woman and mused much of a girl in Toronto. He
must tell her of the settlement--it was called, obviously, High
Butte--only twenty miles to northwest. He had been long enough in
that land of accepted distances to have other measure of
proximity than obtained in urban centres. Chantelaine, habitually
happy, was devoted to the new agent and the new agent's wife.</p>

<p>As for All Alone--shortly after the return of Angus and Fiona
from Calgary, he arrived at the office to talk about a man he had
heard of at Medicine Hat who made pictures. He showed some
specimens. They gave the impression of being good portraits,
though the sitters, in each one, were taken against what appeared
to be but a sheet tacked to a wall and the poses were
stereotyped: elbow inevitably on table where inevitably reposed
the family Bible atop a clasped album, and beside which was a
vase of dogwood leaves.</p>

<p>All Alone wanted to go down to Medicine Hat with his woman to
have their portraits taken together--the genuine article. Despite
the surrender of thousands of square miles of their original
lands the Indians were not confined by the precincts of their
reserves. They were not relentlessly immured. The treaties
allowed of their passing beyond the borders to hunt, while game
lasted--or to have their photographs taken.</p>

<p>Well, they went; and Tannisse came back alone, very sad.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong," observed Angus as soon as she
entered his room.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said he, "sit down," and then--"He is not dead, is
he?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"He did not beat me."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"It was in Medicine Hat. We had the picture made. Then he went
into the village alone from our tepee and a white man sold him
whisky. But he did not come back and beat me. He stabbed a
policeman."</p>

<p>"Stabbed a policeman!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Killed him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Not bad. The policeman hit him over the head with the
handle of his quirt. They open the handles and melt a white stone
and pour it in. It hardens inside and is covered over again. That
makes the handle like a war club. He sent a message. He said I
was to tell you he had got drunk but had not beaten me. I went to
see him in the--" she could find no Cree word for jail, so raised
a hand before her with spread fingers, looking between them to
convey the bars in a cell's door.</p>

<p>"How long will he be there?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"Three moons."</p>

<p>The three months passed quickly, at least for Angus if not for
Tannisse. Chantelaine went on vacation to visit his people in
Winnipeg. Macpherson, the red-headed Canadian Highlander from
Ontario, the sowing over and the spring round-up (that was more
to the taste of his pupils than shambling and stumbling behind a
kicking plough), went for a holiday to Bruce County. Peters,
after Chantelaine came back, departed to Toronto; and on his
return Angus and Fiona drove down to Calgary again, had a glimpse
of Sam Douglas there, and went on to the Highwood River ranch,
finding no visible alteration in Mr. and Mrs. Fraser, they still
at that span of life when there seems to be a halt physically, no
facial change, whatever mind and spirit may be experiencing.</p>

<p>On the way home they looked in on Sam again and he had
disturbing news. Riel--they would remember Louis Riel--was back
in the country from his exile in Montana to lead, so said rumour,
a rising of the <i>M&eacute;tis.</i></p>

<p>"The situation is serious," Douglas opined. "It is a time for
tact instead of for ignoring. They have, I think, their
grievances more or less--and assuredly their fears. It's the old
trouble, intensified. They fear the loss of their lands. They
have the impression that the white men engaged on survey work are
a collection of rogues in league with the land-grabbers."</p>

<p>When they reached the agency the blue gentians were streamers
and pools for Fiona's delight--and the time for the return of All
Alone was due. Angus prepared carefully a little talk in the
nature of temperance homily, that he called to himself his
<i>fatted calf.</i></p>

<p>Tannisse, who had been counting the days, arrived at the
agency with a led-horse one afternoon and sat there till
sundown--and no All Alone. She went home dejected and was sitting
on the office steps, smoking a little pipe for solace, when Angus
went across the next morning, two horses with drooping heads
beside her under a limp Union Jack.</p>

<p>About noon there was the rattle of a patrol wagon, its horses
briskened up for a final dash to the gate. A Redcoat looped the
lines over the brake-handle and climbed down to deliver All
Alone--who leapt out after him--and get the receipt.</p>

<p>Angus, in his office, cleared his throat in preparation to say
his little sermon. He could not but admire the build and carriage
of his Indian son. All Alone had bought a new hat (of the kind
called ten gallon) that had a devil-may-care and saucy flaunt of
brim. As he entered he swept it off.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said he, chanted he, in fact. "Good
afternoon! Just back from college."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" exclaimed the policeman.</p>

<p>Angus said nothing at all, his homily, his little lecture
gone.</p>

<p>Tannisse, sitting there awaiting the return, was all
admiration and devotion. Father and unacknowledged son looked at
each other. Then an ingratiating smile lit All Alone's face and,
his woman rising, she and he walked happily away. From the window
Angus watched them ride off.</p>

<p>"Pretty good Injun all the same," remarked the policeman, who
remained to eat a meal with them.</p>

<p>Over that meal he gave them more news of that brewing
rebellion of which Sam Douglas has spoken. There had been a
meeting of the <i>M&eacute;tis</i> at St. Laurent at which a
speaker had stated that the Northwest Territory belonged to the
Indian and to the half-breeds, not to the Dominion government for
it to dispose of as it pleased. A new police-post was to be
established at Fort Carlton and the force was being increased
specially for the patrolling of that sweep of country from
Carlton and Prince Albert to Ellice.</p>

<p>"It's clear that Trouble is expected in that quarter," the
Redcoat told them.</p>

<p>That was in September. The year was flying. Soon the wild
asters (that Fiona loved to have in the house in great clusters)
bloomed again, as usual, and the fleabane was in flower to tell
the season whatever the conspiracies or tribulations of men
across these leagues.</p>

<p>It was then that Big Beaver came to the office, inviting the
agent to accompany him on a fall hunt. Fiona was pregnant--near
to five months gone--and thought it better that she should remain
at home, though asked to accompany them. Resolutely she contested
Angus's view that, for her sake, he should not leave her. She
pointed out that to have such an invitation from Big Beaver was
evidence of how Angus was <i>making good</i> in the reserve. She
pointed out, further, that Big Beaver would feel hurt, perhaps
offended, if he did not accept. Only when she said, "Well, then,
I shall just have to go also, though I think I shouldn't," did he
submit to going and leaving her.</p>

<p>The Indians, for the fall hunt, went in small parties through
the hills and often, in the following days, he was reminded, by
the scent, sight and sound--smell of red-willow smoke, shadow on
bole of tree, tom-tomming of creeks--of his first meeting with
Minota. He felt, too, that he was not living many lives but
living a double life, because of Fiona knowing nothing of
Minota--and because he grew more and more devoted to Fiona.</p>

<p>"I have had a very happy time in the hills with you," he said
to Big Beaver on the way back. "The hunting has been good. You
have good venison, good moose-meat, and good hides for making
many moccasins. I hope we may go hunting again next year."</p>

<p>Big Beaver turned his head and looked at him pensively a
moment.</p>

<p>"I am growing old," he replied solemnly. "I may be dead by
then; but if I am not here next year I hope your hunting will be
good."</p>

<p>And Herbert Hodges had thought that Big Beaver had white blood
in him!</p>

<p>"I hope you will be here," said Angus as calmly, but with a
catch in his voice--for he had that Indian kink, as Sam Douglas
said, and these people often moved him suddenly, poignantly, with
a word.</p>

<p>There seemed to be little amiss with the old man save that his
sight was not as good as it had been. He had a way of lowering
his head and peering as though to see under some barrier or
through a haze. In aiming his rifle, stock held tightly to
shoulder and cheek, his face would pucker in a multitude of
wrinkles as he strained for a clear view along the sights. But
that little failing of vision seemed to be all that was wrong
with him; yet they had not been back a month when he was gathered
to his fathers, slipped away in his sleep one night to join the
procession on the Ghost Trail that is thronged beyond counting.
Mrs. Beaver knew that where his shadow went there would be
buffalo aplenty and good water, but she grieved over her loss,
put ashes in her hair, and cut off a finger, which she cast into
the blanket and deerskin in which he was wrapped and sewed. She
keened and cried all night under the tree in the forks of which
his body was elevated.</p>

<p>A new sub-chief had to be chosen to take his place in the
council of the band. Angus had an idea: As the bad boy of the
class is made monitor he thought of using what influence he might
have toward the appointment of All Alone. A responsible position
might be the making of him. He discussed the matter with Running
Antelope, being frank with him, up to a certain point, regarding
his reason, but asking that it might be their secret. The chief
chuckled over that motive and, holding his left hand out before
him, slightly arched, slipped the right below it and held it
there a moment--in the sign for secrecy. It was better than a
wink!</p>

<p>The friends of All Alone were mostly of those impetuous youths
who would fain live up to the stories of the old days as told by
their grandfathers round the winter fires. He had already been
spoken of by them, young though he was, as one who might be voted
for. Into the agency he came one day for a chat, a day when idle
odd flakes of snow, no larger than a pin-head, trembled down and
vanished, and the horses that waited before the office looked
disconsolate. To west was no hint of the mountains on the
horizon, there being no horizon there, only gray space. All Alone
had heard gossip that the agent was hopeful that those who wished
to elect him as a sub-chief would have their way.</p>

<p>"Why do you want me to be a chief?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Angus did not reply, <i>Because you are my son and because I
want to do my best for you.</i> Nor did he say, <i>Because I
think if you were in a position of trust you would stop drinking
firewater at every opportunity.</i> All Alone, thinking over that
gossip he had heard of the agent being for him, had recalled how
Angus, on their first meeting--or their first parting, rather--in
some inexplicable emotion had raised his hands aloft, lowering
them toward him in blessing.</p>

<p>"Because I think you are at heart a good man and would make a
good chief," said Angus.</p>

<p>By a large majority the young man was, in the event,
elected.</p>

<p>On the day the first snow came, one of the agency policemen
had a duty diffidently to perform. By his diffidence Angus
realized that the band was divided in the question of joining
Riel's rebels or remaining aloof--neutral. There was a half-breed
on the reservation, he said, who was calling meetings and
addressing the people. Angus did not ask if Running Antelope was
party to it. It was understood that his police were not spies
upon the chiefs.</p>

<p>"It will be good if you bring him to me," suggested Angus.</p>

<p>"If I bring him with a gun there may be trouble. And I do not
think he will come without one. Many of the people give ears to
his words."</p>

<p>"Then do nothing," said Angus. "I shall speak to the chiefs.
Tomorrow is the day they all come to smoke with me."</p>

<p>But before the morrow--that very afternoon--there arrived
three Redcoats (one of these by the way, a son of Charles
Dickens, the novelist) who had received information that
emissaries of Riel were in the vicinity drumming for recruits.
Yes, said Angus, he had heard only that morning of one who had
arrived. The three policemen rode away, directed to where the
half-breed was camped, and Angus watching for their return, saw
the snow turn from starch-blue to gold and red, then suddenly
fade to desolation in twilight.</p>

<p>There they came. The half-breed had evidently been warned of
their proximity and had fled. They stayed the night and there was
much talk again of what was afoot in the land--volunteer forces
being raised at Winnipeg, and at the other end of the plains,
cowboys being sworn in to patrol the Benton-Calgary road and
neighbourhood. Militia were coming from the east. Cloud was over
man's affairs from the Red River to the Belly. Angus now and
then, as he listened, looked at Fiona, worried lest she might be
agitated, because of her condition.</p>

<p>Frequent patrols came their way. On Christmas Day there sat
down to dinner in the agent's house (Angus and Chantelaine--who
was a remarkable cook--helping Fiona to prepare the feast) not
only the staff but a mounted policeman--none other than Gus
Atkins, who had been caught, according to Sam, by <i>the sojers'
buttons and the clink of spurs.</i> All through the winter
patrols came to the reserve, though the Running Antelope band was
not among those distrusted. Further east the Big Bear Band, the
Ermine Skin and the Bobtail--were sullen and suspect. There was
much rain instead of snow, dismal sleet adding somewhat to a
sense (or, indeed, more than a sense, a consciousness, in view of
all that was known) of calamity impending.</p>

<p>Fear was in the land, the mounted police told them. A panic
suddenly seized many in Calgary, the restless Blackfeet so near
them, and messages were sent to those Redcoats who had been
despatched through the mountain passes to keep order among the
railway construction gangs, imploring them to return. From Red
River to the Rockies people recalled stories of early massacres,
such as one that occurred in the beginning of the century near
where Qu'Appelle flows into Assiniboine: a fur party was set upon
there and even a six-months' old child was a target for the
arrows. The Minnesota massacre, of which Jessie Grant had talked
at Lasswade, they remembered. Though they did not freely speak of
it they knew that whites had as mercilessly and barbarously slain
Indians. They dreaded a revenge for such exploits as the Baker
Massacre and the massacre in the Cypress Hills.</p>

<p>One day early in March (Angus with his own anxiety because of
intermittent pains having begun for Fiona), Running Antelope came
to confer with him. Peters sent him over from the office, knowing
that Angus wished to stay close to his wife that day. The agent
was amazed, during that talk, to discover how much his Indians
knew of the whole country's affairs. This head-chief seemed to
know more than the mounted police, telling him that Chief
Crowfoot of the Blackfeet had ridden down to discuss with Red
Crow of the Bloods the advisability of joining the half-breeds,
but Red Crow had refused to join, would have nothing to do with
the rising. The Redcoats had not known of that, apparently,
though they had told him that P&egrave;re Lacombe (of whom he had
first heard from Minota years before), and P&egrave;re
Douc&eacute;t, had gone to advise the Blackfeet against
participation. Evidently Running Antelope was aware of all that
was afoot from the Red River to the Belly, from the North
Saskatchewan to the border--and beyond. The half-breeds of Riel
were among the Lakotah or Dakotah Indians--the Sioux--and some of
them might come north to help the insurgents.</p>

<p>"What would you advise us to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It would be better to take no part," said Angus.</p>

<p>"My people are divided," replied Running Antelope. "I come to
you now to ask because you think much for us. If Riel won would
that be the end? Would the Indians again own all the land? Big
Belly, he who was here before you came, was a good man. His heart
was not hard, his tongue was straight, but he thought as a white
man. You think for us as well as for the white man. You think
with us"--and he laid the first finger of his right hand against
the palm of his left, "<i>with</i> us."</p>

<p>"You want me to speak now not just as the agent here but as
your friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If I was not the agent, if I was only your friend and you
came and asked me what to do, I would say, <i>Keep still.</i>
Eight snows back I talked with Chief Buffalo Calf when he went to
look on at the gathering at Blackfoot Crossing. He told me he
thought, perhaps, he might find some medicine-sign that would
bring back the buffalo and send the white men away. There is no
such sign to be found."</p>

<p>"There is no sign to do that?"</p>

<p>"No. And all the half-breeds and all the Indians could only
make blood flow for no good end."</p>

<p>"More white men would come?"</p>

<p>"More would come."</p>

<p>"Good. It is as I thought." He was silent a minute or two and
Angus did not speak. Then, "This land is my mother," said Running
Antelope.</p>

<p>Angus did not smile, even inwardly. He had met Englishmen at
Calgary who were forever speaking of the <i>Mother Country</i>;
Germans he had met, years back, in Minnesota, who were forever
talking, and singing, of Fatherland.</p>

<p>After another pause Running Antelope spoke again.</p>

<p>"I do not want to see it red with blood for no good in the
end," he said.</p>

<p>He rose then. As he went out of the door something in his
back, blanket gathered round him, erect though he walked, stabbed
Angus with pity as, at times, a mere word of these people could
poignantly surprise him. "People of the stone age, born too
late," thought he.</p>

<p>He was thus thinking when the chief turned back. He had come
to the agency with much in his mind and had discussed it. He
turned back.</p>

<p>"Your heart is heavy," said he.</p>

<p>"I am troubled because of my woman," replied Angus. "The pains
are on her."</p>

<p>"I have seen that she is big with child. It will soon be
over."</p>

<p>"I have sent Mr. Chantelaine to High Butte," Angus said, "to
see if the doctor is there. With all this trouble he may be away.
She has no woman with her."</p>

<p>"Is her time due?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will bring my woman," said Running Antelope. "She has had
three of her own. If the child comes before my woman can get here
there is Red Head" (Macpherson). "He could help. I have seen him
with a cow and calf."</p>

<p>"O God!" exclaimed Angus.</p>

<p>It was dark when Running Antelope arrived in the buck-board of
which he was inordinately proud, his squaw with him smelling
strongly of agency soap and shining with cleanliness and
midwifely importance. Mr. Herbert Hodges had wished that his
homesick spouse might see the Indians as much like the gipsies by
the 'edges of England. Mrs. Running Antelope, surely to any eyes,
was somewhat like the midwives of Scotland!</p>

<p>She was all midwife. She took possession.</p>

<p>"I will stay here," said she, "until the child comes. It is
good for a man to let woman do all."</p>

<p>She went tremendously upstairs while the chief, with eyes upon
his horses at the door, aired his English.</p>

<p>"Mr. Macpherson," he said, "says I am to go to his tepee" (he
always called the agency houses <i>tepees</i>) "to sleep after I
have put buckboard and horse in stable. I think we will play
black-jack before we sleep. Maybe I skin him five, maybe ten,
dollars, ain't it?"</p>

<p>His wife came downstairs to say that hot water should be ready
on the stove. The odour of bar soap reassured Angus again. After
Running Antelope had made his offer to bring her and had ridden
away, he had remembered a sick woman, suffering from an abscess,
and how a medicine man had lanced it with a sharp flint--which
must have been dirty, for septic poisoning followed. He had
ardently hoped that if Chantelaine returned without the doctor
the old Indian woman might be hygienic in her midwifery. Her
clean smell and her request for constant hot water were
comforting.</p>

<p>Having tended the stove and filled all the kettles, he stole
up after her. She was sitting on a chair, by her bulk entirely
hiding it, beside the bed, attempting to cheer Fiona.</p>

<p>"It is nothing!" she declared. "When my last one was nearly
ready we were moving from one place here to one place there. We
were moving when the time came. I went into a bush beside a creek
and had the babee, and then followed my people with it. The
tepees were all up and the fires were lit, but I was in time for
supper."</p>

<p>Fiona began to laugh. She seemed slightly hysterical. Mrs.
Running Antelope looked at her in surprise, then supposed she was
laughing with delight at the ease of it all, and her look of
astonishment or affront turned to one of satisfaction at having
so thoroughly encouraged her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pains took Fiona again so that she moaned. Just
then there was a sound without and Chantelaine's voice. Angus
dashed from the room and downstairs. Another voice! Doctor
Tulloch of High Butte had arrived.</p>

<p>He took immediate control. He ordered Angus to keep out, young
though he was, very masterful and authoritative when assuming a
case. On the bottom step of the stairs the distraught husband sat
in agony, saying, "O God, O God!" Fiona screamed and he rushed
upstairs again, colliding with Mrs. Running Antelope. As she
bumped into him she demanded hot water, and together they hurried
down to the kitchen. Angus filled a jug for her, then as she went
away he attended to the kettle, saying again, "O God, O God!"
Back and forth he paced, listening. At last, hearing sounds
inexplicable, he went out to the foot of the stairs once more.
Mrs. Running Antelope appeared, tremendous on the landing.</p>

<p>"It's a boy," she said.</p>

<p>Angus crept into the room. There lay Fiona, it seemed to him
dead; but she opened her eyes and smiled at him, not only pain
showing on her face but a light of ecstasy. What had happened to
her had not been all unmitigated agony. At the bottom of the bed
lay a small exotic monkey, wrapped in flannel. He stared at it.
He gaped at the doctor. He tried to make private signs--elevating
his brows, then looking at that object, then back to Tulloch
again--mutely asking him what manner of creature had been born to
them.</p>

<p>"A fine, healthy boy!" said Tulloch, drying his hands
carefully. "I must go soon. I'm wanted back at High Butte
quickly. You have a great midwife here."</p>

<p>He turned to the Indian woman. He had a breezy manner of
self-confidence, or over-confidence, as one saw it. His
comportment gave some full assurance in his ability and made
others doubt it.</p>

<p>"What you don't know about obstetrics and gynecology," said
he, with a twinkle, "is hardly worth knowing."</p>

<p>She conceded him a small embarrassed laugh, and making hazard
that, "Oh--yesss!" would be satisfactory reply to give, gave it.
He chuckled, slapped her on her ample shoulder, wheeled for one
more look at Fiona and the armful of new life, then chucking his
chest as though he had done the whole thing, the stork of all
storks, marched from the room, Angus following him.</p>

<p>"You must have something to eat, Doc," he said.</p>

<p>"I will go over to Chantelaine," replied Tulloch, "and he will
drive me back. How are you feeling? Relieved, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Had pains in your tummy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did--now you mention it."</p>

<p>"Ho-ho!" the young medico shouted; and away he went, ho-hoing
with laughter over to Chantelaine's.</p>

<p>Angus went upstairs again. Fiona had the fine healthy boy (on
the doctor's word) in the crook of her arm.</p>

<p>"Kiss me," she said.</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her and then sat beside the bed holding
her hand.</p>

<p>"Isn't he lovely?" she sighed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Running Antelope, coming and going, was beaming with
midwifely content.</p>

<p>"I go to tell my man at Red Head's tepee," she said anon, "and
come back."</p>

<p>She left them alone. Fiona's eyes closed and she fell asleep
with that light of ecstasy on her face. Still Angus sat there.
Suddenly he heard a high, shrill ki-yi-ing of Indian voices. He
listened. They were drawing nearer. Over his loins cold ran. The
yells broke out again, high and shrill, as though learnt from
ululating coyotes in full chase. He loosened hold of his wife's
hand and, rising, went to the window.</p>

<p>A rub-a-dub of hoofs drummed outside. There came the riders,
befeathered and armed. Fiona, pale and staring, had wakened and
was calling him.</p>

<p>"I'm here, I'm here," he said. "It's all right. I'll go down
and see them."</p>

<p>There was a volley of firing.</p>

<p>"They have joined the rebels!" she moaned. "And after all you
have done for them, Angus. It may be dreadful. Where can we hide
baby?"</p>

<p>He ran downstairs, opened the door and stepped outside. The
house was encircled by Indians. Angus raised his face, imploring
to them. He would throw himself on their mercy. He would get in a
word. He would tell them he had once had a Cree woman (daughter
of a Cree chief and Stoney mother), he would tell them he had a
Cree son. He would tell them--</p>

<p>There was All Alone confronting him. He was evidently the
leader of this party. In answer to Angus's imploring gestures the
firing stopped, the circling of the painted horses was ended.
They joggled this way and that. The young chief dropped from the
saddle and, advancing to the agent, held out his hand. Angus
stared, then held out his.</p>

<p>"We have just heard your woman has a child. We have come to
say it makes our hearts glad," said All Alone.</p>

<p>Holding the hand of Minota's son, Angus looked at the
half-circle of braves before his door. The other half-circle from
the back came surging round the corner of the house to join their
fellows. All yelled again. At that moment Running Antelope
appeared, followed by his squaw thrusting a way between the
horses, Julius Caesar afoot to the rescue. "This is bad, this,"
he shouted. "It must be stopped. It may frighten the white
woman."</p>

<p>"I will go and tell her," said Angus. "This will put the day
into her heart."</p>

<p>He passed indoors and ran upstairs to Fiona's bedside. Cold
sweat was on her forehead.</p>

<p>"They came to congratulate you," he explained.</p>

<p>"To congratulate--oh!" and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>As he sat beside her, consoling her, he wished she knew
all--but the time was past, he considered, for telling her. He
could only hold her hand, linking his fingers with hers, as in
assurance of eternal unity.</p>

<p>His Indian son had come to congratulate him on the birth of
his white son: he was hurt that he could not share that secret
with Fiona. He looked down on her with adoration while outside
were the squelching sounds of horses' hoofs, and the little
tinkling of the small, round Hudson's Bay Company bells that some
had tied to the manes--a tinkling, a squelching, and occasional
subdued voices in the musical Cree as the painted braves, headed
by All Alone, rode away with little explosions of receding
laughter.</p>

<h1><a name="c25">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Changes</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The miserable business was over, Riel hanged, the snow of
another winter quaking down over the land, and Macpherson's chief
concern in life was whether it should be wheels or runners to
carry the wheat of those he called <i>our progressives</i> to the
grain elevators that had been erected by the side of the railway.
Those who drove the sledges, or wagons, as the case might be,
were proud of their duty. In an odd Indian fashion even the ones
who would not follow the example of the progressives--stumble
through the furrows at the plough-tail, sweat in the sun
stooking--watched these go with a sort of tribal pride. There,
they could raise wheat as well as the invaders!</p>

<p>From the gable window of the room in which Dan had been born a
year past, Angus watched the departure because, up there, could
be had a view over the coulee rim to south. The sky was emptied;
the sun was on the snow. A vision of the great northwest had once
come to him, a vision of a sea of grass (with scattered islands
of poplars and pines here and there), and, as though splashed by
a giant's hand across the leagues, the forts of Ellice and Pelly,
Pitt and Carlton, and a final sprinkling of Edmonton, St. Ann's,
Jasper, Rocky Mountain House. Another vision he had as he watched
the departure of the wheat sleighs from that window: from as far
north as Prince Albert the settlers would be making up their
parties to sledge the grain, putting on their fur-lined Mackinaw
coats, adjusting their fur caps for the trek. Parallel lines, so
went his fancy, were being streaked down the land, slowly moving
on to Brandon, Regina, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, Maple Creek,
Medicine Hat, to the tune of the jingling bells.</p>

<p>A movement to right caught his eye. The High Butte contingent
had evidently been of the same mind regarding the weather as
Macpherson. There they went, drawing their indigo trail through
the snow, small and distant puppets. He wondered by what belt of
sheltering woods they would <i>call it a day,</i> halt for the
night under the quaking plumes and shifting beams of the Aurora
Borealis.</p>

<p>Soon even that--the jingling trudge of the wheat sledges--or
at least over such distances, would be of the past, far sooner
than Peters, for instance, had imagined. For Peters had
<i>quit</i> the service. His girl could not marry the prairies,
the wild west, she wrote, and had found him a job in Toronto that
they might wed. By the time his successor, Norman Murray,
arrived, all the talk of the neighbourhood was of the new railway
to be built from Calgary to Edmonton.</p>

<p>Two missions, of different sects, were granted permission, by
Ottawa, to tend the souls of his people; and, out of the Indians'
private funds, with their entire approval, Angus had a hospital
built and a trained nurse installed. Soon one or two of the young
girls, on leaving the mission schools, went into training there.
Dr. Tulloch (who had brought Daniel into the world--with the
assistance of Mrs. Running Antelope) came over, appointed by
government to do so, every Sunday, and treated these neck sores
that were beginning to appear.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Angus became a secret grandfather:
a son, Peter, was born to All Alone and Tannisse. The custom of
taking a white man's, or white woman's, Christian name, and using
the name of the Indian father as surname was well established by
then. Thus it was Peter All Alone. In after years (granting the
survival of the race), interested genealogists would know that
the family surnames had originated in the middle and late years
of the nineteenth century. Only the mentally deficient among the
conquerors would giggle at them more than over many names of
their own people--Buffalo no more odd than Lamb, Sagebrush no
funnier than Greenwood, Duck no more to be derided than Swan!</p>

<p>Five years later, on one of the first trains to run on the
Calgary-Edmonton branch line, Fiona and Angus went south to
Calgary for the fun of it, like children with a new toy.</p>

<p>"All aboard!" the conductor intoned. Still a marine
implication! <i>Out of sight of land, prairie schooners, all
aboard!</i> On their last visit to the ranch in the High River
country it had seemed to them both that there was no physical
change in Mr. and Mrs. Fraser, the years light upon them. On this
visit they saw change. It was, as a matter of fact, a mellowing
of Ian that made them realize how the years fly. Genial he had
been all his life, live-and-let-live but, even so, in this
mellowness there was a suggestion of age. In Fiona's mother they
noted a new frailty, a manner as of handing over the world to any
who had the physical vivacity to be eager about it. They had
enlarged the original house since the addition by Hector and his
wife of two young people, a boy and a girl. Financially all went
well with them, their herds dotting the hills.</p>

<p>On the Munros' return they were driven out to the reserve in a
buggy hired at the <i>High Butte Livery Stables.</i> In tall
letters the name was painted on a false front over the doorway,
the wooden building standing with gable to the street in the
authentic manner of a frontier town of that period. High Butte!
It seemed to Angus that he must be ageing also as he looked at
the butte sharply outlined, seen at close range there, against a
golden sky. How many years ago was it that he had ridden,
parabola-fashion, along its shoulder for a last look--like Lot's
wife--at the west he was leaving of his own volition and yet
without pleasure?</p>

<p>"What are you dreaming of?" asked Fiona.</p>

<p>"Of the day I rode along there, coming east with Sam Douglas,
to see at Kildonan a wee lass but nine years old."</p>

<p>To her eyes came a tender light that hurt him because he had
been thinking also of Minota--and wished he had told her all
that, long since, he had decided she had better not know.</p>

<p>On the way they passed prairie schooner after prairie
schooner, many of them apparently at journey's end. They gave
<i>good day</i>, as the way was then, to the folk in these, once
or twice halting for a talk, hailed by a cry of: "How-do,
strangers! What's the hurry? Stop and have a cup of coffee."
Angus divided these immigrants in his mind (with his Indian kink)
into two classes. Sooner or later in the chats there would be
inquiry as to what he was about, driving through the land.</p>

<p>"Indian agent? Well, I got no use for the varmints. I left six
<i>good Indians</i> down on my place in Nebrasky. Yes. sir,
<i>good Indians</i>--down in the bottom of an old well
there."</p>

<p>"Indian agent? There's a reservation near here, then, is
there? Well, sir, that's good news. I don't know why it is but I
like them folks. Danged if I don't even like the smell of
them--wood-smoke, and the way they tan their deer-skins, and
maybe a whiff of sweet-grass in their tepees, or some of the
squaws with kind of sachets of herbs stuck inside their clothes.
Yes, sir, I'm darned if I don't like to see an Indian or two
around."</p>

<p>Already a community of Mennonites had come up from southern
Manitoba and settled to east of the reserve.</p>

<p>"Do you realize," said Angus to his wife, "that we are almost
an island now--the Mennonites to east, these Minnesota and
Nebraska farmers to west, cattlemen to south? It's no-man's land
only to north of us now."</p>

<p>The year young Dan started to ride to and from the settlement
school, five miles west of the reserve, the year Peter All Alone
went to the mission school, the No-Man's Land was suddenly
Doukhobour land in a possessive communal influx. The reserve was
islanded. <i>Many people</i> had come, indeed. By the following
winter there was no hauling of the wheat to the main line: by the
side of the track at High Butte station, on the Calgary-Edmonton
line, the tall grain elevators stood waiting.</p>

<p>"You must come down to the Burns' Nicht," Sam had said when
last he saw them, and he had written:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You must come out once in the winter anyhow to join
us--either at the Burns' Night or for the Bonspiel. We have a
grand Curling Rink now and a growing club, international,
irrespective of race, age, or religion! Our latest member is a
Cockney, a real-estate man, one Odges as he calls himself. He
said he had always thought that Curling was a Scotch game but
begins to think it is Scotch and Soda! Well, Burns' Night or
Bonspiel, but it must be one or the other . . ."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>For Fiona's sake Angus voted for Burns' Night if the weather
allowed passage.</p>

<p>Early in the month it looked as though it would be
<i>wheels</i> to go to High Butte station. There had been snow,
and then cold, the thermometer at twenty below zero, when
suddenly it rose to fifty above before a chinook wind that came
roaring out of the west, whipping over the trees in the coulee
bottoms like fishing-rods and melting the snow. That was three
days before the one on which they would be starting out, weather
permitting.</p>

<p>Then came snow again, but crisped to a point or two of frost.
So it was <i>runners.</i> In a two-horse sleigh, with hood and
windows, plenty of hay at their feet to keep them warm, they set
out. Angus looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>"I hae ma doots," said he, and asked one of the Indians what
the weather was going to do.</p>

<p>"Snow," was the reply.</p>

<p>There was a quiescence in the air, a feeling as of a lull
before some great occurrence. The horses were eager, but Angus
would not let them tire themselves, for they had far to go.</p>

<p>Sledges were part of the happiness of life to Fiona. To travel
when the snow was packed, travel behind rhythmic patter of hoofs
and jingle of bells, made her eyes sparkle as at seventeen. She
sat forward and looked down through the side window at a frill of
snow folding back from the runner like the scroll of foam at a
ship's bow, then tucked herself again in her rug.</p>

<p>Under gray sky they swung from the agency road to the road
that twined from that settlement where Dan had his first
schooling (in a one-room shack, presided over by a "school-marm"
to High Butte). Angus was glad to have got so far without trouble
of any kind. The quiescence was ominous. Suddenly the snow
foretold came, thicker, thicker. He had to unlatch and drop the
window before him to see, the driven flakes being like a white
plaster there. At once the whirling storm came into the
sleigh.</p>

<p>"Tuck yourself up," said he.</p>

<p>The horses went more slowly, labouring instead of restrained.
They reached a place where, from earlier falls, there had been
drifts. There the team dragged strenuously, puffing white gusts
of breath into the rising blizzard.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we got here before <i>this</i> started," remarked
Angus.</p>

<p>"Where's the road?"</p>

<p>"They'll have to find it," replied Angus. "That's why I'm glad
we got this length. Off the road nearer home, and given their
heads, they'd just turn and go back. They know now where we are
going."</p>

<p>The snow increased in volume. He could hardly see the horses'
ears. They picked up speed again, straining into the collars, the
muscles of their haunches sliding under the skin in unison so
violently that they dislodged the coat of snow on them. It
slipped off in layers.</p>

<p>"They want to get to the end," observed Fiona.</p>

<p>She had hardly spoken when they halted.</p>

<p>"Giddap!"</p>

<p>They refused.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there!" a voice hailed.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" shouted Angus, opening the door beside him.</p>

<p>"Where do you think you are going?" the voice called.</p>

<p>"High Butte. Why?"</p>

<p>"You're there!"</p>

<p>The horses wheeled so abruptly that the sledge canted like a
careening boat, wheeled, charged through drifts ahead, and there
was the gray loom of the High Butte livery stable.</p>

<p>In relief Fiona laughed.</p>

<p>"We'll never forget these days," she said. "Great life!"</p>

<p>No, they would never forget them. In the morning a snow-plough
cleared the track, its rotating nozzle throwing fountains to
either side, fountains that twinkled with rainbow colours in the
sun.</p>

<p>The weather had permitted, changeable though it was, and there
they were in the private "banquet room" of the Alberta Hotel,
reading the place-cards on the table, each with a verse of Burns
on it. Soon a parson was saying grace:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some hae meat and canna eat,<br>
 And some would eat that want it;<br>
 But we hae meat and we can eat,<br>
 Sae let the Lord be thankit."</p>

<p> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two pipers came in marching, swaying, piping, and behind them
was a beaming Chinaman--Sam's own "butler" as he called
him--keeping step with them and holding high in air the platter
of haggis. Sam called on Tam Somebody (neither Angus nor Fiona
caught the name) to give the haggis its address. Up rose Tam,
with a wave of his hand to the dish.</p>

<p>"'Wee, sleekit, cow'rin', tim'rous beastie . . .'" he
began.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter sounded and Mrs. Tam--there was no doubt
about it being she--looked embarrassed round her and sadly at her
husband.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat and started again:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,<br>
Great chieftain o' the puddin'-race . . .'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Later, all the toasts drunk, the trestle tables were carried
away and the evening progressed to the part Fiona liked. Round
the sides of the long room while the tables were being removed
the groups clustered in a buzz of talk. Then, from a throne at
the end, came the sound of fiddles tuning up, little premonitory
scrapes and pluckings. It was old Red River days again for
Fiona.</p>

<p><i>First lady and first gentleman, balance; first lady and
first gentleman, take hands; first couple down the line,</i> and
wildly went the fiddles; <i>next, follow suit,</i> and merrily
went the fiddles. Gaily they danced in the old Alberta Hotel the
dances of an earlier home whence some had themselves come, or
whence their parents or grandparents had come: strathspeys, reels
(and Red River jig), Highland flings, schottische, lancers,
petronella. And <i>Hooch! Hooch!</i> they cried as the night wore
on.</p>

<p>Going bedwards in the wee sma' hours along a corridor, Fiona
paused and raised a finger to Angus in a sign for him to listen.
Through an open transom they heard a man speaking.</p>

<p>"I'm as fou as I can haud," he announced, "and I can haud nae
mair."</p>

<p>"I ken fine," a woman's voice replied. "And early ye began. Ye
was addressing the wee mouse instead of the haggis."</p>

<p>"I only did that tae enliven the proceedings."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tam!"</p>

<p>"Weel, ye are no going to be hypocreetical, are ye? Burns
wouldna hae minded!"</p>

<p>They moved on to their own door, that discussion following
them.</p>

<p>Before going home next morning, while Fiona was doing some
shopping, Angus called in at the office of Herbert Hodges,
real-estate agent.</p>

<p>"Yes, I 'ad to come back," said Hodges. "Even the missus got
that way. We went 'ome, you know. I quit the service. That new
reserve wasn't to her mind. But she got 'omesick to come back and
I can assure you Barkis was willing. If we had just waited out
here what we might have been! Millionaires!"</p>

<p>At that moment entered Mrs. Hodges, to whom Angus was at once
introduced. She, too, was shopping and had just come in for some
more money.</p>

<p>"Delighted to meet you, Mr. Munro," she said. "I've heard of
you from my 'usband. Oh, that was a lonely plice up there but I
like it here now we are back. Somethink in the old life I
couldn't abide when we went 'ome. We held it down awhile and then
just had to come out again. Funny thing, you know. Our young
people like it here, too. In summer we drive up to the mountains
and, d'you know, Mr. Munro, there are forests there just put you
in mind of Epping Forest. Have you ever been in the
mountains?"</p>

<p>"Yes--yes, indeed," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"You've seen them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"The young people," remarked Hodges, laughing, "tell her she'd
know if it was Epping Forest if she got a slap from a bear--to
teach her respect."</p>

<p>She smiled pleasantly at that.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see it all from the 'otel veranda," she explained. "You
can see everythink from there without having to go walking and
climbing. I'm not <i>greatly impressed</i> by mountaineering. But
I like living here now. Jack's as good as 'is master 'ere."</p>

<p>"Quite. Yes," said Angus, "and the master as good as Jack.
It's a man's own character that counts."</p>

<p>"Well, er--oh, yes, I see what you mean," but she looked
somewhat combatively at him, with a flash in her eyes. Then,
drooping her eyelids, she examined him, up and down, became a
little frigid, almost condescending. "Well, I'm pleased to have
met you, I'm sure, Mr. Munro. My 'usband often talked of you and
wondered how you were getting on in that outlandish place, and if
your poor wife could put up with it. Of course, being newly
married in those days, she might for her husband's sake, as I
said to 'Erbert when he told me about you. And the dreadful
Indians! I suppose it's all according. Some people don't mind.
Some people are brought up to it, raised, as they say 'ere. I do
so 'ate to 'ear slang. But this is a real city, and we could
never go back 'ome but on a visit. You 'ardly ever see an Indian
here now except on special occasions when they come in dressed up
in their old rubbish. I must be going. De-lighted to 'ave met
you, Mr. Munro."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hodges, after she had gone back to her shopping,
and after a series of nervous little throat clearings, "it's good
to be back. But if we had never gone we might have been
millionaires now. Look at Mr. Douglas. He believed in the country
and he's the wealthiest man 'ere--and no side to him. Calls me
'Erbert and I call him Sam."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam Douglas is very--"</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've known him some years."</p>

<p>"Well, fancy you knowing Sam Douglas! 'Ow did you get to know
him?"</p>

<p>Angus made no reply and Mr. Hodges hurried on.</p>

<p>"It was kind of you to look me up, Mr. Munro," he said. "Good
luck to you, good luck to you! Any time you have any money to
invest in real estate, delighted to advise," and he waved a hand
in cordial farewell.</p>

<h1>Descendants</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>As the years passed, Daniel's progress was gratifying to both
mother and father. Before his settlement school days were over,
despite his outdoor enthusiasms, his handling of horses, Angus
and Fiona decided he would not end his education when he passed
out of High School. Munro himself had always been a reader. Two
walls of the sitting-room were book-shelves from floor to
ceiling, and always there was a space in them somewhere that
signified Dan had a book out.</p>

<p>A second child was added to All Alone and his wife Tannisse, a
daughter this time, christened Louise. Peter, the elder child,
Angus was told, was one of the ninety per cent who (in an old
phrase of the land) <i>go back to the blanket.</i> But, at least,
having learnt English at the mission, he did not refuse to speak
it. It was not always, by the way, stubbornness, Angus suspected,
that caused an Indian who knew English not to talk it.
Diffidence, shyness, he believed, as often--perhaps more
often--was the cause. Nor did Peter spend his time, school over,
in riding aimlessly about the reserve, like some of the boys. He
worked with his father in the fields. Macpherson reported him
keen on cattle and not averse to a plough, which was much to be
thankful for.</p>

<p>When Dan went to High School in Calgary, living there with a
family advised by Lovat Douglas, school reports and reference to
him in letters from Sam (who had, as he wrote, <i>an eye on the
lad</i>) were very pleasing. Home for the holidays at the end of
his first term, he inquired, "Do you know what I'd like to be,
Dad?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A doctor."</p>

<p>"A doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's a first-aid class I've joined. I can't
understand why everyone doesn't learn it. One ought to have that
knowledge anyhow--never know where you'll be. Suppose there was
an accident and you couldn't do a thing, or somebody was sick and
you knew no more than the lily-white hand on the fevered brow.
It's fascinating, too."</p>

<p>Angus became more and more business advisor for the band. The
cattlemen to south, because of the barbed-wire having come into
use, were in jeopardy. Their steers, drifting in winter before
blizzards, were held by the wire and "frozen on the hoof," as a
rancher who called at the office put it.</p>

<p>"It's a darned queer thing to think of," said he. "When I
started here we had our spring round-up that carried us plumb
down into Montana and not a strand of that Goddamned barbed-wire
all the way. We got back home with the branded calves, had a
little smoke and a rest, and it was time then for the beef
round-up and drive. When we got through that there was another
year shot. But no barbed-wire. How's the chances, Mr. Agent, for
a deal for grazing rights on some of the reserve land? They ain't
using it all."</p>

<p>'"I think," replied Angus, "the chances are good if we can
arrange terms."</p>

<p>Many of his Indians were already self-supporting. Here was
opportunity toward fruition of a dream he had of a larger tribal
fund. With Running Antelope (who, in the passing years, had come
to look more like Rameses II, mummified, than Julius Caesar,
though straight as ever in the spine), with Tall Whirlwind and
All Alone he discussed the matter. Ottawa was willing. It was at
his discretion in his knowledge of conditions. Yes, they were
willing also. They were eager, indeed. They would leave the
matter of price to him, for he thought <i>with</i> them.</p>

<p>Changes, changes! The steers of the cattlemen grazed on the
spare part of the reserve unmolested, no more the Redcoats coming
to look for evidence of Grand Larceny of Live Stock by Angus's
wards, and sub-chief Big Beaver (gone these years) the picture of
unbelief that a Cree could pilfer so much as a hair of a
steer.</p>

<p>All Alone's first son was but a year younger than Dan. The
little girl, Louise, would soon be going to school. It looked as
if there were but to be the two from that union but after a lapse
of some years came another boy.</p>

<p>Few of the women could brook a doctor interfering at a
delivery, but All Alone was proudly <i>progressive</i>, all
Indian though he believed himself to be. What a white woman had,
his woman would have; and so he drove Tannisse to the hospital,
then went off to High Butte for Dr. Tulloch.</p>

<p>"Well," reported the doctor to Angus, "Mrs. All Alone had an
easy time--just like shelling peas."</p>

<p>"Healthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. No tuberculosis in that family, but I must say the small
son who has arrived does have a sort of white cast. No imputation
suggested on the lady! Probably each generation, getting more
civilized, will display an increasingly European and decreasingly
Amerindian cranium."</p>

<p>That view seemed as much and as little authoritative as that
of Buffalo Calf on the subject of race, but Angus had other
considerations apart from the reasonableness or unreasonableness
of it.</p>

<p>"Peter should be rechristened <i>Beginning</i>," remarked
Chantelaine, hearing the news, "and this last one
<i>End</i>."</p>

<p>Not only the changes in the land told of the flight of time.
The arrival of this third (secret) grandchild--for whom he might
be able to do something--gave Angus thoughts to that tune. The
child was named after him by the proud parents. Fiona was
delighted by the compliment. To Angus it increased the burden of
his secret life.</p>

<p>The growth of Dan--physical and mental--was the chief cause
for his considerations that the years were flying. His wife
seemed to him as youthful-looking as when they married--which was
absurd, no doubt, but his view. Only the other day, it seemed to
him, All Alone had come to the agency with a gift <i>for little
boy</i> that Tannisse had been busy upon--a play-tepee not five
feet high. It had been set up beside the house; and here was Dan
long since grown beyond it and off to his second term in
Calgary.</p>

<p>Sam Douglas, coming up in the autumn to the agency house for
the duck-shooting, was full of sincere if slightly oratorical
admiration for young Dan. The sight of High Butte took his mind
also back to old days. All his dreams had come true except the
first of which Angus had heard. No, he had not bothered about
coal.</p>

<p>"Man, man," said he, "coal! That takes me back a way, back to
the Missouri where I heard of the burning rocks and thought I was
on to something wonderful."</p>

<p>He had taken a jump ahead of that. Natural gas was his latest
and more profitable interest. There was a reservoir of it under
Medicine Hat and he was sure others would be found elsewhere. But
still he was prophesying. He believed there was petroleum
somewhere under that earth that had for &aelig;ons been only
buffalo pasture. He was chairman of this, chairman of that,
director, or president, of this, that and the other--such as
<i>Great Northwest Hail Insurance</i> and the <i>S. D. Wheat
Pool.</i> The <i>Transport and Haulage</i> business he had
sold.</p>

<p>To Angus he did not seem to be happy. There was the sound of a
flaw when one tapped: he did not ring true. There was
disappointment lurking in him, as of a man who had got to the
rainbow's end and found the holding of the crock in his hands
less elating than the quest for it. Still he must quest.</p>

<p>"Petroleum! Aye, I believe in petroleum!" he exclaimed, and
nudged Angus in the midriff with an elbow, sitting under the
cotton poplars by the house gable, cleaning his shot-gun. But
even that note of elation, and the nudge, were as of one playing
a part. He went away laden with ducks and saying, "Grand to have
seen you again, Angus. It's wonderful to see old faces, old
friends again."</p>

<p>Fiona felt a vague sense of pity for him when he was gone.</p>

<p>"Why I should feel it," she said, "I have no foggiest idea. He
has everything."</p>

<p>They saw him again--and Dan--sooner than they expected.</p>

<p>For fun they had taken their first trip out of the country on
the new railway-spur years ago. For this, that and the other
cause--Burns Nights, holiday visits, they had, since then, often
travelled on that line. At a sudden call from Ian they went again
to High River in anxiety. Mrs. Fraser had been taken suddenly
ill, the telegram said, and the doctor thought that any relatives
should be advised. All the way they had the wonder, in common, if
she was already gone--Angus conjecturing that perhaps she was
dead when the wire was sent to them, and Fiona feeling
(foolishly, no doubt, as life goes, yet this was her emotion at
the time) that she had been selfish ever to leave her mother, and
thanking God that her father, Hector, and Hector's wife, were
with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fraser was gone by the time they arrived, had indeed been
gone when the telegram was despatched to them, as later they
heard, it being couched as it was on the advice of the doctor
who, out of experience and pity, would temper shock. That sense
of touching some other life not understood in this one was in all
their hearts at High River, so that even the sound of the running
stream by the door was different for awhile, and the sighing of
the little winds trooping through the pines that topped the
gray-green hummocks there was as a sigh out of eternity into
time. All were old enough to know it had to come to them some day
and she had not died in pain. For that they were grateful. After
the funeral Fiona stayed at the ranch, arranging to follow Angus
later.</p>

<p>Stopping on the way back at Calgary to do some duties for his
father-in-law, Angus found that there was talk of nothing but the
Boer War. Nobody seemed to have a clear idea of what it was all
about--nor to care. Britain was at war: that sufficed--and that
war, anyhow, is good adventure was the froth atop the
crowd-emotion there.</p>

<p>His morning offices seen to, Munro lunched with Sam Lovat
Douglas, having arranged to see Dan in the afternoon when school
was over. Sam expressed himself very sorry to hear the news of
Mrs. Fraser, but repeated several times, consolatory. "All got to
come to it." After a decent pause he mentioned that he had been
over in the old country for some months and was engaged to be
married--<i>me, man, confirmed bachelor!</i>--to an old friend,
of place and property, Angus gathered.</p>

<p>"Will you be going back there to live?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, no. At least, she's coming to see how she likes it here."
He glanced at a leaflet on the wall. "Look at that," he said.
"Paderewski is coming to play in Calgary on his tour. She'll be
all right. And look at the grand library they are making here
now. Man, it's wonderful. Aye, it's time for me to marry and
settle."</p>

<p>Lunch over, they sat in the hotel rotunda, where the easy
chairs stood in files facing the street, like a grandstand to
view the passersby. As they smoked and chatted round them were
excited and boisterous young men, discussing the war and
recruiting. A hilarious group surged in, and others sitting there
hailed them. They had been, they announced--everybody listening,
as the conversation seemed common property--to a test for
recruits for Strathcona's Horse.</p>

<p>Colonel Steele said to one of the fellows, 'Where have I seen
you before?' and he answered, 'I don't know.' But Steele looked
at him awhile and then said, 'I've got it!' It was a fellow who
had been convicted some time back for horse-stealing. Some of
those who were standing near heard the colonel remark, 'Well,
we'll not lack for horses if we have you along!'</p>

<p>Into the hotel came an urgent, red-faced young man who dashed
up to the group.</p>

<p>"Here," he began, telescoping his words. "I can ride anything
with hair on it. When they put down the rows of saddles in front
of the horses today, and we all lined up, and they told us
<i>When the bugle blows, saddle and mount,</i> I was one of the
first at my horse. And there was no bluidy bookle on the
belly-band, and the belly-band was split in two!"</p>

<p>Those he addressed shouted with joy at that description of the
cinch.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" inquired one, a six-footer with
bright eyes, full of fight and bonhomie--an odd blend.</p>

<p>"From all over the place, and wanting to see more of it,"
replied the newcomer. "Born in Yorkshire, been in New Zealand and
Australia--Queensland. Worked my passage to British Columbia.
It's all the same--work everywhere, hard, bluidy work. Goom trees
and your swag in Queensland, pine trees and your blanket-roll in
B.C. And here's a chance for me to see South Africa if it wasn't
for the lack of that bluidy bookle!"</p>

<p>"Say, you come along with me," said the six-footer, "and I'll
elucidate for you the mystery of cinch and latigo while you wait.
Then you pop on the train and get down to Moose Jaw. I hear they
haven't got all their number there yet."</p>

<p>"That's the speerit, that's the speerit!" exclaimed Sam. "I'll
tell that little story in my speech tonight. I'm slated to
address a meeting. 'Ladies and gentlemen, in this hour when the
mother calls the children answer.' I've a grand end to it: <i>one
flag, one empire.</i> That's sure to get them. I'll tell that
little story--how the young men rally."</p>

<p>"To see South Africa," said Angus.</p>

<p>Sam's head turned slowly. He looked at his friend gloomily.
Then he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"Man, it's grand to have seen you--grand to have had a crack
again. I'll have to be running. I have work to attend to."</p>

<br>
<h1>Business</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>About a week after Angus's return to the agency, Fiona wrote a
suggestion: Did he not think she should come back and bring her
father with her? It appeared that the old man brooded at the
ranch. She thought a change might do him good. So Ian
Fraser--looking his years then--came home with her.</p>

<p>He had the manner of not wanting to give trouble, of one
thinking he might be <i>in the way</i> rather than of one wanting
to be left alone, and in his eyes was an odd dreaming dullness
that gave the impression he no longer looked forward but
backward. Anon, however, as with an effort at first, he began to
join in their talks. Young Daniel brought him out of himself more
than either Angus or Fiona.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to be, son?" he asked him once.</p>

<p>Dan told him of his ambition, and he seemed to approve of it.
When the lad went back to high school the old man thought it
perhaps time for him to be returning to the ranch.</p>

<p>"Better stay a bit now that Dan is gone again," suggested
Angus. "Fiona is always lonely without him."</p>

<p>"Yes, the house is quiet without the boy."</p>

<p>"Why not make your home here?" said Angus. "Don't you like the
place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it fine. I like it fine. I can see the mountains
from here and I can see the plains. I have all I want--all I
want," and a sadness came to his eyes as though, truly, he had
not. He sat back in his chair and began that gentle humming,
characteristic of him.</p>

<p>Thus it was that he made his home there, though on the next
summer they all visited the High River ranch together, picking up
Dan on the way. In the Autumn of that year Fraser had a slight
stroke, but soon recovered.</p>

<p>"It's nothing very serious," Dr. Tullock told them. "He's of
an age for it. He's just got to go easy, that's all."</p>

<p>He went easy. All the evidence, facially, of his stroke was a
slight muscular constriction of one jaw, not noticeable except to
intimates who knew him of old, when the face was in repose. When
he laughed the two sides did not equally participate, but
strangers might have thought it was but a mannerism of his--a
lop-sided smile. A dullness in one of his legs troubled him more
and made him take to using a stick--a <i>cane</i>, as all
walking-sticks were called. In summer he sat much on the veranda,
where he could see the play of the shadows of the cluster of
poplars that stood by the gable and hear their rustling. Indoors,
Fiona would hear him lilting to himself and the tap-tap of his
stick keeping time. He had a second stroke in the following
winter and slipped away. As long after as the next summer Fiona,
in absent mood, would sometimes hear the tap of his stick keeping
time to his singing, and then come back to the present. That year
an offer regarding his wards came to Angus, an offer that a few
years earlier he might have listened to but at that time
rejected.</p>

<p>Into the office one day came the three chiefs for a
conference. A white man had been on the reserve talking to them,
they said, wanting them to sell a parcel of land, a strip at the
east side. They filled their pipes. The blent odour of tobacco
and kinick-kinick was in the room.</p>

<p>"Well," said Angus, taking from a drawer his black
book--larger and of a larger content than the black book of the
Ettrick brothers', "a few years ago it might have been different.
You know it yourselves: it looked as if you were dying out. But
you have steadied. And you've got to think of your children's
children. One must think of one's children." Three grunts came in
response to that. "Suppose," Angus continued, "that in another
generation or two you increased in numbers and wanted more
land--you'd have to buy then if you sell now. With whites all
round you that would divide the band. You'd have to buy somewhere
else. Now that you've steadied you may increase." The chiefs
smoked quietly, hunched forward, eyes on the floor in the Indian
manner when listening.</p>

<p>"No, I certainly would not advise you to sell," said Angus,
and he threw down on the table a paper-cutter he had taken
up.</p>

<p>The three Indians raised their heads. They knew that little
mannerism. It was his way of saying, <i>I have finished.</i> They
rose. The business was over. They moved to the door with a faint
scliff of moccasined feet. There was no <i>good day</i>, but he,
rising with them and standing at the door, laid a hand for a
moment on the shoulder of the last to go out--All Alone--who
looked back at him with a smile. He had come to love this agent.
He remembered his first meeting with him, and how he had lifted
his hands in the sign of blessing.</p>

<p>There was a swish of saddle leather, the creak of buggy
wheels, Running Antelope, stiffening with rheumatism, preferring
driving to riding.</p>

<p>Angus stepped back into his office, dense with the smoke they
had left, and opened the window wider. The blue haze whirled
about in the room in ribands and fluttered into the open air.</p>

<p>"All the same," said he to himself, "the man had no right to
go jinking over the reserve and sounding them before coming to
me."</p>

<p>Three days later the jinker arrived. In the morning one of the
missionaries had called at nine to lodge a complaint against the
other. At ten the other had called to make a report against the
one--"I think this comes within your province, Mr. Munro." Angus
was learning. He said to the second, as to the first, "Well,
that's too bad. I'll see what I can do," and thought no more
about it. He spent much time trying to make brotherly love
continue between these two. When the second, in his turn, had
departed, there was a sound in the room, faint but insistent in
the office corners.</p>

<p>Angus opened the door again. Yes, it was the unremitting pulse
of drums. Mennonites to east of them, Doukhobours to north, all
sorts and agnostics to south, and the same to west--well, why not
the drums also in some ritual of their own observance?</p>

<p>Thus, right or wrong, he mused, and stood there with folded
arms, his body rising and falling lightly in time with the
distant, far-carried thud, thud, thud. As he was standing so
there whirled up to the steps a buggy from the <i>High Butte
Livery Stable</i> and a personage--surely a personage he would
have been in the eyes of William Ettrick--stepped down, the
vehicle oscillating on its springs, relieved of him.</p>

<p>"Is the agent around?" asked this stranger, removing a large
cigar from a large mouth.</p>

<p>"I am the agent," answered Angus.</p>

<p>"Could I have a word with you?"</p>

<p>"Surely. Come right in."</p>

<p>Angus, pointing to a seat before the desk, watched his large
visitor subside.</p>

<p>"I am Walter Crank Barlow," began the personage.</p>

<p>"How do you do? Munro is my name."</p>

<p>"Well, I've been talking to some of your Indians here," said
Mr. Barlow, "about a purchase I want to make of a piece of land
at the east side of their reserve."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was you."</p>

<p>"It was I? What do you mean?" and Mr. Barlow flicked ash onto
the floor.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," murmured Angus, setting an ash-tray before his
caller.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'It was I?'"</p>

<p>"They mentioned to me that a white man had come to the reserve
and talked to them about that," explained Angus.</p>

<p>"They did."</p>

<p>"Yes. I could not understand why he had not come to me first.
I am glad to see you here now."</p>

<p>"Well, here I am, Mr.--ah--Munro. I hope we may be able to fix
up the matter. The Indians said they would think it over."</p>

<p>"Quite. I have discussed it with them and I have advised
against it,"</p>

<p>"Against it!" ejaculated Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why that?"</p>

<p>"I can give you the reason," replied Angus. "There is a
steadying of their numbers now. They may increase. We are now
almost surrounded by white settlers. They may need, for
themselves, all that land."</p>

<p>"I doubt it, I doubt it! I think it is a short-sighted policy
on your part. You can afford to rent some of the reserve as
grazing lands, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. If a strip was sold it would mean having to lose
that income. The Indians might need all for their own stock
eventually. And I think, for the time being, the rentals are
better for them."</p>

<p>"I think the heads of your department would not agree with
you," said Barlow.</p>

<p>"If you have an offer to make," replied Angus, "I can
communicate it to the department."</p>

<p>"Along with your advice against it--heh?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Well, personally I think they are a vanishing race, and it
should be your part on their behalf to do the best for them--on
their behalf, I repeat, instead of just leasing to the
cattlemen," and he gave a look at once shrewd and insolent.</p>

<p>Angus did not like it. Though with no guilty conscience
(needless to say) that look was to him of a man who would suggest
that he got what was called a <i>rake-off</i> from the ranchers.
A sudden rage took him and he wanted to wring this person's
neck.</p>

<p>"If you have an offer to make you might make it in writing,"
he said, quietly, "and I shall forward it to the department,
although personally I advise--whatever the price--no
surrender."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, 'No surrender'?"</p>

<p>"It is the department word for a sale of land by the Indians,"
Angus replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Well, of course, seeing how you feel I'm willing
to meet you. You are not, I suppose, in the service for your
health!"</p>

<p>Angus frowned, produced his pipe slowly, and filled it. Mr.
Barlow misread the scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I am willing," said he, "to put the matter on a business
basis between ourselves. I am willing to do it--let's say--on a
commission basis. If you can use your influence to get the
Indians to agree and the department to agree, I'd be willing to
arrange a commission basis for you."</p>

<p>Angus drew a deep breath. He rose, and then suddenly had a
quaint memory. He was for a moment in his old cabin in the
forests beyond Jasper House, and in his hand was a blue jay dead.
Having risen to kill the man he did not sit down again.</p>

<p>"I have already told you, sir," he said, stepping to the door,
"I am entirely against any surrender of lands on the
reserve."</p>

<p><i>Deep</i>, thought Mr. Barlow, <i>deep.</i></p>

<p>"But you would, perhaps, see your way," he suggested,
telescoping the words in his anxiety, "to reconsider that opinion
for a sound commission--a worthwhile commission, say twenty-five
per cent of the price agreed upon?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Barlow," said Angus, "will you get to hell out of
here!"</p>

<p>There! He wanted to be civilized--but that was how it
ended.</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow rose, ash from his cigar falling all over his
clothes.</p>

<p>"You will hear more of this," he vowed. "I have influence. I
can pull wires. I have political pull. I can fix you!"</p>

<p>"I'll fix you," replied Angus, "so that you will be carried
out of here if you don't walk out quickly."</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow did not step to the door by which he had entered,
the handle of which was between the agent's fingers. He stepped
out into the main office, the door of which was just
ajar--either, despite his weight, in dread of coming close to
Angus or, in the flurry of the moment, hardly aware of his steps
and thinking that there was another exit. Seeing Chantelaine and
Murray hooked there over their ledgers--</p>

<p>"I have witnesses!" he exclaimed. "I call these men to
witness. You hear that, sir?" and he addressed himself to
Chantelaine. "I call you to witness I was threatened!"</p>

<p>Nigel paid no heed, left hand running down the columns of an
account-book on his desk, right hand holding a pen poised in air.
He made an entry, then looked round.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" shouted Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>"Pardon," said Chantelaine. "I am a little deaf."</p>

<p>"A little deaf!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dull of hearing. When a voice is pitched very high," he
went on with charming amiability, pivoting slightly on his stool
to face Mr. Barlow, "I miss it--as some people can't catch the
highest notes of a bat."</p>

<p>"Oh! So the staff takes after the chief, heh? Well, we'll
see."</p>

<p>Murray, at his desk, was quaking with mirth. Barlow shot a
look at that heaving back, and tramping across the office stepped
outside.</p>

<p>"Don't slam the door," called Murray.</p>

<p>The door slammed and through a window they saw the personage
drag the well-sprung buggy to one side as he climbed aboard,
almost as though he would upset it. He took his seat violently
beside the driver.</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Chantelaine, with that slight French accent
that he had inherited, "too bad. There's only our Union Jack to
wave him good-bye."</p>

<p>"He called us to witness, indeet!" snorted Murray. "We are
witnesses also to his venal and immoral suggestions. Wires or no
wires, he dare not pull them. We can witness more than that you
threatened him! He has the voice of a bull and I think the soul
of a worrm!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>They saw then All Alone and Tannisse drive to the door. The
canvas of a tepee showed behind the seat, and to the side of the
rig lodge-poles had been lashed, their ends thrusting out behind.
All Alone handed the lines to his wife and alighted.</p>

<p>The three in the office continued to discuss the recent
visitor. They heard All Alone go into Angus's private room.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him to come in here?" asked Murray.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This way, Chief!" hailed Murray in the connecting doorway,
then stepped back to lean against his high desk again.</p>

<p>All Alone entered, wrapped in a gorgeous blanket. On his feet
were heavily beaded moccasins; an eagle feather stood upright
behind his head from the braided scalp-lock. He carried a pair of
polished buffalo horns.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the Indian!" exclaimed Chantelaine.</p>

<p>They were good friends, these two. Chantelaine had some
Cree--more than pidgin-Cree--but Murray had none, so in the outer
office All Alone always spoke English.</p>

<p>"Heap good Injun," he replied, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Where are we off to?" asked Angus.</p>

<p>"Medicine Hat," said All Alone. "I have brought you this pair
of buffalo horns, Mr. Munro."</p>

<p>"They are beauties. That's nice of you, All Alone," and Angus
took them in his hand. "Where did you get them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lying around, lying around."</p>

<p>"You polished them?"</p>

<p>"No, no. The big chief does the hunting. The squaw does the
polishing--and the chief helps her a bit," and he laughed again.
"I've got some more out there. You-all should come out and see
them. Got over a dozen."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"Tourists," said All Alone.</p>

<p>At that Murray bellowed with mirth, slapping his leg, and
Chantelaine pivoted on his high stool chuckling gaily. Angus
considered his son thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said All Alone. "When the train stops at Medicine Hat
the people have time to get out and walk up and down a little.
They see me with buffalo horns. They say <i>Oh, look at the
Indian</i> I do nothing. They come along and say <i>Buffalo
horns?</i> I grunt. They say, <i>How much, you sell?</i> I hold
up three fingers. Sometimes they give three dollars, sometimes
they say <i>too much! I give you two,</i> and they hold up two
fingers to me. I grunt, and give them the horns. Two
dollars."</p>

<p>Chantelaine, humped on his stool, grinned admiringly. Murray,
leaning against his desk, jerked his head back and laughed
afresh. Angus gave a tight-lipped smile, holding the horns in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they say, <i>Oh, give him three--the poor people
used once to hunt the buffalo.</i> Then I go to my woman and get
another pair out of the basket she sits on. If they see too many
all at once they think not so much of them."</p>

<p>It was Angus who laughed deep in his chest at that. It was a
stratagem of Rocky Mountain House when the Indians came into the
trade-room. As a party entered only a small stock was visible.
When the trade was done those who went out had to show the
curious ones what they had got. To display much stock might
create the impression of superfluity. Scarce and of value: that
was the scheme of limiting the display.</p>

<p>"These horns should go up over the door," said Murray. He
dragged a stool to the entrance to the private office and climbed
on it. "Let me hold them up here for you, Mr. Munro, to see how
they look."</p>

<p>Angus renounced them.</p>

<p>"There--how about that?" asked Murray.</p>

<p>"Little lower," advised Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"There eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They'd be all right there," said Angus,
half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"Maybe where you can see when you sit in your room," suggested
All Alone.</p>

<p>"Yes, in your own room," agreed Murray, jumping down.</p>

<p>"Maybe in your room where you sit in house," said All
Alone.</p>

<p>"I'll take them over and show them to my wife, anyhow," said
Angus, and Murray gave them back to him.</p>

<p>"Come out and see," said All Alone.</p>

<p>They filed after him. Tannisse, no longer a slip of a girl,
growing broad and plump, was wrapped in a bright shawl, a bandana
round her head. She smiled a welcome to them.</p>

<p>"Where are the horns?" asked Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"In basket. I show you," and Tannisse leant back to raise the
lid.</p>

<p>"Nice polish," observed Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"Yes, nice polish," agreed Murray.</p>

<p>"Yes, nice polish," said she.</p>

<p>All Alone took out a pair--and posed. He stood statuesque,
horns in hand, expression blank, from beaded moccasins to the
erect eagle feather (that added to his height) splendid for a
painter's eyes. Then he held up a hand, three fingers raised.</p>

<p>"Oh, too much!" declared Chantelaine, entering into the spirit
of the thing. "Two--"</p>

<p>This was humour to delight, extremely, Mrs. All Alone. She
rippled a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"All a-board!" cried out Chantelaine.</p>

<p>All Alone stepped to the wagon, grinning, put the horns of his
exhibition back into the basket and climbed to his seat.</p>

<p>Away they gritted, the fine dry summer soil pouring over the
wheel-rims between the spokes. A foal of one of the mares that
had been frisking nearby during the halt cavorted and went
stilting along beside its dam. A dog that had been lying in the
shadow below the rig, and when it started had just risen to
patter between the wheels, slithered out from the dust. Foal to
one side, dog to the other, away they went trailing their powdery
pennant. The three white men watched the departure, somehow
fascinated by the picture, often though they had seen the like,
watched the rig dwindle up to the coulee-rim, show large there,
All Alone and his squaw side by side against the fine beaten blue
metal that was that day's sky, and then dip from sight followed
by a dropping flutter of dust.</p>

<p>"Indian from the heels up," declared Murray as they turned
indoors again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, all Indian," agreed Chantelaine.</p>

<p>The agent of the High Butte Reservation said nothing at
all.</p>

<p>It was Dan home from Calgary the next week-end who eased
Angus's mind (ingenuous though the lad's talk was) of that
constantly recurring thought that he might have done more for his
Indian son, done something of real value, educative, had he only
known of his existence sooner--eased him also of the regret that
so far he seemed unable to be of any real help to All Alone's
boys.</p>

<p>Dan, nearing the end of his second year of high school, was at
an age for seeming to some bumptious, and to others promisingly
inquiring. Those who had not forgotten their own hobbledehoy
awakenings would look leniently upon the tangle of his probings,
no doubt, and let them go as <i>awkward</i> rather than as
<i>bumptious.</i></p>

<p>Angus was reminded, listening to him, how once he had felt
that Fiona had made up on him. His son was making up on him. They
were riding--Dan and he--over the reserve, and he could not but
hear the lad's voice as a man's, and his laugh had but the
slightest rumour in it of the notes that used to ring round the
play-tepee only, as it were, the other day.</p>

<p>The boy was at an age for enthusiasms. Angus had been, to Sam
Douglas, somewhat of a drifter. The son, thought Sam, seeing him
in Calgary, was "a great improvement on the father."</p>

<p>"Angus has the Celtic dreaminess," Sam told his wife,
Patricia. "He'd be happy--well, he'd be happy looking at the
colours in an icicle! Daniel has ambeetion."</p>

<p>It was ambition that Sam, with hearty approbation, chiefly
noted, but, riding over the reserve, some other quality did Dan
divulge to his father. He had been saying he was more keen than
ever to become a doctor.</p>

<p>"And when you have passed," said Angus, "where would you think
to take up practice? Or have you not thought as far ahead as
that?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter much where," replied Dan. "I'd like to go
into the Indian service--doctor on a reserve. I mentioned that to
Mr. Douglas once, and he seemed rather horrified--disappointed.
He said he had hoped I would aim beyond that. In the early days
the Indians didn't have the diseases they have now, and it is up
to us, Dad, to get them back to the old state of health. I know
some of them are still magnificent specimens. I saw one wrapped
in a blanket the other day run several hundred yards to head off
some straying horses, and he didn't have to drop his arms from
holding the blanket round him. He came back without a puff. But
we've put them into houses out of tents, and they don't know how
to keep the houses clean. Nature cleans up an old camp-site and
its neighbourhood. A lot of them have lost heart. They used to be
far cleaner in the old days, according to what one hears, than
they are now."</p>

<p>"We want better, more sanitary houses for them," agreed Angus,
"and that calls for funds. Some of the houses are just hovels. I
know it. A trapper lives alone in his one-room cabin, but a whole
family in one small shack--"</p>

<p>"And that's why I prefer medical missionaries to the other
sort," said Dan, "hygiene before hymns, sanitation before
sermons."</p>

<p>Three Indian youths appeared on a crest, clad only in
breech-clout and moccasins--running.</p>

<p>"They can run farther than a horse could carry them in a day,"
said Dan. "I wonder how long they will be like that--fit for the
<i>moccasin telegraph.</i> I often think of the stories you've
told me of the old Northwest before I was born. It's the stamina
of their grandfathers they are doing it on. A man was telling me
in Calgary the other day that he has seen the Blackfeet snaring
gophers. When the Bloods were restless, and Colonel Macleod
advised Ottawa, he got a reply to <i>use his discretion</i>, and
his discretion was to open a sort of soup-kitchen for them at the
fort. Malnutrition over a certain number of years may tell on
them badly, make them susceptible to T.B. and trachoma."</p>

<p>So he had inherited, it would appear, his father's
<i>kink!</i> They rode in silence some way. They saw an old man
on a crest heliographing with a disc-mirror in his palm to some
young men in a coulee--signalling them home to a meal
perhaps--former Indian usages surviving there. The sight of a
string of Mennonite wagons moving across distance turned them to
the subject of the right to free worship. There had been talk of
trying to put a stop to ceremonial dances on the reserve as
tending to keep them Indians, and Angus had pointed out,
discussing that with the visiting commissioner that Doukhobours
and Mennonites had religious freedom, that two different sects
were represented at the missions, and (with a deep antipathy to
coercion and breaking of the spirit that was no doubt implanted
in the days of hopeless rage against, and broken acceptance of,
the <i>Clearances</i>)--"we don't want to break them utterly," he
had finished, to which the commissioner agreed.</p>

<p>He recounted that talk to Dan.</p>

<p>"We give them," said Dan, "a bell for a drum, poker and
black-jack for their own games of chance, hard leather shoes that
hurt the feet for moccasins that allow full play of the pedal
muscles and a correct standing attitude--" then he raised his
head and laughed, in a sudden diffidence. "You see what I'm
trying to get at, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Angus, promptly.</p>

<p>So the boy recovered and continued:</p>

<p>"They have the sun, they have all this, and they love it."</p>

<p>"Yes, they love it," said Angus, and thought how he had come
to love it also--and yet, growing older, longed again to see
Brendan and the loch with the inverted mountains and the silver
passage of reflected gulls in its veneered darkness and the
sunlight slipping off Ben Chattan. His heart was sick sometimes
with such memories, but memory of the eviction (unforgettable)
and recollection of the Ettricks' minds and ways allayed
homesickness. His Scotland was no place on which he could set
foot and feel beneath his tread, but a country of the mind at
once definite and unsubstantial--as a song, an old ballad, sung
and dying on the air.</p>

<p>"There are slums in all cities," observed Dan, breaking into
his father's reverie of a moment, "lousier than the lousiest
Indian camp. We can invent steam-engines and the Indian can only
call them fire-wagons, and no more than a dog wonder how they go,
just say <i>mystery.</i> And yet--scratch the civilized man and
where is he? Bang down at the level of what he imagines is the
average level of depraved savages."</p>

<p>They were riding up the flank of a long coulee and came to the
windy summit. Just below the opposite rim they saw the house of
All Alone. They could see Peter--who had just come in from the
range, to judge by the horse standing by--down on all fours to
amuse his little brother, the small boy astride his back waving
an arm in the air in a game of bucking bronchos. On the porch was
a figure--not Tannisse by the size. That would be Louise, of whom
Angus had had a fine report recently. They did not think, at the
mission, that when her schooldays were over she would <i>go</i>
<i>back to the blanket.</i></p>

<p>"Up to a certain point," said Dan, as they rode on, "this
civilization business is fine. Then it passes into
sophistication. Right here on this reserve you, Dad, are doing
all that's worth for these people."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>He was doing all that was worth doing for them, was he? Yet,
listening to the uncrystallized talk of his fumbling son he felt
somehow eased.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" exclaimed Dan. "I do have an awful lot to say. And all
muddled, too, I suppose."</p>

<p>"God bless the lad," thought Angus. "He's on the right trail,
but young, young."</p>

<p>He, himself, was beginning to feel, and look, old.</p>

<p>Yet there were times when he did not feel old, rejuvenated
with adventure and celebration. There was that St. Andrew's
dinner and dance, for example.</p>

<p>There was just a drizzle of rain wetting the surface of the
land. The Rockies were no longer peaks. They were a seeth of
darker vapour on the horizon. Here and there, in the running gray
above, a hole was punched, showing blue for a moment. It was a
snell day.</p>

<p>The era of closed cars had not come yet, but open cars were
beginning to oust the horse-hauled buggies, cutters and sledges.
They had one at the agency, and for Fiona's sake Angus decided to
go to the station in it, automobile being speedier than horse,
though he preferred the feel of reins in his hand to a wheel.</p>

<p>When they reached the first slope, where the road swerved to
go over the crest, the car hesitated then slowly, deliberately,
slithered sideways. Fiona gave a little yelp.</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" soothed Angus, clinging to the wheel.
"She won't go over."</p>

<p>She didn't. The car slid broadside to the bottom of the coulee
among the glistening wet scrub there. He backed, turned, and they
went like a small boat in a choppy sea over the uneven ground to
the two ruts that were road, lurched into them again and purred
uphill.</p>

<p>"Giddap! Steady! Giddap!" Angus gaily counselled.</p>

<p>Just at the curve the hummocks between ruts were slightly
broken down. Too soon he whooped, "Made the grade! Away we go!"
Away they slid sideways once more to the bottom of that greasy
knoll, with a gasp from Fiona.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I've left my stomach behind up there!" she
said.</p>

<p>"All right. Chains!" Angus decided.</p>

<p>He got out in a drizzle, pulled on overalls to protect his
suit from the mire, and laid the chains on the ground. By that
time Fiona, who could drive any sort of team and ride almost any
sort of horse, was beginning to feel nervous. When he slacked the
brake and let the car slip back a foot or so, to bring the wheels
over the chains, she gasped again. Chains on, he rolled up his
muddy overalls. As he slipped in behind the wheel she noticed
flakes of snow on him.</p>

<p>"Snowing!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Just beginning."</p>

<p>"And cold!"</p>

<p>"Away we go. All aboard for the dance!" he cried out, slamming
the door.</p>

<p>Up the slope the motor purred, hesitated near the crest, then
with increasing roar swept on and climbed the ridge. Angus
speedily changed gear. That little hitch was over. But, with a
hiss as out of a thousand salt-shakers, the snow was on them out
of the gray.</p>

<p>"A cutter," remarked Angus, "a hooded cutter, with plenty of
straw to put your feet in, is the thing. These gasoline
buggies--huh!"</p>

<p>The wind shrieked round them. In a few minutes the glass
shield was plastered white. He stopped to turn the screws and
open it that he might see where he was going.</p>

<p>"Tuck yourself up," he advised. "Tuck yourself up."</p>

<p>His fingers, on removing his gloves, stuck to the metal
handles and they were stiff. They would not budge. He had to get
out pliers and turn them. Then he blew in his palms, drew on his
gloves.</p>

<p>"All aboard!" he chanted. "All aboard for High Butte and all
stations south to Calgary and the St. Andrew's dance."</p>

<p>Fiona glanced at him through the drive of the white gale.</p>

<p>"Do you think we should turn back?" she asked. "We may not be
able to see any road. If we turned now we could see our own
trail."</p>

<p>"Our trail is covered," he replied. "We have to go by feel in
the ruts. I think I know the lie of the land, anyhow."</p>

<p>But there was no land. There was just blizzard, and through it
they chirred on.</p>

<p>"These cars," he assured her, "can do anything."</p>

<p>She brightened up.</p>

<p>"We should have brought a compass," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Or towed the house behind on a trailer," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"It seems to have been snowing here far more than back a bit,"
said she.</p>

<p>"Just drifts from the last fall."</p>

<p>She wondered if they had left the side road and were but
travelling in a circle. The snow seemed to come from every side.
Suddenly they went ploughing to the mudguards and stood
still.</p>

<p>"What's that ahead?" he asked.</p>

<p>It was a dark bulk and it moved. A man came forward, advancing
to the car.</p>

<p>"Where are we, stranger?" called Angus.</p>

<p>"At the road to High Butte--main road. Where you want to go?"
It was an Indian who spoke.</p>

<p>"High Butte."</p>

<p>"I tow you for three dollars."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Angus, for the man was one of his wards, called
Dick Big Beaver. He had hunted with his father.</p>

<p>"That you, Mr. Munro?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Dick?"</p>

<p>"I come here with my brother when road going to drift. We come
with wagon. We stop till car come and get in drift. We haul car
out. We haul you for nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, get busy. It's cold."</p>

<p>"A bit cold. Yes, little bit."</p>

<p>The Indians had all ready for such emergencies, with ropes,
chains, and a hook. They acted quickly and in ten minutes Angus
and Fiona were being hauled on again, ahead of them the towing
wagon with two dim figures in it wrapped in blankets on which the
snow lay so that they were like blocks of marble on which a
sculptor had but begun his chiselling. He thought of their
father's hunting--and of theirs, their still-hunting for a motor
car in drift. "Aye, aye," he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"We'll never forget this," said Fiona, her teeth knocking
together as they rolled on.</p>

<p>At last they came to a thing that looked like a snow man.
"What's this?"</p>

<p>"Roadside gas-pump. We're there!" Three dollars Angus gave to
Dick Big Beaver and his brother. They deserved it, he thought,
sitting by the hour beside a bad drift in the road. What would
their fathers have said could they have pictured such a way of
turning an honest dollar?</p>

<p>But they almost forgot about the adventure next evening at
Calgary, sitting down to dinner under the bright lights, Sam
Douglas in his kilts at the head of the table and those who had
no kilts wearing tartan ties of their clans or septs. After
dinner they had all the old dances, strathspeys and reels,
Highland fling, schottische, lancers, and Red River jigs, with
the fiddles wildly playing and shouts of <i>Hooch, Hooch!</i>
ringing to the ceiling.</p>

<p>The old Alberta Hotel was packed that night, and up and down
the stairs, in and out the rooms, Fiona heard--with an
extraordinary emotion considering that her birthplace was Red
River--the Gaelic speech. Going to bed she halted and raised a
finger. Through the open transom of the room next to theirs came
Gaelic again.</p>

<p>Indeed, time was passing. While Dan was in his first term at
McGill the year for Angus's superannuation arrived and Angus and
Fiona talked of a visit to Scotland. But the department did not
adhere strictly to the ordained age limit for retirement when the
right man seemed to be in the right place and his capacities were
not impaired by age. "A man is as old as he feels," the new
western commissioner quoted to him on a visit of inspection.</p>

<p>Yes, the years were flying. The addition to population told it
as well as much else. Chantelaine imported a wife. Macpherson had
done likewise, and together he and his wife had produced a son.
The mission schools were far off, across the reserve, but on one
of them was also another woman, the missionary not considering
that here was no place for her. She had not, by the grace of God,
that malady of the parson's wife who had not helped homesick Mrs.
Hodges. That her husband's collar was worn wrong way round did
not make her a social burden.</p>

<p>They had a daily mail-service--a daily mail-service, there,
one of the Indian lads the Rural Mail Courier. Far off were the
years when Sam, at Calgary, was elated at a fortnightly postal
service between east and west.</p>

<p>To most people, no doubt, there seems at times a sort of happy
chance in life. A reconstruction of the expected, or even a
seeming hitch, it may be, takes to itself the quality of a
dispensation of Providence. To the sense of uncertainty of tenure
Fiona and Angus became accustomed. <i>Carry on for another
year,</i> said the visiting commissioner; and when the year
expired came the same direction by letter more formally
expressed. Then suddenly came conclusion: Chantelaine, it was
decided, was the man for the post, to succeed Angus Munro. That
delay made a happy synchronization, for the year of Angus's
retirement was the year of Dan's passing at McGill.</p>

<p>His wards had, of course, known that sooner or later he would
have to go. It was not till he was on the point of leaving that
he discovered part of the cause for his retention (during the
last four years) had been due to a letter--a letter dictated in
collaboration by old Running Antelope, Tall Whirlwind and All
Alone, and put into English by young Louise--which the department
at Ottawa had received.</p>

<p>He drove round the reserve with Fiona before leaving, bidding
good-bye. Running Antelope was stiff with age but of clear mind.
He said he would come to the agency to say farewell on the day
they were to leave, but Angus explained that they were calling to
save him that journey.</p>

<p>"I am like an old horse now that lies under a tree all day,"
Running Antelope admitted.</p>

<p>His old shrivelled woman wept when they left.</p>

<p>Tall Whirlwind and his two wives (for two wives he had like
some Old Testament gentleman, despite the missionaries' dislike
of the wives and concubines idea) laughed at the parting. They
asked where Angus intended to go, and he told them he was sailing
across the big salt lake to east to where he had been born. For
Fiona and he had decided, when retirement did come, to visit the
Auld Country. Tall Whirlwind, who had learnt some English (not at
the mission) spoke it then in courtesy to Fiona, who had but
little Cree.</p>

<p>"You come back," he said. "I know. You come back. Honest to
God on hell's own bible, you come back, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we'll come back and see you."</p>

<p>"This hell of a good country," he added. "All white men come
back some day."</p>

<p>Driving home, and thinking of Tall Whirlwind's vocabulary,
Angus chuckled, but Fiona wept.</p>

<p>"How silly of me," she said. "I feel so dreadfully moved."</p>

<p>They were to be moved more on the day they left when All Alone
came to say good-bye. He was dressed, all Indian, for the
occasion, on his face ochre paint, his braids wrapped in otter
skins. The increasing infirmities of Running Antelope decreed
that though he was titular chief, Tall Whirlwind and All Alone
were the officiating ones.</p>

<p>They came together. As they were going Angus suddenly recalled
the day when Hodges sat in this room with a package profoundly
tied and knotted, for All Alone put a similar--though
smaller--parcel into his hand and made the sign for a free gift,
a <i>prairie gift.</i> They would be miles away by the time he
had it opened and held in his palm a collet ring.</p>

<p>There was a note with it, written in flowing and sloping
school scription, <i>Because you have often looked at it as if
you liked it, from your friend</i> and signed, in a preposterous
scrawl, <i>All Alone.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c29">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Heather</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In a shipping office in Glasgow, a lean, tanned elderly man,
with a slight stoop of years between his shoulders, made
inquiries across a counter (which was a sheet of gleaming glass
over a map of Scotland), regarding sailings for Loch Brendan. On
a divan under the long windows sat a woman, a decade or so his
junior but with certain lines on her neck that would be called
tell-tale were she one, which she was not, to whom ageing was
subject for secrecy. In her eyes was a girlish vivacity.
Wandering round the place, looking at the pictures that decorated
its walls, was their son--Dan.</p>

<p>"<i>Grey Galloway</i>," he read, and, looking at the poster,
he saw, in the gray-green hummocks, some resemblance to the
rolling prairies that lie between the flatness of the Great
Plains and the definite lift of the foothills. "<i>Peebles for
Pleasure</i>," drew his attention, a vivid representation of a
castle on a knoll with a twist of river below. He considered how
this country he visited was dotted with the ruins of history.</p>

<p>From studying a painting of purple Grampians beyond a carse of
yellow corn he turned and observed that the young man who
attended to his father seemed to be in difficulties.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he heard, drawing near, "the steamer does not go to
the loch-head, unless by special request. There is no public
landing there. It called on the last trip by special arrangements
with the gentleman who has a shooting there."</p>

<p>"Has a what?"</p>

<p>"A shooting there."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Just a minute, sir." The clerk departed for assistance,
returning from an inner room with a pleasant elderly man who
dropped his head to examine Angus over pince-nez.</p>

<p>"You want to go all the way by boat?" the newcomer inquired.
"You don't want to go by train to Oban and--"</p>

<p>"No, all the way by boat."</p>

<p>"If Sir Ernest Reynolds expects you--if you are
expected--"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not expected," replied Angus, "not expected."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I believe your best plan would be to get off at
Catacol Head. There is an inn there."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's an inn, is there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a small place. We have no leaflets about it."</p>

<p>"Which side of the point is it?" asked Angus, trying to
picture it.</p>

<p>"This side," said his informant with a finger on the glass
over the map. "Just inside the sound."</p>

<p>"Very good. That will do."</p>

<p>It was a fine August. There was a golden glow on the
dust-motes of Glasgow. In the parks that they visited the scent
of flowers was heady and heavy. The little breezes that came to
town stirred the straw at the door of warehouses, troubled young
clerks and warehousemen with hints of heather hills out by.</p>

<p>Arran, as the Munros went down the firth, was purple, veined
with zigzag burns, Goatfell lit like a beacon by the terrific
sunset. When they came on deck in the morning Ireland was astern,
Jura on the port, Argyll on the starboard bow, and Angus, looking
at the coral-tinted peaks, the slumbering dark-blue glens,
thought to himself that a man had but one life to live and that
it was a pity he had not been able to live his here. He seemed to
know it even from beyond his youth, as though in the corpuscles
of his blood were memories of these colours and the solemn quiet
broken only by the hiss of wave-tops.</p>

<p>"It's hard to have to go below even for meals," said Dan, "but
appetite here is sharp."</p>

<p>When on deck again Angus saw the purser fussing between
folding chairs on which people reclined wrapped in rugs, the
fringes of which a wind plucked, a cold wind despite the sun.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, sir. Are you going to Sir Ernest
Reynolds'?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"We have some people on board for the head of the Sound--for
Sir Ernest's place. You're for Catacol Head, then. Nice little
inn there. It's not what you would call Ritzy but the good lady
makes her own oatcakes and scones. It is the real thing. I'll
send a steward to see about your luggage."</p>

<p>"That'll be fine!"</p>

<p><i>The Clansman</i> turned a little inshore. A fresh volley of
gulls came out to join those that convoyed her. Ben Chattan
looked through a notch. She took the turn into the Sound. There
were twinkling windows and whitewashed walls on the inner side of
Catacol Head. As they surged close inshore Angus could see the
twists of the loch stretching into the land and two yachts, by
their polished hulls and rakish yellow funnels, at anchor.</p>

<p>The deck shook under his feet as the siren roared. He listened
to the echoes as they came tumbling back. She slowed down and lay
there. A great boat, two men pulling at the sweeps, came
alongside, and down went Angus. Fiona and Dan on the overside
gangway. The men in the boat were talking Gaelic to each other;
Angus wished he had not forgotten almost all of his.</p>

<p>There was a little strip of concrete walk, a miniature
esplanade, on the inner side of Catacol Head, and a cluster of
boats joggled together at a jetty, with white-painted cork
fenders overside. As they stepped ashore a young lad
approached.</p>

<p>"Are you for the inn, sir?" he asked shyly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angus.</p>

<p>"I'll carry your bags up."</p>

<p>What was that whiff in the air? What was that odour? It gave
him a sickness at the heart.</p>

<p>"You burn peat here still, my lad," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, indeed."</p>

<p>"So that's the smell of peat!" exclaimed Dan, and then, "Say,
young fellow, you can't carry all that."</p>

<p>The boy looked astounded as Dan grabbed two suitcases from
him.</p>

<p>"Put them down, sir," he implored, "and I'll come back for
them."</p>

<p>"That's all right."</p>

<p>The youth was highly puzzled; and puzzled, too, was the
landlady as she saw them advancing. What kind of folk were these?
She eyed them keenly. Aye, the right kind, she decided, though
one of them was helping with the luggage.</p>

<p>"That's kind of you, sir, rale kind of you," she said,
"helping the lad, whatever. Just put them down here."</p>

<p>As they entered Dan could not but notice one or two people
sitting in the big front room because of the manner in which they
examined them, turning their heads as if, though they were not
wearing high collars, they imagined they were. Well, we have been
duly examined, he considered.</p>

<p>Fiona looked all round, radiant. Had she told any of them that
she was fifty they would have cried out, "Nonsense!" It was a
quaint interior with a big fireplace at one end, and there were
the authentic peat divots smouldering, a big pot hanging over
them depending from a hook--chiefly for ornament, she surmised. A
tall grandfather clock against one wall ticked loudly. A ship
inside a bottle stood in a window embrasure. She was going to
like this place.</p>

<p>Angus was extraordinarily quiet. He felt as a ghost and was to
feel more so when in the morning they set out for a walk along a
gravelled road that skirted the Sound. At a bend he could see to
the very end of the loch beyond the two yachts. No houses there!
And, as they proceeded, there was no fail-dyke round an acre or
two but, instead, a high barbed-wire fence--a very high
fence--coming down the hill, crossing the road, and passing even
into the water. Dan opened a gate in it and closed it again
behind them.</p>

<p>"So this is Loch Brendan," said Fiona with a catch in her
voice, thinking that here her forbears had lived, breathing this
air, hearing that guttural plop of water, seeing that lift and
fall of the seaweed fringe.</p>

<p>"This is Loch Brendan," replied Angus, a thickness in his
voice. It seemed to come from far away.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the sound of the pipes. There had been
pipes at Fort Garry, but these took him back to a more distant
piping. It was, however, no coronach that was played that day.
They were piping him home with <i>The Cock of the North</i>--and
here, at any rate, was a birch wood on the shoulder of the hill,
all its leaves dancing together.</p>

<p>"In a cot hereabouts the girl of my calf-love lived," said he.
Jessie he could jest about. Of Minota he could never speak.</p>

<p>Fiona laughed.</p>

<p>"You must tell me about her," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, indeed, that's far away," he answered. "I might
not recognize her now."</p>

<p>As they walked on, coming beyond the wood, they saw a house
upward a little way, a large house with wide windows and many
gables. On a lawn before it the little figure of a piper strutted
and wheeled.</p>

<p>"So that's the shooting-box they told me about," observed
Angus. "Aye, aye."</p>

<p>He turned aside from the road. He went wandering here and
there, looking left and right in the bracken. Something in his
manner made his wife and son stop. They sat down on the heather
as he tapped to and fro among the sun-scorched ferns. They saw
him turn facing the loch, raise his hands before him, and spread
them apart a little way.</p>

<p>"Yes, this was the door," he called to them, his hands
elevated so.</p>

<p>They rose and came closer.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands--like that," said Angus. "There's the view
from the door, son. That bides. Aye, that bides."</p>

<p>He looked round at the sound of a foot on a stone. A man about
his own height, but of heavier build, in breeches, leggings,
Norfolk jacket, was standing there. He seemed uncertain how to
begin, examined them, and decided that before he spoke he should
touch his cap.</p>

<p>"Are ye aware," said he, "that ye are trespassing?"</p>

<p>Angus returned the half-salute.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not aware," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, ye are. I'll have tae order ye off."</p>

<p>Angus was suddenly proud of an emotion that possessed him. His
Scotland was perhaps chiefly a kingdom of the mind, but he had
learnt something in that other country, his country of exile and
adoption (in which more Gaelic was spoken than in Scotland), and
he was glad.</p>

<p>"Very good," he said. "You have told me. You have ordered me
off--" and he gave the man his back.</p>

<p>"I have tae order ye off," the keeper repeated.</p>

<p>"Well, well, you have done your duty--you have ordered me
off," replied Angus. "And having ordered me, I order you go and
tell your master that you have done so."</p>

<p>The gamekeeper looked at Fiona, looked at Dan. That young man
was smiling gently, proud of his father.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Angus, turning, "it may interest you to know
I was born here," and he swept with his stick among the heather,
tapping it upon a row of half-embedded lichened stones. "Inteet,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angus, "and evicted. And I'm not going to be
evicted now."</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly. Puzzled, the man turned away, giving
another half-salute to all three, glancing again at Fiona and Dan
as though for some gesture of ratification from them, as though
wondering if they were in some sense keepers of a lunatic.</p>

<p>Angus paid no more heed to him. He dismissed him from his
mind, walked on by the loch-side and left the road where it took
a bend uphill. They saw him feeling there again among the bracken
and heather with his stick.</p>

<p>"What has he found now, I wonder?" asked Dan.</p>

<p>Angus had told his wife much of his early days and so--</p>

<p>"I expect," said she, "it is the old graveyard. Everything
seems to be gone. You heard what he said. The little church he
described to me once is not here. I fancy it must be the
gravestones he has found."</p>

<p>Slowly he came back toward them, did not call them over there.
It was then, down the path up which the gamekeeper had gone, they
saw a lean little man in a kilt approaching. When he halted
beside Angus they looked away that they might not seem to be
staring, and when they pried back again there were these two
seated on the hillside in converse, too far off to be
overheard.</p>

<p>"Good day," the kilted one began.</p>

<p>"Good day, sir."</p>

<p>"One of my men tells me that you say you were born here."</p>

<p>"Well, he's being truthful," replied Angus.</p>

<p>"Sit down. By the way, I'm Ernest Reynolds."</p>

<p>"I'm pleased to meet you. My name is Angus Munro."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Munro, and tell me. I'm interested to know the
old history of this place."</p>

<p>"The old history," echoed Angus, dryly.</p>

<p>Fiona, glancing round again, saw that they had risen.</p>

<p>"Here's the best way to tell you," Angus said, and led Sir
Ernest Reynolds into the bracken. He dabbed with his stick.
"That's the place," he explained. "That's where I was born."</p>

<p>"So! Yes, I can see there are stones there."</p>

<p>"Aye, and there are other stones yonder, where I was when you
came down the hill. I see the rains of the years have left but
few of the letters on them."</p>

<p>"Gravestones?"</p>

<p>"Gravestones."</p>

<p>"So! Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down," said Angus this time, as though he were
the host. "Sit down here and put your feet on the bed where my
mother bore me, so to speak. We'll sit on all that's left of the
wall. There was a text from Scripture used to hang just about
here, where your head is--<i>God is Love</i>, in the Gaelic. They
were distributed by some society for promulgating Christian
knowledge among the savage Highlanders. Well, sir, there were
worse evictions than ours. There were evictions for generations,
when they burned the thatch over the people's heads and flung
chairs, stools, and spinning-wheels out of the doors. That is the
history you wanted to know. The whole length of the Highlands
there have been even pregnant women turned out. My mother was the
one that knew that old history. Yes, and when they made
themselves a shelter in some ditch on the hillside with cabers
across it for a roof they were driven out of that."</p>

<p>"But why were they evicted?" Sir Ernest interrupted.</p>

<p>"To make room for the sheep, and sometimes not even that, only
nominally so, really to make room for the deer."</p>

<p>"So!"</p>

<p>"Yes. The landlords, their old chiefs, would never show up,
left it to a factor and his menials and the law officers."</p>

<p>"Oh, the evictors had the law on their side! How was
that?"</p>

<p>"Because they first served notices of ejectment, the way your
man came down here and warned us off just now."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest, who had been studying Angus's face, looked away
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Did they never fight?" he asked of the air before him, gazing
up at Ben Chattan. "Did they never offer resistance?"</p>

<p>"Now and again--and they went to the penitentiary for it. But
often enough the evictions were made when most of the men were
either at the herring fishing or in the lowlands for the
hairst."</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The harvest. The harvest work."</p>

<p>"But," said Sir Ernest, "ground like this must always have
been rather poor for cultivation."</p>

<p>"It was," agreed Angus. "They were driven onto it from better
land in the glens--my own father was--and then finally driven
away from even the poor soil. People would say, 'I can't think
why they want to cling to that poor soil.' Another turn of the
screw, always another turn of the screw. When they were forced
onto an arid place like this they took to the manufacture of
kelp, from seaweed, as another means of livelihood. When it was
seen they were making money on that their rents were raised."</p>

<p>"So, so, so!" exclaimed Sir Ernest in a new tone, and turning
to Angus, again he inquired: "Could not the clergy do
anything--preach against it?"</p>

<p>Angus shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The clergy!" he snorted. "The lairds had the church patronage
at their disposal," and he looked into Sir Ernest's eyes to see
if he understood.</p>

<p>"Enough said--"</p>

<p>"Exactly! That's another reason why they did not put up a
fight. The clergy told them it was foreordained by the Almighty,
or as a punishment for sins, and there would be a wrath of heaven
and eternal damnation in hell-fire on all those who resisted. We
had our passage money and our rations on the boat, a month's
sustenance allowance for when we landed in Canada, and signed a
paper that we went of our own free will--to save their
faces."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, most of them did go of their own free will in the
end, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"The kind of free will that desperation ordains," said Angus.
"I thought of it all once when I heard of a band of Sioux Indians
in America finally driven to sign a treaty giving away their
land. They put their crosses to it and then the chief said, 'We
have signed. <i>When do we eat?</i>'"</p>

<p>"It was like that, eh? You went hungry sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Often," replied Angus, "even in my time. Shell-fish and
potatoes was a good meal. Did you ever try stewed nettles with a
pinch of oatmeal thrown in?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I ever did," said Sir Ernest Reynolds. At that
they both raised their heads and laughed.</p>

<p>"They seem to be getting on pretty well," Dan remarked to his
mother where they had seated themselves.</p>

<p>"You mentioned Indians," said Sir Ernest. "You come
from--"</p>

<p>"From Canada."</p>

<p>A sound of shooting broke out. The little man glanced over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Those are my guests," said he, "shooting my grouse. To hell
with them," he added, gently.</p>

<p>Angus looked at him with surprise and curiosity. Sir
Ernest--sitting there, because of the lowness of all that was
left of the wall, hunched with his knees to his chin--edged
himself a little closer, confidentially closer.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said he, "that you are heaven-sent. I have
nobody to talk to."</p>

<p>"With all your guests shooting your grouse--"</p>

<p>"So! So!" repeated Reynolds, nodding his head. "I think I envy
you. I wish my father had stayed in America."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't born over there, but my people went out, tried it
for awhile, came back. He was a timber merchant. We got pretty
poor after our return to England. It's odd what a fellow can date
his beginnings from. My beginning was one day in the dinner
hour--a fifteen shillings a week junior clerk--sitting at the
back of St. Paul's Cathedral eating my lunch out of a bag. I
threw some crumbs to the pigeons, onto the grass, and a policeman
came along. 'Can't you read?' he said, and pointed to one of the
notices. It announced distinctly that pigeons must not be fed
<i>on the paths.</i> I said that I was feeding them on the grass.
He told me he didn't want what he called my sauce and walked off
a little way and stood with his head slewed round glaring at
me--you know that horrible look. That was the beginning of my
fortune!" He tapped Angus on the knee. "I said to myself, 'My
boy, you are going to get into a position in which--and always
going to dress in such a way--the police will respect you.' I
think lots of men have had something back in their lives that has
had a tremendous influence on them, whether they know it or not.
You understand me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Munro, I'm just beginning to think, when it is almost too
late, that it's a pity I allowed that policeman to make me a
climber!" and he laughed wryly.</p>

<p>So vigorous was his utterance, though his voice was low, that
Angus sitting there beside him turned to scrutinize his face--a
lined old face, a lean old face, parchmenty, with a grim mouth on
which was marked an odd blend of arrogance and bitter humour.</p>

<p>"See me now," said Sir Ernest Reynolds. "I have a home in
London with grounds, gardens, and the address is not Surrey or
Kent, but <i>London.</i> So you know. Gardeners of lords come to
look at it; lords themselves come to look at it. There's a little
garden as big as--as small as, I should say"--his wrinkled,
skinny hand moved in air before him--"this cottage you were born
in, oh, half the size if that's the end over there. It's a freak
thing, a Japanese freak thing. I had two gardeners--from
Japan--to design it. You sit back from it and focus your eyes
till you get the illusion of an immense garden, acres, with the
paths through and a statue here and a statue there. Well, all
right. Then there is a big garden, a replica of that miniature
one, but on a large scale. You should see my house parties there.
<i>Useful people</i> to me, and they know it, so they use me. I
live in a little sitting-room at the top with a bedroom off it.
Just across the landing my secretary has a room. My guests ring
the bell and order tea when they want it; they ask to have the
menu from the butler to see what the dinner is to be, and if
there is any special dish they want that's not on it they ask for
it."</p>

<p>"No!" ejaculated Angus.</p>

<p>"So!" shouted Reynolds, and brought his hand down with a slam
on his new friend's knee.</p>

<p>That loud "So!" caused Fiona and Dan--he then lying flat upon
his chest on the heather--to look toward these two again. They
wondered if there was some trouble there but, by their attitudes,
all seemed well.</p>

<p>"And for why?" asked Sir Ernest, and himself answered:
"Because they know we are climbers."</p>

<p>"It doesn't make any excuse for them," said Angus
indignantly.</p>

<p>"So. No. Well, my two boys have gone to Oxford, but even
Oxford can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Go up to
Oxford a snob and you may come down an accentuated snob and
bounder. One of them is a snob; the other--he's all right. And
that will protect them from something I've had to suffer. I've
known the ignominy of poverty--though I've never eaten nettles
and oatmeal. But I've suffered another ignominy. Do you know
there are people who will fire off Latin quotations when they are
talking to me, with a sly kind of look in their eyes. I've learnt
how to cope with them. I say, 'No spika ze language!' That
finishes them! Anyhow, I don't pretend. I don't bounce about
being self-made any more than I pretend to be 'varsity-bred."</p>

<p>He suddenly began to laugh loud as if he saw, in a flash of
discovery or revelation, the fun of life.</p>

<p>"Pills!" he broke out.</p>

<p>Angus stared at him, wondering what he meant.</p>

<p>"The foundation of my fortune was in pills," he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Angus.</p>

<p>There was more shooting behind them.</p>

<p>"They are sitting up there in the butts on their
shooting-sticks and their camp-stools, and the descendants of
those who were not evicted from this land are strung out by the
mile waving little flags, with dogs trained to go along and poke
in the bushes, raising the grouse, and getting into trouble if
they let one fly back the wrong way. There they go again. Can you
understand, Mr. Munro, that I'm getting a little tired of it?
Lady Reynolds doesn't quite see it as I do. Well, well, I'm
afraid I'm keeping you. I shouldn't say that of her, anyhow. If
that's your wife and son with you I wish you'd introduce me."</p>

<p>They both came stiffly to their feet and walked over to Fiona
and Dan, Dan leaping up as they drew near.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Sir Ernest Reynolds. There was a
suffusion of friendliness and kindliness on his face. "I'm afraid
I've been very discourteous, but your husband and I have been
having a great talk. You see," his mouth twisted to one side, "I
don't meet many people. I hope you will make yourselves at home.
I hope you'll go just where you will. I'll tell my men not to
bother you--anywhere, anywhere," and he waved his skinny hand. "I
would like you to come up to the house but I'm afraid it would
bore you. It bores me. You know, it's very nice down at the inn.
She's a nice woman."</p>

<p>"It's a quaint place," said Fiona.</p>

<p>"Yes, a quaint place," he agreed. "I like that ship in the
bottle in the window. Her husband made it. You'll be staying for
a little while, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Angus's gaze roved the mountains opposite. Beside one of the
yachts lying at the Sound's end there was a sudden splash that
drew their eyes. The deep darkness of the water was ringed with
silver and there came winging from here, winging from there--to
pounce screaming on what had been ejected from the
galley-chute--watchful gulls. They swooped down over the quiet
crisscrossing of their reflections.</p>

<p>"I think, probably," said Angus, "we will be going
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"So? Well, sir, it has been a great pleasure to meet you. But
lest you should decide to stay--it's all yours, anywhere,
please." He backed away from them, bowing. "I'll tell my
men."</p>

<p>They turned and walked slowly back to the inn.</p>

<p>"He's a fine old fellow," said Dan, when they were well out of
earshot. "But he doesn't seem happy to me. You'd think he would
be happy here. Listen to those gulls, Dad. Listen! Don't you like
to hear them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c30">CHAPTER THIRTY</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Buffalo Bill</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Back from Loch Brendan to Glasgow, they went to London. They
motored out to Hampstead Heath, saw a clump of firs there,
strolled on Parliament Hill under high kites, smoke in the valley
below them and the bubble of St. Paul's protruding. They took
train to Loughton to see Epping Forest and were sunk deep in
melancholy on the way--as they looked from the carriage windows
on unlovely streets and alleys, a desert of dismality--to think
that people lived there, the uncurtained dreariness accentuated,
or taunted, by what sunshine percolated through the twilight of
that forenoon.</p>

<p>They came back uncheered by the sinister pollarded hornbeams
of the forest, and next day went to Kew Gardens, where Angus
recalled winter evenings at Rocky Mountain House and talks there
of the days before his days because of David Douglas, sometime of
Perth and of this place, who went wandering with a buffalo robe
and a vasculum among the western ranges from Fort Spokane to the
Babine country. They walked on Westminster Bridge, watching the
blunt barges scoon below on a flowing tide, looked at St.
Thomas's Hospital, and, leaning there, Angus asked Dan how he
would care to take up practice of medicine in England.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Dan, noncommittal.</p>

<p>They went to Edinburgh and admired the Grecian effect of the
columns on Calton Hill, drove to Hawthornden, drove to Roslin,
drove to the Forth Bridge and stared up at its high iron
lace-work. For a sentiment, or a light curiosity, going to see
what used to be the Ettrick shop, Angus was amazed to find it a
bookshop still--with the name <i>Ettrick</i> over the door and
windows. He entered to make a purchase. There of a certainty was
the younger brother of former days, crabbed and old, and there,
by facial evidence, was his son. From an anxious look in the
assistants' eyes he surmised the business was carried on as
usual. William, he of the Wee Black Book, was dead, no doubt.</p>

<p>The <i>shadows</i> were extraordinarily real to him that day
as he stepped out onto the hot pavement again. The shadow of Hill
Burton, handkerchief--pocket-napkin--protruding from the
tail-pocket of his surcoat, passed by. He thought of Lasswade,
wondered again where Jessie Grant was. Odd to be here and not to
wish to see her, try to discover her. The Camerons would be dead
by now, surely dead: she would not likely be there.</p>

<p>They made Edinburgh their headquarters awhile, taking trips to
Melrose and to Peebles (for pleasure) on the one hand, to
Stirling and to St. Andrews on the other, ever and again Fiona
and Angus wondering <i>how it would be to live here,</i> each
trying to find out just what the other felt on the matter. But
always, when that subject was broached, Dan would give his
noncommittal "Oh, I don't know--"</p>

<p>Then one day, walking on Princes Street, clearly taken for
American tourists, drivers of cabs and brakes chanting to them,
"Roslin, Roslin, Forth Bridge," Angus wondered if his mind had
become deranged by thinking too much of the past on this visit.
For, moving grandly along the street with slow steps, moccasined,
and topped by enormous war-bonnets, came three North American
Indians.</p>

<p>Something had gone wrong! He was on his way to the Ettrick
bookshop again. He knew what would happen. He would halt them
with the sign-talk and they would lead him to a hall hung with
pictures and there introduce him to a clean-shaven man with keen
and kindly eyes.</p>

<p>He looked at Fiona. He looked at Dan, who eased him by asking,
"Do you see what I see?" The people on the pavement gave way to
these three figures.</p>

<p>Angus halted, held up his hand, made the signs <i>Where
from?</i> Expressionless, the three observed the gestures. They
were on guard. So many marvels they were viewing that they had
schooled themselves not to make ejaculation, show astonishment,
over anything.</p>

<p>"I come," he told them with his signs, "from the land of the
Blackfoot and the Cree."</p>

<p>One or two passing by turned their heads, puzzled as to what
he was about. There was an old man, possibly drunk, making funny
passes to three Indians of Buffalo Bill's Show! That is what they
would think. But in Princes Street folk are more decorous than in
some other thoroughfares. The tallest of the three raised both
hands to his head, drew them down, ran a finger across his
throat, and one of the passersby, who had paused, mouth open,
moved on speedily, thinking it was a sign that murder was going
to be done.</p>

<p>Sioux! But where from? For there were Sioux in Canada. <i>From
the bad lands west of the muddy river.</i> They were Dakota
Sioux--of the generation between the unconquerable and the
starved, plundered, profaned, disinherited, broken, dejectedly
yet bravely dying.</p>

<p>"Buffalo Bill Show," said one, speaking English in the usual
slow, deliberate enunciation. "You must come to our camp in the
showground."</p>

<p>"I surely will. I surely will."</p>

<p>And they did, that very afternoon, and found their three there
again. They talked with Kicking Bear of the glittering and steady
gaze, the mouth shaped, it seemed, by misdoubt from many promises
unfulfilled, a mouth of disappointment; with John Shangrau in
charge of the military hostages who were with the show to see how
many more people could come if they cared; and with Colonel
Cody.</p>

<p>In the evening Fiona, Angus and Dan sat and watched a pageant
of the west, saw a curtain rise at the proscenium beyond the
arena, revealing an ancient forest of the Atlantic seaboard,
Indians walking there (no white people come) under the trailing
of lianae and moss tassels to the music, rendered softly, that
Angus had first heard in '77 played by the Mounted Police band as
he rode up the north bank of the Bow from Blackfoot Crossing.
Strauss had been in New York in '76 with his orchestra and a year
later his waltzes were played, hummed, and whistled at what was
then the Back of Beyond, still, on the maps, <i>the Great
American Desert!</i> The curtain fell and they saw Indians
walking on the plains, the arena, before they had horses, meeting
others there, conversing at long range by signs, gathering
together, smoking a pipe in fraternal circle, dancing to the thud
of their drums, passing away in groups to the strains of a Sousa
march. The curtain rose to reveal some buttes and bad-lands,
tufts of sage-brush, Missouri way, and a frontier fort in
foreground, a sentry pacing on the walls. A rider of the Pony
Express galloped by, made two leaps with the mail-bag from his
horse to the one held awaiting him, and was gone. Then the
Deadwood stage-coach swept in, pursued by the Indians they had
met on Princes Street--and others. The shooting and the cries
nearly drowned out the strains of <i>Washington Post.</i> There
were horse races between cowboys and Indians that took Fiona and
Angus back to Red River and Dan to the reserve and fair days at
High Butte. There were exhibits of rifle marksmanship and
revolver shooting that recalled to Angus's mind the shotgun
experts at Fort Edmonton in the days before the Redcoats arrived.
A herd of buffaloes lumbered across the scene, Cody behind,
riding easy as in a rocking-chair--a dozen or so of the survivors
from the herds he had helped to bring to the state of relics.</p>

<p>Not from a land of stage-coaches being attacked by Indians,
not from pastures of the buffalo, but from pastures of steers for
market and wheat-fields had the Munros come; and yet, sitting
there viewing an exhibition that many, possibly, considered but
as a glorified three-ring circus for schoolboys, they were so
moved that the dust raised was not Edinburgh dust but dust of
Alberta--and as for the tufts of sage-brush in the back-drop of
the fort scene, it seemed to Fiona she could whiff them as though
she had run a hand up the stems, husking the flowers and crushing
them in her palm.</p>

<p>The band played God <i>Save the King</i> and they went out
from illusion to--well, to Angus it was illusion of another sort:
From George Catlin to Colonel Cody, in the flying years, all was
as a dream to him.</p>

<p>In the morning they sallied forth as usual to decide, after
they got into the streets, what was to be the special outing of
the day. To go to Lasswade and see if he could trace Jessie again
was still in the back of Angus's mind. Wondering whether he
should or no, he found they were passing the window display of a
shipping agent's office. All halted as at the dictate of some
shared nostalgia.</p>

<p>"Well," said Angus, "I suppose we can't stay here forever. How
about going in and seeing what boat we might make reservations
on?"</p>

<p>"I think we might as well," agreed Fiona, slipping a hand over
his arm.</p>

<p>"How about you, Dan?"</p>

<p>"It suits me," replied Dan.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The years that followed were Dan's years, the years of a new
generation, Angus and Fiona in the slack-water.</p>

<p>They swithered some time between settling down at High Butte,
Calgary--or Edmonton, capital of the Province, where the logs of
the old Fort's gateway were but as a memorial and the ducks,
still flying north and south in their seasons, looked down on a
provincial university and government buildings. Angus had his
private vote for High Butte but did not wish to influence Fiona,
left the decision to her. The railway decided her. It was easy
enough to get to Calgary and to High River, where her brother and
his wife still lived. So there they had a house built on the very
edge of "town," which meant, at that time, that they were far
from its last building. They were on the south slope of the butte
in a home not so palatial as Sam's at Calgary, but one that
delighted them, its meshed sleeping-porch (meshed against
mosquitoes) looking west, and a large window in the main
living-room giving an outlook east, south and west.</p>

<p>They thought to have a girl from the reserve to help in the
housework, as they had had at the agency, but the proximity to
High Butte was a deterrent to that suggestion of Angus's. Indian
maids in such service, Fiona reminded him, were looked upon as
lawful prey by the hot young blades of town--the reserve was
practically free of venereal disease and it would be good to keep
it so. Therefore a Chinaman, Mah Yip, reigned in her stead.</p>

<p>Fiona it was who suggested, when they heard of the remarkable
progress of Chief All Alone's younger son at school that, as they
had money to spare, it would be <i>nice</i> to pay the lad's fees
at High School.</p>

<p>"You are almost a sort of god-father to him," she pointed out.
"He's named after you, and according to Nigel Chantelaine it's a
shame that he should not be given a chance to get on. There have
been lots of Indians in professions and--"</p>

<p>"I'd like to do it for him," said Angus, his face
expressionless--and so it was done.</p>

<p>Young All Alone who, reserve school days over, had been acting
as a sort of agency chauffeur, went to High School in Calgary on
the opening of the next term.</p>

<p>On going to the Old Country the Munros had stored their
belongings in an empty room of Murray's house on the reserve.
During the unpacking and arranging, Angus came on a bit of the
past, unaware that it had been preserved: a pamphlet,
<i>Information for Emigrants to British North America,</i>
PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY. <i>Price Sixpence.</i> Yes, he was in
slack-water before the fall, thought he.</p>

<p>Sam Douglas was then his best friend and longest in the west
among those with whom he had kept in touch, and ever and again
they exchanged visits. They liked Sam's wife. The gossip was that
there was quite a romance there. She was a widow, rumour said,
and Douglas had been in love with her as a young man but she
would not have him--which had set him wandering. To be sure Angus
did recall that when he was in Scotland with Sam in the sixties
there had been various private absences, and considered that
these might not always have been for visits to his guardian.
People came to the Munro house in High Butte to talk about other
matters and then to pump him about Douglas. "I really don't
know," he would say; and they would go away remarking that they
believed he knew all about it! Some declared that Sam married her
for her money. Others argued he had no need to do that, being
rich himself, much as they said of the politicians of their own
colour when peculation was hinted of them, "He has no need to--he
has enough!" Sam was a man to gossip about.</p>

<p>Fiona and Angus believed that these two, the old bachelor and
the elderly widow, had married for affection and companionship:
that was the inference on their visits. Mrs. Sam was better
preserved than Fiona, whose face began to have the little lines
of prairie winds and hard water on it. Patricia, a year or two
younger than her husband, had still the colour of climates less
trying on the skin. Fiona had an elderly beauty to the eye of
many; Mrs. Sam was still what's called <i>pretty,</i> though when
Fiona once admired her complexion she replied, "I got it in a
drugstore on Eighth Avenue in a little box."</p>

<p>Sam liked to show people round his house. "If I had built it
bigger--and more as I fancied," he told Angus, "it would have had
a hint of an old castle, but I didn't want to have them dubbing
it <i>Douglas's Folly.</i> You remember seeing the house built by
James Rowan, the old factor of the twenties at Fort Edmonton--yon
edifice that they called <i>Rowan's Folly</i>?"</p>

<p>There they were off in talk of the old days, their days, that
had followed the days that they had arrived but to see the end
of, when the factors from Fort William to the mountains--yes, and
to the coast, through the ranges--would don the full dress of
their clans for anniversaries and celebration and, if possible,
have a piper playing.</p>

<p>That was a charming house of the Douglases to Fiona and Angus.
It had a great hallway in which hung pictures by Charles Russell,
who was called "the Cowboy Artist," and carved woodwork of bears,
prowling and rampant, of mountain-goat on a shelf of cliff, and
such-like, by a half-breed Blackfoot Indian south of the
line--carvings very different from those <i>made in
Switzerland</i> that began to appear for tourists in the curio
shops of Eighth Avenue.</p>

<p>"And here's something to interest you," said Sam, holding up a
photograph. "I got that from Sir John Macdonald. It's of himself
and old Chief Crowfoot sitting on the steps of the Parliament
Building at Ottawa. It's extraordinary how the two are alike in
type and character. I believe Sir John realized that when he
arranged the picture."</p>

<p>"I have a portrait of Crowfoot," said Angus, "showing the
life-pass that the railway company gave him and his two wives,
hanging by a chain round his neck. It was taken by Harry Pollard
years ago. Harry gave me a copy."</p>

<p>"I've seen it. I've always wondered what the thing was that
Crowfoot had hanging there in a little frame. Well Sir John gave
me that one. I suppose you'd think that second-best to getting it
from Crowfoot!" Sam chuckled and prodded Angus in the side with
his elbow, moving on.</p>

<p>There were pictures that came from another quarter of the
world. There was a Raeburn that had been in Sam's family, and
there was old furniture from Mrs. Sam's home. Douglas, in these
days, lost for them that manner that had suggested disappointment
in life. Tapped, he rang true.</p>

<p>That night there was an odd little talk over the dinner-table.
Sam had been saying that Patricia and he would soon be going to
the Old Country, and that he was worried about leaving that house
for long. He was interested in oil then and had floated a
company, the head office of which was in Shaftesbury Avenue,
London. They might be gone some time--even years.</p>

<p>"Aye," said he, "the future of this country--indeed of the
world--is in what they call petrol over there, gasoline here, or
<i>gas,</i> though I don't like the abbreviation. It's confusing
when you consider the natural gas of the land."</p>

<p>"I'm always afraid," observed Mrs. Sam, "when I think of all
the natural gas under Medicine Hat, that some day that natural
gasometer will blow up!"</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>"Aye, times are changed," Sam went on. "I remember when folks
used to say <i>This is no place for a woman.</i> I was down at
the station the other day, the depot, and saw some young fellows
getting their tickets, and heard one say 'This burg is worse than
a married man's town. It's a damned metropolis. I'm off to the
Athabasca.' <i>No place for a woman,</i> and then <i>a married
man's town. Sic transit gloria mundi,</i> eh? Gasoline and
rubber: that's the future. We can't grow rubber here, but we have
shares in rubber plantations in South America. That's all we can
do with rubber. Oil we have under our feet, just as they have
natural gas under their feet Medicine Hat way. Where was I?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had strayed," remarked his wife. "You were at
<i>a married man's town</i>--"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. That's long ago."</p>

<p>"Well, some of the factors and early men married Indian
women," said Patricia. "When I see some of them I wonder how they
could. Poof!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but there are bonny ones and as clean as clean. Eh. Eh,
Angus?" Douglas had no sooner come out with that than he was
urgently saying, "Ye are not finished, Mrs. Munro? Have some
fruit! Have an orange! Have some grapes!"</p>

<p>His wife followed the cue of grapes with a private thought,
and when they were alone that evening, her guests gone to bed,
she revived the subject.</p>

<p>"I know what I want to ask you," she said. "Did Angus Munro
have an Indian woman in the early days?"</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard of," answered Sam, who thought he had
nearly put his foot in it, <i>spilt the beans</i>, and was going
to be sure of not doing so again.</p>

<p>Patricia knew him very well, and to herself thought she, "He
did!" She knew when her husband was lying and accepted him as he
was.</p>

<p>Up in their room Fiona turned to Angus.</p>

<p>"I know something I want to ask you," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>He guessed what was coming and, if it came, he thought he
would tell her all. She would understand then why he was
specially interested in All Alone, in Peter, in Louise (who was
then in the reserve hospital, training as a nurse), and in young
Angus, who continued to come out top of the class in high school.
But he had guessed wrong.</p>

<p>"Did Sam Douglas have an Indian woman in the early days?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No," said he. "No. Not that I ever heard of. No!"</p>

<p>"Not that I would blame a man who did," she declared, after a
few moments' pause. "There were no others practically. And--well,
you know what a lot of men in the Service say: 'The more I see of
white men the more I like Indians!'"</p>

<p>In that pause he had thought it was perhaps better that his
secret remained his secret after all these years, was not shared.
He could not vacillate between to speak and not to speak. So it
slipped into Limbo again.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this visit that the Douglases left
Calgary, and the next they heard of Sam--apart from letters that
he or Patricia wrote--the next public news they had of him was
that he had been knighted. Knighted!</p>

<p>With the departure of the Douglases, and the death of old
Running Antelope, which occurred about the same time, it seemed
the West changed. A new breed came there. A little while ago at
Calgary they saw a blackboard in the station entrance with the
words <i>Eastbound, Arrive, Depart; Westbound, Arrive,
Depart.</i> To that there had been added notices of the arrival
and departure of trains to north and south--south-east,
south-west, north-east, north-west. The land was webbed with
railway lines.</p>

<p>Angus came into a period of crankiness, not with Fiona but
with others. He could not suffer fools gladly. Here was a
generation that knew not Joseph, and members of it exasperated
him. One day in town, detained there, he lunched in the High
Butte Hotel, and overheard at another table two men talking, one
a local real-estate agent, the other evidently a visitor.</p>

<p>"Have you any Indians round you where you are?" asked the
realtor.</p>

<p>"No," replied the visitor. "We have hardly any foreigners at
all."</p>

<p>Angus wanted to rise and hit the man over the head with a
carafe that stood on the table. Little things like that
infuriated him.</p>

<p>"The damned fool!" he rumbled. <i>"Foreigners!"</i></p>

<p>The stranger glanced in his direction, uncertain if he had
heard aright, then looked round the room and saw the covert
smiles of other diners. When Angus rose and departed he looked
after him.</p>

<p>"Did that old fellow say something?" he inquired.</p>

<p>The real-estate man laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes. He said 'The damned fool! <i>Foreigners!'</i> You
needn't bother about him. He's not a bad old guy.
Straight-shooter. Gets kind of cranky sometimes. Retired too
soon. It's a mistake. A man is as old as he feels. They kept him
beyond his time, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What was he, then?"</p>

<p>"Indian agent, and keen on his wards."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!"</p>

<p>A character--that's what Angus would be if he was not
careful.</p>

<p>Dan's progress was then Fiona's main interest in life. He did
hospital work in Winnipeg, remained there some time and later,
the West calling him, moved to Calgary. He bought a small car and
they saw him often, very full of vigour, tireless it would
appear. He found life amusing as well as splashed with troubles.
He was in partnership with another young man and jocundly
explained the position.</p>

<p>"It's politics," he said.</p>

<p>"Politics?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There must always be two on the job. You never know when
an emergency call may come, and it's good to have two. You never
know, either, when you will have a case in which you want another
opinion and don't fancy calling in a stranger."</p>

<p>"But that's not politics?" said Fiona in an inquiring
voice.</p>

<p>"No, I'm coming to that, Mother. One of us is Conservative,
the other Liberal. When the Conservative Party is in power the
Conservative partner gets the Government jobs. When it goes out,
and he goes out, the Liberal partner steps in till the Liberals
are flung out. You keep it in the family, you see," and he
laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>"The country has gone to hell!" exclaimed Angus.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Dad, oh, no. We temporize. We humour 'em."</p>

<p>The idea of departmental service--service with the Department
of the Interior, Indian Affairs--Dan had not discarded, but he
wanted to have more general practice, experience. He had not been
long in Calgary, however, when the Archduke Francis Ferdinand was
slain at Sarejevo and the beans were spilt in Europe. That's what
everyone said as they read the papers, or, "It looks as if there
was going to be scrapping in Europe."</p>

<p>People parroted what they read. With great force one would
explain that international finance made a war impossible there,
and another pronounce that if conflict did come about it would be
short in those days--"Look at the arms countries have now!"
Knowing ones declared there was more in it than met the eye,
political secrets, secret treaties. They did not like the look of
things. Then came the invasion of Belgium, that little nation.
The whole thing had been planned, apparently; Germany had been
building her railways up to the frontier and then, all ready,
awaited the moment to pick a quarrel. Anything would serve. But,
whatever lay behind, here was a little country pounced on by a
big one contrary to promises. And then came the recruiting news
that Britain had agreed to assist Belgium in precisely such a
pass.</p>

<p>There were still horsemen in the West, many of them despite
the motor car, but soon came information that this was a
pedestrian's war. The war correspondent of a certain London
newspaper--that had, for some reason, a large overseas
circulation--happened to mention, in his account of watching the
first British troops land in France, what was the song they had
marched away to the slaughter singing, so all over the land
recruits marched and marched in the mud or dust, singing that it
was a long, long way to Tipperary--and farewell Leicester Square.
Even at High Butte they marched, singing that. They could be seen
and heard from the big window of the Munro house as they trudged
and sang.</p>

<p>In Calgary, Dan was a civilian <i>attached</i> to examine
recruits--and then one day home he came. Angus, reading a paper
on the veranda, looked up at the sound of a step. The train had
just gone through. He was expecting no one. There was Dan, and as
he put down the paper and gazed at his boy, he knew. Dan exuded
it. It was, as they say, writ large on him. It was in the swing
of his shoulders, in the light of his eyes. A promise was a
promise. He had come home to tell them he was going to enlist. He
could not stand it any more--examining men for the army and
sitting there at ease. He had to be out with them, he had to be
there with them.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice Fiona promptly emerged from the
house, got the drift of what had been said on his arrival, and
stood listening to the rest, making unconscious puckerings of her
lips.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose what is to be will be," said Angus. "<i>Ye
ken yer ain ken best, ye ken.</i>"</p>

<p>"We can't go back on it. It's impossible," said Dan. "We
promised Belgium. They are going to need doctors in this
war."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd go as a doctor," said Fiona.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>She was on the point of remarking it would be safer, but there
was that about her son, a light as of the ecstasy of service,
that caused her to leave the words unspoken, with a dread--a
foolish dread, perhaps--that he would whip off and enlist as a
soldier instead.</p>

<p>Angus put a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I remember during the Boer War," said he, "being glad that
you were too young. Now, man, I wish you were too old. But, as
you say, we are committed."</p>

<p>"And even if we were not," replied Dan, "even if we were not,
it's a dirty business--the invasion of Belgium. I'm not sorry I
was too young for the Transvaal. Most people don't look back on
that with any intense pride. But, honest, I'm glad I can be of
use in this."</p>

<br>
<h1>Sacrifice</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Angus was glad, a little later, that they had decided to
settle at High Butte, handy to the reserve. A telephone had been
installed and there was a call from the agency one morning.</p>

<p>"Can you come over at once, Mr. Munro?" said Chantelaine. "I'd
like to see you here."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well--"</p>

<p>"Anybody dead?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no. It's nothing serious--exactly; but I want
your help. A little trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble!"</p>

<p>"Nothing serious," Chantelaine repeated, "though I'd like you
to come at once if you can. Don't ride. Get a car."</p>

<p>Angus 'phoned to the High Butte garage and in five minutes a
taxi was at the door. In three-quarters of an hour he was at the
agency. He liked being here. The old West lingered round the
place. Women in bright shawls were sitting smoking their little
pipes, and groups of men wearing big hats (the leather band
replaced by one of beads, yellow and blue) were waiting, with all
time at disposal, to confer with Chantelaine. Arrived at the
office he saw a mounted-police car at the door; and when he
entered the private room there sat Chantelaine, a Redcoat whom he
knew, and Peter All Alone, silent and sullen in khaki.</p>

<p>"Well, Angus," began the policeman, "Chant' wanted you to be
in on this, so I waited."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"He'll tell you," and the Redcoat nodded to Peter.</p>

<p>Peter told.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he said. "I enlist for war, and I drill and form four,
and two deep, and single file, and say <i>Yes sir, No sir,</i>
and I drill more, and I dig trench like Bohunk and Dago--and walk
and walk! All right. I think maybe by and by I go to war. I go
with company to east. We stop in east, at Valcartier, and dig
trench, and do form four, and bayonet practice on sacks, and walk
every day. No fighting. So I come home."</p>

<p>"There you are," exclaimed Chantelaine. "Q.E.D!"</p>

<p>"There you are!" said the policeman. "He's a deserter. He
wants to fight. He doesn't want to <i>walk.</i> He's liable to be
shot."</p>

<p>Angus frowned at that. Peter was clearly, even in khaki, very
Indian still, and he might take his own life rather than let that
befall if he thought the Redcoat spoke the truth. There had
already, in the Northwest, been a small war of the force with an
Indian and his relatives due to a jest of that sort not
understood by the man who was under arrest for some minor
misdemeanour.</p>

<p>"Oh, they won't do that," said Angus sharply. "What do you
want me for?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have friends. You might get Sir Sam Douglas to put
in a word for him. He's all in the public eye over the Canadian
contingents."</p>

<p>"I'll write a letter to the O.C.," Angus said, "and I'll write
to the Deputy-Minister of Indian Affairs, Duncan Campbell Scott,
in Ottawa, to see what his department can do."</p>

<p>"He's got to go back," announced the policeman. "They are
sending an escort for him. I had only to find out if he was
here."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, Peter, you can't do this. If they say dig,
you've got to dig. If they say form fours, you've got to form
fours."</p>

<p>"I wanna go to fight."</p>

<p>"Yes. That's all right--"</p>

<p>"If you say I should go back, Mr. Munro, I'll go, but I'd a
never enlisted if I had a known I was going to dig and dig and
walk and walk and never fight."</p>

<p>The policeman whooped with joy, though he had heard it all
before Angus came.</p>

<p>Well; that was successful. Away they went, Peter carrying an
explanatory letter from Munro, who also wrote to the department
in Ottawa and direct to the O.C. He would keep Sam, in these days
Sir Samuel Lovat-Douglas, in reserve. Two weeks later he received
a very friendly and understanding reply from the O.C. about
Peter--who was appeased soon, by the departure for England at
least. On Salisbury Plain he became embittered again, digging and
drilling and walking. He wrote about it all to Angus, a letter in
caligraphy and expression scholastically far below the powers of
his young brother, but a gem of human expression.</p>

<p>It was on the day that Dan received this half-querulous,
half-hopeful epistle that Dan came home again. He was in his
uniform with the doctor's tabs. A man grown, he was; and yet here
he was suddenly, for some cause, as a child. He was wanting help:
they knew that and wondered for what distress. Would he go
overseas without broaching it? He did, indeed, himself so wonder,
for it was difficult to broach. Was he nervous? his father asked
himself, and then--no, he decided, he was not that.</p>

<p>"He's feeling badly about going," Fiona thought. "He doesn't
want to break down."</p>

<p>In his eyes was an expression that reminded her at times of
when, a very small boy, he came to have a cut knee bandaged. He
tried to speak to them when they were both together. He tried to
speak to Angus when alone with him, but in the end it was to his
mother, alone with her, that he spoke--suddenly, to get to the
matter that vexed him. He was of a height with her, she a tall
woman, and she was tremendously moved when this son of hers, a
man grown, abruptly put a hand on either shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mother, I want to ask you something," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dan?" There was a light of love on her face. Tears were
very close.</p>

<p>"I've never told you," he said. "There's a girl I'm in love
with. She's a nurse in Calgary. I met her when I was at
McGill."</p>

<p>"I thought there was a girl," she replied.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked, dropping his hands to his side.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear. Sit down and tell me. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "we had an understanding. We were going to
wait till I got on a certain length, but here's this damned war
and our duty. It makes a difference. I think I should wait and
see if I come back. I've put it to her that way. We've talked it
over this way and that. Do you think we should be married before
I go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear boy!" Fiona cried out. "I don't know what to say.
I'll have to ask your father."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Leave it. You know now, anyhow. We're not
going overseas at once. I'll discuss it with Marjory again."</p>

<p>"What is she like?"</p>

<p>"I'll bring her over next time--you'll meet her."</p>

<p>After he had gone back to Calgary, said Fiona to Angus: "Dan's
got a girl. He's going to bring her next time he comes home."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Angus in a quiet voice, and again, "Oh."</p>

<p>When Marjory came they were entirely satisfied with her. Fiona
took her upstairs to show her the spare-room, father and son
looking at the backs of these two as they ascended. They were
chattering gaily together but--neither of the men could have
explained how--something in their shoulders, in their movements,
suggested that up there the door would be shut and there would be
a long talk. And there was.</p>

<p>On the veranda Angus sat staring at the distant mountains,
unconsciously humming to himself and tapping the time with finger
on the chair-arm. Yes, he was getting old. An observer who knew
the story of all there, watching him then, might have recalled
Ian Fraser tapping and humming on the veranda out at the agency.
Dan paced to and fro. Finally he vaulted over the rail and stood
on the lawn looking up at the spare-room window.</p>

<p>"What's keeping you up there?" he called. He came back. "They
don't seem to hear," he complained.</p>

<p>"They're having a crack," answered Angus.</p>

<p>When at last the two women came downstairs--</p>

<p>"Where are you? Ah, there you are--out on the veranda," came
Fiona's voice, very cheery, but they could see by her eyes that
she had been crying. She had an arm round Marjory. "Sit down, my
dear," she said, and went indoors as the girl and Angus began to
talk.</p>

<p>Dan rose and followed her. She suddenly turned, gathered him
into her arms, then thrust him away.</p>

<p>"It's for you two to decide," she told him, and passed into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>They decided. They were married, and what a genial man, what a
gay man was old Angus Munro, in whom some had seen crankiness of
late (though never Fiona), a genial old man at a wedding--for one
must go bravely.</p>

<p>It was a great send-off for the contingent a week later, with
a band playing. When its music ceased, voices began to sing about
it being a long, long way to Tipperary, and others surged up to
drown that out with "O Can-ada, O Can-ada . . . We stand on
guard, We stand on guard for thee!" The coaches rolled out.</p>

<p>A group of officers stood upon the rear platform of the last,
above a placard on which was inscribed <i>To Berlin.</i> Just
visible between the shoulders of those in front, Fiona could see
her son. The rail joints clicked--click, click, click--and there
were more cheers, more tears, as the train dwindled in size,
diminished to a little toy and went from sight.</p>

<p>It was a relief to her to hear later that Dan had been
detained (like Peter) in Eastern Canada. She had a wild impulse
to go and see him there, say good-bye again, an impulse to which
she did not give way. There was relief again for all of them to
learn that he was further detained in England, with his
battalion, on Salisbury Plains.</p>

<p>"About all I do," he wrote, "is to attend to bad feet, and to
men who have a leg or a collar-bone broken in a sack-race. This
place is very much like Southern Alberta. There are long, slow,
rolling hills, and we've brought over our own wagons with the
wide whiffle-trees, making it look more so. If there were only
the Rockies at the end of these plains to complete the illusion,
I'd be absentmindedly jumping in a flivver and coming up to High
Butte to see you. The railway company here has given up trying to
keep the boys from walking on the track. I was in the little town
the other day, at the station, when a lot of them came in, and
the agent--I mean the station-master--gave them a lecture, told
them that some of them would be killed one day. It made me
laugh--the puzzled expression on his face when one of them said,
'You should worry! We're accustomed to hitting the ties.'"</p>

<p>Then they heard from him again, <i>Somewhere in France,</i>
"Very busy. Received your letters."</p>

<p>"Very busy, he says," and Fiona handed the card to Angus.</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that means?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a war on," he replied.</p>

<p>They had many notes, and now and then long letters that said
little about the war. He had seen a bird like a western
meadow-lark; he had seen a place that reminded him of the road
turning off to High Butte, "--where, by the way the brush has
grown, it is like a hedge;" he had made a friend of a doctor with
a battalion of "Jocks" beside them.</p>

<p>"He says he knows Loch Brendan. He took me along to their
mess, introducing me as 'My friend, a Canadian-Scot--'"</p>

<p>That was the last direct communication from him.</p>

<p>The next news they had took them to Calgary; for Marjory would
have it, too.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was over at last, a year after Dan's sacrifice, and Angus's
private opinion was that they had all, in every land, all the
millions of them, died for nothing.</p>

<p>The war years he had felt not as four years but as a period of
misery, as out of hell, driven into the world. Young men who had
been in the Imperial Army were pouring into the country with the
swagger taught them by old soldiers in the training camps; and
most of them, by their manner, had individually won the war, and
had a view that the Dominion was very much a British possession
that they had come to possess. One day he read an article which
stated this and that about the trouble and secret treaties
predating it--and put it in the stove lest Fiona should see it.
It was very depressing.</p>

<p>Fiona had never had an illness apart from the juvenile
maladies of whooping-cough and scarlet fever. The last time she
had a doctor in attendance was at the birth of Dan, and
childbirth is certainly not an obscure disease, not even, rightly
considered, an illness! After the death of Dan she failed, and
when the war ended (or perhaps one should say when word came that
Marjory in Calgary was engaged to be married to a young man who
had recently arrived from the Old Country) there was a quiescence
about her almost as of one defeated. Tulloch was constantly
coming to the house to see her. He advised change of air, so she
went off to Minnesota to visit Flora, but stayed only a week.</p>

<p>"I'm getting now," she said on her return, "so that I like to
be near my own easy-chair."</p>

<p>People were kind to them, knowing how they would feel, the war
over and Dan not back. Hector's elder child--not a child
then--came up to spend a week with them, "a very sweet lass,"
said Angus. She reminded them both of Fiona's mother, even to the
turn of wrist and neck. When she was gone Flora visited them for
a month; and when they were thinking how nice it was to be alone
again, much though they enjoyed seeing these two, Mrs.
Chantelaine arrived in a car and was so kindly pressing that they
packed suitcases and went over to the reserve to spend a few days
there.</p>

<p>"I won't take <i>no</i> for an answer," Mrs. Chantelaine said,
"unless you really don't want to come. The flowers are out along
the coulee and I know you love the sight of them."</p>

<p>While they were at the agency Peter All Alone came home. He
had been with a battalion detained at Rhyl, in North Wales,
awaiting transports. They had made him a sniper, it appeared, but
the old chiefs of the dwindling Warriors' Society in the tribe
were disgusted with much he told them of how the white men fought
over there, so he speedily became a silent veteran.</p>

<p>Much did they talk of the old days on the reserve; and in all
the changes, the improvements, the better homes, the
disappearance of neck sores on the children that had once worried
him, Angus took deep and personal interest. Chantelaine, knowing
his early story, considered that the fact of his eviction at an
impressionable age had much to do with his sympathy for these
people, not evicted but circumscribed. They talked of the
Blackfoot Reserve that Nigel had visited when on a vacation, of
the hospital there maintained out of the tribe's own funds, and
of the agent the Blackfeet had, George Gooderham. Mention of that
hospital brought them back to the All Alone family because of
Louise, who was in those days a qualified nurse with a permanent
position on the reserve.</p>

<p>"Louise All Alone," said Chantelaine, "is halfway between
Peter and young Angus, your namesake. She's pretty, too, and a
fine nurse--but there are lots of Indians these days on a level
with her. Angus is outstanding, of course. I shouldn't be
surprised if he ended in a profession. There have been
professional men already among them, from the Six Nations Reserve
in Ontario to the Gilas in Arizona. And if a Sioux can struggle
up through the hell of their conditions that I've read and heard
about in Dakota to a profession, there is nothing to prevent a
lad like Angus All Alone. Gosh! See who comes!"</p>

<p>An agency truck had driven up to the door of the storehouse,
and coming across from it was Angus All Alone, carrying a
suitcase. His grandfather watched him from the window.</p>

<p>"He must have been coming back and got a lift," observed
Chantelaine.</p>

<p>They heard voices in the outer office, the clerk talking out
there. Then the door of the private room opened, and the new man
(Murray had been transferred to another reserve) stepped in.</p>

<p>"Are you too busy to see Angus?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Send him in," replied Chantelaine.</p>

<p>Young Angus entered.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Mr. Munro!" he exclaimed. "I was going to call and see
you in High Butte before coming out, but there was a truck just
leaving, so I came on it." He looked very happy. "Just back from
High School," he explained.</p>

<p><i>Just back from high school.</i> How time was bridged ever
and again at a scent, a sound, a word. Angus Munro recalled this
stripling's father coming in at the front door with a policeman,
back from <i>doing time,</i> recalled how he had been sitting
there with a white-fatherly homily all prepared, and how it was
scattered to the winds at a lively "Just back from college!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, my boy," said Angus. "Sit down and tell us all
about it."</p>

<p>It was a heartening, and more an astonished than a boastful
report. Young All Alone was top of his class in most subjects,
near the top in all.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you now, sir," he admitted, "that I had
considerable difficulties at first. The reserve school did not
prepare me for everything at high school. I have had to think not
as an Indian."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Well, take <i>physics</i> for example, sir. There isn't a
word except one in Cree for all the new words I've had to learn
for physics alone."</p>

<p>"Oh? And that word--?"</p>

<p>"Mystery."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Munro. "What do you think you will make of it
all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but whatever I decide it has been a great
experience. I've been thinking that I'd like to take up
flying."</p>

<p>"Flying!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, not for good--as a means to an end, to put myself
through university. Flying is pretty well paid and I'd like to
pay my own fees. I have a friend in Calgary. He's clerking in a
drug store to make money to study for a medico. I want to go up
with him."</p>

<p>"You want to be a doctor?"</p>

<p>"You bet."</p>

<p>A doctor! That was Dan's profession. Angus looked past young
All Alone out of the window, meditatively. Where did this
predilection originate? he wondered, and recalled his mother with
her knowledge of herbs and medicinal roots, of simples, her
prescriptions for ailing neighbours in the old days at Loch
Brendan. Dan a doctor, Louise a nurse, and now this youth talking
of wanting to be a <i>medico!</i></p>

<p>"Well, I could speak to Sir Samuel Douglas about an aircraft
job," he said. "You know, Sir Samuel Lovat-Douglas, chairman of
<i>Arctic and Border Airways</i>."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you. Mr. Munro. I've got a job for this
summer, anyhow, a vacation job."</p>

<p>"You have?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A very interesting man came to lecture to us about the
geology of the district, and I'm to drive a car for him for two
months in the field--in the Red Deer River country."</p>

<p>"The Red Deer River! What's he doing there?"</p>

<p>"He's making excavations. They have discovered prehistoric
creatures, fossilized, creatures of the pterodactyl sort--"</p>

<p>"They have!" exclaimed Angus, and his mind was back to the
cabin at Rocky Mountain House, and he was listening to strange
stories of Minota's--wild legends he had thought them. "They
have!" he ejaculated again.</p>

<p>The door opened again and the clerk looked in.</p>

<p>"There's Dick Beaver going by in a rig," he said to young All
Alone. "He goes your way, if you want a lift."</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me, Mr. Munro, if I beat it now?"</p>

<p>"Come and see me again," said Chantelaine.</p>

<p>"Sure! And I'll see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be here some days yet," Chantelaine
interjected.</p>

<p>"We mustn't stay too long," Angus told him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll either see you here or at your home in High
Butte," said young All Alone.</p>

<p>The clerk had dashed out and was shouting to Dick Beaver to
wait.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my boy," said Angus, getting stiffly to his
feet. He lifted both hands in air in the old sign, greatly moved,
and looked after the lad as he ran, suitcase in hand, to the
waiting wagon, Nigel watching his old chief and thinking how much
he had his heart in the job.</p>

<p>They were happy days at the reserve for all. Fiona sat with
Mrs. Chantelaine, a sewing-basket by her side, on the seat under
the cotton poplar clump. From there she could see the pools and
streamers of the wild flowers along the coulee bottom one way
and, the other, the high peaks of the mountains, their
promontories jutting into the foothills, for it was halcyon
weather.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chantelaine took them for drives in the car away off the
reserve and through the Mennonite settlement. It had been bald
prairie there once, then there had been dotted houses and anon
round each house little twigs of trees. No houses were visible as
they came to the ridge overlooking the Mennonites' domain that
summer, not even a twinkle of sun in a window to indicate where
they were. The bunches of twigs of a few years back were trees,
dotted copses (<i>shelter brakes</i>) round the homes. They were
very happy, but even so Fiona was not loath to be back in her own
easy-chair again.</p>

<p>As they had once noticed, on a visit to the old folk at High
River, a sudden change in the Frasers, the static period over, so
did the Chantelaines, on that visit, notice a change in them.
Suddenly they had aged--but, then, there had been the war, and
Dan's death. There had also been the speedy engagement (and
marriage) of Marjory, which, perhaps, had hurt Fiona a little,
though of that their friends knew nothing.</p>

<p>Talking over their visit, the Mennonites' farms and much else
that proclaimed the flight of time, said Fiona: "All the changes
make me feel old--near an end," she added.</p>

<p>That was a speech too serious to take seriously.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," he replied, and laughed. "I may put you to bed
yet, lass, though I'm over ten years older than you."</p>

<p>She laughed back at him, realizing that he felt the subject
too deep to talk of save jestingly.</p>

<p>"I would like to be the last to go," thought he. "I would not
like to leave her alone. One can make happiness but, the way
things are now, it's often not a happy world. Yes," he went on,
aloud, "I'd like to tuck you up for the night and see ye
comfortably bedded, whatever."</p>

<p>"Oh, tut! And what would you do left alone with nobody to darn
your socks?"</p>

<p>"Sit and smoke my pipe with none to bother me!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll not talk about it," said she, suddenly veering
from the view that its seriousness necessitated pretence of
levity. "It's no matter to be joking on."</p>

<p>"It's too sad to do anything else but joke on, my lass. God
bless you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll go together," she said.</p>

<p>But the blue gentians had just faded and the prairie asters of
that year were blooming again, as through ages they had bloomed
there--ribands of them by the mile drawn along the sides of the
motor roads for a wild border--when she went alone.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c34">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Angus and Sam</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They called him <i>Old Man Munro</i> after that. When we mourn
for the dead, he told himself, we really mourn for ourselves,
missing them. He was glad she had gone first. It was lonesome
with one's partner away, but he had more faith in future than
present, whatever followed.</p>

<p>He became as a certain group of elders among his late wards:
he lived in the past--several jumps to rear. Every now and then
an Indian's horse would be seen standing at the veranda's end, or
a patched democrat wagon, signifying that he had callers from the
reservation. One or two even came in cars sometimes, but not All
Alone. He did a little business with the High Butte General Store
in beaded moccasins or fringed gauntlets. Tourists passing
through would buy a pair for two dollars. It was a "fifty-fifty"
trade, the storekeeper paying the chief a dollar a pair or giving
him credit to that amount for goods--and how he and his wife
loved oranges! They never drove into High Butte with these things
but they came to smoke with Angus--good friends, these, as the
years passed. There was occult comfort for Munro in these visits
of Minota's son.</p>

<p>"Mistah Chief All 'Lone and Misses Chief All 'Lone come see
you!" Mah Yip would chant in the doorway, always glad to see
them, knowing that their visits cheered the old man.</p>

<p>From his window one day he saw odd movements of two men,
peered at them across distance. It looked as if one was
threatening the other with fierce gestures, then the other waved
his arms in air, and next they both moved on together. There was
not another war; those were not recruits practising flag-wagging.
The truth suddenly dawned upon him: He recalled that he had given
a donation toward founding the High Butte Golf Club, helping
toward initial payment on a course. Calgary and Edmonton had
theirs long ago.</p>

<p>This shocked him. Stunned, the old man turned from the window,
picturing that little play-ball bouncing among these undulations
across which (not unprepared for having at least to temporize
with some band of roving Blackfeet prowling north into Cree
country for horses, if not for scalps) he and Sam Douglas had
ridden--ages past.</p>

<p>It eased him somewhat to have Sam back again. Sam still had
many "interests," was not only president of <i>Western Oils
Limited</i>, the head office of which, demanding his presence
there during the war years, was in London, but he was also
chairman of <i>Arctic and Border Airways,</i> known as <i>The
A.B.,</i> and when he was elected to that position he returned to
Calgary. There Angus discussed with him the possibility of
getting young All Alone into the service.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly. I'll tell them to expect him and to
take him on. It'll be mechanic's work at first, of course, but
I'll tell them."</p>

<p>"He's a marvel in a motor car," said Angus proudly, "one of
the finest drivers I've ever seen, and if anything goes wrong
with one of the big combines at the harvesting out at the reserve
he can crawl around and tinker it."</p>

<p>"Send him along. I'll tell them to keep an eye on him. Man,
you are awful keen on your Indians! I'll see to it," he said with
finality, and flung off into a tirade over a trifle perhaps to
some but to him clearly not so.</p>

<p>He had been down to the coast, to Vancouver, and a train man
in the Kicking Horse Pass had pointed out to him a rock there
telling him it had given the place its name.</p>

<p>"He tried to make me see it was the shape of a kicking horse.
'Nonsense!' I says to him. I told him the true story that you and
I know--how Dr. Hector (him that later became Sir James Hector,
governor of the Windward Islands), when he was out in the
mountains with Captain Palliser, got kicked over a cliff there by
a baulky horse. But I doubted if I did any good. He'll keep that
rock to show to the tourists. Och, aye! The old days are dust,
Angus. The Ten Peaks in there that were named by the Stoneys in
their tongue, one to ten, they are giving new fancy names to.
It's as bad as that attempt a while back to obliterate the good
old name of <i>Medicine Hat.</i> Medicine Hat--I hope they keep
it to tell folks a thousand years hence what we won't be here to
tell them."</p>

<p>"That's a long jump ahead," said Angus.</p>

<p>The next time Old Man Munro went to see Sam about Angus All
Alone he did not go to his house. He went to the office, for he
did not like the duty that carried him there. He walked slowly
from his hotel, deep in thought. Motor cars in ribbons along the
streets, came to a halt before <i>silent policemen,</i> and moved
on again. The bells of electric streetcars clanged, adding their
imperative clash to the honkings. The sidewalks were agog from
shop-fronts to curb, and it seemed that all the languages of
Europe were being spoken round him, from Finnish to Greek, from
Gallician to Ukrainian. A metropolis! He recalled Douglas's
prophesies that so it would be, made in days of long ago. A
polyglot metropolis: that's what Calgary was!</p>

<p>Tall new steel blocks were being built to the din of electric
hammers driving home the rivets. At a crossing he suddenly
discovered that a car, turning into the side street there, was
creeping slow behind him. He stepped on smartly, and in doing so,
with a glance over his shoulder noticed that the driver was
Marjory. She waved a hand to him, but of course could not stop,
because other cars were close, taking the turn. He waved too, and
bowed, standing on the curb. There was the Hudson's Bay Company's
store, a tall block, very different from the log-cabin he had
seen on his arrival to meet Sam, riding in from the Mountain
House.</p>

<p>A few blocks further on he turned into a tiled hallway, where
a revolving doorway was constantly spinning to exits and
entrances, and glanced at the rubric on a wall. Yes: <i>Second
Floor, Arctic and Border Airways.</i> Four elegant elevator doors
gleamed in a row to one side. A trig young woman in uniform,
wearing rakishly a jaunty cap, sang to him: "Going
<i>up</i>?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. Second floor."</p>

<p>"Second floor!"</p>

<p>Angus stepped out of the lift and read the legends on the
glass doors. <i>General office.</i> He entered and--</p>

<p>"Sir Samuel Lovat-Douglas in?" he asked a clerk.</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. Tell him it is Mr. Munro--Mr. Angus Munro."</p>

<p>The clerk departed toward the inner corridor. As Angus waited
he heard many typewriters clicking and the noise, without, of
riveting.</p>

<p>"Come this way, please, sir."</p>

<p>He was ushered into Sam's room. The chairman sat in a
revolving chair beyond a gleaming table.</p>

<p>"Well, Angus!" he exclaimed. "Sit ye doon. Grand tae see ye at
any time. Sit ye doon--no, not in that chair. That's for business
people and people wanting something out of me." He rose. "We'll
sit down here," and he passed to a divan that stood between two
bright windows.</p>

<p>There they subsided.</p>

<p>"There's something on your mind," said Sam, producing a
cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is it? Can I help?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is about <i>A.B. Airways'</i> matters."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"I've been hearing a lot about them from men who know. I can't
think it's malicious gossip."</p>

<p>"Out with it, man!" Sam did not open his cigar-case but sat
there playing with it, slapping a hand with it.</p>

<p>"They say"--Angus paused--"they say the machines go up not
airworthy."</p>

<p>"Do they?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They say that <i>A.B.</i> buys discarded machines--"</p>

<p>"--and mends them, and mends them!" interrupted Douglas.
"Makes them as good as new. What's all this about? Did you come
to warn me for my good name's sake? If so--I've heard it all
before,"</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, it's this way," said Angus. "You can get tri-motor
all-metal planes, yet you are using one-engined, water-cooled
planes."</p>

<p>"I know it. Do you think <i>A.B.</i> can afford these grand
machines?"</p>

<p>"Maybe not," Angus replied, "but why send young men up in
buses, as they call them, that are not guaranteed even for the
rises they have to make in the over-mountains work? I forget the
word."</p>

<p><i>"Ceiling,</i> I believe," supplied Douglas.</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"But what's--what's all this for? You will be wanting me to
have wireless operators in them all and--"</p>

<p>"And they have to tinker their engines," went on Angus, "with
hay-wire."</p>

<p><i>Hay-wire</i> annoyed Sam, for there was a slang phrase of
the land, <i>A hay-wire outfit.</i></p>

<p>"Come to the point, man," he said, testily. "I'm thinking,
Sam, of Angus All Alone--that lad I got in with you about a year
or so ago. He's flying now."</p>

<p>"Oh, that Indian lad! Well well. The pilots have the nerve to
go up in anything. Fine boys, fine boys!"</p>

<p>"Because they have the nerve," demanded Angus, "should they be
asked to do it, take such risks?" Sam cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about this," he said. "I never expected it from
you. You spoke for him, and he's been pushed along ahead of
others, and now you come and talk to me as if I was ruthless.
He's--all--right! The machines are safe enough. It's your
<i>Indian kink,</i> Angus, run away with you."</p>

<p>"'Kink?' Well--" Angus paused.</p>

<p>"Aye?"</p>

<p>"He's my grandson--<i>that Indian lad."</i></p>

<p>"Your grandson! Well, I'm--" Sam stood up. "Well, I'm--" he
sat down. "What do you know about that!" he ejaculated in a
phrase more exclamatory than inquiring. "Well, what do you know
about that!" and he got up and walked to the wall, carefully
straightening a picture that some part of him had amazingly
noticed was a little out of plumb, unaware what he did. He came
back and stood over Angus. "Yon bonny brown wench ye had in your
cabin at the Mountain House--there was a child?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Sam pointed a finger at him.</p>

<p>"Minota!" he chanted. "Minota!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I remember the name. It just came to me."</p>

<p>He felt in a pocket for his cigar-case, which had slipped down
at the back of the divan, seated himself beside Angus again, gave
up the quest for the cigars and laid a hand on his friend's
forearm, pressing it in assurance.</p>

<p>"Angus," said he. "Now, honestly, I don't know--or I
didn't--much about the machines. I'm only the chairman, after
all, I'm not the engineer in charge. I know but little about the
airplanes. I've never felt it was for me to inquire. But I tell
you what I'll do. I'll have a chat with my executive head about
it. I'll admit he has told me he hoped our political opponents
would not get to know certain things, but I haven't troubled to
inquire just what. Your grandson, eh? Well, you have kept your
thumb on it." He paused, meditatively. "And I have kept my thumb
on your having an Indian woman in the old days, seeing I never
heard you mention it."</p>

<p>Somehow Angus was reminded, sitting there, of humping down
beside Sir Ernest Reynolds on all that remained of the wall of
the house where he was born by Loch Brendan.</p>

<p>"Aye," Sam continued, "I'll see about what you've been talking
of. As a matter of fact, I've heard other hints and I have been
thinking we'd better improve our machines before some paper gets
noisy about it. I've got to thank you for coming to me with this,
Angus. Have a cigar. Where did I put that case? Here it is.
Cigar? No, no, it's lunchtime. We'll go and have lunch at the
Club. My wife is away awhile visiting in Ottawa."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Angus All Alone, having sedulously saved
his pence, left the <i>Airways</i> service on the next
commencement at McGill, going to Montreal with that drugstore
clerk who was then in a similar position with at least sufficient
funds, if not affluence. He called on old Angus at High Butte
before his departure,</p>

<p>"If I get through all right," he said, "some day I hope to be
with the department, in one of the agency hospitals. I'd like to
be in the service. I sometimes think, if you don't mind my saying
so, sir, that the Indian blood--well, it has its own strength. I
don't believe my people are a dying race, going out in misery
everywhere."</p>

<p>It was a talk that, when the young man was gone, jogged Angus
to many memories--memories of Dan's ambition (not ambition enough
to please his friend Sam Douglas), memories of Buffalo Calf
talking of how the Indian blood is strong. Recalling Buffalo Calf
brought to mind Gus Atkins--and where, he wondered, was he? Once
or twice they had met since '77. Gus must have retired from the
police force long since. Angus wished they had kept in touch.</p>

<p>He passed into a reverie of men he had known and liked, yet
lost touch with, thought of Buchanan of the old Red River
flat-boats and the boat-building on Saskatchewan's headwaters.
The last he had heard of him was from Sam, ratifying a rumour
that he was piloting a stern-wheeler on the Fraser River, Douglas
having seen him there when he first went to the Cariboo country.
Buchanan, thought he, must be dead. "We've all got to come to
it," as Sam had said, almost cheerfully, commiserating with him
when Fiona's mother went.</p>

<p>Mah Yip came in, and seeing him sitting deep in thought,
summoned him.</p>

<p>"No mo' ladio?" he asked. "Why you nevah listen ladio, Mistah
Munlo? Ladio all same lot of people come alound. You tly! You no
likee, all light--you tu'n off. You listen ladio!"</p>

<h1><a name="c35">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</a></h1>

<br>
<h1>Voice of the Prairie</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The radio had been a present he had given to Fiona. They had
never been able to take that small polished box for granted.
Always it was <i>Mystery</i>, and they would often wonder what
kindred and further marvels awaited in the future. Since she went
he had hardly touched it, but to humour Mah Yip, recognizing kind
solicitude in his manner, he switched it on.</p>

<p>"This is Calgary speaking--C.F.C.N.--the Voice of the Prairie.
We regret to announce that the talk promised for this evening by
Sir Samuel Lovat-Douglas on <i>Reminiscences of the Old
West</i>"--(imagine Sam talking of the Past instead of the
Future!)--"will have to be postponed, Sir Samuel having been
taken ill suddenly this afternoon. We are sure that all his old
friends wish Sam a speedy recovery."</p>

<p>The wish of his old friends was not gratified. In the papers
the obituary notices read, <i>Suddenly . . . at his residence in
Calgary.</i> But, sudden though it had been, that man of method
had all arranged, even to a list of pallbearers and honorary
pallbearers, and an additional list lest any of those named in
the first should be unable to see him to the grave. Always a
<i>jump ahead</i> was Sam.</p>

<p>Some of the newspaper headings disgusted Angus. He never liked
such titles as <i>Grim Reaper Takes . . . Old Timer Answers Last
Call</i> . . . Grim Reaper! Sam's own attitude to that inevitable
was always so much to the tune of "It comes to us all," and he
was of such an age that it was, as one old friend said, almost a
cheerful funeral. He had lived his life, a full life, and was
looked upon as somewhat of a Character by many which (despite his
descent to a title) he would prefer to being considered a
Personage.</p>

<p>There was no slow trudge of bearers, no halting at the
intoning of <i>Relief!</i> He lay in his coffin in a dress-suit,
and those who cared could pass in file to look their last on him.
Angus did not. He wanted to retain other memories of Sam--of Sam
alive, moving, throwing back his head to laugh, trying to coax
the Glasgow bailies--to humbug them some would have said. The
most expensive undertaker and the most fashionable clerics put
him to bed. Angus wondered what, honestly if privately, he would
have thought of the service. Sam, no doubt, had his own thoughts
about much but he always did the established thing. They were far
from each other in some ways, these two friends who had often
come very close in the flying of the years. To Sam, he recalled,
he had on an impulse divulged a secret he had not shared with his
loved wife--the secret of All Alone.</p>

<p>When the body was resurrected would the dress-suit be
resurrected, too? Thoughts of all sorts, queer and not queer,
whimsical and serious, passed through Angus's mind during the
formal ceremony. The pageant seemed ghoulish to old Munro and
when he died he hoped there would be no such prolonged harrowing
of any who might have cared for him. Death needed not that. He
consoled himself by thinking that, after all, all the clerics had
there was the body. The spirit was off and away. He remembered
that Socrates said, when asked how he would be buried, "You will
have to catch me first." Then somehow--perhaps in part, after
all, because of the pageantry of it--the harrowing quality
diminished. It became almost a genial funeral. Sam had lived his
life, and he had died easy, not slowly in a weary sick-bed.</p>

<p>After all was over one of the other honorary pallbearers, who
had glanced at Angus once or twice during the spectacle, stepped
to him.</p>

<p>"I believe you've forgotten me," he said. He was a lean man of
stiff erect carriage, with scanty gray hairs and gray face.</p>

<p>"Gus Atkins!" exclaimed Angus.</p>

<p>"Yes. Still alive but not kicking violently. I'm glad I didn't
have to help to lift him even onto that butler's-wagon thing.
Here's a car to take us back to town. Get in with me, will
you?"</p>

<p>Both had commissions in the city's centre, so alighted there,
Angus remembering at his shopping (his life going on as usual),
Big Beaver's remark: "If I am not here next year I hope your
hunting will be good." He felt as though he were somewhat of a
ghost over these purchasings.</p>

<p>"That all?" asked Gus.</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"All mine, too. Where are you putting up?"</p>

<p>"The Palliser."</p>

<p>"The Palliser. You used to go to the Alberta."</p>

<p>"Yes, and before that the Potter House."</p>

<p>"That's right, too--the old Potter House. Gosh, what
changes!"</p>

<p>As they walked they talked easily of the dead, or Gus did and
Angus listened.</p>

<p>"We've all got to come to it," said the graying Atkins. "It's
good not to be bedridden long, and he was an old man, and he had
a damn good time. He was a good boss and a good friend, and as
years went on, a mellow and easy-oasy enemy. Bit of a humbug,
perhaps, but another way of looking at that is that he liked to
get through without trouble. <i>Plausible,</i> some said, and
others said <i>genial.</i> Some said <i>all for himself.</i> He
really wasn't all for himself with everybody. I know that. Yeah,
he was a great card. I'm sorry he's gone."</p>

<p>They moved on and came to the hotel. Angus liked it for many
reasons, and one was its name. Palliser must really have been on
his way west, across the plains and through the mountains, when
the coronach by Loch Brendan played the Munros to their exile.
True he had eventually presented a report against the building of
a railway, but that was because he could see "no immediate
advantage commensurate with the required sacrifice of capital."
The words came back to Angus's mind, remembering the past.</p>

<p>But who, thought he, would have dreamt then (in the days when
Palliser had to spend a winter with Old Sun of the Blackfeet,
that the tribesmen might know him and let him be at his
surveying) of this? Did even Sam Douglas with all his hopes and
prophesies?</p>

<p>They had afternoon tea--Gus and Angus (<i>Afternoon tea!</i>
How queer it seemed when thinking of the old days)--in the tall
hotel of the reverie-creating name. Then it was time for Gus to
go to catch his train. He had retired at Banff.</p>

<p>"Come and see me sometime," said he as they walked to the
door. There he held out his hand, and added, imitating a voice
they would hear no more: "It's grr-and tae have seen ye again,
Angus!"</p>

<p>"Grand to have seen you, Gus."</p>

<p>Angus walked back into the long lounge and, sitting down
there, told himself that he was old. Gus Atkins was much his
junior, and he was gray. There he called up the ghosts, the
<i>shadows,</i> from the years that had flown. Fiona he had no
need to call. She, it seemed, was always with him--in a blessed
dispensation of Providence. She retained for him, in her ghostly
companionship, a feeling that all was not agley, despite the fact
that the brief post-war sense of relief and hope had ebbed,
leaving depression. The overflowing happiness of her youth
remained with him, the dismissing gentleness of her middle years
that made acrimony barren, her refusal to be implicated in
acerbities. When, meditating there, he put a hand out to one side
on the couch, it was as though he laid it on hers, she sitting
there with him, though to the head-porter in his niche he was but
an old man sitting alone, absently turning a collet ring round
and round on his little finger.</p>

<p>Old man Buchanan was there. Fiona's father and mother were
there for him. Minota of the dark, candid eyes, the views that to
one of the twentieth century were na&iuml;vet&eacute;'s, the
simplicities that to foolish folk would be foolishness--she was
there. All these came to him in the beauty of remembered mornings
and noons, of dusks that were eternal. He thought of the caulked
cabin at Rocky Mountain House, heard the hum of the Franklin
stove, heard again, in his other cabin beyond Jasper, the blue
jays raucously demanding breakfast, recalled, across the years,
his misery there on a certain regrettable occasion.</p>

<p>Some music broke out. He thought of a sea loch of Scotland,
with a sense of instability, a sickness under his heart. He had
no place--no place. There was no ground under his feet. The place
of his birth was a tangle of bracken. He had no place--no place.
There was no ground under his feet. A faintness came to him. Oh,
well--we come and we go, through various vicissitudes, and it is
all one where our bones lie at the end of the strange dream. He
drew a long, trembling breath. He glanced this way and that,
wondering where was the orchestra. A Japanese attendant came
running to him.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wondered where the music was coming from," replied
Angus.</p>

<p>"I shall find out, sir."</p>

<p>Had he never come to this land he would never have met Fiona,
so he dismissed from his mind that memory, in the music, of a
distant sea loch, its scents and sounds. After all, it was in the
mind one lived, not on a certain given acre of the world.</p>

<p>The porter returned.</p>

<p>"New York, sir, relayed from Salt Lake City."</p>

<p>"Oh--radio."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The music again took him far: He was in Edinburgh, sitting
with Fiona and Dan at the Buffalo Bill show. It ceased and he
remained there talking to Hill Burton. Outside there was a wind
shrilling in the chimney pots of Auld Reekie. It would be
<i>nice,</i> he considered, to live in one's own country. Still,
he had grown to love this one, and Fiona, born at Red River, had
come to love the west. The scent of crushed sage-brush she loved,
aromatic sage.</p>

<p>Other music came, and he was riding up the north bank of the
Bow with Gus Atkins (ruddy of hair, ruddy of face) after having
unpacked the horses beside the Redcoats' camp. Then the lounge of
the Palliser was full of voices for him, the voices of Sarcee
Indians and of Stoneys (Minota's mother was a Stoney) riding
through. They were all painted and feathered. Bells were on the
horses' bridles. They came jogging from the ballroom to west
toward the dining-room to east. People going in to early dinner
did not see them, only he. The early diners surrendered their
coats and hats to the tall girl at the cloak alcove, and the
head-waiters received them with a bow and a salute of menu card;
but the Sarcees and the Stoneys rode on, trailing travois,
lodge-poles, raising the dust on their way to that great
gathering at Blackfoot Crossing in '77. The elevators hummed up
and down, with a smooth click opened to deposit those guests who
descended and to receive those who waited--click and hum. The
horses whinnied as they passed, or cleared their throats of a
husk, and there was laughter in the cavalcade, "the sweet
laughter of Indian women."</p>

<p>He came back with a gasp to the present, saw the reflected
lights in tiles of the lounge between the rugs, the glow of the
lamps on the polished woods.</p>

<p>"Shadows," said the old man, talking to himself, sitting
there. "Shadows!"</p>

<p>Well, like Sam's, his life had been a full one, thought he,
reviewing there the flying years. In his mind there was a
sanctuary, with these for company. Soon he must be going. He
looked up at the clock. How quickly time passed! He rose, a
little stiffly, and went tapping over the tiles to catch his
train home.</p>
