<h1>HOW HE CAME TO OUR TOWN ON A STORMY NIGHT AND FOUND
UNEXPECTEDLY A HOME</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On a December night in the year 1906 a ferocious storm swept
across our town.</p>

<p>There was nothing unusual in this: in Southern Glebeshire the
winter is so often mild that the sea (impatient at the lassitude
of the air) seems suddenly to rise, and to wish to beat its way
across the narrow peninsula, to sweep the fields and hedges with
its salt water: it calls the heavens to its assistance, the skies
open, water pours out in torrents, the wind screams, shrieks,
bellows--suddenly it knows that all is vanity, shrugs its hoary
shoulders, creeps back muttering, lifts its hand to the sky in a
gesture of cynical farewell, and lies, heaving, hoping for a more
victorious day.</p>

<p>In the weeks around Christmas there is often such a storm,
and, when other parts of England are showing gratitude
sentimentally for the traditional snow, we recover from our
torrents of rain to find the air warm, our skies mildly blue, the
tower of our Cathedral stretching pearl-grey to heaven, and the
Pol rumpled with sunshine sliding to the sea.</p>

<p>But the storm while it lasts seems to shake our town to its
very roots; you can almost feel wild hands tearing at the stones
beneath your feet, rocking, rocking, rocking, hoping that at
least one house may tumble. . . .</p>

<p>On this especial evening, December 22, 1906, Mrs. Penethen, a
well-known and respected widow, was sitting in front of her
kitchen fire, her skirt drawn up to her knees, her toes resting
on a wool-worked cushion, in her old old house in Canon's Yard.
The houses in Canon's Yard are, as every one knows, the oldest in
Polchester, and Mrs. Penethen's was possibly the oldest in
Canon's Yard, so you can guess from that how old it was.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen had lived in that house for forty years: she had
come into that same kitchen with the brown splashes on the
ceiling and the two big warming-pans on the right of the oven
when she was a blushing bride of twenty; she had borne two
children in the four-poster upstairs, she had nursed her husband
in the weeks of his fever, had seen him laid in his coffin, had
seen the coffin carried down the crooked black oak staircase--and
now there she sat with her feet upon the fender reading
<i>Thelma,</i> by Miss Marie Corelli, and wondering whether she
would hear the Cathedral clock strike ten through the storm.</p>

<p>She was not alone in the kitchen. There were also with her a
cat, a dog and a sharp-eyed girl. The cat and the dog were
asleep, one on either side of the fire; the girl was
sitting-staring straight before her. Her hands were clasped, not
tightly, on her lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen was accustomed that her daughter Judy, who was
now twenty-one and should know better, should sit for hours,
saying nothing, doing nothing, only her eyes and her rising,
falling breasts moving.</p>

<p>Through the icy cold and black waters of <i>Thelma's</i>
theatrical lumber her mind moved searching for her children. She
was always carried away by anything that she read--that was why
she liked novels, especially did they lead her into loves and
countries that were strange to her. So she had, during the last
two hours, been wandering with Thelma; her daughter's eyes now
dragged her back. Fifteen years of married life and no child! All
thought of one abandoned--and then Maude. Four more years and
then Judy. One more year and the sudden fever, and poor old John
with his brown eyes, his side-whiskers and the slight hunch on
his left shoulder, shoved down into the ground!</p>

<p>The book slipped on to her lap. She stared into the crimson
crystal coals. John! . . . His hand was on her arm, his soft
voice like a lazy cat's begging her pardon for one of his so many
infidelities. He always confessed to her. At first she had been
unhappy; once she had run away for two nights, but he always told
her that he loved her far the best, that she would outlast all
the others. And she did. He was her lover to the very end, and
kind and tender. . . . His brown eyes and the slight hunch on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>He had been so sorry always for his infidelities, but he had
never promised that there would not be another. He knew that he
could not resist. . . . Here, in Polchester, there had never been
a scandal because of him. Women loved him and kept their mouths
shut. Not as she had loved him. Not as she had kept her mouth
shut. Shut for forty years. That was why they called her a bitter
old woman. She put up her hand to her hair. Perhaps she was
bitter. Indifferent. She did not believe in people. Cats and
monkeys, she had read somewhere. . . . Only in novels were they
fine and noble.</p>

<p>She picked up <i>Thelma</i> again, saying as she did so:</p>

<p>"Do you think the Cathedral's struck ten, Judy?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the girl.</p>

<p>"It's time Maude was home!"</p>

<p>The girl said nothing.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fletch is bringing her back."</p>

<p>The girl said nothing.</p>

<p>She read half a page, and the storm forced her to put the book
down again. She looked up, listening, rather like a dog sniffing,
with her grey hair parted, her fine sharp nose, her cool chin,
her long shapely neck wrinkled a little now above the white
collar of her grey dress, her hands long and thin, one like a
spread fan before the fire. The storm! One of the worst for
years. Every window-pane and door in the old house was whining
and shivering. The gusts of wind came down the chimney, bringing
with them flurries of rain that spluttered upon the coals. She
heard a door banging somewhere above in the house. She got up,
the book falling on the floor. She listened. Dimly through all
the noise she heard the Cathedral chimes strike ten. Strange how
dim when the Cathedral was almost next to their own house-wall!
She stood listening. Was there not another sound? Some one
knocking? She turned back to the room:</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything, Judy?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head impatiently. Mrs. Penethen took the
lamp from the table, went to the kitchen door and opened it. She
stood in the little dark space between the two doors, listening,
the lamp raised. The storm had suddenly died down, running now
like an animal whimpering about the room.</p>

<p>Now unmistakably there was a knock on the outer door--a pause,
and then two more. With her free hand she pulled back a bolt,
turned a key and opened the door a little way. A man was standing
there. She always afterwards remembered that he had seemed there
in the darkness, lit only by gleams from the blowing street lamp,
gigantic.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The figure stepped forward.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked more sharply, drawing back. The
scurrying rain was keen against her face, and the wind, rising
once more, blew her clothes against her legs.</p>

<p>"I want some supper and a bed." He drew nearer to her, and she
saw that he was carrying a bag. She realised instantly that his
voice was a foreigner's.</p>

<p>"I have nothing here," she answered sharply.</p>

<p>"There is a card," he said, raising one arm, "in your window.
It says 'Spare room for gentleman.'"</p>

<p>The storm was now shouting at them, trying to drive them in.
"There is no room," she screamed against the storm.
"Engaged."</p>

<p>Then she saw his face as he stepped back beneath the street
lamp. It was the face of a boy. She had expected some foreigner,
some hulking tramp threatening her. She was not afraid; she had
only once or twice in all her life known fear. She knew how to
protect herself. But now suddenly she realised that there was no
need for protection--no need at all. Then she remembered that the
voice had been soft, foreign, but an educated voice.</p>

<p>She moved back carefully into the house. "You had better come
in for a moment out of this," she said, raising the lamp.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, and followed her in.</p>

<p>In the kitchen there was the light of the fire and the steady
flame of the lamp set now on the table. She looked at him
sharply, keenly, as she always looked at every one.</p>

<p>She saw now that he was not gigantic but tall indeed, well
over six foot. Broad with it. Very broad in the oilskins that he
was wearing, the collar turned up high and a seaman's oilskin cap
on his head low down over his brow. The first thing that she
noticed seriously was the child-like face shining with the rain
through the oilskin. It was as though a boy had dressed in his
father's clothes. But he was not a boy. Thirty, perhaps, or more.
The mouth which turned up at the corners now, smiling, was a
boy's mouth. The eyes were bright blue and clear. A lock of damp
black hair straggled down beneath the cap, touching his
eyebrow.</p>

<p>He made a movement with his hand to push it back.</p>

<p>"You'd better take that oilskin off," she said severely.
"You're dripping."</p>

<p>"I don't hope," he said in a voice rather husky, with a
foreign accent that puzzled her because it was strangely
familiar, "that you'll think me rude for coming at this hour. My
heartliest thanks for your courtesy."</p>

<p>He suddenly clicked his heels and bowed stiffly from the waist
up in what she supposed was German fashion, in what at any rate
was not English. Then he took off his oilskins, piling them on a
chair. He was dressed in a decent dark-blue suit. He was
certainly a very large man, as broad as he was tall. He was not
fat, but his face was chubby, rosy and plump, his blue eyes
staring with a little blinking bewilderment as though he were in
truth a small boy suddenly wakened from sleep. He was a man
though. He stood like a man, a little on the defensive, balanced
stoutly on his legs, ready for any one. Perhaps he <i>was</i> a
German, with his bow and his chubby cheeks, his blue eyes and his
thick body. She didn't like Germans.</p>

<p>"You can rest here a minute or two if you care to," she said,
"but you'd better be getting on soon if you're wanting a bed
to-night." She looked at him, then added: "There's a hotel down
in the town. In the market-place. Down the hill."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smiling at her, "I were there and all was
engaged." He smiled so that she was compelled to smile too. She
did not wish to. She was compelled. Then suddenly he saw
Judy.</p>

<p>"My daughter," Mrs. Penethen said. "My name is Penethen."</p>

<p>He bowed, then said: "Hjalmar Johanson."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>"Hjalmar Johanson. Svedish. Wait--I have a card."</p>

<p>He delved into his clothes and produced a very large
pocket-book, then, after searching, a card. She read:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">Hjalmar Johanson,</p>

<p align="CENTER">Gymnastic Instructor,</p>

<p align="CENTER">Certified Professor of Gymnastics,
Stockholm.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Address: Amager Faelledvej II/5,</p>

<p align="CENTER">Kobenhavn.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Kobenhavn?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. Copenhagen. That's what you call it in England. But I'm
a Swede. Half--and half English."</p>

<p>"Half English?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my mother were English."</p>

<p>Having gone so far, accidentally as it were, without intending
it, she felt that she must offer him some food and drink.
Afterwards when, as she so often did, she looked back to the
events of this evening, she wondered at her own actions. Unlike
her to admit a strange man into her house without a question! But
it seemed to her that she was caught by some force stronger than
herself, and before she realised it he had drawn up his chair to
the table and was eating the cold ham and bread and butter and
drinking the beer, talking, laughing, jolly as though he had
known them a hundred years. And had he not? It seemed to her that
in no time at all he was completely familiar to her. She
recognised a dozen little tricks--the foreign accent, the fling
back of the head, the sudden dramatic gesture (this so un-English
and yet so known to her), the smile that had in some way a
touching childish crookedness, the corners of the mouth turning
up so that it was saucer-shaped, clown-like, or rather a child
laughing so eagerly that the whole face must share. Through it
all the clear, steady blue eyes were the most familiar of any.
Her own steady, earnest gaze seemed to be returned to her by his,
so that their eyes held separate converse, gravely, honestly,
apart from the rest of his tale, like two old friends who meet
happily in a crowded inn.</p>

<p>As he talked Judy too was caught, Judy who never thought of a
man. She turned in her chair to look at him, fixing upon him that
same incredulous questioning glance that she had for all
humankind. She said nothing, she did not move; she might have
been a figure painted in pale blue and grey against her dark
chair.</p>

<p>Yes, he was half English, half Swede. His mother was English,
a Glebeshire woman indeed--family Polruan, Annie Polruan.</p>

<p>She had gone out when quite a girl with some English people to
service in Stockholm. There she had met his father. He was a
farmer--not a good man, no. He had been thrown from a horse and
killed when he, the boy, was sixteen. The only child. He had had
to work for his mother then. Had been all sorts of things in
Stockholm, barber's boy, waiter, sold newspapers, door-boy at a
hotel, then because he was tall and strong he had been for some
years an artist's model. He liked that. Oh yes, he loved
pictures--never could see enough of them, would go to Italy one
day, Florence, yes, and Rome. Then an artist had been good to him
and advised him because of his strength to go in for gymnasium,
to be a physical instructor, or a masseur. Yes, there were many
in Stockholm. He had gone through the course in Stockholm, doing
it well. In the middle of it his mother had died. Yes, he had
missed her terribly. It was his first great loneliness. He was so
lonely, although he had many friends, that so soon as he had
finished his course he went to Christiania. He was there for a
year teaching gymnastics and doing a special medical course. Then
he went to Copenhagen. Yes, the capital of Denmark. A very nice
town. He did very well there, teaching exercises, making fat
gentlemen and ladies thin, instructing schools. He made some
money too--quite a bit. He was restless. His great ambition was
to go to England and see where his mother had lived, and
afterwards, perhaps Italy . . . Donatello. . . .</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen asked whether that was a place.</p>

<p>No, it was a man. A sculptor. Who made statues. Not the
greatest, perhaps, but the kindest, the most human, the one to be
loved most. . . .</p>

<p>He pulled himself up. He was talking too long. But now he was
here. In the town that his mother had always spoken of, with the
Cathedral. He would perhaps live here. Make fat ladies thin,
teach the children to be strong--and he had wonderful exercises.
. . . He stopped again. After all, if he were to find a bed in
the town. . . .</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Mrs. Penethen said that after all
she <i>had</i> a spare room. She had been speaking the truth when
she had said that she had no bed. This room she did not let save
to some one who would take it for a period, several months. But
on such a night--and it was late--She was conscious of Judy's
sharp gaze. Yes, she was being impulsive, she who always acted so
cautiously, but this man was honest, she would wager her life on
it. And his boy's face. She <i>could</i> not turn him out into
that rain. She had the room. It would not take five minutes to
make it ready. But some consciousness, perhaps, of her unusual
impetuosity made her voice grim as she said to him:</p>

<p>"You had better come and see it: you may not like it."</p>

<p>She picked up the lamp, raised it and walked ahead of him. He
got up, pulling his big body together.</p>

<p>"It will have to be a bad bed not to be right enough for such
a night," he said, laughing. He went with his bag after her up
the dark stairs, having to bend his head beneath the
door-post.</p>

<p>When they had gone the girl rose from her chair and stood in
the middle of the room, listening. Her stare as she waited, one
hand on her hip, was ironical, and at the same time rather
pathetic, as though she had lost her way, wondered of whom she
should ask her direction, but would have no real belief in the
security of the answer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's Miss Midgeley," she said aloud. But it was not
Miss Midgeley. There were the sounds of a key fitting in the
lock, of the door swinging back, of voices, and then three
persons came into the room, two men and a girl.</p>

<p>The girl was at once the most noticeable, being quite
remarkably beautiful. Her beauty shone through the ugly
waterproof that reached to her heels, and in spite of the common
cart-wheel of a hat burdened with a multitude of cheap pink
roses. She did not know how to dress, that was evident, but at
once with her very entrance into the room she had taken the pins
out of the hat and the hat off her head and was shaking the
shabby roses in front of the fire, and so revealed her beautiful
fair hair, masses of it, piled and crowned on the top of her tiny
head. She was small and slight, perfectly proportioned, and
giving the effect of being for ever "on tiptoe for a flight," as
though at any moment she might be discovered to have wings and
float out into the air, vanishing, a speck of white and gold,
into the blue sky. As she turned from the fire to speak to her
companions it could be seen that she was happy, excited, pleased.
Her ulster had been thrown off and she stood there in her rather
common pink dress, her bosom heaving, her eyes dancing, her feet
still moving to some enchanting strain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Judy, it was heaven!" she cried. "You should have been
there!"</p>

<p>The two men were watching her each in his own way. The one was
a big man, fat and fleshy, his face naturally red, turning in the
veins around the nose to purple, the eyes small, the eyebrows so
lightly marked as scarcely to be seen. He was jauntily dressed in
a suit of light grey, and he wore a purple tie with a big
horse-shoe pin. He had fat hands with short stumpy fingers. His
air was genial but, for some reason to-night, a little
uneasy--his age anything between fifty-five and sixty. His
clothes fitted his stout limbs too tightly, just as the flower in
his coat and the pin in his tie were too large. His companion was
a pale, rather ascetic man, with a gentle smile and a courteous
manner; nearly obsequious, he nevertheless gave the impression
that he had his own private power. His name was Reuben Fletch. He
wore a black tie and a neat pair of black shoes.</p>

<p>He was of a well-known Polchester family, had been born and
bred in Polchester and had lived there all his life. He had
lodged now at Mrs. Penethen's for a number of years, was a
solicitor by profession and a miser above all. He was said to be
extremely able, to know neither conscience nor morals, and to
have much power over important individuals in our town. He was
forty-five years of age and unmarried.</p>

<p>The two men looked at the girl, the eyes of the stout man
narrowing until they had almost vanished, and a very faint smile
hovering about his lips. Fletch stared, his face immobile.</p>

<p>The girls as they stood together offered an interesting
contrast. It was plain that they were sisters, and that they were
Mrs. Penethen's daughters; they had, both of them, something of
her refinement in the sharp-pointed noses, the delicate ears and
the white shapely necks; but all the life and colour seemed to
have been stolen by the one girl from the other--stolen because
Maude, the elder, had the air of a victorious captor, and in her
lovely shining hair, her gleaming eyes, the soft colour of her
cheeks, the grace and movement of her body, she seemed to
proclaim her contempt for, her superiority over, the thin little
lustreless girl at her side. Lustreless was what poor Judy was,
her complexion pale, her mouth frowning, her whole body uneasy
and awkward in its pose. A plain girl, even were Maude not
there--plainer by far in contrast and from the power of some
secret resentment and anger that she was feeling.</p>

<p>Maude turned round to the men. "Make yourself comfortable, Mr.
Hogg, do. You know my sister Judy? . . . Where's mother?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs," Judy said, staring at the two men as though she
hated them.</p>

<p>"She's not gone to bed? I want my cocoa. You know where the
whisky is, Mr. Fletch. I'm sure Mr. Hogg would like a glass."</p>

<p>"Mother will be down in a moment," Judy said. "She's showing a
new lodger his room."</p>

<p>"A new lodger!" Maude cried. "At this time of night!--And
mother said she wasn't going to let the red room anyway. As
though we hadn't enough with Miss Midgeley as it is--"</p>

<p>"I know. She didn't mean to let it. But he came in out of the
rain, and mother took a fancy to him. He's a foreigner--"</p>

<p>"A foreigner!"</p>

<p>"Yes. A Norwegian or Swede or something. And he's about eight
feet tall."</p>

<p>Judy threw all this out scornfully as though she had contempt
for them all but wished to see what effect this news would have
upon them.</p>

<p>Not very much apparently. The two men were seated at the table
helping themselves to the whisky, and Maude broke out:</p>

<p>"Oh well, bother it all anyway. I want my cocoa. It was a
<i>lovely</i> dance, wasn't it, Mr. Hogg? Didn't you <i>love</i>
every minute of it?"</p>

<p>She danced a few steps and then stopped abruptly as the door
opened and her mother came in, followed by the stranger.</p>

<p>It was strange to observe the effect that at once he made upon
all of them. Perhaps Judy alone of all that group observed it.
His height had something to do with the challenge that he always
presented to any company that he confronted, but it was not only
his height. No one, save possibly Miss Midgeley, quite defined it
during all that time that he was in Polchester. Mrs. Penethen had
<i>her</i> version, Mary Longstaffe had <i>hers</i>, Fletch
certainly had his, Ronder his, Cole his--all of them different.
Why, to this very moment, so many years afterwards, when it is
all a legend, his arrival, his deeds, the after effects, that
exact impression of his personality is still hotly debated. "All
I know is," Mrs. Penethen herself used to say (she died in 1917),
"you couldn't be the same as you were before he came in, none of
you. You fell in love with him at once or you couldn't bear him.
And I fell in love with him. Yes, that very first wet night when
he was sitting at my table eating my bread and ham.</p>

<p>"'I've got a room,' I said, just as though it were some one
else speaking the words behind me, for I assure you I had had no
more intention of letting that room that night than I had of
sailing through the ceiling on wings. But there it was, from the
first I couldn't resist him!"</p>

<p>On this present occasion Mrs. Penethen saw the new arrivals
and said shortly, "Oh, so you've got back. Why, Mr. Hogg, good
evening!" He got up and she shook hands with him, not overpleased
at his presence it seemed. "Pray make yourself at home" (here
just a touch of irony perhaps). "Oh, let me introduce. This is
Mr. Johnson from Copenhagen. My daughter Maude, Mr. Johnson. Mr.
Fletch, Mr. Hogg. Have a drop of whisky, Mr. Johnson, I'm sure
you need it." Johanson shook hands with every one, clicking his
heels and bending from the waist. That little habit may seem
unimportant in itself, but it had its later seriousness, as it
led certain people in our town to speak of him as "that German"
at a time when Germans were not very popular with us because of
Hoffmann's proposed Town Hall.</p>

<p>He sat down very comfortably at the table next to Samuel Hogg,
and was very soon telling that gentleman all about himself, his
mother and father, Stockholm and Copenhagen, his hopes and his
ambitions, it being always his simple way to believe that every
one must be interested in hearing about himself just as he was
interested in everything that they had to tell <i>him.</i> And
Hogg sat with a smile, drinking his whisky.</p>

<p>From the first moment, however, eagerly though he talked,
Johanson was conscious of Maude Penethen. He could not but be
conscious of her with her wonderful hair, her perpetual movement
about the room, her cries and laughter, her little coquetries and
brazenries. And she also was conscious of him.</p>

<p>"Mother, I want my cocoa. Never mind the men, mother, they can
look after themselves. Ladies first. Oh, mother, it was heavenly.
I danced <i>every</i> dance. Such a shame it had to be over so
early. Lady St. Leath looked in for a moment, mother. Yes, she
did. She spoke to Miss Cardigan and asked how the Club was
getting on. She made us a little speech and said how glad she was
we were all enjoying ourselves. Oh, she looked all right, but a
little <i>dowdy,</i> you know, like she always is. She doesn't
know how to dress a bit, and they say her husband would give her
anything she'd ask for. Oh yes, and Canon Ronder came, just for
ten minutes, and danced with Miss Cardigan. Oh, mother, you
<i>would</i> have laughed! He's like a tub and she's so skinny.
He spoke to me, too, and asked how you were. And I was much the
prettiest girl there. I'm sure I was. Wasn't I, Mr. Hogg?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you were, Miss Penethen," he answered, smiling at
her.</p>

<p>"Well, you shouldn't say so even though you thought it, and
you shouldn't think it even though you were it," said her mother.
"It's not for you to say."</p>

<p>Maude laughed, drinking her cocoa, balancing on the edge of
her chair and stealing glances at Johanson. Suddenly he looked
directly at her. Their eyes met. She sprang up from her chair and
danced about, flinging her arms around her mother, then rushing
at Judy and kissing her, then pausing near Mr. Fletch.</p>

<p>"You never danced with me once," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her full with his round black eyes. "You never
asked me," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I did! I'm sure I did! Hundreds of times. Never mind!
There's another on Tuesday--"</p>

<p>Samuel Hogg got up. "I must be going, Mrs. Penethen. It's
late. Thank you for your hospitality."</p>

<p>She did not try to prevent him, but said good night to him
gravely. Maude saw him to the door, and there was some giggling
and laughter, some low-voiced words before the outer door
closed.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's bed-time for everybody," said Mrs.
Penethen.</p>

<p>But even then the evening was not concluded. The farther door
opened, and a little woman with a wrinkled face looked in:</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, but could I have another candle, Mrs.
Penethen? Mine's about done."</p>

<p>She stepped into the kitchen. Her face was a map of wrinkles,
she wore a red woollen jacket and a grey skirt. She was just like
a robin. Johanson happened to be near the door. She looked up and
saw him.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she cried.</p>

<p>Maude burst into laughter. "Oh, I can't help it. . . . I beg
your pardon. . . . But the difference in height. . . . Oh dear. .
. . Mr. Johnson so tall and Miss Midgeley--!"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> amusing! Mrs. Penethen herself smiled as she
laid:</p>

<p>"Miss Midgeley, this is Mr. Johnson. He has taken a room
here."</p>

<p>She looked up at him whimsically. "It will never do for us to
go about together," she said drily. "The whole town will
laugh."</p>

<p>He smiled. "They was always saying when I were a boy that I'd
be a giant. I were as big when I were fourteen as I am now. There
are plenty taller than me in Denmark."</p>

<p>No one had anything to say to this, so they all prepared to go
to bed. Only Maude at the last, as he stood aside for her to
pass, said, smiling up at him:</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Johnson. I do hope the bed will be long
enough!"</p>

<h1><a name="c102">CHAPTER II</a></h1>

<h1>THE REVEREND TOM AT HOME AND ABROAD</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The steepest street in our town, and one of the steepest in
Southern England, is Orange Street, and nearly at the top of
Orange Street, just below the Monument, is St. Paul's Church. The
Rector of St. Paul's at this time was the Reverend Thomas
Longstaffe. He had been Rector of St. Paul's for ten years now,
coming to Polchester in 1897, Jubilee Year, the very week that
Archdeacon Brandon died so tragically.</p>

<p>He was a widower, about fifty years old when he arrived, and
with him a daughter of eighteen, Mary, a very pretty girl, the
adored of his heart, his only child.</p>

<p>When he had been four years in Polchester a terribly tragic
thing occurred. Mary Longstaffe was a very bright, clever girl,
modern in her ideas, knowing many things that were entirely
beyond the average Polchester young lady of that time. She even
talked of going up to Oxford, which was thought very daring of
her by Mrs. Sampson, Mrs. Preston and other ladies in the
Precincts. The Precincts ladies in fact did not like her, called
her fast, and did not invite her to their houses. In any case,
the Cathedral set always kept to itself in our town, and Tom
Longstaffe, being only Rector of St. Paul's and not even a Minor
Canon, would be, of course, outside it. A certain Major Waring, a
retired Indian officer, lived in our town and had an only son who
was at Oxford. Lance Waring fell violently in love with Mary
Longstaffe, and throughout one summer they were always together,
riding, playing tennis, walking, and dancing. Early in the
September of that year he was thrown from his horse and killed.
In October it was known that Mary Longstaffe was going to have a
baby, and that Lance Waring was its father.</p>

<p>What horrified every one so terribly was that she stayed
calmly on in our town for several months after this was known.
She seemed to have no shame at all, and walked up and down the
High Street and took her usual seat in the Cathedral just as
though she were like every one else. Of course every one cut her,
every one except old Mrs. Combermere, who was eccentric and just
did things to show her eccentricity, and young Lady St. Leath,
whose brother had married the daughter of Samuel Hogg the
publican, once owner of a low public-house down in Seatown, who
was "queer," therefore, in any case, and the perpetual sorrow and
cross of the old Dowager's life.</p>

<p>Mary Longstaffe had stayed in Polchester until Christmas of
that year, and after that she vanished. It was rumoured vaguely
from time to time that she lived in London, that she had a son,
that she lived by writing for the newspapers; in any case she was
not seen again in Polchester.</p>

<p>On the whole there had been considerable sympathy felt for
poor Tom Longstaffe. He had always been a popular man: she was
his only child, and he must be very lonely now without her. It
all came of the girl having no mother and picking up all these
advanced ideas. It was as likely as not that she had become one
of these Suffragettes about whom now in London every one was
talking.</p>

<p>Yes, the Reverend Tom was lonely, very lonely indeed. He was
now, in 1907, sixty years of age, and for the five last years he
had lived quite alone save for an old family servant. He was a
short, thick-set man with a face red-brown, the colour of a
pippin apple, grey hair, and a good strong chin. He was a man who
adored sport of every kind and was never indoors when he could be
out of it. This was the man known to most of the Polcastrians, a
jolly, red-faced, kind-hearted sportsman with not too much of the
parson about him.</p>

<p>Within this man there was another, a man deeply religious and
passionately affectionate. He was never much of a reader, his
sermons were so simple as to be called by many people childish,
and he never spoke of his religion unless it were his duty to do
so; it was, nevertheless, at the root of his whole life.</p>

<p>He was also, outwardly, nothing of a
sentimentalist--nevertheless he had had in earlier years two
friendships, and afterwards his love for his wife and his
daughter, and these few relationships had been passionate in
their hidden intensity. Of his two friends one had died and the
other had married; his wife had endured two years of agony from
cancer before her death; his daughter's tragedy was common
knowledge to every one. What he had suffered through these things
no one save his daughter knew--nevertheless here he was, the
cheeriest and merriest clergyman in Polchester.</p>

<p>The Rectory was a square grey-roofed building standing back
from Orange Street and having a lawn and two old trees in front
of it. To the left of it and almost touching it was the church,
and to the right of it Hay Street, where was the famous
Polchester High School for Girls.</p>

<p>It was a jolly old Rectory with solid, square rooms, plenty of
space and light, and a fine view over Polchester from the attic
windows.</p>

<p>On a certain day in January 1907 Tom Longstaffe suffered from
an agonising temptation, and alone in his study on that grey
January morning he wrestled with this temptation, knowing in his
heart that he would be beaten by it.</p>

<p>He had that morning found on his breakfast table the following
letter from his daughter:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>11 Gower Street, London, W.C.,</p>

<p><i>January</i> 3, 1907.</p>

<p>DARLING FATHER--I am coming home. Podge and I can endure being
away from you no longer. I think I could have held out a while
more but for your last letter, which, for all its pretended
cheeriness, gave the whole show away. If you miss me so much and
I miss you so much, aren't we sillies, when life is so short, to
keep away from one another? And all for what? All for a lot of
chattering old women about whose opinion we neither of us care a
scrap. More serious than that is the one that if I come back to
live with you I may damage your congregation. They may stay away
because of me. Well, if they do I can but go away again. But why
should they? It isn't as though they didn't know all about it and
haven't known for the last five years. And it isn't as though I
were going to make myself prominent in any way. They'll never see
either Podge or myself if they don't want to. You shall give them
their tea and listen to their outpourings just as you have always
done. I shan't expect to be asked to any of their houses, and you
must go to them just as you have always done. I shall make that
quite plain as soon as I arrive. They'll be used to me in no
time, and only pity you and love you the more because you have
such a heavy burden to bear! (Isn't that the phrase?) And
meanwhile, oh <i>meanwhile,</i> darling Daddy, we shall have one
another! Just think of that! Morning, noon and night we shall be
together and shall be wondering all the time what we have been
doing to have wasted five precious years of our lives away from
one another!</p>

<p>It is true that I have Podge, and that he is everything a
mother can want in a son, but he isn't you--and I need you both.
I do indeed. And so it shall be.</p>

<p>As to finances, we shall manage quite well. I'm becoming quite
an authority on Housing questions, the Way the Poor Live (or
Don't Live), Women's Suffrage and anything else you like. My
articles are the astonishment of economic London!</p>

<p>After all this you will expect to see your daughter with ink
(instead of vine-leaves) in her hair and holes in her cotton
frocks. Wait! Only you wait! And you shan't wait very long
either. Whether you like it or no, I am coming--so Prepare! Your
always loving</p>

<p align="RIGHT">MARY.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>This was the letter that caused him to pace up and down his
study, his head a little forward, his hands closed behind his
back, his short, rather stumpy body being moved forward in jerks
as though by the action of some secret spring within him. As he
moved, all his past life seemed to swing around him, up and down
through the bare study, bare save for his untidy table with its
crucifix, its piles of letters and papers, his arm-chair, a worn
sofa--bare and grey in the ugly January light.</p>

<p>All his life, which seemed to him now in retrospect to have
consisted only of one brief moment, had been engaged in this same
war between his affections and his duty. There had been that
first friendship made by him at Oxford--and he saw instantly a
succession of pictures of English summers and bathes and
cricket-matches and long walks in dusky evenings, an Italian
holiday, a trip to Egypt--and how surprised they had both been by
the emotion that after a while rushed in and filled their hearts,
and how he, with his English public-school training, had been
afraid of sentiment and feeling and had felt that his love for
his friend was stepping in front of his love for God, and how he
had gradually withdrawn . . . and his friend had married and that
had been the end. Then came his meeting with the woman whom he
married, his passionate adoration of her, her quieter affection
for him, some aloofness that she had, something that he never
quite touched. And then in the very middle of this, when his
married life and his religious life seemed so utterly to absorb
him body and soul, the sudden upspringing of that strange
friendship with Charles Upcott, a man of over forty, learned, a
scholar, grave, an indoor man, nothing in common--and yet this
sudden friendship that flamed up in a day and burnt with a steady
fire until Upcott's death, a year after their first meeting, from
pleurisy. Christina, his wife, had seemed to understand this
friendship and fostered it in every way. She said that it was
what he needed, smiling at him in that quiet, strange, aloof way
that removed her sometimes so far from him. . . .</p>

<p>Here, too, he had doubted and felt that he was in the wrong.
It was not only the emotional quality, felt both by Upcott and
himself, that his training told him was weak and sentimental
between men (although his soul told him that it was not), it was
also that Upcott was a declared and convinced atheist, gentle
towards Longstaffe's beliefs because he loved him, but showing
with every word and movement that he held them to be childish and
incredible. So once again Longstaffe's heart was in the way of
his duty, but the matter was abruptly settled for him by Upcott's
sudden death.</p>

<p>He recalled now as he paced his study the grief and agony that
that death had meant to him. Had he before or afterwards known
such pain and loneliness? No, he must confess to himself that
even his wife's death had not afflicted himself so intolerably.
There had never been a day, perhaps, when he had not thought of
Upcott, seeing his hatchet-jawed face, his dreaming student's
eyes, his long shambling body, heard the echo of his little
stammer, felt the warm touch of his hand. . . .</p>

<p>And then he passed to his wife's agony and death--her
patience, her courage, her wonderful, wonderful courage! He could
see her lying, her eyes lost in distance, assuring him that she
was not in any pain, asking him about the trivial things of the
day. . . . Christina! Christina! Christina! He said that name
aloud as though by the whisper of it he might bring her for a
moment back to him. But in vain, in vain, as it had always been
in vain. She had always eluded him, loving him as a traveller
loves a town in which he likes to stay for a moment before
passing on--her eyes had been fixed on other destinies.</p>

<p>And so there had been left to him only Mary. Mary had been
everything to him, mother, daughter, brother, sister, friend.
From the very first, long before she could speak, she had seemed
to understand him exactly. They had been such companions as never
were! He had taught her to run, to swim, to bowl quite a decent
fast ball, to ride, to shoot. She had been clever, too, far
cleverer than he had ever been, and was soon reading books that
were far beyond him. He had sent her to a splendid school for
girls in the Midlands; the wrench of her departures had been
terrible, but then their meetings, the holidays, the fun, the
walks, the games, the companionship.</p>

<p>And then--the awful tragedy. Just as she was growing into
perfect womanhood. Once again his heart had confronted his duty.
He learnt in one fierce, blinding flash that did you love enough
nothing mattered--God Himself must turn and bow His head before
human love at its most intense. He fought for her like a tiger,
he would have gone with her to the end of the world. She would
not have it, seeing truly that his Polchester work was the only
thing to keep him sane.</p>

<p>His love of God saved him. In his faith there were no
complexities, no doubts, no fears. God was there and loved His
children. God was sorry for Mary's sin, but had forgiven her and
was caring for her. Again and again he felt that he must leave
Polchester and go to her; he did, of course, go up to London and
visit her whenever it was possible, but the loneliness as the
years passed grew harder and harder to bear. And yet he knew that
he must not leave Polchester. His duty was there, the only work
that his older years were likely to have for him. Oh! how he
longed to have her back! How every room in the house called for
her; how old Hephzibah, who had nursed her from her birth, longed
for her; how at night he would rise from his bed and pace his
room fighting his desire to ask her to return.</p>

<p>And yet he must not. He could not ask her to face the
ostracism and social banning that there would be. He did not
know, too, how he himself could endure it, what his own anger
might not be. Her name was never mentioned by any one in
Polchester save by Mrs. Combermere, a rather eccentric widow who
lived with her dogs in an old house in the Precincts, but outside
the Precincts life and social code. She seemed to be Mary's only
friend. And yet it might not be so. When they saw Mary and
realised her sweetness and goodness they would surely forgive
that earlier fault. How could they help it? he said, looking up
at her photograph on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>And at that look he yielded. She shall come back. For a little
while at any rate. At the very thought of having her again in
that house his heart leapt with joy and his eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>He sat down at the table and then again paused. There was
another side to her return, a side involving wider and more
public issues.</p>

<p>I have said already that the Rector of St. Paul's, unless he
were a man of very exceptional talent and intellect, would be by
necessity outside the Cathedral politics.</p>

<p>Tom Longstaffe was neither in talent nor intellect an
exceptional man, and during all his ten years in Polchester he
had never on one occasion been asked to dine with the Dean, nor
had any of the Cathedral ladies called on his daughter after
their arrival. Old Bishop Purcell had indeed invited him to
luncheon at Carpledon and he had gone and had spent a most happy
afternoon, but within six months Bishop Purcell was dead and
Bishop Franklin reigned in his stead. Bishop Franklin had not the
personality of his predecessor, who was a saint of God if ever
one walked this sinful earth. Bishop Franklin was a good man, but
not too good, and his thoughts were for ever with the Kings of
Israel, whose slightest habits and most abstruse customs were
more real to him than were his wife (an invalid) and two
dried-up, pigeon-breasted daughters.</p>

<p>As to the Archdeacons, Witheram was growing an old man now and
was nearly always out of Polchester busied with visitations
throughout Glebeshire; the other Archdeacon, Brodribb, who had
succeeded Brandon in '97, was a man without any colour of
personality, agreeable, negligible, interested in Shakespeare
Texts and Elizabethan dramatists, a man who did his duty, was
easily influenced, and was something of a hypochondriac.</p>

<p>No, it was not these men who directed the Cathedral politics
of our town. These were directed by two others, one the Rev.
Ambrose Wistons, Vicar of the church of Pybus St. Anthony, a
village a few miles out of Polchester, one the Rev. Frederick
Ronder, Canon of the Cathedral. It may seem strange that some of
the Cathedral policy should have been directed from a small
village outside our town, but this was not the first occasion on
which Pybus St. Anthony had played an important part in the
affairs of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>It had been the custom for a number of years past that the
Vicar of Pybus St. Anthony should be a man of mark, and promotion
to positions of great importance had often arisen out of that
humble appointment. Ambrose Wistons had been asked to come to
Pybus with the quite definite understanding that he would play a
large part in the Cathedral's affairs, the larger perhaps because
he was not actually one of the Cathedral staff.</p>

<p>Wistons had been at Pybus now for ten years, and he had made
his personality felt throughout the whole of Southern England. He
had on several occasions refused advancement; he was a man who
kept his counsel, had few intimate friends, and was feared as
much as he was loved. Himself was fearless, as every one knew,
and was utterly single-minded.</p>

<p>He was perhaps the greatest preacher in the whole of England
at that time, and Polcastrians crowded his village church on
Sunday evenings. On the three or four occasions during the year
when he preached in the Cathedral, the Cathedral nave was packed.
People went perhaps as much for sensation as for eloquence. He
seemed to love to shock the orthodox; he was a modern of the
moderns, as his books showed, and to simple minds like Tom
Longstaffe's many of his utterances were treason.</p>

<p>"He seems to hate the Cathedral," Tom Longstaffe said, pacing
his study. "He would pull it down if he could. He says that it
stands in the way of Christ. And yet there are times when he
seems to hate Christ too, or at least His Divinity. Surely we are
not meant to destroy the Bible utterly, as Wistons would have us
do. He is a terrible danger here!" And yet the man's courage drew
him and attracted him as nothing else in Polchester did. But
Wistons never noticed him, although they had met at many
ecclesiastical gatherings. Wistons never did more than nod to him
sternly. He never stopped to speak to him as did Ryle, or
Bentinck-Major, or Martin. He did not want, it seemed, to know
him. He went with his dry, wizened, almost sarcastic, spare face
up and down the city intent on his own affairs, wanting nothing
for himself, not even the love and affection of his
fellow-men.</p>

<p>Very different was this other, Canon Ronder. Ronder was now a
man of some fifty years of age, fat like a tub, with a red, jolly
face, smart and even elegant in appearance (a difficult thing for
a stout clergyman to be), and living with an elderly aunt in a
comfortable house in the Precincts. Ronder was certainly at this
time in 1907 the most important man in Polchester. There was no
pie whatever, lay or ecclesiastical, in which he had not some
finger.</p>

<p>"He is surely," said Longstaffe to himself, "the most popular
human being in Polchester, and quite naturally so. He is
hail-fellow with every one. He brings the Cathedral really into
contact with the town, and you will see Shandon the Mayor and
Sharpe the Town-clerk as often there as Bentinck-Major or
Brodribb--more often perhaps. Every one must like him--he is so
genial and kindly and remembers every one, and is ready to listen
to anybody's story."</p>

<p>And yet every one did not like him. Although no open breach
had come it was quite certain that the town was divided into two
parties, the Wistons party and the Ronder party, and the Wistons
party did not hesitate to say terrible things about Ronder--that
he was false, money-grabbing, sycophantic, would sell his mother,
if he had one, to increase his personal comfort. On the other
hand, the Ronder party said that Wistons was an atheist, a
socialist, propagator of immoral opinions, a scientist before he
was a Christian, an iconoclast, and so on.</p>

<p>The Ronder party were all for the development of the town.
They wanted a better railway station, a new town hall, a golf
links, a racecourse, a theatre, two more hotels--heaven knows
what! Their argument was that our town with its Cathedral should
be the most important in Glebeshire, that it <i>could</i> be if
only the Polcastrians would wake up and realise that we were in a
new world now, the Victorian era was, thank God, over and the
Boer War had shaken us all up.</p>

<p>And the Wistons party retorted that we were forgetting God
altogether, that the Cathedral was becoming a temple of Mammon,
that the very Canons were concerned in shady money transactions
that no honest man would touch, that officials in the position of
Ronder and Bentinck-Major ought not even to know such men as
Samuel Hogg and Jim Curtis.</p>

<p>To which the Ronder party retorted that the clergymen of the
town ought to know every one, that the fortunes of the town and
the Cathedral were intimately connected, that the Cathedral was
badly in need of funds, that restoration of one of the Towers was
necessary, that there were many other things to be done, that it
was all very well to have fine ideas about the Four Gospels and
be a professor of the very latest Higher Criticism, but where was
Higher Criticism if one of the Western Towers fell down?</p>

<p>And so on. And so on.</p>

<p>Of all this Tom Longstaffe had been, until the last two
months, only a spectator. Then suddenly, only a month or so ago,
Miss Ronder had asked him to dinner, and he had found there the
old Dean and his wife, the Bentinck-Majors and the Ryles--all the
Cathedral set. Shortly after that Ronder had called upon him
about tea-time, had been very jolly, had played on his piano, had
admired a little bronze that he had picked up once in Rome, and
had finally said that they did not see enough of one another, and
that they must all pull together now for the good of the town and
the Cathedral. This surprising visit had been followed by an
invitation to dine at Bentinck-Major's (every one knew that
Bentinck-Major was a tool of Ronder), and then, most amazing of
all, he had received an invitation to join the Shakespeare
Reading Society, that society that had for its members only the
most exclusive part of the Cathedral set.</p>

<p>The Cathedral had just discovered Tom Longstaffe--that was
clear: or at any rate that section of Cathedral society that
claimed Ronder for its leader. It would be idle to pretend that
Longstaffe was not pleased. He had had a very lonely five years;
he wished, as do most of us, to be liked by his fellows; above
all, he adored the Cathedral. He had always felt that he was kept
away from the Cathedral, not so much by a set of social snobs as
rather by some force in the Cathedral itself. He had seen no way
by which he might come closer to it. There was, it is true, a
third party in the town who would have welcomed him to its arms,
the party headed years ago triumphantly by old Archdeacon
Brandon, the old-fashioned party who wanted everything to be as
it always had been, who hated any change whether in town or
Cathedral; but that party was dying, if it were not already dead,
and consisted only of a few old men and women who may have had
some rightful place in the world before the Boer War, but
certainly had none anywhere now.</p>

<p>No, Tom Longstaffe was touched and pleased. He would rather,
it is true, that it had been Wistons who had made some advance to
him. He was not sure of Ronder, there was something about the man
that he did not trust. . . . Nevertheless . . .</p>

<p>He at once accepted the invitation to join the Shakespeare
Reading Society and received by return the notice that on January
18 the play of <i>Hamlet</i> would be read at the Precentor's
house at 8.15 sharp, and that he had been cast for the part of
Guildenstern.</p>

<p>And if Mary returned? Well, good-bye to the Cathedral set. Not
that it mattered. For himself he did not care at all, and if he
had Mary with him the whole world might cut him dead for all that
he minded. But if God intended him to play a greater part in the
town, to take more share in the Cathedral's affairs? Well, if God
intended that, He certainly also intended that he should love his
own dear daughter--and, at the thought of her, at the mere
glimpse of her smiling down at him from the mantelpiece, he sat
at his table once again and wrote to her saying that she was
right, that he could not bear to be apart from her any longer,
that she must come as soon as possible. . . .</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon of that dank day the mists came up from
the Pol and wreathed themselves about the town. Longstaffe lit
the gas in his study soon after he had finished his solitary
luncheon and sat down and tried to work. He had much to do, and
had not intended to go outside the house that day. But the
thoughts needed for the prefatory letter to next month's parish
magazine would not come. This was never in any case an easy task
for him; he certainly had not, of all men, the pen of a ready
writer; and to-day the face of his daughter slipped in between
himself and the paper and danced bewitchingly before him. And
something else too. He did not know, he could not say. Perhaps he
was not well. In any case, this fog disturbed him, filling the
room with a strange brown, smoky light, and if he looked across
at the window the bare-armed trees beyond were hidden and then
revealed, suddenly peering in at him like skinny witches.</p>

<p>It was as though the whole world were smouldering in a cold,
billowy, smoky fire, and then, as though at the word of a
mysterious command beyond the window, it cleared and there was a
cold blue sky and the limbs of the trees were stark grey; only in
his room the brown mist still smouldered.</p>

<p>He would go out. He had done enough for to-day--enough, that
is nothing, only that letter to his daughter which as he posted
it in the Orange Street letter-box surely changed his life for
him.</p>

<p>He went slowly up the High Street through a ghostly town in
which doors closed, bells rang, voices murmured, walls slid
forward and back again, colours in windows flamed and were
veiled, houses leapt from the mist like centaurs and plunged then
into a lake of grey.</p>

<p>Almost at one time he thought he had lost his way, and then
the Arden Gate was before him and the Cathedral hung like a
gigantic ship sailing through opalescent mist. Near to the Arden
Gate, on the very edge of the Cathedral Green, a man was
standing. Longstaffe ran into him, apologised, stopped and looked
up. The man was like a statue, and, in that mist, gigantic. A
hand was laid on Longstaffe's shoulder and a voice, kindly,
foreign, said, "My carelessness. But it is difficult in this
mist. I have heard of your terrible English fogs, and now I see
one. Could you tell me kindly if one may go into the Cathedral at
this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Longstaffe, "certainly. Evensong is at half-past
three. You have nearly an hour before that."</p>

<p>"My heartliest thanks."</p>

<p>Something kept Longstaffe there. "You are a stranger? Can I
help you in any way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have been in your town two weeks and into your
Cathedral every day. But there are hours--once they wouldn't let
me go in and another time I must leave before I wished!"</p>

<p>It came into Longstaffe's mind then that he had heard
something; some one had told him about a Scandinavian, a Dane or
a Swede, who had come to the town, and intended to start a
gymnasium or something of the sort. This might be he.</p>

<p>He liked the man's kindly face, and something husky and
boy-like in the voice. But it was not his business. "Nobody will
disturb you in the Cathedral for at least an hour," he said. "It
will be too dark for you to see much, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," the stranger bowed. "My heartliest
thanks."</p>

<p>But he did not move, and stood beaming down at Longstaffe as
though he expected him to speak.</p>

<p>"Are you staying long in Polchester?" Longstaffe asked,
feeling foolish.</p>

<p>"For a long time as I hope. I am half English, you know. My
mother was from this county." He felt in his pocket and produced
a card. "I am intending to start some gymnasia here. There are
none in your town. I like this town. I like your people. I have
already many friends. I am very happy here."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it," said Longstaffe. "It's a very
good idea, a gymnasium. Just what we want."</p>

<p>"Ah, you think so. I am so glad. I think so. Mrs. Penethen
think so and her daughters, and Miss Midgeley and all my friends.
I have some money that I have saved, and I have seen two rooms
that is very cheap, and an old sailor who will help, and his son
who is very strong. Exercises is very good for everybody--for the
muscles, for the heart, for the brain. It clears up everything
and makes every one happy."</p>

<p>This was a subject close to Longstaffe's heart. "You are
right, Mr.--Mr.--" he consulted the card--"Mr. Johanson. I wish
you very good fortune." He found a card of his own. "If I can be
of any help to you--" His hand was gripped.</p>

<p>"Very kind indeed. My heartliest thanks." The man bowed and
strode off into the mist.</p>

<p>Longstaffe stood there for a moment, then turned up the
Precincts.</p>

<h1><a name="c103">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<h1>FROM GABRIELLE MIDGELEY'S DIARY--I</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p><i>FEB.</i> 7, 11.30 <i>P.M.</i>--. . . which isn't what I
meant to say to her in the least, but she aggravates me so
intensely sometimes that I say what I don't mean at all. The
truth is that, unless I'm very careful, I shall be in another
year or two nothing but a cross, sour old woman. It was because
of my fear of this, I suppose, that I stopped this Diary six
months back. What's the use of recording the thoughts, fears,
likes and dislikes of a bad-tempered old maid whom nobody wants
and who, thank God, herself wants nobody. I meant never to open
this shabby old book again. But I have a new reason--not a bad
one either. At any rate it isn't myself this time.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that I'm getting back some of the hot
temper and nasty liveliness of fifteen years ago. Who ever would
have supposed it? Fifteen years' superb indifference and now
suddenly I want to wring Maude's beautiful neck until her head's
round the other way! And the difference isn't in Maude. She's
always been a pig. The difference is myself. Yes, and in Ma
Penethen and in Judy. All of us widows or virgins. Us women--and
all because there's a man in the house.</p>

<p>Not altogether that either. Our dear friend Reuben with his
yellow poll has been with us for years, and we weren't excited.
But this new man is something special. It's certainly because of
him that I've opened this book again. There is to be in these
pages as little of myself as I can manage. One creeps in all the
same, of course, but I have some of my old novel-writing instinct
back again. After the schoolgirl's pap that I've been serving out
for the last ten years--what a relief! Perhaps--who knows--some
of my poor lost talent will come whistling back, the talent that
Ruff once said was going to burn the Thames dry! Poor Ruff, if he
could only see me now!</p>

<p>The house is so quiet that it isn't difficult to bring those
years back again. I haven't thought of them for ages. Haven't I?
No, I truly have not. But this man brings them back whether I
will or no. There is something in common between us there. The
belief in things that I had then--the belief that he has now.
That belief that he has irritates me, of course. When he was
talking to me the other night I turned on him like a savage. I
told him that he might as well know once for all that I hated
sentimentality above all things. All this talk about changing the
world! As though you could ever change anybody! And he just
smiled and said that that was the last thing that he wanted to
do, that he didn't want to change anything or anybody. He just
had his ideas, and if two or three other people thought as he did
it would be nice to try a few things. I told him that he was
deceived in people, they weren't as nice as he thought them, or
loyal or true or anything--they were all rotten somewhere, and
that one only made a fool of oneself by believing in people.</p>

<p>He laughed and said that he was sure he'd met more rotten
people than I had, but he'd found most of them good
somewhere--all this with his funny accent and his singulars and
plurals and pronouns all wrong, and his large blue eyes that are
like a baby's or a hero of one of Crockett's novels. I said he
was romantic and idealistic and sentimental, all things that I
loathed, and that we'd never get on. And then he laughed and I
laughed, and Maude came in and was angry at his wasting his time
even with an old woman like me covered with wrinkles, and I liked
that. I'd do anything to spite Maude.</p>

<p>Then there's no doubt that he's kind and polite--both things
that I like and see little enough of here. He asked me whether
there had never been a time when I'd believed in things? and I
said yes, there had been. And I saw myself that day Harland took
my first story for <i>The Yellow Book,</i> and asked me to go and
see him, and how rosy the world looked, and what a darling
Harland was, and how I loved every one! And the night Ruff told
me he loved me, that night at Chris's party when Oscar Wilde
came, and Ada Leverson was there, and Max, and I seemed to be
sitting with my hand on the very wheel that turned the world
round! And that first month that I had with Ruff when we went up
to that little inn by Ullswater, the nights and the days! . . .
Yes, yes, there <i>was</i> a time when I too believed!</p>

<p>As I sit here the rain has begun, the only sound save for the
clock on the stairs in all the world, and although it's pattering
on my window-pane, it's from behind my Cathedral wall that it
seems to come. As always! Everything comes from inside the
Cathedral, the carts, the horses, the errand-boys, the bicycles,
the old ladies--a whole ghostly world--so that as I sit here for
so many long hours together in this room I have grown to imagine
that building peopled with ghosts--all the trade and traffic of a
ghostly hemisphere.</p>

<p>And now to-night the rain is the ghostliest of the lot,
footstep after footstep pattering down that long dark nave,
figures grey and shadowy staring from behind every tomb and from
under every brass. For years I have been sitting here thinking
that my life was over, and now suddenly the stream seems to be
trickling down from the hills again, the dry bed beginning to be
moistened. The very energy of that man downstairs seems to have
touched me, laugh at him though I may.</p>

<p><i>Feb.</i> 15.--Our friend the Swede is getting on. He is
making acquaintances everywhere. People take to him, which is
strange enough in a conservative little place like this where the
very word "foreigner" frightens every one. He has started his
gymnasium or whatever he calls it. He has taken three rooms over
the market-place--where Bassett the dentist was--has hired an old
sailor and his son as assistants and already has some
clients.</p>

<p>Little Longstaffe of St. Paul's has taken him up warmly, old
Bently of the Bank goes to him to get his stomach down, and they
say that the Choir School is going to have him for some hours a
week, and that even THE School itself may condescend to give him
work.</p>

<p>It might easily develop into a craze here. During the last few
years every one has been after any new thing, and what with Mrs.
Sheringham and the Pageant last year, and the Regatta, and doing
"Elijah" in the Cathedral, and the Benson Company coming to the
Assembly Rooms, there's no knowing where we may end. I'm sure I
wish Johnson or Johanson, or whatever his name is, all the luck.
They can't manage his name here, and every one calls him Harmer
John, and that will stick, I should think.</p>

<p>Personally and privately he isn't as tiresome as I at first
expected. He hasn't impressed upon me any more of his views about
the goodness of humanity; he is, in fact, a great deal more
practical than I had fancied him, but if I were responsible for
him (which, thank God, I'm not), two things would worry me.</p>

<p>One is that he got the rooms, or did the business of getting
them, through Fletch. Now Fletch hates him--hated him on
sight--and is of course a perfect devil in anything to do with
money. I tried to warn him about Fletch, but he only laughed and
said that he had been kind to him and made him special terms, and
that he was sure that he was honest. Fletch honest!</p>

<p>The second thing is our dear little friend Maude. The man is
fascinated by her, and in that, to do him justice, there's
nothing very remarkable. She has fascinated plenty before him.
She's the prettiest girl in the place, and she has ways . . . !
Moreover, she herself is really taken with him, his physique, I
suppose, his laugh and the rest. Then he's really something new
for her. She has never been farther than a trip to Drymouth, and
the men of this town are not Adonises. She is determined to catch
him, and dances round him like a puppy round a juicy bone.</p>

<p>There is something good in the girl, I daresay. I have never
been able to be fair to her. She's so young that her character
can't be formed yet, and he may form it for her. They go for
walks together; she's been several times to his gymnasium. The
trouble is that she's bone selfish. He'll please her until she's
tired of him. I don't know. As I say, this may change her. She's
become more serious in the last fortnight than I've ever before
known her.</p>

<p>She is nicer to me, too--quite polite, and when I went to bed
with one of my headaches the other night, brought me some tea
herself. We had a funny little conversation on that occasion. I
was lying there like an old scarecrow, sallow as a fog, and she
was looking lovely, all youth and life and colour.</p>

<p>"You don't like me, Miss Midgeley, do you?" she said. "You
never have. Why don't you?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother me with your questions," I said, "my head's too
bad."</p>

<p>"I'm not so silly as you think," she said. "I want to get away
from here and improve myself. What chance has a girl got in a
stuffy old town like this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," I answered, "there are plenty of ways of
improving yourself here if you like."</p>

<p>"I want to see foreign countries," she said. "Mr. Johnson's
been telling me wonderful things."</p>

<p>So he's been playing Othello to her Desdemona? But Desdemona
is not her type. Cressida, perhaps? And if Othello had married
Cressida? . . .</p>

<p><i>Feb.</i> 24.--The man's mad. Eaten up with idealism and
fantastic desires. He's been here a little over two months and he
wants to strip every Polcastrian naked, pull down the town, beat
drums in the Cathedral, anything impossible you like. We were a
funny lot the other night gathered in the kitchen (one of the
finest old rooms in Polchester, yes, or in England for that
matter). The wind was curling down the chimney, Ma Penethen and
Judy were playing patience, Fletch reading the paper, Maude
making eyes at Johnson.</p>

<p>Suddenly he comes out with it, speaking to the air--what he
wanted to do. WHAT he wanted to do! To have a wonderful town, a
town of craftsmen, modern Donatellos; to pull down the slums,
Seatown and the rest; to build magnificent streets up from the
river with statues and towers; to have the most splendid
architects, the most wonderful sculptors to come down to us and
start a school here; for every one in the town who cared for
beauty to work to make the town beautiful, to work not for gain
but for love of art and your country; even a little--one street,
a statue or two--and other towns would see, admire, and imitate;
to pay some great architect to design new buildings instead of
the Seatown slums; to develop our own school of craftsmen,
nineteenth and twentieth-century craftsmen, who would work with
their hands as they did in the Florence of the Renaissance--no
machinery, no ceaseless reproduction of beautiful things, but the
beautiful things themselves, each one made by the loving hands of
the loving craftsman. And with this we Polcastrians are to have
beautiful bodies, not too fat and not too scraggy, and we are to
have beautiful children, and to lead beautiful lives--jolly
lives, he explained, all of us in good health and loving one
another and speaking the truth and being jolly. Oh dear! Shades
of William Morris! The idiot! . . .</p>

<p>I burst forth. I couldn't see Fletch looking at him over the
top of his paper with those cold glass eyes without wanting to
protect him as though he had been a baby in a perambulator
playing with a snake. And yet I had to attack him. I did, too. I
asked him whether he knew our town, whether he knew the parsons
and the old women. I reminded him that only the other day he had
told me that he didn't want to change anybody, and that here he
was, propaganding with all the silly old-woman business that
cranks had tried over and over again--and always failed. He
looked at me as though he had been lost in sleep and I had jerked
him awake. He said, as he had said the other day, that he didn't
want to change anybody, but he thought people weren't as happy as
they might be or as beautiful as they ought to be, and that if a
few saw things as he did they could band together and do a
little, and that then others perhaps would join them. He said
that he had always thought that it would be nice to have a few
men and women working together as they used to in Florence. He
knew that many others had tried it, but they hadn't altogether
failed if they had worked hard. That there was the most wonderful
Cathedral here, and that he loved the town because his mother had
lived near to it. But that he didn't want to alter anybody. . . .
He only dreamt sometimes . . .</p>

<p>Then Maude broke out, jumping up and banging on the table. She
thought Mr. Johnson's ideas were beautiful and that I was always
down on everything, and then to every one's amazement she burst
into tears and rushed out of the room. Johnson got up and stood
staring after her, his eyes shining. All Fletch said was, slowly,
"Pull down Seatown! Why, Mr. Johnson, you don't understand things
here!"</p>

<p>And all the shadows in the Cathedral pressed close and
listened with their ears up against the wall, and a little titter
went down the nave, the echo of an echo! I heard it behind the
rustle of Fletch's paper.</p>

<p>Johnson stood there looking at the door through which Maude
had flung herself, as though carved in stone. Then he turned
round to me.</p>

<p>"You was talking sense, I'm sure, Miss Midgeley," he said. "I
dream sometimes, and it's foolish to dream aloud. I don't hope
Miss Penethen's really upset."</p>

<p>That brought out from Judy a ferocious, "Oh, Maude's all
right. Don't you worry."</p>

<p>Then he sighed as a dog does just before it settles to sleep,
and sat down at the table again.</p>

<p>Am I a little queer, I wonder, living in this funny old house
so long? Am I being drawn back into life again? Is it against my
own will? I like him. How can I help it? He would drag the
maternal out of any woman--yes, even out of me. And on the other
side of the wall they titter, I am sure, long after I am
asleep.</p>

<h1>PORTRAIT OF THE HERO</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>"Your hot water, Mr. Johnson."</p>

<p>He almost slipped on the white stone, turning back for a
moment to catch the reflection of the light on the green sloping
lawn as it ran like bright water down the sharp hill. The house
was extraordinarily quiet around him--not a sound. He turned from
the steps, opened the door on his right and stared, as though
drunk with the delight of it, at the long high room with the
white walls, the bare gleaming floor flooded now with sun. What
would he have here? Only two pictures. And two statues. The
Donatello "Amourette"--the boy with his foot on the snake at the
farther end, and there in that corner by the door the "David,"
the David with the helmet. . . . Nothing else.</p>

<p>"Your hot water, Mr. Johnson."</p>

<p>He turned reluctantly from the room and, standing still,
sniffed the sharp morning air, heard suddenly the birds beyond
the door at the bottom of the white steps, heard the trees
knocking, ever so softly, their heads together, saw through that
gap in the branches that was so wonderfully right that he never
<i>could</i> believe that it was accidental, the faint line of
the dim plum-coloured hills. The voice of one bird rose in a thin
flute-like cry above the others, and the peace of the house rose
beautifully, nobly to meet it. The purple shadow of the trees in
their spring dress seemed to slip very faintly across the sunny
hall. A clock struck.</p>

<p>Then--knock, Knock, KNOCK.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson, your hot water--half-past seven."</p>

<p>Slowly he opened his eyes, rubbed his hand across them, then
scratched and ruffled his tangled hair. The little dark room met
his gaze. He could hear the rain drizzling against the window. In
the centre of the room on the oil-cloth stood the tin bath filled
with water the night before. A large square patch of grey sky,
like a sheet sagging with moisture, stretched beyond the window.
There was the faded green wall-paper with the pink roses, and the
mottle-coloured wardrobe, and the chest of drawers with the
looking-glass that was for ever suddenly jerking forward and
striking you.</p>

<p>In another moment he was out of bed, had gone to the door and
brought in the hot water, had crossed to the open window, looked
out on rain-scarred Canon's Yard and the grey butting end of the
Cathedral. A moment after that his pyjamas were on the floor and
he was in his bath, then, naked before the window, was doing his
exercises, his mind utterly concentrated upon them, although for
how many years now had he done them without missing a day? But he
could only think of one thing at a time, and that thing must be
whatever he was at the moment doing. One--two--three. Eight,
left, left, right. Down to the toes. Up again. Above the head . .
.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked in the glass. Every morning there was
this same anxiety. Was he out of condition, becoming fat
anywhere? Any signs of a belly? His chest, his thighs, his
buttocks? No, his face was the fattest part of him. The
chubbiness of his cheeks was his old enemy. But that had always
been so. He passed his hands down his thighs, hard like iron,
touched his toes, then fell to on the exercises again furiously.
He counted. Thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four--enough for
to-day.</p>

<p>Rubbing himself he began to hum; then slowly, mysteriously the
scene that he had left on opening his eyes began to steal back to
him, the high white staircase, the gentle sunlight, the empty
white room, the plum-coloured hills . . .</p>

<p>He stopped whistling, stared in front of him, lost, gone away,
his eyes seeming to film with some dim shadow. The Cathedral
struck the quarter. With a jerk he was back, in his shirt,
shaving, cursing the razor-blade, finding a collar, pulling on
the blue trousers, brushing his hair with a kind of windmill
movement, singing now, fastening up his boots--then, just once
again before he left the room, staring at his bed as though he
might recover. . . .</p>

<p>He was well accustomed now to that scene in the old kitchen,
but never came down the little staircase without pausing before
he pushed back the door, because he hoped--what did he hope?</p>

<p>He looked in through the door, lowering his head, and saw them
all there, Mrs. Penethen, Judy, Miss Midgeley, Fletch, all at
their breakfast, that extraordinary habit of these English to
stuff themselves with food early in the morning before the day
has properly begun!</p>

<p>He adored the kitchen with its huge fire-place, its immense
beams, its uneven brick floor, its whitewashed walls, its heavy
oak door. "The finest kitchen in Polchester," he said to himself,
"and here am I living in it. I find it first shot." The room had,
too, some of the happiness and warmth that comes from continuous
habitation. The whole life of Mrs. Penethen's household hung
about it. The sitting-room on the next floor with its stuffed
birds behind glass, its feathery everlastings, its green plush
table-cloth, was dead as a coffin. All the life was here and the
kitchen knew it.</p>

<p>They seemed a silent breakfast party. Somebody was missing.
Maude, of course. Down at eight o'clock in the morning she never
could manage to be. She always so intended. "See you at
breakfast, Mr. Fletch," she would say, and now, to Johanson,
"You'll see me on your way through in the morning, Mr.
Johnson"--but of course he did not--no, he never did. He could
imagine her curled up in bed like a little cat, her cheek on her
hand, her lovely hair scattered over the pillow. . . .</p>

<p>They seemed a dull enough party without her. Not one of
them--Mrs. Penethen, Miss Midgeley, Judy, Fletch--could be called
talkative. But as he passed through they all, save Judy, smiled.
Fletch said, raising his yellow pate, "Wet morning, Mr. Johnson."
Mrs. Penethen said something, and that funny cross-patch of an
old maid something sharp, and he replied with a laugh and a joke,
turned once towards the door to see whether it would not open,
then shouldered his way out into the rain.</p>

<p>Already, during the few weeks that he had been in the place,
he had made numbers of friends on his way down to the market. In
Canon's Yard there was the old cobbler who, like Hans Sachs,
chose to sit in his doorway from morning to night hammering at
his shoes; there was the butcher at the very end of the Yard;
then the stationer's assistant in Bodger's Street, pimply and
sallow-faced; then the old barber with a black patch over one
eye, who stood in his doorway chatting during so great a part of
the day that it was difficult to see when he did any work; after
these, who were all now accustomed to see the tall, smiling,
broad-shouldered man striding past, there were the birds and the
trees of green flame; then at the top of Orange Street the
Monument, whose frock-coated hero seemed to bend forward and give
Johanson a special gracious bow; then down Orange Street there
were the maids scrubbing the steps of the neat little houses (all
lawyers and doctors surely), and on the right St. Paul's and the
house, where his friend Tom Longstaffe lived, already so great a
friend of his that it was difficult not to step in across the
lawn and look in through the bow window and greet him at his
breakfast; then, at the bottom of Orange Street, the shops
beginning, the really smart shops, shops as smart as any in the
High Street--Polrudden's, the hairdresser's, Crack's, the
confectioner's (Mrs. Crack, orange hair, often in the doorway and
always ready with a smile for Mr. Johanson); and so into the
market-place, where already the day was in full bustle and the
old apple-woman was arranged under her green umbrella, and the
cabs were drawn up in a row along the cobbles, and the stalls in
the dark cloister market were opening. So, with smiles to Mr.
Fletcher, the cabman, and more smiles to Beckit, another cabman
(shabbier than Fletcher), and a nod to Mr. Green in his doorway
(the smartest hairdresser in Polchester); so, a step aside into
Pinner Street, through the door, up the broad stone staircase,
past the first floor (W. Quid, Solicitor, left side--Mund &amp;
Son, Provision Merchants, right side), on to the second floor.
One moment to look with pride at the brass plate:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">HJALMAR JOHANSON,</p>

<p align="CENTER">Gymnastic Instructor.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Hours, 9-6.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Saturday, 9-1.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>and so into the home of health and vigour and physical beauty,
the sacred dwelling-place whence all the future strength and
glory of Polchester life was to issue.</p>

<p>The sacred dwelling consisted of three rooms--a little room
first, and that was the office; a large one second, and that was
the room for exercise and drill; and a little room third, and
that was the room for private examination and consultation.</p>

<p>The little first room was furnished with some things that
Johanson had bought from the last tenant, the dentist: a decent
red carpet, a solid office table, four chairs--and a portrait of
the King and Queen of Sweden over the fire-place (these brought
from Copenhagen). At the table there was seated a boy of about
eighteen. He had yellow untidy hair, freckles, a thin, pointed
face and a very high white collar. He looked up when Johanson
came in and smiled with the whole of his large mouth.</p>

<p>This was Fred Trenant, only son of Billy Trenant, Johanson's
assistant. Fred was a clever boy with a real head for figures. He
had been in a bank two months ago, hating it, and when his father
went to Johanson he had insisted on going too, "to manage his
affairs for him." His duties were:</p>

<p>1. To manage the accounts.</p>

<p>2. To deal with correspondence.</p>

<p>3. To interview strangers.</p>

<p>Of these three duties he loved most the last, having a glib
tongue, an engaging manner, and adoring his master so
passionately that it was not difficult to put a special urgency
into his voice when persuading hesitators. His faults were:</p>

<p>1. A passion for the worst and cheapest of cigarettes.</p>

<p>2. A tendency to magnify the achievements, virtues and
appearance of those whom he admired.</p>

<p>3. Untidiness.</p>

<p>Johanson smiled at him, hung his coat on a peg and went
through into the farther room. This room was bare and white. Its
furniture consisted in a pair of parallel-bars (second-hand from
Drymouth), a rather faded, battered "horse," a spring-board,
half-a-dozen pairs of dumb-bells, and around the whitewashed
walls a series of large photographs displaying Johanson in a
series of exercises. There were twenty of these.</p>

<p>When Johanson came in Billy Trenant was rubbing up the
parallel-bars, whistling through his teeth as though he were
scrubbing a horse. He was a short, square man with a very large
head thatched with stiff, wiry grey hair. His legs were short,
thick and sturdy, his back broad, his face red. He had a scar
across his forehead, and two fingers of the right hand had lost
their tips. These accidents had befallen him during his service
in Her Majesty's Navy, where he had been a gymnastic instructor
for twenty years.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival in Polchester Johanson had been told
of this man; it had seemed to him the very thing that he needed.
Billy lived in a very shabby pair of rooms with his son in
Seatown. He had a small pension and was a widower. Both father
and son lost their hearts to Johanson at first sight. Billy
adored physical strength and cleanliness; he also adored himself,
his comfort and his two shabby rooms; for no one else would he
have left them. He was an obstinate man, thought that he knew
everything about physical culture, was garrulous about himself
and his achievements; his brain was slow and his outlook upon
life immature. These things might mean trouble in the future, but
for the moment all was well.</p>

<p>Johanson, no dreamer now, but moving, the sure captain on his
accustomed deck, greeted Billy and went into the question of the
parallel-bars.</p>

<p>"They'm not as handsome as I'd like to have 'em," said Billy,
shaking his head. "In point of fact, they'm not handsome at
all."</p>

<p>"They'll do for the time," said Johanson. "We shall afford
better ones soon."</p>

<p>Billy shook his head. "The prettier to start with, the richer
to end with," he said. "When folks come along and see it all
shabby-like they'll be thinking the instructor's the same--not
worth their money."</p>

<p>Johanson was looking out of the window into the marketplace,
coloured now with figures, the sun shining on the cobbles bright
like jewels after the rain. He turned round and put his hands on
Billy's shoulders, looking down on him.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe in me, Billy," he said, ''we shall part
and be friends."</p>

<p>"I believe in 'ee," said Billy, looking up at him. "Fust
foreigner I ever took to. I ain't saying nothing agin they
bars--only that they ain't as fresh as I'd like 'em."</p>

<p>He shook his head rather like a dog out of the water. "You'm
powerful strong," he said. "You could pretty well throw me out o'
that there winder. . . . Well, well, I'm not so young as I
was."</p>

<p>Johanson moved off into the other room. "Now, Fred," he said,
"we shall look at the morning's letters."</p>

<p>Quite a number. One from a gentleman who was always dizzy when
he awoke in the morning, had tried every medicine and many
doctors, and now wondered whether exercises might not be what he
needed. One from a lady who had two children with perpetual
colds--would exercises be good for them? One from a firm of
sports providers in Drymouth; one from a vegetarian who would
like to join forces "for the good of humanity"--to preach
vegetables and exercises hand-in-hand--and one letter that shall
be given in full:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p align="RIGHT">3 PEPPER LANE, POLCHESTER.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR--Last night at the meeting of the Glebeshire
Antiquarian Society I had the great pleasure of a conversation
with the Reverend Thomas Longstaffe, Rector of St. Paul's Church
in this town. Before I go any further, I should say that I am an
Art Instructor, Teacher of Painting (oils and water-colours),
Drawing, Modelling in Wax, etc., etc. For twenty years now I have
instructed the Young Ladies of the High School of this town.
Thirty years ago I worked in the Art Schools of Paris and London,
my dear Father and Mother sacrificing their All that I might
benefit. I had in those far-gone days Great Ambitions, now, alas,
long quenched by the Waters of Disappointment. The Reverend
Thomas Longstaffe last night informed me of your arrival in this
town and of your desire to improve the Bodies of our
Fellow-Citizens. He informed me further of your enthusiasm and
Love for the Great Artists of the Italian Renaissance--for the
mighty Michael Angelo, the graceful Verrocchio, the tender Mino
da Fiesole, the beloved Donatello--and that, inspired by their
Glorious Masterpieces, you would revive in our town some of the
lost Arts and Handicrafts.</p>

<p>What a draught of nectar was this news to your humble servant
who more than thirty years back lit the fires of his Soul at the
Altars of Divine Art in Florence, in Rome and in Naples! May I
not come and call upon you? I know that your time must be
precious indeed, but I will not detain you for long, and, by your
courtesy, you will be blessing the lonely hours of your faithful
servant,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">BENJAMIN SHORTT.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Johanson turned to the boy. "Know any one called Benjamin
Shortt, Fred?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What! Old feller with long hair below his collar--looks as
though 'e never washed--teaches droring?"</p>

<p>"That sounds like it!"</p>

<p>"I know--used to go to the High School to teach the girls.
Hard luck on the girls!"</p>

<p>They started on the day's engagements. "Nobody this mornin',
sir," said Fred. "Mr. Barnstaple, 3 to 4, Major Comstock, 4.15 to
5.15. To-morrer mornin's the Choir School, 10 to 11. The Band of
Hope's comin' along to see you this afternoon, sir, leastways the
head man, Mr. Tittmuss."</p>

<p>"And what does he want?"</p>

<p>"Exercisin' the bodies of the Band of Hope, I shouldn't
wonder," said Fred, "and they need it. But he won't pay much.
Mean as mustard."</p>

<p>Johanson got up, stretching his long arms. "It's this hanging
about is the hardest," he said, talking to Fred as though he were
his equal in age, experience, size and authority. "I'm impatient.
I want to be forward with this. When I look out through this
window I would wish to go down into the market and bring them all
up here. They all of them wants something done to them. It's a
shame all men doesn't realise how strong they might be!"</p>

<p>"Most of 'em haven't got time, sir, I expect," said Fred. He
looked up with intense admiration at Johanson's size and
strength. "If you'd been born small and crooked," he said, "you
wouldn't <i>know</i> you were small and crooked. Leastways you'd
be proud of yourself for <i>being</i> small and crooked, think it
made you more interestin' or something."</p>

<p>Johanson laughed. "They are coming in all right, though,
aren't they, Fred? New ones every day."</p>

<p>Fred beamed. "Why, we're doing something wonderful, sir," he
said. "All the town's talking of us. We'll be famous right
through Glebeshire in a week or two!" The door-bell rang.
Johanson went through into the inner room. The door opened. Three
clergymen appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johanson in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Could he see me for a moment?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'd see <i>you,</i> sir, at any time." Fred's face
was teaming. This was Mr. Longstaffe, friend and chief supporter
of the establishment. With him the Reverend Canon Ronder, the
Reverend Canon Bentinck-Major, dignitaries of the Cathedral. An
important visit for the establishment.</p>

<p>Fred disappeared--reappeared.</p>

<p>"Will you come through, gentlemen? Mr. Johanson will see
you."</p>

<p>They went through to the inner room, the little one where
important interviews (this was the first the establishment had
encountered) were held.</p>

<p>Of the four men Tom Longstaffe was the most nervous and
self-conscious. That little man had the virtue or the defect
(whichever way this modern cynical world may see it) of greeting
a new friendship with terrific enthusiasm and of working in every
possible direction for that new friend like a little Mercury. He
had taken to this man quite enormously, taken to him for himself,
taken to him for the work that he wanted to do. There was nothing
this town needed so much as new physical vigour, something to
brace everybody up and send the citizens skidding along in fresh,
healthy directions.</p>

<p>Here was the very man, a man also who was himself after
Longstaffe's own heart in sincerity, honesty, courage. So far so
good, but the next step was difficult. Johanson and his little
gymnasium would never get anywhere without the patronage of
Polchester's Upper Ten, and Longstaffe had not himself penetrated
so deeply into the sacred circle that he was thoroughly at home
in there.</p>

<p>Everything was a little more difficult because of Johanson's
simplicity. Longstaffe was simple, but not so simple as Johanson.
Johanson, eager though he was for his venture to succeed,
confessing indeed to Longstaffe that he had put every penny of
his savings into it and that therefore succeed it must,
nevertheless seemed to fail to understand the real importance of
Ronder, of Wistons, of Mrs. Sampson, of Lady St. Leath. He was
convinced, it appeared, that all reasonable people would realise
at once the advantage of good health, the splendour of physical
fitness, and that the rest would follow. They were all, it
appeared, good and wise and intelligent. That there should be
cliques and rivalries and jealousies seemed never to occur to him
at all, and that he should go out and solicit favours was an
obvious impossibility. It was true that people were coming in
just now thick and fast, but when the novelty was over only the
patronage of the Cathedral, the School, the Cathedral set would
keep it going. Johanson was so simple about people that
Longstaffe could only wonder where, then, he had lived all his
days. Were they all angels in Scandinavia? Was no one false,
jealous, mean, spiteful, dishonest in Copenhagen?</p>

<p>Oh yes, there were such, Johanson did not doubt, but he had
been very fortunate. And he would be still more fortunate here.
Were not all Englishmen honest, and was not he, Johanson, a
wonderful reader of character? He could tell at a glance, he was
never deceived. And nine out of ten human beings were honest and
true. After all, he had seen the world. His father had been a bad
one. <i>There</i> was a bad man if you like, but he had never had
a proper chance, and when he was sober he was not so bad after
all. . . .</p>

<p>"But don't you understand," Longstaffe had broken in
desperately, "that in a little town like this there are dozens of
intrigues and sets within sets? It's always so in a small town.
You must choose your friends and stick by them--but you can't be
friends with every one."</p>

<p>Johanson had clapped Longstaffe on the shoulder with a mighty
smack. "Well, I shall stick by you," he said, "for ever"--which
finally had nothing to do with the real question. So, when
Longstaffe had met Ronder and Bentinck-Major in the High Street
and Ronder had stopped to talk and, soon afterwards, had
mentioned Johanson's name, and Longstaffe, on impulse, had asked
them to come with him to see him, he had wondered as he walked
with them through the marketplace whether he had been wise.
Johanson was a queer fellow. These were important men, and
Johanson might not realise it in the least . . .</p>

<p>It appeared that he did not. He was completely at his ease. He
asked them to sit down, and then stood opposite them leaning
against the wall, smiling upon them as though they were his
long-lost brothers.</p>

<p>Little Bentinck-Major was at once uneasy. As he explained
afterwards to his wife, "The fellow leaning against the wall
looked tall enough to go through the ceiling and broad enough to
break the window and door at the same moment without stirring. I
was sitting down, my dear, and although I am not exactly a dwarf,
never felt, physically, so small in my life." So he sat there
fingering his gold watch-chain, looking at his neat, shining
boots, touching, once and again, his neat, shining hair.</p>

<p>Ronder, on the other hand, was at his best. He liked this man
at first sight.</p>

<p>Ronder always liked men better than women, liked them better
and trusted them more. In the furthering of his many little
schemes and plans (schemes and plans never malevolent in their
intention) he found that women were easier to use and adapt, and
therefore he liked men better. He despised always his agents, and
when a man became soft and pliable in his hands he always noticed
that he had much in his character that was feminine. Here, he saw
at once, was a proper man. Himself was now growing much too fat,
and some exercises, some massage, perhaps, would be an admirable
thing. And upon that instant seizure on an opportunity for his
own increased personal comfort there began to work in him a
little moving pattern of possible combinations and developments.
This man might have his place in larger issues than the reduction
of Ronder's figure. You cannot be the most important man in
Polchester for ten years without much manipulation of human
beings, and the manipulation of human beings (always with good
intentions) was the very breath of Ronder's nostrils.</p>

<p>Yes, but Johanson was of course entirely unaware of all this.
What, at first, he was mainly aware of (as he told Longstaffe
afterwards) was Ronder's figure. He had not for a long time seen
anything so fat and round and also so neat and shining. Fat men,
he had often noticed, were as a rule untidy, creased as to their
garments, unbrushed and spotted. But Ronder was a miracle of
smartness from the tips of his boots to the splendour of his
admirably parted hair. His face (that of a blooming cherub) was
kindly indeed, his expression clever and animated. In three
minutes Johanson liked him very much indeed.</p>

<p>Ronder, in fact, took trouble to be his most charming, and how
charming that could be every one in Polchester by this time well
knew. So genuine, too. When his heart wanted to burst through his
waistcoat he allowed it to burst through; the pleasantest
sensation he knew--like a thorough and hearty sneeze. He loved to
be moved warmly towards people--he was moved warmly towards
Johanson now.</p>

<p>The little meeting ended by being a great success. Johanson
did not say very much. Ronder talked for everybody. This was
exactly, in his opinion, what Polchester needed. He knew that it
was what he, Ronder, needed. Johanson might count on his hearty
co-operation. It was not much that he could do, but he had his
little influence in the place, and, such as it was, it should be
all at Johanson's service. Then there was the School--THE School.
Would Johanson have time for some work up there? He thought that
a word from him in that direction . . . He had some slight
influence. . . .</p>

<p>Longstaffe, watching his friend, was immensely relieved.
Johanson took Ronder's advances just as they should be
taken--with friendliness but no sycophancy, thanking him but with
no effusiveness, looking him straight between the eyes, and
shaking hands so heartily at the last that the Canon's bones must
have remembered for a good hour afterwards.</p>

<p>"I don't hope," Johanson said at the last with his courteous
bow, "that you shall think that what we have here is as it will
be. Everything begins. I mean that the continuation shall be very
good."</p>

<p>He suddenly turned on Bentinck-Major, who was picking his way
delicately like a hen round the parallel-bars.</p>

<p>"I do hope you like it," he said rather as a child might who
has built a castle of bricks and turns to his father for
approval.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes," Bentinck-Major stammered
nervously--"Delightful! Delightful! Charming!"</p>

<p>Johanson tossed his head. "It shall be better," he said as
though Bentinck-Major had criticised him, "much, much
better."</p>

<p>In the outer room they saw as they came through an old man
waiting there. Not so old in years, perhaps, but shabby with that
hopelessness that can only come to a human being when he has
abandoned altogether even the semblance of a struggle.</p>

<p>He presented at first sight the image of a decayed actor in
the familiar Irving pattern--hooked nose, long wispy hair falling
over a greasy velvet collar, tightly buttoned long faded black
coat, thin bony frame, large patent-leather boots with a crack
across the toe. His face was anxious, submissive, a little
furtive.</p>

<p>Seeing Ronder and Bentinck-Major, who were, it appeared,
sufficiently well known to him to call a faint flush into his
sallow features, he bowed low. Ronder gave him a sharp glance. It
was as though he realised that now that he had taken Johanson
under his protection, had drawn him into the world of his
manoeuvres, he must attend to every detail of his circumstances,
to his visitors above all. They had become of great significance
to him.</p>

<p>He bowed to the shabby old man, repeated his assurances to
Johanson and departed, followed by Bentinck-Major.</p>

<p>Longstaffe for a moment remained. He knew this shabby figure
well enough, and felt impatient at his appearance there.</p>

<p>Were the charlatans and the beggars of the place already
gathering round his friend? He had himself a tender heart, but no
good could come from association with old back-me-downs like this
old Benjamin Shortt--right on the back of Ronder, too.</p>

<p>But Johanson apparently realised nothing of the kind. Fred
superciliously had given the old man's name--"You had a letter
from him this morning, sir"--and Johanson had at once gripped the
shabby one's dingy hand as heartily as before he had gripped
Ronder's plump one, and in his eyes shone a light of kindliness
and compassion. He turned to Longstaffe.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me? I must talk to my friend here. He has
written to me. Heartily thanks for your goodness in bringing your
friends to see me. One day I will show you how I am
grateful."</p>

<p>He put his hands on Longstaffe's shoulders, shaking him a
little. "Good-bye," he said. He burst out laughing. "That's a fat
clergyman," he said, "if he wants massage he will have it. And it
shall hurt too!"</p>

<p>Then he turned back and led the way into the other room,
followed apprehensively by Mr. Shortt. He sat the man down in the
chair but now occupied by Canon Ronder, then himself sat down
close to him, balanced on the end of the table, his long legs
swinging.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shortt, half an hour ago I read your letter. Thank you
for writing it. It was good of you."</p>

<p>The man's eyes filled with tears, filled too readily, a
cynical observer might have fancied. "Oh, Mr. Johnson, when our
friend Mr. Longstaffe--he seemed in something of a hurry this
morning I fancied--told me the other night of your projects and
ambitions for our town, my heart swelled with gladness, and I
said to myself, 'I will not delay, I will go at once and put
myself at the feet of this stranger who is realising at last
dreams--dreams--'"</p>

<p>He paused. He pulled out a very grimy handkerchief and wiped
his eyes. "Forgive me, sir," he said, "I have not been well of
late. . . . It is too much. . . ."</p>

<p>"You're hungry, that's what you are," said Johanson, "wait a
moment." He swung off the table and went out. Soon he returned.
"You will have some sandwiches in a minute. I've sent the boy
out. You can eat them in here where you shan't be
interrupted."</p>

<p>Mr. Shortt blinked his eyes. "Your goodness--coming after
these hard years. . . . Since my wife died five years ago I have
had nothing but tribulation. I must tell you," he hesitated, "in
my letter there was something that was untrue. It is two years
now since I last instructed the young ladies of the High School.
It was a foolish lie, because you would discover it so quickly. I
have here some drawings--" He fumbled with a dirty roll of
paper.</p>

<p>He produced something for Johanson's inspection. Johanson took
them in his hands. They were drawings, rather faded now,
copies--Michael Angelo's "Moses," Verrocchio's "Madonna and
Child" from the Bargello, a baby from one of Mino da Fiesole's
tombs, and here his beloved Donatello, two of them, the David
with the helmet and the St. George.</p>

<p>They had never been very good drawings, and now they were
faded and smudged, but Johanson's heart beat excitedly as he
looked at them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're in luck to have been there," he said. "Soon, when
this is successful, I too will go. We shall go together and then
return and have a school for sculptors and artists and painters
and make this town beautiful, keeping the old lovely things and
making new things in tune with them, and the Cathedral above all
. . . and fine men and women all working for the love of their
town. . . ."</p>

<p>He began to stride about the room.</p>

<p>The man watched him with blurred eyes which occasionally he
rubbed. Fred came in with a pile of sandwiches on a plate and a
bottle of Bass. Mr. Shortt gave him a sharp look to see whether
he were laughing or sneering at him, then between gulps and bites
he murmured, "Oh yes, indeed, . . . glor-i-ous . . . glor-i-ous!
Our beautiful town. . . . My dreams coming true, Mr. Johnson,
indeed they are. What is life but the pursuit of beauty? And all
these years I have been labouring in the wilderness alone--and
now at last when I had almost given up hope." A tear welled into
his eye and slowly trickled down his cheek, to mingle with the
crumbs of sandwich on his chin.</p>

<p>Johanson turned round abruptly and stood over him. He was
tremendously excited. He raised his arms. That already when he
had been in the place only a month or two men and women should be
springing from the very stones of the city as it were to join him
with their enthusiasm!</p>

<p>"We can found our school here, we can make it perhaps famous
throughout the country--a new life, simpler, kinder, a new town
rising out of the beautiful old one, every one happier!"</p>

<p>He wrung Mr. Shortt's hand again. "All your life you have
worked here and not seen your dreams realised, now at last they
may come true. . . ."</p>

<p>Mr. Shortt looked at the plate to see whether the sandwiches
were finished. They were. He rose slowly from the chair wiping
the crumbs from his mouth with a very dirty handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, Mr. Johnson, this is a very great moment in
my life. You can be assured now and always of my cordial
co-operation. This is truly a happy day for me." He paused,
looking anxiously about him. "There is one little matter," he
glanced down at his boots; "coming this morning I was compelled
to miss a possible engagement. Five shillings would, I imagine,
cover the loss. I quite understand, of course, if you find it
impossible--"</p>

<p>Johanson had not heard him. He was staring towards the window.
"Five shillings would cover--" repeated Mr. Shortt anxiously.</p>

<p>Johanson wheeled round. "What's that? Five shillings? Why, of
course. . . ." From his trouser-pocket he produced some silver.
"There, Mr. Shortt. Come and see me soon again, remember. We
shall have much to discuss. . . ."</p>

<p>Fred appeared in the doorway. "Two ladies to see you, sir," he
said. Mr. Shortt started apprehensively. "Well, well, I must
hasten back to my work. I have found a friend, Mr. Johnson. I
shall never forget that to-day I have found a friend. . . ."</p>

<p>He shuffled off. In the outer room he almost shuffled into
Mrs. Penethen and her daughter Maude. He bowed and, his head
bent, disappeared through the door.</p>

<p>Miraculous morning! Johanson in his happiness could have
kissed Mrs. Penethen, who greeted him with her customary severe
smile.</p>

<p>"I have no right to intrude, Mr. Johnson," she said, "I can
see that you are very busy, but we are passing and I have a
little matter that will take me only a minute to discuss with
you."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, smiling at Maude, "I am delighted to see
you."</p>

<p>They moved, the three of them, into the little room, and all
stood together looking out of the window on to the marketplace,
now soaked with sun under a faint pigeon-blue sky. What Mrs.
Penethen wanted to say was that March 13 was Maude's birthday and
she intended to give a little party. Would Mr. Johnson honour
them with his presence? Only perhaps a dozen people--Mr. Ben
Squires, her brother-in-law, Mrs. Boultewood (a friend from
girlhood) and her daughter, Miss Midgeley and Mr. Fletch, and one
or two more? In the kitchen, of course, supper and then a dance.
They would have old Mr. Harty, who played the fiddle like a
two-year-old. Now, what Mrs. Penethen wanted to ask was not only
would Mr. Johnson come, but would he ask his friend Mr.
Longstaffe? Did he think that he dared? It would be so nice to
have a clergyman, and Mr. Longstaffe was so popular. It would
just give a finish to the evening. Mrs. Penethen didn't dare
herself . . . but perhaps Mr. Johnson wouldn't mind. . . .</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'll ask him!" Johanson cried, "and I'm sure
he'll come unless he have some other engagement. I'll ask him,
that's certain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen's stern features relaxed as she thanked him.
What a charming place he had here. It really was charming. She
moved into the other room to examine everything and began one of
her dignified polite conversations with Billy. The other two
remained beside the window.</p>

<p>They spoke no word. Johanson, staring down into the
market-place, saw nothing. Slowly, as though a thin paper sheet
had been held before his eyes and was suddenly split by some
strong hand, he beheld the scene of his now so familiar dream. He
heard the fountain. The long white staircase came into view, the
cool of the dark sheltered garden, the long, high, empty room
with the shining floor, utter peace, the voice of the birds.</p>

<p>He had never known such happiness. In another moment he would
be shown the secret of life, some secret so simple that it would
be amazing that for so long every one could have been so
blind--</p>

<p>He turned to the girl. Almost on his lips were the words,
"Come and see my garden. It is so quiet there and no one will
interrupt us. . . ." The girl's hand touched the back of his.
"Well, Mr. Johnson, we must be getting along," she said almost as
though she had been waiting for something that had not happened,
and was disappointed. "We've got ever so much to do this
morning."</p>

<p>She waited yet a moment looking up at him. She knew that she
was bewitching when she looked up at some one, her chin tilted
ever so slightly. Then, as he did not move, she turned with a
little shrug of her shoulders and walked out of the room.</p>

<h1>FRIENDSHIP: MARCH WEATHER</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>However tightly I stretch out the quivering elastic of my
memories, I can summon up no vision of a time when I was not
conscious of our Cathedral.</p>

<p>When I was very small it came to me with two quite separate
personalities, the distant, magical, mysterious one, an animal
with grey ears, a ship with silver masts, a box ruby-coloured, a
net salmon-tinted, always above the town, separated from it,
swinging with its own life in space--the other the long shining
distending nave with its slippery floor, down which our family,
always late, would self-consciously clatter, the heads on either
side turning as we moved, the verger undoing the cord for us, the
pause, the choir slipping past, the cold clear voice of the
Precentor.</p>

<p>It was not until I was much older that the inside of the
church approached me--and that on a never-forgotten day when,
having nothing to do, urged by the lovely evening to wait a
moment before going home, I slipped in, was caught by the grey
cloud of the dusky walls and pillars, and then saw, suddenly
flaming, the windows near the King's Chapel, all six of them, the
windows known as "the Virgin and the Children." These were, with
the exception of the great Rose window at the East end, the
oldest in the Cathedral. In one of them the Virgin Mary, in a
purple gown, bent down over a field of lilies to watch the baby
Christ at play; in another the Christ and St. John paddled in a
stream while Mary watched them from the windows of a crooked
house set in a cup of hills; in another children were running in
a crowd after a white kid and Mary held back her Son, who
stretched out his arms after his playmates; in another Joseph was
in the workshop, Jesus was sitting on the floor looking up, and
the Virgin, in a dress of vivid green, stood over him, guarding
him; in another they were walking, Father, Mother and Child, up
the steps of the Temple, watched by a group of grave old men; in
another Jesus was playing at his Mother's feet, while an ox, an
ass and three strange dogs with large black eyes seemed to be
protecting them.</p>

<p>On this late afternoon the sun lit the windows with a rage of
colour, and every detail of colour was visible to me. More than
the central figures the detail of the backgrounds fascinated me,
the little roads winding into purple hills, the stiff trees so
vividly green, the white castles like toys on craggy rocks,
little boys with networks of shipping, and then suddenly the
colour was so intense--the purple, the green, the crimson, the
pale silver white, the dark ruby red--that I lost the detail and
seemed to swim through the dusk of the darkening church on a
jewelled carpet to heaven.</p>

<p>From that day the Cathedral was mine; I seemed to know it all,
from the Black Bishop's tomb with its wonderful green stone to
the smallest babyest cherub hiding in the right-hand corner of
the monument to Henry, eighth Marquis of Brytte.</p>

<p>The history of that monument was a strange one. Henry, eighth
Marquis of Brytte, the last of his family, the oldest perhaps of
all Glebeshire's great families, spent the last years of his long
life at Brytte Court, ten miles from Polchester, and died in
1735. He had done many things during his lifetime for our town,
which he loved, and, of course, we gave him a monument. A curious
thing happened. A local artist was discovered, a young man Simon
Petre, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the old Marquis, who, learning
of the boy's talent, had sent him to London, Paris and finally to
Italy. He came back a sculptor of fine promise. His benefactor's
monument was his first public commission. He worked at it for a
year and a half and died of some queer fever a week or two after
finishing it. He was a poet too, young Simon Petre, and a writer
of no mean prose. After his death a little memoir with some poems
and an Italian diary were published. The book has vanished now,
but I have a copy, <i>The Life and Remains of Simon Petre,</i>
London, 1739--a small brown book stamped in thin gold. There are
some curious things in that Italian diary and one little
section--"A Florentine Adventure"--that may one day be
re-published--curious and unusual at least, saturated with the
decadent colour of that place at that period.</p>

<p>I, of course, had never been to Italy when I decided that for
myself the "Virgin and Children" windows and the Brytte Monument
were the loveliest things in our Cathedral. It is certain,
though, that Mino da Fiesole himself would not disdain the babies
crowding at the head and feet of the recumbent figure--the
loveliest babies, some laughing, some grave, one with his finger
on his lips, one looking back, calling to his friend, two bending
forward, their chubby fingers on one another's
shoulders--adorable, adorable babies making perfect the delicacy
of the lace-like background, the strength and dignity of the
simple figure, the symmetry and pattern of the wings of the
guarding Angel.</p>

<p>In this thing at least Johanson and I were one--it was this
monument that at once won his heart.</p>

<p>One of the most mysterious elements in the whole of his story
is his connection with the Cathedral. After tradition had set to
work and had piled absurdity on absurdity it became the habit to
acclaim him a kind of St. George defending the Cathedral from its
many foes. I believe the truth to be exactly the opposite. His
religion was Protestant of the plainest, simplest kind; he
repeatedly exclaimed against what seemed to him the falseness and
flummery of the Cathedral life, but what caught him, I fancy, was
its Past, its beautiful, romantic, fighting, poignant Past.</p>

<p>He found here, as he had found nowhere in his own Scandinavia,
the work of the craftsman, striving with his hands to make Beauty
for the World that he loved. He found it in the floor, in the
roof, in the pillars, in the windows, in the Cloisters, in the
Bishop's tomb, in the Brytte Monument--in the Brytte Monument
above all. That must have been, at his first vision of it, as
though it had stepped straight out of his beloved "Donatello"
book (<i>Donatello,</i> by Lord Balcarres, Duckworth, 1903). And
then when behind the sight of it he learnt the history of young
Simon Petre, it must have seemed to him as though here, right
before his eyes, was the very example of native craftsmanship for
which he had been longing ever since he set foot in our town. A
boy of the town, born and bred here, returning to it, doing his
first work in the heart of it and for very love of it, and doing
it so beautifully too! I believe that from the moment when he
heard the history of young Simon Petre he felt that that same boy
was at his side, caring for him, encouraging him, urging him on.
. . . Something that he said afterwards, just before the end, to
Mary Longstaffe . . . but that is a later story.</p>

<p>On a certain day he lunched with the Rev. Thomas at St. Paul's
Rectory and went with him afterwards to a football match--a day
that they were never, either of them, to forget.</p>

<p>Leaving the Choir School, where he had been drilling the choir
boys for a most strenuous hour, he looked into the Cathedral for
one moment before going on to the Rectory.</p>

<p>The nave was deserted save for three visitors, who were being
conducted by Cobbett, the Verger, seventy years of age now, as
brisk as a young bee, but with some of the pomposity proper to
his office.</p>

<p>He knew Johanson by this time and greeted him with fitting
dignity. He liked Johanson. The fellow made no fuss, was always
cheery and respected Cobbett's office. Moreover, Cobbett's
youngest was at the Choir School and was already ecstatic over
Johanson's physical prowess.</p>

<p>"This," he said to the three visitors, a burly man, a timid
woman and a little girl with creaking shoes, "is known as the
Brytte Monument. A work in commemoration of Henry, eighth Marquis
of Brytte. . . ."</p>

<p>They gaped, gasped, and moved on. Soon the only sound was the
creaking shoes of the little girl. A faint, very faint, breeze
seemed to whisper round the dim corners of the distant pillars.
The floor was like a lake, the colours from the "Virgin" windows
faintly staining it. Johanson held his breath, staring up at the
clustering babies until they seemed to move, to turn towards him,
smiling, inviting him.</p>

<p>Oh! if only things turned out as he hoped, what would he not
do here, for the town, for the Cathedral, perchance for England!
It had all begun so marvellously, he coming as a stranger, swept
into the town, as it were, by a torrent of rain--</p>

<p>He drew himself up and a prayer formed in his heart, a prayer
without words, and he felt again an ecstatic vision, of worship
towards the beauty that he felt in the world, of humility in the
face of his own capacities, of happiness because every one was so
good to him. He liked to be liked, he liked to have friends, he
liked to be moving in tune with the life around him; he felt an
intense gratitude because of the love in the world.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," the words formed in his heart. "I'll work
as I have never worked before--I'll spare nothing--I'll give
myself utterly. I have found at last the work that I was put into
the world to do."</p>

<p>And before he turned away he seemed to hear the friendly voice
in his ear of that strange young man, and to see at his side the
thin face, the burning eyes. . . .</p>

<p>He left the Cathedral and went through Bodger's Street and
Green Lane to St. Paul's.</p>

<p>Old Hephzibah looked after Tom Longstaffe like a cat after her
only kitten. She was a short stout woman with the coal-black hair
that one so often finds in Glebeshire people, an inheritance from
those ancestors who once invaded the Glebeshire shores in their
pirate ships and put the Glebeshire wastes to fire and sword and
then settled there and begat children of the women they
spared.</p>

<p>Warm of heart, irascible, impetuous and untidy, Hephzibah made
of the Rectory a haystack. Nothing was in its right place, and
Tom was too busy to care. The two men sat down to a meal that was
dumped down on the table anyhow. They didn't notice. They had
other things to think about. Tom was in tremendous spirits and
very soon he gave his friend the reason.</p>

<p>"My girl's coming home next week," he said. He paused,
suddenly looking sharply at Johanson. This was the first time
that he had mentioned his girl to his friend. Johanson must have
heard some gossip. This thing was nearer to his heart than
anything else in the world. What would Johanson say?</p>

<p>Johanson had heard nothing. His face lit up.</p>

<p>"You have a daughter? You never told me."</p>

<p>"I was waiting until we had a time really alone. My girl is
more to me than all the rest of the world put together. She's
been living in London for seven years. She's very clever. She's a
journalist and makes a good income."</p>

<p>"She's all alone in London?"</p>

<p>"She has a boy of six."</p>

<p>"What does her husband do?"</p>

<p>"She's not married."</p>

<p>The colour rose in Longstaffe's face. "I'm prouder of her,
Johanson, than I can ever say. Don't you make any mistake about
that. She lived here with me, of course. We were splendid
together, never a cross word, perfect confidence, love such as
father and daughter can seldom have had. She met a young fellow,
son of an Army officer here. She told me something about it. I
was pleased because I liked the boy. But his father had great
ambitions for him, and wouldn't consent to an engagement. I
should have stopped her then perhaps seeing him, but I couldn't.
She loved him so, and I thought the old man was coming round. He
was, I think. No one could resist Mary once they knew her. Then
the boy was killed in an accident. A month later Mary told me
that she was going to have a baby."</p>

<p>"Poor girl, poor girl!" said Johanson.</p>

<p>"Then we had our first difference--the first in all our lives
together. Mary was happy. She stayed on here, not caring what any
one said or thought. She said she was glad that he had left
something of himself that she could keep. That he would always be
with her through the child. . . . The people here, of course,
were very hostile. I had my own struggle. She had committed, by
my own lights of everything in which I had been taught to
believe, a great sin. I tried to speak to her of that, but I
broke down. She seemed suddenly to know so much more of life than
I. And if you love some one truly, how can you change, especially
if they are in trouble and disgrace?</p>

<p>"But she felt after a time that she was doing me harm here, my
church and my congregation. So she went away. Her baby was born,
a boy. She lived in London and began to write, and, as I say, has
been very successful. I needn't tell you, Johanson, how I've
missed her--it's been an agony sometimes--but I wouldn't press
her to come back. I couldn't, when I knew of the way they might
treat her here. But at last she has insisted. She is coming back
with the boy next week."</p>

<p>The look that the two men exchanged settled their friendship.
It had its birth in that first moment of meeting, that misty day
in the Cathedral Precincts, it had had its growth through their
happy and easy comradeship of the last few weeks, now it was
certain. No separation of time or place could change it.</p>

<p>"My heartliest thanks for telling me," Johanson said. "It will
be fine to know her."</p>

<p>After the meal Longstaffe took his friend over the house. It
was one of those old rambling spidery houses that are so
especially English, and then still more especially Glebeshire. In
the upper rooms there was a smell of apples and candle-grease. In
the attics there were torn wall-papers and supplements from the
Christmas numbers tacked on to the walls, and out of the attic
windows there were views of Polchester, smoky orange in the
spring weather, with the Cathedral sailing through the air. The
house was a mess. Fine though Hephzibah was, the house was a
mess. Longstaffe's bedroom was sad to see--drawers were half
opened, ties like tongues, collars like yawns hanging from them.
Over the back of the chair clothes were tumbled, shaving things,
the brush soapy, the razor gaping for a fresh victim, were lying
loosely on the dressing-table.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Tom Longstaffe, "I oughtn't to have
brought you in here."</p>

<p>Instantly Johanson was busy. The drawers were closed, the
clothes were folded and put away, the shaving things were in
their case.</p>

<p>He stopped in the middle of the room, his face flushed. "I do
beg your pardon. I had no right to do that. I could not bear to
see that confusion. It hurts. How can you live like that?"</p>

<p>Longstaffe looked rather like a scolded school-boy. Then
suddenly he roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Fancy you," he cried, "a man of your size putting those
things away. You're right, of course. I've lived in the most
awful mess here for years. I've never thought about it. But it's
the last thing I expected you to do."</p>

<p>Johanson suddenly came across to Longstaffe and putting his
hands under his shoulders lifted him into the air. "You're
getting fat," he said. He put him down, "You're having
stomach."</p>

<p>Longstaffe shook himself. "By Jove, you're strong--and yet you
put those clothes away like a fussy old bachelor."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not fussy. But untidiness, I hate it. It makes dirt.
This house, I should wash it all down with soap and water." He
suddenly looked anxiously at Longstaffe. "You aren't angry? I
don't think first. I do something and then I think afterwards. I
will be in trouble one day for that." He put his hands on
Longstaffe's shoulders: "You're not angry?"</p>

<p>"Angry?" said Longstaffe. "Why, I think you're the best fellow
I ever met."</p>

<p>They started off for the football match. Johanson and Tom
Longstaffe were both very simple men. Longstaffe had that
simplicity that is often to be met with in clergymen who have
lived good and pure lives, and who are not mentally very subtle,
who believe utterly in the dogmas of their religion, who have
lived for a long period in a rather remote place. They are moved
by feeling rather than thought, and their feelings are direct,
honest, and, as a rule, uncomplicated.</p>

<p>The problems that Longstaffe had hitherto in his life been
compelled to face, his problems of love, friendship and belief,
would have soon been constructed into complicated shapes had a
subtle brain worked on them, but Longstaffe's brain was not
subtle. He had that confidence in God which a small child feels
for his mother, and so all his earthly life was simplified.</p>

<p>Johanson was like Longstaffe in many ways, the reason perhaps
of the beginning of their friendship, and was unlike him in many
more, the reason undoubtedly of its continuance. In some things
he had not developed since he was a boy of fifteen, in his faith
in human nature, in his na&iuml;ve pleasure in his physical
strength, in his sudden angers and instant after-forgetfulness of
any grudge, in his impetuous enthusiasms, in his generosity, in
his sudden distresses and equally sudden joys--in all these
things he was a boy. But he had a nature capable of far deeper
complications than his friend's. He had the soul of the artist,
and therefore would know suffering, failure, strange longing,
deep loneliness, passionate regret, exquisite happiness as
Longstaffe would never know them. He had in him the artist's
complex of woman and man, masculine absolutely in his physical
self and its nature, feminine often in comprehension, sympathy,
and the longing for something that he would never attain. His
mixed blood, too, had flooded him with an imagination that
Longstaffe's English blood would never know. There were also his
dreams.</p>

<p>The two men moved up the hill, past the Monument, out on to
the road above the town. The day was one of a little group that
marked the end of winter and the beginning of spring. The trees
were yet bare, but from their heart there seemed to steal a faint
pink flush as though the sap that throbbed in their veins
prompted them already to some timid expression of their
approaching beauty. They stretched out their arms to a sky of
blue washed with water, and in this lake of thin colour shapes of
cloud-like swans floated gently, aimlessly, now in concert, now
singly, now fading, with an almost audible whisper of farewell,
into some farther silence. The fields and the grass and moss in
the hedges were of a bright sharp colour, not yet fully green,
but accentuated as though painted on china. Here and there a
primrose, a yellow eye, peeped out, wondering whether the world
were yet ready for its full approach. The road was hard and rang
beneath the men's feet, but here, too, there was promise of
warmth and running sap beneath the yielding frost.</p>

<p>When they reached the turn of the road both men instinctively
looked back. Polchester, like a child's collection of coloured
bricks huddled into a green basket, lay below them; from its
heart, a pennon of blue, the Pol streamed out to the hills and
the Cathedral rode over all.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't believe," said Longstaffe, "how I love that
place! After Mary, it is everything in this world to me. And you
wouldn't believe either," he added, "the intrigues and plots and
cabals that are going on there."</p>

<p>"You see it too close," Johanson said. "Look at it from above
and get your real picture. You must not be too near to a man, you
see only his waistcoat buttons. How beautiful that place is! I am
a man in luck to have found my home at last."</p>

<p>"And do you really feel this town in which you have been only
a few weeks to be your home more than the country in which you
have spent all your life?"</p>

<p>"I do so. We have all of us a dream-town, and my one was to be
always in England. You see, I loved my mother, and she, because
she were an exile, would always talk of England as of Paradise,
and it was <i>this</i> England that she talked about, the high
deep hedges, the grey cottages hanging with their toes to the
sliding hills, the sea on both sides, so narrow that one big wave
could sweep the country, the salt smell in the breeze, the women
with their black hair. . . . And my father was a bad man, so that
his country seemed unkind to me and unfriendly. He were bad
because he could not help himself; his lusts was so strong. He
must have a woman every minute, and always a new one, never the
same one twice. He did not care what he did to them, and yet my
mother loved him, always, to the very last of his life. She said
she liked him bad better than other men good. It were well, she
said sometimes, that he was so bad, because if he were good she
would die at once of such happiness. She said he was good, an
angel, just for two weeks after their marriage--wonderful--and
those two weeks was enough to have made living worth while.
English-women, I am sure, are very patient."</p>

<p>They were moving now between thick, high hedges that hid all
the world from them.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Longstaffe, "did you always, since you were
very small, mean to come to England?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always. I cannot remember the time when I did not dream
of it. I used to lead always two lives: the one that had my
father in it and earning my living, and all the daily Stockholm
life--that was fun, especially when we went out to the Islands,
and in the summer when we was all day in the water . . . and the
other when I would try to draw and paint and make things out of
coloured paper and ask my mother questions, and then at night I'd
dream!"</p>

<p>"So you're a painter too?" Longstaffe asked.</p>

<p>"No. I hadn't any gift. It was because I had not that I
determined to do what I might with my body. My strength seemed
the best thing I had. First, I was a model for artists, and then
a painter took interest in me and paid for my lessons in massage
and gymnastics. But it was not until I went to Copenhagen that I
saw really what I wanted."</p>

<p>"Don't the Danes hate the Swedes?" asked Longstaffe.</p>

<p>"Oh, hate! No. That's too much of a thing. But you know what
it is when people lives close to one another--they see the spots.
But they was kind to me in Copenhagen. Very kind. The Danes are
jolly people--they drink and laugh and make love all the time. I
soon had plenty of work--much as I could do. And good work. The
doctors they liked me and sent me their patients. And I had work
with the schools, too. And many friends. I was very happy."</p>

<p>"And, if it isn't impertinent, how was it you didn't marry?"
Longstaffe asked.</p>

<p>"I was too busy. Always I wanted to make enough to come to
England and see the place where mother was born. I hadn't time to
be in love. There was the beginnings, yes, of course. The Danish
women are very jolly, and they understand love, but when it came
to something serious--I had no time. I had a nice flat out in
Amager, and I worked from six in the morning until eleven at
night. I can tell you I was tired sometimes.</p>

<p>"Then one day a strange thing occurred. One day I was walking
by the shops and I saw a blue plate--one of those deep blues like
the sea. I thought it was the most beautiful colour I'd ever
seen. It wasn't glass, it were some sort of clay. I bought it and
took it home.</p>

<p>"I put it on the mantelpiece of my sitting-room, and before it
had been there half an hour the mantelpiece looked shabby, so I
went out and bought two pictures--prints of Copenhagen. In the
evening I was looking up at that plate, and the rug in front of
the fire were so faded I was properly ashamed of it. So in the
morning I went out and bought a new rug, a good one, purple
colour to go with the plate. Then I had a terrible time.
Everything in the room looked wrong by that rug--old shabby
things, no sort of use. I cleared them all out. The room was
bare. I whitewashed the walls. I put my money together and bought
a Zorn etching. It was like a fever, then. It spread to my other
rooms, then my clothes, then the view out of my windows. My flat
looked on to a blank wall. I changed the flat and got another
that looked over the water and the trees. Then one day in a
bookshop window I saw a book open, and one page had Donatello's
'David,' and the other one of his prophets for the Florence
Cathedral. I couldn't forget that prophet all day. I went back
the next morning and bought the book. That morning my life
changed. I said, Why shouldn't it be now once again in the world
as it was then--why shouldn't we build towns in which everything
was beautiful, lovely streets, wonderful statues?</p>

<p>"And I thought of England and that town my mother had talked
about with the Cathedral, and I swore that one day I would go
there and would live there and work there, and--and--here I
am!"</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms. "And I'm happy. I've found my work
and my life, and every one are kind to me, and already I make a
living. Oh! how fortunate I have been!"</p>

<p>"And you don't feel," Longstaffe asked, "any sense of exile?
You're not home-sick?"</p>

<p>"No; how can I be? Is not this my home? Was not my mother born
here? And for that is not the world my home? Will I not go
afterwards to Italy and China and Spain and see all the wonderful
things men before me have made? All the world is my home."</p>

<p>Once again Longstaffe felt as he had done when first he had
heard his friend talking to Ronder--a wish to warn him that this
place into which he had come was not so simple and that these
people with whom he had chosen to live were neither so
straightforward nor so unsophisticated. But he could not. He
could say nothing. It might be that after all Johanson was seeing
them more truly than he. He had lived in the place so long. He
had his prejudices; especially he had them since Mary's disgrace.
What if Johanson after all did make the place different, the
place and every one in it? Did not people become what you thought
them? And might not some one as genuine and sincere as this man .
. . ?</p>

<p>But Ronder. And Bentinck-Major. And the Bishop. And men in the
town like that rogue Hogg. He would wait. At least Johanson had
made a good beginning. The Town, conservative to its core about
foreigners, nevertheless liked him. He heard nothing but good
reports of him. Every one seemed to be glad that he had come. He
would leave it alone and wait.</p>

<p>They had walked on a little while in silence when Johanson
said:</p>

<p>"Do you ever dream?"</p>

<p>"Dream?" Longstaffe laughed. "Too busy."</p>

<p>"No, but I mean at night. Do you ever have the same dream
again and again?"</p>

<p>"Why, I have a nightmare sometimes if I've been working too
late or eating something."</p>

<p>"No, not a nightmare. A happy dream. The vision of a place--a
house, a garden. Always the same house, very quiet, very
beautiful. Somewhere that is yours more than anything in real
life is, something so quiet and so still--"</p>

<p>Their road suddenly joined the other road from the town, the
St. Mary's Road, and they were caught in a throng of men and boys
who were going up to the football. Some one spoke to Longstaffe.
They were no longer alone.</p>

<p>They arrived at the field where the game was, passed through
the gate, paid their sixpences and walked forward.</p>

<p>Along the centre of one side there was a rough-and-ready
stand, but most of the company were lining up beside the ropes
and Johanson and Longstaffe did the same. They had scarcely taken
their places when the teams ran out on to the field.</p>

<p>"It's South <i>versus</i> North Glebeshire," Longstaffe
explained. "A very important game. It's the last of the season, a
return match. The North won in the game before Christmas, but
only just, twelve points to nine, so we're bent on winning this
time."</p>

<p>Johanson had never seen a game of Rugby football before. They
played plenty of Association in Scandinavia, and he was himself a
good player. At once, when the Southern forwards had kicked off
and charged down the field, he sniffed the air, his heart began
to pound and his fingers to twitch. It was always so when he
watched any game. It was the same, too, with Longstaffe, and it
was as though the one electric current ran through the bodies of
the two men, eagerly hanging forward over the rope, pressed
shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Johanson very quickly picked up the main points of the game,
helped by Longstaffe. The principle was the same as in all the
other games in the world. At first the frequent blowing of the
referee's whistle and the many ensuing "scrums" troubled him, but
from the moment, about ten minutes after the start, when the
Southern three-quarters started down the field slinging the ball
from man to man, his excitement knew no bounds. He stamped with
his feet and shouted, crying, "Splendid! Splendid! Good! Very
good! Bravo!"</p>

<p>Longstaffe too was shouting like a man possessed, his little
twisted face purple: "Go on! Run yourself! Don't pass, Coppy!
Keep it! Keep it, you fool . . ." and then his voice suddenly
dropping, "What <i>did</i> he pass for? He'd have got in if he'd
held on!"</p>

<p>"Yes, damned fool," said a youth next to Longstaffe, sucking a
straw. "It was young Coppy let us down the last blasted time. Got
a match, mister?"</p>

<p>"That was fine," Johanson cried, his face flushed, his feet
still tapping the ground.</p>

<p>"We ought to get over now," Longstaffe said excitedly, "we're
right on their line."</p>

<p>Johanson felt, as he had felt so often before in his life,
that surge of vitality that almost forbade him to stand where he
was.</p>

<p>As he stared at the straining backs and thighs of the pushing,
struggling scrums he wanted to rush into the field and shove too.
Several boys and young men were running up to the far end of the
field to see better what was occurring, and his impulse was to
run with them. But he held on to the ropes, leaning forward, the
men on either side of him yelling, "Shove them over! Shove the
b--s over! You've got them! You've got them, by G--!"</p>

<p>But the South had not got them. The Northern back ran in and
relieved by a long kick into touch, and the men came streaming
down the field.</p>

<p>As the players came towards mid-field Johanson noticed in the
Northern team one of the three-quarters--the merest boy--and
suddenly he was deeply sympathetic to him. He looked younger and
slighter than any other man on the ground, and in his face was a
look of eager, almost bitter, determination which Johanson
understood exactly.</p>

<p>This was perhaps his first important game, it meant almost
everything to him, and so far not a chance had come his way. It
might be that he had been put into the team at the last moment as
a substitute and was being watched and criticised by the men
behind the rope and knew that it was so. He was outside wing on
the far side of the field and the ball <i>would</i> not come his
way. Then suddenly it was swinging in his direction. The inside
wing, getting it, seemed to hesitate as to whether he would go on
himself, then, a Southern three-quarter coming for him, at the
last moment, before he fell, slung it out to the boy.</p>

<p>The young fellow was off. He had slipped his opposing "three"
and now had a clear course, running like slipping water, just
inside the touch line. Oh, he could run! And Johanson was glad.
Five minutes before he had been shouting for the Southerners, but
now, although it was a Northern three-quarter who had the ball,
once again, crimson in the face, he was shouting, "Well done!
Bravo! Splendid! Splendid!"</p>

<p>The Southern full-back was after him, made a dash for his
knees, missed them, went sprawling. The boy was over and,
unopposed, touched the ball down between the posts.</p>

<p>There was a roar from the Northern supporters. Johanson roared
too.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a nice one," said Longstaffe. "You're a
Southerner. What are you shouting North for?"</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," said Johanson, "I couldn't help it. He
wanted his chance and he <i>could</i> run. Oh, he could! Bravo!
Bravo!"</p>

<p>The kick for goal failed: the game went on for a while in the
middle of the field, the whistle blew and it was half-time. The
teams moved about sucking lemons, lying on their backs, kicking
the lemon-peel. . . .</p>

<p>There was a hush, and the sun, and the pale sky, and a March
wind blowing across the ground suddenly seemed to enter the field
like new spectators.</p>

<p>Longstaffe put his hand through Johanson's arm:</p>

<p>"Enjoying yourself?"</p>

<p>"Should just think so."</p>

<p>"That's right. We'll come to lots more games together. I am
glad you've come to this town. It's not that I've been lonely
exactly these last years. Oh, well I have, if you want to know.
It's strange, but I can talk to you more easily than to most of
my own countrymen."</p>

<p>"Yes. I can to you."</p>

<p>"It's as though we had known one another all our lives."</p>

<p>Johanson pressed Longstaffe's arm. "We'll stick together
always--just like this. It don't matter <i>what</i> shall happen.
I have always thought it should be the finest thing in the whole
world to have a man friend whom nothing can alter. Love--that is
something different. It comes--it goes. Now it is up, now it is
down. But friendship is a steady thing. It is always there. You
must not for ever be looking to see whether it grows or dies. I
have never had a real man friend before."</p>

<p>It seemed to him as he looked across the field that everything
had suddenly been given to him. Home, ambition, work,
friendship--and love? At that he caught his breath. The figures,
taking their places for the second half, were blurred. Was that
the true reason for all his happiness to-day? Was he at last,
after all these years, in love? He saw the girl moving before him
with that tantalising glance, that eye suddenly soft and
appealing, the yellow hair. . . . His happiness was suddenly
confused. He did not know that he wanted to be in love. Work and
friendship, those were straightforward things that he understood.
But this--there was some hint of danger in it. It seemed suddenly
to thicken the pure austerity of the work that he had before him.
But could he deny it? If it came to him, could he refuse it? And
why should he? Would not a home and children be the best thing
for him?</p>

<p>His happiness was changed. His eyes were no longer on the
game. He did not notice that, as is the way with March weather, a
little wind had come up and with it a flurry of thin rain driving
in thin silver lines about the field. A cloud reached out and
caught the sun. Men, on every side were turning up their coat
collars.</p>

<p>He realised that some one was speaking to Longstaffe, and,
turning, saw that it was that stout, red-faced fellow who had
come in on that first evening at Mrs. Penethen's. He was smiling.
He stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Johnson. You won't remember me. We met some
weeks ago. Seen you about the streets occasionally."</p>

<p>"How do you do?" Johanson shook his hand, which was soft and
warm.</p>

<p>"Fine game!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"Ever seen our Rugby before?"</p>

<p>"No, never."</p>

<p>"Ah! must be interesting for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear you're doing so well. Must come in one day and
'ave some exercises. Take down some of my fat."</p>

<p>Johanson said nothing. The man nodded and moved on.</p>

<p>Johanson said to Longstaffe, "That man came into Mrs.
Penethen's the first night I arrived. What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Hogg--Samuel Hogg."</p>

<p>"I don't like him."</p>

<p>Longstaffe dropped his voice. "No, he's a bad lot. Was a
publican once. Now he owns most of the Polchester slums. He's
behind most of the rotten things in the town. He's a bad
hat."</p>

<p>"He's a friend of a man at Mrs. Penethen's who helped me about
getting my rooms."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," Longstaffe said. "Have as little to
do with him as you can."</p>

<p>They turned back to the game. The misty rain made it difficult
to see. There was no more scoring, however, and just as the
whistle blew for "time" the storm drove across the field in
torrents.</p>

<h1><a name="c106">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>

<h1>THE SISTERS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Maude Penethen had known ever since she was conscious of
anything at all that she was beautiful to look upon. Almost as
swiftly had come the further discovery that others were, for the
most part, ugly, or if not ugly, plain, undistinguished.</p>

<p>She had WONDERFUL HAIR--gold, auburn, butter-cups, sunset,
amber, but for the most part GOLDEN--"liquid gold" an old fat
friend of her mother's had once called it, running the strands
through his podgy fingers when she was quite a little girl.</p>

<p>This hair, this delicate, slight body, these tiny hands and
feet, these red lips and large "laughing eyes"--that also from
the little podgy man--she realised, very early indeed, that these
were the things that she had, and that because of these people
would pay her more attention than they did to other girls.</p>

<p>She naturally centred in more and more upon herself.</p>

<p>As she grew she became, in certain directions, frank about
herself. She knew that she was not what people called
"clever"--that is, not clever at books and sums and things like
geography and history. But she could see, very quickly indeed,
what people were after, especially boys--and then, in a year or
two, especially men. She could hold her own with any man. She
knew, or thought that she knew, from a very early time everything
about "Love." As a matter of honest record she knew nothing about
"Love" at all.</p>

<p>She was vain, violent-tempered and selfish, but with those
things went a most attaching streak of na&iuml;vet&eacute;,
simplicity, purity. She never listened to the other girls when
they whispered stories to one another at the High School. Just as
she would spend hours, were she permitted, in attending to her
body, washing it, beautifying it in every way that she knew, so
also she kept her mind clean. She fussed about her bedroom seeing
that it was spotlessly neat. Her linen, a tremendous
preoccupation with her, was bright and fresh like clear
water.</p>

<p>Her violent temper was considered by herself rather an asset.
She could "turn it on" when it would be useful to her. She was
afraid of one person in the world--her mother--but only of one.
Upon her mother her tempers had no effect whatever.</p>

<p>With the mind and vision of a grown woman she knew that she
was beautiful and that men would always desire her. Behind that
knowledge was the heart and ignorance of a little child. She
thought that she was astonishingly unusual. She saw no one in her
world in the least like her. They said in the town that young
Lady St. Leath was beautiful. Maude liked to look at Lady St.
Leath, and then indulge in one of her triumphant exultations.
That girl, riding in her carriage, opening a bazaar, walking with
her husband--that girl with the simple face and the simple
clothes and the timid smile--she might have her castle and her
fat husband, her old cockatoo of a mother-in-law and her little
baby boy--have them and welcome--she couldn't hold a candle to
Maude Penethen!</p>

<p>And in her heart Maude knew that Lady St. Leath had something
that she had not but would adore to have!</p>

<p>Sometimes, after she had gone up to bed, she would strip and
sit naked on her bed looking out at the moon, and let her
red-gold hair down and dip her shoulders luxuriously into it,
putting her hands round the small firm cups of her breasts, and
so sit, hunched up, breathing with deep luxurious pleasure,
staring through the window, then glancing down at her tiny feet,
then through the window again as though she were inviting some
one to come in.</p>

<p>And once in his calm, unblinking fashion Reuben Fletch had
placed his arm round her waist and tried to kiss her. How she had
slapped his cheeks! Her rage! How terrible! How magnificent! And
Reuben Fletch had seemed to like her anger.</p>

<p>She had a plain sister. She had never <i>quite</i> accustomed
herself to Judy's plainness. And there was something more than
that--the fact that Judy seemed to be proud of her plainness. Had
she, Maude, been as plain as Judy she would not have known how to
lift her head in company. But Judy had a pride, the sort of pride
that baffled Maude just as something in Lady St. Leath baffled
her. She could not understand why people who should surely have
baffled her much more--old Canon Ronder, for instance, and Reuben
Fletch and Samuel Hogg, did not baffle her at all, whereas Judy
and Lady St. Leath had something . . .</p>

<p>She did not know Judy's feelings towards her. She herself did
not dislike Judy. She pitied her. And she was honest enough not
to pretend to herself that Judy was jealous of her. No, with all
her plainness, Judy envied no one in the world. She wanted to be
only herself.</p>

<p>And Maude was more honest than that. She knew that she was
selfish and that Judy, were her affection moved, was not. She,
Maude, gloried in her selfishness. She didn't care. She wanted to
live--to have Everything! As Reuben Fletch in his room upstairs
was greedy of money, so was she greedy of life and success and
admiration.</p>

<p>She wanted to be the first in this house, and then the first
in the town, and then the first in England, and then--the first
in the world. Well, why not? Was there any one like her anywhere?
Any one so lovely?</p>

<p>She stood up naked before her glass, her hands rippling
through her hair, seeing the faint thin shadows lie, as though
they were painted, under her breasts, on her thighs.</p>

<p>She sighed. She laughed. Yes, she was lovely. And the Swede,
the Dane, whatever he was, the child, the simpleton, was in love
with her.</p>

<p>She thought of that. Saw him standing above her, around her.
She saw herself, a little ball. He picked her up with his great
arms and held her close to his breast. She shivered with delight.
At least she would be engaged to him. Just to annoy Judy. Just to
feel his lips upon hers. Just to see that childish look of wonder
lighten his eyes. To know that she could do that--do that with
any man!</p>

<p>But marriage? She began to put on her clothes. Well, marriage
was a long way off.</p>

<p>She was downstairs in the big kitchen-living-room, alone in
the house. She was sitting in the old rocking-chair, creaking
backwards and forwards, reading the serial story in <i>The Golden
Penny.</i> The round, moon-faced clock clattered the hour--four
o'clock. There was a knock on the door. She went across, opened
it and looked into the darkening street. An old woman stood
there.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Maude.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't this Mrs. Penethen's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. But she's out."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wanted to speak to a Mr. Johnson, a foreign gentleman,
who lodges here."</p>

<p>"Yes, he does. But he's out too."</p>

<p>"Oh . . . Oh yes. Thank you, I'm sure. I wonder if I might
leave a message for him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Won't you come in? It's growing dark outside."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, I will."</p>

<p>Maude was nice to every one until she had conquered them and
won them to her side. Then she didn't care. She knew at once who
this old woman was when she saw her standing there under the
light of the kitchen lamp. It was poor old Miss Eldred.</p>

<p><i>Poor</i> Miss Eldred. As Maude emphasised to herself that
happy adjective she felt an increased tenderness for her visitor.
Seen there under the mellow light of the lamp she was indeed a
poor old creature with her black bonnet and its faded strings,
her crinkled, anxious pink face, her worn black mantle, her thin
black cotton gloves. Some wisps of grey hair straggled untidily
beneath the bonnet. At the tip of her pinched, inquisitive nose
was a dew-drop of emotion. She had the faded air of a print
exposed too long to every kind of weather. She was mottled and
anxious and obsequious.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Miss Penethen, it is too, too good of you to have
me in like this. And your time so valuable too, I'm sure. It is
merely--if I might entrust a message--if I am not too--"</p>

<p>She came to a sudden pause as though her agitation--which she
had been expressing with every kind of movement of the gloved
hands, pushing them now at her throat, now at her watery eyes,
now to cover her thin and hard lips--was too strong for her.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear," she murmured at last, gazing about the
room with an eye that was both despairing and inquisitive. "I
<i>know</i> that I'm taking up your time--"</p>

<p>"Of course you're not," said Maude, gazing on her with
kindness. The poor old thing! And to think that when Maude had
been a little girl Miss Eldred had been a Power. Well, if not
exactly a Power, at any rate some one held up to admiration with
her class for Modelling in Wax, her "Bead-work" Courses and her
"Talks on British Painters." Why had it all come so suddenly to
an end? Maude did not know. She did not greatly care. And
suddenly her patience was over. She wished to return to her
<i>Golden Penny.</i> Her eyes hardened. Miss Eldred perceived it.
She was suddenly quite brisk.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Miss Penethen. It is only that your lodger, Mr.
Johnson, expressed a wish to a friend of mine that he might meet
me. It seems that he is interested in the Arts. He heard that
there we had a common bond. . . . Quite, quite. I thought that I
would leave my address--and a word to say that if I can be, in my
poor, humble way, of any use--"</p>

<p>She pressed a soiled card into Maude's hand and turned to the
door.</p>

<p>Her voice was suddenly sharp and acid:</p>

<p>"You won't forget to give it to him, I beg?"</p>

<p>"No," said Maude, startled at the new tone.</p>

<p>"Good night, then," and the old figure was gone.</p>

<p>The clock ticked on, the coal slipped and stuttered in the
grate and Maude read on. The serial story, "A Princess of
Vascovy," was exciting, the pictures enchanting, but--but--</p>

<p>What was he about to have an old wretch like that in his
company? What could that old thing do for him but make him
ridiculous? What kind of a man must he be to seem so simple about
other people? The paper slipped to the floor. The man rose in
front of her, standing with his stature and strength between her
and the fire, and as she gazed at her picture of him there rose
in her breast a strange mingling of pity and contempt--contempt
that he, so mature and so strong, could be such a fool, pity
because he needed some one to look after him, to advise him. She
jumped up and began to move about the room and soon, as they so
often did, her steps turned into a dancing measure. She was
turning, twisting, twirling, turning . . .</p>

<p>The street door opened. Some one paused to hang up a coat.
Maude turned expectant, then sighed--it was only Judy!</p>

<p>Judy was the last person she wanted just then. But Judy was
always the last person she wanted. She wondered--as she had so
often wondered before--how Judy could be her sister! That
straight, thin creature, like a stick, without a curve in her, so
black and so frowning and disapproving! Judy disapproved of
everything she did, of everything she said, of everything that
she thought! Well, so much the worse for Judy, then--stupid,
stuck-up thing! <i>She</i> didn't care! Let her disapprove! And
yet well she knew how pleasant it would be to win Judy's
approval, to win it only for a moment and then to show her how
little she cared whether she had it or no!</p>

<p>Judy, as was her custom, said nothing. She came forward, bent
upon the fire her dark, far-seeing eyes, then quietly sat down on
a little stiff-backed chair. And, as had happened on many
thousand occasions before, Maude was irritated by her silence,
was uncomfortable indeed at anybody's silence, fearing it as
something dangerous and threatening.</p>

<p>"Old Miss Eldred's been here," she said half truculently, half
expectantly.</p>

<p>Judy said nothing.</p>

<p>"She was asking for Mr. Johnson." Judy slowly raised her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson? What did she want with him?"</p>

<p>Maude continued to dance, moving in and out, up and down
across the old floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. He wanted to see her."</p>

<p>"To see her? To see Miss Eldred?"</p>

<p>"Yes. . . . You heard, stupid."</p>

<p>"To see Miss Eldred? Mr. Johnson?"</p>

<p>Maude stopped and came over to the fire. "Yes. . . . Oh
please, Miss Penethen. . . ." She imitated Miss Eldred's
obsequious voice and nervous movements. "I know I'm taking up
your time, but that nice Mr. Johnson--"</p>

<p>"She didn't say that nice Mr. Johnson," Judy interrupted
indignantly.</p>

<p>"All right, have it your own way. I ought to know, oughtn't
I?" Continuing Miss Eldred: "He wants some one to help him make
Polchester beautiful, and he's asked me to help him, and here I
am--"</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," Judy answered. "Why, Miss
Eldred's awful! She drinks and steals and does everything
dreadful."</p>

<p>"The man's a simpleton," said Maude. "That's the truth about
Mr. Harmer John. He's been having old Benjie Shortt in his
office. He's going to give him work to do and pay him a regular
salary. He's potty."</p>

<p>"How dare you," Judy flared up. "What do you know about it?
You're the laziest and most ignorant girl in Polchester. What do
you know about his reasons or his work or anything else? If he
thinks Mr. Shortt can help him he probably can. It's just his
kindness, anyway."</p>

<p>Maude's beautiful eyes gleamed with malicious pleasure.</p>

<p>"So that's it, is it?" she said, laughing. "You're in love
with him, are you, like Miss Midgeley and mother? Like every one
in this house except Mr. Fletch and myself."</p>

<p>Judy sprang up.</p>

<p>"Now, don't you say that, Maude Penethen. You're always making
mischief wherever you can. I'm not in love with any man, I hate
them all."</p>

<p>"Well, you're jealous of me, then. You know you are. You know
he's in love with me and has been from the first moment he set
eyes on me. And you hate me having any fun. You always do and you
always have."</p>

<p>"He's too good for you," Judy answered fiercely, "a thousand
times too good for you. You're playing with him as you've played
with lots of others. When you're tired of it you'll just break
his heart, and it's a shame, a wicked shame!"</p>

<p>Maude did not resent this. She took it as a tribute.</p>

<p>"How do you know it's just like the others?" she said slowly.
"Perhaps it isn't. <i>He</i> isn't like the others. Not a bit
like any one else. Maybe you're wrong this time, Miss Know-All.
You're not always right, with all your cleverness."</p>

<p>"I know this, anyway," said Judy, "that there couldn't be
anything more unhappy for him in the world than his marrying you.
He isn't your sort. He doesn't begin to understand a girl like
you. He <i>is</i> simple in a kind of a way. He hasn't met many
women, I should think--not <i>really</i> met them. Oh, leave him
alone, Maude! You wouldn't be happy if you <i>were</i> married to
him! He would take it so seriously. And you couldn't be faithful
to any one, not if you tried ever so!"</p>

<p>"Oh, couldn't I?" Maude began to dance again. "You know an
awful lot, don't you? But I tell you this," she came dancing
round until she stood over her sister: "If you try and interfere
with me in this, I--I--I'll pull your hair out! And you haven't
such a lot that you can afford to miss any."</p>

<p>Their mother came in. Mrs. Penethen, although she was only a
daughter of a small Glebeshire farmer, had a very fine air. She
had got it, perhaps, from the Castle, where she had been, as a
girl, under-housemaid. Or she had it from one of those old
Glebeshire raiders who had been kings in their day. Or she had
got it . . . but never mind. She had it. She was a distinguished
woman, and "what I like about Mrs. Penethen," Mrs. Sampson, the
Dean's wife, had said, "is that she always keeps her place." In
1907 in Polchester it was still important that places should be
kept.</p>

<p>Never mind. Mrs. Penethen was passive about this, as she was
about everything else. Every mother must learn passivity, must
develop that internal security and peace whence no eccentricity
or selfishness of husband or children can drive them.</p>

<p>Years of married life with her John had begun to teach her,
years of motherhood of Maude and Judy had completed the lesson.
She was serene whatever occurred, the serenest woman in
Polchester. To her boarders, her children, her friends, to them
all alike she was, if not indifferent (that would imply a cold
heart, and she had a warm one), remote. She lived her own secret
life.</p>

<p>But, just at this time, for the first occasion for many a
while, her remoteness was threatened. It was threatened because
of her feeling for her lodger, Mr. Johnson. She had never
recovered from that strange sense of intimacy with which she had
recognised him on that evening of his sudden arrival, and that
intimacy was the stranger because she never liked foreigners; but
he had not been a foreigner, in spite of his accent, his broken
English and the rest.</p>

<p>He was almost like a son of her own; he drew from her the
maternal, and the maternal was the strongest passion in her. She
had been maternal to her John in spite of, perchance because of,
his many infidelities, and she would have been maternal to Maude
and Judy had they allowed her. They had not allowed her, and
therefore she had taken refuge in her own dignified serenity.</p>

<p>But now once again, after so many years, there was some one
who needed her. And he was in love with her Maude. It was this
that threatened her serenity, because she was not sure of Maude.
She was not sure, although she was her own mother, whether the
girl were good or bad. Not all good, of course, nor all bad. She
knew the girl's faults, her vanity, her selfishness, her
obstinacy, her bad temper, but she knew also something childlike
and touching that was there, something innocent and wondering and
na&iuml;ve.</p>

<p>A real love, a true love, might be the making of the girl, but
did she care for him? Was it only vanity or his strangeness that
touched her? And meanwhile if he, Harmer John, as the whole town
now called him, was to be hurt and wounded by her own child, she
would never forgive herself. No, she would never forgive
herself.</p>

<p>As she came into the kitchen she looked at her two daughters
and saw that they had been quarrelling again. They were always
quarrelling. She stood before the fire warming her thin hands and
gazing into the crimson glow very much as Judy had done a little
while before.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," Maude burst out, "who do you think has been
here? That old Miss Eldred. And what do you think she wanted? To
see Mr. Johnson. To help him in his Art, if you please. She said
he wanted her to help him. What can he be thinking of?"</p>

<p>"More than you understand, I've no doubt, dear," said Mrs.
Penethen.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I don't understand anything," said Maude,
tossing her head, "<i>I</i> never do," and wondering for the
thousandth time, as many a girl before her has wondered and many
a time since, why they were all so stupid in her family (yes, and
old Miss Midgeley too) not to see how charming and amusing and
attractive she was, a fact most patent to all the outside
world.</p>

<p>"You don't understand much, and that's a fact," said Mrs.
Penethen placidly, "and I won't have you going about with Samuel
Hogg. For one thing, he's nearly old enough to be your
grandfather, and for another he's no gentleman."</p>

<p>"I don't go about with him," said Maude, suddenly sulking. "If
he speaks to me, I can't prevent him, can I?"</p>

<p>"Now, I mean this, Maude. You've got no father, and I'm the
only one to look after you. You know he's a bad man, and all the
town knows it, so that's enough."</p>

<p>"Who says I go about with him?"</p>

<p>"Never mind who. It's a fact and I've told you. He's not
coming inside this house again if I know it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like him," said Maude with one of those sudden
submissions of hers that were so charming, "so you needn't bother
your head, mother."</p>

<p>"That's a good girl," said Mrs. Penethen.</p>

<p>Upon the tranquil scene there suddenly ventured Miss Midgeley,
coming in, as she always did, with a sarcastic expression on her
twisted countenance. Miss Midgeley was a lady, a lady born and a
lady bred, and all the Penethens were aware of that. Mrs.
Penethen and Judy liked her, liked her both because she was a
lady and because she was sarcastic, and those were precisely the
reasons why Maude disliked her but wished to be liked <i>by</i>
her.</p>

<p>Miss Midgeley was carrying various small parcels and was
looking rather pleased with herself. She dressed mannishly, a
brown waistcoat with brass buttons, a hard white collar and a
short brown skirt. Her iron-grey hair was brushed back sharply
under her hat. Her little puckered face, strawberry colour, was
alert and cynical.</p>

<p>She leaned on the table and looked at the three women.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "now you'll ask me where I've been and what
I've been doing, and I'll tell you. I've been shopping and
talking to Society. You'll ask, 'What Society?' and I'll reply,
'The very best.' None other than our dear Mrs. Bond, who met me
in the High Street and said, 'Why, Miss Midgeley, what an age it
is since we've met!' Smiling so sweetly too, and I said, 'Yes';
and she said, 'Working at anything just now?' and I said, 'Yes';
and she said, 'One of your delightful girl stories, I suppose?'
and I said, 'Yes,' and she said, 'I do so wonder how you can
write. It <i>must</i> be so difficult. I remember once I met
Olive Schreiner in South Africa and said the same thing to her.'
I said, 'Yes' again, and here I am just as though nothing had
happened!"</p>

<p>Maude never knew how to take Miss Midgeley when she talked in
this fashion. Had she met Mrs. Bond in the High Street and Mrs.
Bond had stopped and spoken to her, she would have alluded to it
carelessly afterwards as though she didn't care in the least, but
Miss Midgeley really seemed <i>not</i> to care! Maude would have
cared very much.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like that Mrs. Bond," said Mrs. Penethen. "She
talks too much and says things about people she shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," said Miss Midgeley suddenly, "she had
something else to say to me. She understood that this gymnastic
instructor Mr.--what was his name?--was living in the same house
as myself. She had heard that he was a delightful man--what was
my opinion? Well, my opinion was not for her basket, and so I
just said 'Yes' again and left her staring; but you'll all be
glad to hear that she's sending both her younger boys to his
gymnasium class, so our Mr. Johnson is in luck."</p>

<p>She paused, raised her head sharply, whistled a few notes of a
little tune (a favourite habit of hers) and said:</p>

<p>"Judy, suppose you come up to my room a minute and arrange
these odds and ends--and very odds and ends they are, too. I've
got some flowers here that want water."</p>

<p>"She never asks me to her room," said Maude discontentedly, as
she watched them vanish through the door, "and I'm much more
amusing than Judy."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's why," said Mrs. Penethen placidly.</p>

<p>Maude suddenly burst out, "Mother, I'm sick of this! I'm going
to find some work and get away from this town."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said her mother, "what kind of work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anything! All sorts of girls are working nowadays--nobody
stays at home any more."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. But what direction exactly were you thinking
of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. There are lots of things. I know you think
I can't do anything. You all do in this house. You and Miss
Midgeley and Judy. And Judy's jealous because Mr. Johnson's in
love with me."</p>

<p>For once Mrs. Penethen was indignant. "I just won't have you
saying that, Maude. For one thing, it isn't true, and then it's a
nasty thought to have of your sister. You don't seem to have any
natural feelings."</p>

<p>"Well, she is, then," retorted Maude. "You should have seen
her flare up just now when I said he was a fool to have people
like old Shortt and Miss Eldred round. And so he <i>is</i> a
fool. I'd tell him to his face."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen put out her hand and drew Maude towards her. The
girl came reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Be more loving, Maude. Don't be hating everybody so. Hating
never did any one any good that I ever heard of. Yes, wriggle
away from your old mother. She won't try to keep you. I've learnt
my lesson. You can't keep any one in this world if they don't
want to stay--no, not though you break your heart trying. But
your mother's your friend--the best friend you'll ever have,
maybe. I seem dried-up and old, but I've had my tempers in my
time and have got 'em still, if all were known; but life's so
short and men so everlastingly childish that it isn't worth
fashing yourself. You're pretty, Maude, and men will run after
your body from all sides of the town, but a good man will ask
questions about your soul, and that's the only way you'll hold
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, the soul!" Maude broke in impatiently. She had been
standing close at her mother's side, her head cocked a little
like a bird on the alarm. "That's all right, mother, when you're
old, but I'm young and I want to have some fun. I know I'm the
prettiest girl in the town, and every one else knows it. I won't
be pretty always. I know that. No one ever is. And I want to
dance, and have men look at me as though they could eat me, and
then tell them I don't like them. I'm all right, mother. I can
look after myself. There isn't a man in the place can touch me if
I don't want him to."</p>

<p>"Well, that's bad talk, Maude," Mrs. Penethen answered,
"that's what it is. You and your prettiness! So you <i>are</i>
pretty in a sort of way, but you haven't done half for yourself
that you might have done. When have you ever learnt anything?
Haven't I tried again and again to get you to make yourself
useful? What man will want to marry you when he knows you can't
cook nor sew nor look after a house to keep it clean and decent?
And the way you talk as though any man who saw you would fall at
your feet! There's many of them would think you too stupid to
spend five minutes with. No, if a good man comes along and likes
you, think yourself lucky and take your chance. And consider
others a little--Selfish! Why, I never met such selfishness!"</p>

<p>Maude was so often unexpected. Now she smiled, bent down and
kissed her mother's cheek.</p>

<p>"Mother, dear, I know who you're thinking of. He does like me,
doesn't he? And I like him. He's so strong and he's such a baby.
I can do anything with him--<i>anything.</i> And he's going to
have a good position here, too. Every one likes him. He goes to
Canon Ronder's house three times a week to bring his fat down. Do
you think he'll ask me to marry him, mother?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen looked past her daughter into space.</p>

<p>"If he does," she said slowly, "and you accept him, it will be
more than you deserve, Maude Penethen. And if after that you
treat him badly, don't look to me for sympathy. I would never
forgive you."</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened, and the man of whom they were
speaking came in.</p>

<p>The thing that Mrs. Penethen noticed about him now--and it was
the first thing always that she noticed about him--was his
cleanliness. No men with whom she had been concerned--not her
husband nor his friends nor the men about the house, not Fletch
nor, if you carried it farther, any of the townsmen of the place,
had <i>his</i> kind of cleanliness! Of course the
gentry--Bentinck-Major, Ronder, Ryle and <i>their</i> world--with
them you expected a superior neatness, although some of them were
shabby enough. But with Harmer John--she had fallen, as they all
had, into the town's diminutive--it was something much more than
neatness--he wasn't neat at all--something more than cleanliness
even: a radiant physical health that came from his contentment of
mind as well as from fitness of body.</p>

<p>He hung up his hat and his coat, then came across to them,
ruffling his hand through his hair. He stood over them, looking
down upon them, his legs wide. But it was not true that he was
looking down upon them; he was staring at Maude as though he saw
her for the first time.</p>

<p>She, looking up at him, was aware, as though she had slipped
from one room into another, of a new experience. Was it love? She
had never felt like this before. Call it rather physical
consciousness. She was aware, as she had never been, of his black
rumpled hair, his blue eyes, his round face crooked a little
because he was smiling, his immense breadth, rocking himself so
slightly on his heels. She had a consciousness that his arms were
moving out towards her (although she knew that they stayed
motionless at his side), and for the very first time in her life
she was confused, tranced in a hot mist of arrested feeling, so
that her heart was not beating, her eyes not stirring and she
could think of nothing--only of those advancing arms that yet did
not advance.</p>

<p>It seemed to be long after that she moved her head and saw
that her mother had left them and was attending to something in a
cupboard at a far part of the room.</p>

<p>Their conversation then was absurd, meaningless, a scattering
out on the floor of little coloured counters, nothing in
themselves, but standing for a game of great import.</p>

<p>"Well, how's to-day been? Any new customers?"</p>

<p>"Yes . . . and I've been to Ronder's and given him a rub."</p>

<p>"Is he nice when you're rubbing him?"</p>

<p>"Yes--if he wouldn't be I could soon make him. He don't like
to be hurt, that's certain. But he's a kind gentleman, speaking
well of everybody."</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect he's all right. And what else have you done
to-day?"</p>

<p>"I don't hope it could interest you telling you all about the
class from the Boys' School, Miss Maude. But they'll be fine all
the same when I've finished with them."</p>

<p>"Do you like boys better to drill, or men--or girls,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's much in a muchness. What I want is work, don't you
see. Oh! I can't have too much of it . . . work . . . and love .
. . only love . . ." His voice dropped. He was standing very
close to her. She had sat down in the chair that her mother had
vacated.</p>

<p>She had not heard anything that he had said. She felt his body
above her; it was standing, it seemed to her, on every side of
her. His eyes--so childlike and simple and
unquestioning--embraced her. It was as though already he had held
her in his arms, although in reality he had not touched her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "go on, Mr. Johnson, it is so
interesting."</p>

<p>"And so--and so--" he went on. But his voice broke. He could
say nothing. His hand moved and touched the arm of the chair and
the sleeve of her dress. "Now I must go--I must go--"</p>

<p>She said nothing. The kitchen was silent save for the ticking
of the old round-faced clock. Mrs. Penethen was sitting at the
table working at something in a black book.</p>

<p>"I must go--I must go--" She touched his hand lightly for a
moment with hers. Then she sprang from her chair.</p>

<p>He moved carefully, as though he feared lest with an awkward
movement he should break something, out to the stairs that led up
to his room.</p>

<h1><a name="c107">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>

<h1>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Although the year 1907 is not, as years go, so very distant,
yet immense differences of thought and of actual living separate
it from the life of our own day. One great difference--in our
English country towns at any rate--is that we still in those
pre-war years found much of our entertainment under the shadow of
our own roof, beside the warmth of our own hearthstone. For the
Polcastrian at any rate the cinema was not, the theatre
<i>almost</i> was not, the circus twice a year only, the ball
likewise. But in our own homes we had our own fun. It would seem
simple enough, that fun, I have no doubt, to the dancers and
theatre-goers of 1926, just as the dancers of 1926 will show a
kind of barnyard air to the chickens of 1970, but happiness is
happiness wherever and whenever it may come--and perhaps the
simpler pleasures are, the happier they are. I don't know; I
merely offer it as a possible suggestion.</p>

<p>In any case the Penethen kitchen was famous for its
festivities. From the very earliest days of the Penethen married
life parties--rollicking, rolling, riotous parties--had been
given there, and even when Mr. Penethen had been at his most
unfaithful, and the family coffer most nearly bankrupt, the
parties had continued, nor had any observer detected at the heart
of their splendour fainter fires.</p>

<p>For they <i>were</i> splendid, and they were splendid because
Mrs. Penethen intended them to be so. Dry, austere, ironic as she
might appear, at her heart she adored a party. Nothing pleased
her more than to be asked to one--save in truth to give one
herself.</p>

<p>She had the gift for a party. She knew precisely the
ingredients of one. She could <i>bake</i> a party with the
best--a little salt here, a little sugar there, so many raisins,
some ginger and candied peel. . . . She had the lightest hand for
a party in the four kingdoms. Christmas, Easter, and Maude's and
Judy's birthdays, these were the occasions--and an out-of-doors
picnic in the summer. She never invited too many guests. A dozen
was enough for that kitchen. She knew her mind and held to it,
and no agonised appeals on Maude's part to add one, two or three
could change her.</p>

<p>"But it's <i>my</i> party, mother. It's <i>my</i>
birthday."</p>

<p>"So it is, child."</p>

<p>"Then why can't I . . ."</p>

<p>And this year there was no begging for additions. Maude seemed
satisfied. And every one knew why.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Maude was in time for breakfast <i>this</i> morning. Oh yes,
certainly. And she timed her arrival with a charming appropriate
gesture--every one there save Reuben Fletch, but <i>only</i> just
there, still gazing at the breakfast table and wondering whether
it was eggs and bacon or sausages.</p>

<p>A moment later--just behind her in fact--Harmer John arrived
on his way, as usual, to his office. He was carrying a pot of
flowers in his hand. Wrapped in tissue paper. Maude, with a cry
of delight, tore off the paper before looking at the other things
on her plate. Very early daffodils.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Mr. Johnson. Aren't they sweet?" But she was
disappointed. She had expected that he would give her something
better than mere flowers. He did not know that. He was blushing
and staring straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Many happy birthdays!" he said. "I don't hope that you'll
grow old--ever!" Which was so odd that they all laughed and while
they were laughing he was gone.</p>

<p>There followed for Maude a slight sense of reaction. She had
thought that he would stay "just this once." Not as though she
had a birthday every day. Always his silly old business. What did
ten minutes matter? And flowers? After all any one could give her
flowers, and with all his talk of beautiful things. . . .</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was her intention to-day to be charming, and
in a moment charming she was. It was not difficult. She loved to
be given presents, she <i>adored</i> to be liked, to be the
centre of attraction, to make people around her happy if to do so
was easy, and did not make herself unhappy, and here they were,
even Judy and Miss Midgeley looking at her kindly without that
nasty "I-know-your-game" look in their eyes.</p>

<p>Herself looked bewitching. She knew that she did. She was
never prettier than when she was in her simplest dress, to-day a
pale blue frock, and an airy gentle poise about her as though at
an instant she might be off through the window dancing through
the light spring-whispering March air.</p>

<p>Her mother gave her a bead necklace, Judy a pair of gloves,
old Midgeley some handkerchiefs. Fletch gave her nothing, of
course. He had never been known to give anybody anything, but so
gentle was his air, so amiable his smile as he wished her "Many
happy returns," that it was as good as a present. And then the
street bell rang. She danced herself to the door. A boy with a
parcel. She was back among them, her face alight with excitement.
What could it be? Something unusual. A box? No. A cage! And in
the cage a nightingale. A card tied to the cage: "For Miss Maude
Penethen, with the respectful compliments of Samuel Hogg."</p>

<p>"Samuel Hogg! But how did he know? How--?"</p>

<p>Her mother's voice interrupted her. "You must send it back. I
won't have you taking presents from that man."</p>

<p>Her face clouded. Such a pretty cage! With gilt bars. And the
nightingale was singing already.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen saw the frowning face. After all it was the
child's birthday. Afterwards. . . . To-morrow. . . .</p>

<p>"Well, Maude, leave it. Only you've got to make it plain to
him he's not to be giving you presents."</p>

<p>"Why, it's the first thing he's ever given me! And after all
it'll be Judy's as much as mine."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Judy, "I'll have the looking after it. If it were
left to you it would be dead in a day." Already she had gone to
the cage and was talking to the bird. She loved animals
passionately. The fox-terrier, Caesar, was hers. Maude hated
dogs--rough messy things. But she liked cats--when they purred
and nestled in your arms.</p>

<p>So every one was happy, and they settled down to the merriest
breakfast ever.</p>

<p>Later there was peace in the kitchen. Only Mrs. Penethen was
there, seated at the table peeling potatoes. They were all away
busy about their own affairs, Fletch at his office, Maude
shopping in the town, Judy upstairs doing the rooms, assisted by
Mary-Thomasine, the maid-of-all-work, who was stupid but willing,
Miss Midgeley in <i>her</i> room writing perhaps, reading
perhaps--who knows? A funny old maid with her own ideas. And Mrs.
Penethen as she peeled her potatoes (just as Miss Midgeley
upstairs was peeling her ideas) was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>On the preceding evening Harmer John had spoken to her. They
had been alone in the kitchen and he had sat down beside her and
asked her whether he had her permission to propose marriage to
her daughter. She had heard him out in her silent determined way.
What he had said had been very simple. He loved her daughter,
Maude, with all his heart and soul. He had loved her from the
first moment he had seen her. Of course he was a foreigner and
she might not wish that her daughter should marry a foreigner.
But he was half English, the stronger half of himself, he
thought. He had saved a little money, not much but something. He
was doing very well here. His business was increasing every day.
In the last month he had made a profit. It might become a very
large business, and in any case he was not a boy to lose his head
and be extravagant. He would be faithful to Maude. He was not a
man who ran after women. He did not drink nor gamble.</p>

<p>He was strong and would work for her with every muscle in his
body. He had never loved a woman before. He thought that perhaps
she cared for him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen heard him out and then she said that if Maude
was willing she also was willing, and upon that he turned and had
his arms around her and hugged the breath out of her body. No one
had ever hugged her before. Her husband had never hugged her in
his most loving moments. His way had been different, looking at
her with his brown eyes and his strange pleading smile. But this
man had hugged her as her son might have hugged her had she had
one. Now as she sat there peeling her potatoes the memory of that
embrace touched her heart, so lonely for so long a time, most
deeply. She had tried, after that, to be her sensible self,
telling him that Maude was very young and knew nothing about life
at all; that his position was still uncertain, and that even if
Maude were willing to marry him they must be engaged for a while
and see how everything went.</p>

<p>He agreed to that: it was what he himself would wish. Looking
back, his triumphant unquestioning happiness frightened her. How
little he knew Maude! He thought her an angel! Maude an
angel!</p>

<p>But then love might change Maude, might give her all that at
present she lacked. She sighed over her potatoes. Had she done
right? Right for him, she meant.</p>

<p>It occurred to her as she sat there how strange it was that
all her anxiety should be for <i>him!</i> Here was she, about to
accomplish the thing that had been for years to her a harrowing
and constant anxiety--Maude's engagement to a good man (it had
always been so possible with her looks that she would marry a bad
one), and now it was about the <i>man's</i> happiness that she
was thinking, the man whom, a few weeks ago, she had neither seen
nor considered. And with that she was aware, sharply, of her deep
affection for this man. Affection! Nay, love--love as though he
had been truly her son. It was all the maternal in her that he
had touched. He would appeal chiefly perhaps to rather elderly
lonely women, women who had lost their husbands or sons, or had
better have lost them, women who had longed for children and been
denied, women who had loved and not been loved in return. There
was something simple, trusting and ignorant about him that made
her for ever want to call out to him: "Look out! Take care!
There's danger that way!" Not that the man was a fool or
unpractical--his ability at his job showed that he was not
that--but he did not know enough about people, he trusted them
too readily, he--And with that she was aware with a second stab
of sharpness that it was against her very own girl, Maude, that
she was moving forward now to warn him--"Look out! Take care!
She's not like that! I know her!"</p>

<p>For shame! Her own daughter! A good girl at heart. Love for a
good man was what she needed. This was the very thing. . . . But
as she peeled her potatoes she shook her head and sighed. If any
harm came to him through her daughter! But what harm could come?
He was a man. He could fend for himself. He was a boy too, a
child--and as she thought of that she smiled. And she was in no
kind of way whatever a sentimental woman.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>By seven o'clock that evening everything was ready. The carpet
was up, the old board floor waxed and shining, and the trestles
and boards (a hundred years old at least) in the place of the
familiar table.</p>

<p>It was a chill March evening, the sky palely green beyond the
window at the setting of the sun, little aguish winds creeping
round the Cathedral corners, the few primroses in the lanes above
the town shivering before they slept, but in the great oven the
fire was so hot that the warming-pans, blue plates, the copper
pots and the picture of Queen Victoria receiving news of her
Accession, all smiled in the heat. Down the long table, causing
the sturdy trestles to do their full duty, were the "Eatables."
"Eatables" sanctioned by a strange Penethen tradition that had
persisted now for twenty years at least without the shadow of a
change--a huge Glebeshire-cured ham, two vast veal and ham pies,
two great dishes of Cornish pasties, loaves of bread mountain
high, moons of butter so handsome that the face of the great
Alderney cow stamped upon them was triumphant in its arrogance,
honeycombs dripping with amber sweetness, and Glebeshire cream
with a crust as richly thick as a parchment missal. And this
Gargantuan feast for twelve persons only! Well, there--were
others--Mrs. Penethen made her Feasts the excuse for After-Feast
charities, and the pensioners on her bounty would be calling
to-morrow morning and mornings again after that.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of the drinks because the guests, for the
chief part, would drink--tea! Yes, and tea of no ordinary
quality, so strong and so black that Glebeshire women boasted
that one cup of it would slaughter strangers from "Up-Along" by
the myriad; even "Quality" from the town, though they had lived
in Polchester all their days, had been known to faint before
it.</p>

<p>But there was beer and cider for the men--and a large jug of
water for Fletch, who had never been known to drink anything
else. In the centre of the table--the table-cloth was pink with
large staring red roses marked upon it--was a great brown jug of
Glebeshire pottery, and this was filled with daffodils sent all
the way from the Scillies by a cousin flower-farmer.</p>

<p>The chairs, with thick black arms to them, were a hundred
years old at least, and a "silly old fule" from London had once
offered enough money for them to give both the girls princess's
dowries. His offer had been rejected with mockery and scorn.</p>

<p>The Boultewood family arrived, as it always did when it was
invited anywhere, before the fitting time. Luckily Mrs. Penethen,
in her grey silk and her cameo brooch, was there to receive them,
knowing from olden time "Fanny Boultewood's little ways."</p>

<p>Her affection for Fanny Boultewood was sustained rather by
tradition and the memory of "ancient days" than by heartfelt love
and admiration. Mrs. Boultewood had one overwhelming quality
that, as the years had advanced, had like the lean kine in the
old story eaten up all the others--she was "terrible mean." You
could see it in her spare nervous figure, in her restless
inquisitive eyes that noticed everything and its positive value
in lightning strokes of appraisal. Not a bad woman but a widow,
who, having, while her husband lived, to "make both ends meet,"
and finding, on his death, "that he had ever so much more" than
she had fancied, had continued the paring practice out of habit
and then had made it her only friend. Her only daughter, Aggie
Boultewood, was a silly giggling girl, plain, over-dressed and
coquettish, but an heiress. Many a young man, hoping to make her
wealth his own, had approached, summoned up courage, and then on
further examination of her faded away.</p>

<p>She had indeed been engaged for a whole year to a young farmer
from St. Mary's Moor, but at last, after much suffering from Mrs.
Boultewood's many economies, he had fled.</p>

<p>Young Isaac Boultewood, thin and pallid and liable to
"sweats," was said to be as mean as his mother, but of this no
one was sure because he spoke so seldom and did in general so
little with his young life save to eat and to sleep.</p>

<p>His mother loved him dearly, and sometimes a Homeric struggle
might be observed between her maternal feelings and her habits of
economy. If she was generous to any one it was towards her Isaac.
Finally about Mrs. Boultewood it may be said that she admired
Reuben Fletch beyond any one in the world; his ability to create
shillings out of nothing and then to keep them for ever chained
to his side was the cause of her admiration.</p>

<p>Soon after the Boultewoods arrived Mr. Ben Squires, a stout
jolly roaring widower, half-brother to John Penethen but ten
years younger than he. He kept an excellent haberdashery
establishment--No. 10 High Street--and was known everywhere for
his jolly ways, his genius for billiards and his merry laughing
evasion of all the Polchester young women, who had endeavoured to
marry him and had not yet abandoned hope. He was stout, square
and red-faced; he had lost most of his hair, but all that
remained to him was tended so carefully, watered so frequently
and parted so handsomely that it was still one of his most
engaging features. He was a kindly good-natured creature, with a
great affection for his sister-in-law and his two nieces. On
occasion he drank too freely, and his stories gained what they
lost by their repetition in their energy and air of excitement.
He wore gay waistcoats and laughed at everything.</p>

<p>One of the remaining guests from the outside world was Mr.
Longstaffe, and about him, although she would confess it to
nobody, Mrs. Penethen was anxiously nervous. Of course clergymen
went everywhere and were no respecters of class. Mrs. Penethen
had been to his church on many occasions, and he had always
spoken in the friendliest way to her and her daughters when he
met them in the town, but she would never have ventured to invite
him had it not been for his great friendship with Mr. Johanson.
He was a little different too from the others because of that
story about his daughter. Of course the girl had left the town
years ago, but the affair had made him "less of the quality,"
more like "anybody else." Mrs. Penethen had been divided in her
judgement over that story. Her natural humanity had caused her to
pity both the girl and her father, but her traditional morality
had led her to judge with the rest of the world. Girls "who went
astray"--there could be only one verdict. She pitied and she
condemned. But that was so long ago; there wasn't a better man in
the world; and while the girl had the decency to stay away from
the town the matter must surely be forgotten.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was a "foreigner"--not one of their kind--
would he spoil their jollity and merriment? Would every one be
shy and awkward and silent? She wondered whether she had been
wise.</p>

<p>But her questions were soon answered. As soon as he came in
she was reassured. So smart in his black silk waistcoat and yet
so healthy with his red-brown, pippin-apple face, and yet again
so easy with his handshake and his boyish laugh as he saw the
bright, loaded table. Oh! a nice little man! And he started with
surprise when he saw Maude, hadn't expected that she would be so
beautiful, in white, radiant, so beautiful, so beautiful.--And
Mrs. Boultewood? No, he didn't know Mrs. Boultewood, nor Miss
Boultewood, nor Mr. Boultewood. He was greatly pleased to have
the honour. . . . But Squires! You here! Now that is excellent.
Excellent. Upon my word, excellent. And Mr. Fletch. Of course he
knows Mr. Fletch. Who in Polchester doesn't? How do you do, Mr.
Fletch? A nasty March evening with a nip in the . . . but his
gaze continually returned to Maude. He hadn't expected her to be
like that. And to-night she was wonderful. . . . Wonderful was
the word. Her birthday of course. Her party. She would be
excited, and excitement always lends . . . Miss Midgeley? Why, of
course, he knew Miss Midgeley! How do you do, Miss Midgeley?
Isn't this a delightful gathering? Yes, a cold evening but it's
warm enough in . . . And where's my friend Harmer John? A most
punctual man as a rule. Oh yes, every one calls him that now. He
seems to have become a regular town favourite, which is odd
because the town's conservative. Oh, conservative undoubtedly.
None the worse for that, perhaps, but for a foreigner to have
made so emphatic a mark in so short a time is remarkable, nothing
short of remarkable. What's that? A bird-cage? Under that green
cloth? A nightingale? A present for Miss Maude? Why, how
charming! Birds are such pleasant . . . ! Does he know Mr. Harty?
No, he hasn't that pleasure. Mr. Harty plays the violin. Will
give them some dance music after supper. First rate. First rate.
Nice old gentleman with long white hair, knee-breeches and large
buckles to his shoes.</p>

<p>Every one was present save Johanson, and in another moment he
was there too. He came down the stairs and through the door with
a rush as he always did, having very little time, it seemed, to
waste. He was fine to-night, splendidly washed and brushed and
handsome. "Never seen him look so well," thought Longstaffe--and
then for the first time considered the two--Harmer John and Maude
Penethen. Maude Penethen and Harmer John. He had not considered
it. His friend had said nothing. But now when he looked at
them--how could either help it? She so lovely and he so jolly.
What woman would not love him, not in every mood perhaps, but as
he stood there laughing, so good-humoured, so boyish, so honest
and true? Sentimental? But no. Why was it sentimental to admire
good-humour and courage and honesty, qualities quite as
interesting in their way as cynicism, irony and disbelief, and
easier, far easier, to live with? But as he looked at his friend
he was unexpectedly irritated. He did not want him to marry that
girl. Why? He did not know. He knew nothing against her. She
looked good-nature and amiability itself as she stood there
laughing with her uncle. He did not know why, but he did not want
it.</p>

<p>Then Harmer John's hand was on his shoulder, his voice in his
ear: "It's jolly, no? You was thinking I was dead? Yes, not
to-night, thank you."</p>

<p>Then they all sat down with a great deal of laughter and
confusion and barking from Caesar the dog, who had a blue ribbon
tied through his collar and looked foolish accordingly.</p>

<p>This was the way they sat down:</p>

<p align="CENTER">Mr. Fletch</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That was exactly what the table looked like except that, as I
have said, it was all in the gayest colours. In the background
was Mary-Thomasine, crimson in the face, breathing hard through
the nostrils, and in fact like any serving-maid in any novel of
English country life.</p>

<p>She was as happy as any one of them. In any case she adored a
party, but her special devotion was for Mr. Squires. Whenever he
came to the house she was in ecstasies. To look at him was enough
for her in any ordinary way, but to have an opportunity of
serving him, of handing him potatoes in their jackets, and beer
and fruit in its season--was not that enough good fortune to last
her for a week of Sundays? Last of all there was Prudence the
cat, who, motionless with closed eyes, lay in patient unswerving
hopefulness beneath the nightingale's cage.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They were soon all jolly enough. At first there had been a
little stiffness, and Mrs. Penethen and the girls were busied
with attending to different appetites, but Ben Squires was not
one to remain quiet for long and he had scarcely taken a mouthful
before he was leaning broadside across the table shouting out to
Harmer John his famous story of Ma Appletree and the Ghost of the
Butcher--a story so well known to every one else at the table
that the mere sound of the accustomed words put the company at
ease.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boultewood was exceedingly well pleased. To have Mr.
Fletch at her side for a whole meal with only that old
crooked-faced Miss Midgeley on the other side of him was
wonderful indeed. She pecked at her food like a hungry but
nervous bird, and examined every mouthful very carefully as
though she were enquiring its price.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Fletch," she said, "it's a long time since I've had
the chance of having a word with you. I've always wanted to thank
you for telling me about that sale at Rosemeath Farm. There were
one or two things there that were real bargains, I assure
you."</p>

<p>Reuben Fletch, who, in his party black (shiny and faded, but
scrupulously clean) and his over-long locks, resembled tonight
more than ever a poet whose works were superior to the vulgar
demand, turned upon her the gentlest of smiles and said that he
was glad to help his friends. "Well, yes, I'm sure you are, Mr.
Fletch. No one could call me mean whatever else they might say of
me, but if there's a bargain or two about I don't see why I
shouldn't be there with the rest. As I've many a time said to
Aggie: Look after the shillings and the pounds will look after
themselves--talking of which," dropping her voice, "that ham's
cost Fanny Penethen a pretty penny, I'll be bound. However, if
she likes to fling her money about--she's a good soul. I've known
her all my life and if I were at my last gasp I couldn't say
better than that--she's a good soul if foolish." Then, raising
her voice again, "I suppose you've not been letting the grass
grow under your feet since I saw you last, Mr. Fletch?"</p>

<p>Reuben looked at her with the mildness of a cow contemplating
its next dandelion: "I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"In the money way, I mean. You've brought off one or two
pretty little things, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"I wish I had, Mrs. Boultewood," he said, sighing gently into
his plate. "I grub along. That's about all there is to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now. We're too old friends for that, you know. You
can talk safely to me, Mr. Fletch, old friends as we are."</p>

<p>But Mr. Fletch still sighed. "A solicitor in a small way in a
little town like this, Mrs. Boultewood, stands no chance of
becoming a millionaire, I fear. Appreciative though I am of my
hostess's good qualities, I should not be living here, Mrs.
Boultewood, could I afford a little place of my own. And that's
the truth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Boultewood knew well that it was far from the truth, but
for the moment she abandoned the attack. Indeed she had on this
particular evening other preoccupations--family cares. Her
beloved Isaac had, for more than a year, been engrossed with the
beauty of Maude Penethen and, so far as he was capable of any
passion, loved her to distraction. Mrs. Boultewood did not like
Maude; she was, she thought, a stuck-up, self-opinionated little
minx, but she adored her boy and for his sake she would suffer
such a daughter-in-law. She thought, too, that she could train
Maude into a very pretty little piece of subjection before she
had finished with her.</p>

<p>On the other hand there was this strange large foreigner about
whom all the town had, apparently, gone crazy, and Maude, it was
said, went with the town. At the mere thought that he might
interfere with her dear Isaac's happiness, her maternal
protective feelings were aroused.</p>

<p>She disliked the great big baby-faced man, who behaved as
though the whole kitchen belonged to him, at sight. She was
prepared in any case to dislike him, because during the last six
months her Isaac had walked considerably in the company of Samuel
Hogg, had gone with him to local race meetings and football
matches. This friendship had at first alarmed the anxious mother
because Hogg's reputation in the town was queer enough; on the
other hand the man was a kind of uncle-in-law to young Lady St.
Leath and owned about half the town; he was, she had no doubt,
not half what he was painted, and, at least, he was clever enough
at making money--and Isaac thought the world of him. Isaac had,
in fact, on one or two occasions brought him back to the house,
and he had been very polite. On the last of these visits he had
spoken of this foreigner and had given the worst possible account
of him, saying that he was nothing better than an adventurer,
here to plunder the town, as the town would find out one day.</p>

<p>Well, well. . . . Dear, dear. . . . To think that every one
should be so taken in. Great, fat, noisy creature! And to make
your living by rubbing people's stomachs! It was scarcely
decent.</p>

<p>So she had plenty to do, with her good food and her admiration
for Reuben Fletch and her anxiety about her family. Plenty to do.
She was as busy as a hen in a neighbour's garden.</p>

<p>Like mother was not, in the Boultewood family, like daughter.
Aggie Boultewood frequently differed from her mother. She did so
on this occasion, falling in love with Mr. Johnson at sight. This
was nothing new for her. She was always falling in love with men
and then hating them when they abandoned her. She always saw it
as wicked abandonment, although, often enough, all the advance
movements were made by herself. But to-night it seemed that she
received real encouragement. To her tittering and giggling
remarks Harmer John made the most generous replies, turning round
to her, giving her his full attention and looking into her eyes
in a way that, surely, every one at the table must be remarking.
Of course, she was an heiress. And he was a foreigner--and
foreigners were always laying traps for heiresses; she must be
careful. She did think him the most beautiful man she had ever
seen, and banished entirely from her heart and memory Mr. Ned
Poinder, clerk to the solicitors Kenworthy and Frost, who had,
until this evening, occupied that position.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson--I do want--you'll think me too silly--but might
I ask . . . ?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Anything you please."</p>

<p>"Do you--you'll think it too silly of me--do you have
exercises for ladies too?"</p>

<p>"Too? Too what, Miss Boulteware?"</p>

<p>"No. Too--as well, I mean. Oh! how silly I am not to explain.
But what I mean is, Can you, can I, I mean, have exercises in
your school? or office is it? Where you work, I mean."</p>

<p>"But, of course, Miss Boulteware. Any day you wish. There was
two ladies this morning, and I made them work, I can tell you.
You come along any morning. It will do you plenty of good, truly
it will. You bring your mother, too. Do her good. I shall be very
pleased to welcome you."</p>

<p>"Oh dear. That <i>is</i> kind. I'm sure mother would. And will
you really give me them yourself--the exercises, I mean--and not
leave me to some assistant?"</p>

<p>"If we appoint a time I shall give them you all myself, but
the day now are getting full, and I thank God for it too. I don't
hope I'll ever be idle another minute, I can tell you, Miss
Boulteware."</p>

<p>But by this time the whole table was in an uproar. Every one
was so jolly and so noisy and so merry that Mary-Thomasine,
bringing the jam tarts from the oven, thought that there had
never before been such a party. Even Miss Midgeley was happy,
practising some innocent sarcasms on the helpless Isaac, who
could but gaze on her, open his mouth and shut it again as though
he were pretending to guess the answer to some riddle far too
difficult for him.</p>

<p>The festival was now so triumphant that no one need notice the
demureness of Maude. It <i>was</i> noticed. Her mother and her
sister and Reuben Fletch noticed it--no one else. Unless it were
Prudence under the bird-cage who, absorbed in the bird as she
was, nevertheless remembered her mistress.</p>

<p>Never before at her birthday party had Maude Penethen been so
quiet. From the moment when Mr. Longstaffe said his beautiful
Grace, wishing for a blessing on all God's bountiful gifts here
provided, to the moment of Ben Squires' birthday speech, Maude
sat like a little nun, helping at first to make sure that every
one was happily started, then eating a little, talking a little,
smiling a little, and turning upon Isaac Boultewood so rich and
lustrous a gaze that that poor young man, harassed already by
Miss Midgeley's incomprehensibilities, could only plunge ever
deeper into the mire of his adoration and feel himself to be
sinking, sinking, sinking. . . .</p>

<p>She did not rouse herself even at the boisterous birthday
greetings showered down upon her by her uncle. What compliments
he paid her! To what flowers he compared her, to what dawns and
stars and moons, to what goddesses and Peris and Naiads, to what
virtues and estimabilities and heavenly qualities! He reached
that stage so customary in after-dinner speaking, when he had
said everything that he had to say, but could not wind up and
conclude; in a desperation bred of amiability and cider he leaned
forward across the table and mentioned "our foreign guest" whom
we were all so pleased to see, whom the town of Polchester was
proud to honour, whom we were all so thankful to have the chance
of knowing, whom we were all so pleased to see, whom the town,
etc.: and then quite unexpectedly sat down, to his own surprise
as much as to any one else's.</p>

<p>Harmer John rose and said that he thanked them all very much;
that he didn't know English well, so that perhaps they would
excuse the way he spoke it. That he knew what an honour it was
that a foreigner like himself, who had been in the town but a
short time, should be invited to so intimate a gathering, but
that he was so proud to be a friend of Miss Maude Penethen and of
Mrs. Penethen and of all his other friends here that he sometimes
forgot, perhaps too easily, how lucky he was. That was their
fault for being so kind to him. He felt that this town was his
home, and he would like to do something for this town in return
for its being good to him. But he didn't want to talk about
himself. It was Miss Maude Penethen's birthday. He would not pay
her compliments. The gentleman opposite him had already done that
so beautifully. They had a story in Sweden about a dwarf who
lived in a hole in an island near Stockholm, and he was very
miserable and very lonely and very bitter. And one day the young
Princess went by in her beautiful golden boat, and the dwarf
looked out from his hole and hated the Princess because she was
beautiful and he was so ugly. And the Princess was so good and so
pure that she always felt in her spirit when some one near her
was unhappy. "Some one is unhappy near me," she cried. And the
Court Magician who was at her side said, "Yes, there is some one
ugly and unhappy near you. If you throw what you treasure most
into the water, that will make him happy and beautiful again."
She hesitated a moment because she knew what it was that she
loved most; it was her gold box that held the crystal ball. But
it was only for a moment that she hesitated. She picked it up and
threw it into the water. At the same moment the dwarf was changed
into a beautiful Prince. A week later he came to the Court,
bringing with him the gold box which had been washed on to his
island by the kindly waves. A little metal polish and it was
bright as ever. The moment the Princess saw him she loved him and
<i>of course</i> he loved her. So they were married and lived
happily ever after. "You must see," he ended, bowing a little to
Maude, "what power beauty when it are joined to great goodness of
heart can be able of. I will drink Miss Maude Penethen's
health."</p>

<p>How they applauded! What a beautiful story! Only Maude had not
a word. She blushed, rose for a moment, said something that was
the ghost of "Thank you," and sat down again. It was then that
Tom Longstaffe knew how correct his suspicions had been.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The tables were cleared, the chairs ranged against the wall.
Then old Mr. Harty was seen in his full glory. He had been a
little overwhelmed at supper with all the noise and heartiness,
and his teeth behaved erratically, and his digestion was
uncertain so that he must be careful about his food, but now
behold him in his glory perched upon a chair with his beloved
fiddle tucked under his chin! Before this he had been a rather
decrepit old gentleman who had the obscene and derelict habit of
taking snuff; now, in a moment of time, he had his rightful place
in the world, his eyes shining, his nose twitching, his buckled
shoe tapping, and his fingers moving like loving spirits about
the violin. No one in Polchester was better than he at this; none
of your modern bands and ridiculous pianists. He had the music in
his blood, and his fiddle had it too. He was in it for love, for
love of Mrs. Penethen, whom he greatly admired, for love of that
pretty little "piece," her daughter, but best of all for love of
his divine mistress, music. Was he bachelor and childless? Was he
poor, and had he only a small bed-sitting-room off Orange Street?
Was he considered mad by his relations, and a dotard by his
contemporaries? Ask his mistress why this was so. And did he
regret an instant of his faithful service? Look at him, perched
up there, with his white hair flying and you had your answer.
They were all dancing--Mrs. Penethen and Tom Longstaffe, Miss
Midgeley and Mr. Squires, young Boultewood and Maude; Judy and
Harmer John, Miss Boultewood and Mr. Fletch; only Mrs. Boultewood
sat bolt upright in her chair counting the cost of the shoe
leather, and Mary-Thomasine, standing in the doorway sucking the
corner of her apron and imagining the arrival of a fairy
godmother who would throw her straight into the glorious arms of
Mr. Squires.</p>

<p>Dance followed dance; the world was ever gayer and more gay;
midnight had struck and beyond the windows the moon was cold like
a cheese-paring, and the stars through the wisps of fog gleamed
like fire-flies in a scatter of hay. The lights of the streets
were dead, and the Cathedral was humped, black, its paws out,
gripping the town; a cold wind nipped round the corners and
sighed away into the woods and the tufted hills; but in the
Penethen kitchen it was hotter and hotter and hotter.</p>

<p>"Come up, Miss Maude," a voice was in her ear, "up the
staircase."</p>

<p>They stayed side by side on the landing by the little window
that looked out to the faintly shining sky. They stood side by
side. She was trembling. He put his arm around her, and drew her
close to him. She trembled yet more, put out her hand, and
timidly rested it on his broad back. His other hand caught hers
and drew her arm around him--"I love you, Maude. I ever loved you
from the first moment I saw your sweet face. You've took me your
prisoner, and now, whichever way you think of me, I can't ever
escape again. It wouldn't be much to say I'd be good to you--any
man would be that--but what other could I say? I don't suppose
you can love me yet. I'm a stranger here and foreign--any ways
half of me--but you have the beginnings of liking me, and I'll
make it grow like a flower. Will you marry me? I don't hope--oh!
I don't hope you'll say no."</p>

<p>He sighed with his anxiety. If she looked up she could just
see his round face and black hair untidy with the dancing. He
seemed immense to her just then; immense in his height and
breadth, in his strength and force. She had no thought of
anything save his physical proximity. This was what she had
desired, thought of for weeks and weeks; of no more than this and
of nothing further than this. That she should be held by him and
pressed close by his arms and feel his heart beating beneath her
cheek; that with the physical power that he had she should feel
on her side also power, that she so small and weak could force
him to such subjection that he would do all that she should
ask.</p>

<p>She murmured something. He did not hear what it was, but her
gesture towards him, her hand moving up to his neck above his
collar, her head resting against his heart, told him
everything.</p>

<p>They stayed in the dim shadow of that wall, the music coming
up to them utterly unheeded, the little sad breeze teasing at the
window with restless fingers, then, wandering off into the dark,
knowing that its time would come.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c108">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>

<h1>FOUR MEN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>So swiftly do superstition and legend climb mountain-high that
although we are now but some seventeen or eighteen years from the
period with which this history is concerned, nevertheless the
facts of Johanson's first connection with the Cathedral
authorities are hard accurately to discover. Nor is that
discovery of great importance. In so small a town as Polchester
the settling there of any stranger would have, at least, its
gossipy consequences. Afterwards when it was discovered that he
was a man of unusual character who intended to take some place in
the town's affairs, it followed naturally that the leaders of the
town's parties in local politics would consider him and his
possibilities. And at about the time of Johanson's engagement to
Maude Penethen, four men, entirely opposed to one another in
training, temperament and purpose, did so consider him. Upon the
lives of all those men he was to have a deep and lasting effect.
And he himself was not to know, even at the very end, that he had
affected them at all.</p>

<p>One of these men he hated. With all his amiable and friendly
qualities he could be an excellent hater. He was not mean nor sly
in his hatred, but a streak of obstinacy ran through it,
obstinacy that came from his simplicity of view and inability for
subtleties; did he once convince himself that a man was, from his
position, really bad, it was hard to shake him in that.</p>

<p>Now bad men in this world of ours are exceedingly rare--rarer
than anything else to be found here; weak and stupid men on every
side, but bad--no. There is insanity in absolute badness,
something motiveless, or something that reaches out, with a
longing arrogance, beyond the motive: Iago lusted after Desdemona
a little and hated Othello a great deal, but beyond those tiny
passions was a lust to possess the evil deed as a thing worth
having in itself, a flower, a jewel of the mind, a trophy of the
intellect.</p>

<p>In this same fashion Samuel Hogg, who is perhaps the true
protagonist in Harmer John's battle, lusted after vanity and
cruelty and lies not as things in any way valuable in themselves,
but rather as paying fine tribute to his ever hungry arrogance.
He was indeed no Iago; mentally sluggish, ignorant, loutish,
without any vision, but vanity clothed him with all the robes of
glory.</p>

<p>He had at this time an odd position in our town. It was
significant of the social change that had enveloped us that such
as he should hold it. Born the son of an itinerant pedlar, kicked
up through the mire and filth of Seatown, the Polchester slums,
into the position of bottle-boy in a Seatown public-house,
keeping always one of his little eyes open to the main chance,
betting successfully here, stealing triumphantly there, winning
at last the heart of the publican's meek white-faced daughter, he
succeeded to those pot-house splendours. And there, in all
probability, he would for ever have stayed, in spite of mean
little conspiracies and unsuccessful little blackmails, had not
his only child, a handsome independent girl, hating her father
and longing for any escape, eloped to London with the son of our
Archdeacon Brandon, the lord at that time of our ecclesiastical
country. This had been swiftly followed by the death of Brandon
and the marriage of his only daughter to young Lord St. Leath,
owner of most of Glebeshire and the king of the castle above
Polchester. By the strangest sequence of events, therefore, Sam
Hogg, proprietor of "The Dog and Pilchard," became
cousin-of-a-sort to lords, ladies and "all the clergy." Not that
his daughter ever set eyes on him again (although he did what he
could to force claims upon her), nor, naturally enough, did
Johnny St. Leath greet him as a brother; that mattered little
enough; sufficient for him that he could boast and rant to all
his vanity's desire, and boast and rant he did. It happened also
that from this time things went well with him. Perchance his wits
were sharpened; maybe men dealt with him more readily now that he
was related to the "Quality." He made money; he bought property;
soon most of Seatown was his. He found an ally in Reuben Fletch,
and through him formed some loose connection in small business
affairs with some of the better people of the town, with some of
the clergy and even with our great Canon Ronder himself who,
advised by Fletch, bought a little Seatown property from Hogg. He
mended his manners, wore quieter clothes, took a little house in
Orange Street, and was cared for by an elderly and most
respectable widow. His principal danger was liquor; he had been a
drunkard in his Seatown days, and the evidence was yet in the
little purple veins that ran across his puffy cheeks, but had you
seen him walking slowly up the High Street in decent broadcloth,
his bowler hat smartly brushed, a fine cane held behind his stout
back, you would have thought him a prosperous and respectable
farmer. There was indeed something remarkable in the way that he
threaded the whole life of our town, having relations of one sort
or another with almost every one from the Bishop and Ryle and
Ronder at the top down to the strange animals that moved hither
and thither in the dark obscurity of the Seatown mists.</p>

<p>Socially he did not press his claims upon the town. Dark
things were said of his sensual passions, queer reports peered up
once and again out of the darkness, tales hinted at and
mysteriously whispered--but nothing was positively known.</p>

<p>"A useful man, Hogg. Wouldn't wonder if he's Mayor one
day."</p>

<p>If no one exactly liked him, no one exactly hated him
either--no one until Harmer John came along. And Hogg was useful.
He was useful especially to those men--Croppet and Harrow,
Barnaby and Summers--who wanted to popularise our town, to make
it a sort of perpetual Fair with hurdy-gurdies and roundabouts,
to make the Cathedral a peep-show and the market-place a railway
centre, to run excursions to the seaside and from the seaside to
the town. He was the kind of man they needed. He would do their
dirty work and would be fool enough to be tricked by them at the
end when his services had been rendered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his vanity mounted and mounted and mounted. That was
his true vice, the hidden creature biting at his breast. And it
must be fed and protected and cared for. Any slight to it,
something far short of insult, and his anger was roused with all
the force and strength that only the vanity of small and mean and
cruel men can summon.</p>

<p>And that was why <i>he</i> hated Harmer John. On that first
evening in Mrs. Penethen's kitchen his vanity had been wounded by
the attention paid to this stranger. Soon there were many other
fine reasons.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On an afternoon late in March Sam Hogg stood in Reuben
Fletch's small office that was second floor in 19 Winnery's Lane
to the back of the market-place and just under St. James's
Church. An obscure little cul-de-sac that grew grass between its
cobbles, and a poor little room with oleographs of their
Majesties the King and the Queen on the walls, an American
roll-top desk and precious little else. Where Fletch kept all his
papers, papers that involved most of the town in one way or
another, was always a mystery.</p>

<p>Hogg leant back against the mantelpiece, his stout body
covering the empty fire-place, his arms akimbo and his hat on the
back of his head. His flushed cheeks, his bulging waistcoat,
formed a well-fed contrast with the thin poetic features of
Fletch seated at his desk. Hogg to-day, as on many a past
occasion, was trying to discover both what Fletch thought and
what he intended to do, and for once in a way Fletch told him. He
doubtless had his own good reasons.</p>

<p>"You're much too impetuous, Sam," Fletch said, raising his
mild eyes to the faded ceiling. "Wait and see how things turn
out. There's plenty of time."</p>

<p>"That's just what I'm not so sure there is," said Hogg,
impatiently moving his shoulders and kicking one leg forward,
"he's getting so damned popular, blarst him. I went in the other
afternoon, pretending I wanted some exercises, just to look
around a bit, and the place was fair humming. 'Is 'Ighness
couldn't see me just at the moment. Would I wait? Well, no, I
wouldn't. I'd have kicked his whole bloody place to pieces if I'd
stayed another five seconds."</p>

<p>"That's you all over," said Fletch quietly. "Why get so
excited about it? The man hasn't done you any harm as yet, beyond
getting engaged to a girl whom you couldn't marry however hard
you wanted to. We've got a hold over him with those rooms of his.
He's as simple and unsuspicious as a puppy. Leave him alone and
watch the way things turn out. Either he'll be a real success and
very useful to us, or he'll make a mess of it and cook his own
goose, so to speak."</p>

<p>"You're so detached, Reuben," said Hogg, quite plaintively.
"And yet you've got your passions--as far as money goes, anyway.
If he stole five pounds from your till you'd be excited
enough."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I'd show it if I were," said Fletch. "You
always get more by keeping quiet. Besides, I quite like the
fellow. There's something rather taking about him."</p>

<p>"Taking! That's just the word!" said Hogg, with an oath. "He's
taken the only pretty girl in the place as it is, although he
hasn't got her yet, by God. But I fair hate the man. I did from
the first moment I set eyes on him, and when I hate a man I want
to do him an injury. That's the sort of man I am."</p>

<p>"You've been drinking, Sam," said Fletch. "That's foolish of
you. You know you can't stand liquor nowadays, and you've been
drinking much too often lately. You always go and do something
foolish when you're this way. What do you do it for?"</p>

<p>"What do I do it for? What does any man do it for? Isn't a man
what is a man to have any bloody pleasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you can't stand it as another man can. You know how
well things have gone with you lately, and it's only because
you've kept off drink. Why go and spoil everything?"</p>

<p>"By God, you're right, Reuben!" Hogg moved away from the
fire-place and stood, his fat legs straddling. "There isn't a man
in the place that has risen as I've done. And who's there been to
help me? No one. Who's ever held me out a helping finger? No one.
I'm the most remarkable man in this town, and most of them knows
it. And I haven't stopped growing neither. No, by God, I
haven't."</p>

<p>Fletch looked at him as though surrendering to a mild and
pleasant admiration. "Well, then," he said, "don't ruin it all by
taking to drink again."</p>

<p>"Paugh!" said Hogg, "what's a drop now and then? The thought
of that foreign bastard pawing that girl all over's enough to
make any decent man drink. Damn 'im! With 'is baby face and 'is
foreign words and 'is Almighty manners! I'll have him on his
knees before the year's out or my name's not Sam Hogg."</p>

<p>He moved about the room, lurching ever so slightly, then, as
though at some sudden thought, steadied himself and moved across
to Fletch's table. "But you're right, Reuben. You're right. Quiet
and patient's the word. If Ronder and those other bugs are going
to take to him we can work a thing or two. I see that as clearly
as you can."</p>

<p>A door of an inner room opened, and a long thin boy with
spectacles and a haggard expression brought Fletch some papers,
then, without a word, but sighing deeply, retired into the inner
room again.</p>

<p>"Well, I can see you're busy," said Hogg, who had long ago
learnt his friend's signals. "I'll be off. I'll make up to that
swine and see if I can get something out of him. But he'd better
not come up against me. He'd better look out. He'll be sorry
before he's finished with me. So long, old cock." He swaggered
out, banging the door behind him. He had been drinking a little,
but not very much, and the cool March air soon sobered him
completely.</p>

<p>As he turned the corner out of the shabby little street and
came abruptly into the noise and bustle that eddied, like a pool
stirred by wind, at the bottom of the High Street, he thought
what a good fellow he was. A good sort. A kindly man. A credit to
any town. And because it had always been the way with him that he
could only think of one thing at a time, he saw himself a
glorious figure, just above the flight of steps that led down to
the river, the town a quaint huddled background to his splendour,
and the world compressed into one bending figure murmuring, "And
all this he has done for himself, no one helping him! He has made
himself what he is! From small beginnings he has come to this!"
Clever too! He could see as far as Fletch with all his cunning
and secrecy! A trifle more impetuous, perhaps, more red blood in
his body, not a bag of grasping bones like--He was interrupted,
called from his glorious self-contemplation, and the thing that
called him was the vision of his friend, Canon Ronder, on the
very point of beginning his ascent of the High Street.</p>

<p>He smiled, a little sly, self-congratulatory smile. He had
drunk just enough and was self-flattered just enough to receive
his opportunity with open arms. He saw two things with a
swiftness a little above his everyday perception. He saw that it
would add greatly to his own self-esteem to walk up the High
Street with the Canon, and that it would be a kind of
demonstration in the face of all the world as to how friendly
with the Canon he was.</p>

<p>His self-esteem prevented him from perceiving a third point in
its favour--namely, that it would annoy the Canon very
greatly.</p>

<p>It <i>did</i> annoy him when, feeling a tap on his shoulder,
he turned and saw Hogg's red face and sly, confidential smile. It
was true that he had been forced of late, for the good of the
town, to see something of the man. For the good of the town he
had thought it right to take an interest in civic things and even
to buy a little town property, but all this was very far from
being seen prominently in close companionship.</p>

<p>Only ten years ago Hogg had been concerned with the death of
one of the town's most prominent Churchmen in a fashion that was
more than suspicious; he had been a drunkard and a wastrel, thief
and even blackmailer, it was said. It was true that he was now a
greatly reformed character, and that such men as Croppet and
Harrow took him into their civic confidences and even suggested
him as a possible future Town Councillor: all this was far from
the open demonstration of acquaintanceship that an intimate walk
up the High Street admitted. And yet how difficult! It seemed
that if you took one step, a thoroughly justified step, in a
certain direction it led you inevitably to a future step not
quite so justified. He disliked the man cordially, but he could
not, as things now were, afford to make an enemy of him. The man
was at his side. He must endure his company. With every step,
however, his discomfort grew. The ten years that he had spent at
Polchester had not made him less sensitive to public opinion. He
had won success and popularity in the very first six months of
his life there, won them with exceeding ease. Circumstances had
helped him, of course, but once those pleasant things were his,
once the comfort and even luxury of his life cushioned him round,
ease, popularity and high position became important to him as
they had never been before. He had always liked them, of course,
but now they were absolute necessities, and clutching them to
himself he heard, more and more clearly as the years passed,
voices, whispers, shadows of whispers threatening to take them
away. He could not put his finger on his detractors; that was the
trouble; he would have said that he had no enemies in the place.
And yet--and yet--Ambrose Wistons, whom he had himself helped to
bring into the diocese; it was not true to say that he was more
respected, nevertheless his name was for ever to be heard, now an
article in a paper, now a sermon in his village church, now a
discussion at some gathering over something that Wistons had
said, now some comment on his strange, ascetic life--and all this
although Wistons held himself apart from all men, made no
friends, went socially almost nowhere, interested himself not at
all in the life of the town, paid no man compliments, was of the
rude and brusque in his manner. And yet--and yet--Would Sam Hogg
have tapped Wistons on the shoulder and said in that thick,
confidential voice, "Well, Canon. A bit nippy this air--more rain
before night"?</p>

<p>No, Ronder, behind that rosy, cheery face, behind those round,
shining glasses, was not comfortable, nor was his happiness
increased when, as he advanced up the street with his unwelcome
companion, he seemed to pass every one whom he least wished to
see: there was that gossipy Mrs. Bond with her eldest boy, there
was that simpering Mrs. Ryle, there Julia Preston and Mrs.
Bentinck-Major--all the chattering women of the town!</p>

<p>"About those bits of houses of yours, Canon," Hogg was saying
(odious figure with his rolling, swaggering gait, stick fixed
between his arms behind his back, hat tilted slightly to one
side), "there's another nice little lot likely to come into the
market pretty soon--a bit higher up than your two or
three--towards Roston's Mill. They should come in for a mere
song, I should say, and nothing wants doing to them; least when I
say <i>nothing,</i> what I mean is they can go on very well for a
year or two without anything doing. The tenants that's there now
seems contented enough."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me, Mr. Hogg," said Ronder, speaking nervously
and looking about him left and right, "some one was saying the
other night that the whole of Seatown wants pulling down, that
conditions there are a disgrace. I haven't gone into it myself,
and I believe the Town Council's very well satisfied. Of course
there was all that trouble in Nineteen Two and things should be
all right now. Nevertheless, I shouldn't like to be owning
property that's a disgrace to the town. I must go down myself and
have a look."</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> somebody saying?" broke in Hogg bitterly. "That's
just the sort of gentleman who wants ducking in the Pol, if you
ask <i>me!</i> Just the sort of nosing round into somebody else's
business that you'd expect from a foreigner, a dirty German or a
Dutchman like that booby-face who's going to teach us all
gymnastics. Beg pardon, Canon, if I'm speaking too strong, but I
can't abide these nosey-parkers with their meddling round other
folks' business. It's true enough that there ain't any
marble-tiled bathrooms in Seatown, but what would they do with
'em if you gave 'em them? Fill them with a month's coal, of
course. Who knows if I don't? Who's lived there if I haven't? And
mighty comfortable I was, too, for donkey's years. Why, I'd never
have moved if it hadn't been the thought of my daughter who used
to make it homelike for me, and her deserting me as she did sort
of made me take against the place. No, Canon, don't you pay no
attention to those gas-bags. Go down for yourself, Canon, and
see. There isn't a brighter or a 'appier spot in Polchester than
Seatown."</p>

<p>After which long speech, Samuel Hogg brought his stick to the
ground with a bang and looked about him with a triumphant
smirk.</p>

<p>They were half-way up the High Street by now. The street was
filled with people and on every side of him Ronder fancied that
he detected glances of surprise at his company. Detected falsely,
no doubt! There was a time when he was wise enough to know that
every man is concerned first with himself, and only afterwards,
and at a great distance, with the behaviours and eccentricities
of his fellow human beings. We are safer than we know. But his
nervousness made him speak more sharply than he intended. "Well,
Mr. Hogg, you can take it as settled that I buy no more property
in that direction. I would not have done what I did had I not
thought it for the town's good that some of the Cathedral Chapter
should take a closer interest in the town's progress. I must go
more nearly into this question of conditions down in Seatown. If
all I hear is true, something must be done."</p>

<p>So that was the way of it, was it? Hogg's little eyes
narrowed. This fat, sleek parson was going to make trouble, was
he? He'd better look out! Hogg knew a thing or two, Hogg did.
He'd better look out. But who was this who'd been talking about
Seatown? Devilish awkward if people began poking their noses in
that direction again. What about this Harmer John with his
gymnastics and the rest, improving the body and all that my-eye?
Why not? Just the kind of rotten foreigner to go interfering with
other people's business!</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, Canon," Hogg said confidentially (how odious
his confidence to Ronder's sensitive soul!), "but it wasn't this
new gymnastic fellow what's been talking to you about Seatown,
was it?"</p>

<p>"Gymnastic fellow?" said Ronder, bowing to Mrs. Preston and
looking about him for some avenue of escape. "Gymnastic
fellow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, him they call Harmer John. Great tall fellow who's
opened a gymnasium. I know you're acquainted with him, and I
thought--"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," said Ronder, hurriedly; "an excellent man.
Quite an asset to the town. Oh no, he knows nothing about
Seatown. Why should he? Ah, I go in here--if you'll excuse me,
Mr. Hogg. Good afternoon. <i>Good</i> afternoon." He turned into
Bennett's bookshop, that same doorway in which his old dead rival
had once also sought refuge, and left Hogg standing there. Left
him also in no amiable state of mind, left him in that unhappy
state of wounded pride and creeping suspicion that can only mean
danger when men of Hogg's half-human mentality see their security
threatened.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Stepping hurriedly into the dim bookishness of the old shop,
he saw, as on a similar occasion Brandon himself had once seen,
that Wistons was there. Wistons was, just then, exactly the man
whom he did not wish to see. But it was too late to retreat. He
nodded friendlily, his spectacles catching the gaslight so that
he seemed all shining with amiability. Then he sat down in the
old arm-chair near the books, the arm-chair that had held so many
a worthy book-lover before him, and gazed pleasantly about him,
at the framed letter of Walter Scott's, the two holograph verses
from <i>Don Juan,</i> a Dickens scribble with lines like a
staircase under the signature; pleasantly, but in his heart he
was irritated to-day by that tall, lean, ascetic body as perhaps
he had never been before. How it towered above him and how quiet
and aloof and reserved it was! He looked down at his own stout
thighs, spotless trousers, shining boots, and wished, how
fervently he wished, that he had avoided this meeting.</p>

<p>One never knew how Wistons would take anything: on a day he
would scarcely be aware of his surroundings, on another he would
be friendly and agreeable. To-day little Mr. Carter, the new
shopman (from London with new ideas, new authors, new
prophecies), came rolling forward and asked what it was that he
could do for Canon Ronder. Canon Ronder wanted Trelawny's
<i>Recollections of Shelley and Byron,</i> and Mr. Carter went to
search among the second-hand shelves in the rear of the shop.</p>

<p>Wistons, whose nose had been buried in a number of the
<i>Hibbert Journal,</i> looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Ronder, do you know anything of a man I am about to visit, a
Swede, I think, Johanson by name, a gymnast or a masseur?"</p>

<p>Ronder looked up smiling:</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I know him quite well. He has been coming during
the last fortnight and giving me massage. A good fellow, I think.
I like him. But <i>you</i> don't look as though you needed
massage."</p>

<p>He laughed in that friendly, easy, natural manner of his that
had become by now <i>so</i> natural to him that it had ceased to
be natural at all; only nobody knew that. Wistons seldom laughed.
"No," he answered gravely, "it isn't for that I'm going. I'm
interested in what I've heard about him. You know little
Longstaffe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"He has been talking about him to me. Longstaffe's a loyal
little fellow and all his geese are swans, but this man does seem
something out of the common. I promised Longstaffe I'd go, so I
wrote and made an appointment. He <i>is</i> a Swede, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"A Swede or a Dane. I can never tell them apart. His English
might belong to either. He seems to mean to settle down here. He
has got himself engaged to a girl of the place."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't know that!" Wistons' nose was deep in
<i>Hibbert</i> again. Ronder said: "Did you know that
Longstaffe's daughter is coming back here to live?"</p>

<p>And in his heart he was saying, "You pig! I'll make you attend
to me. Who brought you to this place if I didn't, and now you are
as remote from me as though I lived in another world. Not good
enough for yours, I suppose! But I'll smash your remoteness. I'll
make you come down from your pedestal!" A strange little wind of
anger blew up in his soul, strange because he was seldom angry.
But he seemed to feel a crisis between himself and Wistons as
though months and months of action had been preparing for this
meeting in the book-shop, a crisis the stronger because Wistons
was himself so completely unaware of it. His anger needed
physical expression and he jumped to his feet. They stood close
together under the gaslight, one round and shining, the other
brown and spare.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a pity, don't you think, that Longstaffe should have
his daughter back here?" His voice was peremptory and so unlike
his accustomed suavity that Wistons' attention was caught. He
stood, twisting his lips in a way that he had, his eyes staring
into the book-shelves.</p>

<p>"No. It all happened long ago. It should be forgotten now.
Poor girl, she has paid in sorrow and grief."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ronder irritably. "But that is just what some of
the women in this place will not remember. They have long
memories for the scandalous part of it, though."</p>

<p>"How long is it since it happened?"</p>

<p>"Some seven or eight years, I fancy."</p>

<p>"And she's bringing the child with her?"</p>

<p>"Of course." Then Ronder went on. "It's for Longstaffe's sake
I'm sorry. He's a fine fellow and doing a fine work here. He'll
have trouble, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Well, what if he does?" Wistons turned on Ronder. "You're too
much afraid of trouble. Why not trouble and difficulty and
sorrow? Why not? Why not? Good for us. Good for us all," and,
turning, dropping the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> on the chair as he
passed, he had left the shop.</p>

<p>Ronder stared about him, hoping that no one had witnessed that
abruptness. But really! To treat him, Ronder, in that fashion!
Things were going too far. They were indeed. As good as though he
had told Ronder to his face that he was too comfortable. After
Ronder's own courtesy and kindness. He did hope that nobody had
witnessed that strange outburst. For Wistons' own sake it would
never do. Mr. Carter came forward washing his hands and
grievously saying that there was no "Trelawny" just now.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Never mind." Ronder was nervously brushing his
hat. "Try and get it for me from London. Good day. Good day."</p>

<p>He passed under the Arden Gate, angry as though some one had
rolled him in the dust. The thing was going too far! He would let
Wistons know.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But Wistons had already forgotten that Ronder existed. He was
suffering just now, as he often suffered, from a mood of intense
depression. God had veiled Himself from him, and He had veiled
Himself rightly, because he, Ambrose Wistons, had so terribly
failed in his task. That task, given to him ten years ago, had
been to bring these people nearer to God. And he had not brought
them. He had done nothing. It was as though he had never
existed.</p>

<p>When he had spoken those words to Ronder he had intended them
for himself. It seemed to him to-day that his life during these
last ten years had been spent in the very apron of luxury. His
little country vicarage with its small tangled garden, its few
bare rooms, its old cook-housekeeper, appeared to him extravagant
splendour. Everything had gone well with him there; he had been
tended and watched over like a woman; he had grown soft and
flabby. And as he strode down the hill people looked after him,
at his long bony body, his fierce protesting gaze, his thin
swinging arms, and saw the ascetic, the man who lived only for
God, and felt, too, for a brief instant a strange rending in the
clouds, a glimpse of another journey, a more distant kingdom. . .
.</p>

<p>He liked Johanson's rooms as soon as he crossed the threshold.
A class of boys from the School had just finished their exercises
and were pouring through the doorways, jolly little boys like
dogs, Sealyhams and Scotch terriers and cockers, pugs and
poodles. A man taller and broader than Wistons had expected stood
in the middle of them, himself a collie or Newfoundland. They had
to be pushed out of the room, and old Billy Trenant shouted at
them and pretended terrible rage and enjoyed it hugely. Then they
all saw Wistons, whom they knew well by sight, and in a moment
they were transformed, touching their school caps, decorous,
slipping away in quiet restraint.</p>

<p>Johanson had seen Wistons before although he had never spoken
to him. He came forward holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir?" he said. "Will you not come in?"</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another as fearless men estimate a
newcomer in the first glance, and at once a firm relationship was
established--not at all one of friendship as it had been
immediately between Johanson and Longstaffe, but of something
quite different. Wistons, as he felt the strong, warm grasp of
the other man's hand, knew that in that moment some of his
trouble and depression slipped away from him. Here was a man whom
he could trust: whatever else might appear, that was certain. He
was not a man who made friendships or desired them. He had an
ascetic mind, he had no atom of sentiment in him. He only knew as
he looked at that other honest, open face that he was reassured
and rested as though he had come to a room where there was a
comfortable chair.</p>

<p>And Johanson knew instantly that he was face to face with the
most remarkable human being whom he had yet in his life
encountered. With him also it was not friendship he felt, but
subservience, discipleship. He was eager to hear everything that
this man might say. He would drink in every word, and he had a
curious sense of haste and urgency, as though he knew that he
would not see this man many times but that every meeting would be
of extreme importance to him.</p>

<p>So it was that when they were seated in the little inner room,
close to one another and searching one another's faces, they
dropped all preliminaries, all fencing, all hesitations, and
began at once about themselves, talking eagerly like men to whom
this time is very precious.</p>

<p>The room was small. Wistons sat in the only armchair, his long
thin legs stretched out in front of him. Harmer John, leaning
against the wall, spread out his broad back, looking at his
visitor with eagerness, with a sort of hunger of interest.
"Longstaffe," Wistons began, "is a friend of yours, I know, Mr.
Johanson, and it was he the other day who was speaking of you. Of
course I've heard of you from many people here--you can quickly
become famous in this little town, you know--but Longstaffe told
me that in his opinion you were going to do a great work here,
and therefore--I'll be perfectly frank with you--I was
inquisitive to see the kind of man you are."</p>

<p>Johanson laughed. "I am very happy. I will tell you anything
and perhaps you would help me. This grows so quickly that it is
very difficult to make the foundations steady. So many people
have been writing how it would be possible to make it perfect in
two minutes. I don't hope for that, but I have my own thoughts,
you know, as to how it will all be." Wistons, looking at the man,
liked with every moment increasingly the honest gaze and fearless
mouth. The man was happy with some inner impetus: it might be
merely physical well-being or pleasure at his immediate success,
but with a sort of envy Wistons fancied that it was something
deeper, something for which he had himself long been
searching.</p>

<p>"And what is it exactly, this 'it' that you are after?"
Wistons asked. Johanson needed no encouragement. He never did. He
was always eager to pour out all his story to any one who would
care to listen, touchingly confident that what seemed to himself
so true and amusing would seem so to others. At the first hint of
weariness, however, on the side of the listener he would cease,
blaming himself for his stupidity or carelessness or selfishness,
but he never learnt from these checks. And it was from no egotism
that he poured out his story: he would have told any other story
as eagerly, only this one happened to be true--he would vouch for
it--and so it <i>must</i> perforce, because of that truth, have
an appeal!</p>

<p>Wistons was far from any boredom. He heard it all--the youth
in Stockholm, the bad father, the good mother, half-English, the
artists and their models, the gymnastic training, Copenhagen; and
then the little story of the blue plate, the carpet and
Donatello, the desire for England, the journey, the arrival, the
Penethens, the start of the venture, the money borrowed, some of
it, from that kind, generous man, Mr. Fletch; the success, then
the dream of the new town, the artists coming to Polchester to
make it beautiful, the wonderful world with everything beautiful,
all starting from a <i>little</i> thing--one beautiful stone and
so the beautiful building, one beautiful building and so the
beautiful street, one beautiful street and so the beautiful town,
one beautiful town and so the beautiful country, one beautiful
country and so the beautiful world . . .</p>

<p>"And here is the place with the Cathedral standing in the
middle. Don't you see, sir, that because that monument that the
young man made who was in Italy is so lovely everything in the
town can surely be, in its own way, its own style, and we think
of beautiful things and there are no room in our brain for other
things. The brain have only so much room--fill it up, then, with
what is fine--"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. "You will think, sir, that I want to make
people better. <i>No,</i> sir, I would have them only to see my
idea and then perhaps of themselves they say: 'This is fine. It
is fun to do this.' But not to change them against their wish.
That is so tiresome to interfere in other people's business,
don't you think so, sir? But a few will come who like to be
strong in body and happy in their minds and look out of the
window on fine sights and always to be occupied with kindly
feelings."</p>

<p>"Your idea is not a new one, Mr. Johanson. Many men have
thought as you do and wished passionately to clear some of the
mess away: it has seemed so simple to get a few to think as they
do and then all to work together--and it has been so
difficult--and they have died, most of them, defeated men."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I know, sir," said Johanson eagerly, "I am not
clever. I have had no education, you understand. I have not seen
the world. But it may be because I am an ignorant man and only
know some true things about the body, and have only <i>one</i>
idea, I can do a little and then wiser men come afterwards and do
more.</p>

<p>"We have a clever lady at our house, Miss Midgeley, and she
have read everything, and she lends me books and talks. She has
told me of an Italian gentleman, Garibaldi, who went to Sicily
with only a few friends and one old gun and he conquered
everybody. Yes, he did!" Johanson cried, waxing as enthusiastic
as though Wistons must be hearing of Garibaldi for the first time
in his life. "Indeed he did, sir! and when it were all over and
the King came along and finished it with a big army, Garibaldi
took off his hat and bowed and went home to his farm. Oh, that
were great. I would have liked to have been one of his men and
fought with him--or only just to have seen him . . ." His eyes
stared beyond the walls of the little room. "There isn't time. I
know nothing, I had no education, no books, no clever friends,"
he brought his gaze back, "but I am strong and young and every
one is good to me here."</p>

<p>Wistons, no mean judge of his fellow human beings, gave this
man a penetrating, searching stare. Was he a charlatan? Was he
one of those windy gas-bags who appeared once and again covering
some mean little selfish, mercenary project with fine cheap
phrases and the patter of a tub-thumping park orator? Could any
one in these sophisticated, semi-educated, journalistic days be
so na&iuml;ve, so platitudinous in idea and yet genuine? One
glance was enough to assure him, once for all and for ever, that
this man <i>was</i> genuine, complete, authentic. And who knew
but that out of the mouths of babes and sucklings . . . ?</p>

<p>He was stirred beyond anything that he had expected, but he
did not surrender himself. He was in himself so selfless, so
ascetic in his abnegations that if, for a moment, the thought
came to him that here was a man with whom he could work, into
whom he could pour his own beliefs and creeds, he withdrew at
once. There were to be for him (he knew it absolutely) no human
contacts; he would be alone always; his search for Christ, his
passionate thirst for <i>that</i> intimacy, precluded all others.
Nevertheless, he was touched by this man as he had never before
been touched by any human being.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said slowly. "All my life the beauty of
holiness has been to me perhaps too exclusively the first thing
in all our existence, but I know that there is also a holiness of
beauty, only another door through which we pass to the same
temple." He sighed. "There are other things, though, Mr.
Johanson. Practical things. There is that difficulty you
mentioned--how to spread your idea, your belief, without
interfering with other people's lives. If you build you must
destroy and you must destroy things that other people care for.
You must preach. People, most people--and this little town is not
unlike other towns in this--resent it when you touch what they
care for. They hate your interference with their private lives.
They think you dangerous or foolish. Or they think you can serve
their purpose and would drag you in to fulfil <i>their</i> plans,
not your own. They have their own affairs, money, love, ambition,
and only care for their own projects. To build castles in the air
is one thing, but to pull down castles that other people have
built to make room for your own--then the difficulty begins. I
wouldn't discourage you. I know that what you say is true. But
the people here are like the people elsewhere, no better, no
worse, human. A time may come for you when you will have to
choose--to choose perhaps between a fine business and profit and
success and your Idea, persecution, loneliness, apparent failure.
It has happened many times before; the seeming failure has been
the final success, but the man himself sees no results. They
remain when he has gone."</p>

<p>Johanson nodded his head. "I know something of what you say. I
have felt it myself--but, sir, if such a moment would come I
would try to remember what you tell me. I know, as well, that
there are very many people in the world who will never think the
things beautiful I think--that is natural; but there is some
things <i>so</i> beautiful that every one must be keen at them,
and some things so ugly that every one must wish to destroy them.
I don't hope I'm so conceited as to want to do more than to get a
few friends together and all of us, together, make something.
Shall I show you first what we are doing here and how it goes at
present? Will you come along?"</p>

<p>Wistons readily came with him and was at once astonished at
the other side of the man now revealed to him. Here, at the
business end of the affair, was no dreamer but a very practical
man of business.</p>

<p>It was about human nature, apparently, that the man was
sentimental and idealistic, seeing men and women at a complete
remove from reality, but now in the arrangement of his gymnastic
concern he was as sharp and acute as a "two-thimble lawyer."
First he introduced old Billy Trenant and the boy, who knew
Wistons well enough, but snatched delightedly at an entirely
fresh introduction in honour of the place and occasion.</p>

<p>Their pride and pleasure in their master was very pleasant to
witness. Then he showed Wistons the instruments of torture, the
spring-boards and the horse, the dumb-bells and the rings, the
ropes and the boxing-gloves. Then he showed him his books, all
the engagements he had, and the classes he was starting and the
letters of advice and instruction he was sending into the
country.</p>

<p>He made Billy and the boy do some exercises, and then, tearing
off his collar and coat and waistcoat, he swung himself up to the
rings and did some marvellous evolutions, convolutions, and what
Charles Lamb, speaking of the Elizabethan dramatists, calls
"extraditions."</p>

<p>Wistons, who had never before seen such grace and beauty of
movement in a man, nor a body so strong and magnificently formed,
felt as though he were listening to a piece of very fine music
and was moved accordingly.</p>

<p>Then they went back and sat in the little room again. After a
short silence he said:</p>

<p>"I told you I'd be frank, Mr. Johanson, and so I will be. I
know by now that it is what you would like me to be. I believe
you will have here a very difficult time. I can see that your
gymnasium and your work in connection with it is going to be a
great success. Our town is just ready for such a thing. Ten years
ago, when I first came here, it was shut up inside itself; it had
changed very little, I fancy, in the last hundred years. But of
late many outside influences have attacked it, and there are many
people here who would push it and make it commercially
profitable, and there are others who would have it more gay and
up-to-date. They will all seize on such a man as you. You are
just the man for their purpose, and they will use you if they can
to their advantage. There is nothing wrong in that. This
gymnasium will be very good for them. But when it comes to the
other half of your project--your spiritual beauty, if that phrase
isn't offensive to you--then I fancy you are in for trouble.</p>

<p>"We are not bad people here, but, like people everywhere else,
we are lazy and selfish. The two hardest things in the world to
find are true altruism and honest clear thinking. If we all
thought more of the good of others than of ourselves, and if we
thought <i>straight</i> without allowing sentiment and
self-interest to confuse us, this world would be your beautiful
country to-morrow. But we are all afraid--you and I like the
rest--afraid of our safety, afraid that some one will rob us, or
laugh at us, or hurt us physically, or make us feel small. We are
not--most of us--cowards about big crises, but it is the little
things that destroy us. You have been given your vision clearly
at this moment. But later on--when you have built up a fine
business and discover that people will like you while you are
successful and don't interfere with their lives, but will hate
you if you try to change their comfort, their profit, their moral
code, their safety--will you see as clearly then?"</p>

<p>Johanson was gazing out of the window on to the marketplace.
"I don't know, sir," he answered gravely, "I have had a happy
life. I don't know how I would do when people did not like me. I
like them to like me. I want to be happy, and for them to be
happy. But I must see what I see," he cried, jumping up from his
chair, "I can see no other. I see the wide street and the noble
houses and the fine bodies of the people, and kind thoughts one
of another. Every one would wish that, sir." He turned to Wistons
pleadingly. "Seat any one in that chair and say to him, 'Do you
wish that?' and I don't hope he would say no. I must go on and
follow it as it comes to me."</p>

<p>Wistons stood up and held out his hand to him.</p>

<p>"I wish you good luck," he said. "If I can help you I will,
but I shall not be able to help you much. I fancy that you will
have to work alone. And if you are alone, think of Christ Who was
the loneliest of all. And on my side I shall like to think of
you. You will help me, give me courage. Well . . . good night.
Good night. Thank you. Thank you. Good night."</p>

<p>He turned, leaving the room abruptly, hurrying away with his
head bent, his long arms swinging. He looked back once, timidly
smiling, and was gone. Johanson stood at the window looking down
at the darkening Square but not seeing it.</p>

<p>He was wrapt in the future. It was as though the trumpets had
sounded for battle, afar off from the other side of the river,
but clear, challenging. He stood up, bracing his shoulders,
waiting for the attack.</p>

<h1><a name="c109">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<h1>MARY'S RETURN</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Every one in the house was astonished at the change in Maude
Penethen--every one save Reuben Fletch, and what he thought no
one save himself knew.</p>

<p>Maude was another creature.</p>

<p>She had no asperities, no conceits, no sudden tempers. She was
neither vain nor noisy. She thought of others. She was in love
with some one other than herself.</p>

<p>Even Miss Midgeley, who considered that she understood human
nature, was surprised. Still she did not trust Maude, but she was
compelled to admit that "if the girl remained like this very long
she would be forced to change her mind." Maude's beauty shone
through all the house. It had needed to be softened. Kindliness
had been missing in it, that it might shine like a lamp through
the texture of it. The lamp was lighted now and shone
steadily.</p>

<p>No one was more astonished than Mrs. Penethen. She had thought
that she knew her Maude. The best that she had hoped was that in
time, after constant companionship with that kindly, simple
creature, she would herself soften a little. But this instant
transformation! Something not put on--a sort of spring-cleaning
polish--but rather something that came from the girl's very heart
so that she was herself surprised by it, taken by an emotion so
new and overwhelming that she could only submit to it.</p>

<p>She did not "show off" her Harmer John as Mrs. Penethen had
expected that she would do, did not ask people in that they might
see what a capture she had made of this big clumsy giant, she so
small and delicate and he in her hands to be ordered whither she
pleased. She did not order him anywhere, but rather waited for
him. She was passive, expectant, altogether transformed by this
submission to another personality.</p>

<p>Only Harmer John was not astonished. As he had from the first
thought her very perfection, it was not odd to him that she
should be kind and unselfish and gentle. It was only odd to
him--astonishing indeed--that she, so beautiful and so perfect,
should care for him.</p>

<p>They did not see one another very often during the daytime.
Business was now coming to him in full flood, and she agreed
absolutely with him that he must neglect his work for nobody. She
was intensely ambitious for him, and the only impatience she ever
showed was in connection with his job. She was down in the
morning to see him off, she went sometimes with her mother to
fetch him in the afternoon. When the spring evenings with their
pale primrose light began to steal upon the town she walked with
him, strolling up the lanes above Orange Street.</p>

<p>But after supper was the best time. She sat very quietly in
the kitchen close to him, her hand in his, saying very little,
looking at him sometimes, meeting his eyes and holding them. She
busied herself about his clothes, mending his socks, sewing
buttons on his shirts. She liked best of all to be quiet, very
close to him, her body touching his, feeling his body through his
clothes, feeling the pulse beat in his hand against hers. It was
as though she were holding this moment like Joshua bidding the
sun stand still in its course, as though she had some forewarning
that just this moment was the best that she would ever have.</p>

<p>He loved her so terribly that it frightened Mrs. Penethen
sometimes to see the way that he looked at her, as though he drew
her in and in and in to himself, and then fiercely held her
against all possible challenge. But as yet there was no
challenge.</p>

<p>He was for ever buying her things, and such strange things,
not at all like the things that any one else would buy. Where on
earth did he find them? Maude liked what he bought for her
because she was in love with him, but had she not been in love
she would have preferred more ordinary things like necklaces of
pink coral or bright ribbons or pieces of lace. His engagement
ring for her was a funny old one of twisted silver, with a small
blue stone. He found her little silver boxes and old porcelain
figures, and an amber seal, and a silver dish and a print of a
ship in full sail, and a string of glass green beads, and a shawl
with roses. Where did he find them? Little old shops. They were
beautiful things, but people would think them odd. Now, because
Maude was in love, she did not mind that; had she not been in
love she would have thought them rather shabby.</p>

<p>He was extremely gentle with her, and she liked it best when
he put his arms around her and held her close to him; she could
feel his heart beating in the struggle that he was making not to
hold her closer to him and crush her. She would be crushed one
day; that was in the future.</p>

<p>She liked to put her hand up and stroke the back of his neck.
His skin was warm and smooth, and then just below the neck it was
cold and smoother yet, like marble. She laid her hand gently
against his cheek, and then she knew that he closed his eyes and
she could feel his hand clench around her.</p>

<p>He talked to her a great deal, but she did not listen very
much. She had never listened to what other people said, and she
could not, all in a moment, acquire that habit.</p>

<p>She sat, dreaming, beside him, hearing his voice very far away
beating through the beating of her own heart; it was her own
heart to which she was listening. She soon trained herself to say
"Yes" and "No" at the right places, and "Yes, that she agreed,"
or "Wasn't that interesting?" and "Just fancy!" Curiously,
although she was so ambitious for him and wanted him to be a
thunderous success, and that every one should be proud, yet she
was not interested to hear about his hopes, his dreams, his
schemes for the future. When he mentioned names, important names,
Canon Ronder, Wistons, Mrs. Bond, Ryle, Mrs. Combermere--she
listened greedily. When it was Tom Longstaffe or old Miss Eldred
she sank back into her trance-like lethargy.</p>

<p>And he poured out everything to her--to Mrs. Penethen and Judy
also. To Caesar the dog and also the cat. These were happy
evenings in the old high kitchen: the two lovers close, side by
side, Mrs. Penethen sewing at the table, Judy a book on her lap
but not reading, and sometimes Miss Midgeley.</p>

<p>He felt now that he was a member of the family, and so he
might tell them what he meant to do. But it was all in reality
for Maude; everything was for her. Only when he was caught into
the very heart of his dream, when he saw Polchester rising about
him, the Cathedral in its midst, beautiful streets with avenues
of trees spreading to the central Square, and there a wonderful
fountain, its waters sparkling in the blue air, happy people,
wonderful children . . . for the moment Maude was forgotten. No
dirt, no squalor, no unkindness. . . . Foolish words Maude
thought them when she caught a few, but she loved him, she loved
him. He would be a great man, the greatest man in the town. Even
Lady St. Leath . . . and she also had her dreams. . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They had in those first days only one quarrel, and that was a
little one.</p>

<p>One evening before supper Johanson, looking up at the gilt
cage and the nightingale drooping, said:</p>

<p>"I will let that bird go, Maude; you don't want it to be
unhappy. Birds in cages is like wrongly-married people. Maude,
let it go."</p>

<p>For a moment she was like the old Maude. "It was a present,"
she said quite fiercely.</p>

<p>Laughing, he went up to the cage. She sprang forward and
stopped him. "It's mine. Don't you touch it."</p>

<p>He saw that she was angry. The light left his eyes. He turned
away. "Well, if you like it. It's cruel, you know. How would you
wish it--to beat your hands again and again against the wire?
Always the same prison. But if you like it . . ."</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen, watching him, thought: "Ah, he can be
sulky--like an angry child."</p>

<p>Maude then was wonderful. She went up to him, pulled his head
down and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Of course you're right. It's horrid; I didn't see it that way
before." They went to the door together with the cage.</p>

<p>Hardly a quarrel.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He loved to tell them about his earlier life, days in
Stockholm and the Islands, Copenhagen and the long sea-shore.</p>

<p>He had a great gift for word-painting through his broken
English, English that now became with every week of his stay less
broken. He had imagination, and, through it, he could awaken
theirs.</p>

<p>The waters of Stockholm, the canals, the bridges, the sea; the
lights as they swim in a long amber chain over the dark water;
the ripples that the steamers made as they slipped like secret
messengers from landing to landing; the sudden avenues of dark
trees with the band playing; the light on the white walls and the
green trees and the blue water--no light and no water like that
anywhere else, except in Venice, maybe. He had heard that in
Venice . . .</p>

<p>And Stockholm drew near to his vision of his ideal town. They
were doing things there, men of our own time, beautiful
things.</p>

<p>But he had not been happy in Stockholm. He told them terrible
stories of how, when he had been a small boy, his mother and he
had waited in terror for the return of his father, waited in a
little grey flat right up in an immense grey building, and the
flat was so small and had so little air that it seemed like a
cage. They had heard the fumbling at the door, had seen the
handle turn, and then the big man with the black beard would come
in quite sober. That made it worse. He beat them out of cruelty.
He beat the small boy until the blood ran down his naked body,
while the mother, tied to the bed-post, hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>And then Harmer John grew too big to be beaten any longer.
That was a fine day when at last he defied his father and
liberated his mother. "Father and I was sort of friends after
that--friendly enemies; watching one the other like dogs. There
were an understanding between us."</p>

<p>The odd thing was that he, Harmer John, was happy through all
of that--some happiness deep inside that nothing could touch.
Life was too interesting for one to be unhappy.</p>

<p>"I can understand that," Mrs. Penethen remarked, biting off a
thread. "That's true what you say, Mr. Johnson. However deeply
you're touched, however sick in body you are, something remains
interested. I could read Marie Corelli if the house was on
fire."</p>

<p>Oh, novels! He didn't think much of novels. But pictures and
music, and the forest outside Stockholm and men unloading barges,
and little fruit and flower shops, and a funeral going into a
church with the door open and the lights over the altar, and two
strong men wrestling.</p>

<p>Then Maude, drawing him back, made him forget all these
things. It was one of his troubles that he had so much work to
do, but when he looked at her he forgot it, he forgot it all. He
had not known that love burnt like a fire. The heat, the heat and
then the chill, like fear!</p>

<p>One evening he was back earlier than usual, and washing his
hands in his room he heard a knock on the door. He said, "Come
in," and there was Maude. She had never before been in his room
while he was there. She stepped back. "Oh! I didn't know . . ."
she said.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, holding out his arms.</p>

<p>She came, and he held her to his breast. He sat down on the
bed, and she, on his knees, had her arms around his neck and her
cheek against his.</p>

<p>"Dear, I have wanted you so all day. All through my work you
was there, standing beside me, waiting for me. Oh, Maude, I have
never known that love was like this, never dreamt of it."</p>

<p>She was trembling and he held her closer as though defying
some enemy. The spring light, orange behind the window square,
made the chimneys and roofs black, and the sky was so pale that
it might not have existed had not one silver star given it life.
The room was dusk. Maude whispered, "I love you. I love you. I
love you. You are so strong that I don't think of myself any
more. Oh, why can't it always be like this?" she broke out
passionately, turning a little away from him. "It won't be! It
won't be! I won't be always like this, and I want to be. I'm
better so."</p>

<p>"But it shall always be like this," he answered her gently, "I
don't hope that we will ever change. I love you so that I can
never be another man. I know it, I have always known it. When
there was other women in Copenhagen I always shook my head
because something were missing. 'It isn't this time,' I said.
'Not yet. But it will come, and I will be patient and wait for
it.' And that first evening when you came in at once I knew--in
one moment for ever."</p>

<p>"You knew the first second you saw me?"</p>

<p>"I knew the first second I saw you. As I came in at the door I
saw you, the fire behind your hair. I don't hope there'll be
another moment in my life like that."</p>

<p>Maude sighed, nestling close to him again, her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"And there won't be another moment like that," she murmured
sleepily. "Oh, why does love start at the top and then it can
only go down? Now there'll be marriage and children and it will
all be common like other people. I'm selfish. I'll want my way
later when you are less wonderful." She had a vision of herself.
She shrank from it, creeping closer to him.</p>

<p>But he had no fear. "It shall grow more wonderful and more
wonderful as we know each other better and better, and our
children shall be beautiful, and when we are old we shall be so
happy looking back--"</p>

<p>But she closed his mouth with her hand. "Don't let us talk of
the future. It's now, now, now I want. Love me. Love me."</p>

<p>Their lips met. They had not kissed like that before. They
lost individual consciousness, all sense of time and place. They
were still, motionless, mouth pressed to mouth, as the light
faded and all the stars came out.</p>

<p>From an immense distance she heard his voice as though he were
conscious of some danger.</p>

<p>"Come down with me. The others--it is time."</p>

<p>But she held to him, her body quivering.</p>

<p>"No. Let us stay. A little longer."</p>

<p>"We must go down." He almost pushed her from him, then,
picking her up, carried her out of the room, his mouth buried in
her hair.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But his love did not cause him to forget his friends.
Something very important now was about to happen to Tom
Longstaffe--the return of his daughter and his grandson.</p>

<p>Now he could say to himself, "I have been given
everything--health, work, love and a friend." He trusted
Longstaffe absolutely, told him everything, would share with him
everything, would defend him anywhere, laughed with him, argued
with him, wanted him continually at his side, was always
wondering what he was doing, thought often how he might make him
happy, and all this he had in return. They were true friends.</p>

<p>On a certain day Mary with her boy would return to Polchester.
At first Johanson did not understand all that that would mean,
then he realised that Longstaffe was deeply apprehensive. Why?
What could there be to fear? They would be rude to her, perhaps
insulting, and then he, her father, would not be able to stand by
and see. . . . Rude to her? But why? Because she had had a child
out of wedlock. It was audacious of her to return. But that old
story? It had happened years ago. Every one had forgotten.
Forgotten? Wait and see, my friend. But Johanson in his fresh
enthusiasm about everything that had to do with Polchester could
not believe that any one in the place could be so narrow and so
cruel.</p>

<p>He reassured his friend, laughing at him, encouraging him.
Nevertheless some doubt crept into his own heart. There was even
perhaps something selfish in his feeling. Why was this girl
returning to disturb their friendship? She was very clever and
very learned, he had heard. He was terrified of clever women. Or
he thought so. It was true that he was not terrified of Miss
Midgeley, but then he <i>knew</i> her. Was he to lose all those
jolly times with Longstaffe, the evenings when he ran in on his
way from his work, the half-holidays when they walked their feet
off, the Sundays when they talked, their feet up on the fender?
There would always be this girl now. He shook his head, then
abused himself for a selfish brute. How happy Tom would be to
have his girl back again, to see his grandson tumbling about the
house, to hear the old rooms wake up and laugh and sing. He,
Johanson, with his own marvellous love-story, how could he resent
this piece of luck for his friend? Resent it? No. He was
delighted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless as the day approached he caught much of Tom
Longstaffe's nervousness. It was arranged that he should come
along about six o'clock. She was to arrive at the station about
five-thirty. Her father would meet her and bring her home.</p>

<p>That was an afternoon of pouring rain, and as Johanson turned
up Orange Street he thought to himself: "There's something wrong
about this. I feel badly about it. I believe something bad's
going to come of it." He opened the gate and crossed the sodden
lawn as though he were passing into some foreign country. Behind
him Orange Street was dimmed with drizzle; in front of him the
windows of the Rectory were blurred with rain.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and when the door was opened he could see at
once that the old housekeeper was in a quiver of excitement. She
glittered with her starched apron and cap, and whispered in a
voice hoarse with emotion, "She's here, Mr. Johanson, sir.
Lizzie's up taking the tea now."</p>

<p>He felt as though the house was new to him: he did not bound
up the stairs two steps at a time as was his usual habit, but
hung up his waterproof and cap, carefully straightened his tie in
the glass, passed his hand over the rebellious tuft at the back
of his head that would never lie down, and then slowly mounted.
At the turn of the stairs he almost crossed to the left, where
was the study, the accustomed den in the evening of the two
friends. But now it would be the drawing-room, that dim, yellow,
chilly room haunted by ghosts of old water-colours and faded
photographs. And with every step shyness gained upon him.</p>

<p>But when he opened the door he was at once surprised. The room
was bright and almost gay. A large fire was burning; there were
flowers in the vases, primroses and daffodils, and the tea table,
with its silver and hissing urn, was alive and friendly.</p>

<p>Seated there was a woman, Tom's daughter; standing in front of
the fire was Tom himself, and at the window, looking out at the
rain, was a small slight boy with a round head of jet-black
hair.</p>

<p>Mary Longstaffe had her back to Johanson, but at the sound of
the opening door she turned and then, seeing a stranger,
rose.</p>

<p>Tom came forward.</p>

<p>"Old man, this is my daughter. Mary, this is my friend, Mr.
Johanson, of whom I've told you."</p>

<p>She held out her hand and smiled. "How do you do? Father has
written about you so often in his letters that I feel as though I
know you quite well."</p>

<p>Her voice was soft and musical, and the grip of her hand
strong and honest, but at first he felt that he did not like her.
She was unlike her father in that she was largely built, broad,
Scandinavian in her very fair colouring, her round open face and
blue eyes; her hair was brushed back from her forehead and parted
down the middle. She was not handsome, but pleasant, frank,
friendly, a little masculine in her lack of subtlety and
coquetry, meeting him almost as man to man. He could admire her
health and strength, her fine colour, her honest sincere gaze,
but, dominated as he was just then by a type so opposite from
this in grace and delicacy and beauty, she seemed to him like one
of the women in his own country, a kind that he had known all his
life, women of the countryside, unsexual, uninteresting,
plain.</p>

<p>When the boy came forward it scarcely seemed possible that he
could be her son. He was dark and fragile, with close-cropped
hair, large black eyes and a small obstinate mouth. He was proper
boy, though, sturdy in spite of his delicate build, graceful in
spite of his sturdiness; he was quite self-possessed, giving his
hand, saying, "How do you do?" and making a funny little bob with
his head.</p>

<p>Johanson was uncomfortable, ill at ease; so also was Tom
Longstaffe. The girl and her son were perfectly possessed.</p>

<p>"I hope you've had a good journey," Johanson said, standing in
the middle of the room, which he seemed to fill.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thank you," she answered, smiling up at him. "How do
you like your tea? Strong? Weak? Milk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tea," he answered in a voice of disgust. "Oh, not for me,
Miss Longstaffe. I'm not keen at it, thank you. I've never tasted
any in all my life."</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>She began to talk, telling him about the little adventures in
the train--the old lady who would not have the windows open, and
the country-woman with the hen in a basket, and that wonderful
crossing of the river after Drymouth that must always bring a
lump into the throat of every Glebeshire native returning home.
This last might, in the especial circumstances of her return,
have hinted at awkwardness, but she showed no hesitation or
confusion. After a while she got up and put her hand through her
father's arm, and the two of them stood there together facing the
room.</p>

<p>That action roused in Johanson the oddest feeling of jealousy.
It was so, then. He was to lose his friend; no longer the two of
them together, but always this third. Nay, he would be the third.
He would not be needed any longer, and he would come there less
and less, and at last not at all.</p>

<p>Conversation flagged, and would perhaps have died, when the
boy turned round from the window and said, looking up at
Johanson:</p>

<p>"I've got a parrot!"</p>

<p>"Have you?" Johanson turned towards him, laughing. He would go
anywhere, do anything, for children and animals. "Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"It's not a she. It's a he. Mother, may I show this man my
parrot?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. Not just now. And you mustn't say 'this man,'
Billy. This is Mr. Johanson."</p>

<p>But he was paying no attention to his mother. He was gazing up
at Johanson with eager excitement, as though he were seeing him
now for the first time.</p>

<p>"Why, you're the highest man I've ever seen," he cried. "How
high are you?"</p>

<p>Johanson laughed. "How high do you think I am?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Billy answered, with a little swagger of
the body. "About eight feet."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not so much. And how high are you yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know"--dismissing himself before this superior
interest. "Do you think you could lift me with one hand?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>He bent down, very gently caught Billy by the slack of his
sailor trousers, then raised him slowly from the floor. He held
him high in air, then lowered him again. Billy, whose face while
this had been proceeding had been one of deep solemnity, was now
in a state of wild excitement.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried, stamping with his feet on the ground. "Did
you see that? He lifted me with one hand. He's terribly strong, I
expect. Can you lie down and have a cart and a horse on your
stomach?"</p>

<p>"I've never tried," answered Johanson gravely. "It needs
practice, I should think."</p>

<p>"Oh, you could! you could!" cried Billy, dancing about the
floor. "I'm sure you could. Will you take your things off and
show me your muscles?"</p>

<p>"Not just now," Johanson answered, laughing. "Sometime I
will."</p>

<p>"And I'll show you all my things. I've got a train and an
engine and a whole railway and a cricket-bat and a parrot. Will
you come now? They're all upstairs."</p>

<p>"Hush, Billy," his mother interrupted, "you mustn't bother Mr.
Johanson now. Some time he will, I'm sure. Besides, they're not
unpacked yet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are," Billy cried, tugging at Johanson's hand.
"Let's come and see! Oh, do let's!"</p>

<p>But they were prevented. The door opened and some one came
in.</p>

<p>Johanson knew at once who it was. It was Mrs. Bond. There is
something afterwards to be said of Mrs. Bond, who was at this
time a very important person in our town; for the moment there is
only her appearance as she stood there pausing in the doorway, so
pretty, so fragile, egg-shell china, her cheeks pink with
comfort, good living, and interest in her neighbours, her hair
steely-black and dress silver-grey, smart as we in our town
reckoned smartness, of the wider world, travelled, cosmopolitan,
eagerly friendly in the way of one who is being constantly a
friend to people to whom she is at heart indifferent.</p>

<p>She moved forward, not seeing Mary Longstaffe, and shook hands
with Tom.</p>

<p>"I came in only for a moment--" She had the prettiest voice,
and her eyes swam up to you as she spoke. Then she realised the
company.</p>

<p>"This is my daughter Mary, Mrs. Bond. She has just arrived.
You know Mr. Johanson, don't you? And this is my grandson
Billy."</p>

<p>She broke into rippling smiles. Then in a friendly, almost
beseeching movement, as she laid her hand on Mary's arm, looking
up at her:</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm so glad you've come. What happiness for your
father! . . . And this is your little boy? Mr. Johanson, how do
you do?"</p>

<p>They all sat down, and Mrs. Bond took the field. She had a
gift of conversation as no one in our town had ever had before
she came--something so accomplished, so widely travelled, so
informing without patronage, so gentle and yet so bold. She
seemed to the natives of Polchester to have been everywhere; she
was a widow and so a little sad, a mother of three boys and so a
little mature, and yet so gay and so young that her widowhood and
maturity were fantasies. She had seen all the world, and yet
preferred to live and die in Polchester which was flattering to
us. She had known French Presidents, had had tea with D'Annunzio,
and called on Bernhardt, and yet took an interest--a very keen
and active interest--in our little local affairs. She had charm
and tact, and smiled and laughed and declared that she loved
everybody and everything.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this was not one of her successful afternoons.
Billy was sent upstairs. Johanson sat there and said nothing.
Mary Longstaffe was not easy. At first, bathed by the cascades of
Mrs. Bond's laughing chatter, she passively accepted the shower.
Then, when she spoke, she was so quiet and gave so little
assistance that Mrs. Bond seemed, in a moment, to be left
deserted, naked and helpless beneath her own fountain of
words.</p>

<p>Tom tried to help, but he was embarrassed to-day, uneasy, shy.
Johanson tried to help. He began a long Copenhagen anecdote, but
his English was so slow, and every one knew what must be the
conclusions of his sentences long before they were reached.</p>

<p>Silence fell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bond's eyes, blue like very pale butterflies, danced all
over Mary Longstaffe. Up, down! Here, there! Then she rose.</p>

<p>"Well, this has been <i>delightful</i>," she said. "Tactless
as I always am, I came right in on your domestic scene. I don't
suppose you'll ever forgive me. Will you forgive me, you wicked
man?" She put her little hand on Tom Longstaffe's arm. He was
confused, murmured something. She turned to Mary. "I love your
father. He is the only good man I know. The only one. In Spain
once there was another. But he, alas . . ." She shook her head,
then brightened with a brave triumphant effort.</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me for loving your father, dear? You will
have to share him with a good many now, you know. I am so glad
you have come to make him happy. Good-bye, Mr. Johanson. You are
turning my boys into marvels of physical fitness. I am so
grateful. Good-bye. Good-bye. No, no, you are not to bother. I
can find my way perfectly."</p>

<p>But Tom Longstaffe did bother. Johanson and Mary were left
alone.</p>

<p>Mary smiled.</p>

<p>"She didn't ask me to go and see her," she said. "They won't,
you know."</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" he asked.</p>

<p>It seemed as though in a second they had become friends.</p>

<p>"For father's sake, yes. I want things to be easy for him.
He'll be hurt if they are rude to me. But I mean to stay, to make
my own life whatever they do. I won't slink away. This is Billy's
home where his father was, and this is <i>my</i> home where my
father is. I love every stick and stone here, Mr. Johanson. I've
dreamt about the river and the fields and the Cathedral for
years. They will like me to be back here if no one else will.
Does that sound sentimental to you?"</p>

<p>"No," Johanson answered. "I oft have such thoughts."</p>

<p>He was troubled. He saw that his town that he loved and
believed in would perhaps behave badly in this affair and so lose
some of its beauty. He did not want that to be. And he did not
want the girl to be hurt, nor Tom, nor the little boy. They must
not be hurt. He would protect them. But if his town was against
them, and then, because he protected them, was against him
too?</p>

<p>He moved across the floor towards her as though already the
attack were beginning.</p>

<h1><a name="c110">CHAPTER X</a></h1>

<h1>SEATOWN CAVES</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Looney One-Two-Three, no older now than he was forty years
ago, sat on the old green bench in the corner of the market-place
and frizzled in the sun. He was saying to himself, as he had been
saying now for forty years, "Something Strange and New is
coming," and his object was, as it had been for forty years, to
catch that Something. To catch it and then to do what with it? He
did not know. Like any wise man he would tell you when he caught
it.</p>

<p>He was a fine man, very thick and broad, with hair snow-white
(he had not worn a hat for forty years; he would make his catch
all the better without it). He was dressed as a fisherman in a
blue jersey and broad blue trousers, and he was dressed as a
fisherman because he was one. Before he had given up his life to
this catch of his he had been a very good fisherman at Propperty
Zezan-Tolooth. Then one night a storm had come crackling down
from the heavens, and ever since then he had given up catching
pilchard and such poor trash, and lain in wait for this other. He
had tried many a spot, but the best of all was just here, under
the wall of the Free Library, whence you could see right across
the shore to the line of breakers, and it was there that the sea
came pounding up from above the Seatown Caves.</p>

<p>It amused him greatly (people often asked him why he smiled so
much to himself) to see all the queer traffic that crossed that
shore--not the sort of traffic that you would see on most
sea-shores, but sheep and oxen, carts and barrows, shining bits
of furniture and plates and flower-pots, all spread out there on
the shore with the line of water held, gleaming, just under the
ridge of high cliff that stupid idiots said were houses. Houses!
As though he didn't know better! Houses! As though he couldn't
hear the sea pounding down below in Seatown Caves; as though he
couldn't see the glittering shine of the sea, held taut like a
string. But one day it would not be taut. It would come roaring
right across the shore, carrying the farmers' legs and the booths
and the cattle in a fine confusion with it--and then, on that
happy day, it would carry right to his feet that Something New
and Strange for which he was waiting. And wouldn't he collar it
then? It would be his, his own, his very own. No one else had
waited as he had done, day after day. That was why he smiled to
himself. Because he knew what was what.</p>

<p>He knew very well what the others would do if they found this
new thing. They would play with it and praise it and show it to
their friends, and be proud of it so long as it kept its proper
place and didn't put their other things out: if it did they would
throw it away. He would behave very differently. It should do
what it liked with him. He knew its value well enough. Everything
else should go--his seaman's chest, his baccy jar, his stuffed
parrot, his copper coins, his compass and his Bible. Yes, his
Bible too. He wouldn't want one when he had his treasure.</p>

<p>He felt as though to-day might be the day. There was something
in the air, a kind of smell, a kind of shine. The sun was so
powerful hot. He could feel it upon the smooth wall of his chest;
it crawled up his trouser legs, it patted his arms. He would
watch carefully to-day. This afternoon (the Cathedral had sounded
three o'clock) the market-place was deserted. He could see right
across to the line of thin white foam. At any moment the sea
might lurch forward and cast the thing, round, glittering,
golden, at his feet. He stroked his strong legs. He would watch .
. . He would watch . . . And so he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Not very far above his old white head, in a little room on the
first floor of the building that held the Free Library (given to
us in 1900), Cooper's Art Gallery and Dennison's Stores, Mr.
Temperly, the hairdresser's assistant, was also asleep, his pale
hands crossed over his thin chest and his shiny black hair
falling over his eyes. He too was dreaming of Something New and
Strange, and his Strangeness was a woman all thighs and
kindliness. There were no customers just then. Mr. Broadbent, his
master, was still at his dinner. He would be angry if he returned
and found Temperly sleeping: meanwhile the young man smiled and
raised one hand. But One-Two-Three was right. Did he catch his
Strangeness he would insist instantly on converting her into
Temperly, and if she would not be converted he would break her
and throw her away. But as yet he had not caught her.</p>

<p>To the right of him again, and on a floor yet higher, Mrs.
Brodribb, the wife of the dentist, was nodding over her novel.
The novel was entitled <i>Her Lover's Pride,</i> and between its
pages Mrs. Brodribb was finding <i>her</i> Strangeness, a
Strangeness to which Brodribb had not as yet introduced her. Her
fingers clutched at the vision. Lord Hartopp bent towards her,
his face all smiles. She turned to make him proper Brodribb--the
book fell with a clatter to the floor. She woke, and the vision
was departed.</p>

<p>Far to the right, again, Harmer John was holding his first
class of middle-aged men. The dark-blue blinds were half way down
the windows to keep away the sun, but patterns of colour lay
across the boards of the floor, and lozenges of light slipped up
the legs of the horse and fastened like leeches on to the
parallel bars. Above the patterns of light six men, four fat and
two lean, in their vests and trousers, bent and raised, grunted
and groaned.</p>

<p>It had been the idea of Mr. Cassidy, our leading grocer, only
a week ago. He had caught it from his boy, who, a day-boy at the
School, was a member of Johanson's gymnastic class, and was so
deeply enthusiastic that he had broken the washing jug in his
bedroom. Mr. Cassidy, a large, jolly, red-faced man, as all
grocers having to deal with delightful things like honey, dried
plums, figs, seed-cake and orange marmalade ought to be, caught
his son's enthusiasm, forgave the washing jug, and said to
Mildmay the auctioneer that very evening, "Why shouldn't we? Good
for us. I'm too fat and you're too fat. Puff and blow going
upstairs. He's a good fellow, that Swede. I'll speak to him." He
did, and here is the first class all puffing, bubbling, blowing
and happy with self-righteous approval.</p>

<p>Harmer John, in singlet and trousers, his neck and half his
chest and his arms bare, cracks out his commands, "One Two Three.
To the right. To the left. Now forward. Up again. To the left. To
the right. One Two Three."</p>

<p>He loved them as he looked at them. Not precisely as human
beings, but as fat to be reduced, knees to be straightened,
muscles to be developed, cheeks to be browned. Look at that
Cassidy with his belly! How was his heart going to stand all that
fat? And little Massing of the Post Office with legs like
matchwood, no chest, no shoulders, no anything but a wispy
moustache and an eager pathetic eye! And Carlyon the
nurseryman--a giant of a man and brown, healthy, clear-eyed! What
was he doing with that paunch and that double chin? The devil of
it was that he had so little time with them. As it was they had
squeezed this hour together with great difficulty! So busy they
were! And yet what did they do? With the exception of Carlyon,
spending their days behind counters, hiding in little
rabbit-holes totting up their money, hurrying home at night to
stuffy meals, stuffy rooms, stuffy beds. (This business of
sleeping two in a bed, how disgusting and insanitary!) If only he
could arouse them to the enthusiasm of five minutes in the
morning before the open window! But looking at them, at their
middle-aged solidities, he knew that it would be no easy task. He
must put some fire into them, some beautiful, cleansing, golden
fire that would burn away the dross, the fat, the sweat, the
accumulated laziness of years! His face glowed, his body moved in
beautiful rhythmic time with his orders, "One Two Three. One Two
Three. Forward. Now down. Up again . . . And now at rest! Mr.
Cassidy, you breathe only with your nose. Open your mouth. So.
Breathe! Breathe, man! So. That's better!"</p>

<p>The room was filled with friendliness and kindliness. As they
rested they felt their pleasure with themselves and with him.
They were stiff, they were hot, they were fatigued, but they were
alive. He was a good fellow, although a foreigner. And really
only half a foreigner. His mother had been an Englishwoman, and
he was engaged to a proper English girl. They looked on him with
approval. They admired the muscles of his arms and his great
chest. The strongest man they had ever seen and modest with it.
Liking the town. Best town he'd ever known, he said, although
he'd seen plenty of those foreign places. New ideas were good for
Polchester so long as you didn't upset everybody. And the
"Quality" liked him. The Cathedral people. For a foreigner he was
a remarkable man.</p>

<p>The hour was over. They put on the collars and coats. Better,
he told them, if they could bring special vest and trousers for
these exercises. Best of all to follow the exercises with a cold
shower. And then in the morning five minutes at the open window,
stripped. . . .</p>

<p>But they were not listening. They had done enough. They were
pleased with themselves and did not wish to feel that they had
any farther to go. But they had thoughts of forming a Club, a
Town Gymnastic Club. What did he think of the idea? Drill in the
evenings. Thirty, forty, fifty of them. He thought it a fine
idea, and that led him on to the expansion of his own premises.
He had thought of taking two much bigger rooms behind St. James's
Church in West Street. Mr. Fletch knew about them and thought he
could secure them. Not room enough here for the way things were
going. Well, good day, good day! Next Tuesday. Same time. Just
try five minutes before the open window . . .</p>

<p>He threw up the blind and the window and stood, looking on to
the sun-bathed Square. He was free for the remainder of the
afternoon. The Square was yet deserted save for old Looney
One-Two-Three staring there in front of him. Poor old Looney! And
yet not perhaps to be pitied! Always expecting something and
happy in his expectation. Was there any better state? But
happiness? Was there any one in the world so happy as he, Harmer
John? Maude, his work and the beauty there was in the world. And
this physical fitness running through him like some mysterious
stream of beatitude and comfort. He doubted nothing this
afternoon, neither his love nor his work nor his luck. This
blessed town and these blessed people. Their kindness and
generosity and simplicity. He was moving them all and yet without
preaching at them or trying to change them. Simply showing them
this good idea of theirs. And when he was married to Maude and
they had their little house and a baby or two. . . . What had he
done to deserve such happiness and such love? Wasn't it unfair
that he should have all the luck and the work that he liked and
the girl that he adored? He would make it up for the others, for
the less fortunate.</p>

<p>At the very thought, as though he had evoked her, one of the
less fortunate entered his vision. She was crossing the Square,
moving into the sunlight slowly, mournfully, with a dreary
purposelessness. Old Miss Eldred. He was conscious of a momentary
irritation, a tiny pebble of annoyance breaking the shining
surface of his pool of content. She moved across the Square
trailing an umbrella after her. She looked up at the sky as
though asking whether it were going to rain, the kind of thing
that on a beautiful stainless blue day like this she would do.
Then she trailed on, turning in melancholy fashion towards his
building. He moved, on an impulse too sharp to be resisted, into
the next room where Billy Trenant was scratching his round head
over some accounts.</p>

<p>"Billy, if Miss Eldred calls I'm not in, see?"</p>

<p>Billy grinned. "Thought t'would come to that," he said.</p>

<p>"No, it hasn't come to nothing. It's just that I'm busy."</p>

<p>He went back, closing the door behind him. In his imagination
he could see Miss Eldred, her old bonnet a little askew, her thin
lips tightly set, umbrella clutched in her hand, pausing at the
door downstairs, opening it, then slowly trailing upstairs. . . .
Why was he avoiding her? It was his first piece of cowardice.
Back at the window again he faced it. He knew that he had two
jobs on hand and that one of these was prospering marvellously
and the other was not prospering at all. The one that was
prospering was the practical one: for this he had, he saw quite
clearly, a positive genius. His arrangement of the different
classes, his organisation of his different publics, the School,
the Cathedral set, the town officials, the tradesmen, the
beginnings of his outside correspondence (exercises sent by post,
directions for fat reduction and so on), his individual cases for
massage like Ronder, all this work was successful beyond his most
ambitious hopes, and successful because his natural talent
stretched out into that direction so that he worked in that field
by intuition, by native instinct.</p>

<p>But behind this work lay another and strangely, obstinately,
almost against his will, of far greater importance than the
first. With the second work were embraced all his dreams, his
visions, his longings. Those dreams of his at night that were of
his very soul, those visions that sprang into full glory when he
stood beside the Brytte Monument in the Cathedral, those longings
that were all his inner life, his love for Maude, his worship of
beauty; a ladder that stretched from the blue plate in his
Copenhagen lodging to the full glory of Heaven.</p>

<p>It was this second work that was not progressing at all. Both
Shortt and Miss Eldred were failures. He had asked Shortt to draw
some pictures for him, his ideal street, his town with the
beautiful buildings, the avenues of noble trees, the fountains
and the Squares, and Shortt had produced mussy scribbles.</p>

<p>Moreover Shortt was always drunk.</p>

<p>He had suggested to Miss Eldred that she should, with his
help, start a small class of girls, a class to discuss the Arts,
to consider Italian painting and sculpture, but Miss Eldred had
done nothing at all. She only complained and protested. He
suspected that she also drank.</p>

<p>He knew that many people laughed at him for making any advance
towards such failures as Shortt and Miss Eldred, and he was
conscious that when his dreams moved him he became blinded about
people and judged them badly. He thought perhaps that he would
always be like that and would make the same mistakes in the
future, choosing the Eldreds and the Shortts all over again.</p>

<p>He saw, too, very clearly that in this second business of his
he would, as Wistons had warned him, have to pull down before he
could build up, and that, in pulling down, he would offend people
and would run into a new stream of contacts, many of them
hostile.</p>

<p>And yet, although he saw this too clearly, his Dream was, with
every new day, becoming more important to him than his
Business.</p>

<p>He did not, no indeed he did not, wish to improve people or
change them, but his fingers were itching to do things that would
prove to them, even on a tiny scale, how beautiful life might be.
It was not that people were lazy or wicked or selfish, but that
they simply had not <i>seen!</i> Their eyes were closed. He was
no better than they, but he had been given an opportunity of
<i>seeing.</i> He was sure that it was all so simple. A little
co-operation, a little comradeship with fun and goodwill, a
little throwing aside of personal interests, animosities,
rivalries and the thing was done. But where to begin? He could
not with his own hands pull down the hideous brewery at the
corner of Market Street, he could not go down to Seatown and . .
.</p>

<p>At the thought of Seatown he turned back from the window.
During all these months he had intended to go down to Seatown,
but every moment had been occupied. Now he had two clear hours.
He got his hat, called to Billy to close the place up and stamped
down the stairs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The market-place was busier now. Old looney One-Two-Three
still sat there staring before him. People moved in and out from
the dim arcades that were filled with plum-coloured shadows. Two
or three farmers, their stout legs apart, their hats tilted back
on their heads, discussed together. A nurse and a child dragging
a toy cart passed along. The warm day played on the dark surfaces
of the sleepy buildings.</p>

<p>Harmer John, moving slowly forward across the Square, could
not rid his mind of Miss Eldred. Anything more amateur than he
had been in his dealings with her and with Shortt too. (He did
not acknowledge to himself that Maude was influencing him.) Who
had ever heard of engaging a besotted drawing-master to make
plans of an ideal city! He should have engaged some capable
efficient architect. Capable efficient architect! The very words
cut his dreams into ribbons of air. It was because Shortt was
<i>not</i> efficient, because hehad also his dreams and visions,
that Johanson had chosen him. Yes, Shortt had had his dreams
once, but now so sodden, shiftless, mean had his life become that
his dreams, in sorrowful regret, had spread their wings and left
him. Dreams would not stay for ever.</p>

<p>He was thus thinking, looking neither to left nor right, when,
close beside St. James's Church, he ran into somebody. He stopped
abruptly, looked up, raised his hat. It was Mary Longstaffe. They
were in the shadow here, and the end of the houses beyond the
church ran forward, shutting them away from the market-place.
During these last days he had had so much upon his hands that he
had not thought of her. He had a sense of shame now because of
that. As he looked at her he again felt as though she were a
woman of his own country, flaxen, big-boned, upright, clear-eyed,
brave and--unromantic, unstirring.</p>

<p>She smiled, without shyness, honestly, as one man might greet
another.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Johanson," she said. "Isn't it lovely
weather?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He felt again that he liked her because she was
tranquil, calm, honest. She would give good advice, would be wise
and temperate in council. "How is the boy? I must come one day
and see his treasures."</p>

<p>"Oh, Billy!" She laughed. "You made a great effect on him the
other day. He is always speaking of you. He calls you the Giant.
Do come and see us one afternoon. We are both always in at
tea-time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will." He still held his hat in his hand. He looked
straight into her eyes, and she had a deep impression of his
honesty, just as he had had of hers. "I'm very busy and I like to
be that. I can't have too much work. I'm so keen at it that I
<i>never</i> can have enough to do. All the same," he looked at
her with a little perplexity, rubbing one hand through his hair,
"I want things to happen too quickly. Miss Longstaffe, why is it
you can't make people see what you see, at once--hey, crack
crack--just like that. We had in Stockholm an old clown at the
circus when I was a boy, and he went Hey, crack crack! like that
with his fingers and in a moment the girl on the white horse was
a princess in gold and silver. I'd like to do it too with a snap
of the fingers! Hey, crack crack! And all is beautiful and people
isn't fat any more, and no one--" He broke off. "I'm getting
preachy like a parson. And I hate preaching, but I've gone so far
I want to go farther, and it's the next step is so
difficult."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "But perhaps it wouldn't be good for you
if the next step were too easy. You'd get conceited. I'm getting
preachy too. How easy it is to be preachy if you have an idea
that obsesses you. Perhaps you shouldn't be afraid of being
preachy, but just go ahead. Risk everything. I'm all for risking!
We're all so afraid of everything! Why, before I came down here I
was afraid sometimes of whether the women would cut me. And now I
don't care--I don't care a little bit."</p>

<p>"But they're not cutting you?" he asked almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Oh no. Of course not!" She looked at him as though she dared
him to doubt her, then with a smile left him and went on her
way.</p>

<p>As he too went forward he thought of Mary Longstaffe, and
considered her with his own Maude. Strange that one woman should
move him not at all, and that the other with every glance should
so fire his senses! His senses! Yes, he was aware that with every
passing hour his love for Maude was growing. He must marry her
soon. She, too, was aware of that. Their contact now, were it
only the touch of hands, stirred with danger. He was unsteady
with the physical sense of her, and that physical sense seemed to
hang like a curtain of flame and smoke between his real spirit
and hers. It was her spirit that he loved, but, oh! he loved her
body too and he was afraid always now lest some movement, some
accident of privacy and juxtaposition, should be too strong for
them. A year ago he would have said that his control over his
body was such that no earthly power or temptation could shake it.
But now he was not sure. He had been so ignorant then of what
that blinding, deafening, all-consuming physical need could
be.</p>

<p>Old Miss Midgeley knew about this. She was his great confidant
now. He told her everything, and she understood marvellously. She
knew Maude too. He was not altogether blinded by his love. There
were things in Maude that seemed very odd to him, English things
he supposed them. Pruderies, conventions, superstitions,
prejudices. Pruderies in the very heart of her love, so that she
would astound him by her eager anxiety as to what neighbours
would say or think. She had little jealousies and rancours that
seemed to him altogether unworthy of her, and she had,
apparently, a positive hatred for her sister Judy. That strange
girl he did not pretend to fathom. She never said anything, only
looked oddly and cynically at them both, went about her household
work as though she scorned them all. He must confess that he did
not himself like her very much.</p>

<p>In fine, complications were beginning to arise around Harmer
John.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was plunging down now into Bridge Street. This was a lovely
afternoon, and if ever Seatown were to look its prettiest it
would be now. But it was impossible for Seatown to be pretty.
Once, perhaps, when a few cottages had nestled together at the
foot of the wooded hill and the Cathedral and Castle had towered
into air above them, when the Pol had run full flood and birds
had sung in the forest on the opposite hill. These days were long
departed, nor would they ever return.</p>

<p>Seatown had been for many a day the place of outlaws, nor were
these outlaws of the picturesque and romantic kind. Rather were
they the off-scourings of the district, loafers, idlers, thieves
and prostitutes. In 1902 a disturbance had been made, and it
seemed for a moment as though the whole place would be uprooted,
but other influences had prevailed, a few cottages at the far end
of Pennicent Street had been pulled down, and that was all.</p>

<p>Disturb Seatown and you stirred a nest of wasps. The foreign
strain always prevalent in Glebeshire blood was here paramount.
During that 1902 disturbance a mob of wild creatures had
penetrated the decent quarters of the town, threatening fire and
brimstone, swearing that they would burn down the Cathedral were
they not left alone, pulsing up to the very windows of Lord St.
Leath himself. And left alone they were. At once they settled
down to their old customs. To do them full justice, they did not
interfere with the rest of the town. They despised and scorned
their neighbours, kept their outlawry proudly before them, called
themselves descendants of kings and Vikings, and hummed busily in
their own hive. They are gone now, and their abiding-place with
them, and the man at this moment descending Bridge Street was the
prophet of their destruction.</p>

<p>The fine afternoon could do nothing for Bridge Street but make
its dirt and disorder the more apparent. The very fashion in
which the street tilted down to the river as though it had not
intended to go as far but had been too backboneless to stay its
impulse, gave a slipshod air to the uneven and awkward buildings.
Once there had been fine houses here--the doors and porticos
showed that--but now windows were broken, washing fluttered in
the sunny air, dirty unwashed children tumbled about the steps,
mongrels sniffed the gutters. As he proceeded Johanson's wonder
grew. He was entering into a new world, and a world for which he
was not prepared. He had on two occasions been half-way down
Bridge Street in search of somebody, but he had not realised
anything of this present degradation. He had seen, of course,
slums bad enough both in Stockholm and Copenhagen, and Nex&ouml;
has painted for all the world pictures of that jungle
civilisation. But those were big towns, marts for the world. The
whole of the present world must change before that wild garden of
despair and ruin could be uprooted. Here was another question.
Here was his own little town, the little place that he had taken
to his heart. Here, too, was something that <i>could</i> be
altered. The occupied space was so small, the souls concerned
comparatively so few. . . .</p>

<p>As he descended he had an odd sense that, like Wotan and Loge,
he was penetrating into some Nibelungen world. The air thickened,
life became furtive and mysterious, faces peered at him from
behind dark windows, dogs slipped by busy on furtive errands,
images leaning with waxen figures against the walls were
inhuman--of some other race than man. The bright blue air fell as
though through the opening of a vast encircling well. The sky was
brilliant overhead, but the sunlight shadowed and thickened as it
fell. He paused for a moment to gain some sense of the district
that he was reaching. Above him on the left an old Georgian house
with a carved doorway and two bow windows on its first floor
stretched heavenwards. Charming that house must once have been;
now it had fallen into slatternly and shabby habit. No sign of
life there. He looked up to two attic windows on the top floor.
High up. A superb view there. He did not know why he looked at
them, or why, having gazed, he earnestly read the number of the
house. One hundred and three, Bridge Street.</p>

<p>What told him that that house was to take its place so
prominently in later events? Enough that he knew.</p>

<p>But the silence! He would not have believed, had he not
witnessed, that so close to the market-place, St. James's Church,
the High Street, life could thus change its character.</p>

<p>Above his head they were standing in the sun on the market
cobbles discussing happily the world's affairs. Up the High
Street the Cathedral folk were passing to their tea, soon the
Cathedral bells would happily ring for Evensong, but here, as he
stood, the strange purple light enfolded him as though it were a
disease cloud descending from the heavens, as in some story that
he had somewhere read, to slay the world.</p>

<p>He passed onward and downward. Bridge Street fell into
Pennicent Street, the main thoroughfare of Seatown. This more
than Bridge Street had, in eighteenth-century days, known a gay
and polished life. The street ran beside the Pol and was bounded
from it only by a thin grey wall. The waters of the Pol ran
sluggishly, and with a strange blue iridescence. The houses were
reflected in that water, dark, at odd angles with strange marks
of personality, living and sinister things like the buildings in
a Meryon etching. Here were ruin and destruction indeed. Once,
maybe, these houses had had their gardens running to the river's
edge gay with flowers. Grubby remnants of gardens truncated by
the intersecting street remained, and in one there were even the
ruins of a sundial. Little alley-ways ran through the houses and
behind them. Beyond the open doorways dark passages gaped and
shaky wooden staircases could be discerned. Here, along Pennicent
Street, there was more life than in Bridge Street. The fine
afternoon called the people out, and, like figures painted on
some screen, they hung motionless against the stealthy
background, sitting on the river wall, on steps, leaning against
doors, or slipping in and out of passages. They stared at Harmer
John as he passed. Because of his height and breadth and swinging
walk he always commanded interest wherever he went. He turned
round once and smiled at two children, and they ran silently into
the house behind them. He spoke to a man leaning against a wall:
"A splendid day," he said, but the man gave him no answer, only
stared.</p>

<p>As he went anger rose in his heart, a strange confused anger
new to his experience. He hated and loathed this place, and he
hated and loathed the indifference of the people above them who
made this place possible. Those sleek overfed Canons and their
superior patronising women! Then he remembered that only an hour
or two before he had been loving these people and praising them
for their kindness; so then his anger swung round upon himself.
How was he better than they? he busied about his little selfish
money-making schemes, and he had been here for months and had not
even bothered to come near the place. As he smelt the smells, saw
the tattered rags that stuffed the windows, saw the filthy
children tumbling in the puddles with the mongrel dogs, there was
a great pain at his heart, a pain that in some way, instinctively
he knew, would never let him go again.</p>

<p>He had stopped, without definite consciousness, in front of a
building rather more tottery and damp-scarred than its
neighbours. Some impulse moved him to penetrate the black
passage, and then, scarcely conscious of his own movement, he
started to climb the rickety staircase. Here silence indeed
engulfed him. Almost frightened at the sound of his own footfall,
he paused. As he stayed there in that gathering dark it seemed to
him that if he moved higher he was taking a step that would
change all his future life. Should he go up or should he go down?
A fantastic fear held him; it was even as though some one laid a
hand on his coat and bade him descend.</p>

<p>So soon as he recognised this as fear, the choice was settled.
He moved forward, but, even as he moved, he knew that he had
taken some decisive step.</p>

<p>Reaching a landing, he found on his left a closed door. After
a moment's pause, moving still as though he were under the
direction of an outside power, he pushed it open and entered. A
room with some of the panes of the window broken, with a large
dirty bed covered with sacking and one thin torn sheet, a smaller
bed by the side of it in which a little girl was lying, some
broken chairs, some bottles, some dirty plates on a table that
had only three legs, a tall thin woman with a long pale face
standing by the end of the bed, her hand to her throat, her eyes
wide but not startled, all this he at once realised.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he said, taking off his hat. "I don't hope--"
Then he paused. What had he to say? For what reason was he
there?</p>

<p>The woman said nothing. She made no movement at all. He stood
beside the door, smiling. The room smelt musty, of unwashed
flesh, stale beer, cabbage, sickness, medicine, bad breath. The
sight of the child touched him instantly. He forgot the room, the
woman. He adored children always, one as another, good or wicked,
weak or strong, noisy or quiet. He went over to the small bed.
The little girl was perhaps five or six years of age. Her hair,
jet black, scattered the pillow; her face, tiny for her age, like
the face of a doll, was peaked with weariness and pain. She was
not asleep: her eyes moved drearily from right to left, from left
to right. He bent forward and picked her up, then, with almost
the same movement, wrapped the blanket about her, sat down on one
of the chairs and held her close to him, feeling the hot little
body through the thin nightdress. The child laid her head quite
naturally against his breast and her hand moved forward and
caught his. She thought perhaps that he was the doctor.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked the woman.</p>

<p>"It's 'er 'ead," the woman answered. "Terrible ache in 'er
'ead. The doctor can't do nothing. Says we came to 'im too late.
. . . She's dying. Poor worm too." The woman burst into low
passionate sobs. She still stared in front of her, but the tears
trickled down her face as though she were powerless to stop them
and did not care. She showed no surprise at his presence, nor at
his holding the child. It was as though she had known him
always.</p>

<p>Very gently he stroked the girl's forehead. Ever since he
could remember there had lain special power in the touch of his
hands. How many he had cured ere now of headache, neuralgia and
such ills! His hands were strong and gentle, but also something
emanated from him, something of his own strength and fortitude
and tenderness. The little girl moved at first restlessly; once
she looked up and stared into his face as though asking him a
question, then, with a deep sigh, she settled down in his arms.
His hand moved backwards and forwards across her forehead. He did
not speak, nor did the woman. She did not move. Over all the
house there stood silence. For a long time his hand moved, then,
the child deeply sleeping, he took her and laid her gently in the
bed.</p>

<p>The woman drew a deep breath. "She ain't slept, not to call it
sleeping, for days and days," she whispered, gazing down at the
child. She looked up at him, wonderingly.</p>

<p>He did not want to embarrass her. He would like to give her
money, but thought that she might be proud, so he only said:</p>

<p>"I shall look in to-morrow, shan't I?" He gave her a bow,
walked to the door, turned back once to look at the child and
went out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The little episode had relieved him for the moment of some of
his anger. He must have been in that room a long while; when he
was again in the street the sun had vanished behind the houses
and long amber shadows engulfed the distance.</p>

<p>Then, once more, looking about him his anger came full tide.
The dirt, the misery, the degradation! He stood, his legs apart,
his arms moving as though, like Samson, he would pull the whole
place about his ears, even though himself were crushed in the
ruins.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Johanson," a voice said in his ear. "Who
would expect to find you down here?"</p>

<p>It was Samuel Hogg. Not strange that it should be. Johanson
had had an odd sense for the last month or so that the man had an
eye on him, watched his movements, followed him, insisted on some
strange relationship with him. The very fact that this was the
only man in all the world whom he, Harmer John, hated gave their
relation some queer extra twist. A tie of melodrama, so that he
always saw Hogg as some one unreal, out of drawing. This meeting
now jerked his passion to a heat unusual to him. This man owned
most of these houses. It was due to him rather than to any other
that they were as they were.</p>

<p>"You've got a nice place down here," he said, turning round
upon him. "Charming place--healthy and with every modern
improvement. I congratulate you."</p>

<p>Hogg stood quite close to him, his hat tilted back on his
head, smiling friendlily and gently.</p>

<p>"Now, come," he said, "it isn't all mine, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't it?" Johanson was shaking with anger. "You've had
plenty to do with it though, with this dirt and ugliness and
smell. You're proud with it, are you not? You look at it and
smile and say: I'm a fine man, I! I make plenty of money from
their sores and sickness and tears. I'm a clever man, am I not? I
blind and deafen them up there in the Town Council so that they
don't enquire too much and too often, and I find a Canon or two
to buy a house or two, and then it all looks respectable. I have
the finest slum in all England, I have! the dirtiest and
smelliest and most dangerous, with disease so that all the
children dies and the dogs feed in the gutters. I are a splendid
man. Every one's keen at me. I will be decorated one day for the
fine things I do."</p>

<p>But Hogg was not at all annoyed. He looked at Johanson in the
friendliest fashion.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Mr. Johanson, don't get all worked up. And
take a word of advice from me. You've been abusing me, haven't
you, so you've given me the right in a kind of way to give you
some warning. You're a foreigner. You've been in this country
only a few months. Every one's been nice to you and likes what
you're doing for the town. Well and good. Well <i>and</i> good.
So long as you're dealing with what you understand, it's all very
handsome. You're good at the massage business. You understand
about it, which no one else in this place does, and it's good for
the town that you've come here. I'll grant you that. But you
don't understand everything, and my advice to you is to keep your
nose out of what don't concern you. You begin messing round here
and you're asking for trouble--"</p>

<p>"Trouble! Trouble!" Johanson broke in. "You dare to talk to me
of trouble and you let this go on, you make money of it,
you--"</p>

<p>"Very well--very well," interrupted Hogg patiently. "Grant
that I'm a scoundrel. By your beautiful lights I daresay I may
be. But I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking of
<i>yourself.</i> I'm in no danger that I need to worry about, but
<i>you</i> are. You start fussing round in places that aren't
your business and you see the sort of trouble you raise for
yourself! Lord! what do you know of English social conditions or
the way people live here or want to live? And you've got no poor
in your own beautiful country, I suppose? All Paradise there,
ain't it? I <i>don't</i> think."</p>

<p>Johanson answered more quietly. "You think you can frighten
me. You can't. You think I'm talking of things I don't know. It's
true I'm a foreigner, and it's true I don't know English social
conditions, but I know enough with my eyes to see this are wicked
and I'm going to make other people see too. And I say you are a
dirty scoundrel, because you see how filthy this is and encourage
it being filthy so you make more money out from it. That is the
foulest thing a man can do. Any man would feel the same as me if
he could see what I see, and so he <i>shall</i> see!"</p>

<p>Hogg stepped backwards. He stood, feet apart, his hands deep
in his trouser pockets.</p>

<p>"So you're going to down me, are you?" he said. "Well, Mr.
Preaching Parson, try it and see."</p>

<p>With a nod not unfriendly he strode off down the street.</p>

<h1><a name="c201">BOOK II</a></h1>

<h1>OF HOW HE STAYED WITH US</h1>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>

<h1>IN THE UPPER AIR--POPULARITY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The brotherhood of man might quickly be a realised happiness
were it not for the soil that divides us. In spite of the
timorous flatteries poured down upon the unbending head of Mother
Earth by apprehensive worshippers, the soil divides. We are
standing together, shoulder by shoulder, the view before us
superb, the sentiment in our hearts warm and comforting, when--a
sudden fissure at our feet, one of us tumbles in, the other
hurries to safety.</p>

<p>Who knows but that Looney himself and Mrs. Bond might have
been, years ago, twin brother and sister, had it not been for
that hissing whisper from the sky that made all the Mrs. Bonds in
the world in an instant meaningless? Other fish to fry. Meanwhile
she, unaware of any friendship averted by nature, deserves a
further word.</p>

<p>When she came to live in our town she came with the most
amiable intentions. She was a most amiable woman, amiable to
herself, amiable to others. With the double object of being kind
to herself and very friendly to every one else, she settled down
among us. She chose her home wisely. Her means were small. She
was a widow and had three sons, Horace, Wellesley and Joseph, to
educate.</p>

<p>In a larger town she might have slipped out of general notice;
in the country she would not have seen enough of her fellow human
beings whom she adored; she must be in some place where Horace,
Wellesley and Joseph could be educated adequately but
economically.</p>

<p>It shows, I think, how swiftly our town was advancing that
Mrs. Bond should so easily and with so many smiles of welcome
from her neighbours occupy the place taken only a few years
before by Ellen Stiles and a few others. When Archdeacon Brandon
was alive we were, socially, very small beer indeed. At the
little tea-parties and dinners given by our upper ten, when
scandal was talked at all it was scandal of a very local kind. We
scarcely glanced beyond the Polchester walls, and if London were
mentioned it was spoken of as a place remote and foreign. How
swiftly Mrs. Bond altered all that! She had travelled so much,
knew Europe so thoroughly and the East so charmingly that with
one turn of her beautiful hand she swung Polchester into the
centre of the Universe. "Pompeii!" she cried to timid Mrs. Ryle
at the very first tea-party that she attended. "You should see
Timgad!" (She was afterwards christened Timgad by her enemies.
Who in this censorious world has not a few?)</p>

<p>Consciously or unconsciously we all assisted in this splendid
attempt to push Polchester into the middle of Europe. One shove,
all together, one more, together again, and we had done it. There
Polchester is, somewhere nicely situated between Madrid and
Paris. But, once landed there, she had to be kept there, and the
only one of us who knew enough to carry <i>that</i> job through
sufficiently was, of course, Mrs. Bond.</p>

<p>It followed then, "as the night the day," that in no time at
all Mrs. Bond was the social leader of our town. She recognised
the position and most graciously accepted it. Her house (near the
bottom of Orange Street, just before you come to the river) was
tiny, and her means of course ridiculously small. (Had she not
three growing sons to educate, and were not investments always
descending, and could you have expected Mr. Bond, who had had
money in oil, to leave very much?) We never anticipated more than
a cup of tea or a sandwich in the evening as entertainment;
nevertheless her little dinner-parties were charming, and it was
she who introduced into our town the fashion of reducing dinners
to three courses, so much healthier for all of us. (As every one
knows, the custom is now universal.)</p>

<p>The most wonderful thing about Mrs. Bond was the way in which,
so swiftly, she had the whole of our town at her finger-ends, the
people, I mean, and what they were all about, who loved whom, and
hated whom too, why so-and-so was offended with so-and-so, and
why, if you didn't take care, you'd have so-and-so at so-and-so's
throat. . . . All about so-and-so, in fact.</p>

<p>Another wonderful thing was that she realised with astonishing
rapidity all our social grades and differences, recognised them
indeed a great deal more clearly than most of us ourselves had
hitherto done. In Brandon's time there had not been many social
differences: there was the Cathedral set, the Tradespeople, and
what Mrs. Combermere used to call the "Huggermuggers," she of
course declaring in her funny independent way that she liked the
Huggermuggers best.</p>

<p>But now, developing as we were, every kind of social
difference began to appear: Mrs. Bond had her little finger on
them all. Which of us, for instance, had clearly perceived in the
old days that Mrs. Ryle the Precentor's wife wasn't "quite
quite," and had indeed in her earliest time been, for a short
period, a governess? Mrs. Bond discovered this when she had only
been in our town a fortnight. Not that she disliked Mrs. Ryle.
She liked her immensely. She thought it a wicked shame that the
fact that she had once been a governess should influence anybody.
But there it was. Mrs. Bond wasn't going to allow it to influence
<i>her.</i> That it influenced certain other people less
high-minded than Mrs. Bond was, I am afraid, undeniable.</p>

<p>Then there was the question of the St. Leaths. Every one knew,
of course, that young Lady St. Leath didn't get on very well with
the old Dowager Countess. There was something to be said for both
of them. You couldn't expect the Dowager to be glad that her only
son had married the daughter of a man who had died in disgrace,
and the sister of a man who had married Samuel Hogg's daughter,
could you? On the other hand, it was scarcely the fault of dear
little Lady St. Leath, who was so modest and kind and
sweet-natured, that her family had behaved so badly.</p>

<p>But none of us had ever thought for a moment of interfering or
taking sides in the St. Leath affair until Mrs. Bond came along
and showed us that we really couldn't be indifferent to it all.
For her part she liked them both so much--the old Dowager and the
young Countess--that she was going to do her very best <i>not</i>
to take sides. Nevertheless . . .</p>

<p>I think that the Dowager and young Lady St. Leath were just
beginning to settle down together when Mrs. Bond came with her
European standards and showed them that it was impossible that
they should.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time Mrs. Bond knew every one in our
town and the private circumstances of every one. This last was
made easier for her by the willing co-operation and help of her
three sons. Horace was sixteen years of age, Wellesley thirteen,
and Joseph eleven. They were fat, pale-faced boys, curiously like
one another, and not very popular at the School, I believe. But
they were day-boys, and it is always difficult for day-boys to be
popular at a school that consists mainly of boarders. Undoubtedly
they were very useful in bringing home social news to their
mother, whom they loved dearly. They picked up so much that was
interesting from the other day-boys, and if they didn't actually
pick things up they invented them, which was almost as good. They
had very polite manners, and would sit for hours in a room
quietly just noticing things--so quietly indeed that you forgot
altogether they were there, which forgetfulness was sometimes
unfortunate in its results. Mrs. Bond adored her boys. She called
them her three jewels. They were all, she said, that she had now
to live for.</p>

<p>If you wished, at any time, to discover just what it was that
was occupying the Polchester mind, all that you had to do was to
drop in at one of Mrs. Bond's delicious little tea-parties. Here
you were most truly breathing "the Upper Air." Mrs. Bond was
careful whom she had to these intimacies--she chose her generals,
captains, lieutenants, with the greatest tact. Did you look in
you would be almost certain to find Julia Preston, a pretty but
not very intelligent lady, there. Then there would be, as likely
as not, Canon Bentinck-Major, smart, shining and worshipful; Mrs.
Hammersley, wife of our most prominent banker, one of the
Callender girls, and Colonel Cartwright, our leading
Conservative. These were Mrs. Bond's principal friends and
supporters. She had no enemies. "At least," she would say, "I
refuse to recognise any. If certain people don't like me it isn't
my fault, is it? I like every one in this town. I do indeed. Why
waste time and temper over hostilities? Yesterday some one told
me that Ellen Stiles couldn't abide me. 'My dear,' I answered,
'is that my fault?' I think Ellen is a perfect dear. Only the
other day I was defending her when Aggie Templar said that she
wouldn't have any more to do with her because she wouldn't pay
her card debts. Why, even if that were true . . ."</p>

<p>As I have said before, and as after events showed, it was a
thousand pities that we hadn't, all of us, Mrs. Bond's spirit of
charity and forgiving understanding.</p>

<p>Had you dropped in just now at one of Mrs. Bond's tea-parties
you would have discovered at once that Harmer John was the centre
of the town's observation. And you would have discovered another
thing--that every one loved him.</p>

<p>He had taken the town's fancy, and when any one takes our
town's fancy we are generous indeed.</p>

<p>He took our fancy the more securely because he took it
gradually. At first there had been the sight of him--his tall,
strong figure; his jolly, friendly countenance; then rumours of
his personality, his kindliness, simplicity, love for our town;
then a gradual interest in the work that he was doing.
Gymnastics, health, vigour and strength; then the recognition of
his social acceptance, giving Ronder massage, taken up by the
School; then real knowledge of the man himself; almost every one
met him. Because he was a foreigner and "different," room could
be made for him socially in every kind of way; then his
engagement to a girl of our town, his happiness at that, and
<i>our</i> happiness at seeing <i>him</i> happy (because truly at
heart we wanted nothing but to see every one happy). And then,
finally, the creation of this Legend, the first of the Harmer
John Legends. (It will be seen afterwards how many there have
been, and even until this day . . .)</p>

<p><i>This</i> was the Viking Legend. Straight from the icy North
he had come, clean and straight and strong like a sapling from
the northern frost. . . . And so on. And so on. The point was
that he should not be seen by any of us any longer as a human
being, but as a romantic illustration to some almost forgotten
fairy tale. Not <i>quite</i> forgotten. He brought back with him
our childhood again, those delightful days when, at our mother's
knee, we sat before a roaring fire. . . .</p>

<p>In Mrs. Bond's little orange drawing-room, Julia Preston,
gazing in front of her, balancing her tea-cup on the thinnest
bone of her very thin knee, whispered in reminiscent murmur:</p>

<p>"There was that story of Hans Andersen's, that <i>lovely</i>
story, about the forest and the man who cut down the trees. . . .
Oh, don't you remember, Beatrice (to Mrs. Hammersley)? I can't
remember it precisely, but I know there was a forest and that
splendid man. . . . When I saw him coming up the High Street this
morning swinging along in that fine way--"</p>

<p>"You're too romantic for anything, Julia dear," Mrs. Bond
interrupted. "The point really is that he is exactly what the
town wants. So long as he doesn't interfere with anything that
any one else is doing--"</p>

<p>"Is it true," asked Beatrice Hammersley, "that he's a close
friend of Mary Longstaffe's? That's a pity if it's true. I
haven't heard it on any good authority, only somebody said . .
."</p>

<p>"There," broke in Mrs. Bond, standing up in her indignation
and addressing them all, "isn't that exactly like this place? If
there's one thing that I detest it's scandal. Why need we be for
ever running others down and speaking of them uncharitably? Oh, I
don't mean you, Beatrice dear. I'm sure a warmer-hearted woman
never existed. But this is just another instance. Why, Mr.
Longstaffe was the first friend he made in the place! It's most
natural he should know the daughter. <i>I</i> don't think it odd
that he should have been there to meet her the first afternoon
she arrived."</p>

<p>"Was there when she arrived?" Julia Preston and Mrs.
Hammersley cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was there myself," Mrs. Bond rather reluctantly
admitted. "I'd no idea the girl was arriving just then. Went in
quite by chance--and who should be there but the girl, her small
boy, her father and Johanson. All most domestic. There are many
people who would think from that that he was being admitted much
too closely into the bosom of the family. It doesn't seem so to
me. He's engaged to that nice pretty girl at the place where he
lodges, and any one who says to me that there's anything between
him and Mary Longstaffe . . ."</p>

<p>"All the same," Mrs. Hammersley broke in, "it does seem a
pity. That nasty girl and that splendid man, especially as he's
engaged. I think that some one ought to say something to
him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammersley did not really <i>mean</i> that Mary
Longstaffe was a "nasty" girl. She was a large red-faced woman
brimming over with good nature, but she admired Mrs. Bond
immensely, was happy to be there in that intimate circle drinking
tea, and wished to take her part, to fit into the atmosphere, to
say something that would seem striking and pleasant. Mary
Longstaffe and Harmer John were both dim shadowy figures to her.
They did not cross her actual intimate world. She would have
faced the most fearful ostracism or deadliest isolation in
defence of her lean, bald-headed husband, her two bespectacled
little girls, or her old mother in Drymouth. But these distant
figures, why should she not toss them about a little if to do so
made her position more pleasant and assured round this charming
tea-table?</p>

<p>Canon Ronder was announced. Every one was delighted. The
moment that his friendly, beaming spectacles were seen, a
cosiness was added to the cosiness already present. He was given
the best chair. He smiled upon them all. He liked to be there.
They adored to have him.</p>

<p>"We are talking of your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Canon Ronder,"
Julia Preston said. "The Great Dane. The Viking. Harmer John, you
know."</p>

<p>Ronder was pleased. He wished that Harmer John should be
considered his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He had heard that Wistons
was taking him up. Just the way to ruin the fellow. Who had given
him his first private job? Who was always first in looking after
the town's real interests?</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you something about that," he said, beaming
round upon them all. "What do you say to a lecture from this
hero, or even two or three? A demonstration, you know, with some
of his ablest pupils. The suggestion has been made to him, and I
think something will come of it. He's such a modest fellow that
he needed some persuading, but when he was shown what a help such
a thing would be to the cause that he had at heart he gave in.
The affair is practically arranged. In the Town Hall about three
weeks from now, and I am to take the chair."</p>

<p>Now wasn't that splendid? Wasn't that the very thing? How
clever of Canon Ronder to have thought of it! A general sense of
the progressiveness of our town stole through the tea-scented
air. Who could say that we were not moving? Might not this man be
the talk of the County before long, and then, beyond the County,
of London, of England, of Europe? A general movement was made
towards Mrs. Bond, naturally able to estimate Europe's trend of
thought better than the rest of us.</p>

<p>"In Odessa I remember once when my husband and I were passing
through . . ." she contributed. Where exactly was Odessa? But it
did not matter. Odessa and Polchester met, hands clasped.</p>

<p>"He must be a remarkable sort of man," old Colonel Cartwright
said, stepping forward in his slow, cautious way. "Have you heard
the way they're talking about him down in Seatown? I'm told he
wandered down there the other day and into some rooms or other
and found a child dying there. Just put his hands on the child's
forehead and cured it. The women down there say he's a saint,
they tell me, and when he goes down, bring their babies and their
ailments, and one thing and another, just as though he were
Christ Himself."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's a pity," said Ronder gravely. "He must stick to
his job. He's just a fine young fellow who knows his work and is
full of enthusiasm for it. If they begin spoiling him and making
him theatrical it will be a thousand pities. I must speak to him
about it."</p>

<p>There was general agreement about this. We don't want him
spoilt, and we don't want him putting his nose into something
that he can't possibly understand. That's the worst of it; if
you're not an Englishman you never know where to stop. However,
he's young and unspoilt. A word from Canon Ronder. And
<i>what</i> a fine fellow! Straight from those northern mists,
those virgin forests, those untrodden snows. . . . The figure
rises, gigantic, God-like, higher and higher, above the tea-cups,
out over the house-tops, towering titanic above the Cathedral
roofs themselves.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At that very moment Johanson, in his shirt sleeves, was
leaning over the table in the outer office of his gymnasium,
reading from a book. He was bending down upon his straightened
arms as though he had been arrested by the sight of the open book
on the table as he was crossing to pick up his coat. His hair was
tousled, his face flushed. He had just ceased work. He was about
to close the place and go home. Old Billy Trenant was standing
there, looking up at him with exactly the expression of a dog
waiting for his master. With his short thick body, his stumpy
legs, his impertinent mouth and affectionate eyes, he resembled
precisely a Sealyham.</p>

<p>Johanson was reading:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Levin reloaded his gun and moved on, the sun had already
risen, although it was still invisible behind the clouds. The
moon had lost all its splendour and looked faint and pale; not a
single star could be seen. The puddles, that a short time ago had
looked silvery in the dew, were now golden. The grass too, that
had appeared bluish before, now assumed a yellow-green tint. The
swamp birds were chirping about in the bushes sparkling with dew
and casting long shadows. A hawk was sitting on a rick wagging
its head from side to side and looking discontentedly over the
marsh. Jackdaws were flying about in the meadow; a bare-footed
boy was leading the horses up to the old man, who raised himself
from under his coat and began scratching different parts of his
body. The smoke from the shot lay like a white mist on the green
grass. A boy came running towards Levin.</p>

<p>"There were wild ducks here yesterday!" he shouted from a
distance as he tried to catch him up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Johanson was savouring a moment of exquisite pleasure. He drew
a deep breath through his nostrils, raising his head, expanding
his chest. The book was open there by chance--<i>Anna
Karenina,</i> by Tolstoi. Miss Midgeley had lent it him. He had
not begun to read it yet; the volume had been lying on the table
there in the outside office and some one had opened it at that
place. He had caught sight of the open page as he was passing
through to get his coat, and he had stopped. He was caught
instantly away into that world that during the last two or three
months he had in some way lost. There again was the house, the
open rooms bathed in light, the silver birch, the faintly purple
sky, the Donatello "David" seen at the top of the gleaming
staircase . . . and with it all this Tolstoi country blended, the
bushes sparkling with dew, the bare-footed boy, the horses, the
smoke lying like a white mist. . . .</p>

<p>He straightened himself, looking about the room like a man in
a dream. "Ah, that's good!" he thought. "That life is mine. That
is very true life." And again, as so often before, he understood
that funny strawberry-faced old Miss Midgeley was always leading
him back into his true life, either by a book or a word or a
glance, as though she understood better than any one else in the
world what his life was. There were people like that, not at all
your most intimate friends, almost strangers to you perhaps, who
yet understood better than any one else what your life ought to
be and were always leading you back to it.</p>

<p>But, stretching his arms, feeling through all his body the
magnificent weariness of a well-spent day, above all scenting
ahead of him the exquisite joy that was in store for him (a joy
freshly renewed every day, kept suspended in front of him and
approached ever more closely as the afternoon advanced), his
evening meeting with Maude, he went up to Trenant, took him by
the shoulders and gently shook him. "I'm happy, Billy, terribly
happy. Is it dangerous, do you think?"</p>

<p>"You deserve to be happy," Billy answered, looking at him with
eyes full of pride. "You're a good man."</p>

<p>"Will you stick by me, Billy, whatever happens?"</p>

<p>"I'll never leave you," the old man answered, "'less you ask
me to. I've got terrible fond of you."</p>

<p>"You're an obstinate old devil," Johanson answered, "but I was
lucky to find you. Well, good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, sir," Billy answered, and turned about to put the
room straight before locking up.</p>

<p>Coming out of the building and into the market-place he
sniffed the evening air, loving its freshness, its scents of the
country town where, the business of the day over, the smell of
the fields, the woods, the hill, comes stepping lightly into the
streets, pressing up the stairway, threading through the windows.
How small and simple this place, but how lovable and friendly
with the greetings at the doorways, old Looney there on his faded
green bench, and the Cathedral bells singing the time through the
air as though especially for Harmer John going home from his
work.</p>

<p>He felt, as so often before, that he would yet further
postpone the glorious instant of that meeting with Maude; that
sight of her that always told him with a rush of sensuous triumph
that she was more wonderful than all his imagination of the
afternoon, stretching like a gorgeous tapestry behind his hard
and concentrated work, had assured him.</p>

<p>"I will go in for a moment to Tom's. The boy will just be
going to bed. He misses me if I don't come." He climbed Orange
Street, loving the English decorum of the old eighteenth-century
doors, the shining knockers, the neat propriety of the little
stone steps, the smiling pride of the gleaming professional
plates, doctors and lawyers and architects. "No streets like
these anywhere else in the world, and they are mine. Although I
am half a foreigner, England is mine. I belong to it and trust
it. It has given me my love and my Work, and in return I will
give it everything I have and am."</p>

<p>He opened the creaking gate and walked up the path. Soon he
was in the old house smelling the old smells of varnish and books
and geraniums and tobacco that seemed to speak to him with a
personal voice.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he called.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" came Mary Longstaffe's voice from upstairs.</p>

<p>Tom Longstaffe, puffing at his pipe, appeared at the doorway
of the study.</p>

<p>"Mary's upstairs bathing the kid," he cried, "I'll join you in
a minute."</p>

<p>He went up. He knew the way to the bathroom. The door was
open; Billy was in the bath sailing his boat; his mother, her
sleeves rolled up over her arms, was soaping his back. At sight
of his friend he jumped up, scattering the water, pushing his
mother back with his hand, standing waving his arms: "Mr.
Johnson! Mr. Johnson! I've got to ride you to bed, haven't I?
I've nearly finished. Oh, mother, that's soap enough. I'm clean
as clean. Mr. Johnson, I've got a dog. He's a Sealyham.
Grandfather's got him. He's down in the kitchen."</p>

<p>His voice, in his excitement, broke into a funny squeak: his
body shining in the light, the water running down his legs, his
black hair sticking up in little points made him seem a little
animal caught in the woods somewhere, quivering now with
life.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Longstaffe," Johanson said, "I don't hope
you mind my coming a moment."</p>

<p>She smiled as though they were very old friends. "Oh no," she
said, straightening herself, seeming very large in the little
room; "Billy would have been terribly disappointed if you hadn't
come. He always seems to expect you on bath nights." She sat
down, a towel on her lap, another over her arm. Billy climbed out
and stood between her knees.</p>

<p>He talked all the while as his mother dried him: "Mr. Johnson!
Mr. Johnson! the puppy's got a black eye. That's why grandfather
bought him, because of his black eye. Sealyhams oughtn't to, the
man said, and he isn't a proper Sealyham, but he's nearer that
than anything else. I'm going to teach him to walk and hunt and
everything, only the awful thing is," here his voice dropped to
great gravity, "that he likes the kitchen better than anywhere
and he hasn't got to. Mother says it's because he picks up
scraps, but I'm going to tie him to the leg of the dining-room
table when I'm not there. That's enough, mother. I'm dry now.
Yes, I really am. I'll do my ears myself. Mr. Johnson, I'm not
fat, am I? I haven't a bit of fat on my body, have I?"</p>

<p>He said it with so grown-up an air that they both laughed. He
turned round to Johanson, stretched out his arms, stood on his
toes, his face pursed up, anxiously, for approval. So he stood,
his perfect little naked body like a flower in its first bloom,
the skin rosy from his bath, the eyes of absolute innocence and
honesty, the head royally posed, the little muscles showing
beneath the soft skin. So he stood before life had written its
narrative upon him.</p>

<p>His mother threw his night-gown over his head; he wriggled
into it as a butterfly might waggle back into his chrysalis after
a moment's release.</p>

<p>"Now!" he cried, clapping his hands. Johanson bent down,
touching the floor with his fingers. Billy climbed on to his
back, fixing his arms around the thick, strong neck. Johanson
slowly rose and the ride upstairs began. Billy sat, his face lit
with a serious ecstasy, surveying the world from that great
height. All the world was now different to him--the tops of the
pictures, the corners under the ceiling, the funny sudden ending
of the wall-paper when its pattern was only half finished, the
great distance of the floor and the strange different pattern
that the carpet now made, the foreshortened furniture with dumpy
legs, but above all the pride, the adventure, the triumph at
being so high, at taking such risks, at the companionship with
the man whom already he admired more than any one else in the
world--all this was happiness and all this was the first promise
of that same spirit that was afterwards to lead him to such
splendid adventure and so glorious a death.</p>

<p>Up the narrow stairs they went, brushing the Caldecott
pictures as they went, along the passages lit now with the
evening sun; soon he was sinking, sinking; strong hands were
about his body holding him so firmly and yet so tenderly; he was
between the sheets gazing in silence at the ceiling.</p>

<p>In silence because it had been so great an experience. Then he
put up his arms, pulled down Johanson's head and kissed him. Then
he turned to the wall, sighed with happiness and almost at once,
like the animal that he was, was asleep.</p>

<p>They stood watching him for a moment, then went out into the
passage. "What do you think?" Johanson said as they walked
downstairs, "I'm to give a lecture, perhaps two or three. Canon
Ronder made the suggestion. He says people want it. I don't know
myself--what do you think?"</p>

<p>He was already feeling that this girl had more common sense
than any one else he knew. No, not more than old Miss Midgeley,
but common sense of a different sort, knowledge of the world. He
felt that she had suffered in the way that he would suffer if
Maude died or left him--suffer so that the wound would always be
there, not to make him misanthropic or cynical, but to change him
forever. So she was changed.</p>

<p>"I think it's a very good idea," she said, smiling up at her
father, who had joined them. "What will you do? Read them a paper
or just talk? Talking's better."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's one trouble," he said, "my English is so bad. I'm
shy to expose it. But I thought I would speak a little, and then
have some drilling exercises--four or five of us--and then speak
some more. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I think it's fine!" Tom Longstaffe cried eagerly. "Why,
you're becoming the most important man in the place, Johnnie. And
then you'll be so important that you'll be deserting us and going
up to London, and we'll never see you again."</p>

<p>"No, but you do think it's good, wise?" he asked earnestly,
turning round to her, his hand on her father's shoulder. "Not too
conceited, not too bold?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," she answered him confidently. "And you'll have
the great satisfaction of being sure that no one else in the
place knows anything about it. That's a great help, I'm sure,
when you're lecturing."</p>

<p>As he walked to his house he thought of the two of them
standing together in their doorway waving him good-bye. They were
wonderful friends. They would stand by him for ever whatever
happened. But why this eternal "whatever happened"? Into his
happiness for a moment a little chill foreboding fell. It was
because everything was prospering so that he feared. Not
entirely. He stopped for an instant under the monument of that
funny old frock-coated townsman to be honest with himself. It was
because he was keeping things away from himself, because he would
not face everything, Seatown and other things. He had been to
Seatown a number of times during the last weeks seeing that sick
child and--No, he would not! He gazed up at the evening sky with
almost passionate entreaty. This day must be splendid. He would
not make it miserable with thought of wrongs that he could not
cure. No, that he could not cure. Not now. Afterwards. Later.
Later. Later. Later. The sibilant trees seemed to whisper after
him down the lane.</p>

<p>Outside the door of the house, as once before on that stormy
night, he stopped, waiting, with a beating heart, as though he
were afraid of the joy that was to come. What if Maude were ill
or had been hurt in some accident, or were angry with him and
would not see him or--Laughing aloud at his own folly, he turned
the handle of the door and went in.</p>

<p>In the kitchen there was only Judy laying the table, gravely,
silently as always. She did not like him, he could tell that; but
to-night every one must like him, and, conscious that for another
moment he was extending that gorgeous heart-throbbing
anticipation of Maude, hanging up his coat he said to her:</p>

<p>"Well, Judy, how is it? All well although I'm away the whole
day? Bearing up?"</p>

<p>"You mean is Maude well?" she said, not looking at him.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I mean you--everybody. I love all of you."</p>

<p>"Yes, so you say."</p>

<p>"But I do." He went up to her, caught her head back and kissed
her. Her cheeks flamed, but she replied nothing until, standing
on the other side of the table, she said quietly:</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have done that, Mr. Johanson. It wasn't
kind."</p>

<p>He was distressed. In Denmark you kissed every girl, you
thought nothing about it at all; and she was Maude's sister. And
now he had made her unhappy.</p>

<p>"Ah, Judy," he said, "I'm to be your brother. We're brother
and sister almost already. I want you to be happy as I are
happy."</p>

<p>"Keep your kisses for Maude," she answered fiercely, "I don't
want them. And we're not brother and sister. You haven't married
Maude yet."</p>

<p>He looked at her with so kindly and friendly an expression
that she dropped her eyes as though she didn't wish to realise
that he could look at her so.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that's true. I've not married Maude yet. I'm
terribly sorry I've hurt your feelings, Judy. Why is it I'm
always wrong with you? If I'm keen at anybody or anything I don't
stop to think enough. People think longer in England than in most
countries. I'll be the same when I've been here a while."</p>

<p>Her hand trembled as she arranged some knives and forks. She
only said, looking up at him quickly:</p>

<p>"Here's Maude."</p>

<p>She came towards him wearing her hat and coat. "Let's go out,"
she said to him quickly. "There's twenty minutes before supper.
It's so close in here."</p>

<p>He took down his hat and they went out. They often did that
now--privacy was difficult in the house; but on such a purple
silver evening as this they could cut away, along the lane and
then through the wicket-gate to the left down the slope of the
field, through the hedge and up the hill on the other side, over
the very ground, had they but known it, once trodden so
disastrously by Brandon.</p>

<p>They had a favourite tree, old, thick, of multitudinous
branches, and under it on a warm evening they could sit, close
together, seeing the lights of the town come out, smelling the
evening scents of grass and flower, sometimes facing the orange
glow of sunset as it whirled across the sky.</p>

<p>To-night he knew, by the way that she clung to him, kissing
him again and again, stroking slowly his hair, thrusting her hand
in between his waistcoat and thin shirt above the beating of his
heart, that she was in a storm of love. Every throb of his blood
responded to her, but as he held her close to him with all the
strength that he could muster he controlled himself, feeling that
she was like some small lonely bird in his hands--the
nightingale, perhaps, that they had released--and that he must
keep her safe from all harm, must watch over her and guard
her.</p>

<p>Her cheek resting against his, she murmured, "I have wanted
you so to-day--oh, terribly! It was all I could do not to go to
the office to see whether you were still there. Yes, I felt this
morning that you had disappeared. Just as you came here that
night. You don't belong to us really--not to mother, nor me, nor
the town, nor any of us. You'll go one night just as you came. I
know you will. I know you will."</p>

<p>He held her closer and closer, her body in his hands as though
it were his body. But he felt a swift strange apprehension born
through her words. Was it so? Did he not belong here? Was this
place, this love, this work a dream, and was there some other
life waiting for him that would catch him back and awaken him to
reality?</p>

<p>No, his love for her was real enough. He knew it: it went far
beyond the desire of body for body, far beyond these embraces
that were only the feeble sign of its presence, deep into some
dark under-world of longing.</p>

<p>"We can never separate, you and I," he spoke to the pale
shadow of the sky, the dark curtain of the tree above their
heads. "If we were to quarrel, to separate, never meet in the
flesh again, I would still hold you, you will never be free of
me."</p>

<p>"But I don't want it like that," she answered. "Oh, Johnnie, I
want us to be married--soon, soon, soon. You aren't mine until
then; but when we are sleeping together, and when I can look up
and see you sleeping there beside me and know that the whole of
you is mine, that you aren't a ghost--"</p>

<p>"And when we have children," he broke in upon her gently.</p>

<p>"No, I'll be jealous of them. They'll take you from me, part
of you. I'll be jealous of anybody, anything--"</p>

<p>She drew herself away from him, resting her elbow on the
grass, looking up at him.</p>

<p>"Where were you to-night before you came home? You were later
than usual. I know. You went in to see those Longstaffes."</p>

<p>Her voice that had been soft was now sharp, a little shrill,
with a common Glebeshire tang in it.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "I looked in there for a moment."</p>

<p>She drew farther away from him.</p>

<p>"I knew it. You're always going in there. What can you see in
those people?"</p>

<p>He made no answer. She waited, then went on, her voice more
shrill. "I know what you see in them. It's that girl, that girl
that ought never to have shown her face in this town, bringing
back her baby and all. I--"</p>

<p>She broke off, aware perhaps of the speed with which they were
travelling away from their happiness of a few moments before. She
plucked at the grass.</p>

<p>He drew her back to him. Her body was at first stiff, then
yielded, and with a sigh she buried her face in his coat.</p>

<p>"Maude, Maude," he answered her gently, "you must trust me
more than that. You must know what my love for you are. There can
be nothing but trust when two people love one another as we. Tom
Longstaffe were my first friend, outside your house, in all this
place. He were the first to hold out his hand and take mine. I
don't hope you're jealous of Tom Longstaffe--" he laughed.</p>

<p>"No, not of him," she murmured, "but of the girl--"</p>

<p>"Then there is the boy," he went on, "the small boy. He is a
fine little boy, strong and brave, and until you give me some I
must have some children somewhere near. Always I had to have, in
Copenhagen, Stockholm, everywhere."</p>

<p>"But you'd give them up if I asked you?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"Give them up?" he asked. "How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If I said that I wouldn't marry you unless you gave them
up--"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you wouldn't," he answered her. "You couldn't. It
wouldn't be you. Another woman, yes. But I couldn't love another
woman while you live."</p>

<p>"But if I asked you to give her up?"</p>

<p>"Give her up? Miss Longstaffe? Yes, if I loved her. I would
see then that I must choose between you and her. But I don't love
her. I shall never love her. You don't understand, Maude, how my
love is for you. It is everything--all my body, soul, spirit.
While you live there will never be another woman. I have waited
for you all my life and now I have you. But I must be free too.
Not free to love other women, but to have my friends and my life.
And you must be free too, to have <i>your</i> life."</p>

<p>She realised that. He was just. She believed in what he
said--now. But later? She leaned up, drew his head down to her.
So they stayed for a while, then quietly walked down the
darkening fields towards the town.</p>

<h1><a name="c202">CHAPTER II</a></h1>

<h1>THE FIRST LECTURE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Three days later Maude went for a week to the little village
of Rafiel to stay with an aunt who was expected to leave
money.</p>

<p>Johanson wrote her five letters, and these are extracts:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR DEAREST BELUVEDEST DARLING--I am escaped the dull wether
its been since you left by a lot of work but I am thinking so
much of you and I hav had no word from you onely that line with
lov, I don't hope you're angry with me?</p>

<p>I am beginning to wok tomorrow for the lecture and every one
are so nice about it onely old Miss Eldred with complains over my
not giveing her more to do because I am always thinking of
myself. Well, I'm not are I, darling? It shall be fine for the
lecture, first I shal talk about thery and such things, not much
talking you know becaus my english is bad and then there will be
five of us--me, Walter Pearce, Harry Pearce, Franklin and my
young Trennent boy and we shall do all the exercises and the
pyramyd and everything. Then I shal talk some more and it will be
all over--one hour and a haf I think. I shal look forward darling
til your coming and seeing me mak my ecercises properly wich you

and I hop we shall spend a nice time together when you return. I
do love you so--I do--I love you for ever and ever and ever. A
great hug from your devoted luver,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">HJALMAR.     </p>

<p> </p>

<p>. . . Last night I could not sleep. It aren't like me at all
not to sleep but I wanted you so badly my darling. I walked down
and up my little room and thought of you and how you would be
sleeping and then of all the great towns in the world and not one
haveing any one so luvley as you and I sent you such heeps of lov
that I think you should have waked in your sleep and known what I
were thinking.</p>

thought your letter should hav been longer but it was very sweet
what it said and I lov you more with every breth I breath.--Your
adoring luver,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">HJALMAR.     </p>

<p> </p>

<p>. . . I were so tired yesterday with all the work for the
lecture and all the audinary work to that I com home an hour
erly. I read a book Miss Midgeley have given me, very fine,
<i>Anna Karenina,</i> by a Russian about marriage happy and
unhappy. I dont hope you shal be like Anna darling onely when I
am returning to wok when we are married you must not be dul
without me as she were without her husband that is the way for
married people to be unhappy with one another. There is another
man in the book Levin his name is and although he is a Russian
that dossent matter because he is like a brother to me. I feel
like he does about everything. Your mother have a cold and Judy
sulks she wont spik to any one and we doessent know what is the
matter.</p>

<p>Fletch is asking me about the new buildings I should hav will
I hav them and I said yes allthow I must borrow money from him
but I must have more room nau dont you think so darling? Your
mother is a wunderfull woman. I luv her allmost like you not
quiet but neerly. She is so quite but allways the same and we
understand one anuther wunderfull. You must forgiv my spelling
dearest onely english is not written as it is spokken is it. Your
muther dossent want me to tak the money from Fletch but what
shall I do? I must have more room and there is no other place
will do like these rooms in Market Street and I must hav them
from Fletch if I get them. What do you say darling? In your
letter you say you count the minites till you see me again and so
I do you. I am onely hoping we shal be married in two or three
munths I cant waite longer for you and these engagements are
cruel are not they when two people luv one another like you and
me. O darling com home, com home I ake and ake for you to hav you
in my arms and mak you happy with kisses and heer your voice and

<p align="RIGHT">HJALMAR.     </p>

<p> </p>

<p>. . . and the day after tomorrow you shall be home again. It
seems to mutch to beleeve. I am coming to the station although I
should not because of my wok. That goes splendidly and every one
seems keen at the lecture. In anuther day or more there will be
notices in the tawn about it and then they will buy tikets or I
hop so. Would not it be terrible darling if no one bought tikets
and onely a few friends came but I dont hope that and Cannon
Ronder says that every one are comming. I had a dream of you last
night singing in my garden not a garden you know of but one I
dream of and allways the same garden. You was never in it befor
but last night you were there singing in a tree and I could not
see you but you sang that you were allways there now and would
never leave me and that made me terrible happy. You told me once
that dreams were foolish but somtimes I am not certin which are
dreams and which are real. You are perhaps a dream what is truely
you I mean. . . . Com quick, I want you. I want you I must kiss
you soon. . . .</p>

<p>She returned, looking so lovely that he did not know why every
one in the street did not stand transfixed by her beauty. But
they did not; only old Looney sat motionless watching the sea
draw its crystal line up on the shore beneath the shaggy
rock.</p>

 GYMNASTIC PROFESSOR<br>
 (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Copenhagen),<br>
 ON<br>
 <i>Wednesday, May 22nd,</i> 1907,<br>

<p> </p>

<p>They were posted liberally. It was impossible to avoid
Johanson's name. He felt shy like a girl. He walked up the side
streets home.</p>

<p>Then four things occurred, all small things and all, for their
consequences, important.</p>

<p>First, he met Mrs. Bond in the street. She looked like a
flower, so dainty and fresh and dewy she was. She smiled--the
smile that has made people happy from Timgad to Beersheba. It
made Johanson happy; he was happy already because it was a fine
day and the tickets were selling so well for his lecture. He
looked down at her, and she looked up at him. She did not like
men who were too tall; that was something that she had against
him from the first.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Johnson, I am so glad to see you. I am coming to your
lecture, you know. I am looking forward to it so much."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It shall be very interesting."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it will be," she answered. (What a conceited man!
she thought.) "And so good for all of us. And oh, Mr. Johnson, my
boy Horace tells me that he is in your gymnastic class at school,
and he is enjoying it so much. I do hope he is good at his work
and improving."</p>

<p>Johanson should have been warned, but it was a beautiful day
and every one was smiling. Then he had never been a cautious man.
He hated the Bond boy; of all the boys in the class that was the
boy the most hated by him. The Bond boy was mean and false and
treacherous, trying always himself to avoid work and to fasten it
upon others. Yes, he hated the Bond boy, so, looking down upon
the smiling mother, he answered, "No, he doesn't work. I'm sorry
to say it, but he's the most lazy boy in the class. He's not keen
at his work at all and he's too fat, much too fat for his years.
White in the face too." And, having said this, he looked at Mrs.
Bond with the same friendliness as though he had said nothing at
all to wound her maternal heart. And she smiled back at him with
all the courtesy of a thousand European civilisations.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I must speak to him. He
didn't give me that impression; he seemed to be enjoying his work
so much. All my three boys are coming to your lecture and I'm
sure it will do them so much good. We <i>are</i> so looking
forward. . . . Good-bye. Good-bye--"</p>

<p>And that same afternoon she began her work, declaring at Mrs.
Ryle's, "I met that nice gymnastic man in the High Street this
afternoon, and I do like him so much. It's quite untrue that he's
getting swollen-headed, as people say, and the rest. People are
so unfair. Of course a foreigner has a different code of morals
altogether from ourselves. Nevertheless to say, as people do . .
."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The second thing that occurred was an impulse. He had an
amazing unexpected impulse to strangle Canon Ronder. He went, as
always, twice a week, to massage Ronder in his house. This deed
was executed in his bedroom. He did not like the Canon's bedroom
because it was, to his feeling, too effeminate. The curtains were
of old rose brocade, there was a piece of African silk on the
bed, a copy (a fine one) of Botticelli's "Primavera" over the
mantelpiece, a dressing-gown of dark brown silk over the back of
the chair. The Canon, during the massage, wore pyjamas of white
silk. There were flowers in the room, rose-coloured tulips, and
on the floor a thick purple-tinted Persian carpet. Too much silk,
too many colours, not enough windows open.</p>

<p>When the Canon lay on his bed (the African silk removed from
it), his pyjama jacket open, his skin was so fat and so smooth
and so white that Johanson felt, looking at him, a strange kind
of impropriety. He had not a hair on his chest, and without his
round spectacles his eyes were strange, cynical, sarcastic,
sensual. "He didn't ought to be a clergyman" had been Johanson's
first thought when he saw him naked, without his spectacles,
stretched upon his bed.</p>

<p>However, he had been to see him now on so many occasions that
he had lost some of his uneasiness, almost all of it. Then
to-day, unexpectedly, it came back to him and in great force.</p>

<p>"Turn over, please," and Ronder slowly, like some animal
rolling in a pool, turned over.</p>

<p>All this while Ronder, lying on his back, had been talking and
talking well. He had stared at the ceiling and from it had
extracted the true purpose of his discourse, which was as
follows: that by this time he and Johanson were friends--was it
not so? The town in general recognised this, and it was felt by
everybody that he and Johanson were working together for some
common purpose, and that purpose was the advancement of
Polchester.</p>

<p>Now, each had his own gifts, Ronder his and Johanson his.
Johanson knew so much that no one else in the town knew, but
Ronder was older, had more knowledge of the world and had more
knowledge especially of Polchester, its citizens, its classes and
divisions, its true needs. This lecture that was coming might be
taken as the first public step forward made by Ronder and
Johanson together. Would Johanson then be guided a little by
Ronder? This town was a queer one, odd in its prejudices,
superstitions, sudden resentments. One false step might ruin
everything.</p>

<p>Now--and Ronder, gazing at the snow-white ceiling, hoped that
Johanson would remember that he had not anywhere in the world a
better friend--would Johanson mind a little plain speaking? He,
Ronder, had heard one or two things. This was, like all small
towns, a terrible place for gossip, and Ronder had heard that
Johanson had been expressing in public his horrified surprise at
the state of things in Seatown. Of course, Seatown was not
perfect. Something had already been done and there were plans for
the future--well, Johanson might trust the Cathedral body to see
to the future. And was it really quite Johanson's place to meddle
in this matter? Wasn't he interfering a little in the province of
others? Did he understand sufficiently as yet English conditions?
He had heard that some hysterical women in Seatown had been
proclaiming Johanson as a kind of miracle-worker. That was a
dangerous mood if it went too far. Those people down in Seatown
had foreign blood in their veins--foreign blood, dangerous when
roused. And then another thing. Ronder did hope that Johanson did
not mind this friendly word. But was Johanson wise to make such
close friends just now of the Longstaffes? Excellent fellow, Tom
Longstaffe. One of the best clergymen in the whole diocese. But
Johanson, being a foreigner, did not in all probability quite
realise what English people felt about Miss Longstaffe's
behaviour. Poor girl! Ronder, who was a man of the world, could
see clearly enough the extenuation for her fault. But a fault it
was, a fault against God and the social laws of our country, and
she had been, beyond doubt, ill-advised to return with her child
to the place where it had occurred. He did not blame her; it was
natural enough that she should wish to be with her father, but
Johanson must remember that he was now beginning a splendid work
that might mean the happiness and well-being of many thousands of
human beings, and that he had but recently engaged himself to a
charming girl in the town, and that people <i>would</i> talk. . .
.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Johanson said, "Turn over,
please."</p>

<p>After Ronder turned over he had but little opportunity for
further advice. Johanson gave him that evening an excellent
massage. His white flesh crimsoned. His stout legs were bent
backwards, his thighs twisted, his arms stretched. Once or twice
he uttered little cries, he panted, he writhed. Once he half rose
in protest.</p>

<p>At the end he sat up, breathing very heavily. "Oh, dear one!"
he cried. "You did give me a pummelling!"</p>

<p>Johanson laughed. His round, boyish countenance expressed
nothing but happy friendliness. "If I hurt you--" he began. He
stopped and then added reflectively, "It won't last long."</p>

<p>"You didn't mind what I said, did you?" asked Ronder, feeling
for his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Not at all," laughed Johanson.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The third incident was brief.</p>

<p>One evening returning homewards, he ran into the Longstaffes
to tell them some agreeable news about the lecture's prospects.
The door was open. No one was in the hall. He called. There was
no answer. He crossed into the study and, knocking, entered.</p>

<p>Little Tom Longstaffe, his face puckered with distress, was
standing there. Mary Longstaffe, turning to leave the room,
almost ran into Johanson. She was crying.</p>

<p>He had seen her always strong, absolutely controlled, like a
man rather than a woman. This was a new figure revealed to him.
She brushed past him without speaking and left the room.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, what's this?" he cried. Then, as Longstaffe looked
at him in a kind of bewilderment as though he had not recognised
him, he went on quickly, "I'm sorry. I should not have come in.
I'll come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No," Longstaffe said, smiling through his trouble. "It's all
right. We're a bit upset. Only a letter a beastly woman's sent me
about Mary. I was a fool to press her for her reasons for giving
the church up. One ought always to leave people alone. But she
was one of the best workers we had--"</p>

<p>"About Mary?" Johanson asked. "What about Mary?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual thing. That until Mary leaves the place she
must give up coming to the church. That I ought to understand the
scandal it's making, and so on and so on. I didn't mean Mary to
see it, of course, but she opened it by mistake. And now she says
that she must go back to London, she and Billy, and the trouble
is that now I don't think I can get on without them. Having had
them here these weeks makes it so hard. And yet there's my work.
. . ."</p>

<p>Johanson breathed deep. "That's what this town is," he said
slowly. "After all these years they can so persecute you. . .
."</p>

<p>"It's right," Tom interrupted, "from their point of view. I
saw it, of course, from the very beginning. It's no animus
against Mary, but the thing she stands for. Forgive her and you
have to forgive so much. And they have children, girls of their
own."</p>

<p>Johanson was silent, thinking steadily.</p>

<p>"But not the cruelty," he said slowly. "Not the persecution.
And how can they judge? With their own faults. . . . Who is good
enough? It's blindness, dead blindness."</p>

<p>He looked so deeply distressed that Tom went up to him, drew
his arm through his and so stood close to him.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about our troubles," he said. "We'll see the
way through them."</p>

<p>"But I must worry," Johanson answered. "You're my friend."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tom answered, laughing. "But friendship doesn't involve
such burdens."</p>

<p>"It involves every burden," Johanson answered. "It were as
though it happens to me myself. I am you, you am I."</p>

<p>"Well, the sentiment's all right even though the grammar's a
bit mixed," said Tom. "It's something having you for a friend.
Yes, it <i>is</i> something."</p>

<p>Johanson turned away slowly.</p>

<p>"I must go to Mary," Tom said. "Come in to-morrow."</p>

<p>Johanson walked away, thinking deeply. For the first time he
had forgotten that Maude was waiting for him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The fourth incident was a dialogue, and it stepped, one spring
evening, out of the great West door of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>The shining stretch of grass was deserted. Perfect peace
rested there. No human soul to be seen until Ambrose Wistons
pushed back the leather flap of the door and emerged. A moment
later Johanson followed him.</p>

<p>For a second Johanson hesitated. It had been dark in the
Cathedral, a changing shadow of purple dusk. He had been
standing, as he loved to stand, before the Brytte Monument,
feeling that odd companionship with the young artist who preceded
him. Surely something there? Something stirring in the heart of
the grey stone seeking for his affection, wondering impatiently,
perhaps, why contact was not achieved more easily? Was it only
fancy bred of his love of the beauty of the brass and stone? or
was it that he had a friend here who was struggling to tell him
something that he should know? As the dusk fell closer about him
and he turned away, as he always did, with a sigh for something
baffled, bewildered, frustrated, was it only fancy that the ghost
of a sigh came to him across the evening air? At least, leaving
the great church, he was aware in his very heart of the
personality of that young artist taken away so early and yet
lingering so long. One beautiful conception, one fine thought,
one gracious kindliness--how interminably long these things
lasted, irritating all the cynical souls, exasperating those who
would see life truly as it is, encouraging the sentimentalists in
their false and cowardly dreams! Life as it is! How difficult! If
it would only stand still for one moment to allow one to survey
it properly. "Now, life! Stand still, can't you? How can I
photograph you if you are always moving?" Life as it isn't! Some
hope there. Daily bread for the poets at least.</p>

<p>But Johanson was not troubled. He took all the fish that came
into his net, threw back the small ones into the water again and
consumed the others. Cruel? If the position had been reversed he
would not have grudged the fish their meal.</p>

<p>Now, coming into the proper clear-minded air, he saw Wistons.
He had spoken to him only once since that conversation of theirs,
and that had been for a moment in Orange Street, courteous,
friendly, but with no contact. The man had warned him that there
could be no friendship with him, but it was not friendship that
Johanson needed. He admired this man as he admired no one else in
Polchester, coldly, perhaps impersonally, but with a certainty of
his courage and his passion for truth. He must speak to him even
though he were snubbed.</p>

<p>"Sir." He came up with him. Wistons stopped abruptly. "I beg
pardon, but it were such a lovely evening." He paused, fingering
his hat which he had taken off like an awkward boy.</p>

<p>Wistons turned and held out his hand. "I'm very glad to see
you, Mr. Johanson. I didn't know you were in the Cathedral."</p>

<p>They walked slowly together across the Green.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll forgive me," Johanson said, "but I couldn't
help speak to you. I think often of the talk we had. It helped me
so much and I thought I should tell you that."</p>

<p>"It helped me too," Wistons answered gravely. "How are you
getting along? I see you're giving a lecture. That's good. I'm
glad."</p>

<p>"You think it's good?" Johanson said eagerly. "I feared you
might feel it impertinent of me after being here so little a
time--"</p>

<p>"No, no. How could I? The more people that you can interest in
such things as bodily fitness and healthy exercise the
better."</p>

<p>"But it don't stop at that," Johanson went on still more
eagerly. "The body's so mixed with the rest. I'm beginning to
think of so many things, Mr. Wistons, that maybe isn't my
business at all, and yet if I stay with what <i>is</i> my
business I'm not comfortable. I'd wish not to think of the other
things, but they won't lie down."</p>

<p>Wistons turned to him almost angrily. "Why do you come to me?"
he asked. "When I can't help myself, how can I help others?"</p>

<p>They had stopped and stood looking at one another.</p>

<p>"Because," Johanson answered, "more than any other in this
town you care for the truth. Many questions are coming to me now,
Mr. Wistons, that never come to me before. Every day there are
more. They won't leave me alone. I wouldn't speak to you now, but
what you said the other day when we talked gave me
encouragement."</p>

<p>Wistons looked at him for a long time without speaking. Then
he said abruptly, "Will you come out to my house one evening,
after this lecture, and have supper with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I will."</p>

<p>"That's good. I'll write to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I'll be glad of it. Goodnight."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now it was the night of the lecture. Already by seven
o'clock there was a little crowd outside the Town Hall doors, for
the most part small inquisitive boys who climbed about the steps,
made faces at the statue of Sir Samuel Bowerman, M.P., to the
right of the door, and whistled and shouted until Perry, the
policeman, a splendid figure, advanced and rebuked them. Then,
his back turned, they triumphantly resumed.</p>

<p>It was the right kind of evening for the lecture, fine and
dry, but not too warm. We had not, in those pre-war years, had so
many lectures in Polchester that we could regard this one
indifferently. And this was an unusual lecture. We had had
nothing like it since Signor Della Rosa, the Strong Man, in '92.
So, by seven-thirty, there was a thick stream pouring through the
doors into the vestibule. Here you bought your tickets. The
unreserved tickets were the ones that sold. It was understood
that the "Quality" had bought all the reserved seats weeks ago,
and then when Tommy Probyn, a tall, haggard man, the owner of the
"Curio" shop near the Cathedral, who was superintending the
ticket selling, announced that this was not so, but that there
were three whole rows of reserved seats still for sale at only a
shilling more than the front unreserved, there was the trouble of
sitting with the "Quality," perhaps cheek by jowl with Mrs.
Combermere herself! No, happier in the balcony (front three rows,
1s. 6d., fourth and fifth rows, 1s., sixth and seventh, 6d.). The
sixth and seventh rows were very quickly filled, and by the rowdy
element. But the rowdies were to-night good-tempered; from the
very first you could tell that their strange cries, fragments of
song and violent whistling were all tuned to love and admiration.
Tonight at least they had come to praise Caesar not to bury
him.</p>

<p>In the two front rows of the balcony and in the middle part of
the hall were the decent people of the town. In the very front
row of the balcony were Mr. Cassidy with his family (Mrs.
Cassidy, three girls and one boy) and Mr. Mildmay with <i>his</i>
family (Mrs. Mildmay, ancient mother of Mrs. Mildmay, two girls,
one boy); and Cassidy and Mildmay, being founders, instigators,
leaders of the tradesman's gymnastic circle, felt that had it not
been for them Johanson would not exist. They, therefore, with
great dignity and benevolence prepared to enjoy their
evening.</p>

<p>Some trouble was caused by Mr. Shortt who arrived, having on
his arm a very ancient female in rusty black and a bonnet with
bugles, and enquired of Mr. Probyn for his two reserved tickets;
when given them he complained loudly because his seats were not
in the front row. He held up a tumultuous crowd of
fellow-citizens while he put his case; it seemed that both he and
the lady in bugles had been already celebrating the famous event.
It appeared that the front row was reserved for members of the
Cathedral body, and as soon as Mr. Shortt discovered this his
voice was raised in very violent complaint indeed. Who were the
Cathedral body? What had they done for Mr. Johanson or indeed for
any one in this town that they should be given the front seats?
Had not he, Mr. Shortt, been Johanson's first friend in this
place? Had not Mr. Johanson sent especially for him to help him
in his Italian art and reproduction of ancient masterpieces? And
had he not helped him? Had not he drawn some of the most
beautiful . . .</p>

<p>At this moment the voice of Mr. Perry, the policeman, could be
heard from somewhere in the back of the crowd making enquiries as
to who was obstructing. . . . Mr. Shortt's voice fell into
murmur; his arm was violently pulled by the old lady; he accepted
the seats offered to him.</p>

<p>The next excitement for everybody was the arrival of Mortimer
Shandon the Mayor. It was known that Mr. Shandon always
considered very seriously before he allowed the sunshine of his
presence to break out over any gathering. He took his duties as
Mayor with extreme seriousness. He was a large, heavy, solemn man
and was as clay, I am sorry to mention, in the hands of one or
two of his Town Councillors; Aaron Sharpe, Jim Curtis and Ben
Eagle may be named in this connection. He sailed up the middle
aisle, the black wings of his fine frock coat floating behind him
and his pale white-haired wife trying as ever to catch up with
him.</p>

<p>In his party to-night were Aaron Sharpe (thin, intellectual,
high-domed forehead) and Reuben Fletch. He nodded graciously to
favoured ones as he passed on his way. But scarcely had the
sensation of his arrival ruffled the waters of expectation than a
greater breeze arose. Who could this be but the Dowager-Countess
herself, and with her young Lord St. Leath and still younger Lady
St. Leath.</p>

<p>Like a splendid white cockatoo the Dowager pecked her way to
the front. Here was excitement indeed! How long was it since she
had last attended any town ceremony? <i>And</i> with her
daughter-in-law too! Was it true that they were for ever
quarrelling? No matter. She was a sweet little thing, young Lady
St. Leath. How pretty she looked in her dress of pale blue silk,
and how proud Johnny St. Leath seemed to be of her! It wasn't her
fault that her brother, etc. etc. etc. She was a good sort, she
was. No false pride about her! Our Town can praise nobly when it
pleases.</p>

<p>And then, as though they had all been waiting for the
Countess, in came the Quality. There was Mrs. Bentinck-Major and
there Julia Preston, there old Mrs. Combermere with her
walking-stick and there Ellen Stiles, sitting by all perverse
fortune next to Mrs. Bond and her three boys! And there the
Canons Foster and Martin, Bentinck-Major and Rogers, Ryle and
Ellis. So eager was the public interest in these public figures
that scarcely any attention was paid to Mrs. Penethen and her two
daughters Maude and Judy as they quietly found their way into
their seats in the middle of the room. And Maude was looking very
pretty too. She deserved <i>some</i> attention.</p>

<p>Notice was, however, taken of the entrance of Tom Longstaffe
and his daughter. Some cheek bringing his daughter out in public
with him like that! Wonder she didn't bring her child with her!
Great big woman! Ought to have known better. Didn't look as
though she minded either. All of which added to the general sense
of pleasurable excitement very greatly. Another figure, quite
unnoticed, was Samuel Hogg who stood, near the door, smiling in
his genial way upon everybody.</p>

<p>It struck eight o'clock, and, a moment later, Canon Ronder
appeared on the platform. How did he always work his miracle? How
did he contrive, so easily and with such ready grace, to throw
his spell over them all? In a moment of time he had the hall in
his hands. A smile, a little joke, an intimate allusion to
something known only among the townspeople, his voice cultured
but not superior, and the whole appearance of him so smart, so
bright, so kindly! No one in our town could approach him at
<i>this</i> game! No, and perhaps not in the whole world, thought
his old aunt sitting in the second row and watching him with eyes
loving but also cynical.</p>

<p>In five minutes he made the whole room feel that it was all
his doing that Johanson was there at all, and that it was the
very best thing for Polchester that Johanson <i>was</i> there. It
was as though he, Ronder, had gone out into the highways and
hedges of the world and had found, after infinite trouble, the
very thing that Polchester was needing. No one else in Polchester
had known--only Ronder. And he loved Polchester so dearly that no
trouble was too great for him did the town benefit from his
labours. And here, as many of them knew already, but as all of
them would know after tonight, was the best thing that Polchester
had ever had.</p>

<p>He stepped aside, looked towards the door and then, as
Johanson came in, waved his hand. His face was one happy beaming
smile.</p>

<p>The Hall broke into a roar of applause. It clapped again and
again. It cheered. The rowdies in the gallery stamped their
approval. A hush fell. Johanson stepped to the front of the
platform.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a singlet, white cotton trousers and white
shoes. His face, neck, shoulders, arms, were a dark red-brown. He
stood simply and quietly and, with a shy smile, explained that,
as many of them knew, he was not a very great speaker of English.
So he would speak slowly and he hoped clearly, but if any one in
the back of the hall could not hear, would he please call out and
say so.</p>

<p>And then some one cried from the gallery, "Aye, Harmer John,
we will"--at which every one laughed.</p>

<p>He explained then, slowly at first and afterwards with greater
confidence, what it was that he had come there that evening to
do. Some of the things that he said have become now such
commonplaces to every one throughout the world that it would be
very uninteresting to recapitulate them here. But at that time in
our town it was all new to us and had even a spice of adventure,
daring and almost impropriety in it. Johanson had on his right
hand a blackboard and over this he threw some charts. First, a
chart of the interior of the human body and a chart so decent and
proper that it was quite impossible to tell whether it were male
or female. Nevertheless this public exposure of the human
mechanism was something of a shock to one or two of our ladies.
Then he showed us muscles and nerves and arteries, all very
clearly and in a language that a child could understand--did, in
fact, understand, because Mrs. Bond's youngest boy was heard to
declare that "there was nothing new in all that stuff. He knew it
all by heart."</p>

<p>Then, putting aside his charts, Johanson explained that five
minutes a day, in the morning, before the open window would work
marvellous results. He showed what harm obesity could do to the
heart and enumerated the muscles that with most of us are never
exercised at all. Old stuff this! Yes, but not for us. We seemed
to be that night in the very vanguard of human progress. What if,
for an instant, a blinding vision of a new world flashed before
us? Before all of us--Ellen Stiles and old Shandon, Jim Curtis
and Mrs. Mildmay, poor, dear Ryle and ancient Alice Ronder--a new
world of giants and heroes, goddesses and angels? The vision
would pass and soon enough. We were not so mad as to hold it and
thus threaten our daily security. But, fleeing, it left something
in its train.</p>

<p>Having explained some very simple exercises with diagrams, he
paused.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, looking up at the ropes and rings that had
been slung from the ceiling, "myself and one or two friends shall
try and show you by exposition what I mean." He bowed. Frantic
applause. He retired to the back of the stage. He bowed again. A
little pause, and his companions entered--Walter Pearce, Harry
Pearce, Franklin and the Trenant boy. At the sight of these
well-known faces the Hall broke into renewed applause. These were
our own, our very own. Every one knew Walter and Harry, had known
them from birth, and their father, grandfathers and
great-grandfathers before them. Walter (working now in the Post
Office) was a short, thick-set youth with a round, brown face,
and of great strength. Harry was tall and slim, paler, more
graceful than his brother. Robin Franklin was a young-giant in
the coal business; of young Trenant, having been earlier
introduced in this chronicle, it is only necessary to say that
this was the proudest moment of his life.</p>

<p>They were all dressed like their master. First they went
through a drill of the exercises of which Johanson had been
speaking. I was not present on this now famous evening, but I
have been told by more than one surviving member of that audience
that at once every eye was fastened on Johanson. How is one to
peer, at this distance of time, through the mists of legend and
fable that surround his figure? Had he some miraculous gift of
grace and beauty of movement, something quite beyond his natural
strength and fitness? Would he, if one could see him now, rouse
in one that same sense of excitement and battle and mystery?
Himself, his character, his thoughts, the conflict that he raised
in our town, the picture seems to rise clearly enough before me.
No one simpler, more straightforward, more honest; those
qualities come clearly enough from every statement of every
observer. But this physical effect . . . of that there are a
thousand different reports. One saw this, another that, and
always perhaps they saw some aspect of themselves, hostile or
friendly. He antagonised, he attracted because of the response
that he roused. No one, through all this strange time, no one
from Looney to Wistons was indifferent to him; love, hatred,
confidence, scorn, the reaction always came. To-night, of course,
there was no hatred and when, at the last, the young men swung
through the rings and formed a pyramid on his support, the rhythm
and the grace were so perfect that every one in the hall jumped
up and applauded. His friends vanished and he stood once more
alone on the platform. He stood there for a moment
hesitating.</p>

<p>He did not look glad nor triumphant, but puzzled and
distressed. He wanted to say something. The words came to his
mouth and he forced them back. The pause was long-enough to be
awkward and make every one uncomfortable. Mrs. Bond said
afterwards that "really she did not know where to look."</p>

<p>Then quite abruptly he broke out, "Thank everybody for their
kindness," and with a sharp little bow turned and vanished.
Thunderous applause followed. There were repeated shouts from the
gallery: "Harmer John! Harmer John! Harmer John!"</p>

<p>He did not appear. The floor broke up into excited little
groups and, in the first enthusiasm for a remarkable experience,
social difficulties were forgotten. Something true and something
beautiful had been created there before their opening eyes, as
though it were a bud bursting into flower or a fountain
unexpectedly revealed, and they were triumphant and also a little
sad as though unforeseen truth had jostled settled conviction.
Mrs. Bond talked to Mrs. Tape of "The Cathedral Arms" with
charming friendliness. Young Lady St. Leath, her eyes lit with
pleasure and happiness, talked with the Precentor and little
Bentinck-Major. "But it was beautiful! beautiful!" she could be
heard crying. Every one lingered as though they expected
something more to occur. The room slowly cleared. Two old women
appeared with brushes. Perry could be seen, monumental, waiting
for emptiness and silence. Where was Johanson?</p>

<p>Would he not come round and join them there? They wanted to
congratulate him. Vaguely Mrs. Penethen, who knew him now, felt
that something was wrong. At the end his eyes had been fighting
something or somebody. She with her two daughters waited in the
vestibule of the hall. He had promised to escort them home. But
when they were in the house again he was not there.</p>

<p>He came in very late, and only Mrs. Penethen was up, reading.
She was going to speak to him, but when she saw his face she only
said "Good night," and when she heard his door close blew out the
lamp and went up herself to bed.</p>

<h1><a name="c203">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<h1>FROM GABRIELLE MIDGELEY'S DIARY--II</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>So many things interfere. For instance, I was getting on with
my work nicely last night, properly set, house all quiet about
me, my drop of whisky beside me and my head as busy as Mrs.
Jellaby's, when what must I do but leave the whole thing and work
for two hours or more at this diary? This entirely useless diary,
because no one will ever set eyes on it save myself, and although
it clears my brain, I suppose, of some tiresome stuff, more
tiresome stuff rushes in so quickly to fill up the empty spaces
that I am not, I fancy, very much benefited.</p>

<p>The truth is, I'm an old, brooding woman, and real life will
keep breaking in upon my attempted inventions. Not that I think
this book of mine to be bad: I would never have so nearly
finished it if I thought that. It's a nice, nasty, cynical,
bitter production, and I'm properly proud of it. It will make so
many people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the more cynical I am on paper, the more
sentimental does my daily life appear to be. That's perhaps true
of all cynical writers, and conversely I never knew a crueller,
more selfish or harder-hearted man than Stewart Frost, the author
of all those mystical sentimental Innisfree kind of books that
fluttered the '90 dovecotes.</p>

<p>I can look at myself quite honestly, of course, and say that I
am sentimental in one direction only, but then that direction
has, like the lean kine in the Testament, swallowed up all the
others. This Johanson? What am I to do with him? Am I in love
with him? No, that I can honestly say, I am not. Not that a woman
of my age might not be in love with a man of his if she wished.
It has happened often enough. But I know, by this time, what love
feels like, and I am not in love.</p>

<p>Nor have I the maternal feelings for him that Ma Penethen is
experiencing. I have no maternal feelings for anybody, not one
soul in this world. I never wanted a child from any man and I'm
happy to say I've never had one. No, I don't yearn over Johanson
as a mother at all. I've wanted to smack him often enough, but
that's been out of sheer irritation and exasperation.</p>

<p>I think friendship's the thing that I feel, a
well-wishing-God-be-with-you kind of friendship. Very much what
one man feels for another, I suppose. I like his brain although
it's only half awake and only a quarter educated. I like his
heart still better. That he has, and let us be quite
unsentimentally clear about it, the best, truest, soundest,
honestest, warmest heart of any human creature I have yet
encountered. And then I suppose there is just enough sex in the
thing for me to appreciate his strength and good looks. But
honestly they count very little. I don't want him to kiss me and
put his arm around me, and often I feel him much too big for my
little room. No, it's friendship, and when you see a friend
heading straight for disaster, you want to do something about it,
don't you? And yet is it disaster he's heading for? Is it not the
most brilliant success?</p>

<p>The principal fact just now is that he came back from his
undoubted triumph at the Town Hall a most unhappy man. I didn't
go to the lecture. I hate lectures anyway, and I suffer such
agonies when my friends make fools of themselves in public (as
they most of them in the old days used to) that I long ago
resolved to spare my feelings. My precious feelings would not, I
think, have been damaged on this occasion.</p>

<p>He had a most unquestioned success. The Town has been talking
of nothing else since, and every one is longing for the next one.
But the man himself is unhappy and dissatisfied as I have never
seen him before. He came up to my room yesterday evening after
supper and stood there fingering the things on my table in a
restless way that he has, which always drives me crazy.</p>

<p>So I told him to stop it and asked him straight out what was
the matter. Oh, he couldn't say. He roved restlessly about the
room. He was dissatisfied. Ashamed with himself. Ashamed with
himself? Good Heavens, why? Something he'd done--or rather
something he'd not done. He'd been a coward. A coward? (That
really surprised me.) How?</p>

<p>Oh, he'd liked the applause the other night and so he'd left
out the principal thing he'd meant to say lest he should make
them angry. That was cowardice of the worst sort.</p>

<p>Oh, I see! (I was very bitter here.) He'd wanted to preach to
them, to make them better. Well, if he wished for my opinion. . .
. No, he broke in upon me, I knew that it wasn't that. He didn't
want to preach to anybody. But what had he done? Nothing but
glorify himself. He had wanted to show them his idea of what life
might be, and instead he had pushed his body about like an
actress. All the applause had been for himself because he was
strong and knew his work. That wasn't what he wanted. That was
the wrong direction. He didn't want them to think of himself at
all, but of making their town beautiful and not to be cruel to
unfortunate people. . . . Preaching, preaching, preaching! I
broke in. I hate preaching. Leave people alone. Don't try to make
them better.</p>

<p>But he <i>wanted</i> to leave them alone. Couldn't I see that?
But he must put in front of them his idea--his idea, so easy, so
happy, if only a few would see it. But all he was doing now was
to glorify <i>himself. . . .</i> And there was Maude, angry
because he wouldn't give another demonstration next week, angry
because he wasn't proud of himself. Ah! Garibaldi, who went back
to the fields when the king came with his army, Levin, who was so
humble and so happy with humble men, what would they have said if
they had seen him the other evening, strutting about, pushing out
his chest, performing like a dancing bear. . . .</p>

<p>But next time he'd show them. Next lecture they should realise
what a filthy place Seatown was. . . .</p>

<p>He was more childish than I had ever seen him, child though he
always was. He wasn't far from tears, I believe. His anger with
himself was the motive of it all. He hadn't realised what a cheap
thing a public performance like that would be.</p>

<p>And he hadn't his earlier confidence in his dear beloved
Polchester any longer. He'd lost it. Of course, no one but the
na&iuml;vest of the na&iuml;ve would ever have had it. It wasn't
Polchester's fault that he fancied it perfect. God defend us
anyway from our idealistic friends! But he isn't blaming
Polchester--he only wants to make it see what a heaven-sent place
it might be. And how to make it see that without preaching to
it?</p>

<p>The foolish part of it is that I believe he's infected me with
his idea. Me! who am on the point of finishing a novel that for
bitterness and irony will give points to the bitter Maisie South
herself!</p>

<p>But when he talks to you, laugh at him though you may, there
is something in it. Three people, four people, five people . . .
find them and start your little crusade. Get them to find five
more people and those five five more again. How many people must
really see that the brewery beyond the Town Hall is hideous, that
Seatown is a disgrace, that cruelty at tea-parties is a crime as
bad as child-beating, that the detracting view of any one at most
is only half the view, that beauty grows and grows with what it
feeds on. One blue plate means one Persian rug, one Persian rug
means one good water-colour, one good water-colour means a new
wall-paper, one new wall-paper means a new view from the window.
. . . And why are we all standing still doing nothing, letting a
tiny minority do all the work?</p>

<p>And it is so fine after this string of platitudes to snuggle
down into my chair, pile up the fire and not care a twopenny damn
if every soul in this world suffers the torments of hell.</p>

<p>And what do I really care? Do I want to save the world or
improve it? Not, in my heart, one little bit. But I do care for
the man and I want him to be happy.</p>

<p>But his way would be easy and inevitable enough if it weren't
for his love of Maude. He'd just go the path of all fanatical
Quixotes. Preach a bit in the market-place, be kicked out of the
town (they can be a bit rough at times, my dear fellow-townsmen),
stumble on somewhere else, preach again, kicked out again, and so
go on to a dreary old age, dragging a few other fanatics with
him.</p>

<p>But he's not all fanatic; that's the trouble. And he knows it.
He's admirably practical at his own job, and if he'll only settle
down here now, go on with his work, fall in with the Ronders and
the rest, shut his eyes to Paradise, he'll make a very nice
little income for his dear little Maude and the results of their
devotion. He will have his work, and she the civic honours and
respect that she longs for. I'll do him the justice, however, to
say that if he didn't love her as he does there'd be no struggle
at all. He does love her with all the passion, sincerity and
worship that a physically vigorous man who has never been in love
before can feel. He adores her. He's not quite so blind to her
though as he was. There are things in her that worry him. She's
not so perfect as he first thought her, but he loves her all the
more for that. She needs protecting, advising, encouraging. He
wants to be her mother, her father, her brother, her sister, her
friend, her lover, her child and her comrade all in one. Lord!
why didn't any one ever love me like that? I'm worth a thousand
Maudes and always was. Just because I haven't yellow hair. The
fools men are!</p>

<p>Which brings me to Maude. She rushed in this morning. None of
that hanging about looking at me out of the corner of her eye
that she used to have! She doesn't know me any better than she
did nor love me any better either, she's still afraid of me, but
this affair has really shaken her right out of her selfish little
body. She does love him in her own shallow way and will even
continue to love him after all the intimacies of matrimony if
he'll only follow success, make money, get a position, keep his
fine friends.</p>

<p>But what's he after now? She simply can't understand it. She
rushed at me as though I were her only hope. "You, Miss Midgeley!
You understand him! You have more influence with him than any one
else! Talk to him! Find out what's the matter with him! Is he
crazy? Here he's just been and had the most wonderful success.
Every one's talking about him. Every one's praising him. And he
thinks it's a failure. What's the matter with him? Isn't this
what he wanted? Oh, Miss Midgeley, talk to him, talk to him!"</p>

<p>Dislike her as I do, I couldn't but be sorry for the poor
child. She was so helplessly bewildered. She was so proud of him.
I suppose she had never enjoyed a night in all her little life as
she did the other evening when she sat there and heard every one
from the Cockatoo Countess downwards praising her man. <i>Her</i>
man! HER man! It must have seemed like the reward of all her life
to her. And now it's all gone wrong. It's like finding your
milk's all sour or that you've had your purse stolen. And, I
repeat, she does love him in her own way. She does want to
understand him. "Tell me, Miss Midgeley, why he's like this?
What's disappointed him when it was all so splendid?"</p>

<p>And what, pray, is the use of my telling her anything? How is
she ever going to understand that he isn't thinking of himself in
this at all, or wouldn't be if he weren't in love with her, and
that he hadn't realised, until this public performance showed
him, that no one here cares about the thing he truly has at
heart. He's bothered by a dream, but what are dreams to Maude
unless they are dreams of his arms around her and his lips upon
hers? But I did try to tell her something, and the result was
even worse than I had expected.</p>

<p>I tried to show him to her a little as I saw him and, in
trying, I said something about his being a "stranger"--not only a
foreigner, but also some one, in his capacity for dreaming and
worrying about impossible unrealisable hopes, who would never be
entirely at home in a world which to commonplace people like
Maude and myself was always straightforward enough.</p>

<p>I could have said nothing more unfortunate. If terror is too
big a word, fright will do--and that was what came into Maude's
eyes. She knew that--she knew it a great deal better than I
could. It was his queerness--that was what she couldn't stand. He
talked about his dreams as though they were real: some place that
he went to in his sleep, a nasty place all empty and cold and
full of trees and statues. It was as real to him as Polchester
was; well, she called that "spooky" and she wasn't going to stand
it. After their marriage she'd put a stop to it. It was
indigestion as likely as not, but whatever it was she was not
going to stand it. Dreams were all nonsense, as every one
knew.</p>

<p>And it was just this dreaming that was standing in the way of
his getting on, as every one could see, and that horrid
Longstaffe woman, who should be ashamed to show her face instead
of flaunting about as she was doing, was just the one to
encourage him.</p>

<p>Now Maude was truly launched and revealed herself as the
little mean, selfish, cruel, greedy, vulgar, jealous egoist half
of her is. But only half of her. I'll do her that justice; and a
justice I wouldn't have done her half a year ago, because she at
an instant dropped Mary Longstaffe and her grievances and became
something very genuine, touching, and human. She spoke of her
love for him. She did love him, oh yes, she really did! "I know
you don't like me, Miss Midgeley--you never have and I don't
blame you in a way. Of course you think I'm not fit to clean his
boots. Oh! I know I've been a bit spoilt and made to think a lot
of myself. Loving him so has sort of made me see that--and then I
get tearing jealous when I could do anything--I'm so mad. And
then he's so irritating, not seeing which way his bread's
buttered, and how's he going to keep me after we're married and
children perhaps, if he hasn't got a good job and made friends
with the principal people. And they won't be his friends, Miss
Midgeley, if he goes preaching to them about what they ought to
do and how they ought to pull the town down and all the rest of
it. Such nonsense! As though he could know anything about it,
being a stranger and only here a few months. What is he, after
all, but a gymnastic instructor? He's got to keep his place, Miss
Midgeley, hasn't he, like anybody else?</p>

<p>"But, oh dear, I do love him! I do terribly. I just want us
both to be happy in a nice little house and every one liking him.
Because he <i>is</i> lovely! he is indeed. No one knows how good
he is!"</p>

<p>Thus Maude <i>loquitur.</i> Something touching about the
creature. And, oh dear, how pretty she looked as she stood there!
It isn't only her hair, although that's beautiful enough. It's
the daintiness of her, the perfect colouring, her lovely skin,
the absolute proportion of her little body, the animal grace of
her movements, her helplessness as though, if you deserted her,
nothing could save her from destruction. And yet any one less
helpless than Maude I have never known!</p>

<p>I did my best with her. What I tried to show her was that she
must stick to him whatever happened, even though he got whipped
out of the town without a rag to his back. That he was worth that
and ever so much more. But I could see that the very thought of
disgrace and unpopularity terrified her. That, I am convinced,
she'll never stand, and if that's the way he's going he'll lose
her. Lose her! Why not? She'll cheapen everything he believes in.
I've noticed in life that when two humans live together, one of
fine material and the other of base, there's never any doubt of
which way the issue goes. The baser metal always wins. There's
something bed-rock in complacent selfishness which nothing can
wear away. Yes, but on the other hand she's malleable. She does
see in a sort of way that this is the chance of a lifetime, that
she'll never get anything like it again, and that if she does let
jealousy and meanness and selfishness break in, she'll be doing
something she'll regret for ever. She sees that subjectively; it
pokes its head up and reminds her every once and again. But of
course her nature will be too strong for her and the only
question that truly remains is as to whether <i>his</i> nature
will be too strong for <i>him.</i> Will he give up his dreams and
lie down in Maude's bed never to rise from it again? That's the
point. There's the struggle and we'll see what we'll see. . .
.</p>

<p>. . . Such a tempest of rain and wind to-night like that night
when Johanson first came to us. He hasn't been in my mind the
last two days (the book has absorbed me--all my old excitement
returned for a wonder), but this morning when that strange girl
Judy came to dust my room she brought him back to mind again. And
that is a queer girl too--impossible to believe that she's
Maude's sister, as dark as the other's fair, as dry as the
other's talkative, industrious as the other's idle, as thoughtful
as the other's thoughtless. Thoughtful! yes, but about what? I
think she likes me in a kind of way. At any rate thinks I have
brains. I make her talk when I can.</p>

<p>I began this morning: "Well, Judy, what did <i>you</i> think
of the fine lecture the other evening?"</p>

<p>"What did I think?" She turned round fully upon me as though I
had challenged. "Oh, it was all right."</p>

<p>"All right? Most people had much more praise for it than
that," I answered, going on with my work.</p>

<p>"As to what they did," Judy continued, "I don't see there was
much in that. Why, the acrobats at the Fair in the summer do more
than they did."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the acrobats do things that no one else can do. The
point of Mr. Johanson's lecture was that he was showing people
things that they all could do if they liked, and be ever so much
the better for it."</p>

<p>Judy smiled, one of her grim smiles. "I'd like to see mother
and Mr. Hogg and Mrs. Cassidy doing those exercises he showed
us."</p>

<p>There was silence for a little. Then Judy turned, looking up
from her work, to me and said, "Don't you think, Miss Midgeley,
it was a pity his showing himself off like that? Seemed to
cheapen him somehow."</p>

<p>So she had felt that, felt what he did, felt it, maybe,
because he did. I could be sure that she was the sole creature in
the whole of Polchester who had realised it.</p>

<p>"I wasn't there," I answered quietly. "I don't go to lectures.
But many excellent people have given lectures. It's quite a
decent thing to do, I believe. Going to them--that's another
matter."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Midgeley." She said nothing for a little, then
began again: "But it's different showing off as he did. It's
silly of me, I know, but I couldn't help wishing he wouldn't. So
many strangers there, not knowing him as we do. He's too good for
that."</p>

<p>"So you think he's a fine man, Judy?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," she answered quite gravely. "Don't you think he
is? He's kind and generous and quiet. I like quiet men."</p>

<p>"Quiet? No, I hadn't thought of him as that. He's so cheerful.
Sometimes too noisy for my taste."</p>

<p>"But quiet inside, Miss Midgeley. Not always changing every
minute. You know where you are with him."</p>

<p>I saw in a flash that she loved him--loved him truly, deeply,
steadily as none of the rest of us in this house do. I had
perceived this, of course, long before. I have set it down, I
fancy, in this very diary. But I had not before perceived its
strength. His love for Maude--Judy's love for him--real love. Her
mother has that same steady strength, but she is beyond physical
love now, and the maternal is of another star, not a less lovely
one, but another.</p>

<p>And if Judy had had yellow hair?</p>

<p>She came to the table close to me, her thin pale plain face
all lit with the determination of her thought. "Miss Midgeley,"
she said, "you've travelled, you've lived in London, you've seen
the world. How would he be outside this little town? We have so
few strangers here. We can't compare him. But you've seen all
sorts. Would he be just ordinary in London? I suppose there are
lots of men who can do the things he does, many as kind, plenty
cleverer. Would he not be noticed in London?"</p>

<p>"He'd be noticed by some people," I answered her. "Perhaps not
by very many. There's not much time in London to notice
things."</p>

<p>She nodded her head. "If I knew him in London," she said,
"perhaps he'd need me more," and, a moment later, she left the
room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sitting here half dreaming, staring into my little fire, I
have a vision. Johanson and I are given leave to do what we will.
Together with eager hands we pull this place down. House after
house goes toppling. How we tear up the bricks, scattering them
over our shoulders! How we work, the sweat pouring into our eyes,
panting with our eagerness!</p>

<p>The place is empty, naked, void. A voice, shouting from the
skies, roars:</p>

<p>"NOW! CREATE!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LIFE AND DEATH OF A CRISIS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Four days after the lecture Johanson received this note:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p align="RIGHT">PYBUS ST. ANTHONY.</p>

<p>DEAR MR. JOHANSON--You will perhaps remember that you promised
me that you would come and have some supper with me one evening?
Would next Wednesday suit you? There is a convenient train that
leaves Polchester at 6.30, reaching here at 7. The Rectory is
easy to find, up the village street and to the left at the top of
the hill. I am looking forward to seeing you.--Yours truly,</p>

<p align="RIGHT">AMBROSE WISTONS.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He was surprised at his own pleasure at receiving this letter.
He had but just been through three of the most disturbed and
uneasy days of his life. His discomfort had been so sharply acute
that he had been utterly unlike himself, silent, morose,
preoccupied. And preoccupied with what? He did not know. With
something that stole like a dark cloud from the thin horizon
towards him.</p>

<p>But Wistons would resolve his trouble. He knew at once as he
saw that handwriting on that page that it would be so. The cloud
retreated. He was himself again. Then he was aware of Maude.</p>

<p>They had taken their evening walk, and now were under their
dark embosoming tree, upon whose thick texture the stars were
like silver buttons.</p>

<p>He kissed her as though he had found her again after a long
absence. She surrendered herself at first with that light sigh of
abandonment, as though this were the one moment for which she
lived, that he had come so especially to connect with her. Then
she seemed to recollect. She drew away from him, sitting back
against the broad wall of the tree, looking at him
critically.</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> been queer these last few days," she
said.</p>

<p>"Have I?" he said. He was lying full length on the grass. As
she looked her gaze altered, more intense, flooded with an
intensity of longing and passion and desire, a strange intensity
for Maude's light fickle eyes that were not meant to hold so
much. She bent forward and kissed him, first his mouth and then
his eyes. Afterwards, with a queer humility that he had never
seen in her before, she took his hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"I love you so much, and sometimes you're so queer and such a
stranger. What are you thinking of when your eyes are so far
away? You aren't seeing me at all. It's your silly old dreams. I
<i>hate</i> your dreams. They are what make you so queer."</p>

<p>He laughed again. "Why should you hate my dreams when you are
part of them?"</p>

<p>"I'm not part of them. I want to be part of them."</p>

<p>"You're part of everything that I am. You can't not be
whatever I am."</p>

<p>"I'm not yet. You haven't got me yet. Perhaps I'll marry some
one else."</p>

<p>She sprang up and stood, light-footed, fairy-shaped against
the giant tree.</p>

<p>"I'm free. I'm not any one's yet."</p>

<p>He leaned forward and caught her, held her between his hands,
then drew her down to him.</p>

<p>"You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. Don't pretend. You
know it. My heart is in your body and yours in mine. Come more
close, more close. Now are you mine? Have I caught you for always
. . . for ever?"</p>

<p>No one ever came that way. The silence was absolute, save that
once and again the leaves of the tree gave a little shiver of
exquisite comfort.</p>

<p>It was time to go. They rose and moved slowly down the field.
She was supremely happy. She felt her power. It seemed to her
that she could do anything with him that she pleased. She
scurried in her brain to find something. She knew that he did not
care for dancing. He had never yet taken her to a dance, so she
said:</p>

<p>"I want you to do something."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Promise me before I tell you."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. That never for anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must. It isn't something you'll mind."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"Promise me first."</p>

<p>"Maude, don't be so childish. Tell me what you want."</p>

<p>He knew that she was pouting, and he could feel her hand
stiffen against his arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're so fine with your words. You say you'll do
anything for me, but then when I ask you a little thing--"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't promise God Almighty anything without knowing it
first. That takes my freedom."</p>

<p>She was reassured. He still loved her best, better than any
one in the world. God couldn't get more from him than she
could.</p>

<p>She pressed tightly the muscles of his arm again: "I want you
to take me to a dance."</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. They were just entering the quiet and
deserted street.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? Why, of course, I will."</p>

<p>"But you don't like dances." Her triumph seemed too easy.</p>

<p>"No, but I'd do more than that if it gave you pleasure. When
is this dance?"</p>

<p>"It's next Wednesday. It's the Bible Class of St. John's."</p>

<p>"Why, of course--" He stopped. "Oh no, I can't. I'm terrible
sorry. I have an engagement that night."</p>

<p>"You can change it."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. It's important."</p>

<p>"More important than me." She drew her arm away, tossed her
head, walked faster, gaining a little on him.</p>

<p>He could change it, but he knew with an instant surprise that
he did not intend to. He had a reverence for Wistons that made it
seem an impertinence to bother him. He was obstinate too. He felt
that swift resentment at the interference of women in men's
affairs that every man born into this world has felt at one time
or another--and often felt with the woman he loves the most.</p>

<p>Her whole body was shaking with anger, and he knew that their
first real quarrel was upon them. He was desperately sorry; he
wanted to take her in his arms, stroke her hair and tell her how
sorry he was, but he would not change that engagement.</p>

<p>"You needn't hide who the engagement's with," she said. "I
know well enough. You needn't lie to me about it." Because he
never lied about anything, it gave her especial pleasure to say
that. She could the more admire his marvellous honesty, set up
like an altar in the middle of the jungle of hatred that she was
feeling.</p>

<p>"You know that I never lie," he answered quietly. "It is with
Mr. Wistons, the engagement. I am to go to supper there."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," she retorted. "You are going to that
woman." She had never ventured so far as this, she had never
loved him so much, and she had never felt such a delicious
excitement.</p>

<p>Jealousy was a human emotion that he had never known. He could
never have jealousy of another human being, because he believed
so intensely in liberty. If you loved another human being, how
could you take their freedom from them? They gave you as much as
they could, and you took that and treasured it. But the rest--if
you took it by threat and extortion and tyranny, how shameful you
must be.</p>

<p>But although he did not understand jealousy he did, because he
loved her so much, understand Maude. He caught up with her.</p>

<p>"Darling, don't be angry. I shall take you to one dance after
another, but Mr. Wistons is the man I have most reverence for in
the world. He's not my friend like Longstaffe, and if he were my
friend I would ask him to change the engagement, but we are not
on such terms. He is very good to give me an evening. I promised
him to go when he asked me. Now I have written and said I should
go that evening. I don't hope you shall be angry and make us both
so unhappy."</p>

<p>She turned on him a face under the lamp, cold, hard, gleaming
like a cut and sharpened stone.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have plenty of words. You can talk a lot, but when
it comes to doing something! You're selfish, that's what you are.
You never think of any one but yourself. And you're so stupid.
You're so simple. You don't care what people say about you or
what they think. You're engaged to me, but you go to that woman's
house every day, although she's had a baby when she wasn't
married, and you don't think of <i>me</i> and what people will
say--"</p>

<p>"Of what people will say?" he answered. "What does it matter
what people say if you haven't done wrong yourself? And they will
say anyway. Were you a saint from heaven come down to earth, they
should talk all the same."</p>

<p>"Yes, you mayn't care, but what about me? Am I not to
mind?"</p>

<p>They were close to their door. He stopped her, put his arms
about her.</p>

<p>"Maude, darling, we must each of us have some freedom, and we
must trust one another. The Longstaffes are my friends; I can't
be unkind to them or disloyal. You have friends I don't like,
Hogg, for an example. But you must have your freedom too. Only
while we trust one another we can have our freedom. If the trust
goes, then the freedom goes with it, but if the trust goes, then
we are no more together. If we don't trust we don't love."</p>

<p>She turned from his embrace.</p>

<p>"Will you give that woman up? Will you promise never to see
her again?"Her voice shook, quivering with the intensity of her
feeling.</p>

<p>"But, Maude dear, I can't. Her father's my true friend. I love
him and would never give him up for anybody."</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking of him. I'm speaking of her."</p>

<p>"But he loves her. I couldn't give her up without leaving him
too."</p>

<p>"Then you won't?"</p>

<p>"Give up my friend? No. Never."</p>

<p>"Then it's over. Do you see?" With a trembling hand she opened
the door. "I don't love you. I hate you. It's all over, I tell
you."</p>

<p>The door was banged. He stood there, his heart aching for love
of her; he had never before felt so tenderly about her. But his
purpose did not change and he knew that it would not.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Next day they were reconciled. It had been their first quarrel
and it was over, but everything was not quite as it had been. Her
power over him had been questioned; she would not rest now until
she had completely asserted it. To assert your power completely
over another human being is to condemn two souls to permanent
imprisonment.</p>

<p>He felt the change in their relation, and it was with a heavy
heart that he set off for Pybus St. Anthony. He was experiencing
that loneliness belonging to lovers who are too confident. We are
so close together that not God Himself can separate us--one body,
soul and spirit. Then, in a moment of time, a word, a phrase
pokes up its ugly face and there is no relationship at
all--strangers in a strange place.</p>

<p>As he walked down the long Polchester platform to find the
little local train, lonely by itself like a poor relation, his
love for Maude constricted his heart, hurting him physically. She
seemed to accompany him down the platform, treading lightly at
his side, and saying to him again and again: "Am I not worth
everything? Is there anything of more value than me? Surrender
yourself. Will you give me up for a shadow?"</p>

<p>As he climbed into the stuffy, tight little compartment he
knew that the crisis of all his life had climbed in with him. He
had, in fact, never known any crisis before. Life had been
direct. First there had been his mother to protect, and he had
protected her; then there had been his father to fight, and he
had fought him; then there had been his living to earn, and he
had earned it; then there had been his work to love, and he had
loved it. It was when the other loves had come to him that the
struggle had begun, love of beauty, love for his friend and love
for a woman.</p>

<p>As he sat there and saw the little fields, brilliantly lit by
the evening sun, the hedges like wet lines of paint, the cottages
so characteristic of Glebeshire in their isolated defiant
pastures, his heart ached as though he were saying farewell to it
all. And yet he could formulate nothing. His problem was a wood
in front of him, into whose heart he had not yet penetrated. He
knew that Wistons would help him.</p>

<p>He was the only traveller to alight at Pybus St. Anthony. The
little village was dead and bright like a picked bone as he
walked up the sunny hill. Maude was still with him, walking
beside him and saying, "Am I not of more value . . . ?"</p>

<p>He turned to the left at the top of the hill, walked down a
little by-road; he opened a white gate sorely in need of paint,
pushed up a weed-stained drive and saw the Rectory, bare,
four-square, unadorned, impersonal. When the old Glebeshire
servant answered his ring and he stood in the hall he felt as
though nothing had been done to this house for ever and ever. And
it did not care that anything should be done. If help were
offered it would refuse it. The pictures would fall from the
walls, the fresh wall-paper wither, the stair-rods trip the
unwary. Everywhere was the proud spirit of resistance. The old
servant ushered Johanson into Wistons' study. It was exactly as
he had anticipated it--absolutely spare, distempered white, a
table, a crucifix, a photograph of Leonardo's "Last Supper," a
wall of grimy and dishevelled books.</p>

<p>Wistons looked pleased to see his visitor. For the first time
in their acquaintance there was something warm in his greeting.
They talked a little, trivially, and very soon went into the
other room for supper.</p>

<p>Wistons did not apologise for the food which was bad--poorly
cooked turbot, cold beef and hard potatoes that clung sullenly to
their jackets, apple tart with pastry of lead. Wistons did not
apologise, and Johanson did not consider it. He ate heartily and
happily. His mind had cleared. His depression had retreated like
a defeated enemy. They achieved during the meal that relationship
that was to last to the end. It was not so personal as
friendship; it was rather the frank intimacy of two human beings
who recognise in one another those two great qualities, reality
and honesty. Whatever the future might bring they would always
meet with interest and, cataloguing in their minds the true human
beings they had known, they would remember one another.</p>

<p>After supper they went out into the little garden. The moon
was a sickle of apricot, the scent of the flowers lay thickly on
the evening air, peace flowed like a river down the hill. They
sat on two old shabby garden chairs and Johanson faced his
problem.</p>

<p>"I must settle it now," he said, leaning forward, and staring
at the sky that flowed above the sharp wall of the garden like a
stream of pale lemon-coloured water. Tiny clouds of gold moved on
a faint wind. Wistons, a true observer of men, studied his face
as he talked. Although it had in the curve of the mouth and the
determination of the chin a man's character, its roundness, the
simplicity of the blue directness of the eyes, the buoyancy of
the brow, had still the happy unclouded kindliness of the boy who
has not yet learnt to distrust.</p>

<p>The brows drew together in perplexity as a boy's might.
Wistons knew that the man was face to face with the first real
trouble of his life. "I must settle it now, but what is it I must
settle? Sometimes I fancy that I am inventing all my trouble,
making it up like a story. Perhaps you shall tell me that, sir,
when I have finished, but I don't think you shall. When I first
came it was all simple. I was lucky and got my work quickly and
made friends. No man ever was helped so fast in a foreign town.
Shouldn't I then be satisfied? Here I had my work that I could
do, and I was not lonely, and then I fell in love and was loved
too. Should I not have been happy, sir? But I was. I have always
been happy. But from the first there were something more. There
was two things. First, I don't hope you shall think me foolish.
There has always been a place I dream of in my sleep. I saw it
first as a little boy when my father had beaten me and I slept
because I was tired. It were always the same place, a house,
empty but for a few things, very clean and shining with sun. Long
stairs with the sun gleaming on them, open doors and mirrors with
green trees reflected, running water. I myself placed some things
there, a statue of Donatello, the Leonardo 'Virgin of the Rocks.'
There was always birds singing, water running, trees and a line
of hills. It is so real to me I could tell you of the marks on
the walls, the hollow in the hill and the thin white road out of
my window. I were very happy there. Secondly, there were the
Cathedral. You know the Brytte Monument and the young man who
made it? I seem to have known him and spoken to him. And when I
were with him I had ideas that I couldn't control--my own work,
the gymnastics and the rest, was unimportant and didn't matter. I
wanted what he too had wanted, to make a beautiful place with
beautiful people. Just one place, or one street even, or one
house. But that were not my business. My business were clear--to
do my work and mind my own affairs.</p>

<p>"Then when I fell in love everything was lost in that. I had
never been in love before. I loved her the moment I saw her, but
for some time I did not know that she loved me, and then when she
said that she did, oh, sir, wasn't I happy? For a time I seemed
to have everything. I sang all day, and every one else was
singing too. My work grew and grew; every one was more kind and
more kind. All was made clear and straight for me. Perhaps I were
too happy. I had suspicions of being too comfortable. I don't
know what it were, but I began to dream again and then to watch
the people around me. I saw that some of them were for using me,
not badly, you know, sir, but for their own purpose, not caring
for me and my work for what was good in it, but only for what
helped what <i>they</i> wanted me to do. Do I make it clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Wistons.</p>

<p>"Then there came two things. I have a friend. His daughter
came home. She had once been unhappy and unfortunate here. You
know, of course, sir, who I mean. People were cruel to her. I had
not thought they would be so narrow or so self-righteous. Perhaps
I am not to blame them, but they are hurting her because they
like to hurt, not because they are shocked by what she did. It
makes them feel better to make her feel worse.</p>

<p>"And then there were Seatown. I went down one afternoon. Oh,
sir, it is terrible, the dirt, the walls tumbling, the windows
broken, the smell, the rags. In such a town as this, so
beautiful, so old, so happy, to have such!</p>

<p>"It's only a little place, one street, fifty houses. One day
would pull it down. I was made unhappy by that. You told me once
I couldn't build before I pulled down. Perhaps that is true. But
what right had I to say anything? It were not my business. I am a
stranger. And deep in my heart I don't wish to change people. I
am not confident enough of my own goodness to teach others. But
if we were all at it together, not because we were better than
others, but because we all saw the same thing to do and set about
to do it!</p>

<p>"Then the lecture came. It were a success, you know. I was
happy for most of it, seeing my friends there pleased in front of
me, but at the last, when I came to make a speech, I were in a
moment ashamed. What was I doing standing there glorifying
myself? This wasn't the work I intended. I wanted to make a
speech speaking of Seatown, and all working together for one
beautiful place that the world might see and so make more
beautiful places. But I was frightened. I knew I should make some
angry, should lose some friends and most of all disappoint my
girl. I was afraid. It was the most shameful moment of my life
and I went from the lecture and hid myself.</p>

<p>"After that everything was clear. Certain in the town made me
see that it were not my business to say anything were wrong with
the town or the people in the town. One important gentleman told
it me quite plainly, and that I must give up the daughter of my
friend if I would go on to be a success here. Then my girl--she
is Miss Maude Penethen, sir, and I lodge with her mother--she is
young, and she wants me to be the greatest success the town has
ever seen. That she must have--success for me, you understand,
not for herself. She wants everybody to like me, you see.</p>

<p>"With every hour from the lecture I see more clearly I must
make a choice. I must be quiet about Seatown, I must not see my
friend's daughter, I must do what certain gentlemen and ladies of
the town tell me, and then I shall be a true success here. I
shall marry and have money and build a big business, later
perhaps in Drymouth and then in London. I know I can because I
have that practical gift. But if I try to change anything, be
myself, and keep my integrity and freedom, I am ruined here, and
so it will be everywhere. Always the same in every place. And
perhaps I shall do nothing in the end. Just be a failure, you
see. But if I work here at my gymnastics I <i>must</i> do good.
And Miss Penethen she won't love me if I'm not as she thinks
moral, if I am friends with people who she thinks are wicked. She
must be happy and see me happy too. I understand her so well. She
is young and beautiful, and she is proud of me. If she's no
longer proud she don't love me. So I must do what every one tells
me or I lose my work, my girl and my friends. And for what do I
lose them? For a dream, an idea. And why should I meddle with
other people? But how can I live and not be honest? How can I
live and not be honest?"</p>

<p>He ended with that despairing cry.</p>

<p>He had poured out his words tempestuously, but Wistons had
understood him.</p>

<p>"This question of honesty," Wistons said at last, "aren't you
making too much of it? It is not, I think, of such overwhelming
importance these days. Your trouble comes down to very little if
you look it in the face. To get on, to make a good job out of the
material world, to put money by, to live on twenty-four hours a
day according to a sharp materialistic pattern, to study success
as an art--all of that is the point in these days when God has
been proved a liar and all religions a sham. Where's your
trouble? Stay here quietly, do what you're told for a year or
two, give up ridiculous dreaming, get power and position and
then, when you're really strong in the place, pull down Seatown
if you like."</p>

<p>"You!" said Johanson. "You to advise that!"</p>

<p>"Well, why not? What do we think of honesty when, to take only
a small example, at this very moment one of the principal
dignitaries of my church is neglecting his ecclesiastical duties
(for which by the way he is quite decently paid) in order to earn
easy money by writing sensational articles in the daily press?
The thing is as old as the world. You wish to give up your home,
your job, your love, because one or two old houses are falling
into ruin, and a lady of your acquaintance has not been
sufficiently called on. Folly!"</p>

<p>Johanson answered.</p>

<p>"Why are you so bitter about life? Has every one always
disappointed you? Have no one been true or honest?"</p>

<p>"I am not bitter," Wistons answered. "I was putting a point of
view to you that many very good people hold, and with much
justice, I daresay. When I was a young man I had a friend who
came up from the provinces to London. He was a painter. For some
while he made very little progress. He was a hard-headed, clever
fellow with no nonsense about him, but he had, rather to his own
surprise, a very warm heart. He thought that this got in the way
of his success, so he did what he could to cool it. Great fame
came to him in a night. That was the critical moment of his life.
He might have been contented with that--it was enough to content
any man. He might have sat down, thought less of himself and his
career, learnt to love his wife, who was charming. But he chose
the other. He wanted more success and more money and more and
more and more. He got rid of his wife, who was, I daresay,
tiresome from the successful point of view. He got fatter and
fatter and ever more deeply concentrated upon himself. He is, I
admit, a very happy man."</p>

<p>"You think he's done wisely?" Johanson asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. He's concentrated upon certainties. He has possessions
that he can finger, a stomach that needs an ever-widening
waistcoat, motor cars and a fine sum at the Bank. He is laughed
at and sneered at, but he comforts himself with the thought that
those who laugh at him are the jealous, unsuccessful ones. He has
touched on certainties. And what are the other things? The
spiritual life? What man or woman alive to-day but has doubts of
its existence? God, Christ, the Saints? Does not book after book
seek to prove them fairy-tales? This death--has it not a tangible
stink of corruption about it that is never out of our nostrils?
Art, friendship, love, are they not for ever fading and failing?
What are we but a little gas and water, formed for an instant,
blown back into &aelig;ther a moment later? Why think of others
who think only of themselves? Why pray vainly to a God who is not
there? Why study the life and words of a Christ whose every
movement is riddled with modern suspicion? Why cheat ourselves
with all this illusion? No, let us clutch our certainties. You
are a fool, Johanson; you are giving up something for
nothing--for nothing at all save certain defeat. What can you do
in this place with your reforms? You are a foreigner. I told you
before and I tell you again that they will not let you take one
single step against their will. And why should they? This is
their town, they have built it on certain moralities, certain
social laws. Those moralities and those laws make them safe. They
have to protect their wives, their children, their earthly
property, their heavenly souls. You come from outside and attack
them. Why should they not defend themselves?"</p>

<p>"I will not attack them," Johanson answered fiercely. "I told
you I would not wish that. I have no right, as you say, and no
desire. But I must be honest. I must not be something that I am
not. I would say to them, 'I think in this way and in this, but
that are only myself.' I must not lie about myself."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Wistons, "but you are against them, and the
things you want may seem to a few others desirable, and so a
little group will grow, and that group will not be contented, as
you are, with simply stating their ideas. They will want to put
them into practice. Then hostilities begin whether you wish it or
no."</p>

<p>"It is more simple than you suppose," Johanson said in a
little while. "I have no doubt that it is right to do. I must not
agree to what I know to be wrong, I am not to interfere with
others, but my own integrity is to be protected at every cost. At
almost every cost. Here is the struggle, you see. I love that
girl, Mr. Wistons, with heart and soul and body. If I for a
moment look over the wall and see myself without her it is
terrible, standing alone in the world. Once that were possible. I
did not mind to be alone, but now that I have been close to her,
to be alone will be a terror. I love her body, but much more I
want her for my companion, some one who knows my troubles and I
knows hers, some one I can always talk with, some one who is true
whatever else may happen, some one who knows me and loves me
although they knows me. Some one half me and I half them. She is
not very wise, perhaps, she is young. She can't think of two
things at once, and she must have some things or she is angry;
and she values some things falsely. We shall quarrel--perhaps
often--but my heart shall be hers and hers mine. I love her so
that if I can't have her I can never be intimate with any one
again."</p>

<p>They sat in silence. After a long time Johanson said, almost
timidly, "What am I to do, Mr. Wistons? What am I to do? I can't
lose her."</p>

<p>"And must you lose her," Wistons asked gently, "if things go
badly with you in the town? Doesn't she care for you more than
that?"</p>

<p>"She is very young," Johanson answered, "and she is jealous.
She loves me, I am sure, but she has been spoilt. She wants her
way. I know that if we were married a year or more I could
control her, but now, if I don't promise not to see my friend's
daughter, I'm afraid her jealousy shall, at some moment, separate
us."</p>

<p>"Then go on for a year with your work," said Wistons, "be
married, keep quiet for a while about Seatown. That will come
right if you wait. There are others besides yourself who are
moving in that."</p>

<p>"And give up my friend?" Johanson asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can be diplomatic about that. Go there a little less,
not see the daughter privately. . . ."</p>

<p>"But they are my friends," Johanson broke in. "Do you think at
once they would not see that I was as the rest of the town?
'Yes,' I say to them, 'I love my girl, and she doesn't like that
I come here. So we meet in secret, you understand?' Oh yes,
<i>they</i> understand! Only a little flush in the face, a little
dropping of the eyes, but Tom Longstaffe's heart is hurt for ever
and I have been false to my word. No, no--No, no, no!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Wistons quietly, "you must persuade the lady you
love, explain to her. If she loves you--"</p>

<p>"If she did not love me," Johanson broke in, "I could,
perhaps. But she are jealous because she love me. Jealousy is so
strong that the one who has it cannot reason. They can only cry
out like they have been wounded. It is not themselves, but a
disease in their stomach like a cancer. And when it is cured they
wonder they have had it. . . ." He sat there, his hands clasped
tightly together. In a voice full of pain he said at last: "Oh,
Mr. Wistons, show me how to keep her, and yet be honest, show me
how."</p>

<p>"There is no way to show you. This is something you must fight
out with your own soul as I have had to fight it out and many
another man. Your real life is at stake now."</p>

<p>"You believe, then, in a real life?" Johanson said urgently.
"My dreams aren't all mist, my desires not all untrue, there is
something--?"</p>

<p>"I believe," said Wistons, "that if God Himself came flaming
before us here in this poor garden and commanded us to put away
our superstitions, to bury our beliefs, to abandon our little
shreds of ideals, to think only of the material life because
there was none other, to know that Christ Jesus was a sham and a
fake, to practise selfishness and gain and worldly success, to
put heaven away from our eyes and to pray no more, I believe that
behind this thunder there would be a still small voice comforting
us and bidding us still believe--</p>

<p>"If the spirit of man is a delusion and a joke, then it is a
joke of so much greater power, glory, hope and comfort than any
serious word that I will go to my grave feeding it, caring for
it, giving it all I have."</p>

<p>"I know how loose words are," Wistons went on quietly after a
little while. "What have I said that means anything or that can't
mean anything you like to make it? But what I know is that there
is more in life than anything that men can do or say, that there
is an immortal spirit whose history, whose struggles, whose
victories and defeats give the whole meaning to this life which
is only one short paragraph in the book of that greater life.
These are our fleshly conditions and we must obey them, but
through them, always, we must be waiting, listening, for ever at
attention to catch the movement of that other life. Your honour,
your courage, your self-sacrifice, your gentleness, kindliness,
if you lose these things you had as well be a sheep's carcass
hanging in any butcher's. That I <i>know</i> to be true." Then he
added, "There's a storm coming. I've felt the thunder over the
hill a long time back. The breeze has gone."</p>

<p>He came over to Johanson and put his hand on his shoulder.
"Come into the house and drink some bad coffee."</p>

<p>Johanson stood up.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I think I'll be off. I'm going to walk back
and I'll not be caught by the storm."</p>

<p>Wistons answered, "Very well. I won't keep you." He added
slowly, "I've not been much help to you. It's my fate never to
help the people I want to, but I doubt in this whether any one
could help you much. It's your own fight."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's my own fight." Johanson shook himself like a dog
coming out of water. "But you have helped me. Immense. I don't
know which way it will be, but whatever way it is I shall never
forget what you have said."</p>

<p>Wistons nodded his head.</p>

<p>"All right, then. Come up again some time. I shall always like
to see you. I wish you luck."</p>

<p>They shook hands and Johanson strode away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The sky blackened, the stars vanished, and a little
underground breeze rustled along the ground like a creature
whispering news; a distant mutter grumbled behind the hill.</p>

<p>The way back to Polchester was straight enough, but as he left
the little village and pressed to the top of a bare and desolate
hill he felt as though he were entering strange and hostile
country. As is so often the case with the inland Glebeshire
country, thick and wooded valleys give place with swift
precipitancy to plains as bare as a knuckle-bone. On these plains
there is little life, never a tree to be seen, only a bare
cottage or two clinging, with feet stubbornly implanted, to the
hostile and ungracious soil. It was on such a desolate plain that
Johanson now found himself.</p>

<p>But he was not conscious of the scene nor of the coming storm.
As he left Pybus behind him, so, too, Wistons faded. It was true
that Wistons had helped him, but rather by listening than by his
own words. Those words had been, it seemed to Johanson, a little
melodramatic, a little sentimental. They might mean anything or
nothing. This spirit of man, what was it? This after-life--was it
of any use to consider that when one had so much ado to carry
through the present one? Johanson had never, in that sense, been
a religious man. All his impulses, both spiritual and temporal,
drove him towards the creation of something in this world. That
seemed to him to be his whole business. He prayed sometimes to
God; he thought, as every man must do, of the consequences of
physical death, but he did not <i>live</i> for any after-life.
His business seemed to be all with this one.</p>

<p>Clergymen, he had often thought, took it too readily for
granted that men's constant preoccupation must be with the life
of the spirit. They slipped into phrases that were too easy to be
interesting. He knew that Wistons was different from other men in
that his constant preoccupation was with the spiritual life, and
that his angry, starved, lonely, discomforted soul had no other
hope but the hope beyond the grave. Wistons was no humbug and no
loose thinker either, but for that very reason he could not
understand Johanson's aching love for Maude. There was all his
trouble, all his problem this night. He was going to lose her, he
was going to lose her!</p>

<p>He saw her with marvellous clarity as he strode across the
plain. True and deep love is not blind: it sees defects and
weakness with an intensity that is part of its agony. He knew
that she was spoilt and shallow, ignorant and vain, that she
would not be able to endure the tests of unpopularity and poverty
and hostility, that her code of morality was harsh, limited,
stupid, that her view of the world was provincial and ignorant,
but he saw also beneath all this most truly that she was a child
capable of infinite tenderness and goodness, were she only loved
long enough and wisely enough. Give him one year and he would
change her so that her own mother would not know her! He would
make himself so necessary to her that when at the last the test
came, she would endure anything rather than leave him.</p>

<p>But now--seeing her only for a short period of the day, not
sharing with her those loving hours of the night that bind human
souls together as no other power can do--the least trouble, a
flash of jealousy, a refusal on his part to go her way in some
social matter, and she would be off riding ferociously on the
wind of her outraged vanity.</p>

<p>He knew that it was not only Mary Longstaffe that would be the
trouble. Unless he bowed his head to the Ronders and the Bonds,
unless he smiled on Hogg and his wretched Seatown, unless he
permitted himself humbly to be patronised by the Cassidys and
Carlyons of the town, unless he surrendered for many a year his
dream of beautiful buildings and a place worthy of that
Cathedral, unless all this were so, his whole position would
change, his business would droop, it might be that real hostility
would break upon him. He had at least one enemy in Hogg, who was
only waiting for his moment.</p>

<p>And then he would lose Maude. You might fancy that she was
worth but little if she were so easily lost. But she was as yet
but half created. Every lover has the thought that he is creating
the one he loves, not in his own image, but in something far more
beautiful and divine. He would not have loved Maude so dearly had
she not needed his tender care. Love is only half love if it is
not half maternal.</p>

<p>He felt the first warm drops of rain upon his face. The little
breeze had gone and the air was so close that he seemed to be
packed within an iron cage. The thunder cracked across the plain,
a God snapping his giant fingers. The cold, pale face of the
lightning swerved like a turning mirror across the earth, and he
saw a white world, bare, chill and dead. Then the thunder burst,
cracking again and again inside his brain, as it seemed. The rain
descended like whips and the ground hissed like snakes.</p>

<p>In that instant it seemed that he saw Maude, lovely, untouched
by the storm, her hair uncovered, her arms out to him. He caught
her to him, stumbling to the ground, and murmured as he caressed
her cheek:</p>

<p>"Darling, darling . . . it's all over. Stay with me. I give up
everything for you. What is anything else worth if I haven't you?
Come closer. Come closer. Love me terribly. Yes, yes. I will do
that and that and that. I will do anything, everything. Only stay
with me, love me. I will shelter you. Come here under my coat. No
one shall touch, no one shall hurt you. Yes, yes, I will do all
you tell me. No, I have given up my dreams. They worried you, so
I threw them away. . . . Love me, love me, love me. Put your hand
there on my heart. Here, I will lay my head between your
breasts--so. Now close my eyes as you kiss them. Slowly, slowly.
Don't sigh, darling. No trouble shall ever come to you again.
Only let me lie here. Draw down my head and kiss my eyes again.
Come closer, closer so that the rain does not touch you. Now let
your heart beat with the beating of mine. So. Both of us
together. Now we are one body and one flesh. No one can separate
us. Have no fear. Have no fear. . . ."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The lightning flared across his eyes. He was on his knees
alone and the plain was like the plain of the moon in its
desolation. Maude was not. He had betrayed himself for her, and
the reward was not enough. He knew, absolutely, that it was not
enough. Maude had come to him, had crept into his very spirit,
but the betrayal of himself that had invited her had changed her
into dust.</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet. The rain was coming down in a joyful
flood, dancing in the plenitude of its power. He was soaked with
it so that he became part of it. The thunder was remote; the
lightning palely trembled on a far horizon. He stretched his
arms, raised his head to heaven.</p>

<p>He knew that his crisis was finished and for ever. Not for God
himself could he betray the Godhead in himself, far less for
man.</p>

<p>It was as though a thief had come in the night and tried to
steal, as he slept, the only treasure that he had, and he had
woken in time.</p>

<p>He had realised Maude utterly, possessed her completely, and
it had not been enough. Nor would anything else be enough to
compensate for the loss of his immortal part.</p>

<p>He gazed about him bewildered, like a man who had been
sleeping. He pressed the back of his hand, washed with the rain,
against his eyes. The crisis had been so swift. He did not know
how long he had been on his knees. It was truly as though Maude
had been there. He had possessed her, had triumphed with joy, and
then had known that desolation of betrayal and dismay at his
unexpected loss. All this, it might be, in a second of time. He
did not know. It had been like a revelation, and his whole life
was settled by it.</p>

<p>As the rain washed his face he felt the strength rise within
him like a flood. It was so wonderful to see his purpose so
clearly. Yes, he would love Maude no less, he would keep all the
love in the world that he was permitted to keep, but he had been
given his scale of values, values mortal and immortal.</p>

<p>He walked on triumphantly, through the rain.</p>

<h1><a name="c205">CHAPTER V</a></h1>

<h1>SUMMER NIGHT</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I have remarked elsewhere in other chronicles of our town on
the strange progress of rumour. Polchester was less confined and
provincial in 1906 than it had been in 1897, but it was closer to
that earlier town than to the modern city that Carstairs Bellows
and the rest afterwards made of it.</p>

<p>The town life was still very largely a family affair.
Servants, related through centuries of Glebeshire ancestry, still
carried gossip from door to door, and from the filthiest Seatown
slum to the quiet splendour of the Bishop's library at Carpledon
the chain ran link by link from house to house.</p>

<p>The gossip was seldom of evil intent. People will see a puppy,
kettle tied to tail, chased by small boys, and will shrink with
horror at the sight; returning then to their tea, they will
happily chatter away the life and happiness of two human beings
who have never harmed them. Sight is everything: for most of us
what we do not see we do not feel.</p>

<p>Our Town had seen Harmer John and, foreigner though he was,
had loved him. It had taken him to its heart and, of course,
expected him to be sufficiently grateful for that honour. He had
begun to show his gratitude quite properly by giving the place a
new hobby, by declaring his devotion to its beauty, by engaging
himself to a native and by providing a novel and charming
entertainment. All this was well: for a mere foreigner very well
indeed. He must now carry on that good beginning by devoting
himself to the town's interest, transforming himself into a true
citizen--difficult work for a foreigner, of course, and only to
be achieved by his complete surrender to the town's wishes.</p>

<p>A week or two after the lecture it began to be whispered that
this same surrender was neither so swift nor so desirable as it
should be. Some one said that some one else had said that some
one had heard Harmer John say. . . . Some one said that Harmer
John was having trouble with his girl, and some one added to that
that his girl thought that he was spending too much of his time
with another lady.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, you touched upon one of the tenderest spots in
Polchester morality. Once publicly engaged, you were engaged. To
walk out casually with a lady to see whether you liked her, that
was a wise precaution against too precipitate matrimony, but,
engaged before the world, proclaimed at a dinner, danced upon and
sung over, after that, there you were and there you must
stay.</p>

<p>Of course, one knew what foreigners were: dangerous in sexual
matters as no Englishman could ever be. Did one not know what
Paris stood for, and although Harmer John came from the North
somewhere, as far from Polchester as Paris was, nevertheless,
once out of England the danger was the same. And if Harmer John
once played fast and loose with a Polchester girl . . . !</p>

<p>Then, Rumour continued, there was this Seatown affair. What
had happened in Seatown? No one precisely knew. He had gone down
there and laid his hand on a sick child's forehead and the child
had instantly recovered. Since then certain women in the town
were always bringing him children with colds and coughs and
headaches, and he cured them just by looking at them.</p>

<p>Witchcraft? Well, this was a modern world and we know that
witchcraft is nonsense--nevertheless these foreigners learn funny
tricks in these foreign places. Every one knew that you cured
colds with quinine, not by looking the patient in the eyes. That
was hypnotism or mesmerism, the kind of thing practised once at
the annual Fair in our town by a foreign gentleman in a shiny
tall hat and a soiled white shirt, chased ultimately away by the
policeman. In any case what had Harmer John to do with Seatown?
Why was he down there so often? Some of the roughest men in the
place had been heard to suggest that if he came meddling with
their women they'd have something to say. . . .</p>

<p>There was also the case of Mary Longstaffe. Rumour had
something to murmur about that. It had, of course, been hard on
the girl that her lover should have died before he could marry
her, and had she only stayed away from our town nobody would have
interfered. She would have been pleasantly and easily forgotten.
Had she wished even to pay a short visit to her father, so
forgiving is our town and so conscious of human weakness that it
might, for a brief period, have turned aside and looked the other
way. But to come back and live, bringing with her the child of
her sin! There was obstinacy, pride and rebellion! Why, it was as
though Polchester were nothing at all, a mere paltry village to
be insulted quite casually by anybody! No, no, thank God, our
town had its pride. It had also its moral code. The sons of our
Archdeacons might run away with the daughters of our citizens,
but at least they had the grace to run away and stay away. Mary
Longstaffe's presence in our town was a perpetual menace to our
good name and proper pride. Once an evil liver always an evil
liver. Didn't every one know that? The pleasures of the flesh
once tasted were too pleasant not to taste again!</p>

<p>And here she was at her old tricks, detaching a man from his
girl--and alas, it seemed, if all that Rumour said was true, that
he was only too ready to be detached.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at this present time our town had no intention
of being unkind to Harmer John: it had its eye upon him merely,
and entirely, of course, for his good.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was not very long before many people noticed a change in
the man. It was not that he was less pleasant or friendly, but
rather that he was sterner and something more preoccupied in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>But the true change in him was made manifest to Ronder earlier
than to any one else in the town. The massage was finished and
Johanson was about to leave the bedroom when Ronder, with that
charming friendly smile of his warranted to put dragons at their
ease, said, "And now, my dear fellow, what about the next
lecture?"</p>

<p>Johanson, putting his things away in a small bag, said, "Oh, I
don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know?" Ronder shook his head with the greatest
friendliness. "Come, that won't do. We are all expecting it,
people are demanding it. Besides," he drew near to Johanson and
put his hand on his shoulder, "it is necessary for the town. You
are now a factor in the town's progress, remember. You are no
longer a private citizen."</p>

<p>"Am I not?" Johanson straightened himself. "I shall have my
liberty though, Canon Ronder."</p>

<p>It was then that Ronder felt the change in the man. It had
been his happiness that, all his life, he could deal with human
souls as though he played a game of chess. He was aloof from
them, vastly indulgent to them, feeling no surprise at their
weaknesses and folly, liking them, often helping them and never
pitying them. But this playing of them one against the other had
become such a passion with him that he now often played his game
simply for the love of playing it and without any definite
purpose.</p>

<p>So, of late, he had been aware that at times he seemed to beat
the air; people eluded him as once they had not done; his touch
was no longer so sure. Many persons in the town, from Ambrose
Wistons down to Samuel Hogg, seemed now to bear with them a faint
air of hostility. He had been sometimes suspicious of late that
people laughed at him. Did he lose his power over others he lost
everything in life save his private self-indulgences, and he was
still alive enough to see whither they might lead him, had they
rein.</p>

<p>But here in Johanson was a man whom he felt that he completely
controlled. What made it pleasanter was that he liked the fellow.
He liked his physical size and strength and health and good
humour and na&iuml;vet&eacute; and honesty. He appreciated good
qualities in others immensely; they added to his sense of his own
well-being.</p>

<p>This man, a foreigner, knowing little of the world and with an
infinite and touching belief in the honesty of others, was ideal
for his purpose. He had never hitherto doubted but that he could
mould him exactly to his shape and pattern.</p>

<p>Now, in one flash of perception, he doubted. There was
something in Johanson's eye, voice, the squaring of his
shoulders, that caused Ronder to wonder whether after all he had
known the man at all. And the thought that was to be common in
the next weeks to many of his fellow-citizens came to him. After
all, with these foreigners, you never can tell!</p>

<p>"Your liberty, my dear fellow! Why, who is threatening
that?"</p>

<p>Johanson smiled, "Nobody."</p>

<p>"That's all right, then," said Ronder. "We must see about a
date. If I am to take the chair for you again, as I should very
much like to do, it won't be so easy to find a free date within
the next month or two. It's extraordinary how things pile up! We
should have it before the weather gets too warm and before the
children's holidays start. Let me see!" He stood in his handsome
dressing-gown and furred bedroom slippers delicately
considering.</p>

<p>"I'm in no hurry, sir," said Johanson, taking his bag and
turning towards the door. "My mind's not clear yet about what I
shall say. It shall be necessary to go a little farther than the
last time."</p>

<p>Again that new note in the man's voice!</p>

<p>Ronder did not intend to stand any nonsense; it would be as
well to put down that furred bedroom slipper here and now!</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said. "What do you mean by that? If I'm to
take the chair for you I must know what you intend to say. You're
not going to plunge into controversial matters, I hope."</p>

<p>Johanson turned from the door smiling with all his accustomed
warm friendliness.</p>

<p>"Canon Ronder, you've been very kind to me for a long way
back. I would like to do always as you would wish me, but I must
be myself. I can't be another. I see life as I see it, and I see
this town as I see it. I can't see it another way."</p>

<p>"Now, my dear friend," Ronder came up to Johanson, placed his
hands on his shoulders, and the two faces were so close to one
another that Johanson could see the little curling hairs in
Ronder's ears and the tiny red veins (and later they would be
purple) that ran down on either side of his nostrils, "we are
friends, are we not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Johanson, moving his big shoulders ever so
slightly.</p>

<p>"And have been friends ever since we first met, I think. We
both love this town, and we have both of us certain gifts that we
can place at her service. Now there are things that you know that
I do not, and there are things that I know, knowledge of the
world a little, perhaps, that you have not yet learned. You have
not, I am afraid, taken our little talk of the other day to heart
as I should have wished. I am not asking you--as indeed how could
I?--to cease your friendship with any one here, only to be a
little more discreet, a trifle less public--"</p>

<p>"You speak of Miss Longstaffe?" Johanson moved away from
Ronder's touch.</p>

<p>"Oh, why mention names? My good fellow, you won't take this
amiss, I know. It is only because you are a stranger here--"</p>

<p>"But I like it better to mention names," Johanson interrupted.
He paused a moment, then continued: "Canon Ronder, you are a
clever man. You understand the world. Do you not realise that if
some one have a friend whom they know to be good it is when all
the world try to part them that they stick the closest? Tom
Longstaffe was and is and ever shall be my friend. His daughter I
hardly know. I like her, yes, but all women is rather shadowy to
me just now because I love one woman so much. But Miss Longstaffe
is a good woman, I think, and courageous and honest, and she have
a dear little boy. Do you think I would give up my friends
because they are abused by people? Why, no! You would not
yourself!"</p>

<p>"But no one is asking you to give them up," Ronder answered
impatiently. (Lord! how tiresomely simple the fellow was!)
"Surely you can be as friendly as you like with them without
being for ever seen with them in public? That's all I ask. A
little discretion. Your friends here want people to look up to
you, to admire you. If you are to do good work in the town you
must show every one that you put some value on morality and
decent living. You are entering on a public career. It is not as
though you were a nobody. Many eyes are upon you."</p>

<p>"It is not true," Johanson answered slowly, "that I am seen
often with Miss Longstaffe in public, but speaking to me this
way, Canon Ronder, will assist me to be so. I am not a boy. I
have my pride like another man. Were you the best friend I have
in the world, Canon Ronder, you should not dictate to me my
loyalties. Good afternoon." And before Ronder could shape his
next indignant sentence Johanson was away.</p>

<p>But he could not be preoccupied with Ronder, nor with any
gossip that there might be in the town. His one thought was for
Maude. In some way he must persuade her sufficiently of his love
of her and of her absolute need for him, so that, whatever
troubles might come, she would not be able to leave him. Give him
only time! Give him only time! Could he only make her understand
that he not only did not love Mary Longstaffe, but that she was
hardly more than an acquaintance, and if then after that he might
show her that she, Maude, was the first, last and only love of
his life! But with it all he was not very clever. He had had but
little experience with women, his honesty (a quality not
universally practised by lovers) was for ever in his way, and he
did not know that Maude, like most women, lived on little
assurances and demonstrations.</p>

<p>He could, perhaps, during those important weeks, have chained
her to him for ever, had he been a little less single-minded, a
little more subtle. But he was not subtle; he was not clever at
perceiving the things that people wanted him to be<i>,</i> do or
say.</p>

<p>And yet he was wise enough to understand the real spirit that
Maude had; he understood it better than any one, including her
mother.</p>

<p>He understood it better than any one ever would again. The
divine spark in Maude at this moment was a small quivering flame,
but it was alight. He could have fanned it into a fire that would
have made her a noble woman.</p>

<p>Poor Maude! She also had had no experience of love. She did
not know what this strange confusion of feeling--of jealousy,
selfishness, unselfishness, physical desire, maternal tenderness,
passionate surrender, autocratic domination, weariness and
excitement might be. For the first time in her trivial vain
little life she encountered love, and it was not love exactly as
she had thought it would be; it was love with difficulty, love
that needed great qualities of unselfishness and charity and
patience. Those qualities had not as yet grown in her to
sufficient stature.</p>

<p>She was in a thousand moods a day. Before he came home from
his work she sat up in her room listening for the sound of his
step. Her heart beat thickly, her cheeks were hot, her throat
dry. She loved him so terribly that all she wanted was to stay
quietly beside him and feel him to be there. When he came she
would be so good. She would not say one word that would irritate
him. She would not mention the name of that horrid woman. . . .
She would not tell him the gossip that she had heard in the town,
that he had quarrelled with Canon Ronder or that the men in
Seatown were going to duck him in the Pol.</p>

<p>These things had disturbed her terribly; she watched his
popularity rise and fall with the breathless anxiety of a farmer
watching his weather-glass. But she would not say a word. She
would only tell him that she loved him and loved him and loved
him. And then when she had been with him two minutes out it all
came--all of it. How some one had said that he had spent all the
day in Mary Longstaffe's room; how some one else had said that he
and Mary Longstaffe were planning to run away together; how again
she had heard that if he were not careful and kept his tongue
quiet he would lose all his clients; how this, how that--out it
all came in an angry tempestuous flood, ending always with, "And
you don't love me. I know you don't. Otherwise you wouldn't
behave so."</p>

<p>When first she had said that, it had delighted her to see the
look of astonished pain and surprise in his eyes as though he
were truly amazed that any one for a moment of time could doubt
his love. But she had now said the same thing so often that it
was impatience rather than pain that his eyes showed.</p>

<p>"Tell me how much you love me," she demanded. "More than you
ever thought you could love anybody? More than every one in the
world together? More than--"</p>

<p>At first he answered her with passionate assertions, but now
the demand was so frequent that he refused to answer.</p>

<p>"If you can't see," he said, "I shan't tell you. It is an
insult to ask me so often. You must know without for ever
asking." And one day when his arms were around her and his cheek
against hers she was entirely reassured and felt that she could
snap her beautiful fingers at all the Mary Longstaffes in
creation, but by the following day she was all uneasy again and
the reassurance was demanded once more.</p>

<p>His love for her was so clear to himself and so patent, it
seemed to him, to all the world that he did not know how to make
it clearer. He sought Mrs. Penethen in his trouble. That wise
woman had made hitherto no comment. She never offered advice, she
never asked questions. Only when something must be done she said
so; so far as the household affairs were concerned it was always
Judy who did it.</p>

<p>It may be expected, however, that she had her private
anxieties. Her attitude to Johanson was still very much what it
had been on the night of his first appearance. She had felt a
mother to him then: she would feel a mother to him to the last.
But she had passed, in other years, through such deeps of
emotion, sorrow and self-control that she would be always an
observer rather than a participator. She knew his trouble,
though, before he came to her.</p>

<p>They took a little walk together to the Cathedral and then
round to the green paths under the grey walls. Between the trees,
heavy now with the bright green leaves of the new summer, the
waters of the Pol flashed and sparkled in broken segments and
squares and circles. Once and again the Cathedral chimes came
softly down to them like the very voice of the summer trees.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen always dressed in the same fashion when she went
out--a black or a purple bonnet, a dark cloak that fell in
straight folds like a knight's mantle, a white collar and white
cuffs to her black dress. She seemed like the foundress of some
mysterious order.</p>

<p>"You may have to take her away," she said, looking at him with
her soft gentle eyes so unlike the sternness of her figure.</p>

<p>"Take her away?" he repeated, startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, it may be the only thing. Here she must be the wife of
Somebody, that is her great determination. If things go badly
with you here it will hurt her dreadfully. In another place she
won't mind so much because she won't hear so much."</p>

<p>"You think things are going to go badly with me here, then?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She stood still looking at a splash of river intensely blue
between the curve of the leaves.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But you're too strong to be beaten into the
shape they want, and it will take you years to beat <i>them</i>
into anything. Do you know that you can't change people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you can," he answered eagerly, thinking of Maude, "if you
care enough."</p>

<p>She shook her bonnet.</p>

<p>"No, you cannot. I never changed my husband. He learnt to keep
some things out of my way and I learnt not to bother him with
questions. That's the most married people ever learn." She went
on after a moment: "I was in service when I was a young girl. My
mistress was determined to cure her husband of taking snuff. She
died, poor thing, in the effort."</p>

<p>"But Maude is so young. If I have her only long enough with me
I can make her see and feel in her very soul that I love her." He
stopped for a moment, took off his hat and felt the sun on his
head. "It's that--that she can think I don't love her--it's that
that beats me. What should I do, Mrs. Penethen? Tell me what I
should do?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you should have done," she answered with
energy, "only, of course, it's too late now. It's Judy you should
have married."</p>

<p>"Judy!" he cried. "Judy! Why, she hates me!"</p>

<p>"No, she does not," Mrs. Penethen answered. "She loves you and
has always done. And, much more than that, she understands you.
She knows what you want. She saw that that lecture was
tomfoolery. She'd like to see you fight the Town and beat it.
She'd back you in anything. She's the only one in all this place
who knows you. And she always has."</p>

<p>He felt a sort of provoked irritation. He did not want to
think of Judy, that dark frowning girl who never laughed and
watched him ironically. Besides, he did not believe a word of
it.</p>

<p>"Misfortunately," he answered drily, "it's Maude who I love,
and love her so that no other woman can be even thought of. Can't
you persuade her of that, Mrs. Penethen? Can't you make her see
that she have so much reason to be jealous of the moon as any
other woman?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy isn't reasonable," answered Mrs. Penethen; "any one
will tell you that. I was jealous once of my husband and a girl
in a grocer's. She was ugly and stupid, but I hated her. I'd have
poisoned her sugar and flour for her if I could. I never knew
whether I had reason or not. Jealousy's a thing to make you
ashamed of yourself if anything ever was, but it's a thing you're
to be pitied for too. Maude's jealous. Can't you see that woman
less than you do?"</p>

<p>"I don't see her very often," he said, "but her father's my
best friend. The people here all cut her. Wouldn't you stand up
for your friend?"</p>

<p>"But if you have to choose between her and Maude?"</p>

<p>"Choose!" he burst out. "But that's ridiculous. I don't hope
that you too think that I am in love with her!"</p>

<p>"No, I do not. But just now, things being as they are, I think
you're a little too honest about it. Why tell Maude when you've
been there? There's no need. I heard you two or three days ago
saying you'd just come from there."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't I say when there's nothing in it?"</p>

<p>"Bless the man!" She shook her head ironically. "Don't you
know anything about women? They'll put up with anything if it
isn't set right in front of their faces. All they want is the
permission to cheat themselves. They don't bless a man for too
much honesty, I can tell you."</p>

<p>He stared about him in a kind of dismay. "I don't understand
it," he said. "It should all be so straight with me and Maude. I
love her, heart, soul and body. So I have always done. I will
give up anything to her, everything I have--"</p>

<p>"Except what you think to be right," said Mrs. Penethen.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "I'm not worth Maude's having if I lose
that."</p>

<p>"I don't think women care much," Mrs. Penethen said. "What
they want is to have a man, all of him, head to toe. Most women,
I believe, would rather have a man of poor character and have all
of him than a man of good character and only a bit of him. I
don't know. It's hard to say. But what I'm afraid of with Maude
is that she'll get into one of her tantrums and fly off and find
herself engaged to somebody else before her head's clear, and
then still be too proud to come back to you again."</p>

<p>He stopped and stood there in the sunlight bareheaded. She saw
that he was dreadfully troubled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Penethen," he said, "I mustn't lose her. I mustn't.
Life without her would be such pain. Oh, help me not to lose her!
You're her mother. Tell her. Advise her."</p>

<p>All her heart went out to him. She put her hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"For just now," she said, "I'll advise you. Don't at this time
see the other lady too much and don't tell Maude when you have
seen her. And don't get into trouble with the people here before
you've married Maude. You've only got to wait until October. When
you're married, if you have trouble she'll have to share it
whether she likes it or not. And that will be good for her
too."</p>

<p>She looked up whimsically into his face out of her soft grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"All the same," she said, shaking her bonnet at him, "it's
Judy you ought to have married."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A summer night came. The old phantasmal fires belonging to the
soil here before bricks and mortar were thought of had their
brief hour of resurrection in a flaming sky. Loge, at some unseen
Wotan's bidding, hemmed in the Cathedral with a wall of fire, and
the woods caught the blaze and the Pol was stained with scarlet.
It sank, and a pale wash of silver white flooded the scene.</p>

<p>As dusk passed into early night and the stars stamped the sky,
summer became vocal. It was the first real summer night of the
year, and a faint film of silver light hung like gauze about the
quiet streets. Scents of flowers and trees and hedgerows
penetrated everywhere. Mrs. Dunning, the widow who kept the "Blue
Boar," that stuffy little hostelry at the south end of the
market, smelt them and opened the sitting-room window and leaned
out and looked at the stairs. Samuel Hogg, watching with smiling
face Fletch play Cassidy the grocer at billiards, smelt them and
went into the doorway of the Y.M.C.A. building and sniffed
contemptuously the air. Mrs. Combermere, finishing a pleasant and
solitary little dinner in her house in the Precincts, a book
about dog breeding propped up against the water-jug in front of
her, smelt them and told her little servant-maid that she should
be out with her young man that evening--a night for lovers. Miss
Ronder, finishing <i>her</i> meal opposite her nephew the Canon,
smelt them and, looking cynically across the table at his eager
intent to get the very best out of his Angel on Horseback,
thought of carnations, her favourite flower, masses of them, dark
crimson and wine-purple. Wistons, sitting alone in his tangled
little garden at Pybus, was bathed in the flowers, in the soil of
the hill, in the water of the running stream. He was thinking of
Christ, watching for Him, as he often did, to come in through the
garden gate and quietly, peacefully to sit down at his side. So
they would sit, the two of them, in the little garden, friends
who needed no words.</p>

<p>Johanson smelt them. He stood in his bedroom, his head through
the open window, looking up at the fiery stars. Fiery they were
to-night, some of them so restless as though they were
intolerably excited, and the steady ones shining with an extra
gleam. Maude had gone to supper with those tiresome dull people
the Boultewoods. He couldn't abide them, mother, son and
daughter. He felt strangely as though they menaced him in some
way. They! Those flat-faced cows! He was in an ill temper
to-night, knowing that Maude had gone out to supper with them
only to irritate him. She had asked him to take her to the house
(it was at the south end of the town), and then when he had
eagerly agreed she had laughingly told him that young Boultewood
was coming to fetch her, and that he could accompany the two of
them if he liked. She was always teasing him in this way now, and
behind the light superficiality of it there was something serious
and restless and angry.</p>

<p>Oh, why could she not be quiet and trust him and see that he
loved her? Why must she be for ever probing him and defying him
and relenting, scolding him and forgiving, vehemently accusing
him and then passionately repenting?</p>

<p>As he looked out and swam up to the quivering silver of the
stars he longed for tranquillity. Everything was rocking to a
crisis. On such a night he could not stay within doors. He took
his hat and walked out.</p>

<p>He thought he would go round towards the south of the town and
perhaps he might meet her walking back. She would not be eager to
stay very late; the family bored her quite as sharply as they
bored him; she had gone there only to provoke him and would soon
have enough of it.</p>

<p>On the south side of Polchester overhanging Seatown there is a
little public garden. In 1907 it was a very small and overgrown
little piece with a tiny battered rococo temple, and some stairs
and rain-washed garden seats. Now, as every one knows, the
efforts of Cassidy and others have changed it into a fine public
park, and once again, after more than a hundred years, the
streets beneath it have become fashionable. From it you can no
longer look over and down to the small cluster of Seatown lights,
for Seatown is no more.</p>

<p>But to-night Johanson looked down. The one Seatown street
showed its straight line of scattered lights, and behind that
line the others lay coiled like the eyes of watching animals
nested lazily in the warm night. The place had a stranger
fascination for him than anything else, save the Cathedral, in
Polchester. He knew that in some fashion it was here that his
destiny would reach its crisis. In some fashion, too, that little
bunch of dirty houses would be his test, and he fancied that as
he looked down those eyes looked up, lazily, contemptuously, but
with some shadow of apprehension.</p>

<p>He turned away; it was not with Seatown that he was occupied
to-night, but with Maude--always and for ever with Maude.</p>

<p>He turned, saw first the little temple black against the
milk-white sky with stars hanging to its roof like birds, and
then, close at his side and quite unconscious of him, Mary
Longstaffe.</p>

<p>His first sense when he realised that she had not seen him was
to slip away. Here was danger, the course against which even Mrs.
Penethen had warned him. Then, ashamed of his even momentary
hesitation, he went up to her.</p>

<p>"Miss Longstaffe! All alone?" he said.</p>

<p>He saw her face in the starlit haze. She had been thinking sad
thoughts. Her broad strong figure, the fine brave carriage of her
head belied the almost childish distress in her eyes. She covered
her melancholy with a smile as she turned to him, giving him her
hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "It was so lovely a night that I couldn't
stay indoors. Father has gone to some meeting and isn't to be
back till eleven. Then we shall share our family cocoa."</p>

<p>They walked up and down the little garden path together, and
at once, as it always was with them, they reached a basis of
frank comradeship that Johanson knew with no other woman in the
world.</p>

<p>"I have been a little sad to-night," she said. "Anything very
beautiful has something sad in it, of course, because it is
unattainable, I suppose--beauty. It slips away from you so
quickly. And then on a night like this the time when I was happy
here comes back so sharply. Of course I have my lover still. He
never leaves me.</p>

<p>"But sometimes, however sure one is of that, one aches for
something tangible, the pressure of his hand again, the touch of
his sleeve."</p>

<p>"How do you mean," he asked, "that he never leaves you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a sentimental woman," she answered. "I've lived in
London now for years, working like a man. I'm no spiritualist. I
couldn't even swear to you that I am sure of a future life. But I
mean that literally Lance never leaves me. I think that perhaps
when I die we shall be separated, but until then he is as much
with me as he was before he had that accident. More, because then
it was often difficult for us to be together. Why," she said,
turning to him, "do you think I could ever stand it with all
these cats here behaving to me as they do if he wasn't at my side
all the time?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? That you can see him--definitely?"</p>

<p>"Of course. More definitely than when he was alive. We do
everything together. Oh, but what is it?" She turned to him
almost passionately. "Do I cheat myself? Of course I don't see
him, nor hear his voice, but most of the time he does seem to be
there. Only there are the intervals. There was one this evening.
I dread them so much. At those times I feel that it is all a
sham. There is no Lance. Billy is all that remains of him."</p>

<p>They walked a little while and then she said, "I'm so glad I
saw you to-night. You were just the person. But we mustn't meet
very much just now, and you must come to our house less often.
I've been talking to father about it."</p>

<p>"I must? Why?" Johanson asked.</p>

<p>"Because it's doing you harm. We are marked people at present.
You've got your business to build up, and it would be really
serious for you if your reputation were damaged by knowing us. I
shan't be here for so very long, I suppose. I can stand it, but
when father loses his congregation through me it is time I went
away again. It's hard. I have only father and Billy and Lance. I
don't want to interfere with any one. Only to be left alone with
my three. But they won't permit it. And next time I go father
will go too, leave the work of his life. I ought never to have
come--and yet, I don't know, father and I have had some wonderful
days. So," she said, staring down at the Seatown lights, "you
won't come to our house very much just now--will you,
please?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "A fine friend I'd be, Miss Longstaffe, loving
your father and your son, and being a friend of your own, and
giving you all up for the town's gossip. Would you think that of
me now?"</p>

<p>"But it's serious," she went on. "There's another reason.
Don't think I don't hear everything. I do. There's the lady
you're engaged to. She doesn't like your knowing me. Forgive me
if I'm poking my nose in where it oughtn't to be, but you mustn't
make <i>her</i> unhappy--"</p>

<p>He was silent a moment before he answered. "No, I mustn't. But
I've had all this out with myself. I can't give my friends up for
nobody. I can arrange that those who don't like one another don't
meet, or be tactful, you know, about speaking of them, but where
my heart is there I must be loyal. Maude shall have that. She
must, if we are to be happy."</p>

<p>His face seemed to her sterner and older than she had ever
seen it, as he now looked at her. "You know, Miss Longstaffe,
that shoe shall very soon be on the other leg. It will be whether
you and Tom care know me, not me you. I shall in a little time be
the most unpopular man in Polchester. . . ." He shrugged his
shoulders. "It shall be new to me, that experience. Men have
always liked me, and I like to be liked. But soon they'll drive
me out of this town if they can--"</p>

<p>"Why? What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Do? Nothing! That's just it. I won't be under their orders.
If they ask me whether their town is beautiful I shall say, 'Yes,
it is beautiful, but your slum is filthy.' If they ask me, 'Are
we not fine people?' I shall say, 'Yes, but you can be finer and
me too.' If they say I must lick Ronder's shoes, I shall not. I
am a foreigner. Very quickly, in a night, a foreigner is a
suspicious person. First I was good because I were pleased with
everything and had no opinions. So it might have gone for a long
while. But I saw Seatown and the way they treated you. And they
wanted me to be a sort of clown and turn somersaults for them.
But I shall make one beautiful thing, somewhere, some place in
the town, and then they'll kick me out. I know it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see that," she said. "You must be yourself. We are
alike in that. Well, here's luck."</p>

<p>She held out her hand and he took it.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that you're not to get into trouble because of
us. That would make us very unhappy."</p>

<p>They walked out of the little garden and turned up the street
towards the market-place.</p>

<p>At the corner he paused. "Forgive me," he said, "I shall wait
here. Maude--Miss Penethen, you know--I'm engaged to, she's been
taking supper with some friends here, and she would be returning
just about now."</p>

<p>As he spoke two figures emerged from a side street. He saw,
instantly, with a sense that this was fate, and prearranged by an
interfering Heaven, that these were Maude and young Boultewood.
There was nothing to be done. Young Boultewood was laughing in
that idiotic way of his like a braying ass. Maude was quiet,
walking swiftly. "Perhaps she is hurrying back to me." He had an
instinct to push Mary Longstaffe into a doorway. Anything to
prevent the meeting. But he did not move. His companion, who did
not, of course, know Maude by sight, went on: "Well, then, I'll
wish you good night. I'm so glad that we met like that. It was
the greatest piece of luck--"</p>

<p>Maude saw him. Her eyes shone. She was about to stop. Then she
saw Mary Longstaffe whom, by sight, she knew well enough. Her
face sharpened. She looked at him, raised her head defiantly and
walked quickly on.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1><a name="c206">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>

<h1>THE QUARREL</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He caught as though from a long way off the words repeated:
"Well, I must say good night--"</p>

<p>He dragged himself back. "Oh, no, Miss Longstaffe. I'll see
you to your door. It's almost my way home, you know."</p>

<p>She talked perhaps, and perhaps he answered her. He saw men as
trees walking, and the clouds, frustrated by a cloudless sky,
rolled baffled at his feet. He could think only: "I must see her
to-night. I must explain to her. I can't go through the night
without having seen her."</p>

<p>But when he reached the house it was dark and silent. He held
the candle high in the kitchen, but its quavering light showed no
figures, and from all the place there came no sound. He went up
to bed and lay there through the warm night, struggling with his
distress. As always, his window was open and his blind up, but
the stars could not help him. No one from outside could help him.
Maude and he must fight this out alone.</p>

<p>He went, as lovers always do, round and round in a circle. If
he would give up Mary Longstaffe, mind his business and do what
he was told by his superiors, Maude would love him. If he didn't
she wouldn't, and if she didn't. . . . Could he endure it?</p>

<p>That was the question that leapt at him out of the starlight.
Life without Maude. He had faced that question at Pybus and
answered it, but now it was presented to him more immediately.
Life without Maude. Life without Maude. And if he did what he was
told. . . .</p>

<p>After a little troubled sleep in the morning he got up and
went out. It was eight o'clock. They were washing their
door-steps and opening the shops. Old Looney was walking to his
accustomed market-place seat. He smiled, greatly pleased, when he
saw Johanson. The sea had been very quiet down in the caves all
night, just lapping up against the rock. But to-day bad weather
was threatened. One must look out. The line of foam over there
was angry. It couldn't be held back for ever. That wasn't in
nature. And when the undertide had force enough--why, then you'd
see something! Looney chuckled. He hadn't sat there watching all
this time for nothing. He wasn't going to miss it when the day
came.</p>

<p>Johanson stayed at his work, but when the last stout client
had departed, with merely a nod to old Billy, he hurried
away.</p>

<p>He found Judy alone in the kitchen. She stared at him
defiantly; her sleeves were turned up and her brown arms rested
on the table as she looked at him. But he had no time to waste on
Judy.</p>

<p>"Where's Maude?" he said.</p>

<p>"In her room," Judy answered. Then quickly and almost under
her breath, as though she were ashamed, she went on: "Look here,
don't see her to-day. She's cross to-day and liking to be. She's
patting herself on the back because she's got a grievance. Leave
her a day or two and she'll come round."</p>

<p>But he hadn't even answered her. He was up the stairs and
knocking on Maude's door. "Maude! Maude!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. He waited, then he knocked again. "Maude!
Maude! It's me--Johnnie."</p>

<p>At last her voice, cold and sharp, came to him: "Well?"</p>

<p>"Please speak to me for a moment. I beg you."</p>

<p>The door opened and she stood there. "Yes--what is it?"</p>

<p>"Will you not give me ten minutes in the box-room?"</p>

<p>The box-room was a small place on the floor above, round the
corner from Mr. Fletch's bedroom--strange, odd-cornered, with
some dusty bookshelves holding dustier magazines, two old chairs,
a table and a cupboard piled with forgotten relics. Mrs.
Penethen's house was not well suited to lovers. There were two
sitting-rooms, but Miss Midgeley had one and Mrs. Penethen
herself the other. But the lovers were never interrupted in the
box-room. From its curious slanting window you could see out over
the roofs of Polchester to the green country beyond, almost to
the edge of the plain that dropped down to the sea. They had come
to look on it as their own.</p>

<p>She looked at him sternly.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said.</p>

<p>They went up together without a word. She stood in front of
the slanting window, the grey clouds rolling behind her as though
she had evoked them to assist her grandeur. For she was grand.
She was fully conscious that to-day she had the power, the whip
was in her hand. She was pleased that there was going to be a
scene. As with most women when they are in love the thought of
reconciliation after bitter words was intoxicating. She was
already playing her part in that second consoling drama before
the first ruthless one had begun. But beneath this was a
torturing love for him, a determined obstinacy and a raging
jealousy.</p>

<p>He spoke humbly, looking up at her in the way that she liked
best with eyes that adored her. "Please, Maude, whatever we say
we mustn't be angry, either of us. Do you see that? Don't you
agree? No? For us to be angry would be terrible, because we love
one another. We can talk quietly like friends, can't we? You see,
I didn't know she'd be there, Miss Longstaffe, I mean. I knew you
wouldn't like it, our being together. But we met by chance."</p>

<p>"I don't care," she answered, "who you meet. You can be with
who you like for all I care."</p>

<p>"No. No. Of course it matters. Everything matters that gives
you pain." He came to her and put his hand on her sleeve. She
drew away sharply. He pulled himself up, standing close to her,
looking with love into her face, but no more attempting to touch
her. "Maude, listen. Let us be married soon. Very soon. Next week
perhaps. All our troubles come from this, that we are not
together enough, only a little of every day, but when we are
married then we shall know--"</p>

<p>"Married!" she broke in sharply. "A nice time we should have
if we were married, and a pretty sort of husband you'd make if
you went on as you've begun. No, thank you. When I have a husband
he shall be some one I can trust."</p>

<p>"Not that!" he said, flushing. "Not that, Maude! Say what you
please, but I am honest with you. I don't hope you'll deny that.
You <i>must</i> not. Other things I've been wrong about. I've
been stupid, sometimes I don't understand, I'm a foreigner--"</p>

<p>She caught up that word. "Yes, that's it. You're a foreigner.
I don't understand you nor does any one else. You come here and
every one's kind to you, and then you begin to criticise
everything just as though you'd been here all your life. You know
better than anybody, you do. You take advantage of every one's
kindness."</p>

<p>She had worked herself up now finely, and he saw her, in a
flash of understanding, almost exactly as she was. Drawn up
against the window, her lovely hair and eyes, the perfect
proportion of her body under her thin summer frock, the pouting
movement of her lips, her little hands clenched, her young breast
heaving, she looked the child that she partly was. He saw the
child, he adored it, worshipped it, but he saw beneath the child
something ancient and permanent, obstinacy, jealousy, hurt pride.
She was already a woman in her more dangerous attributes. Oh! if
he could but catch the fleeting child and hold it in his arms and
keep it and make it secure! But there was the danger also of his
own obstinacy and anger. She could rouse him and irritate him
more easily than any one else in the world, because he loved her
more.</p>

<p>"Maude, darling," he said quietly. "We are fighting air. What
are we quarrelling about? About nothing at all. Because you saw
me with Miss Longstaffe. I've told you that were an
accident."</p>

<p>"You're not to see her again."</p>

<p>"How do you mean--not see her again?"</p>

<p>"Not see her again--not go near to her, have nothing to do
with her."</p>

<p>He moved his body impatiently.</p>

<p>"We've had all that out before. I can't give up my friends
unless they are false or do you harm intentionally. Can't you see
that, Maude? I don't ask you to give up the Boultewoods, although
I don't like them. What will we be, both of us, when we are
married, if we give up all our freedom? We shall be slaves, the
one of the other."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she retorted furiously. "That's right. It doesn't
seem funny to you to compare my friends, who are decent,
respectable people, with that woman who's a--"</p>

<p>"Stop that!" He caught her wrist. His face stared into hers,
and it was a new face for her to consider, cold and resolved. The
boy's half-na&iuml;ve, half-humorous twist had gone from it. Let
me introduce to you, Miss Penethen, Mr. Hjalmar Johanson from
Copenhagen. Yes, some one quite new. She realised it. She was
excited and frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're hurting!"</p>

<p>He caught her other wrist and held that too.</p>

<p>"You shall drive me away from you if you talk like that,
Maude. . . . Let's have done with this foolishness. We love one
another. What is all this quarrelling over? We will give in to
each other always when we can, but there are some things we must
not ask the other to surrender. Now kiss me and have done with
this."</p>

<p>She broke into passionate crying, crumpled up into his arms,
had her scene of reconciliation that she had desired, but beneath
their demonstrations of love two other persons, darkly habited,
crouching low in their caves, muttered--</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He had, at the same time, other troubles. He paid the first
instalment on the new rooms to Fletch, and was entitled now to
enter upon them when he pleased; he went and looked at them. They
were fine rooms, desolate, with torn wall-paper and
straw-scattered floors. They were fine rooms, and he knew what he
could do with them, but he was conscious that he had taken them
too soon.</p>

<p>Business was falling rather than rising. Of course one must
expect that the summer would be a slack time; it was difficult in
the warm weather to expect people to care about physical
exercises. But the preparations for the autumn season were not
progressing as he wished. He had gained during the last month no
new clients in the town, and enquiries, in answer to his
leaflets, had come in very slackly from the country.</p>

<p>But worse than any of this was some odd change in himself. He
was not working and thinking and planning with his old
enthusiasm. It was as though he had lost much of his interest in
himself and had transferred it to something outside himself. He
stared at his Donatello and Leonardo photographs as though he
would drag their souls from them. He stood in front of the Brytte
Monument in the Cathedral, studying every line and vein of the
beautiful marble as though he had himself worked at it, and again
and again he seemed to feel some one at his side, some eyes upon
him, some hand softly on his shoulder. In these early summer days
Polchester was very beautiful, and he would stand in the streets
gazing up at the roofs as they cut the field of deep sky or down
upon the flags at his feet like another Looney! To make something
beautiful, to form something in the town that would flow like
water in a flagon into his empty spirit. Be practical, man, and
go back to your job! He stood at the window of his office and
looked hungrily out into the market-place. One day he did a mad
thing. It was early evening, and the market-place was a pool of
dim blue water under the crags of the houses. At the foot of the
Market Cross some one had left from the last day's market some
debris, pieces of wood, loose paper. He went down, walked
hurriedly from the door, then, trying to seem casual, walked over
to the Cross, kicked, still, as it were, casually, the paper and
boards away, cleared the foot of the Cross, rubbed his hand
caressingly against the stone, then slowly went back to the
office. Only Looney, sitting on his bench, observed him.</p>

<p>Thirdly, he felt an altered attitude in the town. He had burnt
his boats with Ronder of course. The weather was too warm, the
Canon thought, for massage just at present. Then when Cassidy one
afternoon spoke proudly of Polchester, saying that it was a
perfect town, no town like it in England, Johanson pulled him up
sharply. "Lord, man! Don't you see how beautiful it <i>might</i>
be! How can you be contented? Don't you see. . . ."</p>

<p>But Cassidy didn't see and went away with an aggrieved
expression.</p>

<p>Nor was he, Johanson, as amiable and light-hearted with every
one as he had once been. He was haunted always now by a desire
that they did not share, and so he was a little separated from
them. Sometimes he had an impulse to start to work with his own
hands at some street corner, to clear dust from here, to chip off
with a hammer some ugliness there. He saw himself possessed with
divine power, raising in the space of a night at the top of
Orange Street a statue. Such a statue! A figure more human than
the Donatello "David," more significant and urgent than the
"Winged Victory!"</p>

<p>All the Polcastrians to wake one morning to find it there! And
then how they would start to rebuild their city; first, all the
windows and doors in Orange Street would be cleaned and shining,
then down with the brewery at the market turning, then to limbo
with the Town Hall, now for widening the High Street, that great
sweep up to the Cathedral broad and shining with trees on every
side, then . . .</p>

<p>Laughing, he would come out of his dream. He was almost home.
And walking back he had cut every one. They would notice and
speak of it. No matter, when they saw his statue!</p>

<p>The next phase of his struggle with Maude was desolate and
desperate. Her determination to dominate him was subconsciously
resisted by him with an intensity that he did not himself
recognise. He loved her, but he would not surrender his free
soul: she endeavoured to capture it with every device that she
knew.</p>

<p>He was in some ways casual; call it, if you will, dreamy or
phlegmatic. One morning he left the house and she was not well;
she was in bed; she sent a message to him to come back early that
evening. So he would have done, but a piece of work took him to
the outskirts of the town, a ferocious thunderstorm further
delayed him, he accepted an invitation to dine where he was, and
he did not return to his lodging until after eleven.</p>

<p>All the evening he was thinking of her. He knew that she would
understand, as he would have understood had she been kept
somewhere. But, of course, she did not understand; her anger
seemed to him to be selfish, but what it truly was was feminine.
He had not realised that her femininity (very young and
na&iuml;ve and urgent) demanded altogether different proofs from
his masculinity. What seemed to him overwhelming evidence of his
love was to her nothing; something that was to him ludicrously
trivial was to her everything. Then he had his masculine life. He
liked to be with men, to be jolly, to have men's careless
friendliness around him; it was easy, natural, unburdened with
atmosphere. But she felt that if he were not with her then he
ought to be lonely and to be missing her, and when he came and
showed her very frankly that he had been happy away from her she
was enraged. She was selfish, yes, and greedy and rapacious, but
all this was because she was not sure of him. Had he been one of
her own country people, a native of Polchester, she would have
known instinctively how to deal with him, but Johanson was always
just out of her reach, as he was out of the reach perhaps of
every one in our town.</p>

<p>So that she was in a perpetual state of irritation,
nervousness and longing. He was so often not demonstrative at the
times and in the manner that she wished. He would be thinking of
his work, or perhaps of nothing at all; or he would be eager to
talk about something and would not be caring at that moment to
make love to her. But she wanted to be made love to eternally;
she could never have enough of it. She would invent for herself
the way that he would behave, the things that he would say, how
he would look, and then when he did not behave and speak and look
as she had invented, it was as though he had wilfully deceived
her.</p>

<p>And behind these things there was her jealousy, and there was
the ever-growing fear that in the town he was a failure. People
said that he was swollen-headed after the success of his lecture,
a bit above himself. He waxed impatient with his pupils and
scolded them about their stomachs and double chins. Canon Ronder
shook his head over him, and every Cathedral lady in the town
questioned his open friendship with the immoral Miss
Longstaffe.</p>

<p>He had been heard to say that had he the power he would pull
half of Polchester down. He consorted with the lowest kind of
women in Seatown; it was suspected that he would leave the town
without paying his bills.</p>

<p>All these things and many more were agony to Maude, to whom
Respectability, Popularity and Conventionality were the three
corner-stones of the building of life. She was a snob through
fear and selfishness. Her snobbery was only skin-deep. Had she
married Johanson and gone away with him he would soon have
snatched it from her, but, at present, she cared terribly about
Public Opinion, and Public Opinion was changing about her
lover.</p>

<p>It seemed so little a time since his success. The night of the
lecture had been the turning-point; everything had gone wrong
since that night.</p>

<p>So they turned, like the figures in the Tower in Strindberg's
play, round and round upon one another.</p>

<p>Moments of real comprehension and perfect mutual love wheeled
upon them like flashes from a lighthouse upon a darkening sea.
But the days passed. Their relations became more and more
restless. Maude was now a perpetual image of irritation. He was
for ever doing wrong, not coming when he should, not speaking
enough, speaking too much, never loving her enough, ruining his
future and therefore hers, above all not surrendering to her the
Longstaffes.</p>

<p>The catastrophe, at such a time, at such a place, was
inevitable.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It had its origin, as catastrophes between lovers so often do,
in tiny things, but those tiny things were small symbols of
fundamental differences.</p>

<p>Johanson had bought Maude a little present, an old French
silver box; he had found it in a small shabby shop behind the
market-place. It was curiously worked with Cupids and wreaths of
roses.</p>

<p>He had bought it for her because things had been going so
wrong between them during the last days. He could not understand
it. Some one must be supplying her with false information,
because on every evening of his return she had some new story
against him that, during the day, she had collected--stories of
his carelessness, his unpopularity, his stupidity. There was some
enemy at his back.</p>

<p>Moreover, the incessant scenes were wearying him. They were
interspersed with reconciliations, and every reconciliation
seemed final, as though there could never be a quarrel again, and
then two hours later there would be accusations, recriminations,
miseries again. Every quarrel in one fashion or another attacked
his devotion to the Longstaffes--they beat up, one after another,
like waves against the rock of his loyalty. But here neither his
love nor his pity for her made him yield an inch: he had an
obstinacy about certain things that was as hard as it was dumb.
His love for her through all this trouble did not alter at all.
He realised that her anger with him came from her love for him,
but at moments now a sort of despair of their future together
came over him and then, on the other side, the desolation of his
life without her. . . .</p>

<p>He gave her her present. She was in her room and standing at
her door. He caught her to him and kissed her hair, her eyes, her
mouth. As he did so some strange terror invaded him. He saw at
once the old dissatisfaction in her face. There was going to be a
scene. He was tired, the day had been difficult and the air hot
and thundery. To-night there must not be a scene. He could not
endure it.</p>

<p>She thanked him perfunctorily for the present, barely looked
at it, went in and laid it on her table. Then she returned, and
leaning against her door, her hand on her hip, regarded him
ironically. Her eyes, though, were not ironical. They pleaded
with him as though they said: "Don't mind the rest of me. I love
you, but I'm lost. I'm always saying and doing things I don't
mean and don't want to say and do."</p>

<p>"Is it true that you said that to Mrs. Bond?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bond?" he repeated, bewildered. "What Mrs. Bond?"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> Mrs. Bond?" she answered. "How many Mrs. Bonds
are there in the town? One's enough, I should think."</p>

<p>"Well, what about her?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"What about her? Oh, nothing. Only I wanted to know whether
it's true that you told her to her face that her boy was
hopeless."</p>

<p>"Hopeless? No, I don't think I told her that."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever you told her you've ruined yourself in that
direction. She only happens to be the most important person in
the town, that's all."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he answered, still very gently. "But what's made
you bring all this up to-night?"</p>

<p>"I only thought you'd like to know. It's important, isn't it,
if you make enemies of all the chief people in the place?"</p>

<p>"Maude, Maude!" He went up to her and put his arms around her.
"Aren't you tired of all this? Why can't we be happy together?
What's come over you lately? We were so happy, and we ought to be
happy still."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course, it's all my fault," she broke out, drawing
away from him. "It's never anything you've done. We're supposed
to be going to be married, aren't we, and all the same I've got
to stand by and see you ruin everything without protesting. If
you think I am, you're wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't hope I <i>am</i> ruining everything," he answered her
slowly. "But if I are can't you tell me of it in a friendly way?
Let's be friends, Maude, whatever happens, and not for ever this
anger as though you hated me."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I do hate you," she answered quickly.
"You're so <i>stupid</i> and so <i>conceited</i>. You don't see
what every one else sees, that you'll just have to leave the town
if you go on like this, telling every one what they ought to do.
Well, I'm not going to leave the town, I can tell you, so if you
leave the town you leave me."</p>

<p>And all the time her eyes besought him: "Don't believe this. I
don't mean it. Take me out of this. Help me to escape."</p>

<p>Very distant thunder rolled, as though some one were moving
furniture there in the empty depths of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>"Now," he said sharply, feeling as though the thunder were
rolling in his own head, "you've got to tell me, Maude, who's
putting you up to all this. Who tells you every day things
against me? There's some one behind this--"</p>

<p>"Oh," she answered scornfully. "If it's hearing of all the
stupid things you do you needn't think it's any special person.
One's only got to listen for a moment to any one."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," he answered quietly, "that my affairs were of
so great importance to every one. You must exaggerate in that,
Maude. But it's your friend Mr. Hogg who tells you these things.
I know it quite well."</p>

<p>"If you know it, why do you ask me?" Maude answered. "At any
rate he's fond of me and doesn't want to see me give myself away
for nothing."</p>

<p>Hogg, as he had long known, was his real enemy in the place.
Any mention of him roused some cold, deliberate anger in his
heart, the worst and most dangerous element in him.</p>

<p>"We have indeed gone far from one another," he said sternly.
"If you can listen every day to lies from a man like that about
me, how can we trust one another? What has <i>happened</i> to
you, Maude? How <i>can</i> you be disloyal, you . . . ?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered furiously. "You can put my bad man against
your bad woman. You can leave me for hours because you want to be
with a woman who's disgraced herself, and has the cheek to come
back here and stare every one in the face. That's what you do and
then you dare to talk to me!"</p>

<p>He caught her, held her for a moment rigid in his hands, then
shook her, crying to her: "You stop that! You stop that! You
drive me crazy! You've no decency! You want a good beating,
that's what you want."</p>

<p>He let her go; she stumbled, caught at the door, ran back into
her room, banging the door behind her. But a moment later it had
opened again and she appeared there quivering, shaking with
passion. They were both so angry that they did not see one
another, but only images of themselves distorted.</p>

<p>She screamed at him: "You brute! You've beaten . . . You've
beaten . . . hurt . . . I'm done with you, you cad. You're a
foreigner. You don't belong here. You don't belong here. We all
hate you here! You'd kill me one day. Yes, you would. And then
you'd be hung. Yes, for killing me. You cowardly brute! No
Englishman. . . . No Englishman. . . . It's not safe with you.
I'll never be alone with you again. You're not safe. No
Englishman. . . ."</p>

<p>She rushed past him down the stairs. He followed her.</p>

<p>He saw in a confused mist the old kitchen, Mrs. Penethen,
Judy, Miss Midgeley and Fletch. And he saw Maude in the midst of
them crying out.</p>

<p>He watched the ring of startled faces, the eyes amazed, the
heavy motionless bodies. He heard her voice, shrill, sharp like a
parrot's screech.</p>

<p>"He hit me! Mother, he hit me! Don't let him touch me!"</p>

<p>Then he saw her, the mist clearing, the kitchen clock and the
china plates jumping at him, make a movement, snatch something
from her hand, and throw it furiously (and awkwardly as women
throw). He knew it was the ring (the funny old silver one) that
he had given her.</p>

<p>"I'm done with him! I'll never speak to him again! You're all
witness. He beat me. . . . I'm done with him."</p>

<p>She rushed past him back up the stairs.</p>

<p>He stood there for a moment looking at the stupid faces. Then
he went and got his hat from the wall and without saying a word
to any one went out.</p>

<h1><a name="c207">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>

<h1>GABRIELLE MIDGELEY'S DIARY--III</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Old women. Old women. Old women. Some one has written an
article about them in the <i>Spectator.</i> How old they are. How
nice they are. Nicer than old men. That is what swiftly I am
becoming--nicer than some nasty old man. I am running into old
age like an express train. I haven't a minute to wait. No station
to change at. Nor is it true to say, as approaching-old-age women
always say, "I feel as young as I did at twenty." I don't.
Sometimes I feel nine hundred and ninety-nine and a half. I feel
so to-night.</p>

<p>They are playing billiards in the Cathedral. One can hear the
click of the balls. But where do the Cathedral noises come from?
Ghosts? Brandon and the Black Bishop amusing one another? I am so
old that I can afford to believe in fairy-tales.</p>

<p>The life has gone from this house so completely that one can
listen to the Cathedral noises as easily as one pleases. When
Johanson left this house, for two of us--for Judy and
myself--everything went with him. I shall change my lodging, I
fancy--or leave the town altogether. Sentiment? Not entirely. He
<i>had</i> a life, spiritual as well as physical, that gave zest
to my old withered turnip of a soul. And the love of the two of
them held such promise. I could have beaten them both after that
wretched scene. Why could he not have stayed? Next day she would
have been another creature. He might have excused her youth and
vanity and silliness. But I must be fair to him. I think he did.
Before he moved his things to his new lodgings he came here to
say good-bye. He meant to win her still. To be away for a week
and then to return. She had been too sure of him, he thought, and
now she would miss him. I'm not too certain. I begged him not to
leave her. She has bad friends here who egg on her vanity all the
time. When he is there he can beat the lot of them, but when he
is away she sees him as something foreign and queer--and somebody
who has insulted her. That's her word. She came and talked such
nonsense to me on <i>that</i> theme that at last I drove her out
of my room. I told her a few home truths first, though.</p>

<p>I told her that she was giving up, for a miserable petty
jealousy, one of the finest, most generous and noble human beings
that ever descended from a monkey. Sentimental? I was sentimental
all right. As I talked I saw a kind of heroic figure, one of the
Donatello statues he's so fond of, and as unlike the real Harmer
John as may be. Never mind. She listened to me. She even cried a
little. Yes, and she even said that she would never love any one
again. And she went further than that. She said that love made
her uncomfortable and that he had such funny ideas. It was better
not to love a foreigner, perhaps. Foreigner. Foreigner.
Foreigner. I could have smacked her. When his heart was as warm
and true and honest as this Johanson's, what was she bothering
about his foreign blood for? There were plenty of Englishmen,
yes, and Polcastrians too, who had more foreign hearts than he
had. Yes, that was all right--of course he was a good man and
kind too--but she was frightened of him all the same. His
<i>ideas.</i> Now there was a thing. What was he doing here
making himself so unpopular? It might be silly of her, but really
she couldn't be the wife of an unpopular man. And he didn't care
whom he offended--he didn't really. Mrs. Bond or Canon Ronder, it
was all the same. I broke in upon her there. How <i>dared</i> she
talk of loving him? Love? Did she call that love? Why, she didn't
know what love was. She interrupted me then. Oh yes, she knew
what love was very well. And she loved him. And she would never
love anybody else. She was sure of that. But she thought that
perhaps she wasn't meant to feel that kind of love. There was
something unnatural about it. She wasn't a very grand person. She
never would be. She knew her faults well enough. She'd only make
him unhappy, always disapproving of the things that he wanted to
do. She would never understand him. She ought to marry some one
much more commonplace and ordinary, but no one would ever again
make her feel as Johanson had made her feel. And she was glad.
She didn't want to feel that way.</p>

<p>She wouldn't see him any more because if she saw him, even for
a minute, it would all begin again. She did hope that she
wouldn't see him in the town.</p>

<p>Queer girl. But then there was something in what she said. She
looked so pretty as she stood there. And so tiresome. And a
little vulgar. She's quite right--she isn't good enough for
him--but without her--what will he do without her? What will he
do in that lonely lodging? I have to wax myself to my chair or
I'd be running off to see after him. Mrs. Penethen's been often.
But she has a right. I'll take him some books one day, pay my
proper polite little call.</p>

<p>Judy's the third of us. Yesterday she coolly asked me what we
intended to do about it. What we intended to do about what? Why,
Mr. Johanson. Did we know that he was in that wretched lodging
all alone with no one to see to him? Did no one care what
happened to him? It wasn't her business, but she hated to see
people so false. Pretending to be a friend of some one and then
deserting them when their luck was out. Oh, she named no names.
But all the town was the same. Taking him up one minute and
dropping him the next. She as good as said that I was as bad as
the rest. She positively looked as if she hated the sight of me,
and then stalked out of the room with her head in the air.</p>

<p>The next thing that happened to me was a meeting with that
dear, lovable creature, Mrs. Bond. And where? Of all places in
the world--the Circulating Library. My old flame, old Professor
Henning. Professor of what? Of languages, and now, penniless,
eaten up by his white beard, stamp-collecting in his dirty little
lodging, starving his body and increasingly liberating his soul.
Never mind about him, but, as this Diary knows, I like him. I
like the way his eyes flame out of his beard and his long white
hands, so clean, so thin and so aristocratic. The Circulating
Library is always our rendezvous.</p>

<p>We can sit there in its hinder end keeping company with Godwin
and Barham and Miss Ferrier and Jane Porter without too much
consciousness of our advancing years. Dust and bookworms and one
or two bright ideas--because really the Professor and I are very
witty together. We laugh consummately. Or rather I laugh and he
crumbles in his beard.</p>

<p>Miss Leeson, the librarian, is a nice young thing. <i>So</i>
young. Clean and shining like a new penny. She is kind and
considerate to the aged too, and eats sugared almonds out of a
little paper bag, and we hear from our corner her teeth crunching
and her sighs over the Corelli that she is investigating. I like
the place, the sun (when it shines) making Jacob's ladders out of
the curtain of dust and the spiders spinning webs over the faces
of dear, dead authors. And I slip a bun into the Professor's
pocket.</p>

<p>Two days ago I was discreetly waiting and listening to Miss
Leeson's gay little tinkle, the door opened and there was my dear
Mrs. Bond. Why do I detest that woman so thoroughly, and
especially in that she is always so polite to me? And why is she
polite? I am nothing. I am less than nothing. I am less than that
again. And yet she is polite. Because, of course, she intends to
get something out of me. But what? She regards me perhaps as some
one just a little international. Because of my London life and
because I have published books. She hopes, maybe, that one day I
shall put her into one. I shall, and she won't recognise herself.
That will be her tragedy. When she greets me, she always looks me
over, as though she were wondering whether she could possibly
endure for another minute acquaintance with a creature whose
appearance is so quaint as mine. She pulls herself together. You
can see her valiantly determining that she won't be put off. No,
she won't be. But why won't she be? Why make the struggle? Most
mysterious.</p>

<p>She is always so smartly dressed and yet not beautifully. Too
much. Too little. And her face is too soft. Without bones. And
too pink. The curls above her white forehead are too black and
too hard. They gleam like metal. But how friendly she is! She
held my hand in both of hers, while her eyes, surveying my odd
costume and my strawberry features, revealed their accustomed
struggle. Her nobility won, and so, accepting one, she launched
into her stream.</p>

<p>Where was I living now? I always tell her and she always
forgets. Why, of course, in those same rooms. And then--why,
surely yes--was she not right? That was the very place where Mr.
Johanson had lodged. <i>And</i> was lodging no longer.</p>

<p>Too sad. Such a pity. Such a nice man and such a disaster.
What was sad and what was a pity and what was a disaster? Why,
Mr. Johanson. She understood him, she fancied, better than most
people here. Because he was not English. She had seen so much of
the world. She had been surprised that a man of high character,
as she understood him to be, should have given up the girl to
whom he was engaged--and a nice, pretty girl too--for--well, one
must not believe everything but some one else apparently was
involved. One only heard half the truth about these things, and,
for her part, she defended Mr. Johanson wherever she went, but he
had apparently been very rude to Canon Ronder, which was, people
felt, ungrateful of him when the Canon had done so much for him.
But she <i>liked</i> him. She didn't want to see him go to
pieces. That nice, pretty girl would have been so good for him?
Why had he left her?</p>

<p>A question at last. I can remain impassive for ever. A sort of
deadness. She felt it. It made her uncomfortable and so she asked
her question. I answered it. I told her in the sweetest way
possible that she was a liar. Oh! she didn't know that I was
telling her that, of course. She thought that I was paying her
compliments. She <i>knew,</i> of course, that I knew. And living
in the same house. She had always felt just what I felt, that he
was one of the <i>honestest</i> men--one of the truest <i>. .</i>
. and when people said these things. Yes, there was something
boyish about him. So attractive. And when people said these
things. . . . For instance they said . . . I stopped her there. I
didn't want to know what they said. No, naturally. But opinion
had changed. They had all liked him so at first. He had become
all in a moment so independent--as though he knew better than
anybody else. She liked that strength of character. But, of
course, for a foreigner to judge everybody! The English character
was something all to itself, was it not? And could a foreigner .
. . ? That was the question.</p>

<p>And on that question we left it. She stared at me as though
she was wondering most truly <i>why</i> I existed and then passed
on to the bright Miss Leeson to secure the book that was being
kept for some one else, but would be yielded to her simply
because of her autocratic power.</p>

<p>She leaves devastating ruin behind her. One knows the
people--men and women--who do that. One cannot listen to them for
five minutes, and they at their sweetest, without sniffing death
and destruction. How and why do they do it? Is it a kind of
jealousy of the human race or a sense of their own unworthiness
that impels them to pull down others to their own level? In the
old London days there was Forrest the novelist, son of a
clergyman too--how smilingly he hated his fellow humans, how
eagerly he sniffed out mean motives, how greedily he listened to
detractions! And dear Mabel Barmes with her biting tongue, her
clever newspaper criticism and her over-written novels, how her
eyes would shine and her sallow cheeks faintly flush when some
one came up for condemnation! Why do they like it? Where's their
fun?</p>

<p>Anyway, I know that Mrs. Bond, curse her, made me on this
occasion profoundly miserable. Foolish of me. Didn't I realise
her by this time and understand her false and mean little soul?
Nevertheless, the sense of her power depressed me. My poor Harmer
John--so helpless against her! I might encourage myself by
remembering that in the end, his character against hers, she's
snuffed out like a candle! But, in the meantime, the things that
she can do!</p>

<p>Enter my dear old Professor. We retired quietly to our spiders
and philosophical discussions. Considering the Infinite
extinguishes the Bonds, but how few souls have time enough!</p>

<p>And so I've paid my visit. With my books under my arm I
climbed the stairs and found the room. He's at the top of that
house that hangs over the descent to Seatown and swings there in
the wind like a weather-cock. He has two rooms, and the
sitting-room is all cuckoo-clock, plush divan, wool mats, flowers
and fruit under glass. Amidst these relics of a happier age I
found him sitting, his coat off, elbows planted on the table,
looking out between the geraniums at a sky that was as green as a
primrose leaf. He might have been in Daddy Wordsworth's little
boat:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Away we go--and what care we<br>
 For treasons, tumults and for wars?<br>
 We are as calm in our delight<br>
 As is the crescent moon so bright<br>
 Among the scattered stars.<br>
<br>
 Up goes my Boat among the stars<br>
 Through many a breathless field of light,<br>
 Through many a long blue field of ether,<br>
 Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her;<br>
 Up goes my little Boat so bright."</p>

<p>Yes, he was as remote and as tranquil I would have said; but
at the sound of my coming in he turned and I saw, by the flush on
his cheek, that he was hoping for some news from me, that he
thought that I wouldn't have come if I . . .</p>

<p>And then he had that particular courtesy and tenderness that
is so peculiarly his. Old-fashioned, I fancy. I am a plain,
bitter-tongued old woman, attractive to no one, but he always
treats me as though I were Queen of the Andes. He brought me one
of those chairs with warm, adhesive seats, and took away my
shabby ulster, and seemed so happy to see me--almost as happy as
I was to see him. He looked different. Older. I asked him why he
hadn't come back to us and when he was coming. He sighed and then
said that he had meant to return at the end of the first week,
and that then Mrs. Penethen had been to see him and told him that
Maude was so strange that she thought that he had better wait a
little. He had been to the house and had tried to see Maude and
had failed. Could I tell him anything or advise him, perhaps? His
unhappiness came through then and I saw, in a flash, that he had
been having a desperate time. I don't know why, but I got in the
break of his voice, as he asked his question, a sense of his love
for her far stronger than anything that I had had before. "I am
very bad without her, Miss Midgeley," he said. "I have
temptations to go to her and do everything she asks, give up my
friends, all . . . but we wouldn't be happy that way. I know it.
But I am very bad without her. The nights are so long. I miss her
terrible."</p>

<p>I told him of my talk with her and I advised him not to wait
any longer, but to insist on seeing her. She wasn't in a state to
be left alone. There were others influencing her. She loved him,
I was sure; or at least she was as near to it as her nature,
timorous, selfish and vain, permitted her. I tried to say
something then about her being unworthy of him, that he would
find some one else. . . . He broke in upon me there and poured
out to me his picture of her. How touching, and, at the end, how
true! He saw her just as she was, but he saw her also as she
would be if he cared for her enough! That is true of Maude. She's
beguiling in her possibilities. He gave me proof after proof of
her subconscious longing to be taken by him and held against the
enemy like some fortress. But how was he to take her without
surrendering his own fortress first?</p>

<p>Ridiculous similes. We had just talked like two friends up
there in that high little room with the sky turning to crystal
and the geraniums smelling woollier and woollier. My first friend
for years. He is both boy and man, so that I am, with him, both
mother and friend. Mother! I, the most sterile of women! Yes, he
has taken from me a little of my sterility and I will bless him
for that to my death. He has the divine gift of tenderness and
compassion. Nothing is mean to him nor ignoble. If he hates, it
is some poison in the nature not the poisoned soul that he
detests.</p>

<p>And he is so unconscious in his goodness and kindliness of
heart, that one wonders why no one has ever drawn his attention
to those qualities!</p>

<p>He seemed to me as I talked to him to be a little dazed. He
told me quite frankly that his experience of unpopularity was new
to him and bewildered him. It was so short a time for the change.
It bewildered him but did not frighten him. His mind seemed to be
set on some new purpose, and this new purpose would make him
happy later on. Not his work. I asked him about his classes and
the rest, and he scarcely seemed to care. He meant to be busy, he
said, about something that had nothing to do with himself; he
meant to get himself right out of it.</p>

<p>Oneself. Oneself. Wouldn't it be fun to be rid of oneself or
at least to be so completely occupied with something else that
oneself never occurred to one? But the room was dark. One
couldn't see the geraniums any longer. I left him urging him not
to leave Maude alone for long. There were Boultewoods and Hoggs
and all sorts waiting for their chance. . . .</p>

<p>I snivelled a little going down the stairs. He seemed to me so
<i>very</i> lonely.</p>

<p>He has seen Maude. No success. She insisted on her mother
being there. She wouldn't say anything except that she thought
they would never do for one another. Quite polite. Trying to be a
lady. Her mother longing to whip her. Harmer John very patient,
eating her up with his eyes. Then quietly he went away. . . .</p>

<h1><a name="c208">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>

<h1>SEATOWN FANTASY</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Johanson's position was now extremely precarious. When he had
arrived in our town he had saved a few hundred pounds, but he had
put them into his business. His expenses had, after the initial
outlay, been slight and the business good, but then came the time
when he developed his advertising in the country, purchased new
instruments for his exercises and paid Fletch the advance for the
new rooms. He had never been very wise about money, but spent
what came to him as it came. He had always been generous to the
point of folly, but after his engagement to Maude he tried to
realise that he had new responsibilities and must save. But this
business of saving seemed to him to have something mean about it.
There were so many in the town who were hard-hit. He himself had
been so fortunate. He owed them something for his luck.</p>

<p>But he had not thought of the difference that the summer would
make. He lost one client after another; finally he decided to
close his place until the beginning of September. Billy and son
went on a discontented holiday.</p>

<p>It was strange to find himself idle, and this coincided with
his quarrel with Maude and departure from Mrs. Penethen's. He sat
up in his high room, looked out at the clouds, and waited.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. What came to him was Seatown.</p>

<p>A very hot August that year. And before Seatown, plus the hot
August, came to him, he was compelled to face something very new
and strange, a surprising and menacing loneliness. Menacing
because it seemed to promise in the future something even worse
than its present performance. He had never been lonely before.
Even in the worst days of his childhood there had been people
about. Now it was as though, by some mysterious device, a wall of
cotton-wool had been let down between himself and Polchester.
There was silence on every side of him, and only blank faces
turned his way.</p>

<p>His landlady, Mrs. Prespin, had the blankest face of any. That
was because she was preoccupied with her mother, a very, very
ancient lady, over a hundred or so they say, and so bitter and
melancholy that, as the maid of all work darkly muttered, "She'd
be 'appier dead." She was, however, not only alive, but also her
daughter Mrs. Prespin's whole existence. Where Mr. Prespin was no
one knew nor cared, and had not the ancient Mrs. Mathias existed,
Mrs. Prespin might have looked about her and asked herself
whether it was wise to admit into her beautiful rooms so
dangerous a foreigner as Mr. Johanson.</p>

<p>But when he, after climbing the stairs, having remembered his
earlier vision of this house, enquired for rooms, Mrs. Prespin
was so deeply occupied in heating milk for her mother that she
could but answer, "Yes, that rooms were there," without once
looking at her prospective lodger. Mrs. Prespin squinted and
found it difficult to look at anybody; she was white and long,
with a high bony horselike head, but her devotion to her mother
made her almost beautiful. The surprising thing about old Mrs.
Mathias was that, in spite of her hundred years, she was not
bed-ridden, but would make sudden dramatic appearances, her
withered head wrapped up in a red shawl, her feet in clinging,
grey, tapping slippers, would push herself half through a door,
look in with her red-rimmed eyes, move her toothless gums, and
disappear again.</p>

<p>So that Mrs. Mathias and Mrs. Prespin were not, by any means,
what Mrs. Penethen and Miss Midgeley had been. They were, in
fact, exactly nothing at all.</p>

<p>He increased, too, his loneliness by that sensitiveness that
all men who are suffering under unpopularity feel.</p>

<p>He did not go to the Longstaffes as he had formerly done,
because he thought that Tom might not wish his name to be
connected any longer with Mary's. He had, innocently, made
scandal enough in that direction. But he missed Tom Longstaffe
terribly.</p>

<p>It was, of course, not seeing Maude that, during these first
weeks, drove him almost to madness. Yes, to madness; for he would
walk his bedroom floor for hours at night struggling to forget
and only more hopelessly remembering, and he would pierce the
hurrying clouds with his gaze fixing her there in their woolly
folds, seeing her eyes, her hair, hearing her voice laughing
beyond the sun.</p>

<p>Was she also thus missing him? Strangely, although again and
again he had spoken of their love for one another, he had never
been sure of hers--he was not sure now. She would miss the happy
times but would lazily congratulate herself on her escape from
the difficult ones. But there were things that she <i>must</i>
remember--evening half-hours beneath their sheltering tree,
embraces, whispered desires, loving confidences, things that she
<i>must . . .</i></p>

<p>And then the long white face of Mrs. Prespin: "Well, mother's
a bit better to-day, thank you, Mr. Johnson. Yes, she just went
off for an hour or two, which is a thing to be thankful for at
her age. Mother always says: 'If I get an hour or two these days
I'm thankful,' but she really is a bit better than yesterday,
thank you. The heat affects her, of course, but she's wonderful,
considering, I do think. It's just the pain in the back that
troubles her, but, as I always tell her, you must expect
something when you're over a hundred."</p>

<p>You must indeed, and what ancient Mrs. Mathias expected nobody
knows, but the tip-tap of her slippers about the floor was like
mice skipping behind the wainscot--some company after all for a
lonely man.</p>

<p>From his windows he could see the whole of the town--below him
Seatown, the river, the fields rising to the wooded hills; on the
other side (screwing your neck round the window) the narrow
street winding up to the market-place, a glimpse of the High
Street, and then the Cathedral towers striding above the roofs
across the sky.</p>

<p>Directly below him was the street, hesitating an instant
before its downward plunge. Just in front of the house it
widened, having no buildings opposite but only a thick wall,
leaning on which visitors, idlers and philosophers might gaze
down over the rock to the waters of the Pol, the Seatown huddled
encampment, and the farther country.</p>

<p>To the right of this wall Johanson noticed on his second or
third day a deserted patch of grass, some grey stone and a
forlorn tree that huddled into the wall's corner. It was the
desolation of this tree that first caught Johanson's attention,
the way that with a sort of desperate despair it clutched the
wall with its arms and protested in waves of exasperation against
every wind. Then, going out into the hot August light, the patch
of shade beneath the tree was inviting. He walked across the
street to investigate. He found an old broken seat worn with rain
and washed free of paint, cracked and bird-soiled. The grass was
thick and tangled; to the right of the tree, and almost hidden by
the overhanging wall, was something else, some old deserted
monument of grey stone.</p>

<p>He did not stay then to investigate it further, but strangely
enough that night when he was lying in bed he thought of it. He
had been lying there restlessly, turning over and over, his heart
aching for Maude. His heart beat wildly: he seemed to be on the
edge of some foolish action, as though he might dress and go out
and beat on the door of Mrs. Penethen's house. He did not know
what he might not do. The night was so hot, he had had now a
fortnight of this loneliness and longings; his nerves were
stretched to their limit.</p>

<p>It seemed so impossible that only a month ago they had been so
close and so intimate, and that now they were separated by this
wall of misunderstanding.</p>

<p>When he had talked to her the other day he had seen on her set
and determined face the presence of some obstinate resolve.
Although her mother had been there he had got up suddenly, gone
across to her, put his arms around her and said: "Maude, Maude,
come back to me." He had felt her body tremble, and for a moment
her hand had fluttered on to his; nevertheless, she had said in a
small remote voice: "Will you promise never to see the
Longstaffes again, then?"</p>

<p>After that it was hopeless. There was a blind resolved
obstinacy there that had behind it some subconscious reasoning.
Mrs. Penethen tried to do what she could. There was nothing to be
done. Maude would only return on her own conditions, and they
were conditions to which Johanson would never agree.</p>

<p>But to-night the heat seemed to strangle his brain. His body
was damp with sweat. He jumped up, flung off his pyjamas, and
walked naked about the room. It was then in the depth of his
loneliness and unhappiness that he thought of the tree, the grey
stone, the wall. He went to the open window and looked out to the
splendid night fiery with stars. The Cathedral clock struck
half-past three. The town slept like a dead man; the blue haze
that enwrapped it quivered with the coming dawn, and there, pale
like the skeleton of a tree, was that for which he was looking.
It seemed friendly to him, to be as lonely as he.</p>

<p>He put on some clothes, went quietly down the creaking stairs,
lifted the chain of the house door, and stepped out into the
beautiful night, soft with southern softness, quiet and still
with the silence of mysterious preparation.</p>

<p>He crossed the road, bent over the seat, felt its poor
neglected roughness with his hand, and then, stepping into the
rough tangled grass, looked at the grey stone. In the dim veiled
light he could see but little; with his hand he pulled away some
weeds and then some clinging ivy.</p>

<p>Kneeling down, he found that here was something round and
smooth; very dimly he could discern carved figures. Pulling away
more of the ivy, he saw at last that this was a deserted fountain
filled with earth, and, on the earth a broken figure, the upper
half of a Satyr holding a wine cup. He took out the Satyr's head
and arm and held them against the sky, then carefully he replaced
them upon the soil that filled the circle of the fountain. His
hand rested for a moment on the grey stone; then mysteriously
comforted, he returned softly to his room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To those who know Polchester now in these chilly post-war days
it will seem incredible that so recently as 1907 we should have
possessed anything as medieval as the old Seatown. The modern
river-side street with its neat line of workmen's cottages and
gardens, its border of young trees and its low wall of pearl-grey
stone, is altogether admirable. To quote the <i>Polchester
Courier</i> for March 10, 1924: "We have here something of which
we may be proud--modern and yet beautiful; practical and yet
dignified; modest and yet artistic. The pretty gardens rich with
lovely flowers, the fine asphalted road, the raised walk that
gives the visitor an opportunity of surveying the beauties of
Nature in a practical and commodious manner, the cottages
themselves with their pale stone, their dignified outlines, their
perfect sanitation--these are things, we repeat, of which the
Polchester citizen may well be proud."</p>

<p>And the Polchester citizen <i>is</i> proud. I am proud. We are
all proud. It is only a pity, perhaps, that we had not the
opportunity of being proud a little earlier. The Polchester that
Johanson found was divided into three very distinct camps--there
were the citizens, the rebels, and the ruffians, and all these
three parties were huddled together within an area of a mile or
so.</p>

<p>The citizens, who considered themselves the chief of the
Polchester kingdom, consisted of four or five old families who
had been among the earliest settlers in Glebeshire. These
families worked honestly in the town, for the most part at
net-making, and kept themselves entirely apart from the other
Seatown population.</p>

<p>The rebels were the loafers, and numbered the most here. They
were the scavengers, the idlers, the wasters, drifting in from
the sea, the country farms, other towns such as Drymouth and
Buquay. There were some foreigners among them, but for the most
part they were pasty-faced, lean-shanked and furtive-eyed, and
lived by mean theft and petty larceny.</p>

<p>The ruffians were the dashing ones, the romantics, the
buccaneers. They were less in number than the rebels, but
infinitely more energetic and dominating. They were gypsies in
origin; and dirty vagabonds though they were, their rich brown
colouring, large black eyes, jet black hair, told a story. It
would need a George Borrow to investigate sufficiently their
beginning, but on some old day some caravan had stumbled into
Polchester streets, had rested for the night, and permanently
remained. The ruffians were the enemies of all civilised society.
They flourished in those happy days before the word Bolshevism
was known, nor had even the most learned among them heard the
blessed and holy name of Karl Marx; they followed perhaps rather
the pattern of Robin Hood and the late beloved Turpin, save that
they had no grace of charity or humour.</p>

<p>They had no saving grace of any kind, being cruel, mean,
treacherous, superstitious, disloyal, avaricious, morally
debased, and of a physical filthiness. But they had romantic
names--Romilly, Carne, Santin, Escarpia, Froment. Johanson had
already encountered one of them, Bloody Bill Romilly, a creature
six foot four in height and black-bearded.</p>

<p>On Harmer John's first visit to Seatown, as I have recorded,
he stumbled by accident into the room of a woman who had a sick
child. He sat beside this child, stroked its forehead, talked a
little to the mother, and went away. But the child at once
improved and soon was out of danger. There may have been some
virtue in the touch of Johanson's hand--there are all around us
people who have a gift of this kind--but I should imagine that
there was a much stronger virtue in Johanson's heart. He always
loved children so passionately that it would be strange indeed if
they did not feel something pass from him to them.</p>

<p>The mother, who was the beaten and down-trodden wife of one of
the ruffians--a sandy-haired blackguard known as the
Sandpiper--lost no time in proclaiming the miracle. It was not
odd that it should have seemed like a miracle to her. A stranger
comes into her place from nowhere, speaks with an odd accent, is
taller and bigger than any one she has ever seen, sits down
beside her sick child and cures it, and vanishes. Was it not
natural that she should speak of it?</p>

<p>Nor did he become less of a miracle when he appeared again. He
came on several occasions, bringing little gifts for the child
with him.</p>

<p>He would sit there and talk for an hour perhaps, and mostly
with the child Emily Maud, who of course adored him. The mother
did not talk but sat there with her eternal sewing-machine--like
the woman in Hood's poem, she made shirts--and watched them.</p>

<p>The Sandpiper arrived once, stared for a long time without
saying anything, and went out again. Women sometimes came to the
door and stood there looking. One day a woman asked him whether
he would come and look at her little boy. The doctor could do
nothing with him. Johanson went and found an attic so filthy that
the child was almost invisible.</p>

<p>When discovered he seemed to be suffering from little but
vermin and bad food; he was a boy like a blackberry, with a merry
eye. He, with a mangy dog, attached himself to Johanson, would
watch for him at the corner of the street, and even on one
occasion ventured as far as Johanson's lodging. His name was
Husky, an allusion to a queer throaty voice that he had, and his
dog was called Charlie.</p>

<p>When the news of this second marvellous cure spread about the
excitement was immense. His town nickname, Harmer John, caught
the Seatown fancy, and it was to be heard everywhere. Ladies in
various stages of undress waited for him on stairs, at doors,
down the street, and begged him in hoarse voices to cure colds,
coughs, toothaches, asthma, rheumatism, internal pains of every
kind, and many quite unmentionable Seatown complaints. He tried
to explain to them that he could cure nothing, and that the first
thing for them to do was to sluice their floors with water, open
the windows, and drink less. Of course they would not listen. He
made at once enemies to the death of the two local witches,
Mother Harper and old Mrs. Clay.</p>

<p>Mother Harper was long and thin, with grey wispy hair and
protruding teeth; old Mrs. Clay was bent so double that she did
not look like a human at all, and she walked leaning on a stick
just as a witch should.</p>

<p>He also made an enemy of the local doctor, Rufus, a fat,
drunken man, white-haired and purple-nosed.</p>

<p>When he found that his visits were causing a disturbance, that
the children and dogs clung to his heels, the women collected
about him and the men leaned against the wall and scowled at him
(he was not popular with the Seatown men; they hated him from the
first) he came no more. For several weeks Seatown did not see
him, and his only connection with it was the mysterious
appearance of young Husky and Charlie at his heels in various
parts of the town hitherto unblessed by his presence. Then came
the trouble with Maude, and he took up his lodging at the Seatown
gates.</p>

<p>From that moment Seatown haunted him. He no longer cared for
the consequences; do something for that abandoned place he must.
It was unfortunate that by the time he began his regular visits
to Seatown his glory in the upper town had begun to fade.
Although the Seatown inhabitants cared defiantly less than
nothing for the opinion of the outside world, they were snobs
like the rest of us. Every one in Seatown very soon knew that
Harmer John had treated his girl wrong, that the clergy thought
badly of him, and that he had said that he wished to pull Seatown
to pieces. Half the place hated him then, and the other half
looked on him as a magician who was to be justified only by
successful miracles.</p>

<p>A few, the mother of Emily Maud and one or two others,
worshipped him; certain children and dogs followed him devotedly
wherever he went. The others, instructed by their elders, shouted
at him and called after him abusively.</p>

<p>There was a nice young clergyman, Grahame, whose especial
spiritual province Seatown was, and Johanson might have found him
a fine ally had he not unfortunately gone just now to Buquay on
his August holiday. It need scarcely be suggested that he was
badly in want of it.</p>

<p>Johanson was discovering in himself new elements. He had
always been obstinate, but something was in him now that was more
than obstinacy--something hard and almost remorseless. So far as
Seatown went he could no longer say that he did not wish to
change people's opinions. He did not care whose feelings he hurt,
how many enemies he made, if he could alter the Seatown
conditions. The filth, the smells, the broken windows, the
overcrowding, the incredible immorality consequent on that
overcrowding, the degradation and despair--the complacency of the
Upper Town about these things stirred a deep and unchanging
anger.</p>

<p>There is nothing in our English life, perhaps, more amazing to
the visiting foreigner than the close juxtaposition in towns both
big and small of absolute poverty and degradation and comfort and
security. Very much has been done during the last twenty years to
improve the housing conditions of our towns, but in 1907
Polchester was not the only place in England with a Seatown. Only
in Glebeshire there has always been a strain of foreign blood in
the people that gives them something alien, picturesque, if you
like, and also dangerous.</p>

<p>Seatown had a sharp and brilliant colour like some exotic
flower.</p>

<p>Our Town Councillors and aristocracy were not easy about the
Seatown conditions--the trouble in 1902 had showed that--but once
begin to change things and you stirred up a whole world of
responsibilities, slanders, accusations and denials. Anything
better just now than a public scandal--and just now was
always.</p>

<p>Hogg and others, whose business it was to see that Seatown
remained medieval (there were many things and persons in the
present Seatown very useful to Hogg) knew that once scandal burst
consequences might be disastrous for them, were very active in
helping the Upper Town to forget the Lower, and the Upper Town
was not unreluctant.</p>

<p>Then comes this abominable foreigner. . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Sandpiper was one of the first to express publicly his
dislike of "this bloody foreigner." Having one day knocked his
wife's face in because she upset his beer, and being confronted
by Johanson while he was resting from his gentle exercise,
Johanson kicked him out of the room and tumbled him down the
smelly stairs.</p>

<p>From this moment he, so far as Johanson was concerned,
physically disappeared. It was as though when he landed on the
bottom stairs he vanished through the ancient boards into the
bosom of Mother Earth--physically disappeared, but not
spiritually. That was, as Johanson now discovered, the very
oddest thing about Seatown--that it was impossible to put your
finger directly upon any one, but that you walked as though in
some place of ghosts. It was as though the mists that gathered
about the Pol, morning and evening, enveloped so much more than
their own slow waters and low-hanging fields.</p>

<p>Hogg, for instance, was never to be seen there, and yet his
presence was ever to be felt. He did not once during these weeks
encounter Johanson, and yet Johanson was never free of his
presence.</p>

<p>Johanson had thought at first that he would bring together one
or two of the principal Seatown residents and form with them a
little band of reformers--but the clergyman was away, the doctor
hated him, and--there was no one else.</p>

<p>There was literally no one else! Try and put your finger on
any one and he at once disappeared! Only idle women, children,
lounging loafers, foul-mouthed buccaneers, and dogs remained.
Young Husky remained and Charlie and Emily Maud--and Bloody Bill
Romilly.</p>

<p>This last, as Johanson soon perceived, was deputed his
principal harasser. Romilly's large black-bearded lumping body
was soon at every quarter. The Sandpiper and others were
doubtless not far away, but they did not appear.</p>

<p>Johanson believed always in grasping his nettle, and he at
once followed Romilly to his lair. That was not so grim a place
as you might have imagined, but rather a tumbledown cottage on
the edge of the country above the mill. Romilly was resting,
lying on a pile of straw and sacking when Johanson invaded him.
His great body stretched its full length, his tangled beard, his
small and puzzled eyes and, oddly enough, rather fine and
delicate hands, made a queer picture in the tumbled and
thick-smelling cottage.</p>

<p>He did not raise himself when he saw Johanson, but asked him
what he wanted.</p>

<p>"I want less of your company," Johanson said.</p>

<p>Romilly laughed, and then explained that he could bloody well
go where he bloody well pleased, and what the hell was a bloody
foreigner doing down in Seatown anyway.</p>

<p>Johanson explained that Seatown was free to all the world, to
himself and to others. He would come there when he pleased and,
he repeated, he would like less of Romilly's company.</p>

<p>Romilly slowly rose from his straw and, stretching his arms
and yawning, asked Johanson what he intended to do about it. The
two men stood facing one another. They were much of a size;
Romilly's open shirt showed a chest with black hair like a
bear's.</p>

<p>Romilly surveyed him curiously and still with that puzzled
look in his eye, animal and a little pathetic.</p>

<p>"Will you fight?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"Now?" asked Johanson.</p>

<p>"No. To-morrow night at the 'Sucking Pig.'"</p>

<p>"Yes. If you fight fair," Johanson answered after a moment's
thought. Romilly would fight fair. There was something in the
man's slow gaze that promised it.</p>

<p>"Now get out," said Romilly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Johanson woke at five the next day. He went to his window and
looked out at the lovely summer morning and the town as quiet as
a sleeping child. Layers of sun were stretched above it, awnings
of faintly washed colour, and the Cathedral towers were of bright
gold.</p>

<p>He bathed himself, dressed, and very softly went down the
stairs. He had a jack-knife and a little hammer and chisel. The
street shone in the sun with the freshness that Nature gives to
things before human beings have meddled with them. A little
breeze rollicked down the hill. There was no human being to be
seen.</p>

<p>He walked over to the seat and the tree. He knelt down on the
grass before the stone fountain and worked there with his hammer
and chisel for an hour or so. Then, as the first comers began to
pass down the street and the Cathedral bells chimed seven, he
returned to his room.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The "Sucking Pig" was an inn a mile out of the town on the
border of the desolate strip of moor known as Humpathumb (and of
that same place there is a story to be told one day). In 1907 it
was kept by an old blackguard called Coffen. It was burnt to the
ground in 1910.</p>

<p>On that fine summer night its central room was crowded.
Johanson, surveying it, felt a strange throb of satisfaction. At
last there was a hope that he would come to close grips with his
enemy. For weeks past everything had eluded him; he had been
fighting shadows. Now at last there was Bill Romilly's dark face
and hairy chest to batter at. He felt as though here at last was
his first opportunity to knock down a bit of Seatown. Everything
in his other life, even Maude, was distant and misty to him
to-night. He knew what the results of this thing must be in the
Upper Town. "A drunken brawl. Fighting in a low pub. Oh, quite
gone to pieces, my dear . . ." He cared not at all. To-night was
his first step on his real road.</p>

<p>As he looked about him he wondered what kind of a fighter he
would turn out to be. He hadn't been in a real fight since he was
a lad, but he was in splendid condition, which Romilly most
certainly was not.</p>

<p>It happened as it had been arranged. They were lounging about,
drinking. Romilly pushed Johanson's arm, muttered something;
Johanson replied, Romilly knocked his glass of beer out of his
hand. Instantly from all over the room there were cries of "A
Fight! A Fight!" The crowd scattered and then ranged itself back
against the bar and the three walls. A short, squat, broken-nosed
fellow touched Johanson on the arm: "I'll be behind yer," he
said. The centre of the floor was clear, and about it in the
strange mingled light of the summer evening that was fading into
ivory beyond the windows, and the harsh light of the jerking,
hissing gas, the faces pressed. Everything was irregular: here
eyes swollen and protruding, there a beaked nose, here strange
caps and shawls, there a whole face thrown up into sharp relief
like a dead upturned face in its motionless intensity, and behind
these a restless, ceaseless murmur and shuffling of bodies like
the lapping of sea on the rocks.</p>

<p>Two chairs were set in the empty space. The two men stripped
to the waist, buckling their trousers about them according to
time-honoured tradition. A long thin man with a face like a skull
stepped forward and announced that these two gentlemen having had
a difference of opinion they intended to settle it here and now
with their fists as gentlemen should. That Mr. Ben Hawser would
referee. This last was received with murmurs of approval.
Johanson noticed, as he sat there, that there was no louder
sound. It was more like a dream than reality. Seatown still
maintained its odd quality of being yet beyond touch. Those odd
sinister faces, the queer half light beyond the inner circle, the
dark background like the outskirts of an undiscovered wood, the
tall thin fanatical body thrown into bold relief near the window
of old Mother Harper, the witch, the pursuing murmur as though
persons unseen were always on the move behind him, this was all
in its outer aspect unreal, unlike any life that he knew, but in
his inner soul it was part of an intense reality; as a sinner may
feel, perhaps, when at length he comes to grips with that sin for
which all his life he had been searching.</p>

<p>They made a strange contrast as they stood up facing one
another; Johanson's body so white, without a hair on his chest,
Romilly covered with a thick black felt on his shoulders, arms,
breast. They were men much of a size, and Romilly had not so much
fat on him as you might have expected from a man who must be out
of condition. As they stood there Seatown obviously considered
that it had not for a long time had the opportunity of beholding
two mightier men. The faces dipped and bobbed, the hissing murmur
of the water dragging back over the sand rose and fell, and a
flood of orange spread fan-wise over the reed-misted,
water-logged moor beyond the open window.</p>

<p>There were to be no pauses, no breathers, no rounds. Simply
one man was to knock the other out of sight. Seatown sighed once
again its satisfaction. This was the way to deal with the
stranger within its gates.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawser murmured something and the fight began. It was at
once very plain that neither man was a trained fighter. Romilly
had fought most of his battles (and they had been many) in
liquor, but to-night he was serious sober. Both men were
cautious, circling round one another, their eyes intent, as
though wire stretched from face to face holding them.</p>

<p>Johanson hit out and lightly grazed Romilly's cheek. Romilly
breathed hard, gazed at Johanson with that same dumb look of
enquiry that was so especially his, then got one in on Johanson's
right breast, which flushed a dull red. Johanson returned and
caught Romilly hard on the left shoulder, breaking the skin.</p>

<p>Johanson was aware then that this man wanted to kill him, and
that every man and woman in that place wanted to kill him.</p>

<p>He had intruded; he had stirred up their nest and they would
get rid of him. But sure as he was of this, he was also sure that
to-night the fight would be fair. Seatown had some traditions,
this of fair fight on such an occasion was one. But on a later
occasion . . .</p>

<p>He felt arising in himself an eager burning longing to smash
Romilly's nose flat. He bore Romilly no kind of grudge, but his
big black lumbering body was a kind of insult. The thing was so
large and clumsy, and yet so elusive. Anger was rising in him,
not at all against Romilly, but against anything as ugly as
Romilly's body. There should not be in the world anything as ugly
as that, and it was Johanson's duty to break it up. But it was
strangely difficult to touch. Johanson knew that he must conserve
his strength, and that every unnecessary step that he took he
must pay for, but when he seemed to have that black heaving mass
at his mercy suddenly it wasn't there.</p>

<p>The circle of his horizon narrowed. He had at first seen the
whole room with the bar, the shining tumblers, the wall with the
old dirty coloured print, the pressed circle of faces, the open
window with the evening like a glass picture. Now it narrowed and
narrowed, first to the shining floor below him, to the queer ugly
face of his supporter, to the chairs opposite him; then that
closed in and he saw only Romilly, Romilly with his sweating
forehead, his black beard with beads of perspiration on it, his
heavy breasts and a roll of his fat hanging over his tightened
trousers. Then it narrowed again and he saw only a square of
flesh, first here, now there, something that he must get into
contact with.</p>

<p>He had not a great idea of self-defence. He knew that Romilly
had caught him first here then there. He dimly expected that at
some moment there would arrive a swinging blow that would pitch
him down into darkness, and this expectation gave him a sense of
urgency, as though he had not much time and must get his blow in
first.</p>

<p>He did get his blow in. Romilly's face seemed to leap at him,
and his own fist crashed out and met it. He felt the contact of
bone with bone. Romilly's face was red through the black, a flush
of blood that covered the whole sky, so that for an instant
Johanson could not see anything but that. Romilly lurched and
tottered, but then was as strong as ever again: in a moment he
was back and crashed as it were with his whole body into
Johanson's forehead.</p>

<p>The floor rose in a great curve, as though worked by an
engine, and stood over Johanson. Some voice somewhere said: "If
you don't hold on to this thread you'll fall into the very bowels
of the earth and never appear again. Your life depends on holding
this." A tiny white thread, its end tipped with silver, was held
out to him, and he held on to it with every force--moral,
spiritual, physical--that he possessed. The floor was still
hanging above him, and he, standing on the edge of it, almost
slipped into that eternity of blackness quivering with stars that
waited for him. But he did not slip, and when Romilly returned
with a hand extended that need give but the slightest push to
tumble him over he managed to evade that hand and, sick, blinded,
tottering, kept his feet. Slowly the world returned. He felt
about him an air of surprise that he should still be there. The
pain in his head was awful, but the rest of his body was strong
enough. Vigour was flowing back into him and, turning, he saw
Romilly quite clearly, blood trickling through his hair and the
big body shaking uncertainly.</p>

<p>That vision was his salvation. He saw Romilly only for an
instant before blood trickling from his forehead bruise blinded
him, but that instant was enough. With every atom of the vigour
of all his past and present life behind it, his arm shot out, his
fist crashed into Romilly just under the chin, and Romilly fell
and where he fell he lay and where he lay there he stayed,
stretched his length like a dead man.</p>

<p>Johanson stood staring. The murmur around him was still low
and ceaseless--like bees now buzzing in the bracken. Yes, he
stood and stared, not thinking of anything save that he had hit
Seatown at last. And Seatown also knew it. The faces did not
change, the bodies scarcely moved. The gas hissed and fretted,
there was no light now beyond the window and so still was it that
a stream in a field could be heard jumping down the hill,
hurrying to the Pol.</p>

<p>Johanson was sitting on his chair, a towel over his shoulders.
No one congratulated him, but his second bathed his forehead with
a sponge. Romilly had been dragged to a chair and men were
bending over him. But Johanson did not care about Romilly. He was
watching with a curious, almost somnolent, gaze the faces in the
room. They stared at him abstractedly, unmalevolently, but with a
definite purpose in their gaze.</p>

<p>They would let him alone to-night, but they would finish him
off later. Time enough. Time enough. He was almost asleep there
in his chair. How his forehead ached! What a headache he would
have to-morrow!</p>

<p>Then, slowly rising, he moved off. Quite silently they all
made way for him.</p>

<h1><a name="c209">CHAPTER IX</a></h1>

<h1>THE LAST LECTURE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>And here I must, I am afraid, bring myself into it. I have
reached the moment when I had my one and only glimpse of
Johanson. I was, myself, present at that famous last lecture.</p>

<p>I was at the end of my first year at Cambridge and had come to
stay for a week or two with some relations in Polchester. I had
been brought up in Polchester and every stone in it was familiar
to me: on my very first evening I heard of Johanson.</p>

<p>The way that his story came to me was, I think, instructive:
he was described to me, quite simply, as a foreign ruffian. I was
asked to imagine to myself a man who had come from some dangerous
place abroad with definitely sinister designs upon our
simple-hearted town. He had in the first place "wheedled" himself
into people's sympathies by a tale of ill-luck and hardship, he
had been boarded and cared for by one of the "kindest women in
the town" (my informant was at least correct there), had started
a gymnasium and interested some of the "foremost clergy" in his
efforts, had managed to engage himself to the daughter, "a most
beautiful girl," of his landlady and then--THEN--what had he not
done that was shameful and base? He had betrayed apparently every
one, leaving his fianc&eacute;e for the company of a most immoral
woman, had come out in his true colours advocating the pulling
down of most of the town, had insulted those of the clergy who
had been so good to him, had played some charlatan tricks with
the women of the place, pretending to cure their children of all
sorts of diseases, and had finally been fighting in some low pub
in the slums among a drunken crowd of the town's worst citizens.
And, after all this, he had actually the impertinence to announce
another lecture; notices were posted all over the town.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this was the first I had ever heard
of the man. I did not know of the existence of most of those who
were afterwards to give me all the full and elaborate information
upon which this history has been built--Judy, Mrs. Penethen, Miss
Midgeley, Maude herself, Ronder, Tom Longstaffe, Mary and the
rest. I knew nothing of life, of course. I saw him that evening
as the foreign ruffian described to me by my aunt.</p>

<p>This was exactly the fashion in which almost every one in our
town was at that moment seeing him. That last fight down in
Seatown had given the final touch to Legend No. III.--the legend
of the foreign ruffian.</p>

<p>I wonder myself that his new landlady when she saw him with
one eye closed and a bruise on his forehead bigger than a duck's
egg did not at once beg him to seek rooms elsewhere. But, she
afterwards confessed, "She had taken a sort of liking to him!"
She didn't know how. She didn't know why. There it was. She was
sort of sorry for him. And then, of course, all her attention was
given to her mother.</p>

<p>For himself I know that at this moment he was considering not
at all what the town was thinking about him. He was occupied, as
Tom Longstaffe discovered, with two things and two things only,
and these two things warred the one against the other.</p>

<p>One was his idea, which grew in him with ever-increasing
force, that somehow he <i>must</i> get rid of himself. If he
could do that and do it completely, then the most wonderful
discoveries awaited him. He would see and feel and be surrounded
by such beauty as he had never even begun to imagine.</p>

<p>I fancy that now his old dream of his empty house with its
shining purity, its view and its murmuring trees was always with
him. It was in some way <i>here</i> that his discovery would come
to him.</p>

<p>But on the other hand there was his other preoccupation, and
that was Maude. He thought of her morning, noon, and night. How
was he to rid himself <i>of</i> himself when he loved her so
much? It was he who loved her, he, Harmer John, he, Hjalmar
Johanson, he, not an abstraction, not a spirit, but he himself
with his bones and blood and beating heart!</p>

<p>It was not only that he wanted her so badly, but that he was
afraid that she was so unhappy. He was, himself, suffering so
terribly because of his separation from her that he could not but
believe that she was suffering too. I don't know, and no one will
ever know, how often at night he went and stood outside that
house and went quietly away again. Mrs. Penethen came to him when
she could. She promised to tell him instantly when there seemed a
chance. But the chance never came. I suppose that it was Maude's
fright that held her back. She saw him in an atmosphere of danger
and terror and distress and she wanted her safe little life of
comfort and assurance and that her own free will should do what
it pleased. What lover is there who has not sometimes, at the
very highest moment of his love, felt terror at the increasing
surrender of his own self-will? I imagine that Maude had never
seen Johanson as he really was, but had loved him for the very
strangeness that frightened her. She had perhaps--and who will
ever know?--many and many a moment during this time when she
longed to run and surrender everything to him. But she wanted her
own way, and there was something in him--some independence--that
she would never be able to conquer, and the stories in the town
grew and grew (you may be sure that they were all brought to her
ears) and people flattered her and encouraged her in her
selfishness, and she was very young and very ignorant--and so she
missed the chance of her life.</p>

<p>If she had, at this time, once been alone with him for an hour
he would, I think, have won her back again. But would it even
then have lasted? I fancy not. There were certain things to which
he must have held, and those things would have terrified and
antagonised her to the end.</p>

<p>Had he been a cleverer, more sophisticated, man many things
would have been different. But he was not, as everyone must have
seen by this time, a clever man at all.</p>

<p>The ideas that he was discovering for himself were not new.
They were as old as the oldest hills. Nor was he subtle-minded,
nor was he very quick at perceiving what others were thinking. He
could only see one or two things at a time, and those things that
he saw he clung to. So he went on his inevitable way, but before
he reached the climax of his last lecture a queer thing
occurred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the beginning of September he reopened his office. Nobody
came. He sat there day after day, sent out his circulars, did a
little correspondence with people in the country, and waited. All
his regular classes--the School, the tradesmen, the Young Men's
Christian Association--these had all lapsed. He put an
advertisement in the local Polchester paper, and one or two
people came to see him, but his enemies and detractors warned
them, I suppose, and they did not come again. Two of his most
active enemies at this time were old Miss Eldred and the
miserable Shortt. They went about everywhere loudly complaining.
To listen to them you would think that Johanson had robbed them
of every penny they possessed.</p>

<p>He was not, I imagine, at all surprised or disappointed that
he was thus abandoned. His mind was now fixed upon something
quite other than teaching physical exercises to Polchester
citizens. One thing, however, worried him, and that was old Billy
Trenant. That old man was a perfect nuisance. It would be
pleasant to draw a picture of the man's touching fidelity, the
faithful servant (another Caleb Balderstone) remaining when every
one else deserted his master. And he did remain. Let that at
least stand to his credit. He remained from some real dim sense
of loyalty--but he remained complaining, grumbling, abusing,
criticising. As with every true Glebeshire peasant there was a
note of patronage in his attitude to all other humans, be they
kings or paupers. He had patronised Johanson even at the height
of his admiration for him. Now he admired himself immensely for
remaining, and let Johanson know it. His Glebeshire pride must
have suffered a horrid blow when all that splendid erection
tumbled to the ground. Deep down he must have felt for his
master, and it would seem from his after account of his devotion
that he had always loved him and loved him to the last. But he
showed his love, like many another, in grumblings, complaints and
mutterings. He would not allow his son to come to the office any
longer, and indeed there was no work for the boy. There was no
work for the old man either, and, of course, no pay. He stayed
there in the outer room cursing.</p>

<p>The lecture was to be in a week's time. There was every kind
of rumour about it, and there was no doubt but that the place
would be full. Johanson had taken this time a big room at the
back of the Public Library, often used for local "Penny
Readings," Missionary meetings and so on. This time there would
be no chairman.</p>

<p>Then the surprising thing occurred. Johanson had a visitor,
and the visitor was Canon Ronder.</p>

<p>I have received two accounts of this interview, one from
Ronder himself and one that Johanson gave to Longstaffe. It seems
that Ronder, on this occasion, obeyed one of the sincerest and
truest instincts of his life. For once he did not stop to
consider whether this were a wise step or one calculated to help
his schemes. He came simply because in his heart he was fond of
the man and thought that he was rushing to his destruction. He
may have had, too, some guilty sense that he was responsible for
him, he may have felt a deep discomfort about Seatown, and, most
probable of all, he may have had some startling vision of the
rapidity with which he himself was changing. On that morning at
least it was not only Johanson's descent of which he was
aware.</p>

<p>Johanson was greatly surprised to see him. He had for the
moment quite forgotten Ronder's existence. He was pleased to see
him, though. He never at that time or any other bore the
slightest grudge against any human being. Hogg he hated, but
impersonally, as he hated disease, meanness, and
evil-speaking.</p>

<p>His forehead was still bruised, his eye yet discoloured, but
he showed no embarrassment when Ronder came in, greeted him as
warmly as he had ever done. Their relations were, however, now
altered. They were equals, and that sense of power and command
that Ronder had felt at the last meeting was now increased.</p>

<p>"I have come," Ronder said, "to ask whether you would care for
me to be chairman again at your approaching lecture."</p>

<p>It was a fine thing for Ronder to do, and Johanson knew at
once that it was so. Johanson saw by that time clearly enough
into Ronder's character; he knew how much his social prestige
meant to him, how he had worked unceasingly for many years to
obtain his present command in the town, how deeply precious to
him was his power over his fellow human beings.</p>

<p>"That's good of you," he said, smiling into Ronder's face. "It
shan't be like the last lecture, you know."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Ronder said hurriedly. "I don't ask you
anything about it. It's better perhaps that I shouldn't know what
you mean to say. But I'm delighted to take the chair if you wish
me."</p>

<p>"There's likely to be a row, you know," Johanson went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ronder. "There may be."</p>

<p>"I'm not a popular man any longer."</p>

<p>"Not so popular as you were," said Ronder.</p>

<p>"I don't hope," said Johanson, still smiling, "that I should
be as mean as to drag you into one of my rows."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Ronder repeated firmly. "If you want me
I'm at your service."</p>

<p>"That's fine," Johanson said, his eyes smiling. "I shall never
forget that you offered. I thank you. But this time I shall be
alone."</p>

<p>Ronder said: "You'd better have some one with you, you know.
After all it may help matters." He got up from his chair,
hesitated, then went on: "I don't understand you. You're like no
man I've ever met before. You seem to <i>want</i> to make
trouble, and yet, knowing you, I would have said you were one who
wanted to live at peace with his fellow-men."</p>

<p>"I do want to live at peace with them," said Johanson.</p>

<p>"Well, then--"</p>

<p>"But not if, to do so, I must be dishonest."</p>

<p>"We've had all this out before," Ronder said rather quickly.
"I know you've got some idea in your head that won't let you
rest, but couldn't you have given that idea a better chance if
you'd gone on as you were going at first, if you'd established
yourself and won all men's regard--wouldn't they then have
listened to you more readily?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Johanson simply. "I had to think as I
thought, and then say what I thought. Men are finer than I and
cleverer and know the world, but I don't understand. No, I don't
understand two things. Men don't seem to care about Life, nor
they don't seem to care about Beauty."</p>

<p>"About Life?" Ronder asked.</p>

<p>"What Life's for. What Life means. They are always asking to
be happy, but they don't care about Beauty. How can any man be
happy when he doesn't care for Beauty?" Then he put his hand on
Ronder's sleek, rounded shoulder. "Don't you worry yourself about
me, see? I find my own way. I must, but I'm pretty glad you came
to me as you did. I think that was fine."</p>

<p>Ronder's heart, in spite of the fatty degeneration of the last
years, was filled with alarm and distress about the perils into
which this poor, foreign devil was so blindly rushing. He had
heard, I suppose, a good deal during these last weeks; he knew
something of the Seatown gentry, of Hogg and his friends. His
concern was the most genuine human feeling that he had known for
many a day. Johanson offered more than one man a chance at that
time.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he began, pacing the little room in his
agitation, "that it serves no purpose at all to raise such
hostility? Upon my word, I don't know how you've done it. The
things I hear are absurd, of course. But Seatown--" He stopped at
the name, having his own none too comfortable thoughts in that
connection.</p>

<p>"Was it wise," he went on more quietly, "to interfere there
about matters in which you could not possibly have any real
concern?"</p>

<p>"Concern!" Johanson broke in. "Concern! Do you know, Canon
Ronder, what that place is? But you can't know. Come down with me
any afternoon and I shall show you--like beasts . . . like beasts
. . ." His voice broke. "In my own country," he went on more
quietly, "there are horrible places--in Copenhagen and
Christiania too. But these are big industrial towns; there is
problems that belongs to our time, difficult, gigantic problems I
know nothing of. But here in this little town, so small, so
beautiful, that there should be such a place! One day's work
would take it all away. Can't you see that? Can you have your
breakfast and your dinner in quiet when at your door there are
the four families in one room, men, women and children sleeping
in one bed, humans like pigs, sorrow and hunger and cruelty . . .
and no one cares? Oh! you English, what is it with you? You are
so moral and you look unblushing on such immorality, you are so
kind and you watch patiently such cruelty, you are so religious
and you listen without caring to such blasphemy, you are so wise
with all you have learnt from your old civilisation and you
permit such stupidity. . . ." He came up to Ronder, took him by
the shoulders, shook him. "I don't understand. Why do not men
care more to make the world beautiful for others? How <i>can</i>
they be so indifferent?"</p>

<p>"It's true what I prophesied," Ronder said. "I said the time
would come when you would want to change men. It <i>has</i> come.
You're just like all the others."</p>

<p>"Yes, it <i>has</i> come," Johanson cried, "I <i>can't</i> be
quiet. I can't. And if there are so many others, where are they?
because I would join them and work with them. Two or three of
us--what we could do! I'm so alone in this. No one cares. Every
one goes on as if everything was all right. And I'm not clever. I
don't know anything. I've never learnt anything. . . ."</p>

<p>Then he laughed, looking a boy again as he used to look. "Of
all men the worst is the one who would teach others when he don't
know anything himself. I'm just such a one."</p>

<p>That was true. Ronder felt it. Of all the types of man
presented to him the one that he hated most was the noble
Propagandist, the He-Man, the Splendid Saviour of Men who dealt
in vague words and, thumping his tub, gathered in the shekels of
the sentimentalist. Johanson, by all the rules, was becoming such
a one. But his ignorance saved him--his ignorance and his
honesty. Ronder was sentimental when his brain allowed him to be.
He was sentimental now. He felt as though Johanson were a small
son of his who was going to a boarding-school for the first time.
He always liked children if they were not impertinent to him.</p>

<p>He renewed his offer of taking the chair. Johanson refused it.
Then Ronder, ashamed of himself both because he had done so much
and had not done more, hurried away.</p>

<p>Johanson sat on alone in his little room, forgetting Ronder,
forgetting the lecture, forgetting Seatown; longing, longing,
longing for Maude.</p>

<p>These empty hours without work were not good for his strength
of control.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Every one knows how swiftly in a small provincial town alarm
can raise its head. I remember when I was a small boy in
Polchester that a housemaid had her throat cut, and the story
rose that Jack the Ripper, weary of London as a background for
his crimes, had chosen our little town for a week or two. There
was no basis for this tale, but every night for weeks young men
went out after dusk with sticks to search for the monster. All
the kitchen-maids of Polchester cowered beside their kitchen
fires, and all the teeth of all the old women chattered. . .
.</p>

<p>So it was now with Harmer John. In the days that preceded the
lecture there was no story about him too fantastic to be
believed. He was the emissary of a secret society, a hireling of
a foreign nation sent with dynamite in his pocket to blow up the
Cathedral; he had been seen o' nights talking at street corners
with sinister characters; some early riser had seen him creep out
of his house at four in the morning, look up and down the street,
then cross over to a tree and hide himself there; men and women
recalled how in those earlier days of his popularity he had
wormed himself into their secrets and extracted their
confidences. He was a leading member of a secret society of Jews
and his real name was Moses Aaronson. And so on, and so on. . .
.</p>

<p>Myself, being at that undergraduate stage of my education when
nothing was holy to me, and cynicism my only wear, of course
discarded all these stories and laughed openly at my aunt, who
was one of the principal purveyors of them. My aunt, a gaunt and
bony woman, as superstitious as she was kind-hearted, declared to
me: "Why, one of his principal friends, they say, is the chief
lunatic of the town, an old man who has been crazy ever since I
can remember!" This seemed to me a real argument in favour of his
innocence, but to herself it was final proof of his
wickedness.</p>

<p>I was interested; there was not much in the Polchester of
those days to amuse an idle undergraduate. I looked about me
trying to see the fellow. I even went down to Seatown, his
favourite haunt, I was told.</p>

<p>But the nearest I got to him was old Looney, whom I discovered
watching the tide in the market-place.</p>

<p>I looked at the old man but did not speak to him. I felt a
kind of shyness.</p>

<p>There was some talk that the police intended to prohibit the
lecture, but that, I imagine, would not at all have suited the
plans of Hogg and the rest.</p>

<p>Excitement about it was intense. Every kind of catastrophe was
expected. My aunt implored me not to go. I would not have missed
it for all the aunts in Christendom. When the evening arrived I
found a companion in young Jeremy Cole, older than myself by two
years and just finished with Oxford. He was a good, stout fellow,
with no nonsense about him. He had spent only a little of this
vacation in Polchester, but had picked up quite another version
of the story. He knew Longstaffe. Longstaffe had told him that
this was a man in a million. But I was sceptical. "One of these
Hyde Park orators," I said. "I know them!"</p>

<p>Cole was not a man of many words. "There's no nonsense about
Longstaffe," he said. "If he likes a fellow there's something in
it."</p>

<p>We set off for the Library together. Our tickets were for
reserved seats, but we congratulated ourselves on being twenty
minutes before time when we saw the mob that pressed about the
Library door. It was evident at a glance that we were going to
enjoy a disturbed evening. There were men and boys hanging about
there who had certainly come for no other purpose than to make a
row.</p>

<p>There were actually three whole live Polchester policemen at
the door. Three, and in the same place at the same time. I had
not seen so many Polchester police since the '97 Jubilee.</p>

<p>The crowd was at present good-natured. We had not very great
trouble in passing through the doors (Cole is a thick-set, stocky
fellow, as an Oxford Rugby half needs to be), and then we
streamed up the stone staircase with all the Polcastrians. I
noticed at once that the crowd was not very respectable, many
more men than women, and men of the kind who shout to one another
as they go and whistle loudly through sheer vacancy of spirits.
It was the kind of crowd you may see any day at a League football
match.</p>

<p>I had heard that his first lecture had been honoured by the
presence of the Cathedral "Quality." Perhaps to-night they would
come in later, because their seats would be reserved, but it was,
I think, as I felt these men jostling past me up the stairs that
I was conscious of my first twinge of sympathy towards this man
Johanson. I felt in the air about me that "crowd" savagery that
springs often from nowhere at all, something for which no
individual is responsible, but to whose power every individual
yields.</p>

<p>Cole felt the same. "There's not going to be much lecture, I
fancy," I heard him mutter as we were pushed forward.</p>

<p>However, when we passed the doors into the hall we found
everything quiet and decorous enough. The hall was nearly filled.
Our seats were towards the back under a narrow overhanging
balcony and not far from the door, as I noticed to my relief. If
there was a bad row we might want to get away quickly.</p>

<p>Nothing could look more proper. It was one of those
commonplace, square, flat-faced rooms with white distempered
walls, bad paintings of certain plain and elderly gentlemen,
round white gas globes and an empty stage with two chairs, a
small table, and a jug of water.</p>

<p>As we seated ourselves I wondered whether there would be room
for everybody. The place was already three-quarters filled, and
still they were pouring in. We were all pushed very closely
together, and Jeremy Cole had to put his arm around the back of
my chair to hold on securely.</p>

<p>As the hands of the smug-faced clock turned towards eight
o'clock the room seemed to be absolutely packed, and there was a
thick gathering of men and boys around the door. Two mild and
elderly men who were showing people into their places went
constantly to the door and called out that there was no more room
inside, but still people pressed forward, and there was a great
deal of protesting and noise and laughter.</p>

<p>I saw, as I looked about me, that the impression that I had
had coming up the stairs was a true one; not only were the "Upper
Ten" not present, the better townspeople were not there either.
It was in truth a pretty ruffianly gathering. The majority of
those in the room had certainly not paid for their tickets;
whether some one else had paid for them was another question.</p>

<p>I remember that as I looked about me two faces detached
themselves from the crowd, one familiar and one not. The familiar
one was that of Samuel Hogg, and indeed he was standing quite
close to me, leaning against one of the grey mottled pillars of
the balcony. I fancy that I got the impression as I looked at his
fat body and flushed red face that he surveyed the scene as
though it were all his handiwork--an air of pride, that is, and
self-congratulation. He was smiling pleasantly, and looked most
amiable. But he was very quiet, apparently rather far away in his
thoughts and not wishing to disturb anybody. He was dressed in a
very decent suit of dark blue.</p>

<p>The other face--unfamiliar--was that of a girl. She was
sitting some way up the room on the outside of her row, and
leaning outwards as though she wished every one to see her. She
did not, however, give the impression of showing off but rather
of defiance. She was dark and slight, plainly dressed, not pretty
but noticeable because of the challenging, fierce, hostile way
she looked about her, as though she were saying: "You thought I
wouldn't come, but here I am and I don't care who knows it."</p>

<p>One other thing. Just after eight o'clock had struck I heard
some one--a man--behind me say: "His girl--you know, Maude
Penethen--just gone and fixed herself with young Boultewood.
That'll make him pretty mad. Wonder if he knows it."</p>

<p>His companion said something and he answered: "Can't imagine.
He's a rotter, that young Boultewood. Always was and always will
be."</p>

<p>Soon after the strokes of the clock had died away a door at
the back of the stage opened and Johanson came in. There was a
demonstration as soon as he appeared, but not a very violent one,
some clapping, some booing and hissing. He seemed to pay no
attention to that, but came forward quietly to the front of the
platform and stood there waiting until it had ceased.</p>

<p>He was a fine man to look at, finer than I had expected. With
his breadth and height he had also a magnificent carriage that
would have made him noticeable anywhere. But the thing that
struck me most strongly was his perfect control. Men give away a
great deal of their real personality in that first moment of
their appearance on the platform, and you could not doubt when
you looked at this man but that there was something very honest
and noble about him. At least so it seemed to me.</p>

<p>Then his face was agreeable, simple, direct and, what I had
not expected, rather humorous. A boy's sense of fun perhaps,
although to-night there was something in his gaze as he looked
out over the room indignant and surprised. He stood very well,
his hands quietly at his side. He was dressed in a dark suit and
wore a black tie.</p>

<p>The demonstration had quickly died down and, as a newspaper
man would have written, you could hear a pin drop.</p>

<p>I liked his voice too when he began to speak. There was a
marked foreign accent and he used certain words, noticeably
prepositions and adverbs, wrongly, but he spoke remarkable
English for a foreigner who had been in our country for so short
a time, and his voice was strong and carried admirably. I liked
the simple way he spoke, without any ostentation and as though he
had forgotten himself entirely.</p>

<p>I was prejudiced then at once in the man's favour, but when it
came to the things that he said, that was quite another
matter.</p>

<p>You must remember that I was at that stage in my young life
when I was entirely disillusioned, and thought that I knew
everything. Because I was deeply sentimental at heart I was
terrified of any point of view that could, even faintly, be
called sentimental. In religion I had flung "the Churches" behind
me, and if pressed would perhaps have confessed to some very
superior sort of Buddhism. I had picked up at Cambridge a jargon
of old-world weariness. There were beginning to be heard very
faintly at that time the whisperings of the creed that those two
clever gentlemen Freud and Jung were afterwards to make so
popular--namely, that nothing was anybody's fault, that you were
what you were. Also the first signs of that universal pessimism
and realism that the war made so inevitable. I was a young
jackass, and entirely pleased with myself.</p>

<p>Jeremy Cole was otherwise, having given most of his attention
while at Oxford to football and birds. I liked him, but wished
him cleverer. When he astonished us all later I couldn't
understand it--but I understand it now.</p>

<p>After three minutes my condescending pity for Johanson knew no
bounds. It was exactly as though a child of six were expounding
life to us; at the end of a quarter of an hour I was surprised to
find myself still listening, and I decided that it must be the
man's obvious sincerity that held me. At the end of half an hour
(when the crash came) I was on the man's side, let him talk what
nonsense he pleased.</p>

<p>He had begun, diffidently and with rather a charming shyness,
by saying that this lecture was a sequel to one that he had given
some while before. In that other he had spoken entirely about
care of the body, and had shown them some simple means by which
the body could be kept strong and healthy. But that, as he had
told them then, was only the beginning of living rightly. He must
apologise when he was himself ignorant and inexperienced for
making statements that probably to many in the room had been
obvious long ago. But he thought that it was always interesting
if one man should tell, honestly, to others the things that he
had found to be true. He was not trying to force his ideas upon
any one, but there might be some who thought as he did, and, if
there were, he would be glad to meet them.</p>

<p>He explained then how all his life he had been concerned with
physical culture, but that it was only after he came to this town
that he discovered that this physical culture was unimportant
compared to the other things that it led to.</p>

<p>He had, like other men, often wondered about life, what it
meant, what it led to, why human beings were alive at all. The
religions that he had encountered had not satisfied him, and he
was perpetually dissatisfied with himself because he was so
selfish, and only cared for the things that brought himself
happiness.</p>

<p>Then he made his first discovery--that this pursuit of selfish
happiness was no good, no practical as well as no moral good.
Why, one day he asked himself, was he always so preoccupied about
making himself happy and so intent upon himself that he was
missing all the time the beauty that was on every side of him? If
he thought more of the beauty that was outside himself then he
would think less of the dissatisfaction in himself. He then
gradually saw that this beauty went farther than the beauty of
material physical things. It was fine to have a beautiful body,
to have it in splendid trim, to feel healthy and strong. That was
the first duty of beauty, to keep your body fit. Beyond that was
the beauty of all outside things--the beauty of Nature, the
beauty of pictures and of music, the beauty of furniture and of
houses and of streets. That was the second duty of beauty. But
beyond and extending these was the third beauty--the beauty of
conduct, of unselfishness, loving-kindness, fidelity and
courtesy. And this third world of beauty led to God.</p>

<p>He found then that all the trouble in the world came from two
things, from selfishness and fear, and that as soon as one became
interested in something, however small, outside oneself, one
became less anxious for one's own safety, less eager to challenge
others. There might come a time, he thought, when we would be,
all of us, so busy with the creation of beauty, whether of
beautiful things or of beautiful deeds, that our concern for our
own safety would be forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>Our health, our daily bread, these things would be found to be
much more simply obtained when we were not always concerned about
them. The conduct of life rested, it might be, on certain very
simple things like fidelity to our word and thoughtfulness for
others. If we made only one beautiful thing, not for ourselves,
but because we would pay our debt to beauty, we had done
something with our lives.</p>

<p>So far he had gone, and you may imagine what I felt. The
triteness, the sentimentality, the cheapness of it! How many
millions of times had the world not been greeted with little
books, little orations, little sermons proclaiming just such a
creed! How many good and stupid women, how many humbugging
charlatans, how many idiotic cranks, how many sentimental priests
and pastors, had not, in the history of this old, grey,
disillusioned world, proclaimed just such platitudes! I looked
around me expecting to find in others the exasperation that I was
feeling in myself. I did not find it. They were listening. The
row that Cole and I had confidently expected was not yet upon us.
There they all were, staring in front of them, with wide-open
eyes, cow-like, complacent. I had the sense that they were not
listening very much but were rather, in some way, mesmerised.
Mesmerised by the voice, perhaps, or by the quiet attitude of the
man.</p>

<p>This led me to consider more closely the speaker. I had to
confess to myself that I liked him. He might be talking
sentimental nonsense, but at least he was in utter earnest,
speaking only because these things seemed to him to be the most
important in the world, and they would not let him be quiet. I
listened to him with less intolerance, expecting no longer to
hear anything but tiresome platitude, but expecting to find in
the man himself a personality that was, far more than I had
supposed, worthy of my august attention.</p>

<p>He went on to say that he knew that one answer that would be
made to him was that he knew nothing about the social conditions
of modern life, that it was very easy to talk about beauty, but
that when you had no money and a family to provide for there was
not a great deal of time left in which to think about extras.
That when you were hungry or saw those you loved hungry, you
thought about your stomach, not about beauty. To that he answered
that there were very many, even in this little town of
Polchester, whose conditions were easy enough to allow them to
create beauty in the lives of those who were less fortunate. The
creation of beauty could go on in any place. Something was for
ever being created every moment of the day. Creation was always
at work, and if it was not beauty that was being created then it
was ugliness. Every word of slander or unkindness about another
was creating more ugliness, every hypocritical condemnation of
some one for a fault when we were in our own private lives, as we
all well knew, so guilty, was an act of ugliness.</p>

<p>Every insanitary room, every house insecure to the wind and
rain that we allowed to stand, was a work of ugliness.</p>

<p>He had come to Polchester, loving it at his first sight of it,
feeling that here was his home. What had he found here?</p>

<p>He paused. A stir, like a little wind, ran through the room.
What had he found? He had found hypocrisy, evil-speaking,
slander, malice, and the worst slum in Europe.</p>

<p>I caught my breath at that. I knew that the moment had
arrived. I looked again hurriedly about me and I saw still, in
most faces, that same staring gaze as of a crowd mesmerised.</p>

<p>But a voice, detached, like a stone flung through the ceiling,
cracked the silence.</p>

<p>"Yah! You and yer beauty. What about yer mistress up to St.
Paul's?"</p>

<p>The silence, although cracked, held. Johanson's voice came
back clearly and without a falter:</p>

<p>"My love for this town--"</p>

<p>They were the last words we heard. Chaos was upon us. Look
back as earnestly as I may it is chaos that I see. I can remember
that shouting and screaming of voices, fragmentary sentences: "Go
back to your own bloody country! We don't want you. Oo are you
preaching at? Oo crawled in at the Rec'try winder? Oo kissed two
girls at once? What about yer own dirty be'aviour?" And this
rhyme:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harmer John! Harmer John!<br>
 Went to bed with his trousies on;<br>
 Kissed the girls and made 'em cry;<br>
 Maudie, Mary, pudding and pie!</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>But it was not possible to hear anything distinctly. The more
respectable part of the audience, seeing that riot was truly upon
them at last, fled for the doors. The less respectable, in a
shouting, bellowing mob, pushed for the platform.
Things--vegetables, rotten eggs, bad fish--were hurtling through
the air; men and boys were scrambling down from the balcony,
sliding the pillars.</p>

<p>Cole caught my arm.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "They'll do him in if some one doesn't
stop them."</p>

<p>I looked across the room and saw that he was standing quietly
and without any alarm on the middle of the platform. Men,
shouting and waving their arms, were scrambling up towards him.
As, tumbling over chairs, we reached the front of the hall some
heavy fellow made a lurch at him. He moved back, still without
any sign of alarm, towards the wall, and as Cole and I clambered
on to the stage, we saw him struggling there, several men and
boys striking at him and dragging at his knees.</p>

<p>I forget then exactly what occurred. We rushed forward, and
soon there was a glorious m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Cole was no mild
antagonist, and I think that the mob very soon retreated. But I
know that my dominant impression was of Johanson, his collar and
shirt torn open, being extremely quiet and doing little more than
keep his assailants back. I had the notion that with one thrust
of his arm he could have scattered them all to the Hebrides.</p>

<p>In any case, in another moment we found ourselves, the three
of us, tumbling towards the door at the back of the stage and
then, surprisingly, alone, breathless, in the cool current of air
that a dark passage provided.</p>

<p>We could not see very clearly, but I fancied that he smiled
and said:</p>

<p>"Thank you. I don't hope you're damaged at all."</p>

<p>He shook our hands, I think. Then, very quietly, was gone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>

<h1>ALONE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Bond was out early one morning. Awaking pleasantly after
the healthiest of sleeps, she had seen, as it were in a vision,
that the sleeves of the new dress would never do. They would
<i>never</i> do. And how could it be that she had <i>not</i> seen
that last night. She had considered the sleeves while undressing
and they had seemed to her exactly the thing. And now this
morning . . . Miss Nightingale, the little dressmaker just below
St. Paul's Church, was both cheap and obliging, so obliging,
indeed, that she encouraged Mrs. Bond to bully her, and
positively enjoyed being trampled upon.</p>

<p>Cheap and obliging, yes, but so hardworking that before you
knew where you were those sleeves would be finished, and then
what a business of altering and altering. Sleeves were important
in 1907.</p>

<p>So there was nothing for it but to hurry through breakfast and
go down and stop her. So tiresome, but it was Mrs. Bond's duty to
Polchester that she should be properly dressed, and for her duty
she would do anything.</p>

<p>It was a lovely September morning and Mrs. Bond, having
enjoyed a pleasant chatty time during the last week or two and
having most amiably been as kind as possible to half a dozen
reputations, was in excellent spirits. The sun shone upon
everything, and Mrs. Bond could not help but think that she was
rather like the sun beaming upon Polchester with the rays of her
happiness and talent, and what Polchester would do without her
Mrs. Bond, modest though she was, found it impossible to imagine.
Miss Nightingale also found it impossible to imagine, and said
so, which was noble of her, considering how little Mrs. Bond paid
her, and how much work she demanded of her.</p>

<p>She scolded her now about the sleeves, and explained to her
that she would never to be able to retain the custom of the best
people in Polchester unless she kept her eyes open, and Miss
Nightingale, although this alteration in the sleeves was
precisely the one that a week ago she had recommended, entirely
agreed with her.</p>

<p>After this had been most satisfactorily settled, and Miss
Nightingale, who had sat up all night to finish a dress in time,
had sighed and smiled and sighed, and then sat down to the
sleeves, Mrs. Bond greeted, as one sovereign another, the sun
again.</p>

<p>Slowly she took her way up the hill. One did not hurry on so
lovely a morning. It was then that she saw a strange sight.
Positively shining in the sun was a seat, and this seat was newly
painted a dazzling white. So new was the paint that tied to the
corner of the seat was a notice "WET PAINT" written in a large
and sprawling hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bond had never noticed this seat before (and, indeed, she
was not often in this low part of the town). Nor would she have
noticed it now had it not been for the sun. From no spirit of
vulgar curiosity, but rather because she was in a way
Polchester's guardian and must be aware of everything, she
crossed the street and examined the seat. Then she saw something
truly astonishing!</p>

<p>Behind the seat and under the shadow of a spreading tree was a
little fountain, the prettiest little fountain ever!</p>

<p>Surely it was new. Mrs. Bond had never seen it before, she had
never before noticed this corner with its charming view over the
lower town, the river and the fields. Avoiding very carefully the
fresh paint, she bent forward. Here was a beautiful thing! With
her continental taste she could most truly appreciate it. A
little improper, perhaps (the Satyr wore no fig leaf) but here
too her continental taste helped her. The delicate symmetry of
its gentle curves, the running groups of figures (gods and
goddesses, Bacchus and his crew, Paris and the apple, what were
they?), the carving of vine leaves and fruits and flowers, how
delicious and classical! And how nobly it stood, raising its
central figure so daintily and with such dignity! Then, peering
more closely, she saw a date. 1735. 1735! All those years and she
had never seen it until now. Nor any one else. No one had ever
spoken about it.</p>

<p>She stayed for a moment, losing, for the briefest instant, her
consciousness of herself, Louisa Bond, her consciousness of her
position, her wit and talent, her kindliness and good-humour.</p>

<p>With a little breath of a sigh she moved away. Here was
something for her to speak about! She was the first, positively
the first! And with that up swept her consciousness again. She
was her normal self, thank God, once more.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On that same morning Johanson spent half an hour with Reuben
Fletch in his office. Very quiet there. Very friendly and very
cold.</p>

<p>Johanson was there in that neat, stern and unaccommodating
room exactly half an hour. He was very uncomfortable. He always
hated to ask for anything, and especially did he hate to ask
Fletch for anything.</p>

<p>And yet he must. He must ask whether the payment of the next
instalment for the new rooms might be postponed for a little. Or
possibly they might be let to some one else. The business that he
was doing just at this moment did not quite justify him . . .</p>

<p>How he hated it! And yet Fletch was, as he had always been to
him, very kind, speaking in his low voice, smiling often,
conveying no hint that he had ever heard that Johanson was a
failure, or was conscious at all of the terrible scandal of the
recent lecture.</p>

<p>But no one in Polchester was able to make Johanson feel so
absolutely that he was both a foreigner and a fool. He was both
these things--he knew it well. But he did not want Fletch to tell
him.</p>

<p>Fletch, smiling a little sadly, shook his head.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Johanson" (he was one of the people in
Polchester who knew Johanson's name exactly), "those rooms are an
awkward size. A little difficult. And, of course, you are liable.
No getting away from that, I am afraid. I fancied that you were a
little precipitate, but I didn't like to say anything. It was not
my place. We all make mistakes, of course."</p>

<p>Silence followed. Fletch never said anything when there was
nothing to say. Johanson stood in the middle of the room without
moving. Yes, he was a fool. He saw it in Fletch's eyes, and he
saw it also in the eyes of the young clerk who entered at that
moment.</p>

<p>"Well, you shall let me know if anything--"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'll let you know, Mr. Johanson."</p>

<p>"Good-day."</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Johanson."</p>

<p>Later it was a wet afternoon, wet with a thin driving rain.
Autumn had come in and you knew that in the woods the trees were
shaking their heads and shivering, aware that they were soon to
lose their leaves. The lamps were blurred and people were not
visible, only umbrellas.</p>

<p>As he entered his room, closing his door behind him, he was
aware, as though it were personified for him by the actual
presence of a dark and silent stranger, that the worst and most
terrible hour of his life was with him.</p>

<p>He had known few bad hours although things had often not gone
well with him, and it was because of this, perhaps, that he had
kept until now so much of the boy's temperament. But on this dark
and shivery afternoon in this desolate room he was a boy no
longer.</p>

<p>There are states of the soul--dark, lonely, suspicious
states--that no boy can know. Johanson was aware that such a
state stood now behind his chair. He sat down at the table, took
some papers that had to do with his business, set them before him
and tried to study them. He knew that he must once again close
his office and this time perhaps permanently, but that did not
touch him. He knew that beyond the rain-starred window the little
fountain was standing, but that did not touch him. He knew that
below the fountain was Seatown, miserable enough on this wet
evening, the place that had of late become with him an obsession,
but that did not touch him.</p>

<p>He saw none of these things. He saw only himself facing him at
the other end of the table. He saw himself as a fool and as a
failure, a complete and total failure.</p>

<p>He was not as a rule a man who thought about himself, and all
the events of the last months had been driving him towards one
end and one end only, that he should forget himself altogether
and lose himself in other greater things.</p>

<p>But now he saw only himself, himself Hjalmar Johanson, the
fool, the foreigner, the failure.</p>

<p>This was the first thing that hurt him, that he felt himself
now a foreigner in this little town that had seemed only a few
short months ago to be his true home. He had loved it from the
moment that he had entered it, and it had seemed at once to
respond to his love. It had something so beautiful, so touching
and so personal about it that it had appeared to him as though it
must have been meant for him. Now it had abruptly been taken away
from him. It was not only because the people here who had before
been so friendly were now so hostile. He had known, on that day
when he had visited Wistons, that the choice that he had made
then would estrange them from him. The scandal of the last
lecture had not distressed him; he had felt after it triumph
because he had been honest with himself and had tried to say what
he thought was true.</p>

<p>No, it was the town itself that had withdrawn: the streets
were foreign now, the houses frowned on him, and the stones of
the market-place were hard to his feet. What right had he, the
town might say, to come here, a foreigner, and patronise it with
his notions, his ignorant childish notions.</p>

<p>He told Longstaffe afterwards that he fancied that the rain as
it lashed the window was carrying the message of the town's scorn
and dislike to his ears.</p>

<p>Then, behind the town, he saw Maude. Now he lowered his head
and groaned aloud. He could see how foolish, yes, and how
ignorant and how selfish he had been. He had talked to her so
much of liberty and that they must both be free. But what freedom
had he allowed her? Had he not resented every friendship that she
had made? Had he not driven her into the arms of the Boultewoods
and Hogg and the rest? Could he not have found some way easier
for her than his insistence on her obedience and acquiescence in
his ideas? When they had been engaged for only a few weeks he had
begun to tell her what she must do and what she must not do. Was
that his sense of liberty? And his selfishness! He had thought of
her, yes, but only that she might be with him and that he might
see her and hear her laugh and watch her smile!</p>

<p>Just before entering the hall on the night of his lecture some
man near the door (he had not seen his face) had come up to him
and whispered: "Your Miss Penethen's engaged to young
Boultewood." All through the evening those words had whispered
and whispered. Young Boultewood! A miserable ne'er-do-well with
whom she could never be happy.</p>

<p>Stung with this thought, he paced his room, walking fast, his
head down. Oh! he must persuade her! He must show her! He must do
something!</p>

<p>He sat down again and quickly wrote to her. (This letter was
found afterwards in the drawer of this same table.)</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MAUDE--You shal not want to here of me but I beg you
becaus we was friends before and hav butiful memorys to read this
littel letter. I am not spelling this very wel becaus I am
writing it fas becaus of my feelings but I do beg you just to
read it and think of what I say.</p>

<p>I hav been told that you hav engaged yourself to mary young
Mr. Boultewood and I think that perhaps you hav done this becaus
you are angry with me and not becaus you luv him. Dear Maude I
don't hope you shal do this when you don't luv him truely. Place
me right out of youre mind and don't say I shal do this becaus I
hate anuther man but only do it if you luv him. Perhaps I am
wrong and you do luv him then Maude I have no rite to say a word
but if it is becaus you hate me don't do it Maude don't do it.

<p align="RIGHT">HJALMAR JOHANSON.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>But when he had finished this letter he felt in a greater
despair than before. What influence could he have over her now?
What influence could he hope to have? He had no right, and when
she read this letter she would only be angry and more obstinate
than before in her purpose.</p>

<p>He had lost her, but he thought that he could bear that, if he
had not also the belief that he had ruined her.</p>

<p>And for what? For the prosecution of some vague, empty ideal
that would be childish to any other man than he. Why could he not
have waited quietly in the town, doing his honest work, winning
the approval of all good men, minding his own affairs? Why must
he resent so intensely that Ronder and others, men older than he,
and wise in the ways of this country, should show him what he
should do, and should order his steps a little? Was it not the
last arrogance for him to resent their advice and think that he
knew better than they? His evening with Wistons, that had seemed
to him at the time to involve a genuine struggle of the soul,
now, in retrospect, appeared to be only the struggle of his
self-will and conceit for liberty.</p>

<p>His continual assertion of his friendship for the Longstaffes
appeared to him now a mockery. What had come of that? What had he
done but to involve them in further and more public scandal? Why,
he had not seen them during the last weeks. It was true that he
had kept away from them after the fight in Seatown, and the
fiasco of the lecture, out of a kind of delicacy, and they had
stayed away from him, he supposed, for something of the same
reason, but how ironical that he should have wrecked all his life
with Maude for the sake of people whom he never saw!</p>

<p>And Tom Longstaffe! Tom whom he loved more than any one in the
world after Maude (and more deeply than Maude in certain
spiritual ways), Tom who was more than a brother, who had seemed
part of himself, who had shared his heart with him, had not come
near him. And why should he? Was not Tom's first duty to his
daughter and Billy? His daughter had been involved already enough
with this foreigner! That was how Tom must look at him in spite
of all the devotion that they had, most truly, felt the one for
the other. It was not possible, it might be, to have a real
friendship between men of different nationalities. Their points
of view must differ so deeply. And then Tom had his religion. But
it had seemed for a time as though he and Tom had had their hands
upon the very souls of one another.</p>

<p>Now, strangely, it was the thought of Tom Longstaffe and not
of Maude that drove the sharpest agony into his spirit. It was
dark now, but he did not care nor heed. He walked swiftly up and
down the room thinking only of Tom, of their first meeting in the
mist outside the Cathedral, of the first real talk they had had
when they had smashed through their shyness, of the day when they
had walked up to the football match together, of the afternoon of
Mary's return, of fun with Billy and of evenings alone in Tom's
study when they had said very little but had felt their love for
one another like a tight wire holding them together. That had
been friendship real enough and true enough while it lasted, but
it had not lasted because Johanson had not been worthy of it,
because he had been thinking only of himself and of his ideas and
wants and ambitions. What feeling had he really given to Tom, how
much had he really considered Tom's work and Tom's religious
ideals and Tom's love for his daughter?</p>

<p>He sat down at the table again, weighed down with self-
reproach and loneliness. He was truly alone; nothing now
remained--his ideals, his dream, his work, his love, his
friendship, everything was gone for him.</p>

<p>I do not know how long he sat on there in the dark, the rain
always driving against the window and his only company, but at
last the worst temptation of all came to him.</p>

<p>He seemed to be no longer himself. Another soul sat darkly in
his body, and to this soul came the thought of putting an end to
everything. With that thought came a sense of great relief, as of
a crisis achieved and a question answered.</p>

<p>He got up and lit two candles. Then he crossed to the old worn
sofa that was against the wall, and under the sofa was his old,
shabby, black bag. He dragged this out and like a man who is
moving in a dream felt deep in it and, under shirts and collars,
found an old revolver that he had had with him ever since the old
Stockholm days.</p>

<p>He took it out and fingered it under the candlelight. There
was one shot in it. He sat down at the table, drew the candles
towards him, placed the revolver between them and leaned his head
on his hands, staring in front of him.</p>

<p>He did not think any longer. He seemed to be already dead and
the room smelt strangely empty. Several times he picked up the
revolver and looked at it and laid it down again. A slight
movement was all that was needed. It seemed to him that he was
sinking through the earth, and that when he reached a certain
depth he would crash with a bump, and that with that bump all
would be over.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was looking at the revolver so intently that he did not
hear the opening of the door.</p>

<p>Some one sat at the table beside him, but he did not look to
see who it was.</p>

<p>He and the stranger sat together without speaking.</p>

<p>The stranger put out his hand and took the revolver.</p>

<p>The stranger was Tom Longstaffe.</p>

<p>His first feeling was one of irritation, and also of unreality
and melodrama. Some one had come in and prevented him just as
they always came in in plays and stories--in what is called "the
nick of time."</p>

<p>His next sensation was one of extreme weariness. He could just
have laid his head on his arms there where he sat and dropped off
to sleep. But at last he said: "Well, Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, Johnnie. I thought I'd come and see how you were
getting along."</p>

<p>He had not put the revolver away, but had laid it on the table
on the side of him away from Johanson.</p>

<p>Johanson looked up and felt a sharp warm comfort at seeing Tom
Longstaffe sitting there just as he used to be in his black coat
and with his brown, rough face and kindly wrinkled eyes. He was
touched oddly by the rough, brown hands with the stumpy fingers
laid out there on the table. He was dragging himself up, up, up
from that deep place beneath the ground where he had been and it
took a long time.</p>

<p>They were silent for a little, then Longstaffe said:</p>

<p>"I tell you what. Do you know what time it is? It's supper
time. I'm hungry. Have you got anything to eat?"</p>

<p>That "I tell you what" was so like the old Tom that it pulled
Johanson up a long way from under the ground. He was almost all
the way up now.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Johanson said slowly, "I hadn't thought about
eating."</p>

<p>"Well, I had," Longstaffe said, laughing, "and I'm hungry, I
can tell you. I had a service at seven, and I came straight
down."</p>

<p>"If you're hungry--" Johanson said, rising. He moved about the
room at first blindly, as though he did not know where he would
go next. Longstaffe did not watch him, but went on talking,
talking about anything. Little foolish nothings. What somebody
had said about the weather, what the church looked like now there
was the new reredos. Then he began about Billy, and soon there
was more than enough for him to say. Billy had done so many
amusing things.</p>

<p>Billy was like a piece of quicksilver; why, do you know what
Billy only the other day . . .</p>

<p>Slowly Johanson, stumbling about the room in the candlelight,
came right to the surface. He did not hear what Longstaffe was
saying, but it was comforting to hear his funny jumping voice
again. Oh! yes, it was! He realised the room now and knew what he
must do. He must give Longstaffe some food. He laid the cloth on
the table, got out the cheese and the bread and the butter, lit
the fire and put the kettle on. He had a tin of corned beef. He
opened it.</p>

<p>Turning to Longstaffe, he said:</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Half-past nine."</p>

<p>Half-past nine! And he had been in that room ever since four
o'clock.</p>

<p>"It's a long time, Tom," he said at last. "We haven't seen one
another. I've missed our meeting."</p>

<p>Longstaffe looked him directly in the eyes. "We thought you'd
had enough trouble through knowing our family. We thought you'd
be up to see us when you wanted to see us. I've waited and waited
for you to come. I couldn't wait any longer."</p>

<p>Johanson said nothing to that. The kettle was boiling, so the
tea was made and they sat down to the table. Johanson ate very
little, but Longstaffe ate a great deal. He seemed truly hungry.
He went on talking, too, gaily about the things he had been
doing, the people he had been seeing, about Mary and Billy.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, Johanson broke out:</p>

<p>"Tom, if you shouldn't have come to-night . . . It's been
terrible. I've been seeing myself as I truly am. Yes, as I truly
am. I have been thinking myself fine and honest and I'm not, Tom,
I'm bad--truly bad. What have I been here but selfish and
thinking only of my ways, and what I should do here? And I have
been telling every one what they should do. Canon Ronder, he's
been so good to me, and what did I do? I went to him telling him
he was all wrong and I were all right. I don't hope you know,
Tom, all the things I've said to people. That Mrs. Bond, she
isn't much, but what right had I to tell her her boy was no good.
She loves her boy, don't she, the same way as I love you, Tom?
What should I do when some one comes and tells me you're no good?
I've just been stuck up on myself and the fine things I'll do for
this town, and what's it all come to? A foreigner knowing
nothing--that's what I am. I'm ashamed. I have no right . .
."</p>

<p>"No," said Tom quietly, lighting his pipe. "You were all
right. You had an idea. You weren't pushing your theories for
yourself, but because of your idea. Your idea wouldn't let you
alone. And your idea is fine. Perhaps you're a little simple yet,
Johnnie. You came to this town thinking it was all Paradise and
it wasn't. No place on earth is. If any place on earth was we'd
all go to it, and we aren't ready for Paradise just yet. And
you're a little simple about people too. They are more mixed than
you think them, not bad altogether, nor good altogether, but a
bit of both. You've rushed in too quickly, maybe, wanting to put
everything right at once. But I don't know. If you waited you'd
lose the force of your idea perhaps and become just like the rest
of us. It's hard to say. I've been angry myself the way they've
treated Mary, but why should I be? We all have to protect
ourselves. We none of us are safe. Life's dangerous all the time.
And so we hit out at one another all the time, loving one another
really maybe."</p>

<p>But Johanson would say no more. They sat opposite to one
another, one on either side of the fire-place, and Tom talked.
Johanson looked at him with an odd, hungry look, as though he
could not have enough of his plain face and his wrinkled
eyes.</p>

<p>Tom talked and talked. The fire died. The room was cold. He
got up at last, knocking out his pipe.</p>

<p>Johanson rose also, still not taking his eyes from
Longstaffe's face. "Good night, then," he said. "It's been kind
of you coming."</p>

<p>Holding his hand, Longstaffe hesitated. His face flushed. He
looked up to Johanson, who towered above him.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," he said, "do you know--if you don't
mind--I'd like to stop here to-night."</p>

<p>"Stop here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sleep here."</p>

<p>"But where will you sleep?"</p>

<p>"On that sofa. It's just the length. Have you got a blanket
and a pair of pyjamas?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. Of course." Then Johanson added, with a sigh, "Oh!
I'd like you to stop!"</p>

<p>"I'll look funny in your pyjamas!" They both laughed.</p>

<p>Johanson found the pyjamas and the blanket.</p>

<p>When Johanson was almost undressed Longstaffe said: "Aren't
you going to do your exercises? You always do, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Johanson, "I forgot." Stripped, under the
candlelight, he did his exercises.</p>

<p>Longstaffe, sitting on the sofa, his legs lost in Johanson's
pyjamas, watched with eager admiration.</p>

<p>"I say, you're fitter than ever! Wonderful! I wish I could
keep my body like that!"</p>

<p>Johanson paused, pleased.</p>

<p>"Am I truly all right still? Not fat?"</p>

<p>"Fat! I should think not! Not an ounce of fat anywhere. Touch
your toes again. That's something like!"</p>

<p>"Ever seen me do this?" Johanson raised himself on his toes,
raised his arms, his body stiff as though of shining metal. "I
can stay like that for ever so long."</p>

<p>The candles guttered, throwing fantastic shadows.</p>

<p>Soon Johanson was in bed and Longstaffe on his sofa, the room
dark.</p>

<p>"I say, Tom." Johanson's voice came. "I was terrible lonely
to-day. I'm glad you came. Oh! I'm glad you came!"</p>

<p>"You won't be lonely any more, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, I shan't be."</p>

<p>"Good night, old man."</p>

<p>"Good night, Tom."</p>

<h1><a name="c302">CHAPTER II</a></h1>

<h1>THE WATCHERS</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I suppose that any boy who has been living, during his early
and impressionable years, in a Cathedral town acquires two
things--a sense of romance and a sense of the past, and these two
things are only one and the same thing for some people. M. Proust
will tell you what a historical church can do for an imaginative
child.</p>

<p>But I am not at all sure that for young Polcastrians the
spirit of the town was not more potent than the spirit of the
church. That Rock to which the town clung with all its toes, that
mysterious country flowing ever away to yet more mysterious seas,
that rich and ancient blood that is the fine inheritance of the
Glebeshire native, those fights of armoured men up and down the
paths of the rocky hill, the beacon flaring from the higher peak,
the lights streaming from the Cathedral doors as they opened to
admit that sombre procession of silent monks and priests--these
things were not of yesterday but of to-day, yes, and to-morrow,
too.</p>

<p>Many a time I have heard a Glebeshire man tell his tale
truthfully and soberly enough, and then be accused of melodrama
by his hearers. "Such things," they murmur, "don't occur in
Cathedral towns." But it is not the event that is melodramatic
(and that is a poor word for a fine thing), but the Glebeshire
man's vision of it. He can no more not see it in a romantic way,
poor fellow, than help breathing. Your modern realism is of no
use to him. Why, of how ordinary a kind was the decline and fall
of poor Brandon in our town. How many times in one day's paper
will you see just such a collapse recorded, but for all of us,
happening against such a background as our Cathedral, it seemed
to involve the contest of immortal forces. "There's more in our
town than meets the mortal eye," I heard old Cassidy murmur once,
and many of us would agree with him.</p>

<p>I have noticed often enough with most of us who belong to
Polchester and Glebeshire that time seems to have no
boundaries--past, present, and future scarcely exist for some of
us, and confused and dreamy we sometimes are. Young Cole, who is
built, physically at any rate, on a stocky pattern, has told me
that when he was a tiny fellow he saw the Black Bishop in the
Cathedral. He has no doubt of it at all, nor does it surprise him
that it should have been so. There are no ghosts with us.
Physical death does not divide. Like us or no, that is the way we
are.</p>

<p>It was so now in all the town's chatter about Harmer John.
Every one was watching to see what would happen, but not only
were we--Ronder, Mrs. Bond, old Ryle, anybody you please--the
watchers, there were others, thousands and thousands of them, who
were spectators too.</p>

<p>I was very conscious of this when one day I went to take a cup
of tea with an old lady who had been often kind to me, one of the
leading characters in our town, Mrs. Combermere. She was, of
course, not so very old, but to a boy of my age, who had heard of
her as a powerful figure in his very earliest days, she seemed as
old as time. She was one of the principal figures in our town, a
downright, masculine lady, a widow who lived with her dogs and
her Tory ideas, and thought both the dogs and the ideas the best
of their kind.</p>

<p>She had inhabited the same little house in the Precincts for I
do not know how many years, and she thought that the best of its
kind also.</p>

<p>She was very faithful to old friends and did not care, as a
rule, for newcomers. Mrs. Bond, for instance, she abominated. I
could be pretty sure of my company, and, entering the little
old-fashioned candle-lit room, I found that my expectations were
justified. Her house was never very tidy, and many things that
seemed to my modern eyes unnecessary accumulated, but I expect
that she was about her possessions as she was about her friends.
When she had acquired them she liked to keep them. Herself seemed
to occupy most of the space. She was square and solid, and had
dressed in the same fashion ever since any one could remember.
She wore stiff, white collars, short skirts, a shining, black
belt at her waist, and her dark hair was brushed straight back
from her forehead. She had not even now a single grey hair, and
she smoked large, fat cigarettes and had been doing so for twenty
years.</p>

<p>I expected to find Ellen Stiles, Miss Dobell and old Doctor
Puddifoot, and those were precisely the people I did find. Old
Doctor Puddifoot had brought into the world many of my
generation; now he must be getting on for eighty, and had retired
from practice, living only for golf and port. Ellen Stiles was
the Mrs. Bond of an earlier generation, and yet that is an unkind
description because in <i>her</i> gossip malice had never been
intended. She liked to see the proud pulled down from their high
places, but also she liked to see the lowly exalted, and often in
her day had assisted in exalting them. But her day now was over.
She was simply an untidy, forlorn and shabby old maid.</p>

<p>When I had been given my chair and my cup of tea the
conversation that I had interrupted continued as though I did not
exist. Young people were not unduly flattered in the Polchester
of 1907.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was unexpectedly called upon. "But you were
there," Mrs. Combermere cried, turning round upon me sharply as
though I had committed a crime. "Tell us about it."</p>

<p>"Tell you about what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The terrible lecture and Harmer John. I hear that you and the
Cole boy saved him from being torn to pieces."</p>

<p>I answered lamely enough. For some queer reason I didn't want
to speak about it. Why? I don't know. I wasn't ashamed of myself,
and I wasn't ashamed of Harmer John either. But I didn't want to
talk about it.</p>

<p>"What did he say? What made every one so angry? Was it all
arranged from the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Of course it was all arranged," Ellen Stiles broke in. "That
horrible Samuel Hogg. He bought all the tickets and packed the
place. That poor man! I think it's a shame the way the town's
treated him."</p>

<p>"You would!" Mrs. Combermere answered. "You're as sentimental
as ever you were, Ellen, and so you'll be to the end. The point
is that the man proposed pulling the town down, and certain
people didn't welcome the idea."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "that wasn't quite the fact. What he'd said--" I
paused. What <i>had</i> he said? I wasn't sure. I broke out:
"He's a jolly fine man!"</p>

<p>Strangely enough they agreed to that, and Mrs. Combermere came
out in her strange, grumpy voice: "Of course he's a fine man--but
he's a foreigner and a simpleton. He should have known that
English people have no imagination."</p>

<p>Puddifoot, who had been lying back, stomach protruding, eyes
half-closed, in his chair, muttered:</p>

<p>"Went to his first lecture. Finest man to look at I've ever
seen. Why couldn't he stick to that instead of wanting to
interfere with everybody?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Combermere returned to me again. "But you--you've
told us nothing. Come on. Speak up. Fine man, yes--but what
more?"</p>

<p>I was held by the stupidest inhibition. I blushed and
stammered like a baby. At last I got out something; I hadn't
thought that he'd said anything to offend anybody, but that of
course they were all waiting to be offended; they had come there
intending to make a row. He talked for a long time, though,
before they interrupted--</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say during that time?" Mrs. Combermere
broke in impatiently. "That's exactly what I want to get at and
nobody can tell me."</p>

<p>I couldn't tell her either. He certainly hadn't said anything
that was very new, only that beauty was of three kinds, the
brain, the heart and the soul, and that we ought to be creating
it instead of always thinking of ourselves. And that we worried
too much whether we were happy or no and so missed the beauty
that was all around us. That our bodies ought to be beautiful and
our surroundings ought to be beautiful and our lives ought to be
beautiful and . . . and . . . as the platitudes came stammering
out of me I felt increasingly foolish. I ended: "Oh! it wasn't
what he said. He spoke like a baby, all the old things, and it
was exactly as though they were so startlingly new to him that
they must be new to every one else too. I laughed at him at
first, but you couldn't help liking him and then--when they went
for him--the odds were too damned unfair!"</p>

<p>"I do think," said Ellen Stiles, nodding her head, "that it's
most true what he said. We ought to think more of others,
certainly, and--"</p>

<p>"Oh! shut up, Ellen!" Mrs. Combermere interrupted most rudely.
"The infant here is right. There isn't anything in what he
says--anything new at least. The point is that he believes it,
that he's got an idea that's more to him than his happiness or
personal safety. That's what's affected us all. That's why we're
all frightened of him, because he's making us all uncomfortable,
because we <i>know</i> we're wrong and slack and self-satisfied
and greedy. Don't I know it about myself? Didn't I start life
with fine ideas, and where are they all gone to? Don't I know
that if I got up to-morrow morning with the resolve to think less
of myself and more of other people, determined to grumble less,
to help to rid the town of the slums, to give my two maids better
bedrooms, to go up to London once a year to see a picture gallery
and hear some music (I used to care for those things once), don't
I <i>know</i> that I could do all these things and that life
would be better worth living if I did? But I'm set, hard and
fast, and the very thought of that man going round disturbing the
place is irritating! Ever read <i>The Heir of Redclyffe,</i>
Ellen?"</p>

<p>"When I was a girl," said Miss Stiles, "and cried myself sick
over somebody's deathbed."</p>

<p>"It's that sort of priggish, moral, uplifting effect this
man's having on all of us. But he isn't a prig, so far as I can
see. He doesn't want to make a soul in the town better. He's just
got a notion, and his notion won't let him rest. After all, there
<i>is</i> something in it. If only a few of us stopped
quarrelling and backbiting and seeing only the mean side of our
neighbours and--No, it's no good." She stamped with both feet on
the ground. "I'm too old to change either myself or other
people."</p>

<p>"What's this," old Puddifoot drawled out, "that Mrs. Bond's
got hold of? About a fountain or something there behind St.
Paul's. Been there for years, and he dug it up and stuck it
together. Pretty thing, she tells me. Funny idea for a man to
have. He's a bit cracked, of course. Trained his body too hard
and gone in the top story."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's very English of you, Charles," said Mrs.
Combermere, "because a man finds something beautiful and troubles
about it you say he's mad. I must go down and have a look at the
thing. And where is the man now, anyway? They say he's living in
Seatown and is likely to be murdered at any minute."</p>

<p>"I don't know where he's living," said Ellen Stiles eagerly,
"but I do know that the police are talking of asking him to leave
the town lest there should be any disturbance. The Seatown people
are just furious with him for saying that their houses ought to
be pulled down, although they are really in a shocking state, I
believe, and you'd have thought they'd be grateful to him for
bothering. But not at all. They can't say anything bad enough
about him, and I'm sure there's going to be trouble, and then
what a scandal there'll be!"</p>

<p>"It's most peculiar," said Mrs. Combermere slowly. "There have
been plenty of foreigners in this town before, but I can't
remember anybody who has affected everybody in the way this man
has done. The truth is he's managed to put his finger on one or
two things that nobody's quite comfortable about. It's all very
well to say that we're proud of this place and there's nothing
the matter with it, but as a matter of fact we all know that
there's plenty the matter with it, only we're all too lazy or too
frightened to bother."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Ellen Stiles, changing her side now that
Polchester was down and Harmer John was up, "I don't quite see
why <i>he</i> should come and tell us all our business. What does
he know about us or England? Why should he push Mary Longstaffe
in our faces? Why should he be so rude to Canon Ronder and Mrs.
Bond and the others? Why, he said the most dreadful things to
Mrs. Bond about her boys!"</p>

<p>"Not half as dreadful as I'd say if you gave me a chance,"
Mrs. Combermere interrupted. "Of course he says rude things. If
you have an idea in your head that won't let you alone, you feel
that there isn't a moment to be lost. You <i>have</i> to speak
about it to everybody and you haven't time to think whether
you're rude or no. I had an idea once about giving dogs garlic in
their food and I couldn't rest for a minute. I had to tell every
one. Besides, who cares whether old Ronder's feelings are
hurt--greedy, self-centred tub of a man. Why--!"</p>

<p>At that moment, I remember, the maid announced Canon Ronder.
There was, of course, not the slightest sign of confusion written
anywhere on Mrs. Combermere. She did not greet Ronder very
warmly. He knew her well enough by now and did not, I suppose,
expect any great cordiality. I think that it was during this
summer that he began to deteriorate. You may connect it with
Johanson or not, as you please. Movements, men, circumstances,
come strangely together in life, and our sins, our merits, our
braveries and our indifferences seem to wait as though with
predetermined knowledge for the moment of their fulfilment.</p>

<p>You can suggest, if you like, that Johanson was Ronder's
chance deliberately offered to him, and he missed it. Or you can
shrug your shoulders and deny that the two men had any real
contact. I only know that it was just at this time that Ronder's
deterioration became obvious to everybody. He was losing touch
with himself, some one said. And some one else said that he liked
his food better than his prayers. He was certainly lazy now and
began to be less neat in his dress and careless about his
sermons. He was also less amiable than he used to be, they said,
and you never knew where you were with him. He didn't know, I
fancy, where he was with himself.</p>

<p>On this very afternoon I noticed, I remember, that he seemed
uncomfortable. It may have been that he knew that we had been
talking about him before he came in.</p>

<p>The conversation flagged and died. Then Ellen Stiles, getting
up to go, remarked:</p>

<p>"I shall go down and see that little fountain. It's a pretty
idea, I think. I expect there are all sorts of things in this
town that no one knows about."</p>

<p>"Fountain? What fountain?" asked Ronder, peering up through
his glasses.</p>

<p>"Oh! didn't you know?" Ellen Stiles was quite stirred. "Mrs.
Bond says that this man Johanson, whom everybody's talking about,
found an old fountain somewhere, dug it up, cleaned it and stuck
it together. It's very pretty, they say."</p>

<p>The effect of this on Ronder was odd.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, nearly upsetting his cup of tea.</p>

<p>"We've had enough of that man," he cried, "disturbing the town
and all law and order. He's got to go, and the sooner the better.
I spoke to Griffiths about it yesterday. He's nothing but a
charlatan of the worst kind. There seemed to be something genuine
in him at first, but he's nothing more than a vulgar tub-thumper.
He refused all my advice, wouldn't listen to my warnings,
wouldn't listen to anybody, and now, if some one doesn't get him
out of the place, there'll be some disastrous riot. But I won't
be held responsible. No, I won't! His blood will be on his own
head. He was warned often enough."</p>

<p>"But no one will dream of holding you responsible. What have
you to do with it?" Mrs. Combermere asked sharply.</p>

<p>Canon Ronder didn't answer. He sat down again. Very odd he
looked, flushed and bewildered. So odd that I thought that the
only decent thing was to leave, and leave I did.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I went out into the dusky town in a curious mind. When I was a
child I read a book that had a very odd effect upon me--Mrs.
Oliphant's <i>A Beleaguered City.</i> It is, I think, as
forgotten to-day as all the other books by that fine and plucky
lady. I cannot myself very clearly recall it, but as I recollect
it had for its theme the invasion of a certain town by the
spirits of the departed. These returning citizens crowded the
streets, pressed in upon the doors, peered from the windows and
invaded the churches, with what dramatic effect or to fulfil what
purpose I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Now as I came out of Mrs. Combermere's door into the deserted
Precincts that old book drove itself upon my mind. I doubtless
then, being in the early twenties and not very far from my
childhood, remembered the story clearly enough. It may have been
responsible for my mood, but, however that may be, I remember
that I stood upon Mrs. Combermere's threshold hesitating. It was
one of those September evenings when autumn mists seem to be on
some secret purpose, as though they shrouded the earth with their
vapours that they might the better, undisturbed, go about their
purpose of preparing the way for winter. The long stretch of the
Cathedral Green was faintly grey, the row of old houses on the
Precincts' further side showed here a gable, there a rough
chimney, here a square of shrouded light, here a roof faintly
glimmering under the prophecy of an early moon.</p>

<p>The Cathedral itself towered up gigantic above the pattern of
grey shadow. It was dark like ebony and the buttresses went
flying off into the mist as though they were the limbs of some
gigantic beast straining muscles in some urgent progress.</p>

<p>When I walked on to the path that bordered the Green I felt as
though I were pressed in upon by a crowd of figures. I was not
conscious of any movement save my own, but, to my romantic
imagination, it was as though a thickly packed crowd of persons
was waiting there for some coming event. Emerging from the small
heated room of Mrs. Combermere's tea-party, I should have felt
chilled and drawn my overcoat closer about me, but rather, as I
remember it at this flight of time, I was conscious that the
atmosphere was warm and close and thick. To persons of a clear
and ordered and realistic brain such impressions are, of course,
mere folly, but to many of us they do occur, and I should be
failing in my purpose if I did not record what I felt.</p>

<p>I crossed the Green, and it seemed to me that I was truly
elbowing my way as I went. I was not frightened or anxious
either, and it was as though I were asking myself, without any
astonishment, for what all these people were waiting.</p>

<p>When I reached the Cathedral door I was surprised to discover
that the Cathedral was not closed, and, pushing aside the heavy
curtain flap, I found that there were still lights in the choir
and that the organist was practising. I remembered that within
the next ten days there was to be a performance of the
<i>Elijah</i> in the Cathedral. Doubtless a practice for this had
but just ended.</p>

<p>No one, however, seemed to be in the great church but myself
and the organist. My steps echoed brazenly as I walked up the
nave. I had no very definite purpose in my mind. I liked the
beauty of the dim lights, the faint patterns of the carving, the
great height of the soaring roof, the round strength of the
unfaltering pillars. Then I realised that I was not alone. Some
one came out of the shadows towards me, and, with a sharp shock
of recognition, I realised that the some one was Johanson.</p>

<p>I had, of course, never before met him face to face. You could
not call that hurried encounter with him on the night of the
lecture a meeting. I was never to meet him face to face again. I
wouldn't like to say how much of this book has been built up on
this same meeting, brief though it was.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to move on, and then something compelled
me to speak to him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I said. I stopped and he stopped.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Johanson, aren't you?"</p>

<p>He said "Yes" and smiled.</p>

<p>"I haven't any right to speak to you," I went on. "But I just
want to say," I stammered a little, "that I did most awfully
admire your lecture the other night. I--I was there, you know," I
ended lamely.</p>

<p>He looked at me and then he actually recognized me, amazing
when you think of the confusion and disturbance of that evening.
"Why, of course, you were there," he said. "You came and helped
me, did you not? It was a rough ending." He held out his hand. "I
am most glad to see you again. It is fine that I have a chance of
thanking you for your assistance."</p>

<p>My chief impression as he spoke to me was that all the people
who had spoken to me about him, or, in my presence, had talked of
him, had known nothing whatever of him as he really was. I fancy
that he affected every one he met differently, and that every one
thought that their impression of him, hostile or friendly as it
might be, was the only true one. He was, of course, much taller
than I, and seemed very large in that dim light. But what I
chiefly felt was the jolly friendliness of his smile and the
extreme courtesy of his manner. When you are just at the
beginning of life and pretending to be brazenly certain about
everything in it, you are tremendously at the mercy of the
attention paid to you by your elders. And that attention has to
be just right! If there is any patronage then you don't forgive
it in a hurry. But there was no patronage in Johanson.</p>

<p>"I don't hope that you had any harm from that evening," he
said most earnestly. "They were rather rough, weren't they? They
didn't like, you see, my telling them what they ought to be
doing. And they were quite right. We none of us like it,
naturally enough. I should, perhaps, wait a bit. But that doesn't
matter here," he went on. "I wasn't expecting the doors would be
open to-night. I came in half an hour ago and they were
practising for the <i>Elijah,</i> and I sat down and listened.
Splendid singing! I had my entertainment all for nothing!"</p>

<p>Then, shyly, but as though he were really interested, he asked
me about myself--did I live in Polchester, and had I always lived
there, and didn't I think it was a beautiful town, and was I
going to be long here? I answered his questions eagerly, telling
him that I was in my first year at Cambridge, that I liked it
very much, that I had been born abroad but had come to Polchester
as a child of six and had lived there, off and on, ever since,
but that my parents lived now in London and that I had been
staying here for a fortnight with my aunt.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary with what swiftness I felt that I knew
him. I was a shy youth in those days, very much wrapped up in
myself, very suspicious of strangers and especially of
foreigners, but I would have told him gladly anything. I felt no
difference in our ages except that perhaps he seemed rather
younger than myself, but he was so kind and so friendly that he
made it very easy for me.</p>

<p>We walked about a little, he showing me first one thing and
then another that pleased him, always rather diffidently, as
though, of course, I must know so much more about this place than
he. Then we crossed over to the Brytte Monument.</p>

<p>We could not see it very clearly in the dim light, but I found
at once that here was the very enthusiasm of his heart. He went
on talking about it as though he himself had created it. He knew
every faintest mark in it, all the little figures, the flower and
fruit pieces, the ins and outs of the patterns and designs.</p>

<p>"But what do you think?" he broke out, seizing my arm in his
excitement. "What do you think I found? Down near where I have my
lodging I found a little broken fountain all under the earth with
the weeds on it. I put it together and cleaned it and cleaned the
seat near it and made it all proper. It's truly a beautiful
piece. But this is the wonderful thing! It has a date on
it--1735--and I'm quite sure it was made by the same young man
who made this monument. Yes, I'm sure. It's his work, absolutely.
No one could work his way. He was a genius, you understand.
Entirely a genius. You've read about him? Oh, you must read about
him! And I don't hope you'll think me silly, but from the first
time I saw this monument I thought I knew the young man and that
he knew me and he was wanting me to do something. What was he
wanting me to do? Why, to find his fountain. He knew it was there
all broken and dirty and he sent me to find it. Is that silly to
you? Oh, but it isn't silly! Why shouldn't it be? You must come
and look at the little fountain. You'd like it. Will you promise
me to come?"</p>

<p>Of course I promised. I would have promised him something a
great deal more difficult.</p>

<p>He would have stood there, perhaps, talking all night about
his young genius, but the organ had ceased, some one had turned
out the lights. The old Verger came to us telling us that he was
about to close the Cathedral.</p>

<p>We went out into the Precincts and through the mists the moon
was faintly shining.</p>

<p>He looked at me, as we said good-bye, as though we had been
friends all our lives.</p>

<p>"You will promise me to come?" he said again.</p>

<p>"Rather!" I answered. "Of course I will."</p>

<p>He gave my hand a great grip, nodded, smiling at me, and
strode off into the mist.</p>

<h1><a name="c303">CHAPTER III</a></h1>

<h1>PENETHEN INTERLUDE</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That agony of absolute loneliness was never to return to
Johanson again. There was at least one human being in the world
now who believed in him and loved him.</p>

<p>But those hours changed him. Every one who saw him and spoke
to him after that night is agreed that there was something new in
him--if they cared for him, it was something more gentle and
understanding; if they hated him, it was something more arrogant
and aloof. "He's playing the bloody aristocrat," some one told
Hogg.</p>

<p>I imagine that what was to worry him now most urgently was the
business of paying his way. He was almost penniless. He would in
two months' time have to find a very considerable sum of
money.</p>

<p>There were no prospects of any kind for him in Polchester, and
leave Polchester he would not.</p>

<p>Destiny, however, was to settle this question for him in its
own fashion. Meanwhile the obsession of Seatown increased with
him rather than diminished. Although he saw but few people and
bared his soul at this time to no one but Tom Longstaffe, he must
have been aware that the climax of his lecture disturbance had
raised questions far beyond his own personal fate. Many a
Polcastrian had had for a long time an uneasy conscience about
Seatown, and especially about one aspect of the question that I
have not yet mentioned.</p>

<p>I don't know how many public-houses there were in Seatown at
this time, but I fancy that roughly one was provided for every
thirty inhabitants of that district. At eight o'clock in the
morning you would find the houses all crowded, and at eleven at
night out they would all tumble, crowds of the most wretched
drink-sodden creatures this country could show. Here I may quote,
perhaps, a more eloquent writer than myself: "In the streets you
will see groups of the most utterly drink-degraded wretches it is
possible to find anywhere in the kingdom. Men with soulless,
bloated faces and watery eyes, dressed like tramps, standing idle
with their hands in their pockets. But there is not a penny
there, or they would not be standing in the mud and rain; and as
for doing any work, they are past that. Here that rare spectacle,
a man without a shirt, has met my sight, not once nor twice but
several times, the naked flesh showing through the rents of a
ragged jacket buttoned or pinned up to the neck. These loathly
objects are strangely incongruous at that spot, under those great
towers, in sight of the green, open, healthy downs. . . ."</p>

<p>Under those great towers! Yes, something incongruous indeed!
Johanson did not find any of these "objects" loathly. His heart
ached for them, and once seen by him they could not be forgotten
for a moment. Always they hung there, a dark shifting tapestry,
in the back of his mind. But what could he do? Unaided, hated as
he now was, feared as he became, he could do nothing. Unaided,
no. But, as I have said, he was aware that in the background
other faces were now stirring. It was not for him, as for so many
figures in popular romances or plays, to lead with uplifted hand
a fine movement of revolt. His hope was to wait, to hang on, to
stay until by constant reiteration of the Seatown scandal he
could force others to act with him. All his passionate desire now
was that he should be able to stay in the place.</p>

<p>He would hang on to that indifferent Rock with all the force,
spiritual and physical, that he had.</p>

<p>It needed courage. It was not easy to move about the streets
always under hostile eyes. He had outraged all the peaceful and
law-abiding conventions of the town by the disturbance that he
had made. The one desire of every one, save one or two, was that
he should go. "Throw him out and forget him!" Even the tiny
affair of the fountain was against him. What right had he to go
meddling about with our statues and works of art? Granted that
the fountain was a pretty thing, why could he not have left it to
some one else, some Polcastrian, to discover? Nevertheless, no
one interfered with it. Many people went to see it, and in one
week's number of <i>The Polchester News</i> these three questions
among others appeared in the "Do you know" column:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know</p>

<p>That Seatown streets after eight o'clock at night are a
scandal to which decent Polcastrians are able to be blind no
longer?</p>

<p>That it is time some of our Church dignitaries ceased to
frequent tea-parties and employed their valuable time among the
poor of our city?</p>

<p>That the recent discovery of a valuable work of art in our
city is causing some of us to wonder what the Town Council are
thinking about it, and whether they've got some more of the same
covered up with street rubbish which they are too lazy to clear
away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Beautiful days came with the beginning of October. The
fountain looked fine in the sun.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then one morning Johanson's landlady came and asked him
whether he would mind finding other rooms. He was not surprised.
He had been expecting this. But he was sorry for her nervousness.
She was so anxious not to hurt his feelings. She wouldn't have
bothered him for the world, but people were telling her that
there might be some trouble in the house and she couldn't have
any trouble because of mother. She didn't mind for herself,
really she didn't, but if there was any trouble and mother heard
of it, it might finish her, and then . . . She fingered her
apron. Of course he would go. He would go at once. Oh! no, at the
end of the month if he didn't mind. To give him plenty of time to
find somewhere else. . . . She didn't wish to inconvenience
him.</p>

<p>And that same morning he had another visitor--Mrs.
Penethen.</p>

<p>At the sight of her standing there in the doorway so quietly
in her long black cloak, at the first glimpse of that kind and
austere countenance, his conscience rebuked him that even in his
loneliest moments he had fancied that he was without a friend.
Hers had been the first hand that had touched his in that town,
and from the beginning until now she had been the same to him,
loyal, honest, faithful. Not a week had passed since he had left
her lodging but she had been to see him. He knew that all men
might revile and abuse him, but that she would not flinch from
him. And yet even in that first warm welcoming glimpse of her he
was aware that although she stood beside him, she also stood
apart from him--and not only from him but also from every other
human being in the world. She was, and had been for many a year,
lonely, as he could be but rarely, and, although she perplexed
him in much, he understood this, that there was something in that
odd English blood of hers that he would never understand. These
English! Queer, apart people! but even at their worst more honest
than any others that he had ever known.</p>

<p>She came in quietly, as she always did, and sat down beside
him. He had been struggling with his poor finances, striving as
many another to make them better than they were, and he had in
front of him a paper covered with figures.</p>

<p>She settled herself comfortably, and then looking at him with
that grave motherly look that he knew so well, said: "How are
you?"</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," she answered him.</p>

<p>He wasn't one to waste time when he was eager about anything
and he began at once:</p>

<p>"Tell me about Maude, please. Is she happy--with that young
man?"</p>

<p>She told me afterwards that it was always the hardest thing
for her when he began to speak of Maude. His eyes were so anxious
and distressed and so <i>childish,</i> urging her, as children do
with their elders, to tell him something good even though it were
not true. And yet, of course, it was the truth that he
wanted.</p>

<p>"Happy? Is Maude ever happy? She doesn't know what she wants
and she never will. And she wants more than ever she's going to
get. All the ha'pence and none of the kicks."</p>

<p>"But that fellow--he's not good enough for her. He can't make
her happy. Perhaps I couldn't, of course. But he can't. I know he
can't. But she should be happy--she'd be so fine when she was
happy. She needs happiness."</p>

<p>"What's all this about happiness?" Mrs. Penethen said sharply.
"There's too much talk about happiness in this world, it seems to
me. Happiness! Happiness! Happiness! All of them wanting
happiness! That's what most of them are so unhappy for. Why, you
don't think it's the first thing yourself."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he answered slowly. "Not for myself. But for
her it should be."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't her I've come to talk about," Mrs. Penethen
then answered firmly. "It's something more important. I've come
to ask you to go away."</p>

<p>"Go away!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered hurriedly. "I mean it. Oh! it's for your
good I'm asking. You know what I think of you, you know how much
I'd have done for you if I could have had my way. But just for a
while, until things are quieter. It isn't safe for you, truly
not. I know what I'm saying."</p>

<p>She says that he drew away from her then as though she had
become, in a moment, some one he couldn't trust. "I didn't think
you'd want that," he said at last. "You're my friend. Surely I
thought so. I don't hope you think I've done anything bad to run
away about."</p>

<p>"Run away! No," she answered impatiently. "But for a time you
can't do anything here. They're angry about the lecture and
things you've said, or if they're not angry, all of them, it's
Hogg and some others who are telling them they ought to be. What
do you know about how they feel here? What have you ever known
since first you came here? Why, if I'd had any idea of what it
was going to let you in for, your being in this town, and the way
they would treat you, I'd have bundled you off that first wet
night you came to my door. Indeed, it's often enough I reproach
myself for not having managed things better. But how was I to
tell that all this would come of it, and all the more when
everything went happily at first."</p>

<p>He must have seen then, I fancy, that something very real and
urgent disturbed her, driving her from her accustomed equanimity,
and that whatever her reason might be, her only motive was her
concern for himself.</p>

<p>He smiled and took one of her hands in his.</p>

<p>"What is it," he asked, "that's worrying you so badly? Are
they meaning to shoot me or what?"</p>

<p>"I can't do other than beg you to go," she answered. "I'm your
oldest friend in this town, aren't I now, and I'm old enough to
be your mother and I'm fond of you as I've never been fond of a
man since my poor husband died. There's a thing for an old woman
like me to say! But just because of that and because I've always
been honest with you from the beginning, you can believe me when
I say that it's right you should go. They mean to make you go
whether you wish it or not. And only for a time, mind. I'm not
saying for long. Just for a while, otherwise--Oh! they'll be
sitting on you one of these nights, some of those Seatown roughs,
and they're a mad lot down there, especially when they've been
drinking. Why should you mind to go? There's no shame in it!"</p>

<p>"Is this anything to do with Maude?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Maude! No!"</p>

<p>"Then I'm not going." He got up and began to walk the room.
"Of course I'm not going. Where should I go to? Do you think I
don't love this town, although they've been unfriendly just of
late? and there's Maude. Though she don't love me any more, I
must see after her a bit--in the background, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Maude! Maude!" Mrs. Penethen broke in. "I'm sick of Maude,
although she is my own daughter. What's she got to do with this?
Mind what I say. It's serious. There are those working against
you who've been against you from the first. Why give them the
chance they're wanting? Ah! go! Please go!"</p>

<p>She stood in front of him, stopping him.</p>

<p>"If it's money you're needing--" she began.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her and kissed her. Then he led her
towards the door.</p>

<p>"I'm staying," he said. "Yes, as long as I'm alive, I'm
staying."</p>

<p>She saw something in his face that told her that all appeal
was hopeless. Something, she said afterwards, that was not
himself but something stronger than he.</p>

<p>He was like a man doomed. All her way home she could think of
nothing but that melodramatic phrase "a man doomed," and then
broke into that old irritation that she had known in connection
with him from the very first. "He's stupid. Stupider than any man
should be."</p>

<p>She sat all that evening worrying in her head at desperate
schemes that would get him away from the town. But he was never
to know that it was Maude who had been her chief informant, Maude
who had urged her to go and see him, Maude who was sitting at
that moment of her mother's visit in the Boultewood's parlour
thinking her fianc&eacute; a contemptible ass, longing to see
once more that strange man with whom her life had been for a
moment connected, longing and hoping too most passionately that,
for her safety and comfort, she would never set eyes on him
again.</p>

<p>But she was to set eyes on him.</p>

<p>Two days after Mrs. Penethen's visit to him, on a fine
autumnal afternoon, he walked up to the thick lane that runs
above the villas over the top of the town high above Orange
Street. This was a favourite walk of his. Above the lane, with
only a step or two, you reached downland, and from a high point
there, on a clear day, you could discover the sea. Where the lane
allowed gates to intercept its high hedges you had a splendid
view, the green fields sloping to the town, and from the very
heart of the roofs the Cathedral rose like a gigantic ship
tugging at its moorings, seeking to float away into the sea of
sky. Seen from here the town was the town that he loved, all
beauty and peace. It did not seem so difficult, when he saw it
thus, to recover his old first vision of it and some of his old
faith in it. And when the world was so still about him, only
faint stirrings in the hedgerows, the distant roll of some cart,
the cry of a child from a near-by farm, he seemed to himself to
be approaching that moment when, if only he had sufficiently rid
himself of his own desires and his own fears and if only the
world outside were quiet enough, he would catch that whisper that
would explain everything. From his earliest childhood he had had
some expectation of the kind, so that as a little boy he would
drag at his mother's hand in the street and force her to pause
and then, hearing only the noise of the traffic in his ears,
would move impatiently forward again. Lately, in all the trouble
of his personal life the possibility of that whisper had seemed
irretrievably remote; for many a month he had not dreamed his old
dream. But now, again, after that terrible day in his room when
Longstaffe had come, he had recovered his earlier
self-possession.</p>

<p>He was at peace, as he had not been since the first days of
his engagement to Maude.</p>

<p>So he was walking along the lane, rejoicing in the crystal
stillness of the air, watching a leaf, amber coloured, twirl and
turn and twirl again, so human in its movement that he could
almost hear it sigh as it abandoned itself to submission.</p>

<p>He told Longstaffe afterwards that he would never, until he
died, forget that leaf. It seemed to have some special message
for him. He watched it as it lay, finally, lifeless on the
ground. Then, looking up, he saw Maude Penethen walking slowly,
quite alone, in front of him.</p>

<p>What the surprise of that must have been! It might seem that
it would be impossible to be for so long in the same small town
and not to meet, but it was true, nevertheless, that he had not
seen her face since that day at her mother's house when he had
had that last interview with her.</p>

<p>He could not believe now that this was she, but he knew the
blue coat and the hat with the blue feather, and then every
movement told him. There was something in her walk that seemed
dejected and lonely and went straight to his heart.</p>

<p>He did not know what to do. He stood still, staring. Only they
two alone in all the world! Should he turn back? No, he was not
strong enough for that. The sight of her, although it was only
her back that he saw, made him so hungry for the sound of her
voice and the light in her eyes that he could no more leave her
than the castaway could escape from the ship that is in sight to
save him. But perhaps she would think that he had followed her
and was to take advantage now of her loneliness? He could not
think clearly though. His heart was hammering, his eyes were
clouded. Another moment and he had said in a voice strangled by
his feeling: "Maude, Maude. Please, I must speak with you."</p>

<p>He told Longstaffe afterwards that he knew, at the moment that
she turned round and realised him, how completely and utterly he
had lost her. She was terrified--no other word for it. Terrified
as though he had been some tramp who, alone there far from any
possibility of human assistance, would offer her violence. And
whether it was of him, or of her love for him, that she was
terrified, no one will ever know. Certainly Maude Penethen, or
rather Mrs. Boultewood, of "Ivanhoe" Villa, will never say.</p>

<p>I suppose that, during all those months, she had been thinking
of him unceasingly, and as the reports of his various
misdemeanours reached her ears she must have been in a strange
confusion of thanking her stars that she was not married to him
and longing for his embraces.</p>

<p>At least that is how I see her. Many people after the event
expressed wonder that he should have cared for her. But, having
the heart that he had, the mixture of her fear of him and her
longing for him touched him everywhere. She was, too, her
mother's daughter, lonely and apart against her will. She would
regret him to the day of her death. She gave Boultewood no easy
time, I fancy. But she clung to safety and the things that she
knew. Safety and the good report of the world.</p>

<p>When she saw him she looked desperately about her and then
said: "Don't. Don't. I don't want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"We must speak," he answered gravely, recovering his
self-control. "It isn't right that we shouldn't. I shan't hurt
you or say anything wrong. You know I've never hurt you, have I?
I only want your happiness--no one wants it so much as me."</p>

<p>She told her mother later, when haughtily she gave her version
of the meeting, that if he hadn't looked so unhappy she wouldn't
have stayed with him. But I fancy that that was her romantic
gloss on the situation. I don't imagine that he was unhappy at
all or sentimental. His love for her was so settled a thing in
his heart that after the first shock of the unexpected encounter
he quite quietly set about the business that the opportunity of
the meeting gave him--to see whether there were any way in which
he could help her.</p>

<p>For myself I believe that she fell under his spell again
immediately, and that if he had thrown his arms around her she
would at the moment have done anything he asked her. He had not
lost her the less absolutely for that. Later all the old fear
would have returned and returned only the more strongly.</p>

<p>But, of course, he did not fling his arms around her. He did
not even touch her hand, as she was very careful afterwards to
tell her mother.</p>

<p>He told Longstaffe that it was surprising how quickly they
fell into their old way, talking quietly, he asking her questions
and she giving him answers that at least if they were not true
were what she wanted him to believe. His one eager desire was not
to frighten her and for a while he did not.</p>

<p>"Maude, allow me just for these minutes to think that I have a
right to ask you about yourself. Are you happy and
comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'm happy and comfortable," she answered him. "Why
shouldn't I be?" That in the old sharp way. Then more softly:
"I'm glad we've met after all this way, because there's something
I've always been wanting to tell you. I didn't treat you rightly
when you were with us. I didn't, indeed. I was just hateful. But
you weren't like any one I'd ever seen before and perhaps if we'd
married at once and gone away out of this place . . . But I don't
know--" She looked at him then almost appealingly as she went on,
and how, for the next days, he was to remember the look! "I'm not
much of a girl. I'm not, truly. You're lucky to be rid of me.
I've been spoilt. That's what it is, I expect. And I don't want
to change either. You're the only one who could have changed me,
but I'd have fought you for trying to. We'd never be happy
together. And there's another thing. You made me think of all
sorts of ideas I didn't want to think of. You wouldn't leave me
alone, would you? You said you wanted us both to be free, but you
wouldn't be contented until I did and thought what you wanted me
to."</p>

<p>That was penetrating of her. "It might be I'd have learnt
too," he answered her. "I've learnt something since I came away
from you, Maude. Oh! I've wanted you so. You don't know how I've
wanted you."</p>

<p>The temptation then to take her in his arms was terrible. He
had to stop where he was and think of her. If he thought of her
enough, her helplessness and easily roused fear of him, the
temptation weakened, but if he saw her only in a mist of all his
longing--</p>

<p>He stood, gazing over the break in the hedge and the green of
the sloping field swung up to the blue autumn sky, and the thin
veil of smoke above the town enveloped him in its spidery
haze.</p>

<p>She stood quietly beside him. It might have been his moment.
Who can tell? He conquered it and walked on, not looking at
her.</p>

<p>"Let's not talk of the past," he said. "I was wrong, but I was
very ignorant. You were the first woman I'd ever loved, and you
shall be the last. Also it isn't easy for a foreigner to love an
English woman. You mistook sometimes the things I said, and I was
so eager to have you always and I was jealous--"</p>

<p>She felt, I think, that she had just escaped a great danger,
and she began hurriedly: "And now aren't you going to leave
Polchester for a while? I know you haven't meant anything by what
you've done here, but what you say is true, I expect, that you
are a foreigner and don't understand the way people feel here.
English people are funny. They don't want to be told what they
ought to do. They're angry with you, some of them. Won't you go
away for a little until it's all quiet again?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling. "No, I won't go away. Don't you
see why I can't? Don't you see that the two things in the world I
love, the two things I think the most beautiful, are here,
Polchester and you. I don't hope you think I'm rude to say that
to you when you're engaged to be married now to another man, but
I don't mean it in any way that can offend you. I know, of
course, that it's better for us not to see one another. I shan't
try to meet you. Indeed I shan't. But the time may be when you'd
want a bit of help. I don't," he went on laughing, "seem just now
anybody to help another very much, but it shan't always be. I
have friends here, and I am young and strong. You may want me one
day, and it would be terrible that I wasn't here. And then I
can't leave Polchester. It isn't what I think when I first came
here, but perhaps it's something better. No, I can't go away,
Maude, thank you very much."</p>

<p>Once more he had, I believe, a chance. What could she think,
contrasting that oaf Boultewood with the man beside her? If she
was happy, what was she doing walking all alone up there by
herself that day, she who hated to be alone? But it was well for
him that she didn't give him his chance. There was a better
destiny waiting for him than anything that Maude could offer
him.</p>

<p>She continued to try to persuade him to go, but felt as her
mother had felt before her, that there was some stronger
resistance there than she could conquer.</p>

<p>They had come to the point where the broad road up from
Polchester met the lane. He stopped in front of her, looking at
her, as though it would be the last time that he would ever see
her.</p>

<p>"Remember then," he said, "that though you can't love me
you're the only love of my heart. There won't be ever another.
All that's good in me, Maude, is yours. If it may be one day
you're lonely or unhappy, it shall be, perhaps, a comfort to
think that there's some one who loves you and can't ever change.
It's a happiness to me that I've been able to say to you: 'If all
the world comes to tell you that I've gone away and left you, it
won't be true.' But I don't want anything of you, Maude. I don't
want anything of any man, and, I think, that's surely the way to
be happy. Don't you think of me, if you think at all, as unhappy.
I've had my unhappy times, but I'm a happy man. And I'll be happy
serving you, even though you don't know I'm doing it."</p>

<p>She was frightened then. Something in his look, in the way he
held himself, brought back her old fear. She told her mother, "He
didn't look human, somehow. The thing that's foreign in him came
out and frightened me."</p>

<p>She expected, perhaps, that he would kiss her, but he didn't
move even to touch her hand. She nodded, tried to smile in an
easy fashion, then started quickly down the hill.</p>

<p>He stayed there looking after her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c304">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>

<h1>OCTOBER 7: ON THE HILL</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I believe that that meeting with Maude raised him to the
height of all imaginable happiness. It may seem strange that it
could be so, but it restored to him, I fancy, the one possession
whose loss it had been hardest for him to bear--his right to care
for her. He had, for months, lost all touch with her; now,
although he might not see her, he would know that she was
conscious of him, that she knew that he was there, and that if
unhappiness or trouble came to her it would be to thought of him
that she would turn.</p>

<p>Johanson was human, a great deal more human than many, and
whether that altruistic condition of feeling would have contented
him for long, who can say? It may have been one of his "lucks"
that that particular test was not to be offered to him.</p>

<p>In any case the boy that was still in him helped him to react
with extraordinary swiftness from one mood to another. He was now
as happy as he had been in his first Polchester days. He rushed
in at once to tell Longstaffe all about it. He gave him the
minutest account of his meeting with her, every detail. He was
filled to the brim with new plans. What was he going to do? Well,
the next thing was that he intended to live down there in the
very heart of Seatown. Yes, he did. That was the only way to do
anything. He wasn't going to missionise them or improve their
minds or anything of the sort. He was going to know them, and
they were going to know him. He thought he could earn enough
teaching a few some exercises, a little boxing, maybe. Or he
would <i>make</i> things. He was quick with his hands and could
make a wooden box as well as any one. It wouldn't cost him much
to live down there--that was one certain thing.</p>

<p>I think it was then, for the first time, that Tom Longstaffe
became seriously alarmed. In spite of everything that had
happened Johanson seemed to have no true realisation of the way
that those men hated him. If Seatown had become an obsession to
<i>him</i>, <i>he</i> had certainly become an obsession to them,
and it was that most dangerous of emotions, ignorant crowd hatred
fanned by Hogg or another to a sort of fanaticism. Johanson was
"the bloody foreigner" to them, and they "were going to bleeding
well chuck him out"--and here was he planning happily to live in
their midst.</p>

<p>Longstaffe tried to show him some of this, but he didn't care
that day. He had seen Maude again, he was to be allowed to look
after her, he was to begin his work again, honestly now in the
way that he wanted it.</p>

<p>He was lonely no longer, workless no longer, homeless no
longer. Then his dream came back to him again.</p>

<p>One night, physically tired out with a walk that he had taken
all day with Longstaffe across the Downs towards the sea, he fell
at once on tumbling into bed into heavy sleep.</p>

<p>He had poured everything out to Longstaffe, telling him many
things for which this narrative is the richer. They had been,
both of them, so happy together that there had come a moment
when, standing on a shoulder of the moor and looking out to the
thin purple scarf of the sea, it had seemed to them possible to
go on--and never to come back. A moment's dazzling illusion of
eternal happiness, swinging through air into space, with no duty,
no foreboding, no regret to burden them. Then, laughing, they had
turned back. It was in many ways the happiest and fullest day of
their lives. Longstaffe at least was never to know such a day
again.</p>

<p>And now, closing happily his eyes, he swung at once into the
place from which for so many months he had been excluded. For it
was like that, as though he were returning to his own place after
a long absence abroad. He was walking up the long smooth path. A
cool pale light was in the air. The white house stood open and
waiting for him. The flowers, the trees, the stream that tumbled
over the stones between the lawns all greeted him without wonder
or surprise, but with an infinite quiet pleasure.</p>

<p>He moved with an incredible freedom and ease. The house when
he reached it was shining with light. It was empty of everything
and yet strangely filled. There again were the gleaming stairs
and beyond them the long still gallery. Looking out from a window
of the gallery, he smiled with joy when he saw once more the line
of plum-coloured hills, the dark texture of the trees framing
them, the sun sparkling behind the darkness, when he heard the
singing of the birds and, coming up to him from below, the
chatter of the stream.</p>

<p>Oh! but he was glad to see it again! He was home now. He could
rest and think and listen. And soon--he knew it as though he had
been informed of it--a message would come to him there. He would
be told what to do.</p>

<p>His part was to wait there listening for the message. . .
.</p>

<p>Next morning he woke to find the sun pouring into his room.
While dressing he discovered this written on a grubby piece of
paper and pushed under his door:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">IF YOU DONT LEEVE THIS TOWN SOON</p>

<p align="CENTER">YOU WILL BE THRONE OUT.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He smiled at that. He felt strong enough to-day for
anything.</p>

<p>He spent the morning writing part of a fairy-story for Billy.
He couldn't write English. But that didn't matter. It was plain
enough for the child to understand just as though he were
talking.</p>

<p>This thing had begun a long while ago. He had told Billy
stories when they were out walking together, and he had
discovered, very much to his own surprise, that he was crammed
with stories. He didn't know where they came from. Perhaps his
mother had told them to him, or told him pieces, and he himself
had added the rest.</p>

<p>Once he began there seemed to be no reason why he should stop.
The Swedish forest, the long seashores, the islands beyond
Stockholm, these were soon peopled with a moving, stirring world
of dwarfs with peaked red caps, kings stirring with their
jewelled sceptres their piles of glittering treasure, the
wood-cutters' huts and the wolves that threatened the
wood-cutter's little daughter, the dark silent pools on whose
lonely banks princes, turned by evil magicians into frogs,
croaked for some one to come and deliver them--no, there was no
end to them, and Johanson was as deeply excited by them as was
Billy. Then Billy wanted an old one over again, and Johanson
couldn't remember, so there came the order that they must be
written down. That was what Johanson was now laboriously doing.
He was in the middle of the best one: "The King's Daughter and
the Humpbacked Prince."</p>

<p>After his frugal midday meal he thought because it was so
lovely a day that he would go and see whether Tom or Billy or
Mary would come for a walk.</p>

<p>The whole town was glittering with light as in one of his own
fairy-stories. Passing through the market-place he saw old Looney
sitting there. He was asleep, his head fallen forward on his
chest. The warm sun was too much for him. For the first time for
many a day he had ceased to watch. Who knew but that fate,
malicious a little, would choose that very moment to produce the
crisis for which Looney had so long been waiting?</p>

<p>Coming up to the house he saw Billy on the lawn trying to
stand on his head. He could manage it almost, he cried to
Johanson, telling him to stop and watch, if his legs wouldn't be
so wobbly. He commanded Johanson to hold his legs; then
everything was fine. He could see the tree all upside down, and
the smoke from the chimney was like a flag. Then he began to
choke and Johanson turned him over.</p>

<p>Tom Longstaffe came out on to the lawn.</p>

<p>"Mary and Billy were going up to Parmiter's Field," he said.
"Why not go up with them?" Parmiter's Field is a famous spot in
our country, because from there you can have one of the finest
views in all Glebeshire.</p>

<p>"I had come to ask for a walk," Johanson answered, picking
Billy up and holding him in the air with one straightened arm.
And that was the way that Longstaffe would always afterwards see
him, his legs stiff, his head thrown back, he laughing and the
sun broken into fragments by the dark tree circling round
him.</p>

<p>Mary came out, and the three started off. By the gate Johanson
turned back.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Tom," he cried.</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"See you soon."</p>

<p>"Come in to-morrow evening and we'll have a talk."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>Longstaffe stood there looking after them. He had a funny
impulse, he told me afterwards, to call Johanson back for a
moment. He had something. . . . No,he had not. . . . He went back
reluctantly into his study. He sat there for a long time staring
over his pipe at the thought of his friend.</p>

<p>They went gaily up the hill. The day was so beautiful that
every one was happy. A little nondescript dog, who had no home
and no family, looking about for something exciting to do, went
with them. He was a funny little dog with a head too large for
his body, and although during the short span of his days he had
had nothing but kicks and abuse, nevertheless, he was still
confident in life and expected it at any moment to do him some
wonderful turn.</p>

<p>Johanson was always very much at his ease with Mary. She was
so quiet and so sensible that he could tell her everything. They
never reached a greater intimacy than that, and they never would,
perhaps because she was so sensible. The one passionate
experience of her life was behind her, and she would never have
another. Even her love for her child was not passionate. She was
writing a book, she told Johanson, a book about certain famous
women, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Martineau, Emily Bront&euml;
and some others. That was the first of that series of works by
which afterwards she made her name.</p>

<p>She told him about the book, and he told her about anything
that came into his mind, and at last about the dream that he had
had the night before. Dreams, she told him frankly, she didn't
believe in. Well, but if during many years the same dream
returned to you again and again? Something to do with your
digestion, she fancied. And Johanson laughed, tossing his head.
"You won't believe in anything, Mary, unless it is sensibly
explained, will you?" And she agreed, gravely, that she thought
that everything had its sensible explanation.</p>

<p>Soon they reached the moors, and their feet were treading the
springy turf. Whereas the wet, windy autumn days are full of
melancholy and the spirit of distraction, the warm days when the
sun beats down upon a world almost breathless in its sense of
suspense are full of reassurance and comfort. All that full
summer is gone, but now we can confidently hope because we feel
that at the very instant of death new seeds are being sown, new
colours are being born, new life is pushing forward. Standing on
these moors on such a still, sunlit day as this, time stands
motionless. All the past--the life of the Saxon, Dane, Roman,
Briton--is continuous with ours, and because the pageantry of
summer is withdrawn we can see the more plainly things that those
vanished glories had hidden.</p>

<p>From Parmiter's Field on such a day as this you could draw
within your arms a vast sweep of hill and valley, black bunches
of wood, isolated farms gleaming white through their trees,
streams of silver thread, and best of all the slow, rounded
shoulders of the Downs. Polchester flamed beneath the sun,
windows sparkling like eyes, the Pol bending it in and the
Cathedral crowning it.</p>

<p>They threw themselves down upon the warm, dry turf, and the
small dog growled like a kettle and rushed at imaginary enemies,
and then abandoning himself flung himself down against the warm
hollow of Johanson's thigh and lay there panting, his tongue out,
his shaggy eyes sparkling with pleasure.</p>

<p>Now was the time for the story to be continued. No other thing
would keep Billy still. Johanson turned over, lying full length
on his stomach, his head propped between his hands, staring at
the vast curtain of sky and seeing, over the brow of the moor,
the Polchester roofs, the Cathedral crouched like a man, and the
rising fields.</p>

<p>"When the dwarf came to the wood it was nearly dark. He
couldn't see very clearly because, as you may remember, he had
only one eye and he wasn't brave either. 'I don't hope you think
I'm frightened,' he called out just to comfort himself. Somebody
laughed. He couldn't see nobody, although he turned to the left
and the right and everyway, but somebody was laughing--"</p>

<p>"I know," shouted Billy, too badly excited to be silent. "It
was the woodcutter's daughter."</p>

<p>"Hush, Billy," said Mary. "You mustn't spoil the story."</p>

<p>"It were <i>not</i> the woodcutter's daughter," said Johanson.
"He looked everywhere about him and he said out loud, 'Who's that
laughing?' 'Wouldn't you like to know?' said a voice above him,
and looking up he knew that some one was in a tree, but yet he
could not see who that somebody was. And then--right at his
feet--something dropped, and he could see although it was almost
dark that it was a beautiful pearl, the loveliest and the
roundest pearl any one had ever seen, all white and shining.</p>

<p>"'Pick it up,' said the voice, and although he had the
rheumatism very badly, he bent down to pick it up, and when he
had it in his hand it was just an ugly bit of nasty coal. Then he
was so angry he stamped with his foot in his rage, and the voice
laughed again and said, 'If you're as angry as that you'll never
find the golden key,' which was what he had come into the wood to
discover, you shall remember. 'I'm just wasting my time,' he
said, and he was going off when another beautiful pearl fell at
his feet. He was so greedy that although he had the rheumatism
and was in a hurry to be gone, he had to stoop down and pick it
up. But when that was in his hand that was a piece of coal too,
and this time he was so angry that he took off his fine red cap
and threw it on the ground and stamped on it.</p>

<p>"'You'll never find the golden key if you get so angry,' said
the voice again--"</p>

<p>And so the story went on. No movement in all the world. They
must have seemed like painted figures there against the rim of
the moor and the great scoop of blue sky from whose texture the
colour slowly drained, leaving it even paler as though to prepare
for the ardent glories of the sunset.</p>

<p>"There, then, that's enough," Johanson said. "The story's
finished for to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Billy cried. "It isn't finished. I want--"</p>

<p>But Johanson didn't answer. It seemed to Mary Longstaffe that
he had been gradually losing knowledge of what he was saying. The
words had tumbled from him drowsily, almost as though he were
falling asleep, and yet his eyes were wide open and staring.</p>

<p>Billy asked no more, but played with the dog, who had wakened
and was biting at anything he could see.</p>

<p>"Mary," he said, not turning to her, but still staring before
him. (She said afterwards that his whole body as he lay there had
the tenseness of expectation, so that she herself looked out to
the horizon wondering what it was that he saw.) "Isn't it a funny
thing that I shall have been here in this place all this time and
done nothing except put together a little broken bit of
carving?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what you may have done," Mary answered
sententiously. (I can hear her saying it. Mary was always a
little sententious.) "Nobody knows the result of their own work.
You may have influenced many more people than you know. You have,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>He did not seem to have heard her. "It's an odd thing," he
said. "To-day I'm right back to when I were a boy. There seems to
be no time between. I come clattering up the stairs, you know,
and I look out of the window half-way up the stairs and there's
all the roofs covered with snow, and a blue star shining, and I
say with a thump of the heart, 'It's beautiful,' and I'm sad
because it's beautiful. And I run a bit up the stairs and then
run back to see it once more in case the star should be away. But
there it still is and it's like as though I take it in my pocket
and keep it there.</p>

<p>"And then I run upstairs, and there's father washing his head
because he's been drinking too much, and mother's crying, and for
the first time I'm not afraid of him. For the first time, yes,
because of the star in my pocket. . . .</p>

<p>"Strange! Strange! I have it all round me here--the clock with
the face of the moon and the old picture of the skating in the
snow and the cage with the yellow canary--and father splashing
the water about the floor, looking through the towel like a beast
at me. Mary, what does life mean? What is driving us for ever to
do other than we want, never to be easy and quiet?"</p>

<p>"God is driving us," she answered.</p>

<p>"God! God!" he replied. "This word! It is so easy and it means
nothing. But Beauty! That's a word now that means something, and
I know to-day that I've come at last to the way to have beauty,
to touch it as I touched that star.</p>

<p>"To-day I want nothing for myself and I fear nothing for
myself. I have lost myself. I am empty of myself. Always before I
wanted something for me. Me, Hjalmar Johanson. But now I will
begin to love beauty away from myself and to make things for
others. And perhaps after all this beauty is the same as your
God, Mary. I know it is the same as love. It is part of the woman
I love and the place I love and the work I love. But it isn't for
me any more. It's for something greater than myself. I can die
to-night and it goes on, I go on, we all go on for ever, and all
things are more beautiful and more beautiful until at last all is
beauty."</p>

<p>It was something like this that he talked, and I suspect,
although she never confessed it, that to Mary it all seemed very
childish. She had read so much and had so good a brain that
Johanson was always to her like an ignorant, uneducated boy. She
didn't like him the less for that, but she liked him for other
qualities, his loyalty, courage, honesty, not for his
intellect.</p>

<p>I suspect, too, although this also she never admitted, that
she gave him then a nice concise pocket philosophy of her ideas
about life (the sort of things that wise men publish--"How to
live wisely," in fifty pages of neat tidy print), but I don't
imagine that he listened to her. He liked her, too, for all sorts
of things, for her honesty, courage and loyalty, but not for her
intellect.</p>

<p>But she remembers that he said at last, "I'm so happy to-day,
happier than ever before. I have people to love and work to do
and I fear nothing, I want nothing. How lovely the world is and
how quiet and how still. Just the time to listen for a message
from somewhere. I can feel the earth under me and the sky above
me and my body's fit and my brain's clear. I'm hungry and
thirsty, the sky's full of colour, the trees are turning brown, I
hate no one. I have friends and a woman I love. . . . I'll build
a town one day, Mary, that shall be the most beautiful town ever
seen, with white towers and streets of fine stone, fountains and
a great hall, gardens of every flower and woods to shelter when
it's hot, and squares for processions, and every man shall have
his own place free for himself and work that he may enjoy and
time to see beautiful things, and no one shall be afraid of
anything, and there shall be the finest bands playing you ever
heard!"</p>

<p>But it was turning chilly, and Mary was afraid lest Billy
should catch a cold. So she got up and brushed the soil from her
dress and said she thought they must be going.</p>

<p>Johanson wanted to stay a while, so, Billy waving his hand a
great many times, they left him. Only the little dog for some
mysterious reason stayed with Johanson.</p>

<p>He remained there a long time. I hope that he had a
magnificent sunset. No one can remember what the sunset was like
that day.</p>

<p>The only witness was poor old Mr. Shortt, who told some one
afterwards that he was taking a walk up there, and saw some one
standing gazing at the sunset.</p>

<p>When he saw that the "some one" was Johanson he meant to speak
to him. He had had every grievance against Johanson during the
last months and had complained bitterly of him everywhere. But he
was a miserable old man and couldn't afford grievances when there
was a chance of making a penny or two. So he advanced towards
him, apparently intending to speak to him. But for some reason or
other he didn't. He couldn't himself explain it. The man was busy
with his own thoughts--"just as though," Mr. Shortt said, "he
were speaking to some one." And then with a desire, I suppose, to
show his audience that he was still capable of the most
gentlemanly feelings: "He was wrapt in his own thoughts and
looked so pleased about something that naturally I wouldn't
interrupt him."</p>

<p>So he went away and left Johanson standing there.</p>

<p>He came down into the town in the dusk with the little dog at
his heels. Several people saw him--young Walter Pearce, Aaron
Sharpe, Mildmay.</p>

<p>Mildmay, who had too genial a digestion and, as auctioneer,
too general a profession to quarrel with anybody, spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Johanson," he said, "you look as though some one had
left you a fortune."</p>

<p>Johanson, laughing, answered him something and swung on. It
must have been nearly dark when he reached his lodging. Running
upstairs, he was met outside his door by his landlady.</p>

<p>"Mr. Johanson," she said, agitated as usual, "the boy would
wait." She, too, noticed and afterwards recorded that "he looked
as happy as anything."</p>

<p>"Boy! What boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The one that's been here before. He's in your room and
brought 'is dog with 'im too."</p>

<p>Johanson knew then that it must be Husky, and sure enough it
was he, standing in the dusk holding on to his mongrel.</p>

<p>He smiled his confiding smile and explained that he had come
there because of his aunt--"she was terrible bad and wouldn't see
no one but Mr. Johnson." This old woman, a drunken old thief and
responsible at an earlier time for the most villainous,
disorderly house in Polchester, had been from the first one of
Johanson's fiercest opponents. Husky lived sometimes with her,
sometimes with a sick mother and sometimes with himself, but his
old aunt coloured his conversation more than any other human. She
was the only creature alive whom he feared, and apparently
because he feared cared for in a sort of way. It was perhaps
admiration rather than affection. She was the wickedest,
filthiest, hardest-swearing member of his circle and so stood for
something.</p>

<p>Johanson must have doubted when he heard that she wanted him.
It wasn't in him to suspect tricks or plots, but he must have
doubted. But Husky wouldn't lead him into trouble. Then Husky
advised him not to go. He had told his aunt that he would deliver
the message, and now, having delivered it, in his queer, broken
voice he gave it as his opinion that he'd better go back and just
tell his aunt that he couldn't find Mr. Johnson. Why, Johanson
asked him, wasn't his aunt really ill? Oh yes, she was terrible
bad. Dying, the doctor said. And she had a sort of idea that Mr.
Johnson could keep her alive. Doctors were no bloody good. At
least that was her opinion. But she was sick all right. Terrible
sick.</p>

<p>Johanson must have been reluctant to go. He had had so good a
day and he wanted to sit in his room and think about it. At least
that's apparently what he said to Husky, that he wanted to stay
in his room and think about something. That stuck in Husky's mind
because it seemed to him so very odd a thing for any one to want
to do. He never wanted to stop and think about anything. However,
Husky was relieved. He didn't mind his old aunt dying, and he had
his own private reasons for thinking it better that his friend,
Mr. Johnson, shouldn't go down there to-night. So he jerked the
piece of string that attached the mongrel to his person and
prepared to depart.</p>

<p>Then Johanson changed his mind. No, he would go. If the old
woman were really ill, and asked for him, he must go. Did she
die, and he not going, he would reproach himself. In an hour he
would be back.</p>

<p>A funny mood then invaded young Husky. He didn't want his
friend to go. There were a lot down there who might do Mr.
Johnson some damage. They had been talking about it for weeks. He
could go down in the morning. After all his aunt might not die
to-night. She had been ill for days and nights. This was just a
fancy she'd taken into her head to see Mr. Johnson. He'd just go
back and tell her that Mr. Johnson had been out and he'd left a
message.</p>

<p>But now Johanson had made up his mind. He was going, and that
was all there was about it. He saw, perhaps, a change of mind in
the Seatown populace. If this old creature turned to him, who
also might not turn?</p>

<p>Husky kicked the dog to ease his feelings a little, and led
the way down the stairs.</p>

<p>From the moment of his leaving his rooms to the witness of
Rufus the doctor nothing is very clear. Something happened on the
way down, because Johanson didn't reach the foul apartment of
Husky's aunt until nearly eight o'clock. That is, they took close
upon an hour to go from Johanson's rooms to the farther end of
Seatown. Husky can explain very little. He says that Mr. Johnson
stopped to speak to somebody and that he couldn't see "who the
bloke was."</p>

<p>I believe that somebody--Romilly perhaps?--did his utmost to
prevent Johanson from going on. I have tried in every way
possible to discover who that somebody was, but at this distance
of time accuracy is difficult. Longstaffe, Ronder, Mrs. Penethen,
Mary, Miss Midgeley, even Maude Boultewood have an astonishingly
clear picture of all their contacts with him, but when you pass
from the witness of these four or five people you pass into the
world of legend, and legend, often enough, of a curiously
flamboyant and sentimental kind.</p>

<p>We shall never know, I suppose, who had that half-hour's talk
with Johanson. It must have been urgent or Johanson would not
have stayed. I like, as I have said, to think that it was
Romilly. Sentimental? Well, people of Romilly's natural animal
order are what more sophisticated beings call sentimental. They
are not afraid of making fools of themselves. They simply don't
think about it.</p>

<p>Dropping down into that old Seatown at night was an
adventurous affair. There were very few lights and many holes and
stumbling-places. Very little life to be seen until the crowd
tumbled, reluctantly, out of the public-houses.</p>

<p>On this particular evening there was a wonderful sky of
burning, flaming stars and a thin slip of an orange moon.
Seatown, silent and starlit, had its beauty. The river, owing to
a recent fortnight of rain, was running high, almost to the top
of the river wall.</p>

<p>Dr. Rufus died after a severe bout of delirium tremens in
1912, but he told Longstaffe something of the events of that
evening. His was not a very glorious part in the business, and he
alluded huskily to the necessity of his visiting another patient
when his retirement from the scene asked for explanation. But I
don't know that one can blame him exactly. He had always hated
Johanson, and it would have been a little melodramatic of him to
offer his very useless carcass . . . But it might, after all,
have been better than the delirium tremens.</p>

<p>He was there, standing over Husky's aunt, when Johanson and
Husky came in. Three old women (Mrs. Clay and Mother Harper were
two of them), like the "Macbeth" witches, attended Mrs. Furkins'
(such was the name of Husky's aunt) departure. For light there
were two candles whose flame blew in the breeze that came in
through the broken window-pane. It was good that the pane was
broken, because the smell in the room was, apparently,
appalling.</p>

<p>Rufus, in spite of himself, admired Johanson for coming. He
was, I suppose, as drunk as usual, but not too drunk to notice a
good deal of what passed. He said afterwards that if Johanson
hadn't been always so damned interfering he would have admired
him. Johanson, he confessed, was the sort of man that he might
himself have been if everything hadn't been against him. But
everything had been against him from the first: he didn't care
who knew it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Furkins was stout and red even in the hour of her death,
and was in complete possession of her faculties. The three
witches stood at the foot of the miserable bed and looked at her
gloomily.</p>

<p>They told her it was lucky for her that she was dying without
pain and drew lively pictures of other and much more painful
deathbeds.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Furkins was in terror, abject, gasping, tortured
terror. Terror of death. She believed in hell fire and no
reassurances on the part of Rufus could comfort her. Only one man
could reassure her about death, and that was "Armerjohn." Once,
and over again, she repeated his nickname, as though it were a
talisman against death. "Armerjohn, Armerjohn, Armerjohn . .
."</p>

<p>Some woman apparently had died in Seatown a few weeks earlier
and Johanson had been with her. Something he had said had
reassured her. Mrs. Furkins had heard of this. She was not
terrified because of her sins. Her sins didn't bother her. After
all there were many worse. She could give plenty of instances.
But this hell with its perpetual burning, its little red devils
with pincers, its shrieks and groans and agonies, and all for
ever--for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Somewhere, from her far, far distant childhood this picture of
hell, after years of dismissal, had peered up at her again. For a
week now she had seen nothing else. Only Armerjohn could reassure
her.</p>

<p>The old women at the foot of the bed (fuddled with drink) were
themselves alarmed. Long while since they had thought of hell.
But it was well known that just before you kicked the bucket you
saw things clearly, and if Carrie Furkins was destined for hell
then were they also. They expected, then, the arrival of Johanson
with a good deal of interest. They were eager to see what he
would do.</p>

<p>What he did was to go over to the bed of the old woman, draw a
rickety chair and sit down beside her. He paid no attention to
Rufus. After Hogg, he abominated Rufus more than any one in the
town. Nor did he greet the three witches. Carrie Furkins gulped
with relief when she saw him. Gasping she explained to him that
she knew that she was about to die, and was going to hell, and
that the idea that she had of hell was giving her no end of a
fright. She didn't want no parson's business about her sins and
praying for mercy and the rest of it. She wasn't going to pray
for mercy to any one. But she understood that he knew more about
hell than any one else in the place, perhaps because he was a
foreigner. He had given a lot of comfort to Mary Armstrong some
weeks back when she was worrying about the same thing. Would he
tell her what he had told Mary Armstrong?</p>

<p>The room listened attentively. Even Rufus thought that he
might hear something to his advantage. Johanson looked at Mrs.
Furkins kindly and told her, as simply as though he were speaking
to Billy Longstaffe, what were his ideas of the matter. He told
her that whatever she'd done (and he was sure that she had done a
lot of things that she'd better not have done) that no hell was
eternal, that everything was always changing and that he believed
that Mrs. Furkins would find that physical death made very little
difference to her condition. She would have to mend her ways
after she was dead and set about being a little more useful and a
little less harmful to others. There would probably be people to
help her, and she would have to work a lot harder than she had
hitherto done.</p>

<p>On the other hand she would be stronger and would be rid of
all the mess that drink had for so many years been making of her.
He might be wrong about other things, but there would be no fire
and no pincers. That he could promise her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Furkins raised herself in her bed and smiled triumphantly
at the three witches. What had she told them? This feller knew
more than all the rest of Polchester together, parsons and all.
She sank back on her grubby pillow with a mutter of relief and,
then and there, passed away.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Rufus and the old women. Johanson found
the smell of the room overpowering. He moved to the door, opened
it, and, to his amazement, found the rickety staircase crowded
with figures. They had not, I suppose, come into the room of the
dying woman because they were held back by some sort of
superstition. They were waiting for him outside.</p>

<p>While he stood there peering into the dusk, Rufus slipped out
beside him and vanished down the stairs.</p>

<p>His first thought must have been that they were all going to
some function on the upper floor. Young Husky, to whom some of
these details are due, says that he stood back as though
expecting them to pass.</p>

<p>Then some woman's voice shouted: "There 'e is, the bloody
furriner," and some one raised a lantern. In this flickering
light Husky recognised one or two faces that meant trouble.</p>

<p>He whispered: "I'd go back inside, guvnor, for a bit, I
would," and was, I've no doubt, considerably tempted to go back
himself, but the thought of the corpse, maybe, kept him where he
was. Then one of the witches came to the door and screeched out:
"She's gone. Carrie Furkins' gone!" and then some man from the
stairs shouted back:</p>

<p>"Then 'e's murdered 'er, that's what 'e's done. Throw 'im into
the river."</p>

<p>So far young Husky is clear. After that there is much
confusion. It must have been at the sound of those cries that
Johanson realised at last that he was in the hands of his enemies
and that his enemies intended mischief.</p>

<p>From what he said to Longstaffe I believe that, until this
moment, he fancied that that fight of his had won him favour with
the Seatown ruffians. And so it might have done had it not been
for Hogg and others, who had for months been working behind his
back. But I believe that it was honestly now for the first time
that he realised that these men really hated him and meant to
hurt him if they could.</p>

<p>He stood without moving at the turn of the stairs and spoke to
them. He asked them what the matter was, what they had against
him.</p>

<p>At that there was a kind of rush up the stairs at him. Men
pushed from below, there was a great deal of shouting, men's and
women's voices confused. The lantern vanished and everything was
dim and half seen.</p>

<p>Several men made for him at once. He tried to hold them off
from him, but one of them fell backwards down the stairs and
dragged Johanson with him. At that the brutal mob-instinct was
roused, and tumbling, cursing, hitting out blindly, shouting,
they were all pell-mell together.</p>

<p>There was a sort of struggle in the passage and then they were
out through the door into the street. Here, under the starlight
and the moon, everything was clearer and there are several
witnesses to what followed.</p>

<p>He was seen to rise from his knees and with a great lift of
his shoulders and arms thrust several men from him. For a moment
he stood clear, and if then he had turned and run I have no doubt
but that he could have escaped. He was pretty sorely hurt by
then. One cheek was bleeding severely, his coat and waistcoat
were gone and his shirt was nearly off his back. He was angry
now, breathing hard, his head back and his eyes, one woman said,
"all fiery." In any case he was in a rage and he caught one man
who went for him a blow that landed him gasping up against the
wall. Then they were on him again, four, five, six of them. The
struggle was quite silent now, only muttering and curses. Slowly
he sank down, disappeared, then was up again, was raised for a
moment above them all. His face was now bleeding in many places.
Then some one threw a stone, which hit him on the side of the
head. Once more they were all around him; they were moving him to
the river wall. He seemed to be struggling very feebly. In the
dim light it was all shadowy, not men but ghosts of men and all
working in silence.</p>

<p>They were raising him slowly, and just as his body touched the
top of the wall he made another struggle but weakly, his head
moving aimlessly from side to side as though he did not know what
he was doing. The narrator of this part of the struggle could see
then that he was almost naked, but his trousers were all about
his feet, so that he was trussed in them helplessly.</p>

<p>He was above the wall, men striking at his body, some figure
leaping up at him like a maniac and trying to tear at his
hair.</p>

<p>For an instant of time he appeared in the starlight as though
he were standing on the river wall.</p>

<p>His knees were bent but otherwise he seemed to be standing
there quite naked and gigantic: this observer said that he was
clear in the starlight for a moment, his arms moving, his bare
chest heaving, his thighs rising as though against a gigantic
weight. He raised his hand, he cried something, and there must
have been something triumphant in his cry because afterwards it
was said by several that he shouted victoriously as though he had
beaten the lot.</p>

<p>Then he vanished back into the rushing stream of water.</p>

<p>A woman burst out screaming, and the shadows vanished like
smoke.</p>

<h1><a name="c306">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>

<h1>MISS MIDGELEY REVISITS . . .</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>I have been asked to give, with what circumstantial detail I
can, an account of a day spent by me in Polchester in the month
of October 1913.</p>

<p>I am very glad indeed to do this, just as I have been only too
glad to offer certain extracts from my journals.</p>

<p>Well, to begin my little narrative. Late in the month of
September of that year, 1913, I went down to Drymouth to stay
there with a woman friend. I had been working all through the
summer in London at a book for whose progress the use of the
British Museum was essential. Any one who has been compelled to
use that reading-room through the summer months, day after day,
will sympathise with the condition of fatigue and
brain-exhaustion in which by the middle of September I found
myself.</p>

<p>When, therefore, this chance of a holiday in the south of
England presented itself I eagerly snatched at it. I had left
Polchester shortly after Johanson's death in 1907 and I had never
returned. One of my intentions now was to make a journey over to
Polchester one day from Drymouth and see how the old place
looked.</p>

<p>This intention was doubly strengthened when I read one morning
the following in <i>The Western Morning News:</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">A POLCHESTER CELEBRATION</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On October 7 will be formally opened by the Mayor of
Polchester the new street of houses facing the Pol.</p>

<p>This street is to be known as Riverside Street, and it
promises to be one of the finest streets in Glebeshire, bordered,
as it is, by the waters of the Pol and faced by a beautiful bank
of rising fields and woods.</p>

<p>For many Polcastrians October 7 will be a significant day.
Formerly the site now occupied by the new street was covered with
one of the worst slums in Great Britain, long felt by the
citizens of Polchester to be a scandal utterly unworthy of this
Cathedral city's great traditions.</p>

<p>Many efforts were made to rid the town of this eyesore, but no
effective steps were taken until a shameful riot on October
<i>7,</i> 1907, opened the eyes of every one to the urgency of
the matter. It is felt, therefore, that the civic ceremony could
not take place more fittingly than on October 7, just six years
after the original disturbance.</p>

<p>The civic ceremony, which will take place at ten-thirty in the
morning, will be followed by a service at the Cathedral, at which
it is hoped that all the Cathedral dignitaries will be present.
This will be succeeded by a luncheon in the Town Hall.</p>

<p>After the formal opening of the new street by the Mayor, a
tablet to the memory of a foreign resident of the town who lost
his life in the riot of 1907 will be unveiled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Here was exciting news for me! Then Harmer John had come into
his own at last!</p>

<p>My friend saw that I was moved beyond my usual habit and
enquired the reason. I may say that it is not often that anything
in this amazingly unoriginal world can excite me. I told her no
more than that on October 6 I would pay a visit to Polchester,
returning by evening train on October 7. She offered to accompany
me, and I told her I would see her to Paradise first. No, this
little trip I must accomplish alone.</p>

<p>It was at first my idea that I would sleep that night of
October 6 under the roof of my old friend Mrs. Penethen, with
whom at irregular intervals during these years I had
corresponded. But, considering the matter further, I decided that
"The Three Feathers" should have the honour of offering me a bed.
Old friends not seen in the flesh for six years are apt to be
unexpectedly difficult. You try to pick up the old threads and
behold! they were snapped long ago!</p>

<p>Nor am I now, in my selfish old age, very easy for anybody,
nor, what is more, do I wish to be. I have spent years of my life
in trying to be pleasant to unagreeable people and I cannot see,
on looking back, that the results at all justified the
efforts.</p>

<p>No, I could see Mrs. Penethen and myself sitting one on either
side of that vast kitchen fire-place staring at one another and
twisting our brains for suitable subjects of conversation.
Horrible. The indifferent silence of "The Three Feathers"
infinitely preferable.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of October 6 I packed my little bag and took
my place in the slow train that through the long hours would,
unless for some mysterious reason it changed its dull mind, drag
its length across the flats of north Glebeshire.</p>

<p>My last flatterer! Is it unnatural that I should cherish his
memory? How many times during these years in London, when life
has seemed so dry and sterile, have I longed for him to burst in
with his enthusiasm, his eagerness, his hope! Just to see him sit
down at the table and deliver to me his latest idea, and then to
see him wait for my reply, so eagerly, so confidently, so certain
that it must be true what I say; and, in face of that eagerness
and confidence, how often did I examine my little stock and feel
almost shy of producing such shabby goods. But not shabby to him!
Nothing was shabby to him. Bad or good, yes, but everything
radiant with a bright, fresh colour, as though the sun had risen
on this old world for the first time yesterday.</p>

<p>It was raining at Polchester when, at last, my train consented
to arrive. Safe in "The Three Feathers" I was quite excited to
see once again in the hotel lounge the wall-paper with the yellow
chrysanthemums, the copy of Frith's "Railway Station" and the
large, red vases with the everlastings. The same waiter, too,
with the thin, pale face, the red nose and the stammer--and then
from some mysterious, magical distance the sounding through all
the fortresses of wall-paper of the Cathedral chimes, so that I
could see as I bent over the flickering fire the tall High Street
shining under the lamps in the rain, the dark dignity of the
Arden Gate, the heavy mass of the Cathedral walls. I had a book
with me, I remember, that was just the thing for my mood, Zack's
<i>On Trial,</i> a magical thing, the kind of book that I should
have liked to write had I genius, throbbing in every page with
just that same passion for creating beauty that was also Harmer
John's. And as I went up to bed and heard the rain hissing on the
panes and saw the stuffed birds under their glass, and caught the
faint click of the billiard balls from the floor below me, I
seemed, for a moment, to revive the thirst for life that old age,
disappointment in my fellow human beings, and the reading-room of
the British Museum had almost robbed me of.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather was lovely, a blue sky without
stain and a nice smell made of burning autumn leaves below my
window, rashers of bacon coming up to meet me in the hall and the
naked shiveriness of the oilcloth on the stairs.</p>

<p>I was told by my friend the waiter that every one would be at
the opening, and that I must go early if I wanted a good place,
so at ten o'clock down the hill I went.</p>

<p>Most of the town went with me, and, as it seemed to me, a
gayer, happier crowd than it would have been in the old days. It
was, perhaps, the brightness of the day. In any case the old town
was very much alive.</p>

<p>And so I reached the new street. And what did I think of it?
Well, it was hideously ugly, so ugly that, at my first sight of
it, had I been younger and more open to illusions I should have
turned my head aside and cried. Heavens! This was what my Harmer
John had made, he with his dream of avenues and statues and noble
buildings with fountains playing! Yes, hideous--but I am sure,
after all, a vast improvement on that terrible old Seatown slum.
No slum here any more. The neat, sober houses each dressed in
that dull, grey stone that is my especial detestation, each with
his two windows decorated with nice overhanging slate eyebrows,
each with his grey ears pricking up to heaven so neatly in their
appropriate places. Oh! the ugliness of that street! But there
was a fine, smooth road in front of the little houses, a mild,
grey stone wall and the river Pol beyond--that last, at least, as
it had ever been.</p>

<p>All so clean, so neat and comfortable. Every little house with
its bath (h. and c.) and its excellent sanitary arrangement, a
little garden back and front to every house. No slums any more
and no old inhabitants of the slums either. Whither had they all
fled, those ghosts of the sinister past? Hiding in the caves of
the sea and the hollows of the Glebeshire valleys? Or all
reformed with clean faces and clean collars, forming part of this
handsome crowd that pressed in on every side?</p>

<p>No time for more speculation. On a platform in front of us (we
were all packed together at the street end), behind a table
covered with a red cloth, stood the dignitaries of the town. I
recognised some of them. Why, cheery Mildmay, the auctioneer, was
mayor, and very happy in his handsome robes he looked, and there,
on either side of him, a little aged but only a little, were
Mortimer Shandon and Ben Eagle, Cassidy, gigantic Carlyon and
Massing of the Post Office. No sign anywhere of my old friend Mr.
Hogg.</p>

<p>Some of the Cathedral folk also. Pretty Lady St. Leath with
her stout, amiable husband, Mrs. Sampson, Mrs. Ryle and, of
course, my adored Mrs. Bond. How amusing to see them all again!
To see them still here, leading apparently the same lives, busied
in the same interests, while I had been lost in that London
turmoil, forgetting their very existence.</p>

<p>Whether it was in some fashion like coming home again, I don't
know, but they appeared to me a kindly-faced, generous-minded
little group--I liked to fancy--so sentimental was I at the
moment--that some of this was Harmer John's doing.</p>

<p>So sentimental was I that I thought quite highly of old
Mildmay's speech. I don't remember now a word of what he said,
but I can see him still in my eye all flushed and cheerful,
taking every bit of the work upon himself, quite complacent about
everything. So were we all. Myself was complacent. I stamped the
ground with my umbrella, shouted "Hear! Hear!" with the rest, and
congratulated myself most warmly for this fine improvement in our
dear old town.</p>

<p>The sun was now shining fully upon the row of self-conscious
houses, and that was an excellent thing, because we could not see
them without hurting our eyes, and so did not look at them, and
so were able to shout "Hear! Hear!" more convincingly than
ever.</p>

<p>Then it was all over, and, in a great surging mass, we moved
up the street.</p>

<p>I was lucky in this, that having been on the outskirts of the
first ceremony I was one of the earliest to move up the street
for the second.</p>

<p>This second ceremony was, of course, the unveiling of the
tablet to Harmer John. There we all stood in the broad space just
in front of the house where, during the last months of his life,
he had lived, staring at that beautiful view that he had so
greatly loved.</p>

<p>Staring also at his fountain. There it was, I very close to
it, kept from it only by some railings, looking so brave and
handsome and noble in the sun, the dark, friendly tree standing
over it, the old grey wall behind it. And on the grey wall was a
little brass tablet, covered at present by a white cloth. By this
time I was, let me at once confess it, very considerably
excited--excited as I had never been in all the last six years.
And how delightfully was my excitement increased when I found
that Lady St. Leath was to perform here the ceremony!</p>

<p>She came, smiling so prettily, into the enclosure, stood under
the tree, and then facing so, blushing a little, made a speech.
It was a very small one, but most honest and sincere. What she
said was that she had scarcely known Hjalmar Johanson, and that
she regretted now, as many others do, that she had not. She said
that he was a real lover of their town, and that his only thought
had been to serve it, but that, by many people, he had not been
understood.</p>

<p>They were all ashamed now of their mistake, and because they
were ashamed they had subscribed together (and she would like to
say that subscriptions had come in from all parts of the town)
and put up this tablet. She pulled a string and the simple record
stood there:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">HJALMAR JOHANSON,</p>

<p align="CENTER">FRIEND OF THIS TOWN,</p>

<p align="CENTER">DIED OCTOBER VII. MCMVII.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Every one clapped and Mr. Cassidy made a sentimental speech,
to which I did not listen.</p>

<p>Every one moved up the hill to the Cathedral service. I stayed
there a while quietly by myself.</p>

<p>I went later to pay my call on my old friend Mrs. Penethen. I
found her alone, in the old kitchen, and very much the same as
six years before I had left her. She was surprised, of course, to
see me, and pleased, I think--pleased if I did not stay too
long.</p>

<p>I sat down and we talked very happily together for an hour or
so.</p>

<p>She had not gone down to the ceremony, she said. I gathered
that she found this new Johanson legend pretty absurd. They were
as false now about him, she implied, as they had been before when
they threw stones at him. She said, however, very little about
him--one interesting thing, though, in connection with Maude. I
asked, of course, very soon about that young woman. Mrs. Penethen
replied drily that she was as well as could be expected. Was she
happy? No, she was not, and never would be. But she ruled her
husband, I gathered, with complete severity. Mrs. Penethen also
told me that after her marriage she had fought a ferocious battle
with the mother-in-law, fought it and won. Mrs. Boultewood,
senior, had retired to Buquay, where she sat in a lodging-house
and counted her money.</p>

<p>Had Maude, I ventured to enquire, quite forgotten Johanson?
Forgotten him? No. Indeed, she had not. She had the maddest idea:
she thought that he was not dead.</p>

<p>"Not dead!" I cried. "But that's lunacy." Yes, it was lunacy,
Mrs. Penethen agreed, but lunacy or no that was Maude's idea.</p>

<p>Absurd beyond anything, I continued, because if ever in the
world any one lived who would show himself and return to those he
loved it was Johanson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Penethen agreed entirely. It was all silly foolishness,
but many besides Maude had the same idea--ignorant people, of
course. There were stories. He had been seen in the woods above
Orange Street, on Parmiter's Field, he had haunted the
disappearing ruins of the old Seatown. "Always laughing, always
jolly, they say he is. I wouldn't think," continued Mrs.
Penethen, "anything at all about it if it didn't disturb Maude
so. But the girl's always thinking about it, expecting him to
turn up one day."</p>

<p>No, the body had never been found. That was why his death
could not be brought home to any individual. The scandal,
however, had been terrific (as I could myself remember) and Hogg
had been forced to leave the place. No one had intended, of
course, that the attack on Johanson should go as far as it did,
but that was the way of these things. You couldn't tell where
they would end.</p>

<p>Canon Ronder's reputation, Mrs. Penethen told me, had suffered
greatly in the affair. He had done nothing wrong exactly, but
that he should have mixed at all in such company was considered
very damaging. He took now a less prominent part in the town's
life. He had grown extremely stout. There was talk of his
retiring to a country living.</p>

<p>So passed a very pleasant hour. We had, each of us, our
memories, and these we mutually respected. She was relieved, I
think, when having invited me to share her mid-day meal I
refused, saying that I had some sandwiches with me, and on this
lovely day intended to sun myself on the hill. So we parted with
friendly feelings and guilty of no indiscretions afterwards to be
regretted.</p>

<p>And going down the street whom should I encounter but Judy
Penethen? Aged greatly, growing strangely like her mother, dark,
reserved, kindly. It was hard for me, as I stood there exchanging
commonplaces with her, to believe in that day when she had stood
there in my room telling me that she loved Johanson.</p>

<p>It had been so, nevertheless, and although she did not mention
him, yet, strangely, in her quiet demeanour, I felt a deep, deep
reserved force still of passionate feeling. Of the four women in
that house who each in her own way cared for that man, Judy had
been the one who truly loved him, who would always love him, I
did not doubt, for the remainder of her repressed, reserved
life.</p>

<p>It was her slim, stern figure that, more than any other, I
have in these later days remembered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, once up in the woods above the town, sitting on
a bank under a canopy of gold and amber leaves, feeling the sun
beat warm upon me, I soon forgot Judy.</p>

<p>I forgot everything and every one save Harmer John! I thought
of him with eager longing. Could I but see him for a moment again
and tell him that, through all these years, I had not forgotten
him!</p>

<p>Was he perchance somewhere about his beloved town on this day
when every one was praising him? or, like Arnold's gipsy:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,<br>
 Where at her open door the housewife darns,<br>
 Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate<br>
 To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.<br>
 Children, who early range these slopes and late<br>
 For cresses from the rills,<br>
 Have known thee eyeing, all an April day,<br>
 The springing pastures and the feeding kine;<br>
 And marked thee, when the stars come out and shine,<br>
 Through the long dewy grass move slow away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>I repeated the beloved words to myself, nibbling also at my
sandwiches. The blue intensity of the sky and the thick gold of
the autumn wood, the still crystal air and the beauty of the so
familiar poetry, brought me an exquisite mood of silence and
tranquillity.</p>

<p>I sat there, without moving, as it were in a state of happy
trance. Then--was it sleep, was it fancy, how shall I ever know
and who will there be ever to tell me?--did the leaves part, the
branches spring aside and a face, so familiar, so gay, glance
through at me! Did I, for a moment of time, see him head to foot,
strong and happy as he used to be, there between the branches
smiling at me with all his old humour and friendliness?</p>

<p>I called out "Harmer John! Harmer John!"</p>

<p>Of course there was no answer. The sun was in my eyes. I had
been asleep perhaps, or my desire for him had created him for an
instant before my eyes.</p>

<p>And yet I feel, to this very day, as though I had seen him
once more. I seem to remember that his face was older, thinner,
stiffer than it used to be, that the sleeve of his coat was brown
and ragged. How should I know these things?</p>

<p>I brushed the crumbs from my dress, burned the paper that had
held my sandwiches (How I detest the untidy, messy ways of the
modern generation!) and set off on the path down to
Polchester.</p>
