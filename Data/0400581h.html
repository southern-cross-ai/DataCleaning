<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnIntroduction"></a>An Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Do you remember that bad  lad called Blinky Bill? Yes? I thought you would. Well, just listen to the news  I have to tell you. He has escaped from the zoo! Yes, escaped! He is back in  the bush again. More exciting still, his mother is there too, and a little girl  koala called Nutsy, who Blinky says is his girl friend. You can imagine how  bold he is when he talks like that. I really think he has become fifty times  worse since he lived at the zoo. I suppose it is the environment. All those  cheeky monkeys, next door to him, and all kinds of little boys passing cheekier  remarks as they discussed the animals in the zoo. No wonder the poor child has  grown so bold. And less wonder that Mrs. Koala has two deep wrinkles on her  forehead, and an even more surprised look than usual on her face. She told me  in confidence that she&rsquo;s surprised at <i>nothing</i> nowadays. So you can imagine what sort of a time <i>she&rsquo;s</i> been having. Splodge, a gentleman of the bush, a kangaroo  also in captivity at the zoo, proved himself a loyal friend by helping the  koalas to escape&mdash;while he also did the vanishing trick. Peanuts, were the cause  of it all. When I tell you how it all happened I know you&rsquo;ll clap your hands  and say &ldquo;Good old Splodge&rdquo;. He told me the news himself. So I know it&rsquo;s perfectly  true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.W.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 1<br>
The Escape</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page007.jpg" alt="one" width="500" height="256"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bold little wretches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge the largest  kangaroo in the zoo lay on his side, eyes tightly shut, teeth grinding with  anger, and his tummy fairly boiling with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could spit  like the llamas next door.&rdquo; &hellip; Bang! Another peanut hit him right on the nose. &ldquo;That  makes the tenth!&rdquo; Splodge mumbled opening one eye just the tiniest bit to have  a look at his tormentors. &ldquo;Wait till the next arrives! I&rsquo;ll give that kid with  the freckles on his face the biggest fright he&rsquo;s ever had in his life. As for  that old woman with the umbrella&mdash;she&rsquo;ll jump sky-high. I had to move from my  favourite corner because she insisted on poking me with her gamp just to see me  jump. <i>Now</i>, I&rsquo;ll see who jumps the  highest.&rdquo; Closing his eye again he waited tensely for the moment of battle, listening  with ears pricked to the conversation of the freckled boy and his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You watch me plant one  on his tummy!&rdquo; freckle-face laughed as he took aim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you watch me pepper  his nose,&rdquo; his companion shouted as he dived into the bag of peanuts for  ammunition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What funny boys you  are!&rdquo; the old lady giggled watching the performance with great amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she goes!&rdquo;  freckle-face shouted as he threw a peanut straight at Splodge&rsquo;s tummy.</p>
<p>Whack! It hit and bounced  right off again. Instantly a wild fury came hurtling through the air, over the  fence, and plop!&mdash;right on top of the old lady, knocking her down amid shrieks  and high-pitched screams of terror. She hadn&rsquo;t a chance to jump. In a flash  Splodge went bounding down the path. The boys, too overcome with surprise and  scarcely realizing what had happened, just stood and stared in amazement. The whole  zoo became electrified. Lions roared, monkeys screeched, parrots chattered, the  macaws cawed, the kookaburras laughed, and amidst all the noise and confusion  keepers came racing down the path to find out what it was all about. Splodge,  being a cunning kangaroo, knew this was the opportunity to hide. He made  straight for the fence where the undergrowth lay thickest, and, as dusk was  falling, it was quite an easy matter to take cover.</p>
<p>Thump! Thump! Thump! He  bounded in great leaps, getting nearer and nearer his objective. Round the  koala&rsquo;s compound he came like lightning, just catching a glimpse of the little  bears out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! You! Where are you  off to? Kicking up the dust like an elephant in a fit!&rdquo; This cheeky voice came  from a koala. You can guess who.</p>
<p>Splodge hesitated a  second, then started to hop away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Hi! Can&rsquo;t you spare  a moment? I won&rsquo;t eat you!&rdquo; the cheeky voice called again. &ldquo;Come back! I&rsquo;ve got  something most important to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge put his back  pedal on, and came to a standstill, nervously glancing all round him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake keep  quiet,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m escaping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; the cheeky  bear asked excitedly, climbing nearer the wire fence that divided him from  Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo;  Splodge replied coldly. &ldquo;Anyhow, what do you mean by stopping me? You can see I&rsquo;m  in a desperate hurry. Why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t even know your name, let alone recognize you.  For all I know you might be a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m Blinky  Bill, Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s only son. And what&rsquo;s more I&rsquo;m going to escape too&mdash;seeing  that a great big animal like you can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> be quiet! Hold your tongue!&rdquo; Splodge growled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the keepers  down here in a minute if you make such a noise. Can&rsquo;t you whisper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can, only  don&rsquo;t go&mdash;please don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Blinky pleaded. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help me to escape too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> me!&rdquo; a voice whispered so softly that it could hardly be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! Why did I  stop?&rdquo; Splodge growled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a fellow escape from zoos and peanuts without  having to take the raggle-taggle with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raggle-taggle! Indeed!  Do you know I&rsquo;m Mrs. Koala, and come from the same bush as you?&rdquo; She squeezed  her nose against the wire enclosure and looked angrily at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all  interested,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve no more time to waste. If you had a tail you  might have escaped long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monkeys have tails  and <i>they</i> don&rsquo;t escape,&rdquo; Blinky  replied quickly. &ldquo;It must be your brains that helped you. You must be a very clever  animal, in fact the cleverest animal in the zoo, because you&rsquo;re the only one  that&rsquo;s escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piffle!&rdquo; Splodge said  with a sly look at Blinky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s peanuts and umbrellas that did it; but I&rsquo;m not  denying that I didn&rsquo;t use what brains I have&hellip; Now you&rsquo;ve mentioned the matter,  I really believe it was my brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge licked a paw to  hide his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course it&rsquo;s your  brains!&rdquo; Blinky replied immediately. &ldquo;And, if they were extra special brains  they&rsquo;d get to work and think out a way of helping mother and me to escape. But  of course, they couldn&rsquo;t do that. They&rsquo;re only kangaroo brains after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ump!&rdquo; Splodge grunted. &ldquo;Well,  just to show you what excellent brains I have, I&rsquo;ll find a hiding-place until  dark, then, when I&rsquo;m alone I&rsquo;ll think out a way for you to escape; then I&rsquo;ll  come back and tell you&mdash;only, mind, it&rsquo;s to be kept a strict secret. If you dare  to breathe a word to any one about it I&rsquo;ll leave you to your fate and jump the fence  to freedom without even so much as looking your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the most  dreadful thing Splodge could think of at the moment to enforce quietness on his  young friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t breathe until  you come back,&rdquo; Blinky replied, his eyes wide open in excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you&rsquo;ll  die,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala interrupted rather tersely. &ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t want dead bodies  around here. At least, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She snapped her little jaws together and  folded her paws across her tummy, just to show the whole world what she really  thought of the position.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page011.jpg" alt="die" width="527" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get off your  bike: I&rsquo;ll pick up your pump!&rdquo; Blinky retorted cheekily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never escape if  you are going to be haughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bike!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said  coldly, raising her eyebrows. &ldquo;Where did you hear that word? Another dreadful  expression you&rsquo;ve picked up since we&rsquo;ve been at the zoo, and for all I know it  might be a naughty word.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy my son calling me  a-a-bike!&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Splodge  interrupted quickly. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say any such thing. I&rsquo;d give half my tail at  the present moment if I could get hold of a bike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; Blinky  whispered. &ldquo;Hurry, for goodness&rsquo; sake. Here comes a keeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he hasn&rsquo;t heard  us,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala whispered with fright. &ldquo;Dear, dear, how dreadful! Hide  yourself, Mr. Kangaroo, as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Kangaroo needed  no advice. He was gone like a flash, and as silently as a mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves me right for  stopping to gossip,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself. &ldquo;Those keepers never can mind their  own business. My goodness! Where&rsquo;s that fence? If I don&rsquo;t find it in a moment I&rsquo;ll  be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panting with excitement  and fright he stopped for a second to look around. With a peculiar little grunt  of satisfaction he noticed the fence showing above the undergrowth only a few  yards away. Working his way through lantana bushes he sought the thickest  cover, then flopped down on the earth to await results. It was dark by now, so  it just needed a little patience on his part to escape the searching keeper. Splodge  heard him running down the pathway, then for a few breathless minutes saw him  peering into the lantana bushes, carefully pulling aside a few branches and  stooping to gaze underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty sharp fellow!&rdquo;  he grumbled to himself. &ldquo;Getting away like that, right under my very nose. He  can stay there till daylight, because I&rsquo;m not hunting around in these  snake-holes for all the kangaroos in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good shot!&rdquo; Splodge  whispered. &ldquo;That just suits me nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper gave the  lantana bushes a savage kick with his boot to show the contempt he had for that  rubbish, then quickly disappeared the way he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo;  whispered Blinky to his mother as the keeper hurried past the bears&rsquo; compound, &ldquo;and  he hasn&rsquo;t caught Mr. Kangaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been surprised  if he had!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala exclaimed with satisfaction. &ldquo;That proves what I&rsquo;ve  always said to you in the past. A bush animal is a very clever being once he  gets among the cover. Keep quiet, don&rsquo;t clatter about like humans do, and you&rsquo;ll  elude them nearly every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the fuss  about? You two seem to have a great deal to say to one another.&rdquo; A most  inquisitive looking old lady bear eyed Mrs. Koala with suspicion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not  plotting are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! We&rsquo;re just minding  our own business,&rdquo; (Mrs. Koala glared at the intruder as she snapped out her  reply), &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d give all I possess for sixpenneth of privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d give the same,&rdquo;  her neighbour remarked angrily. &ldquo;Ever since you came here with that son of  yours, we older bears have had no peace. Why only this morning I was preparing  to have my doze and had picked a beautiful branch in the sunlight, when that  impudent cub came along and broke a twig right under where I was going to sit.  A good thing for him I happened to hear it, otherwise I&rsquo;d have fallen to the  ground and injured myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indignant bear  waddled off, ruffled with annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>you</i> do that?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala gritted her  teeth as she looked at Blinky with a stony stare.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page013.jpg" alt="did" width="500" height="428"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I did!&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always giving me a nasty nip whenever I go near her, and bumping me if I  pass her on the tree. I wanted her to come a cropper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo;<i>A cropper!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Koala repeated the words slowly, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s a c-r-o-p-p-e-r?  It is any relation to a hopper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only it&rsquo;s upside  down,&rdquo; Blinky replied quickly. &ldquo;Instead of jumping up, you turn a somersault  and come down with a bump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala grabbed her  son by the scruff of his neck and shook her paw angrily in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you <i>ever</i> let me see or hear of you making  croppers. You bad cub! You dreadful child! I&rsquo;d no idea what terrible things  croppers were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave Blinky a good  shaking, making his teeth chatter until he hit back with a naughty kick from a  hind leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?  Didn&rsquo;t I say he&rsquo;s the worst bear in the zoo!&rdquo; This remark came from the old  bear who had been the cause of the argument. Mrs. Koala very wisely said  nothing in reply; but grabbing her son by an ear toddled off to the farthest  corner of the compound. There she sat deep in thought, one arm round Blinky  who, feeling thoroughly ashamed of himself, patted her nose every now and  again, just to show how sorry he really was. By now, all the other bears were  enjoying supper, nibbling at the gum-leaves and grunting with satisfaction, so  that when a large, dark form silently hopped up to the wire fence, no one saw  him except the two little bears who were waiting so anxiously for his  appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Blinky  whispered excitedly, poking his mother in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Keep  very quiet. He has seen us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I tell you and  ask no questions. Don&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; Splodge whispered through the wire. &ldquo;Stay  where you are, and when I jump the fence scramble on to my back as quickly as  possible. There are spies all around us, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Blinky  watched with their hearts pounding as though they would burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready! I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;  Splodge whispered, and at the same moment sprang right over the fence of the  compound and landed in the middle of the enclosure. He did it very silently and  cleverly; but the other koalas in the trees nearly fell from the branches with  surprise. Blinky and Mrs. Koala made a wild scramble up Splodge&rsquo;s back,  gripping his ears and fur, determined not to fall off and waste time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; Splodge  called out, &ldquo;and look out for a bump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Hi!&rdquo; Blinky cried  as he felt himself being hurled through the air. Then, plonk! down on the  ground Splodge landed, his little friends still gripping his fur for dear life.  Away he bounded, down the path, and into the lantana bushes again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poosh!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  over. Now for the big fence and away to freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in the compound  twenty or more little koalas sat blinking at one another in sheer astonishment.  They had nothing to say, as everything happened like a whirlwind and left them  stunned with surprise. Even the old lady bear could not believe her eyes, and  just sat and stared and stared.</p>
<p>Splodge lost no time in  looking about for a suitable place from which to make his big spring over the  zoo fence. Blinky too, was busy helping to find a suitable place for escape. He  scrambled about on his funny little legs, poking here and there and stumbling  over the undergrowth in his hurry. He never was happy on the ground. The tall  gum-trees were his element; he climbed those as easily as winking. Suddenly he  stopped, clawed a paling in the fence, then forced a paw behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; he  whispered to himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s loose, and Mr. Kangaroo can easily rip it down.&rdquo; He  hurried to Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly! Come here! I&rsquo;ve  found a way of escape,&rdquo; Blinky said.</p>
<p>He showed Splodge the  loose paling, and in a twinkling Splodge had his powerful claws at work,  ripping away that paling and the next, until a gap was made that with a tight  squeeze he could crawl through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for fences!&rdquo; he  exclaimed with a grin, while his pretty brown eyes danced with joy.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page015.jpg" alt="fences" width="636" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Mrs. Koala and Blinky  scrambled through with the greatest of ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free! Free!&rdquo; Splodge  cried happily. &ldquo;No more beastly peanuts and umbrellas; but the hills and the  trees to roam in for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very  well,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied quietly; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve got to get there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t fly,&rdquo;  Blinky interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the next best  thing to flying. Hop on my back as quickly as you like, and I&rsquo;ll do the rest,&rdquo;  Splodge laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you had brains, Mr.  Kangaroo,&rdquo; Blinky puffed as he scrambled up his friend&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Splodge!&rdquo;  that gentleman replied with a pleased look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nice name,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala panted as she finally squatted well up on her friend&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d  have company on my journey,&rdquo; Splodge remarked as he made a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a speedometer?&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala asked as they flew along at an incredible speed.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page017.jpg" alt="speedometer" width="522" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Not what you&rsquo;d strictly  call one,&rdquo; Splodge replied. &ldquo;But my tail tells me what speed I&rsquo;m travelling at.  Just now, it is over sixty miles an hour: it becomes slightly cold when I  exceed that limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh gracious!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  cried. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go sixty miles an hour. I think speeding&rsquo;s terribly  dangerous, especially when you&rsquo;re riding pillion and no brakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a frightful jerk  Splodge stopped dead. Mrs. Koala screamed, while Blinky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that for brakes?&rdquo;  Splodge inquired slowly, turning his head to take a look at his passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosker!&rdquo; Blinky cried,  while poor Mrs. Koala only gripped tighter than ever the clump of fur that  saved her from a nasty spill. She gulped slowly and turned very pale, but said  nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, off we go again!&rdquo;  Splodge called. &ldquo;Grip tightly, because I&rsquo;m going to make this trip a record. We  must reach the bush by daylight unless we want to be recaptured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not an easy  matter to go bounding through suburban streets with blinding motor-car lights  dazzling his sight, and evading curious policemen at street corners. But no  motor-car travelled as quickly as Splodge. If he&rsquo;d had a tail number-plate no  policeman could have seen it in time, as Splodge simply flashed along the  roads. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty miles were behind them in no time. As the  night drew on tall gum-trees, wattles and scrub took the place of paved roads  and houses. Deeper and deeper into the bush he pressed, slackening his speed only  when necessary to avoid a dead tree that straddled his pathway. These he took  with long graceful bounds, always to Blinky&rsquo;s delight and Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s terror.  They saw the trains in the distance rushing along like huge glow-worms, and  heard the shrill shriek of their whistles. But all had only one thought in  their minds, and that was to get as far into the bushland as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where we branch  off!&rdquo; Splodge cried, slackening his speed. He turned his head from side to  side, paused for an instant, stuck his nose out as far as possible, then took a  long deep sniff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re near the mountains,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I can smell the  mist and creeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala began to  whimper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us far, far away  in them,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Take us back to our old home. Take us away from men and  zoos, and where I can make Blinky a good boy again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please Mr. Splodge  take me where there are slippery gum-trees, the ones all smooth with no  branches sticking out for a long way up, so&rsquo;s I can have slides down them in  the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do any such  thing!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala ordered, changing at once from her sweet kind mood into an  angry mother bear. &ldquo;The very idea! And in your good knickerbockers too!  Remember, my lad, I&rsquo;ll have no monkey tricks when we get home. Obedience is  what I&rsquo;ll have&mdash;or look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue on my back!&rdquo;  Splodge exclaimed. &ldquo;It makes me feel most uncomfortable when you two wriggle  and twist about like a couple of snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harmony reigned again,  and no further arguments took place. Splodge, travelling ever ahead into the  mountains, only stopped occasionally to drink at clear running streams.  Sometimes he dipped his nose in the water without drinking, just to feel the  delight of the clear cold stream, just to make sure once more that he was back  in the bush. Daylight was heralded by the laugh of the kookaburras and the  glorious notes of the magpies. All bird-land awoke with song in its heart. The inhabitants  of hundreds of trees and bushes set about the day&rsquo;s task of looking for food,  and what a joyous undertaking it was, judging by their song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes old Wombo!&rdquo;  Blinky cried clapping his paws with glee. &ldquo;Hullo! Old Wombo, we&rsquo;re back!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page019.jpg" alt="wombo" width="542" height="750"></h3>

<p>&ldquo;So I see. So I see.&rdquo; Mr.  Wombat stood by the side of the track he&rsquo;d made through the bush on his many  excursions when looking for roots and other delicacies to stock his larder  with. &ldquo;My cupboard&rsquo;s empty or I&rsquo;d ask you to breakfast with me,&rdquo; he said sadly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old and can&rsquo;t go far afield for my tucker nowadays; but I&rsquo;m glad  to see you back. Your home is just as you left it a year ago. Sometimes when I&rsquo;ve  seen strangers about I&rsquo;ve ordered them on to other parts, always hoping you&rsquo;d  come back some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> kind of you, Mr. Wombat.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s  eyes filled with tears. How dear everything was in the bush, and how wonderful  to be home again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be giving a tree-warming as soon as I have time to  settle down, and you must come along, Mr. Wombat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! don&rsquo;t miss that!&rdquo;  Blinky interrupted. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d brought you back some peanuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re my favourite  dish,&rdquo; Mr. Wombat said, licking his whiskers. &ldquo;Pity you didn&rsquo;t think of it. I  hear that a man&rsquo;s growing them over the next hill, and there&rsquo;s acres and acres  of them dying to be picked&mdash;but my old legs won&rsquo;t carry me there. I smell them  all right, and that makes me feel very sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The look of &rsquo;em makes  me sick!&rdquo; Splodge said crossly. He&rsquo;d listened with great patience to this  conversation, but could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> get you some peanuts,&rdquo; Blinky said as he looked at Mr. Wombat&rsquo;s  quivering whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re a good lad,  Blinky. I always did say you were not as bad as they made out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mr. Wombat shuffled  off along the track, poking his nose here and there, sniffing for something  that may have escaped his notice when last he was that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll <i>not</i> steal those peanuts!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said under her breath, as she grabbed her son&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to steal <i>one</i> of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; Blinky  said meekly. &ldquo;It was only the look of old Wombo&rsquo;s whiskers that made me say I  would. They twitched so quickly when I said I&rsquo;d get peanuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at them  again&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Here&rsquo;s  our home,&rdquo; she cried almost in the same breath. &ldquo;Look at it! Look at it! Just  the same dear old tree&mdash;and not a branch missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Splodge?  Where&rsquo;s he going to sleep?&rdquo; Blinky asked anxiously as he slid off his back and  ran to look up into Splodge&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you climb our tree?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. But  I have cousins who could,&rdquo; Splodge replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather camp on the ground at  the foot of the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here and  not hop away then?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying here for  the tree-warming&mdash;after that I can&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo; Splodge lay on his side idly  flicking his tail. &ldquo;What joy it is to be home again,&rdquo; his eyes said as they  roved all over his surroundings. Meanwhile, Mrs. Koala was making rather slow  progress up the tree, followed by Blinky. &ldquo;Move on, mother! You&rsquo;re as slow as a  snail,&rdquo; Blinky remarked as he climbed up behind his panting parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cheeky, and  don&rsquo;t ruffle me. I&rsquo;m out of practice since being at the zoo,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied. &ldquo;And I believe I&rsquo;ve put on weight as well.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page022.jpg" alt="cheeky" width="572" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re t-e-r-r-i-b-l-y  fat from here,&rdquo; Blinky remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do! Not another  word!&rdquo; his mother snapped, as she eventually came to rest on a branch high up  from the ground. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll curl up for a nap here,&rdquo; she said, settling down in the  comfy fork of the branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go  to sleep,&rdquo; Blinky protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! bother you&mdash;run away  and let me have forty winks. My patience is frayed.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala just nodded her  sleepy old head and fell into slumberland, too happy to worry over her naughty  son for once. Needless to say he took full advantage of this opportunity to  explore his old home&mdash;with the most startling results.</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As Blinky Bill climbed  higher up the tree his sharp little eyes noticed that gum-leaves had been  picked and chewed very recently from the nearest limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; he  murmured to himself. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been here stealing our supper. If it&rsquo;s old Mrs.  Grunty I&rsquo;ll have something very nasty to say to her. The cheek of her! Our very  own tree, and our very own leaves!&rdquo; He became quite angry the more he  discovered the loss of the leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we had a  policeman in this bush. For two pins I&rsquo;d turn policeman myself. Now I come to  think of it that&rsquo;s what I <i>will</i> do!&rdquo; Suddenly  a twig snapped. Blinky looked up like a flash; but there was no one to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of it, you  stealer!&rdquo; he shouted. Silence as deep as the sea greeted his command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of it or I&rsquo;ll  eat you to death!&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t do that! <i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t do that! I didn&rsquo;t mean to  steal leaves. I just wanted to taste them,&rdquo; a frightened little voice replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a girl?&rdquo; Blinky  roared, angrier than ever. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause if you are you&rsquo;ll be dead in a minute. I <i>hate</i> girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a girl. It&rsquo;s  only my dress that makes me look like one,&rdquo; the little voice replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show yourself at once!  Do you think a fellow can hunt round this tree for hours looking for robbers?&rdquo;  Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am&mdash;<i>please</i> don&rsquo;t eat me,&rdquo; and the sweetest  little girl koala poked her head around the tree not two yards away from where  Blinky stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum-n!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a girl. I can tell by the silly way you&rsquo;re looking at me; besides, you&rsquo;re too  clean for a proper boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a boy!&rdquo; the little  bear said defiantly, stamping a tiny foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do-you-wash-behind-your-EARS?&rdquo;  Blinky asked in a slow cold voice, trying to freeze his little visitor with a  glare that would have made any bear shudder.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page025.jpg" alt="wash" width="515" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo; the  little koala replied indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that settles it!  You&rsquo;re a girl. No proper boy washes behind his ears. Come out here while I take  you in charge! Don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m a policeman and this is <i>my</i> tree?&rdquo; Blinky advanced towards the little bear who stood too  frightened to move an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me, will  you?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about that  later on. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Blinky shouted, at the same time grabbing the  little bear by the ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Nutsy,&rdquo; she  cried, tears trickling down her funny little nose. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An <i>orphan!</i> What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Blinky demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no mother or  father,&rdquo; Nutsy wailed, &ldquo;and no brothers or sisters. There&rsquo;s only me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to be  locked up just the same, because the law says &lsquo;all animals, specially orphans,  mustn&rsquo;t steal&rsquo;.&rdquo; Blinky gave her ear a pull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it or I&rsquo;ll bite  you!&rdquo; Nutsy exclaimed, shrieking at the top of her voice.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page027b.jpg" alt="bite" width="375" height="316"></p>
<p>Mrs. Koala awoke, rubbed  her eyes and listened. &ldquo;What is that bad boy up to now?&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Blinky!  Come down here immediately.&rdquo; She called her son with a decidedly angry voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he replied,  shouting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found an orphan and she won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An orphan!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  repeated loudly. &ldquo;How did an orphan get in our tree? That&rsquo;s that old Mrs. Grunty!  She&rsquo;s been stealing our leaves, and cooking them&mdash;of all things. Well, she won&rsquo;t  get her orphan back. I&rsquo;ll keep it for the tree-warming. It&rsquo;ll be very useful to  make a cup of tea in. Bring it down to me, Blinky. Has it any holes in it? Are  they stuffed up with rag? Because if there are holes and rag I won&rsquo;t use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an <i>orphan</i>&mdash;not a saucepan,&rdquo; Blinky replied,  shouting loudly.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page027a.jpg" alt="orphan" width="480" height="418"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t a mother or  father,&rdquo; Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No orphans have,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied. &ldquo;Has it a handle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s got ears and  eyes and it bites,&rdquo; Blinky answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Hold it  until I come up and have a look,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala cried excitedly, scrambling up the  tree as fast as her old legs would go. &ldquo;Dear, dear,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;What a  strange thing an orphan is. I&rsquo;ve never seen one before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grunting and puffing she  reached the bough where Blinky and Nutsy stood. Taking one look at Nutsy she  raised her paws in surprise and delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> an orphan! What nonsense! Why, it&rsquo;s a little girl. The dear little  thing! Come here darling while I have a look at you. And tell old Mrs. Koala  your name.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page029.jpg" alt="orphan" width="504" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s under  arrest,&rdquo; Blinky roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever for?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  inquired. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s going to arrest her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> am!&rdquo; Blinky replied, throwing out his chest. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been stealing  our leaves, so I&rsquo;ve turned into a policeman and I&rsquo;m going to lock her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll box your ears if  you do any such thing,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said stoutly. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t talk rubbish to me.  A policeman indeed! You&rsquo;re my son. If there&rsquo;s any locking up to be done, I&rsquo;ll  do it and you&rsquo;ll be the first to taste it if you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! Aren&rsquo;t mothers  awful?&rdquo; Blinky sighed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even be a policeman but what she spoils it. Go  on, sweet little darling; go to the kind lady.&rdquo; These last words he addressed  to Nutsy, giving her a sly pinch as he pushed her forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her sorry  for being a girl,&rdquo; Blinky muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if this isn&rsquo;t a  surprise!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said, smiling all over her face, and gently taking Nutsy&rsquo;s  paw. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Mrs. Grunty be jealous? And I&rsquo;ve always wanted a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell stories,  mother!&rdquo; Blinky said angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always said you&rsquo;re glad I&rsquo;m a boy, and  you wouldn&rsquo;t have <i>ten</i> girls if they  were given you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me! I  must have had a bad headache when I said that,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;Here&mdash;Blinky,  help me to get this little girl down the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him&mdash;he  pinches.&rdquo; Nutsy drew nearer Mrs. Koala. &ldquo;And anyway I can climb up and down by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go down and have some supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; Blinky  said, staring at Nutsy with looks of contempt.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page030.jpg" alt="come" width="675" height="370"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my beat!&rdquo; Blinky  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down here and have  your supper or I&rsquo;ll be on the beat!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala ordered sternly. &ldquo;And put this  policeman business out of your head at once. The idea of living in a tree with  a policeman!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala mumbled away to herself. She was very annoyed.</p>
<p>Once down on the cosy  corner of the gum-tree that she liked so much her ruffled temper subsided. She  asked Nutsy where she came from and how she came to be in the tree. &ldquo;You must  have a mother and father somewhere, child,&rdquo; she said, patting Nutsy&rsquo;s soft  ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I just woke up one  day and found myself in this tree,&rdquo; Nutsy replied. And no further questions of Mrs.  Koala&rsquo;s produced a different answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, from now on,  you&rsquo;ll live with Blinky and me. I&rsquo;ll be delighted to have a little daughter, as  I&rsquo;ve been feeling lately I&rsquo;d like to twist a little girl&rsquo;s curls up every night  in gum-leaves. I can&rsquo;t do that with a boy&mdash;specially Blinky. There&rsquo;s no knowing  what he&rsquo;d do next if I started.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala heaved a big sigh of contentment.</p>
<p>Together the three bears  ate their supper, chattering and grunting with the pure joy of living. Out of  the corner of her eye Mrs. Koala noticed Blinky pass Nutsy several young juicy  leaves&mdash;not once, but on several occasions. Smiling to herself she wisely said  nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better write out  an invitation to the tree-warming,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said when they had finished  their meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask Mrs. Grunty,&rdquo;  Blinky said instantly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll spoil everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ignore her  like that. It would be so rude,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;But we needn&rsquo;t make a  fuss of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t kiss her  when she comes,&rdquo; Blinky said, looking very glum. &ldquo;When you kissed her, before  we went to the zoo, I always used to notice she thought that was the sign to  gobble up all the best leaves and give you bad advice about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of  that, let alone noticed it,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;She always had such a lot to  say that my head would become a whirlwind in no time&mdash;being a simple body.  However, let&rsquo;s get that invitation printed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; Blinky  exclaimed, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll stick it on the bottom of the tree.&rdquo; Later in the evening  three little bears stuck this notice up on the tree.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page031.jpg" alt="sign" width="450" height="521"></p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the P.C. for?&rdquo;  Splodge inquired as he gazed at the notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possum&rsquo;s Companion,&rdquo;  Blinky replied loudly. Then drawing Splodge aside whispered in his ear: &ldquo;It  means Police Constable. But don&rsquo;t you say a word to mother. She won&rsquo;t let me be  a butcher man or anything I want to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re to  have a P.C. because some of the kangaroos round here want sending about their  business. Hanging about gum-trees all night long and frightening respectable  lady wallabies out of their skins. It&rsquo;s a scandal!&rdquo; Splodge thumped his tail on  the ground. &ldquo;For a few bushels of peas, I&rsquo;d become a policeman myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Blinky  said crossly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only work for one policeman here, and I thought of it  first, so it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want the  job really,&rdquo; Splodge said, chewing a straw thoughtfully. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your work  cut out if you have to run Mrs. Snake in, or a couple of dozen of those Bull-jo  ants when they become obnoxious. And there&rsquo;s also the bees. I remember seeing a  whole colony drunk one day. Been stealing the sugar from Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s  home brew. How would you like to arrest <i>them</i> for disorderly conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That certainly made  Blinky think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make you my  assistant if you like,&rdquo; Blinky said condescendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do me!&rdquo; Splodge  replied, &ldquo;as long as I can do a bit of kicking when it&rsquo;s required. Now, I can  sign letters after my name. Mr. Splodge&mdash;Police Assistant. That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s far too long,&rdquo;  Blinky interrupted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sign yourself like this&rdquo;&mdash;picking up a twig he  scratched on the tree:</p>
<p>&nbsp;SPLODGE, ASS.</p>
<p>Splodge examined it  closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to be  rude or clever do you?&rdquo; he asked uncomfortably.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page033.jpg" alt="ass" width="517" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that&rsquo;s short for assistant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; Splodge  answered, still looking doubtfully at the signature. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m over  self-conscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking so much  and come and help me to prepare the tree-warming,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala interrupted. &ldquo;Talk  about women gossiping&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; Splodge  replied. &ldquo;Tell me what to do and I&rsquo;ll get to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a patch to be  cleared round the foot of the tree to start with,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala remarked, &ldquo;and  the supper to collect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the gum-nuts!&rdquo;  Nutsy said, half-way up the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blinky&mdash;you gather some  of the best leaves off the tree&mdash;only don&rsquo;t take the <i>very</i> best&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll see what I can collect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala padded away  through the bushes. Splodge set to work with a will. He scratched all the dead  leaves and rubbish away from the foot of the tree, and scraped the lichen off a  large flat rock with his sharp nails, preparing it for the table. He carried  small bunches of wild berries in his mouth, laying them across the table. Nutsy  threw from the branches overhead, dozens of gum-nuts, and Blinky sent down a  shower of leaves. Certainly not the <i>very</i> best, as some had clearly been well nibbled beforehand. Mrs. Koala returned,  delighted with her find: an armful of watercress. Blinky and Nutsy scuttled  down the tree to see the treasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  touch it!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala commanded. &ldquo;It will probably kill you if you eat it. You  know, as I&rsquo;ve often told you, only special gum-leaves are for koalas. This is  for Splodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page034.jpg" alt="work" width="488" height="400"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully!&rdquo;  Splodge said. &ldquo;Do you mind if I have a taste now?&rdquo; He licked his lips at the  very thought of that delicious meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather  you waited for the party,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;We want to make the food look  as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. Quite so,&rdquo;  Splodge replied, licking his lips all the more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think? I  met Mrs. Froggles down at the creek. She had her family of taddies with her,  and fine lads they are too!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala carefully spread her watercress on the  ground, giving Splodge a doubtful look at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask Mrs. Froggles  and the tads to the party, did you, mother?&rdquo; Blinky inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The dear thing&rsquo;s  coming. And how excited she was at the thought of it,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh bother! Now I&rsquo;ll  have to catch spiders and flies,&rdquo; Blinky growled, &ldquo;and I s&rsquo;pose the tads only  eat mossies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She&rsquo;s going to  bring her own flies,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala explained. &ldquo;I told her we usually threw any  flies or spiders away that we found on the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a special  gum-nut for you, Mrs. Koala,&rdquo; Nutsy said as she handed out an extra large nut  from her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such unselfishness I&rsquo;ve  never seen before,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said as she took the nut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I hate  about girls,&rdquo; Blinky whispered to Splodge. &ldquo;Always trying to be pets!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page035.jpg" alt="hte" width="500" height="367"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Men haven&rsquo;t time to  bother about that,&rdquo; Splodge replied&mdash;&ldquo;specially policemen. By the way, Blinky,  where&rsquo;s your baton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I have one? And  what is a baton?&rdquo; Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a piece of wood,  that dangles from your belt. All real policemen carry one. It&rsquo;s for banging  people on the head who don&rsquo;t behave.&rdquo; Splodge explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! I&rsquo;ll have to have  one,&rdquo; Blinky replied thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to your  assistant. He&rsquo;ll see to that!&rdquo; Splodge announced, bounding away into the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real fellar!&rdquo;  Blinky said to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come children, we&rsquo;ll  wait up in the tree until the guests arrive,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said as she placed the  last gum-leaf on the table. So up the tree they all climbed, and sat waiting  anxiously for the first visitor to appear. Who should it be but old Wombo!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night Wombo!&rdquo;  Blinky called out. &ldquo;Read the notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wombat being  near-sighted had to screw his old eyes right up against the notice to read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any peanuts?&rdquo;  he asked immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! But there are  gum-nuts!&rdquo; Nutsy called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And watercress!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Watercress!</i>&rdquo; Old Wombo sprang at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it alone! Leave  it alone!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala screamed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not supper time yet.&rdquo; But old Wombo  already had a mouthful of the luscious green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it back!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted. Mrs. Koala was already half-way down the tree to rescue her precious  dainty. &ldquo;How rude of you!&rdquo; she said angrily. &ldquo;Eating up our party before the  guests arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was to have  supper,&rdquo; old Wombo said in a surprised voice. &ldquo;And it was so nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well&mdash;as you&rsquo;re very  old I&rsquo;ll overlook it this time,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said kindly. &ldquo;But <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t eat any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny sort of a party,&rdquo; old Wombo growled to himself as he sat on the ground to wait.</p>
<p>The next visitor to  appear was Mrs. Wallaby. She carried a baby in her pouch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;re  back, Mrs. Koala,&rdquo; she said with a sweet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving a  tree-warming,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;Do stay and have some supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the news of  the great event had been flashed through the bush, and animals and birds  arrived in dozens&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Possum, several families of wallabies, the  kangaroos of course, flying foxes, rabbits, weasels, mice and bush rats,  kookaburras and willy wagtails. Away in a tree all by himself sat Mr. Owl,  looking at everything and every one in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect so many  friends,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we won&rsquo;t have enough to eat,  and I&rsquo;ve no grubs for the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all bring our  own!&rdquo; several birds called, and flew off to gather their supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m going to eat that watercress</i>,&rdquo; old Wombo growled to himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Splodge had  returned and fastened a knotty stick to Blinky&rsquo;s belt. &ldquo;Just to keep order in  case it&rsquo;s needed,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>When the supper  commenced, Nutsy helped Mrs. Koala by handing round the nuts. The guests were  at their gayest, calling and squeaking at the fun of it all. In the excitement  of chatter and hopping, no one noticed old Wombo silently gobbling all the  watercress round at the back of the tree. He munched with delight; then, when  he had finished, took a last look at the visitors, turned, and slowly ambled  home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the ants!&rdquo;  someone cried. Immediately there was confusion. &ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; they shouted.  Blinky grabbed his baton and rushed in the direction where all the guests  pointed.</p>
<p>Dozens and dozens, in  fact hundreds of ants stood on tiptoe, surveying the scene. Their antennae  waved with excitement as they thought of the grubs and flies that could easily  be theirs when they decided to advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! you fellows!&rdquo;  Blinky called out, swinging his baton, &ldquo;Get back to your dug-outs.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page038.jpg" alt="hey" width="480" height="379"></p>
<p>The ants took no notice  whatever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t-you-know-we&rsquo;ve-an-ant-eater-with-us?&rdquo;  he asked deliberately, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll eat you all in one swallow.&rdquo; As he delivered  this dreadful news he banged his baton down on the ground with a&mdash;crash!</p>
<p>Quicker than that every  ant had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scared them!&rdquo;  Blinky chuckled and walked back to the party, feeling very proud of himself;  but no sooner was he there than a piteous cry went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly! Quickly! He&rsquo;s  choking!&rdquo; Poor Mrs. Froggles was beside herself with fright. She hopped all  over the place, on the table, over the guests&rsquo; heads, and right into Mrs. Kangaroo&rsquo;s  pouch. All in mistake of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out! Get out!&rdquo; Mrs.  Kangaroo screamed, as she took a leap over Mr. Pelican&rsquo;s head. Out flopped Mrs.  Froggles, her eyes, that usually popped, now seemed to be almost out of her  head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save him! Save him!&rdquo;  she croaked louder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;  every one asked in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor child&mdash;my taddy&mdash;he&rsquo;s  choking. A grub&rsquo;s stuck in his throat,&rdquo; Mrs. Froggles croaked between hops.</p>
<p>Nutsy rushed to the  rescue. Grabbing Freddie Taddy who was black in the face, she turned him upside  down and shook him violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You greedy little  wriggler!&rdquo; she scolded, shaking all the harder.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page039.jpg" alt="greedy" width="494" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Thump him on the back!&rdquo;  someone called.</p>
<p>Nutsy did so, and out  popped a grub almost as large as Freddie Taddy himself, while he lay on the  ground gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw some water over  him,&rdquo; Mrs. Magpie advised. But there was no water near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him come to  life in a second,&rdquo; a nasty crawly voice remarked, &ldquo;or it&rsquo;s supper for me, and  no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a horrified cry  every one ran, for there lay Mr. Carpet Snake eyeing poor little Freddie with a  cruel look in his eyes. How <i>he</i> came  to the party unnoticed no one ever knew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Froggles gave one  ear-splitting croak and fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your baton out!&rdquo;  Splodge called to Blinky. Scarcely were the words out, when Blinky rushed to  the rescue. Waving his baton over his head and calling out at the top of his  voice, he made a vicious blow at Mr. Carpet Snake. He missed. A groan went up  from the excited spectators and all kinds of advice was shouted at him.</p>
<p>Mr. Snake reared his  head and prepared to spring. Mrs. Koala and Nutsy screamed. Blinky was ready to  strike again, when something came flashing through the air, struck Mr. Carpet  Snake on the head, and there stood Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a good kick!&rdquo;  he calmly remarked, as he looked at the body of the dead snake.</p>
<p>Every one rushed to  congratulate him, patted him on the back and nose, until Splodge reminded them  that poor little Freddie Taddy was still on the ground. He was saved and, after  some gentle stroking, soon recovered. Mrs. Froggles decided to go home at once,  as sixty children were too many to watch at one time. So calling her taddies to  her side, she ordered them to hop on her back and away she went, croaking  loudly.</p>
<p>The party ended by those  who were able to climb or fly inspecting the old gum-tree and wishing its  occupants the best of luck.</p>
<p>When all was silent, and  three little bears lay cuddled together in sweet sleep, an army of ants dined  on Mr. Carpet Snake. Such a supper they&rsquo;d not had for a long time. And, after  it, a constant stream of black and brown bodies carried little pieces of Mr. Snake  down to their home underneath the ground.</p>
<p>All day long the three  bears slept. Mrs. Koala snored a great deal; once she even woke herself up with  the noise. Turning to look at Blinky whom she was sure had made the noise, she  sighed and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little chap&mdash;he has  adenoids very badly. I&rsquo;ll have to see Dr. Owl about it.&rdquo; Then, snuggling down  again, she fell asleep once more.</p>
<p>At dusk, when the bears  were awake, and busily collecting their supper, Mrs. Grunty came along. She was  alone, having left Snubby, her son, at home; for &ldquo;Goodness knows what mischief  that bad boy Blinky will put in his mind after being in the zoo,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nice</i> goings on in the tree last night!&rdquo; she exclaimed, before she&rsquo;d  even said &ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; or any other polite greeting to her friend who had  been absent for so long.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page041.jpg" alt="nice" width="488" height="316"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how are you? I&rsquo;m  very pleased to see you again, Mrs. Grunty,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nice</i> goings on!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty repeated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have our bush talked about  next. In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear you were letting the gum-tree  out in flats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem all worked up,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala replied coldly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a widow bear give a tree-warming if she wants  to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such city notions!&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty scoffed. &ldquo;And I was not invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Every one</i> was invited,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you read the notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i> read the notice!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty sniffed. &ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d have time to  go round the bush reading notices. I was far too busy turning the heel of Snubby&rsquo;s  new winter socks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala said meekly. &ldquo;I know how busy children keep one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially one like you&rsquo;ve  got,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sorry for  saying that!&rdquo; Blinky exclaimed from behind the tree where he and Nutsy were  hiding. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always poking about and saying &lsquo;noxious, nauseous, nasty things.  And as for her Snubby&mdash;he&rsquo;s a <i>twink!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Nutsy  whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something awful and  dreadful,&rdquo; Blinky replied, while Nutsy looked at him in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shocking!&rdquo; she said  in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! and I&rsquo;ll be just  as pleased, Mrs. Koala, if you tell that Blinky of yours to keep away from our  tree.&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty flung these words at her friend as she prepared to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass me that stick!&rdquo;  Blinky ordered Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, madam!&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty said, just as Blinky poked the stick right in front of her feet. She  tripped, stumbled and fell, wildly clutching at a branch to save her fall, then  turning a somersault landed on the limb of the tree immediately below.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page042.jpg" alt="fell" width="503" height="650"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s come a cropper!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted at the top of his voice, while Mrs. Grunty roared with temper.  To make matters fifty times worse, Nutsy threw down a pawful of gum-nuts right  on top of Mrs. Grunty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the policeman  about this! I hear we&rsquo;ve got a policeman in the bush now! I&rsquo;ll have you  punished. I&rsquo;ll have you <i>exported!</i>&rdquo; Mrs.  Grunty shouted as she regained her feet and climbed down the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who threw those nuts?&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala demanded. &ldquo;And who made the cropper?&rdquo; She waggled her paw at the two  culprits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> made the cropper,&rdquo; Blinky said nudging Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>I</i> threw the nuts,&rdquo; his little companion  whispered, looking very ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice hotch-potch!&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala growled. &ldquo;All the same I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;perhaps she&rsquo;ll mind her own business  after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she will,&rdquo;  Nutsy said meekly, very relieved to find Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s temper had subsided so  quickly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Grunty growled all  the way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no peace  now!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to move. If I stay here my Snubby&rsquo;s  bound to get into trouble with that lad. My word! he&rsquo;s an outlaw.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully stale up  here,&rdquo; Blinky said one night, after just a week of being as good as an angel.  He and Nutsy were playing together while Mrs. Koala was holding a consultation  with Splodge at the bottom of the tree about starting a guest house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to  travel?&rdquo; Blinky whispered to Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Nutsy  replied, her eyes opening wide with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what does your  tummy say?&rdquo; Blinky asked. &ldquo;Does it jump when you think of it, or does it just  keep on being still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It jumps!&rdquo; Nutsy  exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you want to  travel,&rdquo; Blinky explained. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s best to do as it wants; &rsquo;cause if you don&rsquo;t  the jumps get bigger and bigger till they make you feel sick and want to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; Nutsy  said in a low voice. What a lot of things Blinky knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! it&rsquo;s best to do as  it wants,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And, as mine wants to go, I&rsquo;ll have to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your mother  say?&rdquo; Nutsy asked nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know till it&rsquo;s  all over,&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s, of course, if you don&rsquo;t tell her. If you do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  take you to old Wombo and tell him to put you in his dark muddy house, where  rats peep in at night just to see if any girls are in there who&rsquo;ve told tales.  If they find any, they eat them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never, never,  tell,&rdquo; Nutsy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not!&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll start right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Nutsy  objected. &ldquo;Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s at the foot of the tree talking to Splodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait a  while then,&rdquo; Blinky sighed. &ldquo;I&mdash;forgot all about mother. I wonder what she&rsquo;s  talking about. I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming too!&rdquo; Nutsy  said scrambling down the tree behind Blinky.</p>
<p>As they neared the  ground they could hear Mrs. Koala talking very confidentially to Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; they  heard her say. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be leading that dear little girl, Nutsy, into trouble too  if I don&rsquo;t do something to keep him employed. Apart from that, I find, now he&rsquo;s  a lad, his clothes are a big item and I&rsquo;ve very little to buy him new ones  with. Once upon a time I could cut his dear dead father&rsquo;s clothes down to fit  him. But they&rsquo;re all gone now. And the other animals all seem to have had  babies since I&rsquo;ve been away. Before, they gave me any clothes they&rsquo;d no need  for, now they have to use them themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Splodge remarked,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very hard. No doubt Blinky needs something to do to keep him out of  mischief. Have you any ideas, Mrs. Koala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of doing a  bit of crocheting; but Mrs. Rabbit advised me not to. She said no one wants  crochet work nowadays. They&rsquo;ve all gone mad on cross-stitch, and goodness only  knows I get cross enough at times, without sitting down and turning it into  doilies and mats,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; Blinky  murmured to Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ambitious, you  know, Mr. Splodge,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala continued. &ldquo;Since my visit to the zoo and seeing  with my own eyes the quantity of food the animals over there, <i>stuffed</i>, positively <i>stuffed</i> into themselves, especially the elephants and kangaroos&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; Splodge  exclaimed placing his paw behind one ear as if to hear better.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page046.jpg" alt="pardon" width="650" height="377"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean to be  rude,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala explained, &ldquo;or personal. I always noticed <i>you</i> never gobbled. In fact I thought  what a gentleman you were, compared to the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. Quite so,&rdquo;  Splodge returned. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s that got to do with your ideas, Mrs. Koala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this&mdash;as I was  saying, when I saw those animals eating so much, I thought some day if ever I  escaped from the zoo I&rsquo;d start a guest house! Now what do you think of that?&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala beamed all over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital idea!&rdquo; Splodge  announced. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll want a manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for instance, say  Mr. Fox came along and wanted board and residence for the night, and then tried  to steal silently away without paying&mdash;and he&rsquo;s a sly fellow, mark my words, a  sly, cunning fellow&mdash;what would you do then, Mrs. Koala?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge flung out his  paws in a hopeless gesture.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page047.jpg" alt="hands" width="493" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>would</i> be awkward. I never thought of that happening,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there are the  possums. I&rsquo;ve great regard for them, and I&rsquo;m not suggesting for one moment they&rsquo;d  do such a thing. But what if one got to your potato bin&mdash;and, mind you, I wouldn&rsquo;t  trust them for a second where potatoes are concerned&mdash;what would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Splodge flung out  his paws, and stared with a sorrowful look on his face, while poor Mrs. Koala  felt her hopes suddenly dashed to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; Splodge  continued, &ldquo;there are the rabbits to think of. You know me well enough, Mrs. Koala,  to realize I&rsquo;d think badly of no one; but &rsquo;pon my soul those rabbits need  watching with ten pairs of eyes. Just imagine&mdash;you having gone to all the  trouble of making a delicious watercress salad&rdquo;&mdash;(here Splodge licked his lips)&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Just imagine</i> your feelings if, when you  went to put it on the table, you found it had gone, that some sly,  quiet-stepping animal had actually pinched it while your back was turned. What  would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t hurt a  salad very much if it <i>was</i> pinched,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied. &ldquo;Only a few leaves bruised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have said <i>purloined</i>,&rdquo; Splodge returned. &ldquo;In other  words, <i>stolen</i>; but I&rsquo;m not saying the  rabbits would do such a dastardly thing, I&rsquo;m only s&rsquo;posing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would not  use such big words,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said in a meek voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a plain body  and it takes very little to start my headaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to  bamboozle you,&rdquo; Splodge said kindly. &ldquo;But what would you do if such things  happened? And they are likely to happen to any widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  managed to say. Really, she was almost speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no need to  worry!&rdquo; Splodge laughed, hopping around in great bounds, until Mrs. Koala  muttered to herself, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s daft!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to worry a  teeny, weeny bit!&rdquo; Splodge laughed again. &ldquo;A manager will see to all that. He&rsquo;ll  see that no one steals things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he really?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed with joy. But her face fell almost immediately. &ldquo;Where can I find a  manager?&rdquo; she asked looking all round. &ldquo;Do you think old Mr. Wombat would do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He!&rdquo; Splodge yelled and  hopped with surprise. &ldquo;Old Wombo a manager! Why, you&rsquo;d have nothing left in  your larder after one night. Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what <i>am</i> I to do? Where can I find a manager?&rdquo;  Poor Mrs. Koala was nearly in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here!&rdquo; Splodge  shouted, patting himself on the chest.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page049.jpg" alt="here" width="500" height="451"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>You</i> will be so kind as to be the  manager?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala asked joyfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I will,&rdquo;  Splodge replied. &ldquo;With my experience and worldly knowledge I&rsquo;ll see that even a  mouse gets away with nothing. Tush! Just let me catch them trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a load off my  mind,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shake paws on the  agreement,&rdquo; Splodge replied holding out a paw to Mrs. Koala who solemnly took  it, and both shook with a grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; Blinky  whispered to Nutsy. &ldquo;A guest house of all things! Rabbits and rats in the best  beds, and snails and spiders using the bathroom. I&rsquo;m off! And I&rsquo;m going in a  minute too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like  living in a guest house either,&rdquo; Nutsy remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  Blinky exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be made a waitress. And you&rsquo;d have to carry plates of  soup up and down the tree all day long, and peel potatoes and onions till your  eyes drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page050.jpg" alt="waitress" width="379" height="500"></p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo;  Nutsy asked, not very impressed with this horrible picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh, I suppose I&rsquo;d  just ring the dinner-bell and sit down to eat with the guests and laugh and  tell them my &rsquo;speriences,&rdquo; Blinky said with a bored look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  Nutsy replied indignantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to clean Mr. Centipede&rsquo;s boots every  morning, and help your mother to make stews and stews, and you&rsquo;d have to eat <i>porridge</i>, lumps and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ndeed I won&rsquo;t&mdash;and  wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and <i>shan&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; Blinky replied,  and started to scramble through the thick bracken fern that grew at the foot of  the tree. Nutsy hurried after him calling out in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait on! Wait on! I&rsquo;m  coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala and her  manager were too busy to notice what was happening just round the gum-tree.</p>
<p>Blinky pushed straight  ahead, while Nutsy stumbled and struggled to catch up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;  Nutsy panted as she came up to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> going to see the pelicans,&rdquo; Blinky announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> coming too,&rdquo; Nutsy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! Can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re  in the way?&rdquo; Blinky asked crossly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a fellow go pelicanning by himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might be useful,&rdquo; Nutsy  replied. &ldquo;Anyhow I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; She tossed her little head in the air and pushing  past Blinky took the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back! Halt! In  the name of the policeman!&rdquo; Blinky shouted, scarlet with rage. (How dare a girl  be so rude to him!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand back; and  I won&rsquo;t halt; and you&rsquo;re not a policeman!&rdquo; Nutsy called back, still scrambling  ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re arrested!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page051.jpg" alt="stop" width="400" height="484"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here! What&rsquo;s all  the noise about?&rdquo; A stern voice demanded, frightening the two little koalas  almost out of their skins. There, right in front of them, stood Wally Wombat  junior. He was old Wombo&rsquo;s great great grandson, and very like his great great  grandfather he was. Had the same small eyes, wide brow, and that arrogant air  of his ancestor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Wallo!&rdquo;  Blinky gasped with relief. &ldquo;My word, you <i>did</i> give me a fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who told you to  call me Wallo?&rdquo; Mr. Wombat junior asked, looking very displeased. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>Walter</i> Wombat&mdash;Wally to only my oldest acquaintances.  Remember that!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page053.jpg" alt="waldo" width="584" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s snaky!&rdquo; Nutsy  whispered to Blinky. &ldquo;Be polite or he might kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Mr.  Walter Wombat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see my great great  grandmother,&rdquo; Blinky replied, never blinking an eyelid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she ill?&rdquo; Walter  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terribly ill. If we don&rsquo;t  get there very soon she&rsquo;ll be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, under those  circumstances I&rsquo;ll let you pass,&rdquo; Walter declared. &ldquo;Only remember, next time  you meet me, salute and say: &lsquo;Good morning, Your Eminence. How goes it?&rsquo; Then  pass on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Wallo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Walter  Wombat roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo;  Blinky replied, shaking with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on that way, my  young man, and some day you&rsquo;ll be as great a fellow as I am.&rdquo; Mr. Walter Wombat  gave his walking-stick a swish and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to  have to carry his shaving-water to <i>him</i> every morning at the guest house?&rdquo; Nutsy asked mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put gum in it so&rsquo;s  it would gum up all his whiskers,&rdquo; Blinky replied coldly.</p>
<p>Nutsy remained silent  after this remark, and found herself once more padding behind Blinky. He had  taken the opportunity to get in the lead again, and things went along much more  smoothly. Presently, to Blinky&rsquo;s surprise, he found himself walking along  paw-in-paw with Nutsy as the journey progressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the  pelicans&rsquo; place?&rdquo; Nutsy inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long way off. Over  two hills and then down along the swamp until we come to the lake,&rdquo; Blinky  answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Nutsy  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it when we were  coming back from the zoo,&rdquo; Blinky replied, &ldquo;and I counted all the hills home  from that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo; he  asked suddenly. &ldquo;Listen! Someone is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide,&rdquo; Nutsy whispered.</p>
<p>Together they scuttled  under the bushes and crouched silently peeping through the leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! This is  dreadful&mdash;terrible&mdash;shocking,&rdquo; the voice was saying, as its owner pit-a-pattered  nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s the  matter?&rdquo; Nutsy asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; Blinky  said, giving her a pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll die, I&rsquo;m sure,  if I don&rsquo;t get help,&rdquo; the voice was saying, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never have such a kind  friend again.&rdquo; Here the poor animal started to sob.</p>
<p>Blinky and Nutsy,  peering from their hiding-place, saw Mrs. Field Mouse wiping her eyes with the  corner of her apron. Over her arm she carried a basket almost as large as  herself, and in it was a bottle almost as large as the basket.</p>
<p>Blinky gave a cough.</p>
<p>Mrs. Field Mouse sprang  in the air. &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Are there robbers or cats about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only us, Mrs. Field  Mouse. Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Nutsy called, scrambling through the bushes to her  side. &ldquo;What is the matter? You seem to be in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, such a  dreadful thing has happened! I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse sobbed.  &ldquo;My very, very best friend is terribly sick, and I&rsquo;ve run and run for miles to  get a bottle of eucalyptus oil from Dr. Owl. And now I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going  to rub it on her chest. What <i>will</i> I  do?&rdquo; She sniffed back her tears and wiped her whiskers with a tiny paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! We&rsquo;ll come and  help you. Won&rsquo;t we, Blinky?&rdquo; Nutsy turned to her companion who looked  sorrowfully at the poor distressed little mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only too pleased,&rdquo;  Blinky replied. &ldquo;Let me carry your basket, Mrs. Field Mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lucky I am to meet  you,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse said as she dabbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your friend  terribly, terribly sick?&rdquo; Nutsy asked sympathetically as they started to walk  along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got  whooping-cough most dreadfully,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse replied. &ldquo;All last night I  sat beside her; listening to her whoops. And the sneezing&mdash;it was dreadful too.  So this morning I set out to see Dr. Owl and tell him all about it. I&rsquo;ve been  away all day, and I&rsquo;ve run for miles. Oh dear! I hope we&rsquo;re in time to save  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Dr. Owl say?&rdquo;  Nutsy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to put the  patient in a mustard bath and poultice her chest and back,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse  replied; &ldquo;but I said I couldn&rsquo;t do it, as I&rsquo;m not a nurse, so he gave me this  bottle of oil, and told me to rub her chest with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll make her  better,&rdquo; Nutsy said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do it for you and help you all I can. Where does  she live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the bottom of my  house,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse answered. &ldquo;I have the attic and she has the ground  floor. It&rsquo;s over on the other side of the hill. It&rsquo;s in one of Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s  wheat fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Blinky said with a  knowing look at Nutsy. &ldquo;Is it anywhere near his peanuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page055.jpg" alt="peanuts" width="400" height="311"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>exactly</i> near; but not very far away,&rdquo;  his tiny friend replied&mdash;&ldquo;but of course we don&rsquo;t go near his peanuts,&rdquo; she said  hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Blinky  said cheekily. &ldquo;Does your friend like peanuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they give her  indigestion,&rdquo; the little mouse replied. &ldquo;Besides, she likes wheat much better,  so we always have supper together. Oh! I hope she doesn&rsquo;t die. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t  die!&rdquo; And poor little mousie started to cry all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo; Nutsy  said. &ldquo;We might get there in time to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran and ran; then  stopped for a few moments to get their breath; then ran on, until the top of  the hill was reached. Down the other side they rushed, panting and puffing.  Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s house came into view, and to save time they scrambled under  the fence instead of going through the new wire gate. Over the cabbage patch,  and over the lettuce and asparagus beds, and through the potato field they  rushed. Past the pigs&rsquo; pen&mdash;giving Mrs. Hog the most dreadful fright. She and  the squealers were on a fossicking expedition, rooting up everything within sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting the way  this farm&rsquo;s run!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If Farmer Scratchet isn&rsquo;t discussing bacon in  a most untactful manner, he&rsquo;s allowing dogs, cows, and all the rest of the  good-for-nothing animals to tear and rush about this place, upsetting the  nerves of the most important tenants. Come on, piglets, root in this corner.&rdquo;  Squeals and a grand rush greeted her command; and to an onlooker one would have  thought great earthworks were in progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re nearly there!&rdquo; Mrs.  Field Mouse announced as they hurried through the wheat field. &ldquo;Just another  few yards to go,&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page057.jpg" alt="nearly" width="550" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>She zigzagged through  the tall grain stalks until a loud hacking cough was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s still alive!&rdquo; Mrs.  Field Mouse cried with joy. More coughing came, and sneezes by the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Nutsy  said in an alarmed voice. &ldquo;Your friend has a terribly big cough and sneeze. She  must have double whooping-cough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has!&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse exclaimed. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t make too much noise; it may frighten her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now they were almost at  the spot where the patient lay, hidden from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse called encouragingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give in! Keep up, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got the  medicine and friends.&rdquo; Another hacking cough came from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a terribly  big mouse!&rdquo; Nutsy whispered to Blinky, then&mdash;straight in front of them lay the  whooping animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s a porcupine!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the name of  her?&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse asked looking surprised. &ldquo;I always call her &lsquo;friend&rsquo; as  I&rsquo;d no idea who she was, except I knew she wasn&rsquo;t a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come at last;  but I think you&rsquo;re too late,&rdquo; Mrs. Porcupine gasped. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even raise my  quills now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to  die,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse replied with a tear, the tiniest tear in the world,  trickling down her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! Dr. Owl has sent  this eucalyptus oil along and we&rsquo;re to rub your chest and back with it. That&rsquo;ll  cure you in no time, and these friends are going to do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>can</i> we rub a porcupine&rsquo;s chest and back?  Look at the spikes!&rdquo; Nutsy whispered in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; Blinky half  whistled, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better pour it all over her and tell her to wriggle about on  the ground.&rdquo; Then suddenly he thought of something. &ldquo;Does it say <i>rub</i> her with it? All that writing on the  bottle! Those are the directions. Let me see what it says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy handed the bottle  to Blinky while the others waited expectantly for his verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> Dr. Owl said rub it on,&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse remarked.</p>
<p>Blinky gazed at the label  on the bottle. He didn&rsquo;t understand a word of it; but his little brain was  working quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hu-u-m!&rdquo; he declared  with an important air. &ldquo;I thought so! It doesn&rsquo;t say anything at all about  rubbing it on; it says, POUR THE OIL DOWN THE COUGHER&rsquo;S THROAT!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page059.jpg" alt="throat" width="400" height="348"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the others sighed  with relief&mdash;that is, Nutsy and Mrs. Field Mouse. The porcupine had other  thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; she  whined. &ldquo;I never drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to!&rdquo;  Blinky announced. &ldquo;Unless, of course, you want to be a corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All stiff and cold, and  no breath coming,&rdquo; Blinky explained.</p>
<p>The porcupine sighed,  then commenced coughing again, rolling from side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab her spikes!&rdquo;  Blinky commanded, &ldquo;while I pour it down her throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the porcupine  raised her quills until they stood up like a pin-cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said they  wouldn&rsquo;t work!&rdquo; Blinky cried angrily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s only pretending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s not. I&rsquo;m  quite sure she&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Mrs. Field Mouse said crossly. &ldquo;She nearly shook me out  of bed the other day when she was whooping, and being upstairs you can imagine  how the house shook and quivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house of Mrs. Field  Mouse was a few wheat-stalks cleverly bent together, while her bed was nestled  amongst the ears. That of the porcupine was directly on the ground underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must be done!&rdquo;  Nutsy said, looking with sorrow at the patient. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she cried excitedly,  as she broke off a wheat-stalk, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll <i>paint</i> her throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What colour?&rdquo; Blinky  asked immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No colours,&rdquo; Nutsy  remarked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll paint it with the oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a blessing,&rdquo; the  porcupine gasped, withdrawing her spikes.</p>
<p>Nutsy pushed the  wheat-ear into the bottle, then stooped over the porcupine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your mouth <i>wide</i>,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t  gurgle when I poke it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky and Mrs. Field  Mouse watched in silence, while the porcupine opened her mouth the tiniest bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it wider!&rdquo; Nutsy  ordered.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page061.jpg" alt="wider" width="514" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The porcupine did as she  was told and, losing not a second, Nutsy poked the wheat-ear right down her  throat.</p>
<p>A dreadful spluttering  and coughing was the outcome of the operation; in her fright the porcupine  almost sprang in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s taking  convulsions!&rdquo; Blinky shouted, scrambling for safety as the porcupine rolled and  wobbled about in a most distressing manner, all her quills on end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse cried. &ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the porcupine  gradually quietened. When the last quill lay flat on her back, she crawled  under a tuft of dry grass; then, looking at Nutsy, she smiled weakly and  whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better&mdash;much better,  and after a snooze I&rsquo;ll be <i>quite</i> better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; Mrs. Field  Mouse exclaimed running up a wheat-stalk with joy; then, taking a nibble of the  ripe grain, ran down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go now!&rdquo; Blinky  said immediately. &ldquo;Come on, Nutsy. We&rsquo;ve to find the pelicans, and its getting  late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s better,&rdquo;  Nutsy said as she was bidding good-bye to Mrs. Field Mouse. &ldquo;If she coughs  again poke the stalk down her throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with the little mouse&rsquo;s  thanks and tiny laughs ringing in their ears, the two bears proceeded on their  way. Daylight found them on the outskirts of the lake, where hundreds and  hundreds of pelicans were in residence. Unnoticed, they climbed a great  gum-tree overlooking the birds&rsquo; domain and, tired out with their journeying,  fell asleep after a good meal of the finest leaves. Here, all through the warm  day and late into the afternoon they slept. Just as the sun was sinking they  woke and, presently, started to scramble down the tree again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;re going  to bed,&rdquo; Blinky remarked disgustedly. &ldquo;What silly things! Why don&rsquo;t they play  in the moonlight as we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wake them up!&rdquo;  Nutsy said. &ldquo;When they see who we are probably they&rsquo;ll have games with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might gobble us up  in their big beaks,&rdquo; Blinky said doubtfully. &ldquo;Golly! What <i>big</i> beaks they have. Look at them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they won&rsquo;t be  angry if we speak to them politely,&rdquo; Nutsy remarked, &ldquo;anyway I&rsquo;m going to try.  I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I!&rdquo; Blinky  exclaimed boldly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a girl and I&rsquo;m ten times braver than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you go first then,&rdquo;  Nutsy said slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Ladies always go  first. Splodge told me that,&rdquo; Blinky replied, pushing Nutsy ahead as he spoke.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page062.jpg" alt="first" width="500" height="270"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Poof! You&rsquo;re afraid!&rdquo;  Nutsy said, with a note of contempt in her voice, as she bravely padded down to  the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Council Meeting</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page063.jpg" alt="four" width="527" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You shout at them,&rdquo;  Nutsy ordered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the biggest voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee up!&rdquo; Blinky yelled.  &ldquo;Hip, hip, hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; Nutsy  said, as dozens of pelicans ceased paddling about in the water and all, as if  by command, faced the intruders with looks of great surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught anything?&rdquo;  Blinky shouted, waving a paw.</p>
<p>The pelicans just looked  all the harder. They seemed rooted in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the fishing  going?&rdquo; Blinky asked at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too cheeky,&rdquo;  Nutsy said, poking him in the side. &ldquo;Ask them politely. No! Keep quiet and I&rsquo;ll  ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we come and see you  Mr. and Mrs. Pelicans?&rdquo; Nutsy called as loudly as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; came a  guttural reply, as the largest pelican of all advanced to meet the bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Nutsy and Blinky,&rdquo;  the two koalas responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m none the wiser,&rdquo;  the big bird said shaking his head from side to side as he met the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; Nutsy  said meekly, holding her breath as she looked up at the huge bird with that  very large bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind telling me  what&rsquo;s in your scooper?&rdquo; Blinky asked as he eyed the great pouch attached to  the pelican&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; the pelican  replied, and to show them how true it was he opened his mouth to its widest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Nutsy gasped. &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo;  Blinky exclaimed.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page065.jpg" alt="gosh" width="515" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With a snap the pelican  closed his mouth, so quickly and decidedly that the two little bears jumped  with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open your gate  again,&rdquo; Blinky said when he had at last recovered his self composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Nutsy hissed  giving Blinky&rsquo;s foot a kick. &ldquo;He could swallow us in one gulp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you see what the  day&rsquo;s fishing has been like,&rdquo; the pelican remarked, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re holding a  meeting to-night to discuss the whys and what-nots of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we come?&rdquo; Nutsy asked  excitedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be very quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pelican looked at  her for a minute, tilting his head on one side, then on the other, eyeing her  with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re strictly  private&mdash;our meetings,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Only the aldermen are admitted. I&rsquo;m  the mayor, as no doubt you can see by my large paunch, and it all rests with me  whether I say yes or no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How important,&rdquo; Nutsy  said admiringly. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you take us to the meeting as guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I could if it  came to a scratch,&rdquo; the pelican replied, still looking very thoughtfully at the  two little bears. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be prepared for a rumpus,&rdquo; he said warningly.  &ldquo;And if there is one it&rsquo;s a case of every man for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens to all the  womans?&rdquo; Nutsy interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re crushed to  death,&rdquo; Blinky replied immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; the  pelican said with annoyance. &ldquo;Women are not admitted to our council meetings,  they&rsquo;re held in camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do-you-mean-to-tell-me-you-all-sit-in-a-camera?&rdquo;  Blinky asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the  pelican replied, puffing out the pouch in his bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t  open the gate again,&rdquo; Blinky said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h!&rdquo; Nutsy scowled  at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who takes the  photos?&rdquo; Blinky asked, returning to the former discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What photos?&rdquo; the  pelican asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re all sitting  in the camera,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;upon my soul! You&rsquo;re  goofy,&rdquo; the pelican retorted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what sitting in camera means?  Well&mdash;really, I didn&rsquo;t think it possible.&rdquo; Here the pelican opened his mouth and  gave a terrific yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! You&rsquo;ll break  the hinges,&rdquo; Blinky shouted as he quickly edged away.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page066.jpg" alt="hinges" width="500" height="318"></p>
<p>The pelican ignored his  remark completely. But coming right over to where Blinky was standing, half in  and half out of a prickly bush, he snapped his bill at him and asked very  crossly: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your mother send you to school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I wouldn&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted, trying to cover up his nervousness by making as much noise as  possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> explains it!&rdquo; the pelican said coldly. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> why you don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;sitting in camera&rsquo; means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake tell  me, and don&rsquo;t talk so much,&rdquo; Blinky retorted. He was clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means sitting behind  closed doors,&rdquo; the pelican replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a smack you&rsquo;d  get if someone suddenly opened it,&rdquo; Blinky said with a sneer. &ldquo;No closed doors  for <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worse than I  thought you were,&rdquo; the pelican said with disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no more time to waste  on such silly simpering people.&rdquo; Taking a huge watch from under his wing he  shook it violently, then looked at its face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed,  &ldquo;the meeting will have started if I don&rsquo;t get a hurry on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> let us come!&rdquo; Nutsy pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that Blinky behaves himself,  Mr. Pelican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor&mdash;if&mdash;you&mdash;<i>please!</i>&rdquo; the pelican said looking  sternly at the two bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. You  see, you&rsquo;re the first mayor I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite  understandable,&rdquo; the pelican replied. &ldquo;Mayors are <i>very</i> rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So taking it for granted  that they were to be admitted to the meeting, the koalas followed the pelican,  round the edge of the lake to a secluded swamp fringed with tall reeds. Here  thousands of pelicans had forgathered, and the snapping and scraping of beaks  made a noise like a gale in the trees. As the mayor appeared, all those  hundreds and hundreds of pelicans opened their mouths to their full extent and snapped  three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s that thing  the mayor called a rumpus, for goodness&rsquo; sake keep away from their snappers.&rdquo;  Blinky whispered to Nutsy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be cracked in halves like walnuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty superior looking  pelicans stood in a semicircle, to the centre of which the mayor advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the aldermen&rsquo;s  wives at home?&rdquo; the mayor solemnly asked before commencing business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Your Worship,&rdquo;  came the chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll open the  meeting,&rdquo; the mayor announced with great dignity.</p>
<p>Blinky heard a reed  rustle close to where he and Nutsy were sitting on a water-worn stump of  mangrove-tree. Quickly looking in that direction he saw many eyes peering  through the reeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the wives,&rdquo; he  whispered to Nutsy. &ldquo;Will I tell the mayor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course not!&rdquo; Nutsy  replied indignantly. &ldquo;Mind your own business.&rdquo; Just at that moment the mayor  rapped his large webbed foot on the stone that served as a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off we go!&rdquo; he shouted.  &ldquo;Any complaints barring the usual one of pilfering fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a clamour arose, so  many bills snapped and opened, that it was impossible to hear an intelligible  remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! Order!&rdquo; the  mayor shouted, while the twenty aldermen began to mark time rapidly with their  large webbed feet.</p>
<p>Squish, squash, squish,  squash, they pancaked the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that squelching!&rdquo;  the mayor shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the cause of  all the trouble!&rdquo; several angry pelicans screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What? How?&rdquo; the  mayor asked above the noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the cause of  the famine,&rdquo; the others shouted. &ldquo;Playing the organ all day long in the swamp;  kneading the bread just where the mud&rsquo;s the thickest, until the fish all swim  away, and no respectable pelican can wade in up to his knees without becoming  covered in mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about our bills?&rdquo;  someone shouted above the uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; came a chorus of  shouts. &ldquo;What about our bills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo; the  mayor shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re all  mud larks?&rdquo; someone else asked. &ldquo;Our pouches were made to catch fish in&mdash;not  scoops for mud. Any one would think we were two-legged dredges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; the mayor  ordered, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll close the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a jolly good job if  you did,&rdquo; a pelican in the back row shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the frog  banquet you and the aldermen had last night?&rdquo; a tiny skinny moulting pelican  piped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nose is too long!&rdquo;  the mayor shouted amid the uproar. &ldquo;Aldermen, see that his nose is decapitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aldermen hastily  scribbled in large books that hung around their necks: &ldquo;One nose&mdash;decapitate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame! Shame!&rdquo; came a  chorus of cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next complaint!&rdquo; the  mayor demanded, snapping his beak so that Nutsy and Blinky jumped with  nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break his  snapper, for sure,&rdquo; Blinky whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about relief for  the widows?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the widows!&rdquo; the  mayor mumbled under his breath. Aloud he asked: &ldquo;Can any one suggest something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> can!&rdquo; came a squeaky voice from behind the reeds. &ldquo;All you fat aldermen,  the mayor included, go out and catch some fish for us poor widows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mayor puffed his  pouch out with indignation. &ldquo;The <i>very idea!</i>&rdquo;  he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought all the wives were at home,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;How did women  get into this meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the widows!&rdquo;  someone called, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re not responsible for <i>them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make them go  themselves,&rdquo; the aldermen shouted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always stirring up trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a jolly good  idea!&rdquo; the mayor declared. Pointing to the reeds he called out in a loud voice.  &ldquo;Widows&mdash;stand before me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a rush the reeds  parted in all directions, and out marched a hundred widows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eavesdroppers!&rdquo; the  mayor hissed at them as they stood two deep in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traitors!&rdquo; the aldermen  whispered to one another. The widows ignored the remarks, and an old lady  pelican stepped out from the rest. Advancing towards the mayor she astounded  every one by rapping him sharply on the bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my lad!&rdquo; she  exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been enough of this nonsense. Frog banquets, eel snacks,  and all the rest of it. Cut it out, or out <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; the  mayor asked looking very subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Equal rights!&rdquo; the old lady  shouted. &ldquo;No puddling in squashy mud holes. No sitting in the background while  you and the aldermen fish in the best and cleanest water. Give us permission to  hold a fishing party&mdash;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, hear!&rdquo; the other  ninety-nine widows screeched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we want a <i>permanent</i> fishing-ground,&rdquo; the old lady  pelican demanded. &ldquo;None of your fished-out pools and corners with half a dozen tadpoles  in them,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them the weedy end  of the lake,&rdquo; an alderman whispered to the mayor, who seemed to be speechless with  anger and surprise. He nodded his head upon hearing this advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; he said in an  icy tone, &ldquo;you and the rest of the widows can have the south end of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of weeds!&rdquo;  the old lady shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it or leave it!&rdquo;  the mayor thundered, now regaining his self-composure. &ldquo;And in future,&rdquo; he  added to the whole of the meeting, &ldquo;you others keep away from that part of the  lake. Those are the widows&rsquo; weeds. I&rsquo;ll have no arguments. The matter&rsquo;s closed.&rdquo;  And to emphasize his words&mdash;snap! went his beak.</p>
<p>And so, to this day that  particular part of the lake is known as &ldquo;The Widows&rsquo; Weeds&rdquo;, and a jolly good  fishing-ground it is too.</p>
<p>Seeing the determined  look in the mayor&rsquo;s eyes the widows wisely said nothing more; but the old lady  pelican, as she was retiring from the meeting, gave one of the aldermen a nasty  dig in the side with her beak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that down in your  book,&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;South end of lake, reserved for widows only. And don&rsquo;t let  me catch any of you aldermen snooping around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nasty individual!&rdquo;  the mayor whispered to the nearest alderman.</p>
<p>The widows tramped as  loudly as they could, leaving the meeting; snapping their beaks, tossing their  heads, and causing as much commotion as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve avoided a rumpus,&rdquo;  the mayor said with relief. &ldquo;And now gentlemen, we&rsquo;ll discuss the important  business of aviation. There&rsquo;s been far too little gliding and soaring going on  lately; we must keep our reputation of being the finest soarers in the bird  kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow the  widows!&rdquo; Blinky whispered to Nutsy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in soaring and  nose-diving. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see them  nose-dive with those big noses,&rdquo; Nutsy remarked regretfully as she followed  Blinky through the reeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see the <i>real</i> nose-diving if we follow the  widows,&rdquo; he said excitedly. &ldquo;Keep in the shadows. Old mother widow will kill us  if she sees us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In and out of the reeds  they stumbled and crawled, keeping at a safe distance from the widows.  Suddenly, the procession halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; Blinky  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; Nutsy  whispered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little koalas crept  closer, and peeping through the reeds saw to their surprise a large flat sandy  clearing at the lake&rsquo;s edge. All the widows lined up with a great deal of  chattering and pushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact!&rdquo; the old lady  pelican shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness! They&rsquo;re  going to fly,&rdquo; Nutsy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cheek of them!&rdquo;  Blinky said crossly. &ldquo;How are we going to follow them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they had time to  discuss the matter, the old lady pelican shouted: &ldquo;Soar!&rdquo; and up the whole company  of widows went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Blinky  said decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them!&rdquo; Nutsy  exclaimed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bears were  held spell-bound as they watched the great birds soar higher and higher, with  the most effortless, noiseless and graceful action, then away&mdash;away to the south  they flew in formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can&rsquo;t see the  fishing party,&rdquo; Blinky wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we can! Yes we can!&rdquo;  Nutsy cried dancing up and down. &ldquo;Look! They&rsquo;ve landed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sure enough they  had; but it was fully a mile away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo;  Blinky said, scrambling ahead. Round the lake they bustled and into the reeds  again, always keeping the widows in sight. It was a long journey for little  legs not used to the ground; but the excitement of what lay ahead kept their  courage up, and after many rests and many exclamations of &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bother!&rdquo;  when they stumbled, they at last came within a few yards of the Widows&rsquo; Weeds.  And weedy it was! Up to their knees amongst weeds of all descriptions,  including beautiful yellow and pink water-lilies, the widows dabbled with their  beaks. Filling their pouches with all kinds of rubbish, they cleverly washed  away the unwanted collection, then tipping their heads back swallowed the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck! I wish I had a  fishing trap like that!&rdquo; Blinky remarked, then laughed at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them!&rdquo; he said,  pointing to two pelicans who were quarrelling over a catch.</p>
<p>One had her strong beak  around the other&rsquo;s neck, just like a pair of scissors, trying to force back a  fish that the second one was swallowing.</p>
<p>They tussled and  wriggled, all the time the scissors held firmly round the victim&rsquo;s neck. But  the owner of the fish was quite determined not to lose her catch. After fully  five minutes of his wrestling she gave a quick jerk with her head, released the  grip of the robber and swallowed her fish.</p>
<p>Frogs croaked in terror  as they were gobbled up by the dozens. It was a great party for the widows.  After the first excitement had died down, the fish became wise and swam farther  into the lake. But the widows were prepared for this. Very quietly they waded  out, forming a semicircle. The water was shallow, and great quantities of fish  leaped in the air as they were pursued. Closing in, the widows began slowly to  wade towards the shore, driving the fish before them. What a time they had!  Each escaping fish was pounced upon and stored away in the pouch, until the pouch  began to swell, then a quick jerk of the head, and many poor little fish went  down a slippery dip into a dark tummy.</p>
<p>Now, as the fish were  driven right up to the edge of the lake, a great noise arose. Wings flapped,  beaks opened and shut like lightning and the widows dined as they&rsquo;d never dined  since their husbands died.</p>
<p>Nutsy and Blinky watched  in silence. This was something they&rsquo;d never seen before. For many hours they  watched. Then, when the last widow had taken flight back to her home, two  little koalas crept from their hiding-places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to  catch a fish,&rdquo; Blinky announced.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page074.jpg" alt="fish" width="375" height="233"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; Nutsy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out an eel doesn&rsquo;t  bite you,&rdquo; Blinky said as he dipped one foot in the water, then the other.</p>
<p>But Nutsy was as brave  as he. Carefully wading into the water, she showed Blinky that she was quite  capable of looking after herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the frogs,&rdquo;  Nutsy called, &ldquo;only the biggest fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear out of here and  let me get some sleep,&rdquo; an irritable voice growled. &ldquo;This poking about in the  water all night long nearly drives me mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Nutsy  whispered.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page074a.jpg" alt="who" width="411" height="284"></p>
<p>Blinky stood still,  water up to his tummy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon!&rdquo; he  shouted. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear out! Clear out!  and let me get some sleep,&rdquo; the voice came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>your</i> lake!&rdquo; Blinky replied, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll  fish in it if we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same  moment he gave a howl of pain and surprise; then flopped right on his back into  the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My toe! My toe!&rdquo; he  yelled. &ldquo;Help me, Nutsy!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page075.jpg" alt="toe" width="503" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Nutsy waded as quickly  as she could to where Blinky was floundering and yelling in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she cried with  fright. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Help  me! My toe&rsquo;s being bitten off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Take my paw,&rdquo;  Nutsy half sobbed with fright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky grabbed with all  his might, nearly pulling Nutsy down as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My toe!&rdquo; he kept  crying. &ldquo;My toe&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it up and let me  see&mdash;quickly!&rdquo; Nutsy said, trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>With a great effort,  still shouting with pain, Blinky lifted his foot from the water. Just as he  raised it, a great ugly red crab fell with a splash, back into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Nutsy gasped. &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Run  for the shore or he&rsquo;ll bite you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, and you too, if  you don&rsquo;t clear out,&rdquo; came the angry voice from under the water.</p>
<p>Struggling and splashing  the two little koalas raced for the brink of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brute!&rdquo; Blinky  cried. &ldquo;The bad-tempered old thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cheek!&rdquo; came a deep  command from the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer him. Run  quickly,&rdquo; Nutsy said, still terrified.</p>
<p>But Blinky remained just  long enough to hurl a large stone into the water, then scuttled away as quickly  as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for  trouble,&rdquo; Nutsy scolded. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve all the way home to go, and you with a sore  toe too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hurting! It  never hurted!&rdquo; Blinky remarked brazenly.</p>
<p>Nutsy was not surprised  to hear this. She sighed, and gently taking Blinky&rsquo;s paw, they walked along,  back past the pelicans&rsquo; meeting-place, where all was quietness, and into the  bush track again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;  Blinky asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, of course!&rdquo; Nutsy  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Blinky  announced, stopping in his tracks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Mr. Crocodile!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page077.jpg" alt="see" width="550" height="329"></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>what?</i>&rdquo; Nutsy gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to see Mr. Croc!&rdquo;  Blinky said, not daring to look at Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do-you-know-what-he&rsquo;ll-do?&rdquo;  Nutsy asked with deliberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Blinky retorted  cheekily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;Good day, Blinky! Would you like a ride on my back?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And would you go?</i>&rdquo; Nutsy asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; Blinky  announced. &ldquo;It would be most &rsquo;citing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming home!&rdquo;  Nutsy said sternly. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re coming home with me.&rdquo; She grabbed him firmly by  a paw and started to drag him along the track. He lay on the ground and kicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>bad, bad</i> boy!&rdquo; Nutsy scolded. &ldquo;Wait till  Splodge hears of this!&rdquo; She started to struggle with him again, dragging and  pulling the kicking little imp along the track.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page079.jpg" alt="bad" width="523" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; a  gruff voice demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this dust kicking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out on to the track  stepped Mr. Walter Wombat again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come home! He  says he&rsquo;s going to see Mr. Croc!&rdquo; Nutsy cried. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll be killed for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to see Mr. Croc,  is he?&rdquo; Mr. Walter Wombat remarked in a cold voice, grabbing Blinky by the ear.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going home my boy&mdash;that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he said sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only pretending!&rdquo;  Blinky said sulkily. &ldquo;Let go my ear or I&rsquo;ll bite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Walter Wombat shook  Blinky until his teeth chattered. &ldquo;Get home at ONCE!&rdquo; he roared, releasing his  grip on the little scallawag.</p>
<p>Blinky scrambled away,  far quicker than he thought it possible, Nutsy following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You big tell-tale,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I <i>hate</i> girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growling and grumbling  he trotted ahead, a very tired and irritable little bear. Dawn was fast  approaching. A dim grey light appeared in the east and the trees gradually shed  their dark shapes of the night. The birds awoke, calling and singing their  morning greeting. Rabbits scurried from their burrows in search of breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our tree!&rdquo;  Nutsy cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to be home again&mdash;and there&rsquo;s Splodge hopping about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where mother  is?&rdquo; Blinky remarked a little nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose she&rsquo;s up in  the tree getting our breakfast ready, and crying and crying &rsquo;cause she thinks  we&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; Nutsy replied, looking very sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t know my mother when she&rsquo;s angry,&rdquo; Blinky said with scorn.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s most probably getting a big stick ready to whack us with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it hurt?&rdquo; Nutsy  whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Blinky  replied, &ldquo;specially if it&rsquo;s a new green stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve never been  whacked before,&rdquo; Nutsy now began to cry in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy crying!&rdquo; Blinky  scoffed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over in a minute, and then my mother usually kisses me, and  gives me the nicest gum-tips that she&rsquo;s collected specially for the occasion.  Besides&mdash;she&rsquo;s not a bit grumpy for a long time afterwards. If I&rsquo;m naughty right  on top of the whacking she only says &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Blinky darling,&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i>Try</i> and be a good boy now.&rsquo; So you see  its worth the minute it hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page080.jpg" alt="fancy" width="350" height="308"></p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be  hurt,&rdquo; Nutsy howled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to let  her into my secret,&rdquo; Blinky mumbled to himself, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s such a good secret  too. Bother her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop howling!&rdquo; he  commanded. &ldquo;Come over here and help me to collect some leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Nutsy asked  between sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For padding, of course!&rdquo;  Blinky remarked, looking with a very bored expression at his companion. &ldquo;Hurry  up, and don&rsquo;t look so vacant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scratching a pile of  leaves together, Blinky then began to stuff pawfuls down Nutsy&rsquo;s little dress,  then, when that had been completed to his satisfaction, he stuffed the back of  his trousers with more leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she notice how  fat we look?&rdquo; Nutsy asked doubtfully. &ldquo;And I rustle terribly when I walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be too cross to  notice anything &rsquo;cept we&rsquo;re back,&rdquo; Blinky replied. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get it over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in for it!&rdquo;  Splodge remarked as he spied the two little bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she very mad?&rdquo;  Blinky asked hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramping!&rdquo; Splodge said  waving his paws about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen your mother so snaky before. She says  she&rsquo;s going to give you the biggest, soundest, hugest whacking you&rsquo;ve ever had  in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Blinky whispered.  &ldquo;She <i>must</i> be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy began to whimper  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that noise!&rdquo;  Blinky gritted the words out between clenched teeth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;re <i>whack-proof?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up the tree as  quickly as possible,&rdquo; Splodge advised, &ldquo;Every minute makes a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-way up the tree Mrs.  Koala saw them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My goodness!</i>&rdquo; she said in a quivering voice. &ldquo;Wait until you get up  here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both sorry!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll do all your messages for you if you want any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up here!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  commanded in cold tones. She reached down for Blinky&rsquo;s paw and landed him up on  the branch beside her with a jerk. Then Nutsy followed. Both little bears began  to talk rapidly and offer explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No excuses!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said angrily, grasping a fresh green twig in one hand and Blinky by the scruff  of the neck in the other.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page081.jpg" alt="excuses" width="500" height="342"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Get it over quickly!&rdquo;  he said, bending the well-padded region uppermost.</p>
<p>Whack! Whack! Whack!  came Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s stick. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach you to run away!&rdquo; she said, panting  from the exertion. &ldquo;Go up to the highest branch and don&rsquo;t dare to move from  there until I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; Blinky  meekly replied, rustling alarmingly as he crawled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to whack  me too?&rdquo; Nutsy asked, looking at Mrs. Koala with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page082.jpg" alt="whack" width="420" height="320"></p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t this time,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;m sure Blinky put the idea into your head; but next time I&rsquo;ll  do it, Blinky or no Blinky. Go over to that corner and stand with your nose in  it until I get you to come away.&rdquo; Mrs. Koala pointed to the cosiest corner of  the old gum-tree&mdash;a corner well overhung with nice green leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pet!&rdquo; Blinky  growled shrugging his shoulders as he climbed to his appointed place, then  taking out the padding from his trousers, flung the leaves in a shower right on  top of Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  demanded, looking at the pile of leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the tree  moulting,&rdquo; Blinky explained, screwing his nose up at Nutsy, who was watching  him out of the corner of her eye, not knowing what was going to happen next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pet!&rdquo; he hissed at her.  &ldquo;I hope those leaves in your dress prick you most dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting that Mrs. Koala  might he watching, Nutsy began to pull out the leaves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala coldly  watched the proceeding until it was over, then, stepping over to where Nutsy  stood, asked in a slow deliberate voice, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whack-proof!&rdquo;  Nutsy said trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>what!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Koala exclaimed, a glint of  anger reappearing in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve brought you back  padding for the guests&rsquo; beds!&rdquo; Blinky called out from above, where he&rsquo;d been  watching everything in suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thoughtful of you,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala said, her anger changing immediately to joy. &ldquo;Just what I needed, as  Mrs. Possum is coming to-morrow and she was most emphatic that I should prepare  a soft bed for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get you plenty  more,&rdquo; Blinky shouted, &ldquo;only of course, I&rsquo;ll have to come down and get them off  the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I could help him!&rdquo;  Nutsy said instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any help!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why  you both shouldn&rsquo;t help me,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;After all, that&rsquo;s what  children are for. Both of you go down and bring me up as many leaves as  possible. Altogether, I&rsquo;ve ten guests arriving to-morrow, and clean, soft beds  are most necessary. My manager told me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala spoke with a  note of pride in her voice. The two little bears took no notice of this last  part of her conversation, as they weren&rsquo;t a scrap interested in the guests&rsquo;  beds. All they wanted to do was to get down on the ground and collect leaves.  It was much nicer than being confined to one spot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala fussed and  fussed about, poking and patting corners into cosy beds, while Splodge gave  orders to Blinky and Nutsy who collected piles of leaves. Up and down the tree  they climbed until Mrs. Koala was satisfied that all lumps and bumps in the  beds had been padded so well that all the guests would be most comfortable.  Then a supper of leaves for themselves, eaten between calling out remarks to  Splodge who sat at the foot of the tree, completed all arrangements.</p>
<p>Much to Blinky&rsquo;s and  Nutsy&rsquo;s relief, Mrs. Koala never mentioned the running-away again.</p>

  The Guest House</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page085.jpg" alt="five" width="548" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Towards evening of the  following day the guests began to arrive. First of all came a most  distinguished gentleman, Mr. Tree-Kangaroo. He was cluttered up with luggage&mdash;all  attached to his tail, by the way&mdash;and judging from his appearance he had come a  long way. &ldquo;A-hem!&rdquo; he coughed, as he approached the manager&rsquo;s office, where  Splodge sat on a flat rock, underneath the bough of a pretty sapling. A large  book and pencil lay before him on the stump of a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the &lsquo;A Home  Away From Home&rsquo;, guest house?&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo asked, looking disdainfully  down his nose at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; Splodge  replied politely. &ldquo;Are you seeking accommodation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, providing the  house is <i>select</i> and no gay parties at  night,&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo said with a look upwards to where Mrs. Koala was  busily engaged preparing the supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only people with  references taken,&rdquo; Splodge snapped. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to see yours before you sign  the visitors&rsquo; book. All terms to be paid in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit sudden, isn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo answered, feeling in his pouch for the necessary papers  and money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to protect  ourselves against impostors,&rdquo; Splodge replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; Mr.  Tree-Kangaroo said hurriedly, still fumbling in his pouch.</p>
<p>Splodge eyed him  suspiciously, while the traveller slowly emptied all sorts of odds and ends on  the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my pipe, and  there&rsquo;s my tobacco,&rdquo; he said as he pulled out a twig with a gum-nut attached to  it, also several dry leaves, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s my hanky,&rdquo; pointing to a grubby piece  of rag. &ldquo;But where in the world is my money? Ah&mdash;here we are!&rdquo; he exclaimed with  a big sigh. &ldquo;I knew I had it, and there&rsquo;s my banking account for reference.&rdquo; He  handed Splodge a shiny sixpence, together with a piece of torn newspaper.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page087.jpg" alt="here" width="517" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;  Splodge said clapping him on the back, and dropping the sixpence in a rusty  tin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think for a minute I distrusted you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But one has to be  so careful in this business. Think what would happen if a couple of locusts got  loose in the pantry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Low fellows!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sign the  visitors&rsquo; book,&rdquo; Splodge said handing the guest the pencil, &ldquo;and do you mind  not wetting it first&mdash;it&rsquo;s that bluey stuff. If you jab hard enough it will show  up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tree-Kangaroo jabbed  right through the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nuisance!&rdquo;  Splodge remarked ripping out the underneath page. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all loss!&rdquo; And  flipping the paper over his shoulder, he called to Blinky to help the guest  carry his luggage up the tree.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page086.jpg" alt="page" width="550" height="339"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;by the way, do you  want breakfast in bed?&rdquo; Splodge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any extra  charge?&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you get up and  carry it there yourself,&rdquo; Splodge answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a  cash-and-carry business?&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo demanded crossly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My apologies, sir!&rdquo;  Splodge said at once. &ldquo;Perhaps I was over-eager to please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just a <i>little</i> too eager to please yourself,&rdquo;  the guest remarked haughtily. &ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Help me up with my luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mean <i>me</i>, does he?&rdquo; Blinky asked Splodge, pointing  to the guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Splodge  whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;Help him up and be most polite. He&rsquo;s a bit ruffled  already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am <i>I!</i>&rdquo; Blinky declared. Then walking over  to the guest he announced in a loud voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Blinky Bill, and that&rsquo;s what  you&rsquo;ve got to call me&mdash;not <i>Boy!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A modern child I  suppose,&rdquo; the guest remarked. &ldquo;Never mind, we won&rsquo;t quarrel over names; give my  tail a lift up, boy&mdash;and be mighty careful the way you handle it. I&rsquo;ve had  rheumatiz in the end of it very badly lately. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve come here. A  change of climate and a little warmth may work wonders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach him not to  call me <i>Boy!</i>&rdquo; Blinky muttered as Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  started up the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift it! Lift it!&rdquo; he  shouted irritably as Blinky made no effort to help with his tail.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page089.jpg" alt="lift" width="371" height="600"></p>
<p>Rushing to his aid,  Blinky grabbed the tip of the guest&rsquo;s tail and lifted with all his strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  grunted with satisfaction&mdash;then a howl of pain came from his lips, as Blinky bit  savagely the very tip of the gentleman&rsquo;s tail. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll teach him!&rdquo; he grunted  to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be <i>acute</i> rheumatiz!&rdquo; he said aloud, as Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  turned to inspect his tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst twinge I&rsquo;ve  ever had!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get up quickly. Another one of those and I&rsquo;d <i>die!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be pretty  painful,&rdquo; Blinky replied, staggering under his load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful! Dreadful!&rdquo;  the guest puffed, mopping his head with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>Mrs. Koala stood ready  to receive her visitors, smiling and bowing graciously, while Nutsy stood  behind her, peeping at the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Here we are at  last!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo remarked as he shook paws with his hostess. &ldquo;You  really need a rope and basket to heave people up,&rdquo; he puffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea!&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it to my manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work it!&rdquo; Blinky  cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll haul them &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go and speak to the  manager about it,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said to her son, &ldquo;and ask him to make  arrangements about fresh cabbages and potatoes, also carrots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so busy  making up beds that I&rsquo;ve forgotten to order food,&rdquo; she explained to Mr. Tree-Kangaroo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like  a home away from home,&rdquo; he replied coldly. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you anything for supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;ve provided  for that,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said with a smile. &ldquo;Let me show you to your room.&rdquo;  Leading her guest to a very large comfortable bed, padded well with leaves, she  pulled a few branches together to make it more private.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks good!&rdquo; her  guest said turning back a few leaves and peering anxiously among them. &ldquo;No  spiders I hope!&rdquo; he remarked off-handedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said with a shocked expression. &ldquo;This is a <i>select</i> guest house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tree-Kangaroo flung  himself on the bed with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly take your boots  off!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said sternly. &ldquo;This is a home away from home, and I&rsquo;m sure you  wouldn&rsquo;t do that in your own home.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page091.jpg" alt="boots" width="507" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I quite forgot!&rdquo; her  guest apologized. Taking his boots off he flung them on the floor&mdash;as he  thought; but they went sailing down through the branches to land right on top  of the manager&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog&rsquo;s body!&rdquo; Splodge  roared. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guest&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo;  Blinky remarked as he dodged the boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgusting fellow!&rdquo;  Splodge expounded. &ldquo;For two whiskers I&rsquo;d throw him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t climb,&rdquo;  Blinky said looking at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>shake</i> him out if he doesn&rsquo;t behave,&rdquo;  Splodge replied. &ldquo;Anyway, what are you here for? Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m up to my  tail in work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky gave his message  to the surprised Splodge. &ldquo;Now, where in the world am I to get all those things  from?&rdquo; he said scratching his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Blinky  exclaimed. &ldquo;Over at Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s got dozens and dozens of cabbages  and carrots, and piles and piles of potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re to <i>steal</i> them!&rdquo; Splodge asked.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page092.jpg" alt="steal" width="500" height="291"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Blinky  replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll only borrow them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Borrow cabbages! And  how do you think we&rsquo;re going to return them when the guests have eaten them?&rdquo;  Splodge asked. &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll have to ask Farmer Scratchet if he&rsquo;ll sell them to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile three more  guests had arrived all asking for accommodation.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Goanna, and  their daughter, a fair-skinned, shy little thing, who darted around the back of  the tree and hissed loudly when Splodge looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want a double bed  and a single one!&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run up and tell your  mother to make up a double bed,&rdquo; Splodge ordered Blinky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to  sleep near me!&rdquo; Blinky said pointing at little Daisy Goanna. &ldquo;She makes noises  like ginger-beer bottles going off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you referring to my  Daisy?&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna asked with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s making awful  noises,&rdquo; Blinky retorted, &ldquo;just like escaping steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up and deliver my  message to your mother!&rdquo; Splodge thundered, while he made efforts to calm Mrs. Goanna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>double bed!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Koala exclaimed, upon hearing the message. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  strange&mdash;well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to do it,&rdquo; and straight-way she began piling the leaves  from one bed on top of the other. &ldquo;Fancy wanting a bed as high as that,&rdquo; she  said when the work was completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;rhaps the guest&rsquo;s a  bower bird,&rdquo; Nutsy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Hide my  blue slippers,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said excitedly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll steal anything blue, those  bower birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page093.jpg" alt="blue" width="600" height="321"></p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the dinner-gong  going?&rdquo; came from Mr. Tree-Kangaroo&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time now,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied, still thumping and pushing the double bed into shape.</p>
<p>A great deal of hissing  suddenly sounded at the foot of the tree, and Mrs. Koala peering down nearly  fell from the branch with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! If it&rsquo;s  not the Goanna family, all hissing like a lot of boiling kettles. Quick, Nutsy!  Get the tea ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Goanna family hissed  extraordinarily as they climbed the tree. With studied care they advanced step  by step, their great banded bodies bending from side to side, while their eyes  were fixed on one spot&mdash;Mrs. Koala&rsquo;s front door, or, in other words, the stout  branch that served as a doorstep to the upper regions of the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; Mr. Goanna  hissed as he wriggled on to the branch, followed by his wife and daughter. Mrs.  Goanna peered through a lorgnette made from grass. &ldquo;It could be made a little  more attractive,&rdquo; she hissed with her head in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the menu will  tempt our jaded appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is  quite select enough for us?&rdquo; Daisy Goanna asked, peeping this way and that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all depends on who  the other guests are,&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna replied. &ldquo;<i>We</i> at least will give tone to the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! There&rsquo;s the  proprietress!&rdquo; Mr. Goanna hissed as Mrs. Koala scrambled down the tree to greet  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna  wheezed. &ldquo;Is our suite ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come this way, please,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala replied with a bow. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s in readiness. One double bed and  one single bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rest for a few  minutes before tea,&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said, leading the way until the suite was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the double bed?&rdquo;  Mrs. Goanna asked, raising her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied pointing to the pile of leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> a single bed!&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna said haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied indignantly. &ldquo;Look at all the leaves I&rsquo;ve piled up. I took the top lot  from another bed&mdash;that makes it double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pathetic!&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna  sniffed, turning her head away. &ldquo;One can see yours is <i>not</i> a select guest house.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page095.jpg" alt="select" width="493" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> select!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied crossly. &ldquo;And <i>I&rsquo;m</i> the selector. I&rsquo;ll be pleased if you and your family will go  elsewhere. I entertain only the <i>best</i> people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Did you hear that?&rdquo;  Daisy Goanna hissed in horror. &ldquo;<i>We</i> the banded monitors, to be spoken to like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your bands and  your hissing away!&rdquo; came a deep growl from Mr. Tree-Kangaroo&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  waiting for my dinner and you&rsquo;re holding it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner?&rdquo; Mr.  Goanna suddenly asked, his eyes nearly popping out of his head. &ldquo;Any rabbits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  replied tartly. &ldquo;The rabbits are our guests, and not to be put on the menu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guests!&rdquo; All the Goanna  family hissed loudly. &ldquo;Rabbits for guests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, we eat  them by the dozen?&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna said with her head in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be  surprised!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied. &ldquo;In fact <i>nothing</i> you did would surprise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Bertram. This is  no place for respectable people like us,&rdquo; Mrs. Goanna said turning to her  husband, and in less than a minute all three were shuffling down the tree  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old coppers! That&rsquo;s  what they are!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala said to Nutsy. &ldquo;Hissing and spluttering around my  place like a wash-day at the zoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have poked  them overboard,&rdquo; Nutsy said sympathetically. &ldquo;I wish Blinky had been here. He&rsquo;d  have done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my tucker ready?&rdquo; Mr.  Tree-Kangaroo sounded as though he was becoming impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  called. &ldquo;Come this way into the dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie your apron and cap  on,&rdquo; she whispered to Nutsy. &ldquo;And when he comes up, hand him a few gum-nuts to  chew while I prepare his tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  climbed with great alacrity to the dining-room, where Nutsy stood, holding some  gum-nuts. She bowed ever so sweetly as the gentleman sat down on the branch,  and offered him the dainties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; he said with a grunt, eyeing the nuts with suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re to chew. To  keep you quiet till your tea is ready,&rdquo; Nutsy replied sweetly.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  did a dreadful thing. The rudest thing I have ever heard of. He raised his paw,  gave a nasty smack with it, and sent the nuts sky-high. Poor Nutsy opened her  mouth to cry; but Mrs. Koala, who had seen everything (and very nervous she  felt about it too), cried out:</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page097.jpg" alt="then" width="491" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming! I&rsquo;m coming!  Don&rsquo;t get mad! Here&rsquo;s your tea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for tea?&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  asked Nutsy, looking at her sternly, while she shivered from head to toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chewing-gum or leaves,&rdquo;  she replied stuttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s chewing-gum?&rdquo; Mr.  Tree-Kangaroo asked, glaring at Nutsy. &ldquo;Is it something new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;zactly,&rdquo; Nutsy  replied, fumbling with her paws. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as gum-leaves, only you chew  some leaves, and the others you just gobble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo  said in a slow deliberate manner, while his whiskers seemed to be quivering in  all directions at once. &ldquo;And <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what  you expect guests to eat in a select house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are! Here you  are!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala cried, fairly pushing the leaves under his nose. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the  first of the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And</i> the last!&rdquo; her guest roared as he pitched them in the same direction  as the nuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said under her breath. &ldquo;What a dreadful temper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my sixpence  back!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo demanded loudly. &ldquo;And my bank-book too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inquire for them at the  office,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied with her nose in the air. &ldquo;Come, Nutsy, we will see  if Blinky has returned with the cabbages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cabbages!</i>&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo fairly shouted. &ldquo;Have you any  cabbages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on order,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied with dignity. &ldquo;But they are only for gentlemen. Good day!&rdquo; and so  saying, she and Nutsy climbed higher in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity I lost my temper;&rdquo;  Mr. Tree-Kangaroo murmured to himself as he slowly climbed down the tree. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  years since I tasted a cabbage; but I suppose <i>their</i> cabbages would have slugs in them, so I&rsquo;ve not missed much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sixpence and  bank-book, please!&rdquo; he announced to the astonished Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you satisfied?&rdquo;  Splodge asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sixpence and  bank-book!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo thundered. &ldquo;And look slick, my lad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a penny  charge for resting on the bed,&rdquo; Splodge replied coldly. He, too, was beginning  to get cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>sixpence</i> and bank-book!&rdquo; Mr. Tree-Kangaroo roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of  spiders, <i>take them!</i>&rdquo; Splodge shouted  as he hurled the rusty tin containing the treasures at the guest.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page099.jpg" alt="love" width="600" height="363"></p>
<p>Mr. Tree-Kangaroo tucked  his sixpence and piece of newspaper carefully in his pouch, eyeing Splodge all  the while. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a boxing-match with you some day, my young codger,&rdquo; he  said shaking his paw at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind the step as you go  out!&rdquo; was Splodge&rsquo;s reply, then turning his back on the irate guest he spotted  that gentleman&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum-m-m!&rdquo; he growled to  himself. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get those anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Tree-Kangaroo had  entirely forgotten his shoes, and it was not until his feet became sore, many,  many miles farther on that he remembered them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s goodbye to <i>them</i>,&rdquo; he sighed sitting down to rest.  Back at the office of &ldquo;A Home Away From Home&rdquo; the manager was slowly and carefully  writing in a large book.</p>
<p class="note">Mr. Tree-Kangaroo.
Came and went. <br>
Profit&mdash;one  pair of shoes. <br>
Loss&mdash;nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too bad for the  first try,&rdquo; Splodge said to himself. &ldquo;But I can see things want livening up a  bit if we&rsquo;re to make this business pay. Moonlight picnics, dancing in the bush,  fishing excursions, snake-hunts&mdash;that&rsquo;s the idea! I&rsquo;ll go now and tell Mrs. Koala  what must be done. By the way it&rsquo;s time that young shaver, Mr. Blinky, was  back. I wonder where&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got to.&rdquo; Almost simultaneously with Splodge&rsquo;s thought  Blinky came tumbling through the bush, a large cabbage tightly held between his  front paws, and a very pleased look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get <i>that?</i>&rdquo; Splodge shouted, staring coldly  at the cabbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over at Farmer  Scratchet&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Blinky said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come by it  honestly?&rdquo; Splodge demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Blinky replied,  hugging the cabbage more tightly. &ldquo;I asked Farmer Scratchet if he&rsquo;d lend me a few  cabbages and carrots, and Mrs. Scratchet&rsquo;s clothes-basket, and instead of  saying &lsquo;Certainly, Blinky!&rsquo; he roared at me and said he&rsquo;d &lsquo;give me &rsquo;zactly one  minute to get off his premises.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you come by  that cabbage under those circumstances?&rdquo; Splodge said sternly, pointing to the  cabbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just walked out of  the gate, round the back of Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s house, popped under the fence  and grabbed it before it had time to call out for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s stealing!&rdquo;  Splodge thundered, &ldquo;and sure as eggs that very same cabbage will choke you if  you attempt to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o-h! I didn&rsquo;t know <i>that!</i>&rdquo; Blinky said in surprise. &ldquo;Will it  choke all the guests too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only the stealer of  it,&rdquo; Splodge replied. &ldquo;Here&mdash;hand it over while I taste it to see if it&rsquo;s  perfectly fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky handed over the  big crisp cabbage not without some misgivings. Splodge pulled a juicy leaf and  quickly gobbled the dainty; the second and third leaves disappeared in the same  way with startling rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! You&rsquo;ll have the lot  if you don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; Blinky shouted indignantly, making a grab at the cabbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outside leaves are  no good for guests, and I&rsquo;m only eating them,&rdquo; Splodge replied, holding the  cabbage at a safe distance from Blinky. &ldquo;You shin up the tree and tell your  mother to come down and have a look at it. Besides, I want to talk business  with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you eat another  leaf, or I&rsquo;ll not be responsible for my actions when I come back,&rdquo; Blinky said  as he started to climb the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo;  Splodge mumbled to himself as he crammed his mouth full of cabbage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just  taste one more leaf, from the heart, and then I&rsquo;ll not touch another.&rdquo; Saying  this, he pulled apart the creamy heart of the cabbage and instantly gobbled  half of it. The remainder looked very silly indeed, so he decided to finish it,  and be done with the whole affair. &ldquo;A half cabbage will only cause ill-feeling  and jealousy&mdash;so here goes!&rdquo; Splodge added. And away went the last little particle  of that beautiful green cabbage. &ldquo;The very idea of <i>stealing</i> a cabbage!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a lesson to  young man Blinky. I can&rsquo;t bear the thought of him stealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page102.jpg" alt="stuff" width="350" height="400"></p>
<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Koala,  Nutsy and Blinky stood in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cabbage?&rdquo;  Blinky demanded, glaring at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided it was best  to destroy it,&rdquo; Splodge explained. &ldquo;Stolen goods only cause trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you have the  biggest and longest stomach-ache you&rsquo;ve ever had in your life,&rdquo; Blinky shouted  with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you might have  waited until we could hold a consultation over the cabbage,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  remarked, looking at Splodge. &ldquo;After all, it was my son&rsquo;s cabbage and not  yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say no more about  it,&rdquo; Splodge replied, dismissing the subject with a wave of his paw. &ldquo;More  urgent business requires our attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place wants  pepping up,&rdquo; Splodge said impressively. &ldquo;Amusement for the guests&mdash; parties,  dances, excursions, picnics, and a bit of whoopee here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give you a  bit of whoopee here and there,&rdquo; Blinky said still glowering at Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said sternly, giving her son a gentle push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll adjourn  to my office, Mrs. Koala, and discuss the matter in quietness and privacy,&rdquo;  Splodge said, ignoring Blinky and Nutsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo; Mrs.  Koala replied. &ldquo;Blinky&mdash;you and Nutsy play about for a little while, until I  call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Nuts, let&rsquo;s go  for a walk,&rdquo; Blinky whispered. &ldquo;That Splodge is the greediest gobbler I&rsquo;ve ever  seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get another  cabbage?&rdquo; Nutsy asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Koala would like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course we can! We can  get dozens of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Blinky said with a worldly air. &ldquo;We can get carrots and  potatoes too&mdash;and Mrs. Scratchet&rsquo;s basket as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a surprise Mrs. Koala  will get,&rdquo; Nutsy said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry,&rdquo;  Blinky replied, running ahead through the bush.</p>
<p>It was moonlight. As the  two little bears approached Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s house, they saw a light gleaming  in the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in bed,&rdquo; Blinky  whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll crawl round to the laundry first and get the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy was trembling with  excitement. &ldquo;Has he a dog?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s chained up, and  besides, he&rsquo;s a friend of mine,&rdquo; Blinky answered.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer they  crept towards the laundry. The door was open and everything looked very simple  and easy. A few more steps and they stood in front of the door. There was the  clothes-basket, full of linen on top of the copper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to tip all  that rubbish out,&rdquo; Blinky remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up on top of the copper and throw  the stuff down. You be ready to help me down with the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page104.jpg" alt="tip" width="500" height="330"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hurry up,&rdquo; Nutsy  said nervously. &ldquo;Someone might catch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost immediately  Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s dog began to bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll catch us! He&rsquo;ll  kill us!&rdquo; Nutsy whispered. &ldquo;Hide in the copper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; Blinky  said excitedly. &ldquo;Hurry up or he&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two little koalas  scrambled into the copper, pulled the lid over them, and lay there with hearts  thumping, while Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s dog barked furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; a voice  roared from the house; but the dog still kept barking.</p>
<p>In a few moments heavy  footsteps came padding down the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the noise  about?&rdquo; Farmer Scratchet demanded.</p>
<p>The dog barked and  tugged at his chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to let  you off,&rdquo; Farmer Scratchet said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were  you,&rdquo; Blinky said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him not to,&rdquo; Nutsy  whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; Blinky  ordered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as dead as turnips if he finds us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearer came the  footsteps, and then&mdash;horror of horrors, Farmer Scratchet came into the laundry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any one  about he&rsquo;s in here,&rdquo; Farmer Scratchet said under his breath as he turned over  boxes, moved the gardening tools, looked behind the door, and actually in the  clothes-basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dog&rsquo;s a fraud!&rdquo; he  exclaimed. &ldquo;Yap, yap, yap, and no cause for any of it. For two pins I&rsquo;d give  him to the butcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blinky gave Nutsy a  nudge. They held their breaths, not daring to make the slightest sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerchoo!&rdquo; Farmer  Scratchet sneezed, making the windows rattle, and nearly, very nearly killing  the two little bears with fright.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page105.jpg" alt="sneeze" width="450" height="431"></p>
<p>&ldquo;A plague on that dog,&rdquo;  he said loudly and crossly. &ldquo;Here am I catching my death of cold, all through  his yapping. Bed&rsquo;s the best place for me!&rdquo; Saying this he stamped out of the  laundry and to Blinky&rsquo;s and Nutsy&rsquo;s delight, hauled his dog, chain and all,  round to the front of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he kind?&rdquo; Blinky  giggled as he and Nutsy wriggled out of the copper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to  faint,&rdquo; Nutsy said weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll push you under the  tap if you do,&rdquo; Blinky said sternly. &ldquo;Just you try any of those silly tricks  and you&rsquo;ll soon be sorry. Get down on the floor while I empty the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy did so, without  any further comment, while a shower of linen came hurtling through the air.  Piles of it flew in all directions, and finally the basket arrived after a good  kick from Blinky on top of the copper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for your  shins!&rdquo; he called as the basket toppled at Nutsy&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>In another few seconds  both little bears were tugging and pushing the cumbersome basket out of the  door and over the lawn. Under the fence, and across the paddock to where the  vegetables grew, they heaved and tugged, determined to accomplish their  mission. Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s best piece of rope, that he always used for hauling  logs and iron about, was the cause of at least half an hour&rsquo;s tussle, as Blinky  and Nutsy came upon it lying on the ground. They lifted and grunted, sighed and  heaved, as they pushed it into the basket, then off once more to the cabbage patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use taking more  than one cabbage, and one potato, and one carrot,&rdquo; Blinky said puffing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  never get home if we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Splodge was  here,&rdquo; Nutsy remarked. &ldquo;We could harness him to the basket and drag home lots  of cabbages then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo;  Blinky said looking at Nutsy. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not to be trusted after what happened  to the last cabbage&mdash;besides, he&rsquo;ll say its stealing, and we&rsquo;re only borrowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d be such a  help,&rdquo; Nutsy persisted. &ldquo;I could run home and get him while you fill the basket  up, ready to pull off when he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I get him he&rsquo;ll have  to promise not to eat our things, and not to growl,&rdquo; Blinky answered, &ldquo;and that  means&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to get the rope out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy was already in the  basket trying to heave the rope out. They pushed and poked, puffing and  grunting until the rope lay on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go for your life,&rdquo;  Blinky ordered, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be long, &rsquo;cause Farmer Scratchet might come around  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nutsy flew along the  track, while Blinky pulled up carrots and potatoes by the dozen. Into the  basket they went, with six fine cabbages perched on top. By the time he&rsquo;d  completed his job, Splodge and Nutsy came in sight, Nutsy perched on top of her  friend&rsquo;s back, while he made big bounds over to where Blinky stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What game is this?&rdquo;  Splodge demanded looking as cross as he possibly could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private business,&rdquo;  Blinky replied loftily. &ldquo;If you care to drag this basket home you&rsquo;ll be paid  with <i>one</i> potato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Splodge was speechless.  Such impudence&mdash;and from so small an animal too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hook your hind legs to  the basket with this rope,&rdquo; Blinky began to command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, my young  fellow. I&rsquo;m not hooking any of my hind legs to any baskets for any one for only <i>one</i> potato,&rdquo; Splodge said definitely.  &ldquo;One potato, one carrot, and one cabbage is my price. Take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s overcharging,&rdquo;  Blinky announced sternly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have to hire you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a word was mentioned  in regard to stealing as Splodge licked his lips while helping Nutsy and Blinky  to tie the rope to the basket handles, and then loop it over his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Nutsy had  better get in the basket too,&rdquo; Splodge said as he eyed the load, which to him  was a mere trifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted. &ldquo;Come on, Nuts, now for a joy ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up the two of them  scrambled, perching themselves between cabbages and clinging to the basket  sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard?&rdquo; Splodge  called. &ldquo;Off we go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a tremendous jerk  the basket bounded off the ground. Bump, bump, bump, over the paddock it went,  Splodge leaping ahead, while Blinky and Nutsy were bounced about among the  cabbages and potatoes.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page109.jpg" alt="bump" width="501" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Round the corners they  bounded, in and out of the trees, missing branches and rocks by a hairbreadth. Mrs.  Rabbit and her toddlers were out for an evening stroll. She looked with  amazement at this new kind of danger that came tearing along the bush track, then  with one startled scream called her babies to her side, and she and they dashed  into the undergrowth away from the hideous monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to turn all  my children cross-eyed,&rdquo; Mrs. Rabbit panted, as she lined her babies up under  cover of a big gum-tree and examined each carefully.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Splodge and  Co. went bounding along. &ldquo;The quicker home, the quicker I&rsquo;ll get my cabbage,&rdquo;  Splodge thought. Mrs. Koala up in the tree could not believe her eyes as she  saw Splodge and the contraption come tearing through the bush.</p>
<p>Wallop, wallop, wallop,  they came, amid calls and shouts from Blinky and Nutsy.</p>
<p>Down the tree Mrs. Koala  scrambled, nearly slipping in her excitement.</p>
<p>Splodge came to a  standstill, streams of puff coming from his nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what we&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;  Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potatoes and carrots  and cabbages!&rdquo; Nutsy shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  exclaimed. &ldquo;And how am I going to pay for it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all borrowed!&rdquo;  Blinky replied, dancing up and down, &ldquo;and the basket too&mdash;and the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  repeated. She was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll have to  return the basket and rope,&rdquo; Splodge explained, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see how we can  manage about the vegetables. Anyhow, there&rsquo;s acres of them over at Farmer  Scratchet&rsquo;s going to waste&mdash;sheer waste&mdash;and just asking to be picked and eaten.  It&rsquo;s a kindness to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  agreed. &ldquo;I never can understand humans allowing fields and fields of cabbages  and carrots to remain there, week in and week out.&rdquo;</p>

  Putting &ldquo;Pep&rdquo; In Things</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page111.jpg" alt="six" width="564" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>All through the night  Splodge, Mrs. Koala, Blinky and Nutsy worked at top speed. The whole place was  transformed. From a stout limb of the gum-tree dangled a rope, on the end of  which Mrs. Scratchet&rsquo;s basket swayed to and fro not far above the ground. At  the foot of the tree, neatly arrayed in rows, lay the carrots, potatoes and  cabbages, interspersed with watercress and gum-leaves. A large notice bravely planted  in the heart of the largest cabbage bore the following words for all the bush  folk to read:</p>
<p class="newspaper">&nbsp;Mrs. Koala feeds her guests on these things.  Take a good look. Have a good sniff (no tasting allowed). Then order your meals  and beds from the manager.</p>
<p class="newspaper">&nbsp;P.S. Under no circs need snakes apply. Ants  may apply for employment as garbage removers.</p>
<p class="newspaper">&nbsp;Signed, SPLODGE, Manager of this concern.</p>
<p>Either the smell of the  good things to eat, or that strange thing called bush telegraphy, had the  effect of bringing animals of all descriptions from all corners of the bush.  They peered and sniffed with their noses against the vegetables, dangerously  close to their mouths. But Splodge had his weather eye open. When he found an  animal a little too interested in the cabbages or carrots, he smartly rapped  the offender on the back with the order:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sniff and move on,  please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guests were booked in  bunches. The climax came when Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s old plough horse wandered upon  the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much for dinner?&rdquo;  he asked Splodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir, we&rsquo;re full  up,&rdquo; Splodge replied thinking very quickly. One dinner for Mr. Plough Horse  would mean no dinner for any one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine cabbages you have  there,&rdquo; Mr. Plough Horse remarked nodding in the cabbages&rsquo; direction. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  mighty like Farmer Scratchet&rsquo;s, the ones I helped to plough in.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page113.jpg" alt="horse" width="484" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re first cousins,&rdquo;  Splodge replied without twinking a whisker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my boy!&rdquo; Mr.  Plough Horse said under his breath, thrusting his nose right into Splodge&rsquo;s  face, &ldquo;you give me a couple of carrots, or I&rsquo;ll let Farmer Scratchet know about  this&mdash;cousins or no cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually bribe  people,&rdquo; Splodge said haughtily, &ldquo;but business is business and I hate the way  you snoop around, so take a couple of carrots and go. Mind you&mdash;if I catch you  holding private conversations with Farmer Scratchet it will be a bad day for  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Plough Horse gave a  loud long neigh and grabbed the carrots between this teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they get stuck  in his wind-pipe,&rdquo; Splodge said to Mrs. Koala who had been standing by,  nervously watching the whole business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pimp!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted. &ldquo;We all should chase him off our premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid an uproar of  growling, screeching and howling, Mr. Plough Horse was sent about his business.  After that everything proceeded quietly. From a branch of the gum-tree Nutsy,  at a given signal from Mrs. Koala, rang the dinner-bells, that is to say, she  waved a pawful of Christmas bells backwards and forwards, making the sweetest  tinkle imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; the guests  shouted. &ldquo;Hooray for a gobble!&rdquo; All the eatables had been carefully hoisted up  in the basket on to the biggest limb of the tree and there they were in full  view of the guests below.</p>
<p>As the dinner bell  sounded, a wild scramble up the tree commenced by those who were able to climb,  while the birds flew like darts up on to the bough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Mrs. and  Mr. Wombat wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me too?&rdquo; Mr. Wallaby  echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go up in the  basket,&rdquo; Blinky exclaimed triumphantly, as he proceeded to grab the rope. &ldquo;Get  in&mdash;one at a time, and no pushing and shoving,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies first,&rdquo; Mrs. Wombat  simpered shyly as she waddled towards the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and get in,&rdquo;  Blinky shouted.</p>
<p>Very clumsily Mrs. Wombat  fell into the basket with a shrill little scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; Splodge  said beckoning to Blinky to haul at the rope.</p>
<p>He hauled and hauled,  pulled and tugged; but the basket didn&rsquo;t budge an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the fattest  wombat I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo; Blinky said crossly, the perspiration running down his  nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s insulting me!&rdquo; Mrs.  Wombat complained in a whining tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon fix it!&rdquo;  Splodge remarked, bounding over to the basket. &ldquo;Let me there, Blinky, and when  I say &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; pull with all your might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo; he shouted.  &ldquo;Now&mdash;<i>go!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a rush Splodge  sprang away in the opposite direction, the rope well around his shoulders. Up  shot Mrs. Wombat in the basket, while Blinky was tumbled over and over in the  rush. Away the basket went, right up to the dining-room in the tree. Mrs. Wombat  gave a nervous shriek then, grabbing the limb of the tree with all her might,  she pulled herself out of the basket and sprawled all over the cabbages.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="0400581h-images/3page115.jpg" alt="rush" width="487" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A most awkward landing,&rdquo;  Mrs. Koala remarked as she rushed forward to grab her guest, while the basket  went whizzing to the ground again, ready for the next passenger.</p>
<p>All were hoisted up in  time, not without great excitement and many howls of dismay as the basket swung  perilously near to going over the limb on occasions; but no accident happened  and every one was elated when the sign to start dinner was given.</p>
<p>It was a strange sight.  Never before in the history of bushland had wombats, wallabies, kangaroos,  rabbits and such-like ground animals, had the pleasure of dining up in a tree.  The chatter and grunting was deafening. Shrill calls from the birds only  accentuated the din. The whole bush rang with mirth.</p>
<p>Just when the fun was at  its height&mdash;for Mrs. Wombat had suddenly swayed backward, and finding no branch  to support her, had nearly fallen head over heels out of the tree, had it not  been for Mr. Wallaby grabbing her around the leg and saving her from certain  death&mdash;Mrs. Grunty and her son Snubby came padding through the bush. Mrs. Grunty  had a scowl on her face. She was clearly annoyed. Hurrying along to the foot of  the tree, she demanded in a loud voice to know the reason of such &ldquo;goings on&rdquo;  in the bush. Splodge hurried out of his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for  you, Mrs. Grunty?&rdquo; he politely asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These larrikins&mdash;all  this noise and cackle&mdash;what&rsquo;s the meaning of it?&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty asked, spluttering  with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our guest house,&rdquo;  Splodge explained pointing to the multitude up in the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a chopper&mdash;I&rsquo;d  give them all a bump if I had,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about going up and  having some dinner?&rdquo; Splodge said soothingly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re  missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i>-go-up-there!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty gasped. &ldquo;Take my Snubby up there where  that bold cub of a Blinky is. Shame on you all,&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up and have some  dinner,&rdquo; Splodge repeated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to have a hop in the moonlight  afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh! How <i>scandalous!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty could hardly  speak with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the time of  your life,&rdquo; Splodge said, laughing at the top of his voice, and gradually  edging Mrs. Grunty and Snubby over towards the basket, without her noticing  what was happening.</p>
<p>Still arguing loudly and  protesting strongly about everything, Splodge managed to get her right up to  the edge of the basket, then without a beg pardon or gentle argument he gave  her and Snubby a quick push and head over heels the pair of them lay flat in  the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-hoy!&rdquo; Splodge yelled,  as he rushed out with the rope. Up shot the basket, yells and screams coming  from its occupants, while those in the tree all leaned out to see what the  noise was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stuck!&rdquo; Blinky  called at the top of his voice, and stuck she was.</p>
<p>In mid-air the basket  was rocking violently, while Mrs. Grunty walloped about inside, only making the  basket swing more dangerously, as she clawed at one side and then the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; Blinky  shouted, amid cheers and yells from the onlookers. One kookaburra had the  impudence to fly down and perch on the handle of the basket, laughing loudly as  it almost tumbled upside down. Mrs. Grunty made a wild lunge at the bird and  out she fell&mdash;but not altogether; her wild grabbing at the side of the basket  saved her from the final plunge to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;how dreadful. How  ghastly!&rdquo; she moaned as she flopped back into safety, and then to every one&rsquo;s  surprise fainted on top of Snubby.</p>
<p>Splodge in the meantime  worked terrifically with the rope. In his lightning-like rush he had tangled  the rope round a short tree and there it stuck, refusing to move until he  backed and whipped it loose. That was the sign for further excitement, for, as  the rope freed itself, the basket came with a rush down to earth again. &ldquo;Bump!&rdquo;  it landed. Snubby gave a little squeal and popped his head over the side, while  Mrs. Grunty gave a deep sigh and opened her eyes. The bump had bumped her back  into consciousness.</p>
<p>Splodge rushed over to  the basket and fanned Mrs. Grunty with a bunch of leaves, bringing the colour  back to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; she  snarled. &ldquo;Help me out of this trap at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every animal that could  climb down the tree came with amazing speed, and all rushed over to Mrs. Grunty.  Willing paws helped her to her feet, while Mrs. Koala waved a few of her very  best gum-tips under her friend&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>It had the desired  effect. Mrs. Grunty grabbed the leaves and ate them immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul!&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak! Please don&rsquo;t  address me,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty replied weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her home,&rdquo;  Splodge said to Mrs. Koala; but Mrs. Grunty overheard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such  thing,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cause of it all. And where&rsquo;s my Snubby?&rdquo; She  suddenly remembered her son.</p>
<p>Snubby was enjoying  himself at the moment, being made a great fuss of by Nutsy, who offered him as  many leaves as he could swallow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him stay for the  hop,&rdquo; Nutsy pleaded, as Mrs. Grunty ordered him home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;do!&rdquo; every one  begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the end of  him,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty sighed. &ldquo;The end of my discipline&mdash;the end of his childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala  said softly. &ldquo;Let him play with Nutsy, she&rsquo;s the sweetest little bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, very  well,&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty sighed. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d brought my knitting. It&rsquo;s a waste of  time sitting around and doing nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to  dance,&rdquo; Mrs. Koala replied with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Mrs. Grunty  remarked shortly. &ldquo;The very idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the frog  quartette were tuning up their drums and croakers, while Walter Wombat, who was  generally considered the finest band conductor in the bush, was sitting in a  corner all by himself, working up his deep gump, gump, gumps. Piping crickets  sounded their notes, and then, without further notice, a butcher bird started  to carol. That was the signal for all to commence. Walter Wombat sprang to his  feet. &ldquo;Gump&mdash;gump&mdash;gump,&rdquo; he grunted waving a stick in his front paws. Down it came  with a crash on a rock, splitting it to smithereens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pests and bothers!&rdquo; he  exclaimed, hastily grabbing another stick that lay at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whacko! Let her rip!&rdquo; he  shouted and once more raised his baton above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the  splinters!&rdquo; Blinky shouted; but Mr. Walter Wombat was too much of a gentleman  to even pretend he heard this rude remark. The band started. Every one jumped  to his feet, grabbing the partner who happened to be nearest. Then as the music  suddenly changed into &ldquo;The Teddy Bears&rsquo; Picnic&rdquo;, laughs and shouts started the  greatest and happiest dance ever seen in the bush. Round and round the foot of  the old gum-tree the animals danced, hopped and flew. Old Mr. Wombat grabbed Mrs.  Grunty before she had time to protest, and Splodge rubbed his eyes to make sure  he was seeing correctly when he spied these two fox-trotting, if you please. Mrs.  Koala waltzed with Mr. Kangaroo, or tried to. His big feet <i>would</i> get in the way until he ended up by seizing her around the  waist and whirling around with her in mid-air. Splodge danced with Mrs. Wallaby  and caused quite a sensation when both of them exhibited new steps to the  audience. Splodge explained that the new dance was called &ldquo;The Zoo Rush&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nutsy danced with  Snubby, until Blinky butted in and then all three decided to have a dance on  their own. On the outskirts of the other dancers, these three little bears  tumbled and hopped, laughed and pranced, until Mrs. Koala and Mrs. Grunty  joined in. Alone the little bears danced, and if ever you&rsquo;ve tried to imagine a  teddy bears&rsquo; picnic, just close your eyes for a moment at present, turn on the  music of that famous melody and you just can&rsquo;t help seeing them as plain as  daylight. The dear little cuddly bears.</p>
<p>This happy dance was the  means of many bush friendships being made, and more important still it was the  cause of Mrs. Grunty becoming quite gay and hospitable. Ever after, she and  Snubby paid regular visits to Mrs. Koala, while Blinky and Nutsy were overjoyed  to have another playmate. The last peep I had of Blinky before I left the bush,  was to see him instructing Snubby how to use a catapult, and Nutsy how to make  frogs hop when they didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
