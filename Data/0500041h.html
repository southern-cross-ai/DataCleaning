<h2>SCENE I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Sunday morning. Market-place of a large mining village in
the Midlands. A man addressing a small gang of colliers from the
foot of a stumpy memorial obelisk. Church bells heard.
Churchgoers passing along the outer pavements.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>WILLIE HOUGHTON: What's the matter with you folks, as I've
told you before, and as I shall keep on telling you every now and
again, though it doesn't make a bit of difference, is that you've
got no idea of freedom whatsoever. I've lived in this blessed
place for fifty years, and I've never seen the spark of an idea,
nor of any response to an idea, come out of a single one of you,
all the time. I don't know what it is with colliers--whether it's
spending so much time in the bowels of the earth--but they never
seem to be able to get their thoughts above their bellies. If
you've got plenty to eat and drink, and a bit over to keep the
missis quiet, you're satisfied. I never saw such a satisfied
bloomin' lot in my life as you Barlow and Walsall's men are,
really. Of course you can growse as well as anybody, and you do
growse. But you don't do anything else. You're stuck in a sort of
mud of contentment, and you feel yourselves sinking, but you make
no efforts to get out. You bleat a bit, like sheep in a bog--but
you like it, you know. You like sinking in--you don't have to
stand on your own feet then.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what'll happen to you chaps. I'll give you a
little picture of what you'll be like in the future. Barlow and
Walsall's 'll make a number of compounds, such as they keep
niggers in in South Africa, and there you'll be kept. And every
one of you'll have a little brass collar round his neck, with a
number on it. You won't have names any more. And you'll go from
the compound to the pit, and from the pit back again to the
compound. You won't be allowed to go outside the gates, except at
weekends. They'll let you go home to your wives on Saturday
nights, to stop over Sunday. But you'll have to be in again by
half-past nine on Sunday night; and if you're late, you'll have
your next week-end knocked off. And there you'll be--and you'll
be quite happy. They'll give you plenty to eat, and a can of beer
a day, and a bit of bacca--and they'll provide dominoes and
skittles for you to play with. And you'll be the most contented
set of men alive.--But you won't be men. You won't even be
animals. You'll go from number one to number three thousand, a
lot of numbered slaves--a new sort of slaves--</p>

<p>VOICE: An' wheer shall thee be, Willie?</p>

<p>WILLIE: Oh, I shall be outside the palings, laughing at you. I
shall have to laugh, because it'll be your own faults. You'll
have nobody but yourself to thank for it. You don't <i>want</i>
to be men. You'd rather <i>not</i> be free--much rather. You're
like those people spoken of in Shakespeare: "Oh, how eager these
men are to be slaves!" I believe it's Shakespeare--or the
Bible--one or the other--it mostly is--</p>

<p>ANABEL WRATH (<i>passing to church</i>): It was Tiberius.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Eh?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Tiberius said it.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Tiberius!--Oh, did he? (<i>Laughs.</i>) Thanks! Well,
if Tiberius said it, there must be something in it. And he only
just missed being in the Bible, anyway. He was a day late, or
they'd have had him in. "Oh, how eager these men are to be
slaves!"--It's evident the Romans deserved all they got from
Tiberius--and you'll deserve all you get, every bit of it. But
don't you bother, you'll get it. You won't be at the mercy of
Tiberius, you'll be at the mercy of something a jolly sight
worse. Tiberius took the skin off a few Romans, apparently. But
you'll have the soul taken out of you--every one of you. And I'd
rather lose my skin than my soul, any day. But perhaps you
wouldn't.</p>

<p>VOICE: What art makin' for, Willie? Tha seems to say a lot,
but tha goes round it. Tha'rt like a donkey on a gin. Tha gets
ravelled.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Yes, that's just it. I am precisely like a donkey on a
gin--a donkey that's trying to wind a lot of colliers up to the
surface. There's many a donkey that's brought more colliers than
you up to see daylight, by trotting round.--But do you want to
know what I'm making for? I can soon tell you that. You Barlow
and Walsall's men, you haven't a soul to call your own. Barlow
and Walsall's have only to say to one of you, Come, and he
cometh; Go, and he goeth, Lie down and be kicked, and he lieth
down and he <i>is</i> kicked--and serve him jolly well right.</p>

<p>VOICE: Ay--an' what about it? Tha's got a behind o' thy own,
hasn't ter?</p>

<p>WILLIE: Do you stand there and ask me what about it, and
haven't the sense to alter it? Couldn't you set up a proper
Government to-morrow, if you liked? Couldn't you contrive that
the pits belonged to you, instead of you belonging to the pits,
like so many old pit-ponies that stop down till they are blind,
and take to eating coal-slack for meadow-grass, not knowing the
difference? If only you'd learn to think, I'd respect you. As you
are, I can't, not if I try my hardest. All you can think of is to
ask for another shilling a day. That's as far as your imagination
carries you. And perhaps you get sevenpence ha'penny, but pay for
it with half a crown's worth of sweat. The masters aren't
fools--as you are. They'll give you two-thirds of what you ask
for, but they'll get five-thirds of it back again--and they'll
get it out of your flesh and blood, too, in jolly hard work.
Shylock wasn't in it with them. He only wanted a pound of flesh.
But you cheerfully give up a pound a week, each one of you, and
keep on giving it up.--But you don't seem to see these things.
You can't think beyond your dinners and your 'lowance. You think
if you can get another shilling a day you're set up. You make me
tired, I tell you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR FREER: We think of others besides ourselves.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Hello, Job Arthur--are you there? I didn't recognise
you without your frock-coat and silk hat--on the Sabbath.--What
was that you said? You think of something else, besides
yourselves?--Oh ay--I'm glad to hear it. Did you mean your own
importance?</p>

<p><i>A motor car,</i> GERALD BARLOW <i>driving,</i> OLIVER
TURTON <i>with him, has pulled up.</i></p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR (<i>glancing at the car</i>): No, I didn't.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, let us have it.
The more the merrier. You were going to say something.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Nay, you were doing the talking.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Yes, so I was, till you interrupted, with a great idea
on the tip of your tongue. Come, spit it out. No matter if Mr
Barlow hears you. You know how sorry for you we feel, that you've
always got to make your speeches twice--once to those above, and
once to us here below. I didn't mean the angels and the devils,
but never mind. Speak up, Job Arthur.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: It's not everybody as has as much to say as you,
Mr Houghton.</p>

<p>WILLIE: No, not in the open--that's a fact. Some folks says a
great deal more, in semi-private. You were just going to explain
to me, on behalf of the men, whom you so ably represent and so
wisely lead, Job Arthur--we won't say by the nose--you were just
going to tell me--on behalf of the men, of course, not of the
masters--that you think of others, besides yourself. Do you mind
explaining <i>what</i> others?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Everybody's used to your talk, Mr Houghton, and
for that reason it doesn't make much impression. What I meant to
say, in plain words, was that we have to think of what's best for
everybody, not only for ourselves.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Oh, I see. What's best for everybody! I see! Well, for
myself, I'm much obliged--there's nothing for us to do,
gentlemen, but for all of us to bow acknowledgments to Mr Job
Arthur Freer, who so kindly has <i>all</i> our interests at
heart.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't profess to be a red-rag Socialist. I don't
pretend to think that if the Government had the pits it would be
any better for us. No. What I mean is, that the pits are there,
and every man on this place depends on them, one way or another.
They're the cow that gives the milk. And what I mean is, how
every man shall have a proper share of the milk, which is food
and living. I don't want to kill the cow and share up the meat.
It's like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. I want to
keep the cow healthy and strong. And the cow is the pits, and
we're the men that depend on the pits.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Who's the cat that's going to lick the cream?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: My position is this--and I state it before masters
and men--that it's our business to strike such a balance between
the interests of the men and the interests of the masters that
the pits remain healthy, and everybody profits.</p>

<p>WILLIE: You're out for the millennium, I can see--with Mr Job
Arthur Freer striking the balance. We all see you, Job Arthur,
one foot on either side of the fence, balancing the see-saw, with
masters at one end and men at the other. You'll have to give one
side a lot of pudding.--But go back a bit, to where we were
before the motor car took your breath away. When you said, Job
Arthur, that you think of others besides yourself, didn't you
mean, as a matter of fact, the office men? Didn't you mean that
the colliers, led--we won't mention noses--by you, were going to
come out in sympathy with the office clerks, supposing they
didn't get the rise in wages which they've asked for--the office
clerks? Wasn't that it?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: There's been some talk among the men of standing
by the office. I don't know what they'll do. But they'll do it of
their own decision, whatever it is.</p>

<p>WILLIE: There's not a shadow of doubt about it, Job Arthur.
But it's a funny thing the decisions all have the same foxy smell
about them, Job Arthur.</p>

<p>OLIVER TURTON (<i>calling from the car</i>): What was the
speech about, in the first place?</p>

<p>WILLIE: I beg pardon?</p>

<p>OLIVER: What was the address about, to begin with?</p>

<p>WILLIE: Oh, the same old hat--Freedom. But partly it's given
to annoy the Unco Guid, as they pass to their Sabbath banquet of
self-complacency.</p>

<p>OLIVER: What <i>about</i> Freedom?</p>

<p>WILLIE: Very much as usual, I believe. But you should have
been here ten minutes sooner, before we began to read the
lessons. (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>ANABEL W. (<i>moving forward, and holding out her hand</i>):
You'd merely have been told what Freedom <i>isn't</i>: and you
know that already. How are you, Oliver?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Good God, Anabel!--are you part of the meeting? How
long have you been back in England?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Some months, now. My family have moved here, you
know.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Your family! Where have they moved from?--from the
moon?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, only from Derby.--How are you, Gerald?</p>

<p>GERALD <i>twists in his seat to give her his hand.</i></p>

<p>GERALD: I saw you before.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I know you did.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR <i>has disappeared. The men disperse sheepishly
into groups, to stand and sit on their heels by the walls and the
causeway edge.</i> WILLIE HOUGHTON <i>begins to talk to
individuals.</i></p>

<p>OLIVER: Won't you get in and drive on with us a little
way?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, I was going to church.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Going to church! Is that a new habit?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Not a habit. But I've been twice since I saw you
last.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I see. And that's nearly two years ago. It's an annual
thing, like a birthday?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No. I'll go on, then.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You'll be late now.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Shall I? It doesn't matter.</p>

<p>OLIVER: We are going to see you again, aren't we?</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>after a pause</i>): Yes, I hope so, Oliver.</p>

<p>OLIVER: How have you been these two years--well?--happy?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, neither. How have you?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, fairly happy. Have you been ill?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, in France I was very ill.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Your old neuritis?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No. My chest. Pneumonia--oh, a complication.</p>

<p>OLIVER: How sickening! Who looked after you? Is it better?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, it's a great deal better.</p>

<p>OLIVER: And what are you doing in England--working?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, not much.--I won't keep the car here:
good-bye.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, it's alright.</p>

<p>OLIVER: But, Anabel--we must fix a meeting. I say, wait just a
moment. Could I call on your people? Go into town with me one
day. I don't know whether Gerald intends to see you--whether he
intends to ask you to Lilley Close.</p>

<p>GERALD: I--</p>

<p>ANABEL: He's no need. I'm fixed up there already.</p>

<p>GERALD: What do you mean?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I am at Lilley Close every day--or most days--to work
with your sister Winifred in the studio.</p>

<p>GERALD: What?--why, how's that?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Your father asked me. My father was already giving her
some lessons.</p>

<p>GERALD: And you're at our house every day?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Most days.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well, I'm--well, I'll be--you managed it very sharp,
didn't you? I've only been away a fortnight.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Your father asked me--he offered me twelve pounds a
month--I wanted to do something.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh yes, but you didn't hire yourself out at Lilley
Close as a sort of upper servant just for twelve pounds a
month.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You're wrong--you're wrong. I'm not a sort of upper
servant at all--not at all.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh yes, you are, if you're paid twelve pounds a
month--three pounds a week. That's about what Father's sick-nurse
gets, I believe. You're a kind of upper servant, like a nurse.
You don't do it for twelve pounds a month. You can make twelve
pounds in a day, if you like to work at your little models: I
know you can sell your little statuette things as soon as you
make them.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But I <i>can't</i> make them. I <i>can't</i> make
them. I've lost the spirit--the <i>joie de vivre</i>--I don't
know what, since I've been ill. I tell you I've <i>got</i> to
earn something.</p>

<p>GERALD: Nevertheless, you won't make me believe, Anabel, that
you've come and buried yourself in the provinces--<i>such</i>
provinces--just to earn Father's three pounds a week. Why don't
you admit it, that you came back to try and take up the old
threads?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Why not, Gerald? Don't you think we ought to take up
the old threads?</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't think we ought to be left without choice. I
don't think Anabel ought to come back and thrust herself on
me--for that's what it amounts to, after all--when one remembers
what's gone before.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I <i>don't</i> thrust myself on you at all. I know I'm
a fool, a fool, to come back. But I wanted to. I wanted to see
you again. Now I know I've presumed. I've made myself
<i>cheap</i> to you. I wanted to--I wanted to. And now I've done
it, I won't come to Lilley Close again, nor anywhere where you
are. Tell your father I have gone to France again--it will be
true.</p>

<p>GERALD: You play tricks on me--and on yourself. You know you
do. You do it for the pure enjoyment of it. You're making a scene
here in this filthy market-place, just for the fun of it. You
like to see these accursed colliers standing eyeing you, and
squatting on their heels. You like to catch me out, here where
I'm known, where I've been the object of their eyes since I was
born. This is a great <i>coup de main</i> for you. I knew it the
moment I saw you here.</p>

<p>OLIVER: After all, we <i>are</i> making a scene in the
market-place. Get in, Anabel, and we'll settle the dispute more
privately. I'm glad you came back, anyhow. I'm glad you came
right down on us. Get in, and let us run down to Whatmore.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, Oliver. I don't want to run down to Whatmore. I
wanted to see you--I wanted to see Gerald--and I've seen him--and
I've heard him. That will suffice me. We'll make an end of the
scene in the market-place. (<i>She turns away.</i>)</p>

<p>OLIVER: I knew it wasn't ended. I knew she would come back and
tell us she'd come. But she's done her bit--now she'll go again.
My God, what a fool of a world!--You go on, Gerald--I'll just go
after her and see it out. (<i>Calls.</i>)One moment, Anabel.</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>calling</i>): Don't come, Oliver.
(<i>Turns.</i>)</p>

<p>GERALD: Anabel! (<i>Blows the horn of the motor car violently
and agitatedly--she looks round--turns again as if
frightened.</i>) God damn the woman! (<i>Gets down from the
car.</i>) Drive home for me, Oliver.</p>

<p>CURTAIN</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>SCENE II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WINIFRED'S <i>studio at Lilley Close.</i> ANABEL <i>and</i>
WINIFRED <i>working at a model in clay.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>WINIFRED: But isn't it lovely to be in Paris, and to have
exhibitions, and to be famous?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Paris <i>was</i> a good place. But I was never
famous.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: But your little animals and birds were famous. Jack
said so. You know he brought us that bronze thrush that is
singing, that is in his room. He has only let me see it twice.
It's the loveliest thing I've ever seen. Oh, if I can do anything
like that!--I've worshipped it, I have. Is it your best
thing?</p>

<p>ANABEL: One of the best.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: It must be. When I see it, with its beak lifted,
singing, something comes loose in my heart, and I feel as if I
should cry, and fly up to heaven. Do you know what I mean? Oh,
I'm sure you do, or you could never have made that thrush. Father
is so glad you've come to show me how to work. He says now I
shall have a life-work, and I shall be happy. It's true, too.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, till the life-work collapses.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oh, it can't collapse. I can't believe it could
collapse. Do tell me about something else you made, which you
loved--something you sculpted. Oh, it makes my heart burn to hear
you!--Do you think I might call you Anabel? I should love to. You
do call me Winifred already.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, do.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Won't you tell me about something else you
made--something lovely?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Well, I did a small kitten--asleep--with its paws
crossed. You know, Winifred, that wonderful look that kittens
have, as if they were blown along like a bit of fluff--as if they
weighed nothing at all--just wafted about--and yet so
<i>alive</i>--do you know--?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Darlings--darlings--I love them!</p>

<p>ANABEL: Well, my kitten really came off--it had that quality.
It looked as if it had just wafted there.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oh, yes!--oh, I know! And was it in clay?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I cut it in soft grey stone as well. I loved my
kitten. An Armenian bought her.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: And where is she now?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't know--in Armenia, I suppose, if there is such
a place. It would have to be kept under glass, because the stone
wouldn't polish--and I didn't want it polished. But I dislike
things under glass--don't you?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes, I do. We had a golden clock, but Gerald
wouldn't have the glass cover, and Daddy wouldn't have it
without. So now the clock is in Father's room. Gerald often went
to Paris. Oliver used to have a studio there. I don't care much
for painting--do you?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No. I want something I can touch, if it's something
outside me.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes, isn't it wonderful, when things are
substantial. Gerald and Oliver came back yesterday from
Yorkshire. You know we have a colliery there.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I believe I've heard.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: I want to introduce you to Gerald, to see if you
like him. He's good at the bottom, but he's very overbearing and
definite.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Is he?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Terribly clever in business. He'll get awfully
rich.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Isn't he rich enough already?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oh yes, because Daddy is rich enough, really. I
think if Gerald was a bit different, he'd be really nice. Now
he's so <i>managing.</i> It's sickening. Do you dislike managing
people, Anabel?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I dislike them extremely, Winifred.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: They're such a bore.</p>

<p>ANABEL: What does Gerald manage?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Everything. You know he's revolutionized the
collieries and the whole Company. He's made a whole new thing of
it, so <i>modern.</i> Father says he almost wishes he'd let it
die out--let the pits be closed. But I suppose things <i>must</i>
be modernized, don't you think? Though it's very unpeaceful, you
know, really.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Decidedly unpeaceful, I should say.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: The colliers work awfully hard. The pits are quite
wonderful now. Father says it's against nature--all this
electricity and so on. Gerald adores electricity. Isn't it
curious?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Very. How are you getting on?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: I don't know. It's so hard to make things
<i>balance</i> as if they were alive. Where <i>is</i> the balance
in a thing that's alive?</p>

<p>ANABEL: The poise? Yes, Winifred--to me, all the secret of
life is in that--just the--the inexpressible poise of a living
thing, that makes it so different from a dead thing. To me it's
the soul, you know--all living things have it--flowers, trees as
well. It makes life always marvellous.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Ah, yes!--ah, yes! If only I could put it in my
model.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I think you will. You are a sculptor, Winifred.--Isn't
there someone there?</p>

<p>WINIFRED (<i>running to the door</i>): Oh, Oliver!</p>

<p>OLIVER: Hello, Winnie! Can I come in? This is your sanctum:
you can keep us out if you like.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oh, no. Do you know Miss Wrath, Oliver? She's a
famous sculptress.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Is she? We have met.--Is Winifred going to make a
sculptress, do you think?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I do.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Good! I like your studio, Winnie. Awfully nice up here
over the out-buildings. Are you happy in it?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes, I'm perfectly happy--only I shall <i>never</i>
be able to make real models, Oliver--it's so difficult.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Fine room for a party--give us a studio party one day,
Win, and we'll dance.</p>

<p>WINIFRED (<i>flying to him</i>): Yes, Oliver, do let us dance.
What shall we dance to?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Dance?--Dance <i>Vigni-vignons</i>--we all know that.
Ready?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes.</p>

<p><i>They begin to sing, dancing meanwhile, in a free little
ballet-manner, a wine-dance, dancing separate and then
together.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>De terre en vigne<br>
 La voil&agrave; la jolie vigne,<br>
 Vigni-vignons--vignons le vin,<br>
 La voil&agrave; la jolie vigne au vin,<br>
 La voil&agrave; la jolie vigne.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>OLIVER: Join in--join in, all.</p>

<p>ANABEL <i>joins in; the three dance and move in
rhythm.</i></p>

<p>WINIFRED: I love it--I love it! Do <i>Ma capote &agrave; trois
boutons</i>--you know it, don't you, Anabel? Ready--now--</p>

<p><i>They begin to dance to a quick little march-rhythm, all
singing and dancing till they are out of breath.</i></p>

<p>OLIVER: Oh!--tired!--let us sit down.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oliver!--oh, Oliver!--I <i>love</i> you and
Anabel.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Oh, Winifred, I brought you a present--you'll love me
more now.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes, I shall. Do give it me.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I left it in the morning-room. I put it on the
mantelpiece for you.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Shall I go for it?</p>

<p>OLIVER: There it is, if you want it.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes--do you mind? I won't be long.</p>

<p>WINIFRED <i>goes out.</i></p>

<p>OLIVER: She's a nice child.</p>

<p>ANABEL: A <i>very</i> nice child.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Why did you come back, Anabel?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why does the moon rise, Oliver?</p>

<p>OLIVER: For some mischief or other, so they say.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You think I came back for mischief's sake?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Did you?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Ah!</p>

<p>ANABEL: Tell me, Oliver, how is everything now?--how is it
with you?--how is it between us all?</p>

<p>OLIVER: How is it between us all?--How <i>isn't</i> it, is
more the mark.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why?</p>

<p>OLIVER: You made a fool of us.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Of whom?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Well--of Gerald particularly--and of me.</p>

<p>ANABEL: How did I make a fool of you, Oliver?</p>

<p>OLIVER: That you know best, Anabel.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, I don't know. Was it ever right between Gerald and
me, all the three years we knew each other--we were together?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Was it all wrong?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, not all. But it was terrible. It was terrible,
Oliver. You don't realize. You don't realize how awful passion
can be, when it never resolves, when it never becomes anything
else. It is hate, really.</p>

<p>OLIVER: What did you want the passion to resolve into?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I was blinded--maddened. Gerald stung me and stung me
till I was mad. I left him for reason's sake, for sanity's sake.
We should have killed one another.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You stung him too, you know--and pretty badly, at the
last: you dehumanized him.</p>

<p>ANABEL: When? When I left him, you mean?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, when you went away with that Norwegian--playing
your game a little too far.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I knew you'd blame me. I knew you'd be against
me. But don't you see, Oliver, you helped to make it impossible
for us.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Did I? I didn't intend to.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Ha, ha, Oliver! Your good intentions! They are too
good to bear investigation, my friend. Ah, but for your good and
friendly intentions--</p>

<p>OLIVER: You might have been alright?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, no, I don't mean that. But we were a vicious
triangle, Oliver--you must admit it.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You mean my friendship with Gerald went against
you?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes. And your friendship with me went against
Gerald.</p>

<p>OLIVER: So I am the devil in the piece.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You see, Oliver, Gerald loved you far too well ever to
love me altogether. He loved us both. But the Gerald that loved
you so dearly, old, old friends as you were, and <i>trusted</i>
you, he turned a terrible face of contempt on me. You don't know,
Oliver, the cold edge of Gerald's contempt for me--because he was
so secure and strong in his old friendship with you. You don't
know his sneering attitude to me in the deepest things--because
he shared the deepest things with you. He had a passion for me.
But he loved you.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Well, he doesn't any more. We went apart after you had
gone. The friendship has become almost casual.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You see how bitterly you speak.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yet you didn't hate me, Anabel.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, Oliver--I was <i>awfully</i> fond of you. I
trusted you--and I trust you still. You see I knew how fond
Gerald was of you. And I had to respect this feeling. So I
<i>had</i> to be aware of you: I <i>had</i> to be conscious of
you: in a way, I had to love you. You understand how I mean? Not
with the same fearful love with which I loved Gerald. You seemed
to me warm and protecting--like a brother, you know--but a
brother one <i>loves.</i></p>

<p>OLIVER: And then you hated me?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I had to hate you.</p>

<p>OLIVER: And you hated Gerald?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Almost to madness--almost to madness.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Then you went away with that Norwegian. What of
him?</p>

<p>ANABEL: What of him? Well, he's dead.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Ah! That's why you came back?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, no. I came back because my only hope in life was
in coming back. Baard was beautiful--and awful. You know how
glisteningly blond he was. Oliver, have you ever watched the
polar bears? He was cold as iron when it is so cold that it burns
you. Coldness wasn't negative with him. It was positive--and
awful beyond expression--like the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I wonder you ever got back.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, so do I. I feel as if I'd fallen down a fissure
in the ice. Yet I have come back, haven't I?</p>

<p>OLIVER: God knows! At least, Anabel, we've gone through too
much ever to start the old game again. There'll be no more sticky
love between us.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, I think there won't, either.</p>

<p>OLIVER: And what of Gerald?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't know. What do you think of him?</p>

<p>OLIVER: I can't think any more. I can only blindly go from day
to day, now.</p>

<p>ANABEL: So can I. Do you think I was wrong to come back? Do
you think I wrong Gerald?</p>

<p>OLIVER: No. I'm glad you came. But I feel I can't <i>know</i>
anything. We must just go on.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Sometimes I feel I ought never to have come to Gerald
again--never--never--never.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Just left the gap?--Perhaps, if everything has to come
asunder. But I think, if ever there is to be life--hope,--then
you had to come back. I always knew it. There is something
eternal between you and him; and if there is to be any happiness,
it depends on that. But perhaps there is to <i>be</i> no more
happiness--for our part of the world.</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>after a pause</i>): Yet I feel hope--don't you?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, sometimes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: It seemed to me, especially that winter in Norway,--I
can hardly express it,--as if any moment life might give way
under one, like thin ice, and one would be more than dead. And
then I knew my only hope was here--the only hope.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, I believe it. And I believe--</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> MRS BARLOW.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Oh, I wanted to speak to you, Oliver.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Shall I come across?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: No, not now. I believe Father is coming here with
Gerald.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Is he going to walk so far?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: He will do it.--I suppose you know Oliver?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, we have met before.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW (<i>to</i> OLIVER): You didn't mention it. Where
have you met Miss Wrath? She's been about the world, I
believe.</p>

<p>ANABEL: About the world?--no, Mrs Barlow. If one happens to
know Paris and London--</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Paris and London! Well, I don't say you are
altogether an adventuress. My husband seems very pleased with
you--for Winifred's sake, I suppose--and he's wrapped up in
Winifred.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Winifred is an artist.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: All my children have the artist in them. They get
it from my family. My father went mad in Rome. My family is born
with a black fate--they all inherit it.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I believe one is master of one's fate sometimes, Mrs
Barlow. There are moments of pure choice.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Between two ways to the same end, no doubt.
There's no changing the end.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I think there is.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Yes, you have a <i>parvenu's</i> presumptuousness
somewhere about you.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Well, better than a blue-blooded fatalism.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: The fate is in the blood: you can't change the
blood.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> WINIFRED.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Oh, thank you, Oliver, for the wolf and the goat,
thank you so much!--The wolf has sprung on the goat, Miss Wrath,
and has her by the throat.</p>

<p>ANABEL: The wolf?</p>

<p>OLIVER: It's a little marble group--Italian--in hard
marble.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: The wolf--I love the wolf--he pounces so
beautifully. His backbone is so terribly fierce. I don't feel a
bit sorry for the goat, somehow.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I didn't. She is too much like the wrong sort of
clergyman.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Yes--such a stiff, long face. I wish he'd kill
her.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: There's a wish!</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Father and Gerald are coming. That's them, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> MR BARLOW <i>and</i> GERALD.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, good morning--good morning--quite a little
gathering! Ah--</p>

<p>OLIVER: The steps tire you, Mr Barlow.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: A little--a little--thank you.--Well, Miss Wrath,
are you quite comfortable here?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Very comfortable, thanks.</p>

<p>GERALD: It was clever of you, Father, to turn this place into
a studio.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, Gerald. You make the worldly schemes and I the
homely. Yes, it's a delightful place. I shall come here often if
the two young ladies will allow me.--By the way, Miss Wrath, I
don't know if you have been introduced to my son Gerald. I beg
your pardon. Miss Wrath, Gerald--my son, Miss Wrath. (<i>They
bow.</i>) Well, we are quite a gathering, quite a pleasant little
gathering. We never expected anything so delightful a month ago,
did we, Winifred, darling?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: No, Daddy, it's much nicer than expectations.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: So it is, dear--to have such exceptional
companionship and such a pleasant retreat. We are very happy to
have Miss Wrath with us--very happy.</p>

<p>GERALD: A studio's awfully nice, you know; it is such a
retreat. A newspaper has no effect in it--falls quite flat, no
matter what the headlines are.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Quite true, Gerald, dear. It is a sanctum the world
cannot invade--unlike all other sanctuaries, I am afraid.</p>

<p>GERALD: By the way, Oliver--to go back to profanities--the
colliers really are coming out in support of the poor, ill-used
clerks.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: No, no, Gerald--no, no! Don't be such an alarmist.
Let us leave these subjects before the ladies. No, no: the clerks
will have their increase quite peacefully.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, dear father--but they can't have it peacefully
now. We've been threatened already by the colliers--we've already
received an ultimatum.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Nonsense, my boy--nonsense! Don't let us split
words. You won't go against the clerks in such a small matter.
Always avoid trouble over small matters. Don't make bad
feeling--don't make bad blood.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: The blood is already rotten in this neighbourhood.
What it needs is letting out. We need a few veins opening, or we
shall have mortification setting in. The blood is black.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: We won't accept your figure of speech literally,
dear. No, Gerald, don't go to war over trifles.</p>

<p>GERALD: It's just over trifles that one must make war, Father.
One can yield gracefully over big matters. But to be bullied over
trifles is a sign of criminal weakness.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, not so, not so, my boy. When you are as old as
I am, you will know the comparative insignificance of these
trifles.</p>

<p>GERALD: The older <i>I</i> get, Father, the more such trifles
stick in my throat.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, it is an increasingly irritable disposition in
you, my child. Nothing costs so bitterly, in the end, as a
stubborn pride.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Except a stubborn humility--and that will cost you
more. Avoid humility, beware of stubborn humility: it degrades.
Hark, Gerald--fight! When the occasion comes, fight! If it's one
against five thousand, fight! Don't give them your heart on a
dish! Never! If they want to eat your heart out, make them fight
for it, and then give it them poisoned at last, poisoned with
your own blood.--What do you say, young woman?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Is it for me to speak, Mrs Barlow?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Weren't you asked?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Certainly I would <i>never</i> give the world my heart
on a dish. But can't there ever be peace--real peace?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: No--not while there is devilish enmity.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: You are wrong, dear, you are wrong. The peace can
come, the peace that passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: That there is already between me and Almighty God.
I am at peace with the God that made me, and made me proud. With
men who humiliate me I am at war. Between me and the shameful
humble there is war to the end, though they are millions and I am
one. I hate the people. Between my race and them there is
war--between them and me, between them and my children--for ever
war, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, Henrietta--you have said all this before.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: And say it again. Fight, Gerald. You have my blood
in you, thank God. Fight for it, Gerald. Spend it as if it were
costly, Gerald, drop by drop. Let no dogs lap it.--Look at your
father. He set his heart on a plate at the door, for the poorest
mongrel to eat up. See him now, wasted and crossed out like a
mistake--and swear, Gerald, swear to be true to my blood in you.
Never lie down before the mob, Gerald. Fight it and stab it, and
die fighting. It's a lost hope--but fight!</p>

<p>GERALD: Don't say these things here, Mother.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Yes, I will--I will. I'll say them before you, and
the child Winifred--she knows. And before Oliver and the young
woman--they know, too.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: You see, dear, you can never understand that,
although I am weak and wasted, although I may be crossed out from
the world like a mistake, I still have peace in my soul, dear,
the peace that passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: And what right have you to it? All very well for
you to take peace with you into the other world. What do you
leave for your sons to inherit?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: The peace of God, Henrietta, if there is no peace
among men.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Then why did you have children? Why weren't you
celibate? They have to live among men. If they have no place
among men, why have you put them there? If the peace of God is no
more than the peace of death, why are your sons born of you? How
can you have peace with God, if you leave no peace for your
sons--no peace, no pride, no place on earth?</p>

<p>GERALD: Nay, Mother, nay. You shall never blame Father on my
behalf.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Don't trouble--he is blameless--I, a hulking,
half-demented woman, I am <i>glad</i> when you blame me. But
don't blame me when I tell you to fight. Don't do that, or you
will regret it when you must die. Ah, your father was stiff and
proud enough before men of better rank than himself. He was
overbearing enough with his equals and his betters. But he
humbled himself before the poor, he made me ashamed. He must hear
it--he must hear it! Better he should hear it than die coddling
himself with peace. His humility, and my pride, they have made a
nice ruin of each other. Yet he is the man I wanted to marry--he
is the man I would marry again. But never, never again would I
give way before his goodness. Gerald, if you must be true to your
father, be true to me as well. Don't set me down at nothing
because I haven't a humble case.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, Mother--no, dear Mother. You see, dear Mother, I
have rather a job between the two halves of myself. When you come
to have the wild horses in your own soul, Mother, it makes it
difficult.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Never mind, you'll have help.</p>

<p>GERALD: Thank you for the assurance, darling.--Father, you
don't mind what Mother says, I hope. I believe there's some truth
in it--don't you?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: I have nothing to say.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: <i>I</i> think there's some truth in it, Daddy. You
were always worrying about those horrid colliers, and they didn't
care a bit about you. And they <i>ought</i> to have cared a
million pounds.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: You don't understand, my child.</p>

<h1><a name="#a02">ACT II</a></h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>SCENE: <i>Evening of the same day. Drawing-room at Lilley
Close.</i> MR BARLOW, GERALD, WINIFRED, ANABEL, OLIVER
<i>present.</i> BUTLER <i>pours coffee.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>MR BARLOW: And you are quite a stranger in these parts, Miss
Wrath?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Practically. But I was born at Derby.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: I was born in this house--but it was a different
affair then: my father was a farmer, you know. The coal has
brought us what moderate wealth we have. Of course, we were never
poor or needy--farmers, substantial farmers. And I think we were
happier so--yes.--Winnie, dear, hand Miss Wrath the sweets. I
hope they're good. I ordered them from London for you.--Oliver,
my boy, have you everything you like? That's right.--It gives me
such pleasure to see a little festive gathering in this room
again. I wish Bertie and Elinor might be here. What time is it,
Gerald?</p>

<p>GERALD: A quarter to nine, Father.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Not late yet. I can sit with you another half-hour.
I am feeling better to-day. Winifred, sing something to us.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Something jolly, Father?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Very jolly, darling.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: I'll sing "The Lincolnshire Poacher", shall I?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Do, darling, and we'll all join in the
chorus.--Will you join in the chorus, Miss Wrath?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I will. It is a good song.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, isn't it!</p>

<p>WINIFRED: All dance for the chorus, as well as singing.</p>

<p><i>They sing; some pirouette a little for the chorus.</i></p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, splendid, splendid! There is nothing like
gaiety.</p>

<p>WINIFRED: I do love to dance about. I know: let us do a little
ballet--four of us--oh, do!</p>

<p>GERALD: What ballet, Winifred?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Any. Eva can play for us. She plays well.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: You won't disturb your mother? Don't disturb Eva if
she is busy with your mother.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> WINIFRED.</p>

<p>If only I can see Winifred happy, my heart is at rest: if only
I can hope for her to be happy in her life.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, Winnie's alright, Father--especially now she has
Miss Wrath to initiate her into the mysteries of life and
labour.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why are you ironical?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Oh, Miss Wrath, believe me, we all feel that--it is
the greatest possible pleasure to me that you have come.</p>

<p>GERALD: I wasn't ironical, I assure you.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: No, indeed--no, indeed! We have every belief in
you.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But why should you have?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Ah, my dear child, allow us the credit of our own
discernment. And don't take offence at my familiarity. I am
afraid I am spoilt since I am an invalid.</p>

<p><i>Re-enter</i> WINIFRED, <i>with</i> EVA.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Come, Eva, you will excuse us for upsetting your
evening. Will you be so good as to play something for us to dance
to?</p>

<p>EVA: Yes, sir. What shall I play?</p>

<p>WINIFRED: Mozart--I'll find you the piece. Mozart's the
saddest musician in the world--but he's the best to dance to.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Why, how is it you are such a connoisseur in
sadness, darling?</p>

<p>GERALD: She isn't. She's a flagrant amateur.</p>

<p>EVA <i>plays; they dance a little ballet.</i></p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Charming--charming, Miss Wrath: will you allow me
to say <i>Anabel,</i> we shall all feel so much more at home?
Yes--thank you--er--you enter into the spirit of it wonderfully,
Anabel, dear. The others are accustomed to play together. But it
is not so easy to come in on occasion as you do.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, Anabel's a genius!--I beg your pardon, Miss
Wrath--familiarity is catching.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Gerald, my boy, don't forget that you are virtually
host here.</p>

<p>EVA: Did you want any more music, sir?</p>

<p>GERALD: No, don't stay, Eva. We mustn't tire Father.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> EVA.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: I am afraid, Anabel, you will have a great deal to
excuse in us, in the way of manners. We have never been a formal
household. But you have lived in the world of artists: you will
understand, I hope.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Oh, surely--</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, I know. We have been a turbulent family, and
we have had our share of sorrow, even more, perhaps, than of
joys. And sorrow makes one indifferent to the conventionalities
of life.</p>

<p>GERALD: Excuse me, Father: do you mind if I go and write a
letter I have on my conscience?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: No, my boy. (<i>Exit</i> GERALD.) We have had our
share of sorrow and of conflict, Miss Wrath, as you may have
gathered.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes--a little.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: The mines were opened when my father was a boy--the
first--and I was born late, when he was nearly fifty. So that all
my life has been involved with coal and colliers. As a young man,
I was gay and thoughtless. But I married young, and we lost our
first child through a terrible accident. Two children we have
lost through sudden and violent death. (WINIFRED <i>goes out
unnoticed.</i>) It made me reflect. And when I came to reflect,
Anabel, I could not justify my position in life. If I believed in
the teachings of the New Testament--which I did, and do--how
could I keep two or three thousand men employed underground in
the mines, at a wage, let us say, of two pounds a week, whilst I
lived in this comfortable house, and took something like two
thousand pounds a year--let us name any figure--</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, of course. But is it money that really matters,
Mr Barlow?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: My dear, if you are a working man, it matters. When
I went into the homes of my poor fellows, when they were ill or
had had accidents--then I knew it mattered. I knew that the great
disparity was wrong--even as we are taught that it is wrong.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I believe that the great disparity is a mistake.
But take their lives, Mr Barlow. Do you think they would
<i>live</i> more, if they had more money? Do you think the poor
live less than the rich?--is their life emptier?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Surely their lives would be better, Anabel.</p>

<p>OLIVER: All our lives would be better, if we hadn't to hang on
in the perpetual tug-of-war, like two donkeys pulling at one
carrot. The ghastly tension of possessions, and struggling for
possession, spoils life for everybody.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, I know now, as I knew then, that it was wrong.
But how to avoid the wrong? If I gave away the whole of my
income, it would merely be an arbitrary dispensation of charity.
The money would still be mine to give, and those that received it
would probably only be weakened instead of strengthened. And then
my wife was accustomed to a certain way of living, a certain
establishment. Had I any right to sacrifice her, without her
consent?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why, no!</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Again, if I withdrew from the Company, if I retired
on a small income, I knew that another man would automatically
take my place, and make it probably harder for the men.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Of course--while the system stands, if one makes
self-sacrifice one only panders to the system, makes it
fatter.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: One panders to the system--one panders to the
system. And so, you see, the problem is too much. One man cannot
alter or affect the system; he can only sacrifice himself to it.
Which is the worst thing probably that he can do.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Quite. But why feel guilty for the system?--everybody
supports it, the poor as much as the rich. If every rich man
withdrew from the system, the working classes and socialists
would keep it going, every man in the hope of getting rich
himself at last. It's the people that are wrong. They want the
system much more than the rich do--because they are much more
anxious to be rich--never having been rich, poor devils.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Just the system. So I decided at last that the best
way was to give every private help that lay in my power. I would
help my men individually and personally, wherever I could. Not
one of them came to me and went away unheard; and there was no
distress which could be alleviated that I did not try to
alleviate. Yet I am afraid that the greatest distress I never
heard of, the most distressed never came to me. They hid their
trouble.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, the decent ones.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: But I wished to help--it was my duty. Still, I
think that, on the whole, we were a comfortable and happy
community. Barlow and Walsall's men were not unhappy in those
days, I believe. We were liberal; the men lived.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, that is true. Even twenty years ago the place was
still jolly.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: And then, when Gerald was a lad of thirteen, came
the great lock-out. We belonged to the Masters' Federation--I was
but one man on the Board. We had to abide by the decision. The
mines were closed till the men would accept the reduction.--Well,
that cut my life across. We were shutting the men out from work,
starving their families, in order to force them to accept a
reduction. It may be the condition of trade made it imperative.
But, for myself, I would rather have lost everything.--Of course,
we did what we could. Food was very cheap--practically given
away. We had open kitchen here. And it was mercifully warm
summer-time. Nevertheless, there was privation and suffering, and
trouble and bitterness. We had the redcoats down--even to guard
this house. And from this window I saw Whatmore head-stocks
ablaze, and before I could get to the spot the soldiers had shot
two poor fellows. They were not killed, thank God--</p>

<p>OLIVER: Ah, but they enjoyed it--they enjoyed it immensely. I
remember what grand old sporting weeks they were. It was like a
fox-hunt, so lively and gay--bands and tea-parties and excitement
everywhere, pit-ponies loose, men all over the countryside--</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: There was a great deal of suffering which you were
too young to appreciate. However, since that year I have had to
acknowledge a new situation--a radical if unspoken opposition
between masters and men. Since that year we have been split into
opposite camps. Whatever I might privately feel, I was one of the
owners, one of the masters, and therefore in the opposite camp.
To my men I was an oppressor, a representative of injustice and
greed. Privately, I like to think that even to this day they bear
me no malice, that they have some lingering regard for me. But
the master stands before the human being, and the condition of
war overrides individuals--they hate the master, even whilst, as
a human being, he would be their friend. I recognize the
inevitable justice. It is the price one has to pay.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, it is difficult--very.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Perhaps I weary you?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Oh, no--no.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Well--then the mines began to pay badly. The seams
ran thin and unprofitable, work was short. Either we must close
down or introduce a new system, American methods, which I dislike
so extremely. Now it really became a case of men working against
machines, flesh and blood working against iron, for a livelihood.
Still, it had to be done--the whole system revolutionized. Gerald
took it in hand--and now I hardly know my own pits, with the
great electric plants and strange machinery, and the new
coal-cutters--iron men, as the colliers call them--everything
running at top speed, utterly dehumanized, inhuman. Well, it had
to be done; it was the only alternative to closing down and
throwing three thousand men out of work. And Gerald has done it.
But I can't bear to see it. The men of this generation are not
like my men. They are worn and gloomy; they have a hollow look
that I can't bear to see. They are a great grief to me. I
remember my men even twenty years ago--a noisy, lively, careless
set, who kept the place ringing. Now it is too quiet--too quiet.
There is something wrong in the quietness, something unnatural. I
feel it is unnatural; I feel afraid of it. And I cannot help
feeling guilty.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes--I understand. It terrifies me.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Does it?--does it?--Yes.--And as my wife says, I
leave it all to Gerald--this terrible situation. But I appeal to
God, if anything in my power could have averted it, I would have
averted it. I would have made any sacrifice. For it is a great
and bitter trouble to me.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Ah, well, in death there is no industrial situation.
Something must be different there.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes--yes.</p>

<p>OLIVER: And you see sacrifice isn't the slightest use. If only
people would be sane and decent.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, indeed.--Would you be so good as to ring,
Oliver? I think I must go to bed.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Ah, you have over-tired yourself.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: No, my dear--not over-tired. Excuse me if I have
burdened you with all this. It relieves me to speak of it.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I realize <i>how</i> terrible it is, Mr Barlow--and
how helpless one is.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Thank you, my dear, for your sympathy.</p>

<p>OLIVER: If the people for one minute pulled themselves up and
conquered their mania for money and machine excitement, the whole
thing would be solved.--Would you like me to find Winnie and tell
her to say good night to you?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: If you would be so kind. (<i>Exit</i> OLIVER.)
Can't you find a sweet that you would like, my dear? Won't you
take a little cherry brandy?</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> BUTLER.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Thank you.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: You will go up, sir?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: Yes, William.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: You are tired to-night, sir.</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: It has come over me just now.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: I wish you went up before you became so over-tired,
sir. Would you like Nurse?</p>

<p>MR BARLOW: No, I'll go with you, William. Good night, my
dear.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Good night, Mr Barlow. I am so sorry if you are
overtired.</p>

<p>Exit BUTLER <i>and</i> MR BARLOW. ANABEL <i>takes a drink and
goes to the</i> fire. <i>Enter</i> GERALD.</p>

<p>GERALD: Father gone up?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes.</p>

<p>GERALD: I thought I heard him. Has he been talking too
much?--Poor Father, he will take things to heart.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Tragic, really.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, I suppose it is. But one can get beyond
tragedy--beyond the state of feeling tragical, I mean. Father
himself is tragical. One feels he is mistaken--and yet he
wouldn't be any different, and be himself, I suppose. He's sort
of crucified on an idea of the working people. It's rather
horrible when he's one father.--However, apart from tragedy, how
do you like being here, in this house?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I like the house. It's rather too comfortable.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes. But how do you like being here?</p>

<p>ANABEL: How do you like my being in your home?</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, I think you're very decorative.</p>

<p>ANABEL: More decorative than comfortable?</p>

<p>GERALD: Perhaps. But perhaps you give the necessary finish to
the establishment.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Like the correct window-curtains?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, something like that. I say, why did you come,
Anabel? Why did you come slap-bang into the middle of us?--It's
not expostulation--I want to know.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You mean you want to be told.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, I want to be told.</p>

<p>ANABEL: That's rather mean of you. You should savvy, and let
it go without saying.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, but I don't savvy.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then wait till you do.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, I want to be told. There's a difference in you,
Anabel, that puts me out, rather. You're sort of softer and
sweeter--I'm not sure whether it isn't a touch of Father in you.
There's a little sanctified smudge on your face. Are you really a
bit sanctified?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, not sanctified. It's true I feel different. I feel
I want a new way of life--something more dignified, more
religious, if you like--anyhow, something <i>positive.</i></p>

<p>GERALD: Is it the change of heart, Anabel?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Perhaps it is, Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm not sure that I like it. Isn't it like a berry
that decides to get very sweet, and goes soft?</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't think so.</p>

<p>GERALD: Slightly sanctimonious. I think I liked you better
before. I don't think I like you with this touch of aureole.
People seem to me so horribly self-satisfied when they get a
change of heart--they take such a fearful lot of credit to
themselves on the strength of it.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't think I do.--Do you feel no different,
Gerald?</p>

<p>GERALD: Radically, I can't say I do.--I feel very much more
indifferent.</p>

<p>ANABEL: What to?</p>

<p>GERALD: Everything.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You're still angry--that's what it is.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh yes, I'm angry. But that is part of my normal
state.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why are you angry?</p>

<p>GERALD: Is there any reason why I shouldn't be angry? I'm
angry because you treated me--well, so impudently,
really--clearing out and leaving one to whistle to the empty
walls.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Don't you think it was time I cleared out, when you
became so violent, and really dangerous, really like a
madman?</p>

<p>GERALD: Time or not time, you went--you disappeared and left
us high and dry--and I am still angry.--But I'm not only angry
about that. I'm angry with the colliers, with Labour for its
low-down impudence--and I'm angry with Father for being so
ill--and I'm angry with Mother for looking such a hopeless
thing--and I'm angry with Oliver because he thinks so much--</p>

<p>ANABEL: And what are you angry with yourself for?</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm angry with myself for being myself--I always was
that. I was always a curse to myself.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And that's why you curse others so much?</p>

<p>GERALD: You talk as if butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You see, Gerald, there has to be a change. You'll have
to change.</p>

<p>GERALD: Change of heart?--Well, it won't be to get softer,
Anabel.</p>

<p>ANABEL: You needn't be softer. But you can be quieter, more
sane even. There ought to be some part of you that can be quiet
and apart from the world, some part that can be happy and
gentle.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well, there isn't. I don't pretend to be able to
extricate a soft sort of John Halifax, Gentleman, out of the
machine I'm mixed up in, and keep him to gladden the connubial
hearth. I'm angry, and I'm angry right through, and I'm not going
to play bo-peep with myself, pretending I'm not.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Nobody asks you to. But is there no part of you that
can be a bit gentle and peaceful and happy with a woman?</p>

<p>GERALD: No, there isn't.--I'm not going to smug with you--no,
not I. You're smug in your coming back. You feel virtuous, and
expect me to rise to it. I won't.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then I'd better have stayed away.</p>

<p>GERALD: If you want me to virtue-ize and smug with you, you
had.</p>

<p>ANABEL: What <i>do</i> you want, then?</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't know. I know I don't want <i>that.</i></p>

<p>ANABEL: Oh, very well. (<i>Goes to the piano; begins to
play.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> MRS BARLOW.</p>

<p>GERALD: Hello, Mother! Father <i>has</i> gone to bed.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Oh, I thought he was down here talking. You two
alone?</p>

<p>GERALD: With the piano for chaperone, Mother.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: That's more than I gave you credit for. I haven't
come to chaperone you either, Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: Chaperone <i>me,</i> Mother! Do you think I need
it?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: If you do, you won't get it. I've come too late to
be of any use in that way, as far as I hear.</p>

<p>GERALD: What have you heard, Mother?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: I heard Oliver and this young woman talking.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, did you? When? What did they say?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Something about married in the sight of heaven,
but couldn't keep it up on earth.</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't understand.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: That you and this young woman were married in the
sight of heaven, or through eternity, or something similar, but
that you couldn't make up your minds to it on earth.</p>

<p>GERALD: Really! That's very curious, Mother.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Very common occurrence, I believe.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, so it is. But I don't think you heard quite
right, dear. There seems to be some lingering uneasiness in
heaven as a matter of fact. We'd quite made up our minds to live
apart on earth. But where did you hear this, Mother?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: I heard it outside the studio door this
morning.</p>

<p>GERALD: You mean you happened to be on one side of the door
while Oliver and Anabel were talking on the other?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: You'd make a detective, Gerald--you're so good at
putting two and two together. I listened till I'd heard as much
as I wanted. I'm not sure I didn't come down here hoping to hear
another conversation going on.</p>

<p>GERALD: Listen outside the door, darling?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: There'd be nothing to listen to if I were
inside.</p>

<p>GERALD: It isn't usually done, you know.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: I listen outside doors when I have occasion to be
interested--which isn't often, unfortunately for me.</p>

<p>GERALD: But I've a queer feeling that you have a permanent
occasion to be interested in me. I only half like it.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: It's surprising how uninteresting you are, Gerald,
for a man of your years. I have not had occasion to listen
outside a door, for you, no, not for a great while, believe
me.</p>

<p>GERALD: I believe you implicitly, darling. But do you happen
to know me through and through, and in and out, all my past and
present doings, Mother? Have you a secret access to my room, and
a spy-hole, and all those things? This is uncomfortably
thrilling. You take on a new lustre.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Your memoirs wouldn't make you famous, my son.</p>

<p>GERALD: Infamous, dear?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Good heavens, no! What a lot you expect from your
very mild sins! You and this young woman have lived together,
then?</p>

<p>GERALD: Don't say "this young woman", Mother dear--it's
slightly vulgar. It isn't for me to compromise Anabel by
admitting such a thing, you know.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Do you ask me to call her Anabel? I won't.</p>

<p>GERALD: Then say "this person", Mother. It's more
becoming.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: I didn't come to speak to you, Gerald. I know you.
I came to speak to this young woman.</p>

<p>GERALD: "Person", Mother.--Will you curtsey, Anabel? And I'll
twist my handkerchief. We shall make a Cruikshank drawing, if
Mother makes her hair a little more slovenly.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: You and Gerald were together for some time?</p>

<p>GERALD: Three years, off and on, Mother.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: And then you suddenly dropped my son, and went
away?</p>

<p>GERALD: To Norway, Mother--so I have gathered.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: And now you have come back because that last one
died?</p>

<p>GERALD: Is he dead, Anabel? How did he die?</p>

<p>ANABEL: He was killed on the ice.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, God!</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Now, having had your fill of tragedy, you have
come back to be demure and to marry Gerald. Does he thank
you?</p>

<p>GERALD: You must listen outside the door, Mother, to find that
out.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Well, it's your own affair.</p>

<p>GERALD: What a lame summing up, Mother!--quite unworthy of
you.</p>

<p>ANABEL: What did you wish to say to me, Mrs Barlow? Please say
it.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: What did I wish to say! Ay, what did I wish to
say! What is the use of my saying anything? What am I but a
buffoon and a slovenly caricature in the family?</p>

<p>GERALD: No, Mother dear, don't climb down--please don't. Tell
Anabel what you wanted to say.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Yes--yes--yes. I came to say--don't be good to my
son--don't be good to him.</p>

<p>GERALD: Sounds weak, dear--mere contrariness.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Don't presume to be good to my son, young woman. I
won't have it, even if he will. You hear me?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes. I won't presume, then.</p>

<p>GERALD: May she presume to be bad to me, Mother?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: For that you may look after yourself.--But a woman
who was good to him would ruin him in six months, take the
manhood out of him. He has a tendency, a secret hankering, to
make a gift of himself to somebody. He shan't do it. I warn you.
I am not a woman to be despised.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No--I understand.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Only one other thing I ask. If he must fight--and
fight he must--let him alone: don't you try to shield him or save
him. <i>Don't interfere</i>--do you hear?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Not till I must.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: <i>Never.</i> Learn your place, and keep it. Keep
away from him, if you are going to be a wife to him. Don't go too
near. And don't let him come too near. Beat him off if he tries.
Keep a solitude in your heart even when you love him best. Keep
it. If you lose it, you lose everything.</p>

<p>GERALD: But that isn't love, Mother.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: What?</p>

<p>GERALD: That isn't love.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: <i>What?</i> What do you know of love, you ninny?
You only know the feeding-bottle. It's what you want, all of
you--to be brought up by hand, and mew about love. Ah, God!--Ah,
God!--that you should none of you know the only thing which would
make you worth having.</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't believe in your only thing, Mother. But what
is it?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: What you haven't got--the power to be alone.</p>

<p>GERALD: Sort of megalomania, you mean?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: What? Megalomania! What is your <i>love</i> but a
megalomania, flowing over everybody, and everything like spilt
water? Megalomania! I hate you, you softy! I would <i>beat</i>
you (<i>suddenly advancing on him and beating him
fiercely</i>)--beat you into some manhood--beat you--</p>

<p>GERALD: Stop, Mother--keep off.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: It's the men who need beating nowadays, not the
children. Beat the softness out of him, young woman. It's the
only way, if you love him enough--if you love him enough.</p>

<p>GERALD: You hear, Anabel?</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Speak roughly to your little boy,<br>
 And beat him when he sneezes.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>MRS BARLOW (<i>catching up a large old fan, and smashing it
about his head</i>): You softy--you piffler--you will never have
had enough! Ah, you should be thrust in the fire, you should, to
have the softness and the brittleness burnt out of you!</p>

<p><i>The door opens</i>--OLIVER TURTON <i>enters, followed
by</i> JOB ARTHUR FREER. MRS BARLOW <i>is still attacking</i>
GERALD. <i>She turns, infuriated.</i></p>

<p>Go out! Go out! What do you mean by coming in unannounced?
Take him upstairs--take that fellow into the library, Oliver
Turton.</p>

<p>GERALD: Mother, you improve our already pretty reputation.
Already they say you are mad.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW (<i>ringing violently</i>): Let me be mad then. I
am mad--driven mad. One day I shall kill you, Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: You won't, Mother, because I shan't let you.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Let me!--let me! As if I should wait for you to
let me!</p>

<p>GERALD: I am a match for you even in violence, come to
that.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: A match! A damp match. A wet match.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> BUTLER.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: You rang, madam?</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: Clear up those bits.--Where are you going to see
that white-faced fellow? Here?</p>

<p>GERALD: I think so.</p>

<p>MRS BARLOW: You will <i>still</i> have them coming to the
house, will you? You will still let them trample in our private
rooms, will you? Bah! I ought to leave you to your own
devices.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> MRS BARLOW.</p>

<p>GERALD: When you've done that, William, ask Mr Freer to come
down here.</p>

<p>WILLIAM: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>A pause. Exit</i> WILLIAM.</p>

<p>GERALD: So--o--o. You've had another glimpse of the family
life.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes. Rather--disturbing.</p>

<p>GERALD: Not at all, when you're used to it. Mother isn't as
mad as she pretends to be.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't think she's mad at all. I think she has most
desperate courage.</p>

<p>GERALD: "Courage" is good. That's a new term for it.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, courage. When a man says "courage" he means the
courage to die. A woman means the courage to live. That's what
women hate men most for; that they haven't the courage to
live.</p>

<p>GERALD: Mother takes her courage into both hands rather
late.</p>

<p>ANABEL: We're a little late ourselves.</p>

<p>GERALD: We are, rather. By the way, you seem to have had
plenty of the courage of death--you've played a pretty deathly
game, it seems to me--both when I knew you and afterwards, you've
had your finger pretty deep in the death-pie.</p>

<p>ANABEL: That's why I want a change of--of--</p>

<p>GERALD: Of heart?--Better take Mother's tip, and try the
poker.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I will.</p>

<p>GERALD: Ha--corraggio!</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes--corraggio!</p>

<p>GERALD: Corraggiaccio!</p>

<p>ANABEL: Corraggione!</p>

<p>GERALD: Cock-a-doodle-doo!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> OLIVER <i>and</i> FREER.</p>

<p>Oh, come in. Don't be afraid; it's a charade. (ANABEL
<i>rises.</i>) No, don't go, Anabel. Corraggio! Take a seat, Mr
Freer.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Sounds like a sneezing game, doesn't it?</p>

<p>GERALD: It is. Do you know the famous rhyme:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Speak roughly to your little boy,<br>
 And beat him when he sneezes?</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: No, I can't say I do.</p>

<p>GERALD: My mother does. Will you have anything to drink? Will
you help yourself?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--no--I don't think I'll have anything,
thanks.</p>

<p>GERALD: A cherry brandy?--Yes?--ANABEL, what's yours.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Did I see K&uuml;mmel?</p>

<p>GERALD: You did. (<i>They all take drinks.</i>) What's the
latest, Mr Freer?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: The latest? Well, I don't know, I'm sure--</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, yes. Trot it out. We're quite private.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--I don't know. There's several things.</p>

<p>GERALD: The more the merrier.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I'm not so sure. The men are in a very funny
temper, Mr Barlow--very funny.</p>

<p>GERALD: Coincidence--so am I. Not surprising, is it?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: The men, perhaps not.</p>

<p>GERALD: What else, Job Arthur?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You know the men have decided to stand by the
office men?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: They've agreed to come out next Monday.</p>

<p>GERALD: Have they?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes; there was no stopping them. They decided for
it like one man.</p>

<p>GERALD: How was that?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: That's what surprises me. They're a jolly sight
more certain over this than they've ever been over their own
interests.</p>

<p>GERALD: All their love for the office clerks coming out in a
rush?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well, I don't know about love; but that's how it
is.</p>

<p>GERALD: What is it, if it isn't love?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I can't say. They're in a funny temper. It's hard
to make out.</p>

<p>GERALD: A funny temper, are they? Then I suppose we ought to
laugh.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: No, I don't think it's a laughing matter. They're
coming out on Monday for certain.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes--so are daffodils.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Beg pardon?</p>

<p>GERALD: Daffodils.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: No, I don't follow what you mean.</p>

<p>GERALD: Don't you? But I thought Alfred Breffitt and William
Straw were not very popular.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: No, they aren't--not in themselves. But it's the
principle of the thing--so it seems.</p>

<p>GERALD: What principle?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Why, all sticking together, for one thing--all
Barlow and Walsall's men holding by one another.</p>

<p>GERALD: United we stand?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: That's it. And then it's the strong defending the
weak as well. There's three thousand colliers standing up for
thirty-odd office men. I must say I think it's sporting
myself.</p>

<p>GERALD: You do, do you? United we stand, divided we fall. What
do they stand for, really? What is it?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--for their right to a living wage. That's how
I see it.</p>

<p>GERALD: For their right to a living wage! Just that?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, sir--that's how I see it.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well, that doesn't seem so preposterously difficult,
does it?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Why, that's what I think myself, Mr Gerald. It's
such a little thing.</p>

<p>GERALD: Quite. I suppose the men themselves are to judge what
is a living wage?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Oh, I think they're quite reasonable, you
know.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, yes, eminently reasonable. Reason's their strong
point.--And if they get their increase, they'll be quite
contented?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, as far as I know, they will.</p>

<p>GERALD: As far as you know? Why, is there something you don't
know?--something you're not sure about?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: No--I don't think so. I think they'll be quite
satisfied this time.</p>

<p>GERALD: Why this time? Is there going to be a next
time--every-day-has-its-to-morrow kind of thing?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know about that. It's a funny world, Mr
Barlow.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, I quite believe it. How do you see it funny?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Oh, I don't know. Everything's in a funny
state.</p>

<p>GERALD: What do you mean by everything?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--I mean things in general--Labour, for
example.</p>

<p>GERALD: You think Labour's in a funny state, do you? What do
you think it wants? What do you think, personally?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well, in my own mind, I think it wants a bit of
its own back.</p>

<p>GERALD: And how does it mean to get it?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Ha! that's not so easy to say. But it means to
have it, in the long run.</p>

<p>GERALD: You mean by increasing demands for higher wages?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, perhaps that's one road.</p>

<p>GERALD: Do you see any other?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Not just for the present.</p>

<p>GERALD: But later on?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I can't say about that. The men will be quiet
enough for a bit, if it's alright about the office men, you
know.</p>

<p>GERALD: Probably. But have Barlow and Walsall's men any
special grievance apart from the rest of the miners?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know. They've no liking for you, you know,
sir.</p>

<p>GERALD: Why?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: They think you've got a down on them.</p>

<p>GERALD: Why should they?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know, sir; but they do.</p>

<p>GERALD: So they have a personal feeling against me? You don't
think all the colliers are the same, all over the country?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I think there's a good deal of feeling--</p>

<p>GERALD: Of wanting their own back?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: That's it.</p>

<p>GERALD: But what can they do? I don't see what they can do.
They can go out on strike--but they've done that before, and the
owners, at a pinch, can stand it better than they can. As for the
ruin of the industry, if they do ruin it, it falls heaviest on
them. In fact, it leaves them destitute. There's nothing they can
do, you know, that doesn't hit them worse than it hits us.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I know there's something in that. But if they had
a strong man to head them, you see--</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, I've heard a lot about that strong man--but I've
never come across any signs of him, you know. I don't believe in
one strong man appearing out of so many little men. All men are
pretty big in an age, or in a movement, which produces a really
big man. And Labour is a great swarm of hopelessly little men.
That's how I see it.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I'm not so sure about that.</p>

<p>GERALD: I am. Labour is a thing that can't have a head. It's a
sort of unwieldy monster that's bound to run its skull against
the wall sooner or later, and knock out what bit of brain it's
got. You see, you need wit and courage and real understanding if
you're going to do anything positive. And Labour has none of
these things--certainly it shows no sign of them.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, when it has a chance, I think you'll see
plenty of courage and plenty of understanding.</p>

<p>GERALD: It always has a chance. And where one sees a bit of
courage, there's no understanding; and where there's some
understanding, there's absolutely no courage. It's hopeless, you
know--it would be far best if they'd all give it up, and try a
new line.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't think they will.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, I don't either. They'll make a mess, and when
they've made it, they'll never get out of it. They can't--they're
too stupid.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: They've never had a try yet.</p>

<p>GERALD: They're trying every day. They just simply couldn't
control modern industry--they haven't the intelligence. They've
no <i>life</i> intelligence. The owners may have little enough,
but Labour has none. They're just mechanical little things that
can make one or two motions, and they're done. They've no more
idea of life than a lawn-mower has.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: It remains to be seen.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, it doesn't. It's perfectly obvious--there's
nothing remains to be seen. All that Labour is capable of, is
smashing things up. And even for that I don't believe it has
either energy or the courage or the bit of necessary passion, or
slap-dash--call it whatever you will. However, we'll see.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, sir. Perhaps you see now why you're not so
very popular, Mr Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: We can't all be popular, Job Arthur. You're very high
up in popularity, I believe.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Not so very. They listen to me a bit. But you
never know when they'll let you down. I know they'll let me down
one day--so it won't be a surprise.</p>

<p>GERALD: I should think not.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: But about the office men, Mr Gerald. You think
it'll be alright?</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, yes, that'll be alright.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Easiest for this time, anyhow, sir. We don't want
bloodshed, do we?</p>

<p>GERALD: I shouldn't mind at all. It might clear the way to
something. But I have absolutely no belief in the power of Labour
even to bring about anything so positive as bloodshed.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know about that--I don't know.--Well.</p>

<p>GERALD: Have another drink before you go.--Yes, do. Help
yourself.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--if you're so pressing. (<i>Helps
himself.</i>) Here's luck, all!</p>

<p>ALL: Thanks.</p>

<p>GERALD: Take a cigar--there's the box. Go on--take a
handful--fill your case.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: They're a great luxury nowadays, aren't they?
Almost beyond a man like me.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, that's the worst of not being a bloated
capitalist. Never mind, you'll be a Cabinet Minister some
day.--Oh, alright--I'll open the door for you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Oh, don't trouble. Good night--good night.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt</i> JOB ARTHUR <i>and</i> GERALD.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Oh God, what a world to live in!</p>

<p>ANABEL: I rather liked him. What is he?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Checkweighman--local secretary for the Miners'
Federation--plays the violin well, although he was a collier, and
it spoilt his hands. They're a musical family.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But isn't he rather nice?</p>

<p>OLIVER: I don't like him. But I confess he's a study. He's the
modern Judas.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Don't you think he likes Gerald?</p>

<p>OLIVER: I'm sure he does. The way he suns himself here--like a
cat purring in his luxuriation.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I don't mind it. It shows a certain sensitiveness
and a certain taste.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, he has both--touch of the artist, as Mrs Barlow
says. He loves refinement, culture, breeding, all those
things--loves them--and a presence, a fine free manner.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But that is nice in him.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Quite. But what he loves, and what he admires, and
what he aspires to, he <i>must</i> betray. It's his fatality. He
lives for the moment when he can kiss Gerald in the Garden of
Olives, or wherever it was.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But Gerald shouldn't be kissed.</p>

<p>OLIVER: That's what I say.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And that's what his mother means as well, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> GERALD.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well--you've heard the voice of the people.</p>

<p>ANABEL: He isn't the people.</p>

<p>GERALD: I think he is, myself--the epitome.</p>

<p>OLIVER: No, he's a special type.</p>

<p>GERALD: Ineffectual, don't you think?</p>

<p>ANABEL: How pleased you are, Gerald! How pleased you are with
yourself! You love the turn with him.</p>

<p>GERALD: It's rather stimulating, you know.</p>

<p>ANABEL: It oughtn't to be, then.</p>

<p>OLIVER: He's your Judas, and you love him.</p>

<p>GERALD: Nothing so deep. He's just a sort of &AElig;olian harp
that sings to the temper of the wind. I find him amusing.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I think it's boring.</p>

<p>OLIVER: And I think it's nasty.</p>

<p>GERALD: I believe you're both jealous of him. What do you
think of the British working man, Oliver?</p>

<p>OLIVER: It seems to me he's in nearly as bad a way as the
British employer: he's nearly as much beside the point.</p>

<p>GERALD: What point?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Oh, just life.</p>

<p>GERALD: That's too vague, my boy. Do you think they'll ever
make a bust-up?</p>

<p>OLIVER: I can't tell. I don't see any good in it, if they
do.</p>

<p>GERALD: It might clear the way--and it might block the way for
ever: depends what comes through. But, sincerely, I don't think
they've got it in them.</p>

<p>ANABEL: They may have something better.</p>

<p>GERALD: That suggestion doesn't interest me, Anabel. Ah well,
we shall see what we shall see. Have a whisky and soda with me,
Oliver, and let the troubled course of this evening run to a
smooth close. It's quite like old times. Aren't you smoking,
Anabel?</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, thanks.</p>

<p>GERALD: I believe you're a reformed character. So it won't be
like old times, after all.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I don't want old times. I want new ones.</p>

<p>GERALD: Wait till Job Arthur has risen like Antichrist, and
proclaimed the resurrection of the gods.--Do you see Job Arthur
proclaiming Dionysus and Aphrodite?</p>

<p>ANABEL: It bores me. I don't like your mood. Good night.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, don't go.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, good night.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> ANABEL.</p>

<p>OLIVER: She's <i>not</i> reformed, Gerald. She's the same old
moral character--moral to the last bit of her, really--as she
always was.</p>

<p>GERALD: Is that what it is?--But one must be moral.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Oh, yes. Oliver Cromwell wasn't as moral as Anabel
is--nor such an iconoclast.</p>

<p>GERALD: Poor old Anabel!</p>

<p>OLIVER: How she hates the dark gods!</p>

<p>GERALD: And yet they cast a spell over her. Poor old Anabel!
Well, Oliver, is Bacchus the father of whisky?</p>

<p>OLIVER: I don't know.--I don't like you either. You seem to
smile all over yourself. It's objectionable. Good night.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, look here, this is censorious.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You smile to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> OLIVER.</p>

<p>CURTAIN</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h1><a name="#a03">ACT III</a></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2>SCENE I</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>An old park. Early evening. In the background a low
Georgian hall, which has been turned into offices for the
Company, shows windows already lighted.</i> GERALD <i>and</i>
ANABEL <i>walk along the path.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>ANABEL: How beautiful this old park is!</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, it is beautiful--seems so far away from
everywhere, if one doesn't remember that the hall is turned into
offices.--No one has lived here since I was a little boy. I
remember going to a Christmas party at the Walsalls'.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Has it been shut up so long?</p>

<p>GERALD: The Walsalls didn't like it--too near the ugliness.
They were county, you know--we never were: Father never gave
Mother a chance, there. And besides, the place is damp, cellars
full of water.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Even now?</p>

<p>GERALD: No, not now--they've been drained. But the place would
be too damp for a dwelling-house. It's alright as offices. They
burn enormous fires. The rooms are quite charming. This is what
happens to the stately homes of England--they buzz with inky
clerks, or their equivalent. Stateliness is on its last legs.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, it grieves me--though I should be bored if I had
to be stately, I think.--Isn't it beautiful in this light, like
an eighteenth-century aquatint? I'm sure no age was as ugly as
this, since the world began.</p>

<p>GERALD: For pure ugliness, certainly not. And I believe none
has been so filthy to live in.--Let us sit down a minute, shall
we? and watch the rooks fly home. It always stirs sad,
sentimental feelings in me.</p>

<p>ANABEL: So it does in me.--Listen! one can hear the coal-carts
on the road--and the brook--and the dull noise of the town--and
the beating of New London pit--and voices--and the rooks--and yet
it is so still. We seem so still here, don't we?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Don't you think we've been wrong?</p>

<p>GERALD: How?</p>

<p>ANABEL: In the way we've lived--and the way we've loved.</p>

<p>GERALD: It hasn't been heaven, has it? Yet, I don't know that
we've been wrong, Anabel. We had it to go through.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Perhaps.--And, yes, we've been wrong too.</p>

<p>GERALD: Probably. Only, I don't feel it like that.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then I think you ought. You ought to feel you've been
wrong.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, probably. Only, I don't. I can't help it. I think
we've gone the way we had to go, following our own natures.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And where has it landed us?</p>

<p>GERALD: Here.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And where is that?</p>

<p>GERALD: Just on this bench in the park, looking at the
evening.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But what next?</p>

<p>GERALD: God knows! Why trouble?</p>

<p>ANABEL: One must trouble. I want to feel sure.</p>

<p>GERALD: What of?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Of you--and of myself.</p>

<p>GERALD: Then <i>be</i> sure.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But I can't. Think of the past--what it's been.</p>

<p>GERALD: This isn't the past.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But what is it? Is there anything sure in it? Is there
any real happiness?</p>

<p>GERALD: Why not?</p>

<p>ANABEL: But how can you ask? Think of what our life has
been.</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't want to.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, you don't. But what <i>do</i> you want?</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm alright, you know, sitting here like this.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But one can't sit here for ever, can one?</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't want to.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And what will you do when we leave here?</p>

<p>GERALD: God knows! Don't worry me. Be still a bit.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But <i>I'm</i> worried. You don't love me.</p>

<p>GERALD: I won't argue it.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And I'm not happy.</p>

<p>GERALD: Why not, Anabel?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Because you don't love me--and I can't forget.</p>

<p>GERALD: I do love you--and to-night I've forgotten.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then make me forget, too. Make me happy.</p>

<p>GERALD: I <i>can't</i> make you--and you know it.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, you can. It's your business to make me happy.
I've made you happy.</p>

<p>GERALD: You want to make me unhappy.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I <i>do</i> think you're the last word in selfishness.
If I say I can't forget, you merely say, "<i>I've</i> forgotten";
and if I say I'm unhappy, all <i>you</i> can answer is that I
want to make <i>you</i> unhappy. I don't in the least. I want to
be happy myself. But you don't help me.</p>

<p>GERALD: There is no help for it, you see. If you <i>were</i>
happy with me here you'd be happy. As you aren't, nothing will
make you--not genuinely.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And that's all you care.</p>

<p>GERALD: No--I wish we could both be happy at the same moment.
But apparently we can't.</p>

<p>ANABEL: And why not?--Because you're selfish, and think of
nothing but yourself and your own feelings.</p>

<p>GERALD: If it is so, it is so.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then we shall never be happy.</p>

<p>GERALD: Then we shan't. (<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then what are we going to do?</p>

<p>GERALD: Do?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Do you want me to be with you?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Are you sure?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then why don't you want me to be happy?</p>

<p>GERALD: If you'd only <i>be</i> happy, here and now--</p>

<p>ANABEL: How can I?</p>

<p>GERALD: How can't you?--You've got a devil inside you.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Then make me not have a devil.</p>

<p>GERALD: I've known you long enough--and known myself long
enough--to know I can make you nothing at all, Anabel: neither
can you make me. If the happiness isn't there--well, we shall
have to wait for it, like a dispensation. It probably means we
shall have to hate each other a little more.--I suppose hate is a
real process.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I know you believe more in hate than in love.</p>

<p>GERALD: Nobody is more weary of hate than I am--and yet we
can't fix our own hour, when we shall leave off hating and
fighting. It has to work itself out in us.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But I don't <i>want</i> to hate and fight with you any
more. I don't <i>believe</i> in it--not any more.</p>

<p>GERALD: It's a cleansing process--like Aristotle's Katharsis.
We shall hate ourselves clean at last, I suppose.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why aren't you clean now? Why can't you love? (<i>He
laughs.</i>) <i>Do</i> you love me?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Do you want to be with me for ever?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Sure?</p>

<p>GERALD: Quite sure.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why are you so cool about it?</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm not. I'm only sure--which you are not.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Yes, I am--I <i>want</i> to be married to you.</p>

<p>GERALD: I know you want me to want you to be married to me.
But whether off your own bat you have a positive desire that way,
I'm not sure. You keep something back--some sort of female
reservation--like a dagger up your sleeve. You want to see me in
transports of love for you.</p>

<p>ANABEL: How can you say so? There--you see--there--this is the
man that pretends to love me, and then says I keep a dagger up my
sleeve. You liar!</p>

<p>GERALD: I do love you--and you do keep a dagger up your
sleeve--some devilish little female reservation which spies at me
from a distance, in your soul, all the time, as if I were an
enemy.</p>

<p>ANABEL: How <i>can</i> you say so?--Doesn't it show what you
must be yourself? Doesn't it show?--What is there in your
soul?</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't know.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Love, pure love?--Do you pretend it's love?</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm so tired of this.</p>

<p>ANABEL: So am I, dead tired: you self-deceiving,
self-complacent thing. Ha!--aren't you just the same. You haven't
altered one scrap, not a scrap.</p>

<p>GERALD: Alright--you are always free to change yourself.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I <i>have</i> changed, I <i>am</i> better, I <i>do</i>
love you--I love you wholly and unselfishly--I do--and I want a
good new life with you.</p>

<p>GERALD: You're terribly wrapped up in your new goodness. I
wish you'd make up your mind to be downright bad.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Ha!--Do you?--You'd soon see. You'd soon see where
you'd be if--There's somebody coming. (<i>Rises</i>.)</p>

<p>GERALD: Never mind; it's the clerks leaving work, I suppose.
Sit still.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Won't you go?</p>

<p>GERALD: No. (<i>A man draws near, followed by another.</i>)
Good evening.</p>

<p>CLERK: Good evening, sir. (<i>Passes on.</i>) Good evening, Mr
Barlow.</p>

<p>ANABEL: They are afraid.</p>

<p>GERALD: I suppose their consciences are uneasy about this
strike.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Did you come to sit here just to catch them, like a
spider waiting for them?</p>

<p>GERALD: No. I wanted to speak to Breffitt.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I believe you're capable of any horridness.</p>

<p>GERALD: Alright, you believe it. (<i>Two more figures
approach.</i>) Good evening.</p>

<p>CLERKS: Good night, sir. (<i>One passes, one stops.</i>) Good
evening, Mr Barlow. Er--did you want to see Mr Breffitt, sir?</p>

<p>GERALD: Not particularly.</p>

<p>CLERK: Oh! He'll be out directly, sir--if you'd like me to go
back and tell him you wanted him.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, thank you.</p>

<p>CLERK: Good night, sir. Excuse me asking.</p>

<p>GERALD: Good night.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Who is Mr Breffitt?</p>

<p>GERALD: He is the chief clerk--and cashier--one of Father's
old pillars of society.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Don't you like him?</p>

<p>GERALD: Not much.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Why?--You seem to dislike very easily.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, they all used to try to snub me, these old
buffers. They detest me like poison, because I am different from
Father.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I believe you enjoy being detested.</p>

<p>GERALD: I do. (<i>Another clerk
approaches--hesitates--stops.</i>)</p>

<p>CLERK: Good evening, sir. Good evening, Mr Barlow. Er--did you
want anybody at the office, sir? We're just closing.</p>

<p>GERALD: No, I didn't want anybody.</p>

<p>CLERK: Oh, no, sir. I see. Er--by the way, sir--er--I hope you
don't think this--er--bother about an increase--this strike
threat--started in the office.</p>

<p>GERALD: Where did it start?</p>

<p>CLERK: I should think it started--where it usually starts, Mr
Barlow--among a few loud-mouthed people who think they can do as
they like with the men. They're only using the office men as a
cry--that's all. They've no interest in us. They want to show
their power.--That's how it is, sir.</p>

<p>GERALD: Oh, yes.</p>

<p>CLERK: We're powerless, if they like to make a cry out of
us.</p>

<p>GERALD: Quite.</p>

<p>CLERK: We're as much put out about it as anybody.</p>

<p>GERALD: Of course.</p>

<p>CLERK: Yes--well--good night, sir. (<i>Clerks draw near--there
is a</i> s<i>ound of loud young voices and bicycle bells.
Bicycles sweep past.</i>)</p>

<p>CLERKS: Good night, sir.--Good night, sir.</p>

<p>GERALD: Good night.--They're very bucked to see me sitting
here with a woman--a young lady as they'll say. I guess your name
will be flying round to-morrow. They stop partly to have a good
look at you. Do they know you, do you think?</p>

<p>ANABEL: Sure.</p>

<p>CLERKS: Mr Breffitt's just coming, sir.--Good night,
sir.--Good night, sir. (<i>Another bicycle passes.</i>)</p>

<p>ANABEL: The bicycles don't see us.--Isn't it rather hateful to
be a master? The attitude of them all is so ugly. I can quite see
that it makes you rather a bully.</p>

<p>GERALD: I suppose it does. (<i>Figure of a large man
approaches.</i>)</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Oh--ah--it's Mr Gerald!--I couldn't make out who it
was.--Were you coming up to the office, sir? Do you want me to go
back with you?</p>

<p>GERALD: No, thank you--I just wanted a word with you about
this agitation. It'll do just as well here. It's a pity it
started--that the office should have set it going, Breffitt.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: It's none of the office's doing, I think you'll
find, Mr Gerald. The office men did nothing but ask for a just
advance--at any rate, times and prices being what they are, I
consider it a fair advance. If the men took it up, it's because
they've got a set of loud-mouthed blatherers and agitators among
them like Job Arthur Freer, who deserve to be hung--and hanging
they'd get, if I could have the judging of them.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well--it's very unfortunate--because we can't give the
clerks their increase now, you know.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Can't you?--can't you? I can't see that it would be
anything out of the way, if I say what I think.</p>

<p>GERALD: No. They won't get any increase now. It shouldn't have
been allowed to become a public cry with the colliers. We can't
give in now.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Have the Board decided that?</p>

<p>GERALD: They have--on my advice.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Hm! then the men will come out.</p>

<p>GERALD: We will see.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: It's trouble for nothing--it's trouble that could be
avoided. The clerks could have their advance, and it would hurt
nobody.</p>

<p>GERALD: Too late now.--I suppose if the men come out, the
clerks will come out with them?</p>

<p>BREFFITT: They'll have to--they'll have to.</p>

<p>GERALD: If they do, we may then make certain alterations in
the office staff which have needed making for some time.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Very good--very good. I know what you mean.--I don't
know how your father bears all this, Mr Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: We keep it from him as much as possible.--You'll let
the clerks know the decision. And if they stay out with the men,
I'll go over the list of the staff with you. It has needed
revising for a long time.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: I know what you mean--I know what you mean--I
believe I understand the firm's interest in my department. I
ought, after forty years studying it. I've studied the firm's
interests for forty years, Mr Gerald. I'm not likely to forget
them now.</p>

<p>GERALD: Of course.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: But I think it's a mistake--I think it's a mistake,
and I'm bound to say it, to let a great deal of trouble rise for
a very small cause. The clerks might have had what they
reasonably asked for.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well, it's too late now.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: I suppose it is--I suppose it is. I hope you'll
remember, sir, that I've put the interest of the firm before
everything--before every consideration.</p>

<p>GERALD: Of course, Breffitt.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: But you've not had any liking for the office staff,
I'm afraid, sir--not since your father put you amongst us for a
few months.--Well, sir, we shall weather this gale, I hope, as
we've weathered those in the past. Times don't become better, do
they? Men are an ungrateful lot, and these agitators should be
lynched. They would, if I had my way.</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, of course. Don't wait.</p>

<p>BREFFITT: Good night to you.</p>

<p><i>Exit</i> BREFFITT.</p>

<p>GERALD: Good night.</p>

<p>ANABEL: He's the last, apparently.</p>

<p>GERALD: We'll hope so.</p>

<p>ANABEL: He puts you in a fury.</p>

<p>GERALD: It's his manner. My father spoilt them--abominable old
limpets. And they're so self-righteous. They think I'm a sort of
criminal who has instigated this new devilish system which runs
everything so close and cuts it so fine--as if they hadn't made
this inevitable by their shameless carelessness and wastefulness
in the past. He may well boast of his forty years--forty years'
crass, stupid wastefulness.</p>

<p><i>Two or three more clerks pass, talking till they approach
the seat, then becoming silent after bidding good night.</i></p>

<p>ANABEL: But aren't you a bit sorry for them?</p>

<p>GERALD: Why? If they're poor, what does it matter in a world
of chaos?</p>

<p>ANABEL: And aren't you an obstinate ass not to give them the
bit they want. It's mere stupid obstinacy.</p>

<p>GERALD: It may be. I call it policy.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Men always do call their obstinacy policy.</p>

<p>GERALD: Well, I don't care what happens. I wish things would
come to a head. I only fear they won't.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Aren't you rather wicked?--<i>Asking</i> for
strife?</p>

<p>GERALD: I hope I am. It's quite a relief to me to feel that I
may be wicked. I fear I'm not. I can see them all anticipating
victory, in their low-down fashion wanting to crow their low-down
crowings. I'm afraid I feel it's a righteous cause, to cut a lot
of little combs before I die.</p>

<p>ANABEL: But if they're in the right in what they want?</p>

<p>GERALD: In the right--in the right!--They're just greedy,
incompetent, stupid, gloating in a sense of the worst sort of
power. They're like vicious children, who would like to kill
their parents so that they could have the run of the larder. The
rest is just cant.</p>

<p>ANABEL: If you're the parent in the case, I must say you flow
over with loving-kindness for them.</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't--I detest them. I only hope they will fight.
If they would, I'd have some respect for them. But you'll see
what it will be.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I wish I needn't, for it's very sickening.</p>

<p>GERALD: Sickening beyond expression.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I wish we could go right away.</p>

<p>GERALD: So do I--if one could get oneself out of this. But one
can't. It's the same wherever you have industrialism--and you
have industrialism everywhere, whether it's Timbuctoo or Paraguay
or Antananarivo.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, it isn't: you exaggerate.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR (<i>suddenly approaching from the other side</i>):
Good evening, Mr Barlow. I heard you were in here. Could I have a
word with you?</p>

<p>GERALD: Get on with it, then.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Is it right that you won't meet the clerks?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Not in any way?</p>

<p>GERALD: Not in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: But--I thought I understood from you the other
night--</p>

<p>GERALD: It's all the same what you understood.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Then you take it back, sir?</p>

<p>GERALD: I take nothing back, because I gave nothing.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Oh, excuse me, excuse me, sir. You said it would
be alright about the clerks. This lady heard you say it.</p>

<p>GERALD: Don't you call witnesses against me.--Besides, what
does it matter to you? What in the name of--</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well, sir, you said it would be alright, and I
went on that--</p>

<p>GERALD: You went on that! Where did you go to?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: The men'll be out on Monday.</p>

<p>GERALD: So shall I.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Oh, yes, but--where's it going to end?</p>

<p>GERALD: Do you want me to prophesy? When did I set up for a
public prophet?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know, sir. But perhaps you're doing more
than you know. There's a funny feeling just now among the
men.</p>

<p>GERALD: So I've heard before. Why should I concern myself with
their feelings? Am I to cry when every collier bumps his
funny-bone--or to laugh?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: It's no laughing matter, you see.</p>

<p>GERALD: And I'm sure it's no crying matter--unless you want to
cry, do you see?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Ah, but, very likely, it wouldn't be me who would
cry.--You don't know what might happen, now.</p>

<p>GERALD: I'm waiting for something to happen. I should like
something to happen--very much--very much indeed.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, but perhaps you'd be sorry if it did
happen.</p>

<p>GERALD: Is that a warning or a threat?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't know--it might be a bit of both. What I
mean to say--</p>

<p>GERALD (<i>suddenly seizing him by the scruff of the neck and
shaking him</i>): What do you mean to say?--I mean you to say
less, do you see?--a great deal less--do you see? You've run on
with your saying long enough: that clock had better run down. So
stop your sayings--stop your sayings, I tell you--or you'll have
them shaken out of you--shaken out of you--shaken out of you, do
you see? (<i>Suddenly flings him aside.</i>)</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR, <i>staggering, falls.</i></p>

<p>ANABEL: Oh no!--oh, no!</p>

<p>GERALD: Now get up, Job Arthur; and get up wiser than you went
down. You've played your little game and your little tricks and
made your little sayings long enough. You're going to stop now.
We've had quite enough of strong men of your stamp, Job
Arthur--quite enough--such Labour leaders as you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You'll be sorry, Mr Barlow--you'll be sorry.
You'll wish you'd not attacked me.</p>

<p>GERALD: Don't you trouble about me and my sorrow. Mind your
own.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You will--you'll be sorry. You'll be sorry for
what you've done. You'll wish you'd never begun this.</p>

<p>GERALD: Begun--begun?--I'd like to finish, too, that I would.
I'd like to finish with you, too--I warn <i>you.</i></p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I warn you--I warn you. You won't go on much
longer. Every parish has its own vermin.</p>

<p>GERALD: Vermin?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Every parish has its own vermin; it lies with
every parish to destroy its own. We shan't have a clean parish
till we've destroyed the vermin we've got.</p>

<p>GERALD: Vermin? The fool's raving. Vermin!--Another
phrase-maker, by God! Another phrase-maker to lead the
people.--Vermin? What vermin? I know quite well what <i>I</i>
mean by vermin, Job Arthur. But what do you mean? Vermin? Explain
yourself.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, vermin. Vermin is what lives on other
people's lives, living on their lives and profiting by it. We've
got 'em in every parish--vermin, I say--that live on the sweat
and blood of the people--live on it, and get rich on it--get rich
through living on other people's lives, the lives of the working
men--living on the bodies of the working men--that's vermin--if
it isn't, what is it? And every parish must destroy its
own--every parish must destroy its own vermin.</p>

<p>GERALD: The phrase, my God! the phrase.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Phrase or no phrase, there it is, and face it out
if you can. There it is--there's not one in every parish--there's
more than one--there's a number--</p>

<p>GERALD (<i>suddenly kicking him</i>): Go! (<i>Kicks him.</i>)
Go! (<i>Kicks him.</i>) Go! (JOB ARTHUR <i>falls.</i>) Get out!
(<i>Kicks him.</i>)Get out, I say! Get out, I tell you! Get out!
Get out!--Vermin!--Vermin!--I'll vermin you! I'll put my foot
through your phrases. Get up, I say, get up and
go--<i>go!</i></p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: It'll be you as'll go, this time.</p>

<p>GERALD: What? What?--By God! I'll kick you out of this park
like a rotten bundle if you don't get up and go.</p>

<p>ANABEL: No, Gerald, no. Don't forget yourself. It's enough
now. It's enough now.--Come away. Do come away. Come away--leave
him--</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR (<i>still on the ground</i>): It's your turn to go.
It's you as'll go, this time.</p>

<p>GERALD (<i>looking at him</i>): One can't even tread on
you.</p>

<p>ANABEL: Don't, Gerald, don't--don't look at him.--Don't say
any more, you, Job Arthur.--Come away, Gerald. Come
away--come--do come.</p>

<p>GERALD (<i>turning</i>): <i>That</i> a human being! My
God!--But he's right--it's I who go. It's we who go, Anabel. He's
still there.--My God! a human being!</p>

<p>CURTAIN</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>SCENE II</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Market-place as in Act I.</i> WILLIE HOUGHTON,
<i>addressing a large crowd of men from the foot of</i> <i>the
obelisk.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>WILLIE: And now you're out on strike--now you've been out for
a week pretty nearly, what further are you? I heard a great deal
of talk about what you were going to do. Well, what <i>are</i>
you going to do? You don't know. You've not the smallest idea.
You haven't any idea whatsoever. You've got your leaders. Now
then, Job Arthur, throw a little light on the way in front, will
you: for it seems to me we're lost in a bog. Which way are we to
steer? Come--give the word, and let's gee-up.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You ask me which way we are to go. I say we can't
go our own way, because of the obstacles that lie in front.
You've got to remove the obstacles from the way.</p>

<p>WILLIE: So said Balaam's ass. But you're not an ass--beg
pardon, and you're not Balaam--you're Job. And we've all got to
be little Jobs, learning how to spell patience backwards. We've
lost our jobs and we've found a Job. It's picking up a scorpion
when you're looking for an egg.--Tell us what you propose doing.
. . . Remove an obstacle from the way! What obstacle? And whose
way?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I think it's pretty plain what the obstacle
is.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Oh ay. Tell us then.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: The obstacle to Labour is Capital.</p>

<p>WILLIE: And how are we going to put salt on Capital's
tail?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: By Labour we mean us working men; and by Capital
we mean those that derive benefit from us, take the cream off us
and leave us the skim.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Oh yes.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: So that, if you're going to remove the obstacle,
you've got to remove the masters, and all that belongs to them.
Does everybody agree with me?</p>

<p>VOICES (<i>loud</i>): Ah, we do--yes--we do that--we do an'
a'--yi--yi--that's it!</p>

<p>WILLIE: Agreed unanimously. But how are we going to do it? Do
you propose to send for Williamson's furniture van, to pack them
in? I should think one pantechnicon would do, just for this
parish. I'll drive. Who'll be the vanmen to lift and carry?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: It's no use fooling. You've fooled for thirty
years, and we're no further. What's got to be done will have to
be begun. It's for every man to sweep in front of his own
doorstep. You can't call your neighbours dirty till you've washed
your own face. Every parish has got its own vermin, and it's the
business of every parish to get rid of its own.</p>

<p>VOICES: That's it--that's it--that's the ticket--that's the
style!</p>

<p>WILLIE: And are you going to comb 'em out, or do you propose
to use Keating's?</p>

<p>VOICES: Shut it! Shut it up! Stop thy face! Hold thy gab!--Go
on, Job Arthur.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: How it's got to be done is for us all to decide.
I'm not one for violence, except it's a force-put. But it's like
this. We've been travelling for years to where we stand now--and
here the road stops. There's only room for one at a time on this
path. There's a precipice below and a rock-face above. And in
front of us stand the masters. Now there's three things we can
do. We can either throw ourselves over the precipice; or we can
lie down and let the masters walk over us; or we can <i>get
on</i>.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Yes. That's alright. But how are you going to get
on?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well--we've either got to throw the obstacle down
the cliff--or walk over it.</p>

<p>VOICES: Ay--ay--ay--yes--that's a fact.</p>

<p>WILLIE: I quite follow you, Job Arthur. You've either got to
do for the masters--or else just remove them, and put them
somewhere else.</p>

<p>VOICES: Ged rid on 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--sink 'em--ha'
done wi' 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--bust the beggars--what do
you do wi' vermin?</p>

<p>WILLIE: Supposing you begin. Supposing you take Gerald Barlow,
and hang him up from this lamp-post, with a piece of coal in his
mouth for a sacrament--</p>

<p>VOICES: Ay--serve him right--serve the beggar right! Shove it
down 's throttle--ay!</p>

<p>WILLIE: Supposing you do it--supposing you've done it--and
supposing you aren't caught and punished--even supposing
that--what are you going to do next? <i>that's</i> the point.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: We know what we're going to do. Once we can get
our hands free, we know what we're going to do.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Yes, so do I. You're either going to make <i>such</i>
a mess that we shall never get out of it--which I don't think you
will do, for the English working man is the soul of obedience and
order, and he'd behave himself to-morrow as if he was at Sunday
school, no matter what he does to-day.--No, what you'll do, Job
Arthur, you'll set up another lot of masters, such a jolly sight
worse than what we've got now. I'd rather be mastered by Gerald
Barlow, if it comes to mastering, than by Job Arthur Freer--oh,
<i>such</i> a lot! You'll be far less free with Job Arthur for
your boss than ever you were with Gerald Barlow. You'll be far
more degraded.--In fact, though I've preached socialism in the
market-place for thirty years--if you're going to start killing
the masters to set yourselves up for bosses--why, kill me along
with the masters. For I'd rather die with somebody who has one
tiny little spark of decency left--though it <i>is</i> a little
tiny spark--than live to triumph with those that have none.</p>

<p>VOICES: Shut thy face, Houghton--shut it up--shut him
up--hustle the beggar! Hoi!--hoi-ee!--whoo!--whoam-it,
whoam-it!--whoo!--bow-wow!--wet-whiskers!--</p>

<p>WILLIE: And it's no use you making fools of
yourselves--(<i>His words are heard through an ugly, jeering,
cold commotion.</i>)</p>

<p>VOICE (<i>loudly</i>): He's comin'.</p>

<p>VOICES: Who?</p>

<p>VOICE: Barlow.--See 's motor?--comin' up--sithee?</p>

<p>WILLIE: If you've any sense left--(<i>Suddenly and violently
disappears.</i>)</p>

<p>VOICES: Sorry!--he's comin'--'s comin'--sorry, ah! Who's
in?--That's Turton drivin'--yi, he's behind wi' a woman--ah, he's
comin'--he'll non go back--hold on. Sorry!--wheer's 'e
comin'?--up from Loddo--ay--(<i>The cries die down--the motor car
slowly comes into sight,</i> OLIVER <i>driving,</i> GERALD
<i>and</i> ANABEL <i>behind. The men stand in a mass in the
way.</i>)</p>

<p>OLIVER: Mind yourself, there. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p>GERALD: Go ahead, Oliver.</p>

<p>VOICE: What's yer 'urry?</p>

<p><i>Crowd sways and surges on the car.</i> OLIVER <i>is
suddenly dragged out.</i> GERALD <i>stands up--he, too, is seized
from behind--he wrestles--is torn out of his great-coat--then
falls--disappears. Loud cries</i>--"Hi!--hoi!--hoi-ee!" <i>all
the while. The car shakes and presses uneasily.</i></p>

<p>VOICE: Stop the blazin' motor, somebody.</p>

<p>VOICE: Here y'are!--hold a minute. (<i>A man jumps in and
stops the engine--he drops in the driver's seat.</i>)</p>

<p>COLLIER (<i>outside the car</i>): Step down, miss.</p>

<p>ANABEL: I am Mrs Barlow.</p>

<p>COLLIER: Missis, then. (<i>Laugh.</i>) Step down--lead 'er
forrard. Take 'em forrard--take 'em forrard.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Ay, make a road.</p>

<p>GERALD: You're makin' a proper fool of yourself now,
Freer.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You've brought it on yourself. <i>You've</i> made
fools of plenty of men.</p>

<p>COLLIERS: Come on, now--come on! Whoa!--whoa!--he's a
jibber--go pretty now, go pretty!</p>

<p>VOICES (<i>suddenly</i>): Lay hold o' Houghton--nab 'im--seize
'im--rats!--rats!--bring 'im forrard!</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>in a loud, clear voice</i>): I never knew anything
so <i>ridiculous.</i></p>

<p>VOICES (<i>falsetto</i>): Ridiculous! Oh, ridiculous! Mind the
step, dear!--I'm Mrs Barlow!--Oh, are you?--Tweet--tweet!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Make a space, boys, make a space. (<i>He stands
with prisoners in a cleared space before the obelisk.</i>)
Now--now--quiet a minute--we want to ask a few questions of these
gentlemen.</p>

<p>VOICES: Quiet!--quiet--Sh-h-h! Sh-h-h!--Answer pretty--answer
pretty now!--Quiet!--Shh-h-h!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: We want to ask you, Mr Gerald Barlow, why you have
given occasion for this present trouble?</p>

<p>GERALD: You are a fool.</p>

<p>VOICES: Oh!--oh!--naughty Barlow!--naughty baa-lamb--answer
pretty--answer pretty--be good baa-lamb--baa--baa!--answer pretty
when gentleman asks you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Quiet a bit. Sh-h-h!--We put this plain question
to you, Mr Barlow. Why did you refuse to give the clerks this
just and fair advance, when you knew that by refusing you would
throw three thousand men out of employment?</p>

<p>GERALD: You are a fool, I say.</p>

<p>VOICES: Oh!--oh!--won't do--won't do, Barlow--wrong
answer--wrong answer--be good baa-lamb--naughty boy--naughty
boy!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Quiet a bit--now!--If three thousand men ask you a
just, straightforward question, do you consider they've no right
to an answer?</p>

<p>GERALD: I would answer you with my foot.</p>

<p>VOICES (<i>amid a threatening scuffle</i>): Da-di-da! Hark
ye--hark ye! Oh--whoa--whoa a bit!--won't do!--won't
do!--naughty--naughty--say you're sorry--say you're sorry--kneel
and say you're sorry--kneel and beg pardon!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Hold on a bit--keep clear!</p>

<p>VOICES: Make him kneel--make him kneel--on his knees with
him!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I think you'd better kneel down.</p>

<p><i>The crowd press on</i> GERALD--<i>he struggles--they hit
him behind the knees, force him down.</i></p>

<p>OLIVER: This is shameful and unnecessary.</p>

<p>VOICES: All of 'em--on your knees--all of 'em--on their
knees!</p>

<p><i>They seize</i> OLIVER <i>and</i> WILLIE <i>and</i> ANABEL,
<i>hustling.</i> ANABEL <i>kneels quietly--the others
struggle.</i></p>

<p>WILLIE: Well, of all the damned, dirty, cowardly--</p>

<p>VOICES: Shut up, Houghton--shut him up--squeeze him!</p>

<p>OLIVER: Get off me--let me alone--I'll kneel.</p>

<p>VOICES: Good little doggies--nice doggies--kneel and beg
pardon--yap-yap--answer--make him answer!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR (<i>holding up his hand for silence</i>): It would
be better if you answered straight off, Barlow. We want to know
why you prevented that advance?</p>

<p>VOICES (<i>after a pause</i>): Nip his neck! Make him
yelp!</p>

<p>OLIVER: Let me answer, then.--Because it's worse, perhaps, to
be bullied by three thousand men than by one man.</p>

<p>VOICES: Oh!--oh!--dog keeps barking--stuff his mouth--stop him
up--here's a bit of paper--answer. Barlow--nip his neck--stuff
his mug--make him yelp--cork the bottle!</p>

<p><i>They press a lump of newspaper into</i> OLIVER'S <i>mouth,
and bear down on</i> GERALD.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Quiet--quiet--quiet--a minute, everybody. We give
him a minute--we give him a minute to answer.</p>

<p>VOICES: Give him a minute--a holy minute--say your prayers,
Barlow--you've got a minute--tick-tick, says the clock--time
him!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Keep quiet.</p>

<p>WILLIE: Of all the damned, cowardly--</p>

<p>VOICES: Sh-h-h!--Squeeze him--throttle him! Silence is golden,
Houghton.--Close the shutters, Willie's dead.--Dry up,
wet-whiskers!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You've fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>VOICES: There's a long, long trail a-winding--</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: The minute's up.--We ask you again, Gerald Barlow,
why you refused a just and fair demand, when you know it was
against the wishes of three thousand men all as good as
yourself?</p>

<p>VOICES: And a sight better--I don't think--we're not all
vermin-- we're not all crawlers, living off the sweat of other
folks--we're not all parish vermin--parish vermin.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: And on what grounds you think you have no occasion
to answer the straightforward question we put you here?</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>after a pause</i>): Answer them, Gerald. What's the
use of prolonging this?</p>

<p>GERALD: I've nothing to answer.</p>

<p>VOICES: Nothing to answer--Gerald, darling--Gerald,
duckie--oh, lovey-dovey--I've nothing to answer--no, by God--no,
by God, he hasna--nowt to answer--ma'e him find summat,
then--answer for him--gi'e him 's answer--let him ha'e it--go
on--mum--mum--lovey-dovey--rub his nose in it--kiss the dirt,
ducky--bend him down--rub his nose in--he's saying something--oh
no, he isn't--sorry I spoke--bend him down!</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Quiet a bit--quiet, everybody--he's got to
answer--keep quiet.--Now--(<i>A silence.</i>) Now then, Barlow,
will you answer, or won't you? (<i>Silence.</i>)</p>

<p>ANABEL: Answer them, Gerald--never mind.</p>

<p>VOICES: Sh-h-h! Sh-h-h! (<i>Silence.</i>)</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You won't answer, Barlow?</p>

<p>VOICE: Down the beggar!</p>

<p>VOICES: Down him--put his nose down--flatten him!</p>

<p><i>The crowd surges and begins to howl--they sway
dangerously</i>--GERALD <i>is spread-eagled on the ground, face
down.</i></p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Back--back--back a minute--back--back! (<i>They
recoil.</i>)</p>

<p>WILLIE: I <i>hope</i> there's a God in heaven.</p>

<p>VOICES: Put him down--flatten him!</p>

<p>WILLIE <i>is flattened on the ground.</i></p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Now then--now then--if you won't answer, Barlow, I
can't stand here for you any more.--Take your feet off him, boys,
and turn him over. Turn him over--let us look at him. Let us see
if he <i>can</i> speak. (<i>They turn him over, with another
scuffle.</i>) Now then, Barlow--you can see the sky above you.
Now do you think you're going to play with three thousand men,
with their lives and with their souls?--now do you think you're
going to answer them with your foot?--do you--do you?</p>

<p><i>The crowd has begun to sway and heave dangerously, with a
low, muffled roar, above which is heard</i> JOB ARTHUR'S
<i>voice. As he ceases, the roar breaks into a yell--the crowd
heaves.</i></p>

<p>VOICES: Down him--crack the vermin--on top of him--put your
foot on the vermin!</p>

<p>ANABEL (<i>with a loud, piercing cry, suddenly starting
up</i>): Ah no! Ah no! Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o! Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o!
Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o! No-o-o-o! No-o-o-o! No-o!
No-o-o!--Ah-h-h-h!--it's enough, it's enough, it's enough! It's
enough--he's a man as you are. He's a man as you are. He's a man
as you are. He's a man as you are. (<i>Weeps--a breath of
silence.</i>)</p>

<p>OLIVER: Let us stop now--let us stop now. Let me stand up.
(<i>Silence.</i>) I want to stand up. (<i>A muffled
noise.</i>)</p>

<p>VOICE: Let him get up. (OLIVER <i>rises.</i>)</p>

<p>OLIVER: Be quiet. Be quiet.--Now--choose! Choose! Choose!
Choose what you will do! Only choose! Choose!--it will be
irrevocable. (<i>A moment's pause.</i>) Thank God we haven't gone
too far.--Gerald, get up. (<i>Men still hold him down.</i>)</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Isn't he to answer us? Isn't he going to answer
us?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Yes, he shall answer you. He shall answer you. But let
him stand up. No more of this. Let him stand up. He must stand
up. (<i>Men still hold</i> GERALD <i>down.</i> OLIVER <i>takes
hold of their hands and removes them.</i>) Let go--let go now.
Yes, let go--yes--I ask you to let go. (<i>Slowly, sullenly, the
men let go.</i> GERALD <i>is free, but he does not move.</i>)
There--get up, Gerald! Get up! You aren't hurt, are you? You must
get up--it's no use. We're doing our best--you must do yours.
When things are like this, we have to put up with what we get.
(GERALD <i>rises slowly and faces the mob. They roar dully.</i>)
You ask why the clerks didn't get this increase? Wait! Wait! Do
you still wish for any answer, Mr Freer?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Yes, that's what we've been waiting for.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Then answer, Gerald.</p>

<p>GERALD: They've trodden on my face.</p>

<p>OLIVER: No matter. Job Arthur will easily answer that you've
trodden on their souls. Don't start an altercation. (<i>The crowd
is beginning to roar.</i>)</p>

<p>GERALD: You want to know why the clerks didn't get their
rise?--Because you interfered and attempted to bully about it, do
you see. That's why.</p>

<p>VOICES: You want bullying.--You'll get bullying, you will.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Can't you see it's no good, either side? It's no
mortal use. We might as well all die to-morrow, or to-day, or
this minute, as go on bullying one another, one side bullying the
other side, and the other side bullying back. We'd <i>better</i>
all die.</p>

<p>WILLIE: And a great deal better. I'm damned if I'll take sides
with anybody against anything, after this. If I'm to die, I'll
die by myself. As for living, it seems impossible.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Have the men nothing to be said for their
side?</p>

<p>OLIVER: They have a great deal--but not <i>everything,</i> you
see.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Haven't they been wronged? And <i>aren't</i> they
wronged?</p>

<p>OLIVER: They have--and they are. But haven't they been wrong
themselves, too?--and aren't they wrong now?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: How?</p>

<p>OLIVER: What about this affair? Do you call it right?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Haven't we been driven to it?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Partly. And haven't you driven the masters to it, as
well?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: I don't see that.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Can't you see that it takes two to make a quarrel? And
as long as each party hangs on to its own end of the stick, and
struggles to get full hold of the stick, the quarrel will
continue. It will continue till you've killed one another. And
even then, what better shall you be? What better would you be,
really, if you'd killed Gerald Barlow just now? You wouldn't, you
know. We're all human beings, after all. And why can't we try
really to leave off struggling against one another, and set up a
new state of things?</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: That's all very well, you see, while you've got
the goods.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I've got very little, I assure you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: Well, if you haven't, those you mix with have.
They've got the money, and the power, and they intend to keep
it.</p>

<p>OLIVER: As for power, somebody must have it, you know. It only
rests with you to put it into the hands of the best men, the men
you <i>really</i> believe in.--And as for money, it's life, it's
living that matters, not simply having money.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You can't live without money.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I know that. And therefore why can't we have the
decency to agree simply about money--just agree to dispose of it
so that all men could live their own lives.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: That's what we want to do. But the others, such as
Gerald Barlow, they keep the money--<i>and</i> the power.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You see, if you wanted to arrange things so that money
flowed more naturally, so that it flowed naturally to every man,
according to his needs, I think we could all soon agree. But you
don't. What you want is to take it away from one set and give it
to another--or keep it yourselves.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: We want every man to have his proper share.</p>

<p>OLIVER: I'm sure <i>I</i> do. I want every man to be able to
live and be free. But we shall never manage it by fighting over
the money. If you want what is natural and good, I'm sure the
owners would soon agree with you.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: What? Gerald Barlow agree with us?</p>

<p>OLIVER: Why not? I believe so.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: You ask him.</p>

<p>OLIVER: Do you think, Gerald, that if the men really wanted a
whole, better way, you would agree with them?</p>

<p>GERALD: I want a better way myself--but not their way.</p>

<p>JOB ARTHUR: There, you see!</p>

<p>VOICES: Ah-h! look you!--That's him--that's him all over.</p>

<p>OLIVER: You want a better way,--but not his way: he wants a
better way--but not your way. Why can't you both drop your buts,
and simply say you want a better way, and believe yourselves and
one another when you say it? Why can't you?</p>

<p>GERALD: Look here! I'm quite as tired of my way of life as you
are of yours. If you make me believe you want something better,
then I assure you I do: I want what you want. But Job Arthur
Freer's not the man to lead you to anything better. You can tell
what people want by the leaders they choose, do you see? You
choose leaders whom I respect, and I'll respect you, do you see?
As it is, I don't. And now I'm going.</p>

<p>VOICES: Who says?--Oh ay!--Who says goin'?</p>

<p>GERALD: Yes, I'm going. About this affair here we'll cry
quits; no more said about it. About a new way of life, a better
way all round--I tell you I want it and need it as much as ever
you do. I don't care about money really. But I'm never going to
be bullied.</p>

<p>VOICE: Who doesn't care about money?</p>

<p>GERALD: I don't. I think we ought to be able to alter the
whole system--but not by bullying, not because one lot wants what
the other has got.</p>

<p>VOICE: No, because you've got everything.</p>

<p>GERALD: Where's my coat? Now then, step out of the way.</p>

<p><i>They move towards the car.</i></p>
