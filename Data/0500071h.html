A Project Gutenberg of Australia eBook

Title: The Indian Cookery Book (c.1900)
Author: Anonymous
eBook No.: 0500071h.html
Language: English
Character set encoding: HTML--Latin-1(ISO-8859-1)--8 bit
Date first posted: January 2005
Date most recently updated: January 2005

The plain text version of this eBook was produced by John Bickers and Dagny
The original book contained no illustrations.

The html version was produced by Col Choat. Images were taken from
"Following the Equator", by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)
(See http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/8/9/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm)

Production note:

This text was prepared from an undated edition. There are two
facts that imply this edition was published before 1900. Firstly,
the first chapter refers to cyclones in 1864 and 1867 as recent
events. Secondly, the book is interleaved with pages of notepaper
for readers to add their own recipes, and one of these recipes
ends with a note that the recipe was cooked in 1899.

<h2>THE RECIPES</h2>

<h3><a name="H1" id="H1"></a>RICE OR CHOWL</h3>

<p>Rice is consumed by most European families at breakfast, tiffin,
and dinner. It is eaten at breakfast with fried meat, fish, omelet,
country captain, or some other curried dish, and, being invariably
followed by toast and eggs, jams, fruit, &amp;c., one
<i>coonkee</i>, which contains about as much as an ordinary
breakfast-cup, or say half a pound, will always be ample for four
tolerably hearty consumers. There are two sizes of <i>coonkees</i>,
large and small: reference is here made to the <i>small
coonkee</i>, well filled. The quantity, however, of raw rice for a
party of four should not exceed half a pound.</p>

<p>The rice at dinner is usually preceded by soup, fish, roast, and
made dishes.</p>

<p>The best or generally approved qualities of rice for table use
are known as the bhaktoolsee, the banafool, the bassmuttee, and
cheeneesuckur. In purchasing these, or indeed any other approved
quality, care must be taken to avoid <i>new rice</i> and what is
called <i>urruah</i>, which latter has been put through some
process of boiling, or damped, and then dried. Both are considered
unwholesome for general daily consumption, and few Indians will use
them.</p>

<p>Good rice when rubbed in the palm of the hand, and cleared of
dust, will appear of a bright and nearly transparent yellowish
colour; whereas the <i>urruah</i> will be found of a dull whitish
hue, and the grain streaked and speckled with white powder, which
crumbles on the application of a needle's point.</p>

<p>The price of rice, like other commodities, varies according to
its plenty or scarcity in the market. After the cyclone of October,
1864, and again of November, 1867, the price of the bhaktoolsee and
the banafool, which are fine, large, stout-grain rice, without
being coarse, ruled at from eight to nine seers per rupee, and the
bassmuttee and the cheeneesuckur at from seven to eight seers per
rupee. The rice used by the poorest classes of the native
population is of a very coarse description and incredibly cheap:
within six weeks after the cyclone of November, 1867, it was
readily procurable at twenty-five to thirty seers per rupee.</p>

<p>Rice is used in a variety of forms: it is boiled, made into
kitcheeree, pellow, puddings, blanc mange, cakes, bread,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The bhaktoolsee, the banafool, and other stout-grain rice are
the best adapted for boiling. Boiled rice is called
<i>bhath</i>.</p>

<p>The bassmuttee, cheeneesuckur, and all small and fine-grain rice
are selected for kitcheeree, pellow, and puddings for children's
food, and for invalids.</p>

<p>The <i>urruah</i> is used in some houses in ignorance, but for
the most part it is made into flour, and used for blanc mange,
cakes, &amp;c. The flour is abundantly procurable in the Calcutta
markets, and is largely used by all native bakers in the making of
bread.</p>

<p>Twenty-two to twenty-five seers of rice monthly, consuming it
three times a day, entertainments included, will be ample for a
party of four, allowing occasionally for a rice pudding.</p>

<p>It is necessary to wash rice thoroughly in several waters before
using it, and a colander is very useful for draining away the water
after washing the rice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R1" id="R1"></a>1.&mdash;Boiled Rice</b>
</p>

<p>Wash half a pound or a coonkeeful of rice, and put it to boil in
a large quantity of water, over a brisk fire. Immediately the rice
begins to boil, the water will bubble up to the surface of the pot
and overflow, carrying away quantities of scum and impurities. The
cover of the pot should now be kept partially open, and the rice
stirred to prevent an entire overflow of the water. On the
subsiding of the water or the bubbling, the fire should be reduced,
until it is satisfactorily ascertained that the grains of rice,
without being pappy, are quite soft, when the pot should be removed
from the fire and a quart of cold water be added. All the liquid,
which is "conjee," should then be drained, and the pot replaced
over a gentle charcoal heat, to allow all moisture to evaporate,
assisting the process by occasionally shaking the pot, or stirring
its contents gently with a wooden spoon. Time to boil: half an
hour.</p>

<p>The coonkee of rice when properly boiled will fill a good-sized
curry or vegetable dish. The rice will be found quite soft, and yet
every grain perfectly separate. Rice should never be cooked into a
pap, excepting it is required for very young children; and leaving
the grains hard or uncooked should be equally avoided.</p>

<p>A small pinch of pounded alum or <i>fitkerree</i> is used by
some cooks with advantage to improve the whiteness of boiled
rice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R2" id="R2"></a>2.&mdash;Rice Conjee</b>
</p>

<p>The water in which rice is boiled should never be thrown away:
it is nutritious and fattening for all cattle, horses included, and
may be given daily to milch cows and goats with great
advantage.</p>

<p><b><a name="R3" id="R3"></a>3.&mdash;Rice Kheer</b>
</p>

<p>This is occasionally served upon the breakfast-table as a treat,
but few Europeans care for it. It is made as
follows:&mdash;Thoroughly boil one coonkee or half a pound of the
bassmuttee or the cheeneesuckur rice, then drain the water away,
add two cups of pure cow's milk, and put over a slow fire. As the
rice begins to absorb the milk, two or three small sticks of
cinnamon are put in, with one tablespoonful and a half to two
tablespoonfuls of fine-quality white sugar. On the milk being
entirely absorbed, the kheer is either turned out upon a dish and
eaten hot, or put into a buttered mould, served up in shape, and
eaten cold.</p>

<p>Kheer is sometimes cooked or boiled in milk only, but the
foregoing recipe is supposed to be that more generally
approved.</p>

<p><b><a name="R4" id="R4"></a>4.&mdash;Pish-Pash</b>
</p>

<p>Pick and wash in several waters a coonkee or half a pound of the
bassmuttee or other fine-grain rice; add to it, cleaned and cut up,
a chicken, some sliced ginger, sliced onions, a few bay-leaves,
some peppercorns, a few hotspice, a dessertspoonful of salt, one
chittack or two ounces of butter, and water sufficient to cover the
whole. Simmer over a slow fire until the chicken becomes perfectly
tender and the rice quite pappy. Serve up hot. This is considered a
most excellent and nutritious meal for invalids.</p>

<h3><a name="H2" id="H2"></a>KITCHEEREES</h3>

<p>These are occasionally substituted for boiled rice at breakfast,
and are eaten with fried fish, omelets, croquets, jhal frezee,
&amp;c. They are prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="R5" id="R5"></a>5.&mdash;Bhoonee Kitcheeree</b>
</p>

<p>Take rather more than three-quarters of a coonkee of bassmuttee
or cheeneesuckur and half a coonkee of dal; or, if preferred, take
the rice and dal in equal parts.</p>

<p>Take twelve large curry onions and cut them up lengthways into
fine slices. Warm up two chittacks or four ounces of ghee (but
before doing so be careful to warm the pot), and, while bubbling,
throw in the sliced onions, removing them immediately they become
of a bright brown colour. Set the fried onions aside, and throw in
the dal and rice (having previously allowed all the water in which
they were washed to drain through a colander). Fry until the dal
and rice have absorbed all the ghee; then add a few slices of green
ginger, some peppercorns, salt to taste (say one dessertspoonful),
a few cloves, three or four cardamoms, half a dozen bay-leaves, and
as many small sticks of cinnamon. Mix well together; add as much
water only as will entirely cover over the whole of the rice and
dal, put a good-fitting cover on, and set over a slow fire,
reducing the same from time to time as the water is being absorbed.
Care must be taken not to allow the kitcheeree to burn, which may
be prevented by occasionally shaking the pot, or stirring its
contents with a wooden spoon.</p>

<p>Serve up quite hot, strewing over it the fried onions, which
serve both as a relish and garnish of the dish.</p>

<p><b><a name="R6" id="R6"></a>6.&mdash;Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the
Mussoor or Red Dal is made according to recipe No. 5.</b>
</p>

<p><b><a name="R7" id="R7"></a>7.&mdash;Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the
Moong or Small-grain Yellow Dal is made according to recipe No.
5.</b>
</p>

<p><b><a name="R8" id="R8"></a>8.&mdash;Bhoonee Kitcheeree of the
Gram or Chunna Dal</b>
</p>

<p>The chunna or gram dal makes a very nice kitcheeree; but, as it
is rather hard, it should be boiled or soaked in cold water for an
hour or so before frying it with the raw rice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R9" id="R9"></a>9.&mdash;Bhoonee Kitcheeree of Green
Peas</b>
</p>

<p>Kitcheeree made of green peas grown of English seeds is a
rarity. Large peas should be picked out and shelled; they should
not be fried with the rice, but added to it when nearly cooked. The
instructions given in recipe No. 5 are to be observed in all other
respects.</p>

<p><b><a name="R10" id="R10"></a>10.&mdash;Jurrud or Yellow-tinted
Kitcheeree</b>
</p>

<p>Jurrud or yellow-tinted kitcheeree is nothing more than one of
the above kitcheerees, to which is added, at the time of frying the
rice and dal, either a small quantity of saffron or turmeric,
according to the colour desired to be imparted. Such introduction
in no way affects the flavour, nor does it render the appearance of
the dish more attractive, but serves admirably as a variety for a
large breakfast-table.</p>

<p><b><a name="R11" id="R11"></a>11.&mdash;Geela Kitcheeree</b>
</p>

<p>This is usually made of moong dal with less than one-fourth the
quantity of ghee allowed for the bhoonee, or with no ghee at all,
and little or no condiments are used, excepting a small quantity of
finely-sliced green ginger, a few peppercorns, one or two
bay-leaves, and salt to taste. It is supposed to be better adapted
than bhoonee kitcheeree for children and invalids.</p>

<p>By <i>bhoonee</i> is meant crisp, and <i>geela</i> signifies
soft.</p>

<h3><a name="H3" id="H3"></a>PELLOW OR POOLOO</h3>

<p>Pellows are purely Hindoostanee dishes. There are several kinds
of pellow, but some of them are so entirely of an Asiatic character
and taste that no European will ever be persuaded to partake of
them. It is therefore considered useless to offer instructions how
to prepare such as the <i>ukhnee pellow</i>, in which are
introduced cream, milk, butter-milk, garlic, and lime-juice; or the
<i>sweet pellow</i>, in which almonds and raisins are introduced,
in addition to sugar, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following are the pellows in general use:&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="R12" id="R12"></a>12.&mdash;Chicken Pellow</b>
</p>

<p>Take a good-sized chicken; clean, truss, and boil it with one
pound of beef in two cupfuls of clean water, seasoning it with
onions, ginger, and salt. When sufficiently cooked, but yet quite
firm, remove the chicken, and set it and the gravy aside. Cut up
twelve onions lengthways into fine slices. Warm your pot; then melt
in it two chittacks or four ounces of ghee, and, as it bubbles,
throw in the sliced onions and fry to a light brown; remove and set
aside. Then put in half a pound, or a coonkee, or the best
bassmuttee or cheeneesuckur, having drained away all the water in
which it was washed, and fry. On the rice absorbing the ghee, throw
in a few cloves, four or five cardamoms, half a dozen small sticks
of cinnamon, some peppercorns, a blade or two of mace, and one
dessertspoonful of salt. Mix up the whole, and pour over it the
gravy in which the chicken and beef were boiled, or as much of it
only as will entirely cover the rice; close the pot immediately
with a close-fitting cover, and set on a slow fire. As the gravy
continues to decrease or to be absorbed, so keep reducing the fire,
shaking up the pot occasionally, or stirring its contents, to
prevent the pellow from burning. Brown the boiled chicken in a pan
with ghee or butter, and serve up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Place the chicken, either whole or cut up, on the centre of a
dish, covering it with the pellow; strew over it the fried onions,
garnishing it besides with two hard-boiled eggs, cut into halves,
or in some device, and with half a dozen bits of finely-sliced and
fried bacon, to suit the taste of those who like the latter.</p>

<p><b><a name="R13" id="R13"></a>13.&mdash;Beef, Mutton, or Kid
Pellow</b>
</p>

<p>Take two pounds of beef, and cut up as for a curry, or take a
small but good leg of mutton, or two legs of a kid, rejecting the
loin.</p>

<p>Make a good, strong gravy with seasoning of sliced onions,
ginger, and salt, with water, which when cooked down will be
reduced to about sufficient only to cover the rice. Then proceed to
make the pellow in all respects as directed in the foregoing
recipe. The beef is not further used for the table, but treat the
legs of the kid, or the mutton, the same as the chicken, and serve
up with fried onions, hard-boiled eggs, and fried bacon, like the
chicken pellow.</p>

<p><b><a name="R14" id="R14"></a>14.&mdash;Prawn Pellow</b>
</p>

<p>Instead of a chicken, provide yourself with eight or ten
good-sized "bagda prawns," and a good hard cocoanut. After frying
and setting aside the sliced onions, as directed above, the rice is
to be fried, but, instead of using chicken or any other meat broth,
cook it in the milk of the cocoanut (<i>vide</i> recipe No. 54),
observing in all particulars the instructions given for the chicken
pellow, recipe No. 12, and serve up as follows:&mdash;Dish up the
pellow, strew over it the fried onions, and garnish with the prawns
finely boiled, and two hard-boiled eggs cut in halves or in some
other device.</p>

<p>The cocoanut milk will impart a sweetish flavour to the pellow,
but it is not disagreeable; and its sweetness may be subdued, if
required, by reducing the strength of the cocoanut milk.</p>

<p><b><a name="R15" id="R15"></a>15.&mdash;Lobster or Fish
Pellow</b>
</p>

<p>Take out the centre bones or one or two hilsa or beckty fishes,
which are procurable fresh and good in the market, and eight or ten
large long-legged lobsters with the roe or coral; thoroughly wash
in several waters with salt, and boil with plenty of seasoning of
onions, sliced ginger, peppercorns, a dozen bay-leaves, a
tablespoonful of unroasted dhuniah or coriander seed, and salt,
with water sufficient to give the required quantity of gravy. When
ready, remove and shell the lobsters, reserving the roe or red
coral in the heads, which bruise down with a little unroasted
coriander seed, and mix with the fish gravy. Make the pellow in all
other respects the same as prawn pellow, using the gravy of the
fish instead of cocoanut or other gravy, and garnish with the
lobsters, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><a name="H4" id="H4"></a>CURRIES</h3>

<p>A curry-stone and muller, or what the natives call <i>seal our
lurriah</i>, are necessary for the preparation of condiments for
daily use. The condiments should be carefully, and each kind
separately, ground down to a nice paste with a little water.</p>

<p>Condiments prepared with water will not keep good any number of
days; if required for a journey, therefore, or as presents for
friends at home, good sweet oil and the best English vinegar should
be substituted for the water. For the preparation of condiments for
this purpose see recipe No. 65.</p>

<p>The first cost of a curry-stone and muller of large size will
not exceed one rupee, but they will require re-cutting every three
or four months, at a cost not exceeding one anna each
re-setting.</p>

<p>The following is a list of curry condiments and hotspice in
almost daily use:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
Curry onions, or <i>carree ka piaj</i>, price from 3 to 8 pice per seer.
Turmeric, or <i>huldee</i>   "     3 to 5 annas   "
Garlic, or <i>lussoon</i>    "     2 to 3 annas   "
Green ginger, or <i>uddruck</i>  "     2 to 4 annas   "
Dry chilies, or <i>sooka mirritch</i>  "     3 to 5 annas   "
Coriander-seed, or <i>dhunnia</i>"     3 to 4 annas   "
Cumin-seed, or <i>jeerah</i> "     5 to 6 annas   "
Peppercorns, or <i>gool mirritch</i>   "     5 to 6 annas   "
Bay-leaves, or <i>tage paththa</i>     "     2 to 3 annas   "
Lemon-grass, or <i>uggheaghass</i>     "     3 to 6 pice for a
bundle of 16 to 20 blades of grass.
Poppy-seed, or <i>post ka danna</i>    "     3 to 4 annas per seer.
Onion-seed, or <i>cullinga</i>   "     5 to 8 annas   "
Stick cinnamon, or <i>dalcheenee</i>  -+
Cardamoms, or <i>elachee</i>     |   Mixed; prices range from Rs.
Cloves, or <i>loung</i>+-  3-14 to 4 per seer.
Nutmeg, or <i>jyephall</i> |
Mace, or <i>jowttree</i>  -+
</pre>

<p>However high prices may range, one rupee-worth of mixed
condiments, including hotspice, will suffice for a month's
consumption for a party of from four to six adults, allowing for
three curries per day, cutlets and made dishes included.</p>

<h3><a name="H5" id="H5"></a>GRAVY CURRIES</h3>

<p>The following directions for an every-day gravy chicken curry
will apply equally to all ordinary meat gravy curries:&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="R16" id="R16"></a>16.&mdash;Chicken Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take one chittack or two ounces of ghee, two breakfast-cupfuls
of water, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of
ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground turmeric and chilies,
half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, and a quarter of a teaspoonful
of ground garlic.</p>

<p>To suit the taste of those who like it, half a teaspoonful of
ground coriander-seed may be added, which should be roasted before
being ground. Observe the following directions for
cooking:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take the usual full-sized curry chicken, the price of which has
latterly ranged from three to four annas, and divide it into
sixteen or eighteen pieces. Warm the pot, melt in it the ghee, and
immediately it begins to bubble throw in all the ground condiments,
stirring until quite brown; then put in the cut-up chicken and the
salt, and stir up to a good light-brown colour; then add the water,
and allow the whole to simmer over a slow fire until the chicken is
quite tender, and the liquid reduced to about half its original
quantity. The operation of cooking or simmering will take from a
half to three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R17" id="R17"></a>17.&mdash;Kid Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take a hind-quarter or a fore-quarter of kid, which may be
obtained at from three to four annas the quarter; cut it up into
sixteen or eighteen pieces; take condiments in the proportion given
in recipe No. 16, and cook it in every particular the same as the
chicken curry, allowing it to simmer three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R18" id="R18"></a>18.&mdash;Veal Curry</b>
</p>

<p>A small shoulder of veal, the price of which ranges from three
to four annas, may be selected; cut off from it sixteen or eighteen
one-inch square pieces of the best part of the meat, and curry it
in every particular the same as a chicken, only allowing it to
simmer half to three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R19" id="R19"></a>19.&mdash;Mutton Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Obtain a small shoulder at from five to six annas; cut it up
into sixteen or eighteen one-inch square pieces, rejecting all the
bones; curry it the same as a chicken, allowing it to simmer for
half an hour longer, or until the meat is tender.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The bones of the veal and mutton, referred to in this
and the foregoing recipe, may be turned to account for stock or
gravy for some made dish.</p>

<p><b><a name="R20" id="R20"></a>20.&mdash;Beef Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Two pounds of well-selected meat will cost from three to four
annas; cut it up into one-inch square pieces, rejecting all the
scraggy parts; cook it in every respect according to the
instructions given in recipe No. 16 for cooking a gravy chicken
curry, only allowing it to simmer for a much longer time than any
other curry, or until the beef becomes tender.</p>

<p><b><a name="R21" id="R21"></a>21.&mdash;Green Duck Curry</b>
</p>

<p>The price of a young tender duck may be quoted at from four to
five annas. Cut it up exactly as you would a chicken, and curry it
in the same manner, allowing it to simmer for an hour and a half.
It is desirable to introduce half a teaspoonful each of coriander
and cumin seeds in this curry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R22" id="R22"></a>22.&mdash;Young Pigeon Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take four young pigeons; cut each into four pieces, making in
all sixteen pieces. The price of young pigeons ranges from five to
six annas the pair. The instructions given for the cooking of a
gravy chicken curry apply equally to a pigeon curry.</p>

<h3><a name="H6" id="H6"></a>DOOPIAJAS</h3>

<p>The literal translation of <i>doopiaja</i> is "two onions," and
the term probably is correctly applicable, as it will be noticed,
in the recipes for preparing the <i>doopiaja curries</i>, that
besides the full quantity of ground onions, it is necessary to put
in about an equal quantity of fried onions, thereby <i>doubling</i>
the quantity of onions.</p>

<p>Doopiajas are more piquant curries; they are cooked with more
ghee and less water. The following condiments, &amp;c., are
considered ample for a really good <i>doopiaja</i> of chicken or of
any meat:&mdash;</p>

<p>One chittack and a half or three ounces of ghee, one
breakfast-cupful of water, one teaspoonful and a half of salt, four
teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground
turmeric and chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a
quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, twelve onions cut
lengthways, each into six or eight slices, and half a teaspoonful
of ground coriander-seed if it be liked.</p>

<p><b><a name="R23" id="R23"></a>23.&mdash;Chicken Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take a full-sized curry chicken and divide it into sixteen or
eighteen pieces. Melt the ghee in a warm or heated pot, fry brown
the sliced onions and set aside; then fry the ground condiments,
stirring the whole; when brown, add the cut-up chicken with the
salt, and fry to a rich brown. Chop the fried onions and put into
the pot with one cup of water, and allow to simmer over a slow fire
for about one hour, when the chicken will be perfectly tender, and
the liquid reduced to a thick consistency, and to half its original
quantity.</p>

<p><b><a name="R24" id="R24"></a>24.&mdash;Kid Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Is made in all respects as a chicken doopiaja, the kid to be cut
up in the usual manner. The hind quarter is preferable to the fore
quarter.</p>

<p><b><a name="R25" id="R25"></a>25.&mdash;Veal Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take only the meat from a shoulder, cut it up into squares, and
allow it to simmer for half an hour longer than the chicken
doopiaja.</p>

<p><b><a name="R26" id="R26"></a>26.&mdash;Mutton Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>The flesh part of a shoulder is cut up into squares and
doopiajed exactly as a chicken, allowing it to simmer over a slow
fire for half an hour longer.</p>

<p><b><a name="R27" id="R27"></a>27.&mdash;Beef Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Cut two pounds of beef into one-inch square pieces, and follow
all the instructions given in recipe No. 23, only allowing it to
simmer for a much longer time over a slow fire, until the beef is
perfectly tender.</p>

<p><b><a name="R28" id="R28"></a>28.&mdash;Duck Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Divide as you would a chicken, and cook the duck in the same
manner, allowing it to simmer a little longer than the chicken
doopiaja. Half a teaspoonful each of ground coriander and cumin
seed should be mixed with the condiments.</p>

<p><b><a name="R29" id="R29"></a>29.&mdash;Doopiaja of Pigeons</b>
</p>

<p>Take four pigeons, cut each into four pieces, and proceed in
every particular the same as for a chicken doopiaja.</p>

<p><b><a name="R30" id="R30"></a>30.&mdash;Cold Boiled Pork
Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Cut from the remains of cold boiled pork sixteen one-inch square
pieces, and doopiaje it in the way directed for a chicken. The time
required to simmer will not exceed that allowed for the chicken
doopiaja.</p>

<p><b><a name="R31" id="R31"></a>31.&mdash;Udder Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take two pounds of udder; before cutting it into squares, it
should be parboiled, and then made into doopiaja, allowing it to
simmer over a slow fire for about two hours.</p>

<p><b><a name="R32" id="R32"></a>32.&mdash;Udder and Beef
Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take one pound each of udder and beef; parboil the udder, and
then cut it up with the beef into one-inch square pieces, and
doopiaje it, allowing it to simmer for about two hours.</p>

<p>It is necessary to impress on the amateur artist the importance
of paying particular attention to the firing: a brisk fire will dry
up the ghee and the water before the curry is half cooked, and
necessitate the addition of more water, which will in every
instance spoil the doopiaja, although the addition of a little
water, if such be necessary when the curry is nearly cooked, will
do it no harm. In every instance where ghee butter, &amp;c., is to
be melted, it is desirable first to warm the pot.</p>

<h3><a name="H7" id="H7"></a>FORCEMEAT BALL CURRIES, OR
COFTA-KA-CARREE</h3>

<p>Beef, mutton, chicken, fish, crabs, and prawns are usually taken
for making these curries. The ingredients for two pounds of meat or
fish are as follow:&mdash;Lard, ghee, or mustard oil, three to four
ounces; water or stock, five to six ounces; ground onions, one
tablespoonful or one ounce; ground chilies, a quarter of a
tablespoonful, ground turmeric, a quarter of a tablespoonful;
ground green ginger, half a teaspoonful; ground peppercorns, half a
teaspoonful; ground garlic, a quarter of a teaspoonful; garden
herbs, finely chopped, one dessertspoonful; salt, one
dessertspoonful; finely-grated bread-crumbs, three tablespoonfuls;
one egg.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;In the fish, crab, and prawn coftas the ginger must
be omitted.</p>

<p><b><a name="R33" id="R33"></a>33.&mdash;Beef Forcemeat Ball
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Get rather more than two pounds of good fat beef; wash it
thoroughly, and cut it into pieces, rejecting all veins and scraggy
portions; put about two pounds of it into a mortar and pound it
fine, removing all fibres, veins, &amp;c., and if it be desired put
up a broth of all the rejections. Mix with the pounded beef a
teaspoonful of salt, pepper, and garden herbs, and two
tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs; add a little of the broth, or in
its absence some milk; mix the whole well together; beat up the
yolk and white of the egg, add it to the mixture, and make into
balls about the size of large walnuts; roll them in bread-crumbs.
After heating the pot, melt the lard or ghee, and fry brown the
ground ingredients, sprinkling a tablespoonful of cold water over
them; then add the coftas or balls with salt to taste, and fry or
brown them; after which pour into the pot either a cup of broth or
of water, and allow to simmer for about two hours.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Some cooks add to the beef cofta curries ground hot
spices, which are fried with the curry condiments, and are suited
to most tastes.</p>

<p><b><a name="R34" id="R34"></a>34.&mdash;Chicken Forcemeat Ball
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Procure a good fat chicken and a quarter of a pound of beef
suet; put the suet into a mortar with all the fleshy parts of the
chicken, and pound to a pulp; make a stock of gravy of the bones;
mix with the pounded meat all the several ingredients named in the
foregoing recipe, with the addition of an egg well beaten up; make
into balls, roll in bread-crumbs, and curry as directed above.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The chicken cofta curry may also be made without any
suet; the general practice is to get chickens rather larger than
those usually selected for ordinary curries.</p>

<p><b><a name="R35" id="R35"></a>35.&mdash;Mutton Forcemeat Ball
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take the best parts of a leg or shoulder of mutton; cut them up,
wash, and pound well down; make a gravy of the bones and
rejections; mix with the pounded mutton all the ingredients
mentioned in the recipe for making beef balls, and cook exactly as
the beef cofta curry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R36" id="R36"></a>36.&mdash;Ball Curry of Liver and
Udder</b>
</p>

<p>Get one pound each of liver and udder; thoroughly wash and
parboil them, then cut them into pieces, put into a mortar, and
pound them to a pulp; mix with pepper, salt, herbs, bread-crumbs,
and an egg; make into balls, and curry them in the same manner as
any of the foregoing forcemeat ball curries.</p>

<p><b><a name="R37" id="R37"></a>37.&mdash;Prawn Cofta Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Get thirty to forty of the best prawns, and remove the heads and
shells; wash the prawns well with salt and water, then pound them
to a pulp; mix with it all the ingredients as directed for the beef
cofta; make into balls, roll them in bread-crumbs, and set aside.
After washing the heads, remove the shells, and bruise the contents
with a dessertspoonful of unroasted coriander-seed; take all the
juice, and fry it with the ground condiments; then put in the
balls, brown them, add salt to taste, a cup of water, and simmer
until they are cooked.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Good mustard oil is preferable to using lard or ghee,
and the ginger must be omitted; but the addition of a few
bay-leaves and blades of lemon-grass would be an improvement. It is
not usual to dish up the lemon-grass.</p>

<p><b><a name="R38" id="R38"></a>38.&mdash;Lobster Cofta Curry</b>
</p>

<p>According to their size, take eight or ten lobsters; clean them
thoroughly; remove the heads and shells; pull the flesh to pieces
and pound to a pulp; add to it some of the red coral from the head,
then mix into it the bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, herbs, and an egg
well beaten up, and make into balls. The remains of the heads and
the contents of the long legs bruise down with unroasted
coriander-seed; omitting the ginger, and cook the balls in the same
way as the prawn balls, with the addition of bay-leaves and a few
blades of lemon-grass. Lemon-grass is not served up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R39" id="R39"></a>39.&mdash;Crab Cofta Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Select ten or twelve <i>gheewalla kakakahs</i>, or crabs full of
the red coral, wash them thoroughly, then boil them; remove all the
meat and coral out of the shells, pound to a pulp, and, after
mixing all the ingredients and fixing them with an egg well beaten
up, make into balls, and cook them in all respects according to the
directions for lobster cofta curry. Time to simmer: say half an
hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R40" id="R40"></a>40.&mdash;Fish Cofta Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Cold boiled or fried fish is the best adapted for making coftas;
it is not necessary to give other instructions than those already
given at length in the foregoing recipes, excepting that mustard
oil is the best adapted for fresh fish curries.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The remains of hermetically-sealed fish, such as
salmon and mackerel, removed from dinner, are well adapted for
making cofta curries.</p>

<p>Under-done roast meats, such as beef, mutton, veal, and fowl,
will make excellent cofta curries.</p>

<h3><a name="H8" id="H8"></a>COUNTRY CAPTAIN</h3>

<p>The country captain is usually made of chicken, and occasionally
of kid and veal. Cold meats and curries are also sometimes
converted into this dish, the condiments for which are as
follow:&mdash;Two chittacks or four ounces of ghee, half a
teaspoonful of ground chilies, one teaspoonful of salt, a quarter
of a teaspoonful of ground turmeric, and twenty onions, cut up
lengthways into fine slices.</p>

<p><b><a name="R41" id="R41"></a>41.&mdash;Chicken Country
Captain</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up in the usual way an ordinary curry chicken. Warm the ghee
and fry the sliced onions, which when brown set aside; fry the
ground turmeric and chilies, then throw in the chicken and salt,
and continue to fry, stirring the whole, until the chicken is
tender. Serve it up, strewing over it the fried onions.</p>

<p><b><a name="R42" id="R42"></a>42.&mdash;Kid Country Captain</b>
</p>

<p>Before cutting up the kid, a fore-quarter, let it be partially
broiled or roasted, and then make it into country captain in
accordance with the above directions; or, instead of partially
roasting the kid, add half a cup of water to assist the meat to
dissolve.</p>

<p><b><a name="R43" id="R43"></a>43.&mdash;Veal Country Captain</b>
</p>

<p>Partially broil or roast a shoulder of veal before cutting it
up; or make the country captain as directed in recipe No. 42, by
adding half a cup of water instead of partially broiling the
meat.</p>

<p><b><a name="R44" id="R44"></a>44.&mdash;Jhal Frezee</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up into small squares, of less than an inch, either cold
mutton, beef, or veal, rejecting the bones; add a large quantity of
sliced onions, some chilies cut up, and a teaspoonful of salt. Warm
a chittack, or two ounces of ghee, and throw it into the meat,
onions, chilies, and salt, and allow to simmer, or fry, stirring
the whole while, until the onions are quite tender.</p>

<h3><a name="H9" id="H9"></a>HINDOOSTANEE CURRIES</h3>

<p><b><a name="R45" id="R45"></a>45.&mdash;Seik Kawab</b>
</p>

<p>Is usually eaten with chappatee or hand-bread, and only
occasionally with rice, and contains the following
condiments:&mdash;Two tablespoonfuls of mustard oil, four
teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground chilies,
half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground garlic, one teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one teaspoonful
and a half of salt, a cup of thick tyre or dhye, half a teaspoonful
of ground coriander-seed, the juice of one large lemon, and a
little ghee.</p>

<p>Take two pounds of beef, mutton, or veal; remove the bones, and
chop the meat slightly, without mincing or cutting through it; mix
well together all the ground condiments, including the oil, tyre,
and lemon-juice, in which steep the chopped meat, turning it over
occasionally to absorb the mixture. After a while cut up the meat
into squares of equal size, say two inches, and continue to keep
them in the mixture for fully one hour; then pass the squares of
meat either on a silver, plated, or other metal skewer, and roast
or broil over a slow charcoal fire, basting the whole time with
ghee, to allow the kawab to become of a rich brown colour, without
burning or being singed in the basting. Remove from the skewer, and
serve hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R46" id="R46"></a>46.&mdash;Tick-keeah Kawab</b>
</p>

<p>Take two pounds of fat beef, wash it, cut it into small pieces,
and pound it to a pulp, remove all fibres, &amp;c., and then add to
it one teaspoonful of ground onion, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground turmeric, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, a
quarter of a teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of
ground peppercorns, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground ginger,
half a teaspoonful of ground hot spices, and one tablespoonful of
tyre or dhye.</p>

<p>Mix the whole well together, add salt to your taste, and the
yolk and white of an egg well beaten up; form into balls of equal
sizes; flatten them, pass them on iron or plated skewers about
eighteen inches long, rub them well over with ghee, wrap them in
plantain-leaf, and roast or broil them over a charcoal fire. Serve
them up hot, removed from the skewers. These are usually eaten with
chappatee.</p>

<h3><a name="H10" id="H10"></a>HUSSANEE CURRIES, OR CURRIES ON
STICK</h3>

<p>The ingredients and condiments necessary for the curries on
stick are as follow:&mdash;One chittack and a half of ghee, one
teaspoonful and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions,
one teaspoonful of turmeric, half a teaspoonful of ginger, half a
cupful of water, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one
teaspoonful of chilies, half a cupful of tyre or dhye, some
finely-sliced ginger, and as many small curry onions cut into half
as may be required. Six silver pins five inches long, or, in the
absence of these, six bamboo pins, are required.</p>

<p><b><a name="R47" id="R47"></a>47.&mdash;Hussanee Beef Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up two pounds of beef into small squares not exceeding one
inch, and pass them on the silver or bamboo pins alternately with
half an onion and a slice of ginger. Half a dozen sticks with be
ample for four hearty consumers.</p>

<p>Warm the ghee and brown the ground condiments; then put in the
sticks of meat, and brown, stirring the whole; after this add the
tyre and a little water, and allow to simmer over a slow fire for
nearly two hours, when the curry will be ready. Serve up on a
curry-dish without removing the sticks.</p>

<p><b><a name="R48" id="R48"></a>48.&mdash;Hussanee Mutton
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Remove the meat from a shoulder of mutton, and cut it into small
squares; the same instructions will apply to the preparation of
mutton curry on stick as those given for beef curry on stick. Time
to simmer: half an hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R49" id="R49"></a>49.&mdash;Hussanee Veal Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Cut squares enough from a shoulder of veal, and observe the
instructions given in the foregoing recipe. Time to simmer: one
hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R50" id="R50"></a>50.&mdash;Hussanee Curry of Udder
and Liver</b>
</p>

<p>The udder and liver should be parboiled before being cut up for
passing on the sticks; but in all other respects the instructions
given for the beaf and mutton curries on stick will apply to the
udder and liver curry on stick. Time to simmer: fully one hour and
a half.</p>

<h3><a name="H11" id="H11"></a>KURMA OR QUOREMA CURRY</h3>

<p>This, without exception, is one of the richest of Hindoostanee
curries, but it is quite unsuited to European taste, if made,
according to the original recipe, of which the following is a
copy:&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="R51" id="R51"></a>51.&mdash;Quorema Curry, Plain</b>
</p>

<p>Take two pounds of mutton, one pound of tyre or dhye, two
chittacks of garlic, one dam of cardamoms, four chittacks of
bruised almonds, four mashas of saffron, the juice of five lemons,
one pound of ghee, four chittacks of sliced onions, one dam of
cloves, one chittack of pepper, four chittacks of cream, and a
quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic.</p>

<p>The following is the recipe of the quorema curry usually put on
a gentleman's table:&mdash;Two chittacks and a half or five ounces
of ghee, one cup or eight ounces of good thick tyre, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions,
one teaspoonful of coriander-seed, six small sticks of ground
cinnamon, two or three blades of lemon-grass, one teaspoonful and a
half of salt, a half teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a
teaspoonful of ground garlic, eight or ten peppercorns, four or
five ground cloves, five or six ground cardamoms, two or three
bay-leaves, a quarter of a cup of water, the juice of one lemon,
and twelve large onions cut lengthways into fine slices.</p>

<p>Take two pounds of good fat mutton, and cut it up into pieces
nearly one inch and a half square. Warm the ghee, fry in it the
sliced onions, and set aside; then fry all the ground condiments,
including the ground hot spices. When quite brown, throw in the
mutton and salt, and allow the whole to brown, after which add the
tyre, the hot spices with peppercorns and bay-leaves, the
lemon-grass, the water, and the fried onions finely chopped; close
the pot, and allow it to simmer over a gentle coal fire for about
an hour and a half or two hours, by which time the kurma will be
quite ready. The blades of lemon-grass are never dished up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R52" id="R52"></a>52.&mdash;Kid Quorema</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up a fore-quarter or a hind-quarter of a kid into eight or
ten pieces, and cook it exactly as directed in the foregoing
recipe. This is rather preferred to mutton quorema.</p>

<p><b><a name="R53" id="R53"></a>53.&mdash;Fowl Quorema</b>
</p>

<p>Take a young full-ground tender fowl; cut it up as for an
ordinary curry, cook it with all the condiments in the proportions
given, and observe all the directions laid down in recipe No.
51.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Most Europeans give the preference to the fowl
quorema.</p>

<h3><a name="H12" id="H12"></a>MALAY CURRIES</h3>

<p>The condiments and other ingredients necessary are as
follow:&mdash;One chittack or two ounces of ghee, one teaspoonful
and a half of salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one
teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies,
half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground garlic, the milk of a large cocoanut, say two cups, two
blades of lemon-grass, three or four cloves, ground, three or four
cardamoms, and as many small sticks of cinnamon, ground.</p>

<p>The coriander and cumin seeds must on no account be put into
malay curries, or the delicate flavour of the cocoanut will be
destroyed.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to provide what the natives call a
<i>narial-ka-khoornee</i>, which, interpreted, means "cocoanut
scraper." It is a small circular flat piece of iron, about the size
and thickness of a Spanish dollar, the edges being notched. It is
of rude construction, and fixed on a conveniently shaped wooden
frame, also of rude construction. The best of the kind may be
procured for two annas.</p>

<p><b><a name="R54" id="R54"></a>54.&mdash;Cocoanut Milk</b>
</p>

<p>The nut is scraped or rasped with the aid of the "khoornee" into
very fine particles; it is then put into a deep vessel, and boiling
water poured over it until the whole of the scraped cocoanut is
covered. After allowing it to steep for ten or fifteen minutes, it
is carefully strained through a clean napkin into another vessel or
cup, the pulp is returned into the original vessel, and more
boiling water is poured over it. This operation of steeping in
boiling water and straining is continued until you have obtained
the required quantity of the extracted milk of the cocoanut. The
pulp is thrown away. If the cocoanut be a small one, or its nut not
hard and deep, it will be necessary to provide a second cocoanut.
Good cocoanuts are sold at an anna to an anna and a half a
piece.</p>

<p><b><a name="R55" id="R55"></a>55.&mdash;Chicken Malay Gravy
Curry with White Pumpkin or Cucumber</b>
</p>

<p>Take the usual full-sized curry chicken, and divide it as before
directed; get either six cucumbers or a quarter of a white pumpkin;
remove the green skin and the part containing the seeds, then cut
it up into sixteen pieces of about two inches square, and steep in
water.</p>

<p>Fry in the ghee all the ground condiments, including the ground
hot spices; when brown, add the cut-up chicken and salt; fry to a
fine bright light brown; then put in the pumpkin, having previously
allowed all the water to drain away through a colander; pour in the
two cups of cocoanut milk, the lemon-grass, and hot spices, and
allow the whole to simmer over a slow fire for about half an hour,
when the curry will be ready: the blade of lemon-grass is not
dished up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R56" id="R56"></a>56.&mdash;Prawn Malay Gravy Curry
with White Pumpkin or Cucumber</b>
</p>

<p>Select the bagda prawns (<i>bagda chingree</i>), whenever they
are procurable, in preference to any other description. The shell
and head are of a dark colour in comparison with what are called
<i>jeel ka chingree</i>, the shell and head of which are very
perceptibly several shades lighter than the <i>bagdas</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to quote any price as a guide, the fluctuation
being almost incredible. Fine large prawns, not
lobsters&mdash;prawns which, without their heads, would be about
the size of the ordinary dried Normandy pippins sent out to this
country for tarts&mdash;may be obtained one day at two annas for
twenty, and the next day they will not be procurable at less than
eight annas for the same number. This remark applies generally to
fish of every description brought for sale into the Calcutta
market.</p>

<p>With one other remark of importance, we shall proceed to the
instructions necessary for the preparation of prawn malay gravy
curry.</p>

<p>The prawns should be parboiled after removing the heads, to rid
them, as the natives call it, of <i>besine</i>, which means all
disagreeable character of fishy smell and taste.</p>

<p>As a rule, the heads of prawns should always be rejected, which,
in the process of frying, absorb largely the ghee, and in the
cooking dispel a liquid from their spongy formation.</p>

<p>In all other respects, the prawn malay gravy curry is cooked
like the chicken malay gravy curry, omitting the ginger; but an
additional blade or two of the lemon-grass would not be amiss,
which, on the curry being dished, are thrown away.</p>

<p><b><a name="R57" id="R57"></a>57.&mdash;Chicken Malay Gravy
Curry with Pulwal</b>
</p>

<p>Take a fat chicken, clean it, remove all the flesh and pound it
to a pulp, and prepare it in every respect as directed in recipe
No. 34 for a cofta curry, omitting the suet. Take a dozen
large-sized pulwals, scrape or pare away the outer skin, split them
down one side, extract all the seeds, &amp;c., and throw the
pulwals into cold water; wash and drain away all the water, then
stuff them with the prepared forcemeat, tie them with fine sewing
cotton, and cook them in the milk of the cocoanut, exactly as
directed in recipe No. 55.</p>

<p><b><a name="R58" id="R58"></a>58.&mdash;Prawn Malay Gravy Curry
with Pulwal</b>
</p>

<p>Take bagda prawns; shell and clean them, pound to a pulp, and
prepare as directed in recipe No. 37 for prawn cofta curry. Take a
dozen pulwals, peel them finely, cut them open lengthways, clear
them of all seeds, &amp;c., wash and dry them, then stuff them with
the prepared prawn mince; tie the pulwals with sewing cotton, and
cook in cocoanut milk as directed in recipe No. 56.</p>

<p><b><a name="R59" id="R59"></a>59.&mdash;Chicken Malay
Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>The condiments and ingredients are as follow:&mdash;One chittack
and a half or three ounces of ghee, one teaspoonful and a half of
salt, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of
ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one cup
of strong cocoanut milk, and one dozen onions cut lengthways into
fine slices.</p>

<p>Cut up the chicken in the usual manner, warm the ghee, fry and
set aside the sliced onions, then fry brown the ground condiments,
after which add the chicken and salt. When fried brown, pour in the
cocoanut milk and the fried onions finely chopped, and allow to
simmer over a slow fire: the Malay doopiaja will be ready in an
hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R60" id="R60"></a>60.&mdash;Prawn Malay Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take sixteen or twenty large bagda prawns, throw away the heads,
parboil the prawns, and then doopiaje in all respects as for a
chicken Malay doopiaja, omitting the ginger.</p>

<h3><a name="H13" id="H13"></a>PORTUGUESE CURRY (VINDALOO OR
BINDALOO)</h3>

<p>This well-known Portuguese curry can only be made properly of
beef, pork, or duck. The following is a recipe of the vindaloo in
general use:&mdash;</p>

<p>Six ounces or three chittacks of ghee or lard, one tablespoonful
of bruised garlic, one tablespoonful of ground garlic, one
tablespoonful of ground ginger, two teaspoonfuls of ground chilies,
one teaspoonful of roasted and ground coriander-seed, half a
teaspoonful of roasted and ground cumin-seed, two or three
bay-leaves, a few peppercorns, four or five cloves, roasted and
ground, four or five cardamoms, roasted and ground, six small
sticks of cinnamon, roasted and ground, with half a cup of good
vinegar, to two pounds of pork or beef or a duck.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The best vindaloo is that prepared with mustard
oil.</p>

<p><b><a name="R61" id="R61"></a>61.&mdash;Beef Vindaloo</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up two pounds of fat beef into large squares, and steep them
in the vinegar, together with half a teaspoonful of salt and all
the ground condiments, from eighteen to twenty-four hours. Then
warm the ghee or lard and throw in the meat, together with the
condiments and vinegar in which it had been steeped, adding a few
peppercorns and bay-leaves, and allow to simmer gently over a slow
fire for two hours, or until the meat is perfectly tender, and
serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R62" id="R62"></a>62.&mdash;Pork Vindaloo</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up two pounds of fat pork into large squares, and curry
according to the directions given in the foregoing recipe, omitting
the cloves, cardamoms, and cinnamon.</p>

<p><b><a name="R63" id="R63"></a>63.&mdash;Duck Vindaloo</b>
</p>

<p>Take a young, full-grown, but tender duck; cut it up as for a
curry, and put it through the same course of pickling from eighteen
to twenty-four hours before being cooked.</p>

<p><b><a name="R64" id="R64"></a>64.&mdash;Pickled Vindaloo</b>
(adapted as a Present to Friends at a Distance)</p>

<p>If the following instructions be carried out carefully, the
vindaloo will keep good for months, and, if required, may be sent
as an acceptable present to friends at home.</p>

<p>In order to keep it good sufficiently long to be sent home round
the Cape, select the fattest parts of pork; satisfy yourself that
the meat is fresh and sound, and that it has not been washed with
water in the butcher's shop. Cut the meat into two-inch squares,
wash thoroughly in vinegar (no water), rub over with the following
condiments, and then steep them in really good English vinegar for
twenty-four hours:&mdash;Garlic bruised, not ground down, dry
ginger powdered, turmeric powdered, peppercorns roasted and
powdered, coriander-seeds roasted and powdered, cumin-seeds roasted
and powdered, and dry salt.</p>

<p>Melt a large quantity of the best mustard oil in an earthen pot,
and, according to the quantity of meat, take additional condiments
mentioned above, but in the proportion given in recipe No. 61;
grind in vinegar, and fry in the oil; then put in the meat, and all
the vinegar, &amp;c., in which it had been stepped, together with
some more salt, a little more vinegar, a few bay-leaves and
peppercorns, and allow to simmer until the meat is quite tender.
Remove from the fire and allow it to get quite cold; then put it
into dry stone jars, with patent screw tops, well filled with
plenty of the oil in which the vindaloo was cooked. Take care that
all the meat is well covered over with oil, which latter ought to
be at least from two to three inches above the meat in the jar.
Screw down the lid, and cover it over with a good sound bladder to
render it perfectly air-tight.</p>

<p>When required for use, take out only as much as will suffice,
and simply warm it in a little of its own gravy.</p>

<p><b><a name="R65" id="R65"></a>65.&mdash;Curry Paste</b>
</p>

<p>Is likewise adapted for sending as a present to friends at home.
It is made in the following manner:&mdash;Eight ounces of dhunnia,
or coriander-seed, roasted; one ounce of jeerah, or cumin-seed,
roasted; two ounces of huldee, or dry turmeric; two ounces of lal
mirritch, dry chilies; two ounces of kala mirritch, black pepper,
roasted; two ounces of rai, or mustard-seed; one ounce of soat, or
dry ginger; one ounce of lussan, or garlic; four ounces of nimmuck,
salt; four ounces of cheenee, or sugar; four ounces of chunna or
gram dal without husk, and roasted. The above ingredients, in the
proportions given, to be carefully pounded and ground down with the
best English white wine vinegar to the consistency of a thick
jelly; then warm some good sweet oil, and while bubbling fry in it
the mixture until it is reduced to a paste; let it cool, and then
bottle it.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Great care must be taken not to use any water in the
preparation, and mustard oil is better adapted than sweet oil for
frying the mixture in.</p>

<h3><a name="H14" id="H14"></a>MADRAS MULLIGATAWNY CURRY</h3>

<p>As this dish is usually served up and partaken of in the place
of ordinary soup, reference will be made to it hereafter under the
head of "Soups."</p>

<p>Before proceeding to remark on fish, vegetable, and peas
curries, a few useful hints and suggestions may be offered on meat
curries generally.</p>

<p>In many families the remains of cold meat, if not required for
other purposes, are made into curry: cold roast or boiled mutton is
admirably adapted for the purpose; and in ninety-nine cases out of
a hundred consumers cannot tell the difference. If there be any
difference or advantage, it is decidedly in favour of the cold
meat: the roasting joints are always of a superior quality to meats
sold under the designation of "curry meats."</p>

<p>The remains of cold roast beef make the best cofta curries,
croquets, &amp;c., and if the beef be under-done no fresh beef will
make a better doopiaja.</p>

<p>Vegetables are sometimes put into gravy meat curries, never into
doopiajas; but, as a rule, the introduction of vegetable into any
meat curry is objectionable, from the fact that all vegetables in
the process of boiling or cooking throw out a liquid, some more and
some less: the potato throws out the least, but of a disagreeable
character. It is true potatoes may be boiled before being put into
a curry, but the piquancy and peculiarity of flavour looked for in
a curry is so palpably destroyed that the innovation may be
discovered with closed eyes. The introduction of vegetable into
gravy fish curries, however, is no innovation, as the condiments
used for the one answer for the other; both are cooked in oil, and
the ginger omitted.</p>

<p><b><a name="R66" id="R66"></a>66.&mdash;Gravy Fish Curries</b>
</p>

<p>The condiments are as follows:&mdash;Mustard oil, one chittack
or two ounces; water, two cups; four teaspoonfuls of ground onions,
one teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground
chilies, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of garlic.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that mustard oil is used instead of ghee, and
no ginger.</p>

<p>Too much care cannot be observed in thoroughly cleaning,
rubbing, and washing the fish in salt and water before cooking it
for the table. Fish, if properly washed, when served up will never
be offensive, unless it be bad when purchased.</p>

<p><b><a name="R67" id="R67"></a>67.&mdash;Hilsa Fish Gravy
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>The head and tail are thrown away, and the fish cut into slices
of rather more than half an inch thick; these should be washed in
several waters with salt, to rid them of all "besine," before they
are curried.</p>

<p>The acid of tamarind is considered an improvement, or "amchoor,"
which is sliced green mangoe dried in salt.</p>

<p><b><a name="R68" id="R68"></a>68.&mdash;Beckty Fish Gravy
Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Is sliced and washed in salt like the hilsa before being cooked.
It is not usual to put any acid in the beckty fish curry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R69" id="R69"></a>69.&mdash;Prawn Doopiaja</b>
</p>

<p>Take one chittack and a half of mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls
of ground onions, one teaspoonful of ground turmeric, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, a quarter of a teaspoonful of
garlic, twelve curry onions cut lengthways, each into six or eight
slices, one cupful of water, and twelve large prawns.</p>

<p>Clean and thoroughly wash the prawns, rejecting the heads, or
taking only their substance pounded and squeezed out with unroasted
coriander-seed, and after parboiling the prawns make the doopiaja
in all respects according to the ordinary mode.</p>

<p><b><a name="R70" id="R70"></a>70.&mdash;Sliced Hilsa Fish Fried
in Curry Condiments</b>
</p>

<p>Take two teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful of
ground chilies, two teaspoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of
ground turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, and
one chittack of mustard oil.</p>

<p>After slicing a hilsa in the manner directed for a curry, and
having thoroughly cleaned and washed it with salt, rub into the
slices all the ground condiments and the remaining salt, and allow
them to remain for at least an hour. Warm the oil, and fry the
slices of fish of a very light and bright brown. Serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R71" id="R71"></a>71.&mdash;Sliced Beckty Fish Fried
in Curry Condiments</b>
</p>

<p>Slice, wash, and fry exactly as directed above. Fish served up
in this manner is well suited to some European tastes, and makes an
agreeable change to the ordinary mode of frying fish for
breakfast.</p>

<p><b><a name="R72" id="R72"></a>72.&mdash;Egg Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take six or eight eggs, boil hard, shell, cut into halves, and
set them aside; take ghee, ground condiments, and sliced fried
onions, in all respects the same as for a chicken doopiaja, and
observe precisely the same method of cooking, keeping in mind the
fact that, the eggs being already cooked or boiled, a smaller
quantity of water and a shorter time to simmer will suffice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R73" id="R73"></a>73.&mdash;Egg Curry with Green
Peas</b>
</p>

<p>This is a favourite curry with some families in winter, when the
English green peas are procurable. The method of preparing it is
exactly the same as recipe No. 71, allowing the curry to simmer
until the peas are quite tender.</p>

<p><b><a name="R74" id="R74"></a>74.&mdash;Egg Curry, with Chunna
Ka Dal</b>
</p>

<p>Parboil and dal, say half a cupful; curry the dal first; when
about nearly cooked, throw in the hard-boiled eggs, and finish the
simmering immediately the dal is soft or tender.</p>

<h3><a name="H15" id="H15"></a>CHAHKEES</h3>

<p>Chahkee is a term applied to vegetable curries, some of which
are deservedly popular, and one in particular, which many families
have daily during the season the vegetables are procurable, and yet
never tire of, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><b><a name="R75" id="R75"></a>75.&mdash;Seam, Potato, and Peas
Chahkee</b>
</p>

<p>Take twenty seams, four new potatoes, and a quarter of a seer of
green peas; divide each seam into three pieces, and throw into a
bowl of water; divide each potato into four pieces, and throw into
water; shell the peas, wash all thoroughly, put into a colander to
drain, and cook with the following condiments:&mdash;One chittack
and a half of mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one
teaspoonful and a half of salt, and one cupful of water. Warm the
oil, let it bubble well, and fry the ground condiments; when these
are quite brown put in the vegetables and salt; let the whole fry,
stirring it well; then add the water, and allow it to simmer over a
slow fire until the vegetables are quite tender.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;A cauliflower may be added if required for a
change.</p>

<p><b><a name="R76" id="R76"></a>76.&mdash;Pulwal, Potatoes, and
Torrie</b>
</p>

<p>Clean as much of the above three kinds of vegetables as will
overfill a vegetable-dish, and make the chahkee in all respects as
the foregoing.</p>

<p><b><a name="R77" id="R77"></a>77.&mdash;Red Pumpkin and
Tamarind</b>
</p>

<p>A quarter of a red pumpkin and the pulp of two or three
tamarinds will be enough. Dissolve the pulp of the tamarind in the
water, and put it into the curry after the pumpkin has been
fried.</p>

<p><b><a name="R78" id="R78"></a>78.&mdash;White Pumpkin and
Tamarind</b>
</p>

<p>Chahkee it in the same way as the red pumpkin.</p>

<p><b><a name="R79" id="R79"></a>79.&mdash;White Pumpkin, Plain,
Cut Small</b>
</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give any further instructions than those
already given.</p>

<p><b><a name="R80" id="R80"></a>80.&mdash;Tomato with Tamarind</b>
</p>

<p>Take twenty tomatoes and the pulp of two or three tamarinds, and
chahkee as directed for red pumpkin.</p>

<p><b><a name="R81" id="R81"></a>81.&mdash;Tomato, Plain</b>
</p>

<p>Chahkee twenty tomatoes according to instructions given for
other chahkees.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;There is a fresh green herb called soa mattee, which
is sometimes put into fish, vegetable, and other curries. Some
Europeans like the flavour, and have it daily when procurable.
Inquiry and trial are recommended.</p>

<h3><a name="H16" id="H16"></a>SAUG CURRIES</h3>

<p>Half an anna's worth of any saug will suffice for a party of
four, for curries made of greens, such as spinach, &amp;c. The
following condiments, &amp;c., are used:&mdash;One chittack and a
half of mustard oil, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, one
teaspoonful and a half of ground salt, and one cupful of water.</p>

<p><b><a name="R82" id="R82"></a>82.&mdash;Red Saug and Omra</b>
</p>

<p>The omra should be peeled, and half fried if large. Great care
must be taken to thoroughly clean and wash the greens. Put them
into a colander and allow all the water to drain away. Then warm
the oil, and fry the ground condiments; then the saug and omra, and
when crisp add the water and cook over a slow fire until the greens
and omra are tender.</p>

<p><b><a name="R83" id="R83"></a>83.&mdash;Red Saug, Omra, and
Shrimps</b>
</p>

<p>Observe in all respects the same process as that required in
cooking without the shrimps, omitting the ginger.</p>

<p><b><a name="R84" id="R84"></a>84.&mdash;Red Saug and Prawns</b>
</p>

<p>The prawns should be parboiled, and then follow all the
instructions in recipe No. 82.</p>

<p><b><a name="R85" id="R85"></a>85.&mdash;Green Saug with
Prawns</b>
</p>

<p>Proceed in every particular as with the last.</p>

<p><b><a name="R86" id="R86"></a>86.&mdash;Danta Curry with
Shrimps</b>
</p>

<p>The danta is a fine delicate long green pod which the
horseradish-tree yields, and contains small peas; these pods are
cut into lengths of three or four inches and cooked with shrimps.
Beyond this explanation it is not necessary to enlarge upon the
instructions already given.</p>

<p><b><a name="R87" id="R87"></a>87.&mdash;Khuttah Carree, or Acid
Vegetable Curry</b>
</p>

<p>Take small quantities of all kinds of vegetables in season, but
the best curry is that made of potatoes, kutchoo or artichoke,
sweet potatoes or suckercund, carrots, red and white pumpkins, and
tomatoes.</p>

<p>The vegetables should be cut into large pieces, and boiled in
water with the following condiments:&mdash;Four teaspoonfuls of
ground onions, one teaspoonful each of ground turmeric and chilies,
a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground garlic, and one teaspoonful of
roasted and ground coriander-seed.</p>

<p>Prepare two large cups of tamarind water, slightly sweetened
with jaggry, strain through a sieve, and add the strained water to
the boiled vegetables with a few fresh chilies. Then melt in a
separate pot one chittack or two ounces of mustard oil. While the
oil is bubbling, fry in it a teaspoonful of the collinga, or
onion-seeds, and when sufficiently fried pour it over the boiled
vegetables including the tamarind water. Close up the pot, and
allow it to simmer for fifteen to twenty minutes, when it will be
ready. It is eaten cold.</p>

<h3><a name="H17" id="H17"></a>BHAHJEES</h3>

<p>By <i>bhahjee</i> is meant fried. The two most generally
approved vegetable bhahjees are those made of bringals and pulwals.
The following are the condiments, &amp;c., used:&mdash;Mustard oil
according to the quantity of vegetable to be fried, a little ground
turmeric and chilies, and some salt.</p>

<p><b><a name="R88" id="R88"></a>88.&mdash;Bringal Bhahjee</b>
</p>

<p>Take young full-sized bringals; wash them thoroughly, and slice
them about an eighth of an inch thick; dry them, steep them for
half an hour in the ground condiments and salt, fry in oil, and
serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R89" id="R89"></a>89.&mdash;Pulwal Bhahjee</b>
</p>

<p>Take a dozen or more pulwals&mdash;a most excellent and
wholesome native vegetable,&mdash;scrape or pare away very finely
the upper green coating, divide them lengthways into two pieces,
clear away all the seeds, &amp;c., wash, drain away all the water,
and steep them in ground turmeric, chilies, and salt for half an
hour or longer; then fry them quite crisp in melted mustard oil.
They are much liked by some Europeans.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The vegetable called ram's horns or lady's fingers,
known by the natives as <i>dharus</i>, makes an excellent bhahjee;
so does the <i>kerrella</i>, a small green and intensely bitter
native vegetable, which comes into the market in March and April;
it is not, however, well suited to the European taste.</p>

<h3><a name="H18" id="H18"></a>DAL OR PEAS CURRIES</h3>

<p>Half an anna's worth of any dal will suffice for a party of
four. The condiments are as follow:&mdash;Three-quarters of a
chittack of ghee, four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one
teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground
turmeric, half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a
teaspoonful of ground garlic, one teaspoonful and a half of salt,
and half a dozen onions cut into six or eight slices each.</p>

<p><b><a name="R90" id="R90"></a>90.&mdash;Moong Dal</b>
</p>

<p>Take half a pound of the raw dal, or say half a cupful; clean,
pick, and roast it; mix it up with all the ground condiments and
salt, put into a pot, pour water over the whole, some two inches
above the dal, and boil it well, until the dal has quite dissolved.
Be careful not to disturb it while in the process of boiling, but
allow it to cake as it were <i>en masse</i>. When thoroughly
boiled, churn the dal by twirling it in a wooden instrument called
a <i>ghootnee</i>; then warm the ghee in a separate pot, fry the
onions, chop them, and throw into the churned dal, after which pour
the dal into the pot of melted ghee, and keep stirring until the
dal and ghee have well mixed; then put the cover on, and allow to
simmer over a slow fire for about a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The standard price of the best roasted moong dal is
two annas and a half per seer.</p>

<p><b><a name="R91" id="R91"></a>91.&mdash;Mussoor or Red Dal</b>
</p>

<p>The process in all respects for preparing and cooking the red
dal is the same as for the moong dal, excepting that, instead of
fried sliced onions, a large clove of garlic is cut up small,
fried, and takes the place of the onions.</p>

<p>The price of the best quality mussoor dal, free of husk, is two
annas per seer.</p>

<p><b><a name="R92" id="R92"></a>92.&mdash;Mussoor Dal with Amchoor
or with Tamarind</b>
</p>

<p>Put the amchoor, or, if preferred, tamarind, into the pot with
the dal; allow it to dissolve, and when the dal is going through
the process of bring churned remove the hard stones of the amchoor
or seeds of the tamarind.</p>

<p><b><a name="R93" id="R93"></a>93.&mdash;Mussoor Dal Chur
Churree</b>
</p>

<p>Instead of only half a dozen onions, take a dozen, and cut them
into fine slices lengthways. Warm the three-quarters of a chittack
of ghee, fry and set aside the sliced onions, then fry all the
ground condiments; next put in and fry the dal, having previously
washed it well, soaked it in water for about a quarter of an hour,
and drained it through a colander. When thoroughly fried and
browned, add only a little water, barely sufficient to cover the
fried dal, and allow to simmer from ten to fifteen minutes, or
until the dal has dissolved. Serve up, strewing over it the fried
onions. If chunna ka dal be used, soak it for an hour.</p>

<p>Other dals are occasionally served up, but very rarely at
European tables. The price of the best clean chunna ka dal rarely
exceeds two annas per seer.</p>

<p><b><a name="R94" id="R94"></a>94.&mdash;Dal Foolaree</b>
</p>

<p>Is much liked by Europeans, but is rarely served up well, owing
to the trouble and time required in making it properly.</p>

<h3><a name="H19" id="H19"></a>BURTAS OR MASHES</h3>

<p>Burtas are mashes of potatoes and other vegetables, cold meats,
dry fish, &amp;c.; they are palatable, and much liked by most
Europeans as accompaniments to curry and rice. The ingredients to
almost every burta are the fine large white Patna onions, fresh
green chilies, and the juice of fresh lemons.</p>

<p><b><a name="R95" id="R95"></a>95.&mdash;Potato Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Take a moderate or middling sized white Panta onion; remove the
outer coats, and slice very fine; then slice or cut up two hot
green chilies, and squeeze over the onion and chilies the juice of
a fresh lime: allow to soak. Take eight or ten well-boiled
potatoes, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of good
mustard oil; bruise the potatoes down with a large silver or plated
fork, adding, when they are half bruised, the onions and chilies,
with as much only of the lime-juice as may be agreeable: mix all
well together with a light hand, so that the potatoes may not cake,
and yet be well and thoroughly mashed and mixed.</p>

<p><b><a name="R96" id="R96"></a>96.&mdash;Brinjal Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare the sliced onions, chilies, and lime-juice in the manner
directed for potato burta. Take two fine young brinjals of large
size; carefully and thoroughly roast them in a quick ash fire;
remove the ashes and burnt parts of the skin, if any; then open the
brinjals, and with a clean spoon remove the contents to as near the
skin as possible, to which add a good teaspoonful of salt and
teaspoonful of mustard oil; work these with a spoon to a perfect
pulp, throwing away the lumps or shreds if any; then mix with it
all the onions, chilies, and lime-juice. If not to your taste, add
more salt or lime-juice, according to fancy.</p>

<p><b><a name="R97" id="R97"></a>97.&mdash;Dry Fish Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare onions, chilies, and lime-juice as before. Take a part
of the Arabian dried beckty and well broil it; remove all the
bones, and pound the fish to nearly a powder; mix it thoroughly
with a teaspoonful of mustard oil, and add the onions, chilies, and
lime-juice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R98" id="R98"></a>98.&mdash;Red Herring Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Take onions, chilies, and lime-juice. Place the herring, with
its original paper packing, on a gridiron, or on a frying-pan, and
warm it well; then clear it of all skin, very carefully pick out
<i>all</i> the bones, bruise the herring, and mix it thoroughly
with the sliced onions, chilies, and lime-juice.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This is an inimitable burta.</p>

<p><b><a name="R99" id="R99"></a>99.&mdash;Cold Corned-Beef
Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Steep sliced onions and chilies in lime-juice; have the red
well-corned part of a cold round of beef nicely pounded; add to it
the onions, chilies, and as much of the lime-juice as may be
desirable.</p>

<p><b><a name="R100" id="R100"></a>100.&mdash;Cold Tongue Burta</b>
</p>

<p>The remains of a well-corned cold tongue make an excellent
burta, as per recipe for cold beef burta.</p>

<p><b><a name="R101" id="R101"></a>101.&mdash;Cold Ham Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Is made in the same way as the beef and tongue burtas.</p>

<p><b><a name="R102" id="R102"></a>102.&mdash;Green Mango Burta</b>
</p>

<p>The condiments for this burta are a quarter of a teaspoonful of
ground chilies, half a teaspoonful of ground fresh mint-leaves,
half a teaspoonful of ground ginger, half a teaspoonful of salt,
and a teaspoonful of sugar.</p>

<p>Take two ordinary large-size green mangoes; peel, divide, and
throw them into clean water, remove the stones, then bruise them to
a perfect pulp with the aid of the curry-stone and muller. Care
must be taken that the stone is perfectly clean, and will not
impart the flavour of garlic or turmeric to the burta. Mix the
sugar well with the pulp; if the mango be very acid, add a little
more sugar; then mix it with the salt and ground condiments; more
salt or sugar may be added if required.</p>

<p><b><a name="R103" id="R103"></a>103.&mdash;Tomato Burta</b>
</p>

<p>Bake in an oven a dozen good-sized tomatoes until the skin
cracks; break them down, and mix with them a little ground chilies,
ginger, salt, and half a teaspoonful of good mustard oil. A small
squeeze of lemon-juice may be added if desired.</p>

<h3><a name="H20" id="H20"></a>SOUPS</h3>

<p>A digester is best adapted for boiling soups in, as no steam can
escape, and consequently less water is required than in a common
pot.</p>

<p>To extract the substance or essence of meat, long and slow
boiling over a charcoal fire is absolutely necessary. In the first
instance, however, it is desirable to boil up the meat with pepper
and salt on a quick, brisk fire, and take away all the black scum
which rises to the surface; then pour a little cold water into the
pot to raise up the white scum, which also remove, and reduce the
fire, taking care that in the process of slow-boiling the pot is
never off the boil.</p>

<p><b><a name="R104" id="R104"></a>104.&mdash;Shin of Beef Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Take a shin of beef, cut it up small, wash it thoroughly, and
boil with pepper and salt in sufficient water to well cover the
meat. Let it boil over a brisk fire, taking away the black scum;
add a little cold water, and skim off the white scum; then reduce
the fire, and allow the soup to simmer until it somewhat thickens;
strain the soup, cut away all the fat, season with soup herbs, and
add more pepper and salt if necessary. Give it a good boil up, and
then clear it with the white of an egg well beaten up, after which
add a tablespoonful of Lea &amp; Perrin's Worcestershire sauce, and
half a wineglassful of sherry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R105" id="R105"></a>105.&mdash;Shin of Beef Soup,
with Forcemeat and Egg Balls</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a shin of beef soup in all respects according to the
above directions; clear with an egg well beaten up, add to it
sauce, sherry, forcemeat, and egg balls.</p>

<p><b><a name="R106" id="R106"></a>106.&mdash;Vermicelli Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a shin of beef soup as directed above, omitting the
sauce and sherry. Parboil some vermicelli, and after clearing the
soup with the white of an egg, add to it the parboiled vermicelli,
and give it all a good boil up before serving.</p>

<p><b><a name="R107" id="R107"></a>107.&mdash;Macaroni Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a shin of beef soup as directed above, omitting the
sauce and wine; boil some macaroni until perfectly tender; clear
the soup with the white of an egg, then add the boiled macaroni,
and warm up before serving.</p>

<p><b><a name="R108" id="R108"></a>108.&mdash;Mulligatawny Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a shin of beef soup as above, omitting the sauce, wine,
and white of egg; set the soup aside. Take a full-sized curry
chicken; cut it up into sixteen or eighteen pieces, and wash them
thoroughly. Warm a pot and melt it into two chittacks or four
ounces of ghee; fry in it some finely-sliced onions, and set aside.
Then fry in the melted ghee the following condiments,
&amp;c.:&mdash;Four teaspoonfuls of ground onions, one teaspoonful
of ground turmeric, one teaspoonful of ground chilies, half a
teaspoonful of ground ginger, a quarter of a teaspoonful of ground
garlic, half a teaspoonful of roasted and ground coriander-seed,
and a quarter of a teaspoonful of roasted and ground
cumin-seed.</p>

<p>Sprinkle a little water over these while frying; then add the
cut-up chicken with two teaspoonfuls of salt. When nearly brown,
add one chittack or two ounces of roasted and ground poppy-seeds;
pour in the beef soup, add the fried onion and half a dozen of the
<i>kurreah fool</i> leaves, close the pot, and allow the whole to
simmer over a slow fire until the chicken be perfectly tender.
Serve up hot, with limes cut in slices on a separate plate.</p>

<p><b><a name="R109" id="R109"></a>109.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a shin of beef as directed above. Cut up a chicken; wash
it and set it aside. Heat a pot and melt in it two chittacks or
four ounces of ghee. After frying in it and setting aside some
finely-sliced onions, fry the condiments in the proportions given
in the foregoing recipe; then add the cut-up chicken with two
teaspoonfuls of salt; brown it nicely; have ready two chittacks or
four ounces of roasted and ground chunna ka or gram dal, which mix
thoroughly in a cup of strong cocoanut milk, and pour over the
chicken just as it has become brown; stir it well, and add the
fried onions and the soup, with half a dozen of the <i>kurreah
fool</i> leaves; close the pot, and allow the whole to simmer for
three-quarters of an hour. Serve up hot, with limes, either whole
or cut in slices, on a separate plate.</p>

<p><b><a name="R110" id="R110"></a>110.&mdash;Delicious Curry
Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a strong beef soup; slice some onions, and cut up a
chicken; take curry condiments as directed above, omitting the
coriander and cumin seed; melt two chittacks or four ounces of
ghee; fry and set aside the sliced onions, then fry the condiments,
add the cut-up chicken, and fry that also. In a part of the beef
soup boil a spoonful of tamarind, so as to separate the stocks and
stones; strain and stir it into the fried chicken. After a while
add the remainder of the beef soup, with half a dozen <i>kurreah
fool</i> leaves, and the friend onions; close up the pot, and
continue to simmer the whole until the chicken is quite tender.
Serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R111" id="R111"></a>111.&mdash;Bright Onion Soup</b>
</p>

<p>Take a shoulder of veal; cut it up small, breaking all the
bones; wash it thoroughly, put it into a pan with pepper, salt, and
water, boil it well, and remove all the scum as it rises; reduce
the fire, and let it simmer until the meat is perfectly dissolved;
strain it, cut away all the fat, add soup herbs, and more pepper
and salt if required; give it a boil up, and clear it with the
white of an egg well beaten up; slice very fine some pure silvery
white Patna onions, and steep them in boiling water, changing the
water three or four times, every ten minutes; drain away all the
water and add the onions to the soup; boil, and serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R112" id="R112"></a>112.&mdash;Bridal Soup, or Soup
Elegant</b>
</p>

<p>Take two large shoulders of veal; cut them up small, bones and
all, and, after washing thoroughly, boil over a brisk fire, with
<i>white</i> pepper and the best white salt. Be careful that the
scum that rises is well skimmed; reduce the fire, and allow it to
simmer until the meat falls off the bones; strain the soup, let it
cool, and then thoroughly free it of all fat; return it into a
clean digester, add more salt and white pepper if necessary, and
some <i>white</i> stocks of celery; boil it, and clear it with the
whites of two eggs well beaten up; strain through flannel and set
aside.</p>

<p>Take the best and most transparent parts of a calf's head and
the tongue, and boil perfectly tender without reducing them to
shreds, being careful to remove all the scum that rises to the
surface; lay the boiled tongue and meat out on a clean dish; slice
the tongue fine, and cut out all manner of devices, such as,
diamonds, squares, circles, hearts, stars, &amp;c.; do the same
with the best and cleanest parts of meat selected from the head;
take care that no particles of scum or other impurities be adhering
to them; where any does adhere, rinse it off in a little of the
cleared soup; then place them carefully into the tureen in which it
is purposed to serve up the soup. If fancy macaroni be procurable,
a tablespoonful may be boiled tender, free of all particles of dust
or powder, and added to the cut-up meat and tongue, over which pour
the boiling-hot soup; add to it a wineglassful of the palest
sherry, and serve up hot.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The calf's tongue and meat of the head may be boiled
with the veal, but they should be removed when tender, and not
allowed to dissolve with the longer simmering of the veal.</p>

<p>This is an elegant soup, beautifully transparent, and of the
colour of light champagne.</p>

<p><b><a name="R113" id="R113"></a>113.&mdash;Soup Royal</b>

<p>Take a shin of beef, the best parts of meat cut off from a
calf's head, and the tongue; cut the beef into small particles, but
leave the tongue and the meat from the calf's head whole; add
pepper and salt, and boil well, clearing the scum as it rises;
remove the tongue and the meat of the calf's head when sufficiently
tender, but continue to boil the shin of beef until it is well
dissolved; then strain it, and cut away all the fat; put it up
again with plenty of soup herbs, and more salt and pepper if
necessary; boil it well up; squeeze into the soup the juice of half
a lemon, and skim it well; strain it once more, and set it
aside.</p>

<p>Cut the tongue into slices of an eighth of an inch thick, trim
them into the shape of large diamonds, and set aside. Cut up the
meat of the calf's head into one-inch squares and strips of an inch
and a half long and half an inch wide; add to these a few
ready-fried circular flat brain cakes, make also a few egg balls
and forcemeat balls, and, after cooking, add them to the rest of
the meat, tongue, &amp;c., and set aside.</p>

<p>Take four red carrots, one pound of green peas, half a pound of
boiled potatoes, one large turnip, one large Patna onion, a quarter
of a pound of roasted and ground split peas or gram dal, some soup
herbs, pepper, and salt, the pulp of one orange, and the peels of
half an orange and half a lemon. Put these into a stewpan with
water sufficient to cover the whole; boil them thoroughly, skimming
all the while; when perfectly dissolved, turn them out into a
colander and allow all the water to drain away; then turn the
contents of the colander into a sieve, and pass the vegetables,
&amp;c., through it, rejecting all such as will not pass. Add the
whole, or a part of the strained vegetables to the soup, which
should not be thicker in consistency than a good thick potato
soup.</p>

<p>Next stew one dozen good French prunes in a claret-glassful of
port wine, which also strain through a sieve, rejecting stones,
&amp;c., and add the strained portion to the soup; then boil the
whole, strain it once more, add to it all the forcemeat and egg
balls, the brain cakes, tongue, &amp;c., and serve up, adding to it
more salt, wine, or sauce, if needed.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This soup properly made is without its equal.</p>

<h3><a name="H21" id="H21"></a>FISH</h3>

<p><b><a name="R114" id="R114"></a>114.&mdash;Fish Mooloo</b>
</p>

<p>Fry the fish and let it cool. Scrape a cocoanut, put a teacupful
of hot water into it, rub it well, strain it and put aside; then
put two spoonfuls more of water; strain this also; cut up three or
four green chilies, and as many onions as you like, with half a
garlic. Fry them with a little ghee, and whilst frying put the last
straining of the cocoanut water in with the ingredients till it is
dry; then add the first water of the nut, and pour the whole over
the fish, with some vinegar, ginger, whole pepper, and salt to your
taste.</p>

<p><b><a name="R115" id="R115"></a>115.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Fry in a little ghee three or four chilies cut up, half a clove
of garlic, and some sliced onions. When half fried, add two
tablespoonfuls of cocoanut milk, and continue to fry until dry;
then stir into it a teacupful of cocoanut milk, a little vinegar,
some sliced ginger, peppercorns, and salt to taste, and while hot
pour it over a cold fried or boiled fish.</p>

<p><b><a name="R116" id="R116"></a>116.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up a fish into small, two-inch squares, and fry in ghee,
with egg, bread-crumbs, and turmeric, of a nice brown colour. Boil
in cocoanut milk some sliced green ginger and sliced green chilies;
then add the fish, with salt to taste, and let it stew until the
sauce has thickened. Serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R117" id="R117"></a>117.&mdash;Prawn Cutlet</b>
</p>

<p>Shell and wash the prawns; remove the heads, but leave the
tails; slit them down in the centre, and gently beat them flat with
a rolling-pin; sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and some
finely-minced soup herbs; rub them over with yolk of eggs, and
dredge with flour; fry over a very moderate fire to a rich light
brown colour. Garnish the dish with fried green parsley, or serve
up with tomato sauce gravy as per recipe No. 300.</p>

<p><b><a name="R118" id="R118"></a>118.&mdash;Crabs in Shell</b>
</p>

<p>Clean and boil the crabs in salt; remove them out of the shells;
pick and clean them well, and reserve the coral for dressing.</p>

<p>Chop and mince fine the crabs; add some onion and ginger juice,
a little lime-juice, pepper, and salt, and a little mushroom
catsup. Melt some butter, and fry the mixture in it until the
butter be absorbed; then add a little stock, and remove from the
fire immediately the stock begins to dry. Butter the shells, and
fill with the mixture. The meat of six crabs will refill five
shells. Take some finely-sifted bread-crumbs; grind down the coral,
and put it over the mixture on the shells, with the bread-crumbs,
and bits of butter; bake for a few minutes.</p>

<p><b><a name="R119" id="R119"></a>119.&mdash;Tamarind Fish</b>
</p>

<p>Make a thick pickle of ripe tamarinds, good English vinegar, and
a little salt; pass through a sieve, rejecting all stones and
fibres. Select really good fresh hilsa fish, full size, with roes.
Remove all the scales and fins, cut away the heads and tails,
remove the roes, clean out the fish inside, and then slice up, an
inch thick. Wipe away all blood, &amp;c., with a clean dry towel.
Care must be taken to use no water in the cleaning of the fish or
in the preparation of the pickle. The board on which the fish is
cut up, and also the knife, must be very clean. After all the
blood, &amp;c., has been thoroughly cleaned and wiped away, lay out
the slices of fish and roe on a clean dish, sprinkle thickly with
salt, and place over them a wire dish-cover to keep away the flies.
Four or five hours afterwards put a layer of the pickle into a
wide-mouthed bottle or jar, and a thick coating of pickle over each
slice of fish and the roes, after washing away the salt with a
little vinegar; lay them in order in the jar, until the last of the
fish is put in; then be careful to put in a very thick layer of the
pickle. Cork the jar securely, and tie it down with a good bladder
to keep it air-tight, and in three weeks it will be fit for use. It
is desirable to fill each jar well up to the mouth, to effect which
the jars or bottles to be selected should be of the required
size.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If the fish be really fresh, all the ingredients of
good quality, and no water used in the operation of cleaning and
pickling, the jars well filled, and mouths secured with sound
bladder, the fish will keep good for months, and will be fit to
send home.</p>

<p><b><a name="R120" id="R120"></a>120.&mdash;Smoked Fish</b>
</p>

<p>The mango fish, beckty, or hilsa should be cut down the back,
spread open, and well washed and salted. Have a bright charcoal
fire, and sprinkle over it some bran, with brown sugar; cover the
fire with an open-work bamboo basket, having over it a coarse
duster; arrange the fish over the duster, and allow them to smoke.
When one side has browned, turn and brown the other side. As the
smoke decreases, add more bran, and fan up the fire. A duster
thrown over the fish while smoking will facilitate the
operation.</p>

<p><b><a name="R121" id="R121"></a>121.&mdash;Dried Prawns</b>
</p>

<p>Strip the prawns of their shells; keep them for a day in salt
mixed with turmeric; then string and put them out in the sun daily
for fifteen or twenty days.</p>

<p><b><a name="R122" id="R122"></a>122.&mdash;Prawn Powder</b>
</p>

<p>Take a seer of dry prawns; wash them well, dry over the fire
until crisp, pound fine, with some red pepper and nutmeg, pass
through a sieve, and bottle for use. A teaspoonful spread over
bread and butter is considered a relish.</p>

<h3><a name="H22" id="H22"></a>JOINTS, MADE DISHES, ETC.</h3>

<p><b><a name="R123" id="R123"></a>123.&mdash;Corned Round of
Beef</b>
</p>

<p>Select a good round of beef four days previously to it being
required for the table, together with two seers of cooking salt,
eight fresh juicy limes, one anna-worth of saltpetre, and a
tablespoonful of suckur, a description of moist brown sugar. Pound
fine the saltpetre; put the rind of four limes, pared fine, into a
marble mortar, with a tablespoonful of brandy or other spirit;
bruise and pound it well, adding to it the suckur or brown sugar,
and gradually half the powdered saltpetre; mix all well together.
Take one seer of the salt, and mix into it the contents of the
marble mortar; divide the mixture into four equal parts, and rub
briskly one-fourth part of it into the round; puncture the beef
lightly during the operation with a clean bright steel sailmaker's
needle, to allow the mixture to penetrate more freely. An hour or
two after take another fourth of the mixture; squeeze into it the
juice of the four limes from which the rind had been removed, and
repeat the operation of rubbing it into the round, puncturing it
lightly with the needle; turn the beef over from side to side
continually, so that one side do not soak or steep more in the
brine than another; repeat the operation of rubbing it well several
times during the day. Next morning place it on a dry dish, and rub
into it another fourth part of the prepared salt; let it stand for
an hour or so, then pour over it the old brine; repeat the rubbing
two or three times during the day, turning the beef continually. On
the third day rub half of the remaining saltpetre into the beef
dry, and allow it to stand for an hour or two; then add the rest of
the saltpetre and the juice of the four limes to the remaining
fourth part of the mixture, in which keep turning and rubbing the
beef during the day as before; in the evening pour over it the
stale brine, cover it thickly with the one seer of remaining salt,
and place a heavy weight upon it, until required to be boiled the
next day.</p>

<p><b><a name="R124" id="R124"></a>124.&mdash;Beef a la Mode</b>
</p>

<p>Corn a round of beef in every particular as directed above, and
twenty-four hours previously to its being cooked lard it as follows
with the undermentioned ingredients:&mdash;Four pounds of lard or
fat bacon, half a tablespoonful of cinnamon powdered, half a seer
or one pound of finely-powdered pepper, one tablespoonful of cloves
powdered, and four tablespoonfuls of chutnee strained through
muslin. Mix the ground pepper, ground hot spices, and strained
chutnee with a claret-glassful of mixed sauces, such as Harvey,
walnut, Worcestershire, tap, tomato, &amp;c. Cut up into long
narrow slips the lard or bacon to correspond in thickness with the
larding-pin, and lay the slips into the mixture of spices, sauces,
&amp;c., for an hour or two before larding the beef, which should
be larded through and through, and as closely as possible.</p>

<p>Cook it the next day, either in plain water, with half a pint of
vinegar, and with bay-leaves and peppercorns, as is usual, or in a
preparation of claret or champagne with vinegar, bay-leaves,
&amp;c. This is not necessary, but it tends to the improvement of
the flavour at some considerable cost.</p>

<p><b><a name="R125" id="R125"></a>125.&mdash;Le Fricandeau de
Veau</b>
</p>

<p>Take a large leg of veal; remove the knuckle-bone; corn and lard
it in all respects like a beef &agrave; la mode, reducing the
ingredients in proportion to the difference in size and weight
between a round of beef and the leg of veal. Boil, baste, and glaze
it well in the liquor in which it is boiled. Serve up with all
sorts of boiled and glazed vegetables.</p>

<p><b><a name="R126" id="R126"></a>126.&mdash;Hunter's Beef, or
Spiced Beef</b>
</p>

<p>Corn a round of beef, as per recipe No. 123, with the addition
of large quantities of finely-ground pepper and hot spices. Some of
the pepper and spice should be well rubbed in with the saltpetre,
and the beef should be punctured well the whole time with a needle
to insure the saltpetre and spices penetrating. After the dry
saltpetre and spice have been well rubbed in, prepare a mixture of
salt, saltpetre, suckur, lemon-rind, pepper, and spice, and rub in
one-fourth of the mixture, continuing to puncture the beef. Add
subsequently to the brine the juice of lemon, and observe closely
all the instructions given in recipe No. 123. On the seventh day
remove the beef from the brine; rub it well with two tablespoonfuls
of finely-powdered spices and pepper; inclose it thoroughly in
skins of fat, and then in a strong coarse pie-crust, and bake it in
a good oven. A baker's oven is the best.</p>

<p><b><a name="R127" id="R127"></a>127.&mdash;Collared Brisket</b>
</p>

<p>Bone a brisket of beef; rub into it saltpetre, suckur or brown
sugar, and one seer of salt, with some lime-juice; keep it in the
brine for thirty-six hours, rubbing it continually. Then remove it
from the brine, and clear away all the salt. Roll the beef tightly
into a collar, secure it well, inclose it in a stout duster, and
boil it.</p>

<p><b><a name="R128" id="R128"></a>128.&mdash;Spiced Collared
Brisket</b>
</p>

<p>The process is the same as the above, but if the beef be
required to keep for any lengthened time the quantity of salt ought
to be doubled, the beef kept in the brine for seventy-two hours,
and hot spices, pepper, chutnee, and sauces added. The beef after
being rolled should be packed in the skin of fat, then in a coarse
pastry, instead of in plantain-leaf, and baked in a baker's
oven.</p>

<p><b><a name="R129" id="R129"></a>129.&mdash;Pigeons with Petit
Pois</b>
</p>

<p>Kill and feather, with plunging into hot water, four young,
full-grown pigeons, taking care not to break their skins; singe
them, to destroy any remaining feathers; then wash them in three or
four cold waters, cut them in halves, dredge them well with salt
and finely-sifted pepper, and allow to remain for an hour. Then
boil up two tablespoonfuls of ghee or lard, and fry the birds to a
rich brown, turning them over. When sufficiently browned, put in a
cupful of beef stock, and allow to simmer until the birds are quite
tender; pour over them a tin of petit pois with their gravy, and
serve up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R130" id="R130"></a>130.&mdash;Ducks with Green
Olives</b>
</p>

<p>Choose young, full-grown, tender ducks; feather and singe them
as directed in the foregoing recipe, after which wash them in three
or four cold waters; stuff the ducks according to recipe No. 325,
and bake in a deep dish in a moderate oven until brown; then add a
good beef stock with sliced onions, and bake until the stock is
reduced; remove the ducks, and put into the pan the contents of a
bottle of olives stoned, and allow to bake for ten or fifteen
minutes to soften the olives; place the ducks on a clean dish,
arrange the olives round the ducks, and pour the gravy over. Serve
up hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R131" id="R131"></a>131.&mdash;Kidney Stew</b>
</p>

<p>Steep in lukewarm water for a few minutes a dozen mutton
kidneys, and remove the white skin or coat which will become
perceptible; cut into halves or quarter them, wash in three or four
waters, and allow them to remain as long as possible in pepper,
salt, and the juice of onions, ginger, and garlic; boil up three
dessertspoonfuls of ghee or lard in a deep frying-pan, throw in the
kidneys with the juice, put in half a clove of garlic, and cover
over the whole with eight large Patna onions sliced each into eight
slices, and separated so as to cover over the whole surface of the
pan; pour over it as much hot stock as will keep all the onions
under, and simmer over a slow fire until the onions disappear, when
serve up quite hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R132" id="R132"></a>132.&mdash;French Mutton
Chops</b>
</p>

<p>Take half a dozen chops cut from a breast of mutton, throwing
away the intermediate bones&mdash;that is to say, allow the meat of
two chops to remain on one bone. Wash, dry, and steep the chops for
an hour or two before dinner in the juice of onions, ginger, and
garlic&mdash;say four teaspoonfuls of the first to three of the
second and two of the last. Mix on a large board pepper, salt, and
flour, with which dredge the chops thoroughly, and fry quickly in
boiling ghee or lard, taking care in turning over and removing the
chops not to use a fork or anything likely to occasion any wound to
the chops, which should be held by the bones with a pair of
pincers. Serve up hot immediately they have become of a good rich
brown colour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R133" id="R133"></a>133.&mdash;Mutton Stew</b>
</p>

<p>Cut up a breast of mutton in the usual way for a stew; wash and
dry the meat. Take of the juice of onions one tablespoonful, of
ginger half a tablespoonful, and of garlic a quarter of a
tablespoonful; mix with the meat, add pepper and salt, and allow to
stand for any time from one to four hours.</p>

<p>Fry in a large stewpan two tablespoonfuls of ghee or lard, and
when on the boil fry to a nice brown all the meat only; afterwards
pour in the liquor in which the meat has been steeped, and allow to
simmer for fifteen or twenty minutes; thicken some stock with a
teaspoonful of flour, and add it to the stew; allow to simmer until
the meat is perfectly tender.</p>

<p>If vegetables be required (the addition of which, however, is
not considered any improvement), the original gravy, before adding
the stock, must be removed and set aside.</p>

<p>Let the vegetables, consisting of, say, potatoes, carrots,
turnips, and cut-up and sliced cabbage, after being cleaned, remain
for an hour or two in cold water; lay them over the meat, and pour
in hot stock sufficient to cover the whole of the meat and
vegetables, and allow to simmer over a brisk coal fire until quite
tender; then pour into the pot the original gravy which had been
removed, and serve up hot.</p>

<p>Or, instead of the vegetables named above, take only twenty-five
or thirty tomatoes, in which case the stock should be lessened, as
the tomatoes produce a large amount of liquid, and do not require
as much boiling as the harder vegetables.</p>

<p><b><a name="R134" id="R134"></a>134.&mdash;Mutton Brains and
Love Apples</b>
</p>

<p>Take six brains, sixteen to twenty large tomatoes, two chittacks
or four ounces of butter, and eight biscuits. Wash the brains well;
clean, boil, and halve, or cut each into three pieces; thoroughly
butter the dish which will be put on the table; dredge it well with
finely-powdered biscuit; lay in the brains; cut the tomatoes, and
lay them in the dish between the brains, the cut ends upwards; add
a small cupful of good stock, and, after sprinkling a sufficient
quantity of pepper and salt as a seasoning, dredge thickly over
with the ground biscuit-powder, and bake of a rich brown. Serve up
hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R135" id="R135"></a>135.&mdash;Kid Roasted Whole</b>
</p>

<p>Bespeak from a butcher a whole kid, with its head on.</p>

<p>Prepare a stuffing as per recipe No. 323 or 325, and after
cleaning the kid, stuff into it the stuffing; break the joints of
the legs, and fold and truss them like a pig; then put it up to
roast, basting it the whole time with beef suet melted down, to
which add hot water and salt. Serve up in a sitting posture like a
pig, and with a lime in the mouth.</p>

<p><b><a name="R136" id="R136"></a>136.&mdash;Potato Pie</b>
</p>

<p>Boil and mash down some potatoes, with pepper, salt, milk, and
butter; line a pie-dish a quarter of an inch thick with the mash;
arrange in it a nicely-browned mutton, beef, or chicken stew, cover
it over with a thick coat of the mashed potatoes, and bake for a
quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Make a good rich veal mince, mixed with a little ham, and some
sippets of bread-crumb cut into small squares, diamonds, &amp;c.,
and fried in butter; line the pie-dish with mashed potatoes as
above directed; fill into it the veal mince, with plenty of gravy;
arrange the sippets, cover over with a thick crust of the mashed
potatoes, and bake for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R138" id="R138"></a>138.&mdash;Beef Steak and Pigeon
Pie</b>
</p>

<p>This should consist of a slice of good steak, two pounds of
beef, one chittack or two ounces of ghee, a teaspoonful of salt,
two fresh limes, four young pigeons, twelve oysters, twelve curry
onions cut lengthways into fine slices, a teaspoonful of ground
pepper, some sweet herbs, and a dessertspoonful of flour.</p>

<p>Cut up the steak into pieces three inches long, and two inches
or two and a half wide, by half an inch thick. Cut and divide each
pigeon into four pieces; put up two pounds of beef with sufficient
water to make a good strong gravy, throwing in all the scraggy
parts and other rejections of the steak and pigeons. Warm the ghee,
and fry in it the sliced onions; throw in, well dredged with the
flour, the steaks and pigeons, and after frying a while add the
pepper, salt, soup herbs, and some of the rind of the limes, and
about half the beef gravy. Set the whole on a slow fire, and simmer
until the meat is tender; allow to cool; then add the oysters and
the remaining gravy, with the juice of two limes; put into a dish
lined with pastry, cover over the whole with a pastry crust, and
bake.</p>

<p>Cut a leg of veal into small pieces, or a breast into chops, and
parboil in water enough to fill the pie-dish. When about half
stewed take the veal out; season the gravy with pepper, salt, a
little mace, and a little bacon; dredge in a little flour; line the
sides of the dish with a pie-crust; arrange the meat, pour in the
gravy, cover it with a pie-crust, and bake it for an hour.</p>

when it is quite tender. Prepare a strong gravy or soup with two
pounds of beef, well seasoned with ground white pepper, salt, and
soup herbs.</p>

<p>Bruise into fine powder two ounces of some good English cheese;
take a dessertspoonful of very dry mustard, half a teaspoonful of
very finely powdered white pepper, about two teaspoonfuls of salt,
and two chittacks or four ounces of butter. Pound very fine a
couple of crisp biscuits.</p>

<p>Pour over the boiled macaroni sufficient beef gravy or stock to
entirely cover it; then put in all the pepper, salt, and mustard,
but only half the ground cheese. Set it to simmer over a slow fire
until the gravy begins to dry, and the macaroni acquires some
consistency. Then with three ounces of butter (free of water)
butter well the baking-dish; pour into it the macaroni; mix the
remaining ground cheese with the powered biscuit, and strew it over
the pie; cut into small pieces the remaining ounce of butter, and
throw that also over the pie; then put the dish into an oven, and
bake to a fine light but rich brown colour. Ten to fifteen minutes'
baking will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Prepare a good pie-crust with one seer and a quarter of soojee,
half a seer of flour, and half a seer of suet, as per recipe No.
199.</p>

<p>Clean and trim the leg, cutting away the end of the
knuckle-bone, and any other projections likely to injure the
dumpling. Sprinkle it well with ground pepper and some salt, and
confine it securely in the pastry, closing all joinings with the
aid of a little water. Place the dumpling into a strong napkin,
previously buttered and dredged with flour; tie it securely, and
allow it to boil from three to four hours. Care must be taken that
during the whole process of boiling the dumpling remains suspended
in the water, and not resting on the bottom of the pan. On removing
it from the boiler, plunge it immediately into a large tureen of
cold water for two or three minutes. This will strengthen the
pastry and prevent its bursting or breaking while it is being
served up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R146" id="R146"></a>146.&mdash;Sausage Rolls</b>
</p>

<p>Take equal portions of cold roast veal and ham, or cold fowl and
tongue; chop them together very small; season with a teaspoonful of
powdered sweet herbs, and a spoonful of mixed salt and cayenne
pepper; mix well together. Put three tablespoonfuls of the meat
well rolled together into enough pastry (pie-crust recipe No. 199)
to cover it. When you have used up the whole of your materials,
bake them for half an hour in a brisk oven. These rolls are
excellent eating, either hot or cold, and are especially adapted
for travelling, gipsy, boating, or pic-nic parties.</p>

<h3><a name="H23" id="H23"></a>VEGETABLES</h3>

<p>All vegetables should be boiled quickly, and, with the exception
of spinach, in an open vessel, skimming them carefully.</p>

<p>Herbs of all sorts should be gathered when in flower, and on a
dry day, and, being well cleaned from dust and dirt, tied up in
small bunches and dried before the fire. They may then be kept in
paper bags labelled; or rubbed to a powder, sifted, and put into
bottles and labelled.</p>

will require more than an hour; drain them in a colander, and put
them immediately into a dish with a slice of fresh butter in it.
Some people think it an improvement to boil a small bunch of mint
with the peas; it is then minced finely, and laid in small heaps at
the end or sides of the dish. If peas are allowed to stand in the
water after being boiled they lose their colour.</p>

<p><b><a name="R195" id="R195"></a>195.&mdash;To Stew Young Peas
and Lettuce</b>
</p>

<p>Wash and make perfectly clean one or two heads of cabbage
lettuce, pick off the outside leaves, and lay them for two hours in
cold water with a little salt in it; then slice them, and put them
into a saucepan, with a quart or three pints of peas, three
tablespoonfuls of gravy, a bit of butter dredged with flour, some
pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of pounded loaf sugar. Let them
stew, closely covered, till the peas are soft.</p>

<p><b><a name="R196" id="R196"></a>196.&mdash;Peas for a
Second-course Dish, a la Francais</b>
</p>

<p>Put a quart of fine green peas, together with a bit of butter
the size of a walnut, into as much warm water as will cover them,
in which let them stand for eight or ten minutes. Strain off the
water, put them into a saucepan, cover it, stir them frequently,
and when a little tender add a bunch of parsley and a young onion,
nearly a dessertspoonful of loaf sugar, and an ounce of butter
mixed with a teaspoonful of flour; keep stirring them now and then
till the peas be tender, and add, if they become too thick, a
tablespoonful of hot water. Before serving, take out the onion and
bunch of parsley.</p>

<p><b><a name="R197" id="R197"></a>197.&mdash;To Steam Peas</b>
</p>

<p>Shell and close-pack the peas securely in a large quantity of
lettuce-salad leaves; put the package into a stewpan over a
moderate fire for the ordinary time required to boil peas, say half
an hour, when they will be ready.</p>

<p><b><a name="R198" id="R198"></a>198.&mdash;Vegetable Mash</b>

Tarts</b>
</p>

<p>To every three ounces of flour take one ounce of soojee, two
ounces of beef suet, and a little salt; pick and clean the suet,
pound it in a mortar, and make a flat circular cake of it; make a
dough of the flour and soojee, knead it well, divide it into two
equal parts, and make them into two flat circular cakes quite as
large as the suet cake; roll the three together, placing the suet
cake between the two flour cakes; double the whole up twice, and
roll it out again, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p><b><a name="R200" id="R200"></a>200.&mdash;Pastry for Friar
Tuck's Mock Venison Pastry Pie</b>
</p>

<p>Take of veal one pound, and of udder one pound; pick, clean, and
wash them; chop, mince, and pound them in a mortar; season with
salt and white pepper; fix the mixture with the yolk and white of
an egg well beaten up; pass it through a sieve, rejecting all that
will not pass; and form it into a flat circular cake.</p>

<p>Make a dough of two pounds and a half of flour and half a pound
of soojee; add a little salt, and knead it well; then form two
cakes of the dough; place the veal and udder cake between, and roll
out the three very carefully; double up the whole and roll it out
again, when it will be ready.</p>

<p>The pie-dish should be lined thickly with the pastry, and,
although a single layer should cover the top of the pie, the sides
and edges of the dish should be built up high with it; a double
layer of the crust is not interdicted to cover the top of the pie
if it will not interfere with raising it up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R201" id="R201"></a>201.&mdash;Custard</b>

<p>Boil very tender the rind of half an orange, and beat it in a
mortar until it is very fine; put it to a spoonful of the best
brandy, the juice of an orange, four ounces of loaf sugar, and the
yolk of four eggs; beat them altogether for ten minutes, and then
pour in by degrees a pint of boiling milk; beat them until cold;
then put them in custard-cups into a dish of hot water; let them
stand till they are set; then take them out, and stick preserved
orange-peel on the top. This forms a fine-flavoured dish, and may
be served up hot or cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R203" id="R203"></a>203.&mdash;Chocolate Custard</b>

quantity of water; put two pints of pure milk over the fire, and
let it boil; then add powdered loaf sugar to your taste, and a
<i>little</i> salt; meanwhile, beat up the chocolate with some of
the milk as it boils, and mix it well; pour it into the boiling
milk, which you must keep in motion; add the yolks of eight eggs
well beaten up; keep stirring in, or rather milling the mixture,
until of sufficient consistency; when cool enough put the custards
into glasses.</p>

sweeten to taste with the best pounded loaf sugar; add to it a
quarter of a pound of Jordan almonds well bruised in a marble
mortar; pour the mixture into a clean newly-tinned copper pan; stir
into it a seer of good cold milk; have a brisk flaming fire ready.
Put the pan on the fire; never cease stirring it, keeping the spoon
as much as possible in the centre of the pan; reduce the flame
after it has boiled for fifteen minutes, and continue to boil for a
few minutes longer, until the custard is of the consistency
required.</p>

<p><b><a name="R206" id="R206"></a>206.&mdash;Rose-bloom

isinglass in a little water; when nearly cool, mix it into a quart
of good rich milk; mix in the almonds the peel of a small lemon and
a stick of cinnamon; sweeten to taste with good clean sugar; let it
stand for two or three hours; then put it into a pan, and let it
boil for six or eight minutes, stirring it constantly; strain
through muslin, and keep stirring it until nearly cold; then pour
it into moulds.</p>

<p><b><a name="R209" id="R209"></a>209.&mdash;Rice Blanc Mange</b>

quart of boiling milk, in which had been dissolved one-eighth of an
ounce of isinglass, a stick of cinnamon, and the peel of half a
small lemon; sweeten to taste; boil it from ten to fifteen minutes,
stirring it carefully all the while; remove it from the fire, and
mix into it briskly a tablespoonful of pounded almonds, and pour it
while scalding hot into moulds previously dipped in <i>cold</i>
water.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If it be desired to tint it in streaks like marble,
drop into the mould every here and there, at the time of pouring

quart of milk.</p>

<p><b><a name="R211" id="R211"></a>211.&mdash;Christmas Plum
Pudding (Indian Way)</b>
</p>

<p>This pudding may be made a few days before it is required for
the table.</p>

<p>Take of cleaned and picked raisins one pound and a half,
currants half a pound, finely-grated bread-crumbs three-quarters of
a pound, finely-sliced mixed peel half a pound, finely-minced suet
three-quarters of a pound, and sugar three-quarters of a pound. Mix
all these well together with half a teaspoonful of finely-powdered
mixed spices, say cinnamon, nutmeg, and mace; then moisten the
mixture with half a pound of butter free of water, twelve eggs well
beaten, and a wineglassful of brandy, stirring it well the whole
time, that the ingredients may be thoroughly mixed.</p>

<p>Butter a large piece of cloth or napkin; dredge it well with
flour; put the mixture into it, and tie it down tightly; after
boiling it steadily for seven hours take it out of the boiler and
hang it up immediately, until the day it is intended to be eaten,
when it should be boiled again for fully two hours, care being
taken that the water is boiling before the pudding is put into it.
Then turn it out of the towel, and serve up with brandy sauce.</p>

<p><b><a name="R212" id="R212"></a>212.&mdash;Bombay Pudding</b>
</p>

<p>Take two pounds or one seer of soojee, half roast it, then boil
it in water until it becomes very thick; butter a soup-plate or any
other dish of about the same depth; pour the boiled soojee into it;
when it has cooled and congealed, cut it into eight or more cakes;
rub the cakes over with the yolk of an egg, dredge with
finely-sifted flour, and fry in ghee until they acquire a rich
brown colour. Arrange them in a dish, and pour over them a thick
syrup flavoured with lemon-juice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R213" id="R213"></a>213.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Make a good sweet custard and set it aside; rasp fine a
cocoanut, and fry it in a little butter with grated nutmeg; pour
into it gradually a wineglassful of brandy, stirring it all the
time; have a pudding-dish lined with a good puff paste; pour the
fried cocoanut gradually into the custard, stirring it well all the
while; fill the pudding-dish with the mixture, and bake it in a
gentle oven for fifteen to twenty minutes, or until the pudding is
cooked.</p>

<p><b><a name="R214" id="R214"></a>214.&mdash;Cocoanut Rice
Pudding</b>
</p>

<p>Soak a breakfastcupful of fine rice in water until quite soft;
scoop out the contents of a hard cocoanut; extract all the milk
with a little boiling-hot water, then boil the rice in it, sweeten
it to taste with some date jagree or treacle, and put in a few
grains of aniseed. Pour the mixture into a buttered pudding-dish
and bake it slightly.</p>

<p><b><a name="R215" id="R215"></a>215.&mdash;Indian Lemon
Pudding</b>
</p>

<p>Take four chittacks or eight ounces of butter free of water, six
chittacks or twelve ounces of white sugar, twelve fresh eggs, four
wineglassfuls of lemon or lime juice, and four tablespoonfuls of
finely-grated bread-crumbs. Mix the butter and the sugar, add the
yolks of the eggs, then the lime-juice and bread-crumbs, and when
the oven is ready add the whites of the eggs well beaten up, put
the whole into a buttered pudding-dish, and bake it
immediately.</p>

<p><b><a name="R216" id="R216"></a>216.&mdash;Marmalade Pudding</b>
</p>

<p>This pudding requires care in mixing the ingredients thoroughly
together, but it proves so excellent when eaten, either cold or
hot, that it fully repays the trouble of preparation. Shred six
ounces of fresh beef suet, and chop it up fine; mix it with two
ounces of moist sugar, a quarter of a pound of well-grated
bread-crumbs, and then stir in half a pint of new milk; when these
are all mixed, add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, whisk all
together for a quarter of an hour, and set it to stand on a cold
stone for an hour. Butter a pudding-dish or mould thickly, place a
layer of the above mixture in it, then a layer of marmalade,
another layer of mixture, and so on alternately until the mixture
is exhausted. For the above quantity about one pound of marmalade
will be required. Whisk the whites of the eggs with a little loaf
sugar and orange-flower water, place the froth at the top of the
pudding, and bake for an hour and a half in a moderate oven.</p>

<p><b><a name="R217" id="R217"></a>217.&mdash;Custard Pudding</b>
</p>

<p>Mix with a pint of cream or milk six well-beaten eggs, two
tablespoonfuls of finely-sifted flour, half a small nutmeg grated,
or an equal quantity of pounded cinnamon, a tablespoonful of
pounded loaf sugar, and a little salt; put it into a cloth or
buttered basin, that will exactly hold it, and boil it for half an
hour. Serve with wine sauce.</p>

<p><b><a name="R218" id="R218"></a>218.&mdash;Macaroni</b>
</p>

<p>Take the yolks and white of two fresh eggs, and as much
finely-sifted flour (English or American preferable to country) as
will make a good dough of the consistency of dough for pie-crusts
without the addition of any water; roll it out to its full extent
on a large board to about the thickness of an eight-anna piece;
then cut it up into small squares, diamonds, or circles, or into
any shape or design you please, which must be done quickly, as
within an hour of its being rolled out the pastry will harden. It
may be used immediately, or in the winter it may be kept good for a
few days.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If pipe macaroni be required, cut the macaroni in
ribbons of the required width, dredge some flour over it, and put
it lengthways over glass pipes, joining the two cut ends with the
aid of a little raw egg, and draw the pipes out as the pastry
hardens round them. For pipe macaroni, the pastry should be rolled
finer.</p>

<p><b><a name="R219" id="R219"></a>219.&mdash;Tart and Pie Crusts
of Soojee</b>
</p>

<p>To one seer and a quarter of soojee add half a seer of suet and
a teaspoonful of salt. Thoroughly clean the suet, remove all the
skin and other objectionable particles, chop, mince, and pound fine
in a mortar. Damp the soojee for half an hour before kneading it,
then knead it with the suet and a little of the yeast, recipe No.
283; divide it into parts, dredge it with flour, and roll in
layers; repeat the operation two or three times, and the pastry
when baked will be light and flaky. Half a seer of flour will be
required for dredging and rolling.</p>

<p><b><a name="R220" id="R220"></a>220.&mdash;Chappatee or
Hand-Bread</b>
</p>

<p>The native hand-bread is made simply of wheat-flour and water;
the addition of a little salt would be an improvement. Make a good
dough of flour and water, take a piece about the size of an egg,
roll it out to the circumference of a half-plate, and bake it over
an iron or earthen plate.</p>

<p><b><a name="R221" id="R221"></a>221.&mdash;Dalpooree</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare a dal chur churree, recipe No. 93; put it into a marble
mortar, and reduce it to a fine paste. Prepare an ordinary pie
pastry; take two pieces of the prepared dough, each of the size of
a walnut; shape them into two small bowls; take as much of the dal
paste as will make a ball the size of a walnut; put it into one of
the bowls of dough, and cover it over with the other bowl, and then
roll out the whole very carefully to the size of a dinner-plate,
and fry in ghee of a very light yellow colour. The lighter and
thinner dalpoorees can be made the better. They should be eaten
hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R222" id="R222"></a>222.&mdash;Dal Pittas</b>

<p><b><a name="R224" id="R224"></a>224.&mdash;Prawn Doopiaja
Loaf</b>
</p>

<p>Pare away very finely all the outer brown crust of the bread,
without injuring the inner crust; cut out of the top of the loaf a
small square sufficiently large to extract from within all the
crumb, leaving the shell complete; then fill the loaf up to the top
either with some prawn doopiaja minced, or with the prawn cofta
curry, No. 37, and as much gravy as it will take; replace the
square bit at the top, bake it to a light brown, and serve up
hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R225" id="R225"></a>225.&mdash;Fowl Doopiaja
Loaf</b>

that the shell of the bread is stuffed with either a fowl doopiaja,
recipe No. 23, or with the chicken cofta curry, recipe No. 34; all
the bones of the fowl will require to be removed before the bread
is stuffed with the curry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R226" id="R226"></a>226.&mdash;Falooree</b>

<p>Take of the finely-sifted flour of the chunna ka dal, which has
been previously parched, one seer; six large Patna onions finely
sliced and chopped; eight fresh green chilies sliced very fine; a
tablespoonful each of finely-chopped soa mattee, saug, and parsley;
a dessertspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of finely-ground green
ginger. Put the seer of dal-flour into a large deep pan, and mix
into it all the above condiments; then keep adding to it water,
very gradually and in small quantities at a time, mixing it briskly
the whole while, until it is of a consistency that if poured on a
plate from a spoon it will incline to a pyramid, or if dropped into
a glass of water will not readily dissolve, but drop to the bottom
<i>en masse</i>. In this state the mixture will be ready to
fry.</p>

<p>Take half a seer of the best mustard oil; put it into a deep
frying-pan with some fine slices of lemon-peel, and fry it or cook
it thoroughly; remove three-fourths of the cooked oil from the
frying-pan, and into the remainder, while boiling and bubbling,
with a tablespoon pour in the preparation in the shape of rocks,
and allow to brown, turning them over so that top and bottom may be
of the same colour. As the oil is being expended clear the pan of
all particles which may accumulate, pour in some more of the
ready-cooked oil, and continue to fry until all the mixture is
fried. They should be eaten hot.</p>

<p><b><a name="R227" id="R227"></a>227.&mdash;Cocoanut Pittas</b>

<p>Scrape finely a cocoanut, brown it with some jagree and a few
grains of the black cardamom seed, and set it aside; then prepare a
pastry of finely-sifted rice-flour (it must be kneaded with
boiling-hot water, and will not roll out); take as much as the size
of a duck's egg, and press it out flat in the palm of your hand to
the size of a large saucer; put a tablespoonful of the fried
cocoanut into it, and close it up in a half-moon shape, with the
help of a little water. Have a wide-mouthed large earthen pot of
boiling water; stretch and tie over its mouth a napkin, and steam
the pittas or cakes over them; they will be ready in half an hour,

<p>An experienced man ought to be engaged to mix the ingredients,
which, if properly done, will take fully one hour.</p>

<p>Have two large glazed earthen preserving-pans; put the sugar
into one, and bruise it well down, breaking all the lumps; add to
it three pounds and three-quarters of butter; then throw in one by
one all the yolks of the forty eggs, and throw the whites into the
other preserving-pan, mixing the sugar, butter, and the yolks the
whole while briskly and without ceasing. While one man is mixing
these ingredients another ought to be actively employed in beating
up the whites of the eggs unceasingly for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>After the butter has been well mixed with the sugar and eggs,
dredge in all the finely-pounded spices and the caraway-seeds;
after a while dredge in the flour and soojee in small quantities at
a time (this must be well mixed); the currants, raisins, and
preserves, with the almonds, are next to be added. By this time the
man will have been engaged in mixing the ingredients fully
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>After the raisins, &amp;c., have been thoroughly mixed, pour in
the brandy very gradually, and in small quantities at a time, and
last of all add the well-beaten whites of the forty eggs: the
stirring now must be very brisk to effect a perfect mixture of the
whites of the eggs right through; fill quickly into the moulds, and
bake without a moment's delay in a brisk baker's oven.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The moulds ought to be lined with paper and well
buttered.</p>

be done with as little use of the rolling-pin as possible; either
take small pieces, and roll them into oblong cakes, or roll out a
large piece and cut it into squares or rounds; prick a pattern
round the edge of each cake with the back of a knife, and arrange
slices of candied peel, caraway-seeds, and caraway comfits in a

saffron and two ounces of spirits of wine of the strength of
sixty-two degrees over proof. Let it stand until the spirit is
tinted of a deep yellow; then strain it for use.</p>

<p>Red.&mdash;This is produced by infusing during a fortnight two
ounces of red sandal-wood in a pint of spirits of wine. It at the
expiration of that time the colour should not be dark enough, a
pinch of subcarbonate of soda will give it the required tint.</p>

<p>Pink.&mdash;Dissolve half an ounce of cochineal in a sufficient
quantity of spirits of wine.</p>

<p>Green.&mdash;Put a handful of well-cleansed vine-leaves or
spinach into a decanter, fill with spirits of wine, and let it
stand in the sun for ten or twelve days; strain when the wine has
become of a bright green.</p>

brown sugar or suckur, and half a drachm of hops. Dry the hops in
the sun, and then reduce them to fine powder, by pounding in a
mortar. Mix the soojee or flour and powdered hops with a little
water, just sufficient to make a stiff dough; then add the sugar
and knead all well together. Roll the leaven into a ball, wrap it
lightly in a clean cloth, then in a blanket, and put it away for
three days, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If worked up or kneaded once daily during the three
days, the fermentation will be more perfect.</p>

<p>The above quantity will be sufficient for twenty-five pounds
weight of bread.</p>

<p><b><a name="R285" id="R285"></a>285.&mdash;Casserole of
Potatoes</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and boil some good mealy potatoes, pound them, and mix with
them some butter, cream, and a little salt; put them about an inch
and a half high upon a dish, and leave an opening in the centre;
bake it of a light brown colour, and take out as much more from the
centre as will admit of a ragout, fricassee cutlet, or macaroni
being put in.</p>

<p><b><a name="R286" id="R286"></a>286.&mdash;Rissoles or
Croquets</b>
</p>

<p>Mince very finely some cold roast meat or fowl and a small bit
of bacon; season it with grated nutmeg and salt; moisten it with
cream, and make it up into good-sized balls; dip them into yolks of

a pound of fresh suet; then pound till it is as smooth as a paste,
and carefully pick out all the threads and sinews; add four
well-beaten eggs, half a pint of rich cream, and as much grated and
sifted bread as will make it sufficiently consistent to form into
rolls resembling corks; and season with salt and pepper. Boil the
corks in some good stock, or in boiling water, or fry them.</p>

<p><b><a name="R288" id="R288"></a>288.&mdash;Forcemeat</b>
</p>

<p>Mince very finely the following ingredients:&mdash;Three ounces
of fresh beef suet, one of fat bacon, three of raw or dressed veal,
two of grated bread, a little grated lemon-eel, nutmeg, pepper,
salt, and finely-minced parsley; mix all well together, and bind

dripping, or use it for stuffing.</p>

<p><b><a name="R289" id="R289"></a>289.&mdash;Forcemeat balls</b>
</p>

<p>May be made of pounded veal or mutton, minced beef suet or fat
of veal, taking an equal quantity of meat, suet, and grated
bread-crumbs; add a bit of fat bacon chopped, season with salt,
pepper, and grated nutmeg, and mix all well together with the
beaten yolk of an egg.</p>

<p><b><a name="R290" id="R290"></a>290.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>To half a pound of beef or veal add half a pound of udder; mince
and pound to a pulp in a mortar; remove all gristle and parts not
pulped, and mix with it the finely-grated crumbs of a slice of
stale bread, and a tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley; soften
down the whole with some milk or gravy, then add a teaspoonful of
finely-pounded pepper and a teaspoonful of salt; rub down the whole
well together, and add the whites and yolks of two raw eggs, well
beaten up; make into balls. If for soup, the size of the balls
should be that of small nutmegs; if to garnish made dishes, make
them into the size of large walnuts or of ordinary croquets or
rissoles.</p>

<p><b><a name="R291" id="R291"></a>291.&mdash;Forcemeat Onions</b>
</p>

<p>Peel four or five large onions, scoop out the inside, fill them
with forcemeat, and roast them in an oven.</p>

<p>They may be served with roast turkey or fowl.</p>

sort of white fish; mince it finely, and add the same proportions
of minced suet and grated bread, a few chopped oysters, and some
boiled parsley chopped; season with a little pounded onion, cayenne
pepper, salt, nutmeg, and lemon-peel; mix all well together, and
bind it with the well-beaten yolks of eggs; roll it into small
balls, and fry them.</p>

<p><b><a name="R293" id="R293"></a>293.&mdash;Egg Balls</b>
</p>

<p>Grind down to a powder or paste the yolks of four hard-boiled
eggs; add a teaspoonful of very finely sifted flour, some tender
leaves of parsley, finely chopped, and a little white pepper and
salt; grind, and mix all well together with the yolk of a raw egg;
roll into small balls, and boil for two or three minutes.</p>

<p><b><a name="R294" id="R294"></a>294.&mdash;Brain Cakes</b>
</p>

<p>Having previously boiled down the brains, bruise them, and add a
teaspoonful of finely-sifted flour, some grated nutmeg, pepper, and
salt, and a raw egg; then roll out like piecrust to the thickness
of a rupee, punch out cakes of the size of Spanish dollars, and fry
them.</p>

<p><b><a name="R295" id="R295"></a>295.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Take the brains and remove any veins, &amp;c.; chop well with a
knife, add salt, nutmeg, and pepper, a little raw egg, and flour
enough to make them stick together; mix well, make into cakes about

<p>Bruise down when quite cold the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs,
and rub into them half a teaspoonful of pepper, one of salt and one
tablespoonful of sugar, with two to three tablespoonfuls of
prepared mustard. When well rubbed together, add very gradually
four tablespoonfuls of oil, stirring it the whole while; when well
mixed add a dessertspoonful of Lee and Perrin's Worcestershire
sauce, one tablespoonful and a half of white wine vinegar, and a
dessertspoonful of tarragon vinegar.</p>

<p>If the sauce be required thicker than usual, take either a
larger number of eggs or a teaspoonful or a dessertspoonful of corn
or other flour; put it into a cup, pour over it the quantity of
vinegar prescribed above, place the cup in a saucepan of boiling
water over the fire, and stir until the vinegar thickens to the
desired consistency; then mix it gradually into the preparation of
eggs, oil, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b><a name="R297" id="R297"></a>297.&mdash;Sauce for Lobster
Salad</b>
</p>

<p>Observe all the directions given in the foregoing recipe, adding
to the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs some of the spawn or red coral
of the lobsters and a dash of essence of anchovy. Omit the sugar,
and instead of the Worcestershire sauce substitute mushroom catsup
and Indian tapp sauce.</p>

<p><b><a name="R298" id="R298"></a>298.&mdash;Excellent Fish
Sauce</b>
</p>

<p>Wash and bone two anchovies, and rub them up in a mortar with a
quarter of a pound of butter and half a teaspoonful of flour. Put
these into a small saucepan; then add to the yolks of three eggs
well beaten up, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, a small
bunch of sweet herbs, consisting of parsley, green onions, and a
bay-leaf, and a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg; stir these over
the fire until the sauce is thick, but be careful not to let it
boil, or it will burn. Serve it up in a sauce-tureen.</p>

<p><b><a name="R299" id="R299"></a>299.&mdash;Sauce for Boiled
Mutton or Boiled Brisket of Beef</b>
</p>

<p>Warm a saucepan, and melt in it two chittacks or four ounces of
butter free of water; fry in it a tablespoonful of finely-sliced
onions; when half browned, put in gradually two tablespoonfuls of
finely-sifted flour, taking care to keep stirring it the whole
time; then add gradually eight chittacks or sixteen ounces of pure
milk, and lastly two wineglasses of vinegar, with finely-pounded
white pepper and salt to taste. This sauce is without its
equal.</p>

Sauce for Made Dishes</b>
</p>

<p>Take forty tomatoes (halved), some soup herbs, and salt; boil
them in a little stock; strain through a sieve, replace on the
fire, and thicken with the addition, more or less, of a
dessertspoonful of arrowroot or corn or other flour, to obtain any
required consistency; finally add a teaspoonful of good English
vinegar; if a sharper gravy sauce be required, instead of the
vinegar add either a dessertspoonful of tapp sauce or a teaspoonful
of chili vinegar.</p>

consistency; then pour it over the minced parsley and capers, mix
well together, and it is ready for use.</p>

<p><b><a name="R304" id="R304"></a>304.&mdash;Onion Sauce</b>
</p>

<p>Clean and boil six or eight good Patna onions; allow the water
to drain away; fry to a light brown colour, in two chittacks or
four ounces of butter, free of water, a dessertspoonful of
finely-sliced curry onions; then gradually mix into it a
tablespoonful of finely-sifted flour and half a seer of milk,
taking care through the whole operation to keep stirring the sauce
to prevent its lumping; add a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter of
a teaspoonful of pepper; last of all add the boiled onions, and in
a few minutes the sauce will be ready.</p>

<p><b><a name="R305" id="R305"></a>305.&mdash;White Onion Sauce</b>

</p>

<p>Dust a little flour over a quarter of a pound of butter, and put

two ounces of butter; then throw in the above ingredients and warm
up well; moisten with stock, and then stuff the bird.</p>

<p><b><a name="R327" id="R327"></a>327.&mdash;Stuffing for Roast
Duck</b>
</p>

<p>Slice into fine long strips or ribbons as much of the heart or
inside of a young tender cabbage as will suffice for stuffing; wash
and dry it through a colander, and shake it up in a napkin, without
crushing or destroying the crispness of the leaves; take for the
stuffing as much only as will suffice to stuff the number of ducks
intended to be dressed; add for each duck a teaspoonful of
finely-pounded pepper, and one of salt, with three cloves of
garlic, and two chittacks or four ounces of butter free of water;
stuff your birds and bake or roast as you please.</p>

perfectly boiled down strain it lightly without bruising the onions
or carrots; let it cool, and remove all the fat; then, with a dozen
cloves and the juice and rind of a lemon, boil it again, adding a
tablespoonful of soy or any other dark-coloured, rich, and
well-flavoured sauce; beat up to a light froth the whites of four
eggs, and clear the soup or jelly; add a wineglass of brown sherry,

salt for thirty-six hours; drain away the salt water, and boil them
in the three quarts of vinegar; when cool, remove them into a
preserving-pan, mix in all the condiments and other ingredients,
and allow the whole to simmer for half an hour, pouring in the
syrup gradually, and mixing all the time, until the vinegar and
syrup have been absorbed, and the chutnee has acquired the desired
consistency; bottle and cork when perfectly cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R336" id="R336"></a>336.&mdash;Hot Sweet Mango
Chutnee</b>
</p>

<p>Ingredients:&mdash;A hundred green mangoes, the syrup of four
pounds of sugar and three quarts of vinegar, four pounds of
tamarinds, stoned and strained, three quarts of vinegar, eight or
ten bay-leaves, one pound of green chilies, two pounds of sliced
ginger, one pound of cloves of garlic, one pound of raisins, and
two pounds of salt.</p>

<p>Peel and cut the mangoes into fine slices, and steep them in
salt for twenty-four to thirty-six hours; remove the mangoes from
the salt water, and boil them in three quarts of vinegar; when
quite cool, lay them in a preserving-pan, sprinkle over them the
remaining salt, add all the condiments, tamarinds, raisins,
&amp;c., and allow the whole to simmer for half an hour, stirring
all the time, with the syrup. It should not be bottled until quite
cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R337" id="R337"></a>337.&mdash;Tamarind Chutnee</b>
</p>

<p>Ingredients:&mdash;Four pounds of ripe tamarinds without the
stones, a quarter of a pound each of ground chilies, ginger, and
garlic, two ounces of ground cinnamon, half a pound of picked
currants, half a pound of raisins (the small Cabool are the best),
two pounds of soft sugar, a quarter of a pound of salt, and a quart
of vinegar.</p>

<p>Put the whole into a glazed earthen preserving-pan, pour over it
a quart of vinegar or syrup, or as much as will entirely cover the
mixture, and mix all well together; then allow it to simmer over a
quick fire until the vinegar or syrup is absorbed and the chutnee
thickened to the required consistency; it must be stirred during
the whole time it is on the fire.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The two pounds of sugar and the quart of vinegar may
be made into syrup or used separately.</p>

<p><b><a name="R338" id="R338"></a>338.&mdash;Cussoondee</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and slice fine a hundred green mangoes, steep them in salt
for twelve hours, then put them under a heavy pressure for two
hours, and drain away all the water; then mix with them half a
pound each of ground chilies, ginger, and garlic, half a pound of
bruised mustard-seed, two pounds of tamarinds without the stones,
and some salt; when the whole is thoroughly mixed, pour over it as
much warmed or cooked mustard oil as will entirely cover it, and
cook it for ten to fifteen minutes over a brisk fire; when cold
bottle it, taking care that it is kept several inches well under
the oil, and that it is well corked, or it will spoil.</p>

<p><b><a name="R339" id="R339"></a>339.&mdash;Mango Amchoor</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and quarter some green mangoes; sprinkle with salt, and
expose them to the sun until they begin to dry up; then rub them
with dry pounded turmeric, chilies, and dry ginger; sprinkle more
salt, and expose them to the sun again, until they are quite dried
up, when they may be bottled and kept for use.</p>

<p><b><a name="R340" id="R340"></a>340.&mdash;Pickled Cabbage</b>
</p>

<p>Quarter a full-sized cabbage, keep it in salt for forty-eight
hours, and then drain away all the water. Prepare a pickle or brine
of salt and water in the proportion of eight ounces of salt to
twenty-four ounces of water, and boil it with half an ounce each of
peppercorns and bay-leaves; pack the cabbage loose in a
wide-mouthed stone jar, and pour over it the cold pickle or brine,
which should have been boiled the day before. Care must be taken to
keep the mouth of the jar always airtight, or the cabbage will rot.
When required for use, take out as much as will be required, steep
it in fresh cold water for an hour or two, and then boil it the
same as fresh cabbage.</p>

<p><b><a name="R341" id="R341"></a>341.&mdash;Red Cabbage
Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>Slice the cabbage, and sprinkle salt over each layer; after
twenty-four hours remove it into a colander, and allow all the salt
water to drain; then put the cabbage into a pan, pour in sufficient
boiling vinegar to cover it, and add a few slices of red beetroot;
when cold, put it into glass bottles and cork down.</p>

<p><b><a name="R342" id="R342"></a>342.&mdash;Red Cauliflower
Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>This is a very uncommon pickle, and looks particularly pretty in
white bottles. Cut the cauliflower into pieces of equal sizes,
sprinkle with salt, and place it in the sun for a couple of days.
Make a syrup of vinegar and sugar: to every quart of vinegar put a
quarter of a pound of sugar, a few sticks of cinnamon, and as much
sliced or bruised and pounded red beet as will give the vinegar a
deep red colour. When all the salt water has drained away, put the
cauliflower into a pan, and pour over it the boiling-hot vinegar or
syrup through a fine sieve, in order to leave behind the sticks of
cinnamon and fibres of the beetroot; when cold, put the pickle into
nice white bottles and cork.</p>

<p><b><a name="R343" id="R343"></a>343.&mdash;Patna or Bombay Onion
Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>According to the size and number of bottles, take the small or
button onions; remove the outer coat, wash and dry them thoroughly,
throw them into a pan with some vinegar, and parboil them; set the
vinegar aside, after filtering it, for shrimp, cucumber, and other
salads, or for the preparation of mustard. Put the parboiled onions
when cold into wide-mouthed bottles, laying them alternately with
fresh red chilies, a few black peppercorns, some finely-sliced
green ginger, and a little salt. Fill the bottles with vinegar, and
cork them.</p>

<p><b><a name="R344" id="R344"></a>344.&mdash;Mangoes Pickled
Whole</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and divide some large-sized mangoes sufficiently to admit
of the stones being easily extracted; rub them over with salt, and
expose them to the sun for two or three days; then dry them with a
napkin, and stuff each mango with a few cloves of garlic,
finely-sliced chilies and ginger, some cullungee seeds, a clove or
two, and a stick or two of cinnamon; tie them securely with strong
sewing cotton, and put them into bottles, with vinegar sufficient
to cover them; cork the bottles well, and expose them to the sun
for fifteen to twenty days. The pickle will be ready for use in
three or four months.</p>

<p>To prevent the pickle spoiling, it is not unusual to pour a
tablespoonful or two of mustard oil over it when in the bottle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R345" id="R345"></a>345.&mdash;Sweet Mango
Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and quarter a hundred green mangoes, and steep them in salt
for thirty-six hours; drain off the salt water, wipe the mangoes
dry, and put them into a preserving-pan, with a seer or two pounds
of sliced ginger, and half a seer of chilies finely sliced; pour in
a syrup made of sugar and vinegar (half a seer of the former in two
quarts of the latter), and allow the whole to simmer for ten to
fifteen minutes; bottle when quite cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R346" id="R346"></a>346.&mdash;Long Plum Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>Take the long plums, or what the natives call <i>nar kollee
bhyar</i>; remove the peel, and keep them in salt in the sun for a
day or two; drain away the salt water, and put them into bottles,
in layers alternately with fresh chilies, cloves of garlic, ginger
finely sliced, and peppercorns; add a little more salt, and pour in
as much vinegar as will cover the whole; cork and expose to the sun
for fifteen to twenty days. This is one of the most delicious of
Indian pickles; it will not be fit for use until the plums have
pickled for six months.</p>

<p><b><a name="R347" id="R347"></a>347.&mdash;Sweet Long Plum
Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>Is made in every respect according to the foregoing recipe, with
the addition of a syrup in the proportion of a quarter of a pound
of sugar to every quart of vinegar, and a few sticks of
cinnamon.</p>

<p><b><a name="R348" id="R348"></a>348.&mdash;Round Plum Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>Get the perfectly ripe fruit, which the natives call
<i>cool</i>; put them into a damp cloth, and roll them about to
free them of dust; sprinkle them well with salt, and stand them in
the sun for three or four days; then drain away all the water, and
bottle the plums alternately with cloves of garlic, green or fresh
red chilies, sliced ginger, peppercorns, and ground mustard-seed;
add a little salt, fill up the bottles with vinegar, and cork, and
expose them to the sun for fifteen to twenty days.</p>

<p><b><a name="R349" id="R349"></a>349.&mdash;Round Plum Pickle
with Mustard Oil</b>
</p>

<p>Is made like the above, the only difference being that some
mustard oil is poured over the vinegar, and allowed to float about
an eighth of an inch thick over the surface.</p>

<p><b><a name="R350" id="R350"></a>350.&mdash;Dry Fruit Pickle</b>
</p>

<p>This is the pickle of all pickles. Take equal quantities of "dry
dates," called the <i>shawarah</i>, <i>khobanee</i>, or Arabian
apricots; <i>allobhokara</i>, a species of Arabian plum or damson;
English prunes, rather of the dry sort; and Normandy dry pippins.
Wash and clean them thoroughly, particularly the Arabian dry
fruits, which are very dirty, and dry them well in the sun. Stew
the dry dates for ten to fifteen minutes, cut them up into rings,
and throw away the stones. Make a syrup of good French vinegar, in
the proportion of a quarter of a pound of good clean sugar to a
quart of French vinegar. After quartering the pippins, arrange them
and the other fruit in a wide-mouthed bottle in alternate layers,
with finely-sliced ginger, peppercorns, sticks of cinnamon, and
small sprinklings of salt; then pour over the whole as much of the
vinegar syrup as will entirely cover the fruit; cork the bottle
well down, expose it to the sun for a few days, and it will be fit
for use in a month.</p>

<p><b><a name="R351" id="R351"></a>351.&mdash;Green Mint
Vinegar</b>
</p>

<p>Put into a wide-mouthed bottle enough fresh, clean mint-leaves
to fill it loosely, and fill it up with good vinegar. After it has
been stopped close for two or three weeks, pour off the vinegar
clear into another bottle, and keep it well corked for use. Serve
with lamb or kid when fresh mint cannot be obtained.</p>

<p><b><a name="R352" id="R352"></a>352.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Fill a wide-mouthed bottle with fresh, full-grown, green
mint-leaves; pour in a quart of vinegar; after ten or fifteen days
strain away the liquor, and re-fill the bottle with fresh leaves;
pour back the liquor, and after it has steeped for ten or fifteen
days longer, strain and bottle for use as required.</p>

<p><b><a name="R353" id="R353"></a>353.&mdash;Horseradish
Vinegar</b>
</p>

<p>To three ounces of finely-scraped horseradish add a quart of
vinegar and a drachm of cayenne, some black pepper and
celery-seeds, and one ounce of bruised onions; after eight or ten
days filter the vinegar, which will serve as an excellent relish
for cold beef, salads, &amp;c., and for the preparation of
mustard.</p>

<p><b><a name="R354" id="R354"></a>354.&mdash;Chili Vinegar</b>
</p>

<p>Pick, clean, and put into a glass-stoppered bottle one chittack
or two ounces of birds'-eye chilies, and pour over them a pint and
half of the best vinegar; after a month's time filter through
blotting-paper a pint of the vinegar; add to what remains half a
pint more of vinegar, and expose it to the sun for a few days, when
the second portion will also be ready for use.</p>

<p><b><a name="R355" id="R355"></a>355.&mdash;Essence of
Chilies</b>
</p>

<p>Pick one chittack or two ounces of the best dried Patna chilies;
expose them to a hot sun for an hour; then pound them to as fine a
powder as possible; put the powder into a stoppered bottle with a
teaspoonful of salt, pour over it as much vinegar only as will form
a limp paste, and expose it to the sun for a few days; then pass it
through muslin, adding to it as much more vinegar as will reduce it
to the consistency of some thick sauce.</p>

<p><b><a name="R356" id="R356"></a>356.&mdash;To Preserve
Lime-juice</b>
</p>

<p>Squeeze and strain a pint of lime-juice; put into a basin one
pound of double-refined sugar finely pounded and sifted, add the
lime-juice, and stir it with a silver spoon till the sugar is
perfectly dissolved. Bottle it, and cork it tightly; seal the cork,
or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry, cool place.</p>

<p><b><a name="R357" id="R357"></a>357.&mdash;To Purify
Lime-juice</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of strained lime-juice add an ounce of well-burnt and
finely-pounded animal charcoal; in twelve hours filter it through
blotting-paper, and put it into small phials; cork these tightly,
and keep them in a cool place; a thick crust will form beneath the
corks, and the mucilage will fall to the bottom.</p>

<p><b><a name="R358" id="R358"></a>358.&mdash;Green Mint-juice</b>
</p>

<p>If for immediate use, extract it with water, but if required to
keep for a few days, take brandy for the purpose. Pick and clean
half a dozen large stalks of good fresh mint, and pound the leaves
in a mortar with a dessertspoonful of water, or with brandy, then
put them into muslin and squeeze out all the liquor. Juice may be
extracted a second time by a little more water or brandy being
added, and the leaves rebruised and pressed through muslin.</p>

<p><b><a name="R359" id="R359"></a>359.&mdash;Green
Ginger-juice</b>
</p>

<p>Is extracted in the same manner as mint-juice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R360" id="R360"></a>360.&mdash;Juice of Onions and
Garlic</b>
</p>

<p>Is extracted by pounding the condiment in a mortar with a little
water, and squeezing the juice through muslin.</p>

<p><b><a name="R361" id="R361"></a>361.&mdash;Mustard</b>
</p>

<p>There are various ways of preparing mustard for the table, each
with its admirers, yet in nine houses out of ten it is often so
execrably done as to mar the best dinner, through the loss of its
piquancy and pungency. Be the quantity ever so small, it should
never be prepared in a cup, but in a soup or other deep plate. The
dry mustard, with a little salt, should first be well rubbed down
with the back of a spoon; the water, vinegar, or other liquid
should then be gradually added, and mixed gently until the required
consistency has been obtained; it should then be mixed briskly,
turning the spoon one way only, and in a few minutes the pungency
of the mustard will tell on the eyes; put it immediately into the
mustard-pot, <i>and cork it</i>, removing the cork only when the
mustard is required for use. It is a mistake to suppose that the
little silver or plated lid to a mustard-pot is intended, or is
sufficient, to preserve the piquancy and pungency of the condiment.
The practice which prevails in some houses of allowing the spoon to
remain immersed in the mustard, which has probably been prepared
with vinegar, the spoon perhaps being a plated one, is very
objectionable.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to give any further instructions,
excepting that hot water should not be used. Some like mustard
prepared simply with water; others prefer weak vinegar and water.
It is also prepared with plain vinegar, with tarragon vinegar, with
vinegar taken from pickles and capers, and with onion and garlic
juice. The best mustard for roast beef is that prepared with
horseradish; the most delicate flavoured is that made with tarragon
vinegar, or vinegar taken from capers.</p>

<h3><a name="H27" id="H27"></a>INDIAN PRESERVES, JAMS, JELLIES, AND
MARMALADES</h3>

<p>Hints about the Making of Preserves</p>

<p>It is not generally known that boiling fruit a long time without
sugar, in an open preserving-pan, and skimming it well, is a very
economical way, as the whole of the scum rises from the fruit, and
boiling without a cover allows the evaporation of all the watery
particles. Preserves boiled in this way keep firm and
well-flavoured. Jam made as above, with the addition of a quarter
of a pound of good pure sugar to every pound of fruit, is
excellent.</p>

<p><b><a name="R362" id="R362"></a>362.&mdash;To Detect
Adulteration of Sugar</b>
</p>

<p>The adulteration of brown sugar may be detected by dissolving a
little in a glass of clear water; if sand or any similar substance
be present, it will after a while fall to the bottom of the glass.
If white sugar, adulterated with flour, chalk, or other similar
substances, be dissolved in clear water, the latter will become
opaque or discoloured, and a sediment will be formed at the bottom
of the glass.</p>

<p><b><a name="R363" id="R363"></a>363.&mdash;White Syrup</b>
</p>

<p>Put a quart of water over the fire in a well-tinned and clean
copper stewpan; when on the boil, drop into it lump by lump one
pound of the best loaf sugar; let it well boil up, and after all
the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, pour it into a broad dish to
cool. When cold it is fit for use.</p>

<p><b><a name="R364" id="R364"></a>364.&mdash;Brown Syrup</b>
</p>

<p>Take a pound of brown sugar-candy called <i>misseree</i>, and
prepare the syrup as directed above. After all the sugar is
thoroughly dissolved, strain it through a sheet of stout
blotting-paper spread on muslin, and allow the syrup to drip into a
broad dish. Use it when quite cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R365" id="R365"></a>365.&mdash;To Clarify Sugar</b>
</p>

<p>To every three pounds of loaf sugar allow the beaten white of
one egg and a pint and a half of water; break the sugar small, put
it into a nicely cleaned brass pan, and pour the water over it; let
it stand some time before it be put upon the fire; then add the
beaten white of the egg, stir till the sugar be entirely dissolved,
and when it boils up pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water, and
let it boil up a second time; then remove it from the fire and let
it settle for fifteen minutes; carefully take off all the scum, put
it again on the fire, and boil till sufficiently thick, or, if
required, till candy high: in order to ascertain this, drop a
little from a spoon into a cup of cold water, and if it become
quite hard, it is sufficiently done; or dip the handle of a wooden
spoon into the sugar, plunge it into cold water, and draw off the
sugar which adheres; if the sugar be hard and snaps, the fruit to
be preserved must be instantly put in and boiled.</p>

<p><b><a name="R366" id="R366"></a>366.&mdash;Capillaire</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of water add three pounds of lump sugar, one pound of
soft sugar, and the whites and yolks of two eggs well beaten up;
boil it gently, and skim well; on the scum ceasing to rise, remove
the pan from the fire, add two ounces of the best orange-flower
water, and strain through flannel.</p>

<p><b><a name="R367" id="R367"></a>367.&mdash;Ceylon Moss, Seaweed,
and Iceland Moss Preserves</b>
</p>

<p>Steep the moss or weed for two or three days in fresh water,
changing the water two or three times a day; wash it well once
before boiling it; to every seer or two pounds of the weed add a
wineglassful of the best vinegar; allow it to simmer over a gentle
fire until it thickens, so as to congeal on a glass; then strain
the moss or weed through a towel, pour the liquid into clarified
sugar or syrup, and boil them together for half an hour; pour the
jelly into large wide dishes, and when quite cold cut it into
cakes. If desired, the jelly may be coloured or tinted with
cochineal.</p>

<p><b><a name="R368" id="R368"></a>368.&mdash;Guava Jelly</b>
</p>

<p>Select ripe guavas, and as they are peeled and quartered throw
them into a large bowl of fresh clean water; then boil them in as
much other clean water as will only cover the fruit, and when
perfectly tender, so as to dissolve to the touch, strain through a
fine sieve or towel without breaking or pressing the fruit, and
allow it to drip through for twelve to eighteen or twenty-four
hours if necessary. Put the juice on the fire again without a cover
to the preserving-pan; boil and skim well; add gradually good clean
sugar to your taste; when nearly done, add lime-juice in the
proportion of ten large juicy limes to every hundred guavas; after
it has boiled until no more scum rises, and the jelly is quite
clear, pour it while the jelly is warm into glass or stone jars,
and cork them down when quite cold. A hundred guavas will give two
to two and a half jars of jelly, and will take from two to two and
a half hours' cooking or boiling.</p>

<p><b><a name="R369" id="R369"></a>369.&mdash;Guava Cheese</b>
</p>

<p>After all the water or juice has drained from the guavas boiled
for jelly, pass the fruit or pulp through a sieve, rejecting the
seeds; add lime-juice and sugar to taste, and boil over a slow fire
to a consistency stiff enough for it to remain unmoved in a spoon;
rub a little butter in a mould, fill it with the cheese while hot,
and place it in a heat, or in an expiring oven, to dry; the colour
may be improved with the aid of cochineal.</p>

<p><b><a name="R370" id="R370"></a>370.&mdash;Mango Jelly</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and stone a hundred green mangoes, and cut each into four,
throwing them as they are ready into a solution of weak lime-water,
strained of all sediment. When all have been peeled and stoned,
remove them into a large vessel, pour in as much cold water as will
entirely cover them, and boil them until they are quite dissolved;
then carefully strain the liquid without pressing the fruit, and
let it drip all night. Boil the juice again in an open
preserving-pan, and cut away the scum as it rises; then add
gradually good clean white sugar until it is sweetened to taste;
continue to boil steadily until the scum has ceased to rise, and
the jelly is quite clear and transparent; allow some of it to drop
on a plate and cool; if it congeals, remove the pan and fill the
bottles while the jelly is slightly warm, and cork down when quite
cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R371" id="R371"></a>371.&mdash;Mango Marmalade</b>
</p>

<p>Pass through a sieve the pulp of the mangoes which had been
boiled for jelly; add plenty of clean white sugar, without quite
destroying the acidity of the fruit; boil it over a slow fire until
it acquires the thickness of guava cheese, and bottle while it is
yet warm.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This marmalade is will adapted for rolly-polly
puddings, tarts, mango fool, and the preparation of sauces for
boiled goose, ducks, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b><a name="R372" id="R372"></a>372.&mdash;Green Mango
Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>Select mangoes slightly under the middling size, taking care
that they are not bruised or injured in any way. Steep them in
clean water; grate the outer coat, or peel very finely, so as to
remove thoroughly a fine coat of green from the surface; cut them
sufficiently lengthways to extract the stones, and then throw them
into lime-water. Remove them into a copper preserving-pan with
clean water, and parboil them, skimming them well; throw them into
a sieve, and allow all the water to drain away; have a large
quantity of good syrup prepared, allowing two pounds of sugar to
every twenty-five mangoes; throw the mangoes into the syrup, and
allow them to simmer; cut away the scum until the sugar inclines to
crystallize; then remove the pan from the fire, and put the
preserve into wide-mouthed bottles; before corking them down, it
will be necessary to examine the syrup every two or three days, and
if it be found that it is becoming thin, it will have to be
reboiled; just as the boiling is about to be finished, the mangoes
ought to be put into it to warm up; this precaution must be taken
every time the syrup has been reboiled, until there is no further
appearance of fermentation; the bottles may then be securely corked
down, and the preserve will keep good for years.</p>

<p><b><a name="R373" id="R373"></a>373.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Peel and stone good middling-sized green mangoes, and steep them
in lime-water; parboil them in fresh water, and then in syrup until
it thickens; put them into bottles, and examine them daily; if any
signs of fermentation appear, reboil the syrup, and put in the
fruit at the end of the boiling; the reboiling to be continued
until the syrup has ceased to ferment.</p>

<p>The difference between this and the foregoing preserve is only
in appearance: the former will be of a greenish tint, and the
latter of a rich light brown.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Care must be taken to have plenty of syrup at the
starting, so that at the end of the two or three reboilings there
may be enough left to cover the fruit.</p>

<p><b><a name="R374" id="R374"></a>374.&mdash;Pine-apple
Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>Take care that the pines are not green, nor yet quite ripe;
remove the peel, cutting it deeply, and then all the seeds and
eyes; cut each pine into six slices, lay them in a preserving-pan,
and sprinkle over each layer a good quantity of sugar, a few sticks
of cinnamon, and a few bay-leaves, covering the uppermost layer
with a larger quantity of sugar; allow them to simmer over a
tolerably brisk fire until the sugar has all melted; then reduce
the fire, and continue to simmer until the pines have quite changed
colour and become tender; remove them out of the syrup into a
colander, and allow them to drain, but continue to boil the syrup
with all that drops from the fruit until it has thickened; then
return the fruit into the syrup and finish the boiling. Bottle when
quite cool, but before corking them for good, ascertain the state
of the syrup every two or three days; if it shows signs of
fermentation, remove it from the fruit and reboil it; this
operation must be continued until the syrup has ceased to ferment;
the <i>fruit is not</i> to be reboiled, but only returned into the
syrup when the boiling is about to be finished.</p>

<p><b><a name="R375" id="R375"></a>375.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Finish the preserve by boiling the sliced pines and sugar
together until the fruit has become of quite a dark colour, and the
syrup so thick that it is not likely to ferment. There is, however,
the objection to this method that the fruit becomes more or less
leathery, and is not mellow like that preserved according to the
foregoing recipe.</p>

<p><b><a name="R376" id="R376"></a>376.&mdash;Peach Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>Clean the peaches, slit them with a silver or plated knife, and
remove the stones; have a very strong syrup ready, and while it is
boiling hot throw in the peaches, and let them stand over a slow
fire for six to eight hours; then remove them from the fire, and
twelve hours after drain off the syrup and reboil it; return the
fruit into the syrup, and if it shows any disposition to ferment,
boil it again; when satisfied it will not ferment any more, add a
little brandy, say a wineglassful to every fifty peaches, and boil
the whole over a slow fire for two hours. Bottle when quite cold.
The kernels from the stones may be put in if desired.</p>

<p><b><a name="R377" id="R377"></a>377.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Clean the peaches, and put them with the stones into a
preserving-pan with sufficient water to cover them; allow them to
simmer until quite tender, cutting away the scum, and then spread
them on a dish to cool. Make a syrup, allowing three-quarters of a
pound of sugar to every pound of fruit, and while it is boiling hot
put in the peaches, and boil them gently until the syrup is quite
thick. Two days after drain off the syrup and reboil it, returning
the fruit into it while hot; if at the end of twenty-four or
thirty-six hours it has become thin again, it must be reboiled; a
little brandy should be added finally.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If the peaches are boiled in two waters, the first
may be thrown away, but the second, in which the peaches should be
boiled a longer time, may be taken for making the syrup.</p>

<p><b><a name="R378" id="R378"></a>378.&mdash;Pulwal Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>Take two seers or four pounds of large full-grown pulwals
without any decay; peel, slit, remove the seeds, and throw them
into cold water; wash them thoroughly, and parboil them in clean
water; then put them in a colander, and set them aside to cool.
Prepare a good strong syrup of half a seer of sugar and a quarter
of a seer or half a pound of green ginger well bruised; throw the
pulwals in, and allow them to simmer until the syrup thickens. They
should be removed immediately the colour becomes quite brown, but
the syrup must be kept boiling till it has acquired the proper
consistency; return the pulwals into the syrup, and, if necessary,
reboil it two or three days after, if it appears to have become
thin, or inclined to ferment.</p>

<p><b><a name="R379" id="R379"></a>379.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Take two seers or four pounds of good large fresh pulwals;
thoroughly grate the outer surface, half slit them, remove the
seeds, and throw them into water; parboil them in clean water,
remove them into a colander, and allow them to drain and dry; then
stuff each pulwal with some bruised green ginger, tie or bind them
with fine cotton, put them into a strong syrup made of half a seer
of sugar, and allow them to simmer until they change colour; remove
them, and continue to boil the syrup until it thickens; then return
them into the syrup, and in two or three days reboil the syrup, if
it has become thin, or appears inclined to ferment.</p>

<p><b><a name="R380" id="R380"></a>380.&mdash;Candied Pulwal</b>
</p>

<p>The same process is observed as directed for pulwal preserve,
the chief difference being that hot or boiling clarified sugar or
syrup must be used, and the preserve exposed to the sun, spread out
on fresh oiled paper, to dry.</p>

<p><b><a name="R381" id="R381"></a>381.&mdash;Tipparee (commonly
called Gooseberry) Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>Shell or remove the pods of the tipparees, and wipe away all
dust; prick each with a bamboo or other wooden pin, and put them
into a preserving-pan; strew some sugar over each layer of fruit,
making the final layer of sugar thicker than the others, and simmer
the whole until all the juice has been extracted, and the syrup has
acquired such a consistency that it will congeal if dropped on a
plate; then remove the preserve quickly from the fire, and bottle
while warm.</p>

<p><b><a name="R382" id="R382"></a>382.&mdash;Tipparee Jelly</b>
</p>

<p>Clean and prick the tipparees as in the foregoing recipe, and
put them into a clean well-tinned stewpan, with as much water as
will entirely cover them; boil them until all the juice has run
out; strain the latter into a preserving-pan through fine muslin,
without crushing the fruit, and allow it to simmer for a while,
removing the scum; then add to it fine clean white sugar to taste,
in small quantities at a time, skimming it well all the while; when
nearly ready, put in the juice of two lemons strained through
muslin; when the scum has ceased to rise, and the jelly is clear,
remove the pan from the fire; bottle the jelly while it is warm,
and cork when it is quite cold.</p>

<p><b><a name="R383" id="R383"></a>383.&mdash;Tipparee Cheese or
Marmalade</b>
</p>

<p>Take the fruit which had been boiled for jelly, and pass it
through a fine sieve, leaving the skins behind; clean and prick a
few more tipparees, and add them to the strained fruit; put the
whole into a preserving-pan with sugar, and simmer until of a
sufficient consistency to make into cheese; add some orange
marmalade, in the proportion of a tablespoonful to every mould;
with a feather damp the moulds with melted butter or sweet oil, and
pour into them the cheese while quite hot; place them in cold
water, and turn out the cheeses as soon as they are cool enough to
retain their shape.</p>

<p><b><a name="R384" id="R384"></a>384.&mdash;To Preserve
Tamarinds</b>
</p>

<p>Rid the tamarinds of all the stones; put a layer of sugar in a
wide-mouthed bottle, and over it a layer of stoned tamarinds, then
another layer of sugar, and so on alternately until the bottle is
full; the final layer must be a deep one of sugar. Tie the stopper
down with oiled bladder. This will keep good for years, and prove
serviceable when fresh tamarinds cannot be procured.</p>

<p><b><a name="R385" id="R385"></a>385.&mdash;Bael Preserve</b>
</p>

<p>The fruit must be rather less than half ripe, to enable it to be
cut into firm slices a quarter of an inch thick; carefully remove
the seeds, together with the gum by which they are surrounded, and
throw the slices into cold water; when all the bael is ready,
remove it from the water, and simmer it in a strong syrup over a
slow fire for half an hour, or until it has become of a rich light
brown colour; bottle it when cool, taking care that the fruit is
well covered with syrup.</p>

<p><b><a name="R386" id="R386"></a>386.&mdash;Bael Jam</b>
</p>

<p>The fruit must be half ripe, all the seeds and gum carefully
removed, and the pulp passed through a coarse sieve into a
preserving-pan with the help of a little water; add sugar to taste,
and simmer over a slow fire for half an hour, or until the fruit
and sugar have acquired the consistency of jam; let it cool, and
then bottle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R387" id="R387"></a>387.&mdash;Candied Bael</b>
</p>

<p>The fruit should be selected as for the preserve, cut into
slices, and the seeds and gum removed; after steeping it in cold
water, drain it, and put it in a preserving-pan, with sufficient
boiling clarified sugar or syrup to cover it; simmer it over a slow
fire for half an hour, or until it becomes quite tender; then
remove the pan from the fire, lay the fruit on some fresh oiled
paper spread on tin trays, and expose it to the sun; it will
crystallize in a few hours, and the oil will prevent it adhering to
the paper.</p>

<p><b><a name="R388" id="R388"></a>388.&mdash;Orange Jelly</b>
</p>

<p>Melt an ounce and a half of isinglass and three-quarters of a
pound of fine white sugar in a pint of water; add some orange and
lemon-peel, and boil until it is a good syrup; while warm, add the
juice of ten oranges and two lemons, strain the whole through
flannel, and put it into moulds. The juice of the fruit should not
be boiled.</p>

<p><b><a name="R389" id="R389"></a>389.&mdash;Damson Cheese</b>
</p>

<p>Take damsons that have been bottled for tarts, pass them through
a sieve, and reject the skins and stones; to every pound of the
strained pulp add half a pound of loaf sugar broken small; boil the
whole until it has thickened; then pour it into buttered moulds and
put it in an oven or warm place to dry; when quite firm, remove it
from the moulds and serve up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R390" id="R390"></a>390.&mdash;Apricot Cheese</b>
</p>

<p>Take the Cabool apricots, or those preserved for tarts; if the
former, wash them thoroughly in several waters, parboil and reduce
them to a pulp, and pass them through a sieve, rejecting all the
skin, &amp;c.; add sugar as directed in the foregoing recipe, and a
handful or two of the apricot stones blanched, and boil the whole
until it has thickened sufficiently; then pour it into buttered
moulds, put it into an expiring oven or some warm place to dry, and
when quite firm turn it out of the moulds.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Other bottled fruits sent out to this country for
tarts, <i>not preserved in sugar</i>, are admirably adapted for
converting into marmalades, or for making into "fools."</p>

<p><b><a name="R391" id="R391"></a>391.&mdash;Orange Marmalade</b>
</p>

<p>Take twenty-four oranges and six lemons, and of the best sugar a
quantity equal to the weight of the fruit; grate the rinds of the
oranges and lemons; then mark or cut into quarters and strip off
the rinds without hurting the pulps; stew the rinds until they
become perfectly tender, changing the water two or three times;
then drain them, scrape out a little of the inside, and cut them
into very fine slices or chips; next separate the pips, skin, and
fibrous parts from the pulps, over which pour some water and strain
it off; with this and a little more water prepare a syrup in a
preserving-pan, add to it the whites of two eggs well beaten up,
skim it well, and the moment it begins to boil take it off the
fire; continue to remove the scum, add a little more water, boil,
and strain until the syrup is perfectly clear; then throw in the
chips and boil until they are quite transparent; next put in all
the pulp and juice, and boil until it thickens. To ascertain if it
has been sufficiently cooked, drop a little on a plate and see if
it congeals.</p>

<p><b><a name="R392" id="R392"></a>392.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Stew good fresh ripe oranges till perfectly tender, changing the
water several times; drain them, and cut and remove the rinds
without breaking them or wounding the pulps; weigh the pulps,
having previously removed all the pips, skin, and seeds, and to
every six pounds of fruit add seven of sugar; pour boiling water
over the pips, seeds, &amp;c., strain them, and take the liquor for
the preparation of syrup; skim it well while boiling; when clear,
add to it the rind, having first scraped and thrown away some of
the inside and then cut it up into thin slices or chips. After a
while add the pulp and juice, and boil it up again until it
acquires the consistency of jelly. This is a new method, and
approved by some as being excellent and economical.</p>

<p><b><a name="R393" id="R393"></a>393.&mdash;Indian Way of Making
Calf's-Foot Jelly</b>
</p>

<p>Take twelve large or full-sized calves'-feet, one pound or half
a seer of sugar, eight limes, two oranges, half a dozen blades of
lemon-grass, a tablespoonful of mixed spices (say cinnamon,
cardamoms, mace, nutmeg, and cloves), six eggs, a handful of
isinglass, and a claretglassful of sherry. Having thoroughly washed
the feet, break them up and boil them; allow all the meat to
dissolve over a slow fire, skim away every particle of fat, and
strain the liquid through a coarse napkin; add the sugar, all the
hot spices, and the rinds of two lemons and one orange; simmer the
whole for some time, squeeze in the juice of the eight limes and
the two oranges, together with the isinglass and lemon-grass, and
when it begins to thicken strain it; then reboil until it is
reduced to the required quantity, skimming all the fat. Beat the
whites of the six eggs to a good light froth; add this to the
jelly, and pour it from one pan into another several times, until
it clears; then add the sherry and strain it through flannel,
returning it quickly two or three times until it runs perfectly
bright and clear; fill into glasses or moulds before it
congeals.</p>

<h3><a name="H28" id="H28"></a>HOME-MADE LIQUEURS</h3>

<p><b><a name="R394" id="R394"></a>394.&mdash;Cream of Citron</b>
</p>

<p>Put sixty drops of the oil of citron into a quart of spirits of
wine of the strength of sixty-two degrees overproof; shake it well,
mix with it a quart of syrup and two ounces of yellow colouring
matter, and filter the whole through filtering-paper. If not
sufficiently bright, filter it a second time through some fresh
paper, and bottle it.</p>

<p><b><a name="R395" id="R395"></a>395.&mdash;Cream of Cloves</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of spirits of wine of the strength given in the
foregoing recipe add forty drops of oil of cloves; shake it well,
and mix with it a quart of syrup, and as much yellow colouring
matter as will give it a good colour; filter through
filtering-paper and bottle immediately. It is a delightful liqueur,
and is excellent for relaxed throats.</p>

<p><b><a name="R396" id="R396"></a>396.&mdash;Cream of Noyau</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of spirits of wine sixty-two degrees overproof add
twenty drops of good essential oil of bitter almonds and six drops
of oil of orange; shake it well, and add a quart of syrup; filter
it through paper until it is quite clear.</p>

<p><b><a name="R397" id="R397"></a>397.&mdash;Pink Noyau</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of spirits of wine sixty-two degrees overproof add
fifteen drops of essential oil of bitter almonds, three drops of
oil of roses, four drops of oil of aniseed, and one drop of
tincture of vanilla; shake it well, and mix with it a quart of
syrup and a sufficient quantity of pink colouring matter to make it
of a delicate pink colour; bottle it after filtering.</p>

<p><b><a name="R398" id="R398"></a>398.&mdash;Cream of Aniseed</b>
</p>

<p>Put twenty drops of essential oil of aniseed in a quart of
spirits of wine; after shaking it well, mix with it a quart of
syrup; filter and put it in bottles.</p>

<p><b><a name="R399" id="R399"></a>399.&mdash;Cream of Cinnamon</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of spirits of wine add two drops of oil of cinnamon
and two of oil of roses; shake it well until the oil has thoroughly
dissolved, and add a quart of syrup and a sufficient quantity of
red tincture to produce a bright full colour; it may then be
filtered and bottled. This is an agreeable liqueur, and beneficial
to dyspeptic persons.</p>

<p><b><a name="R400" id="R400"></a>400.&mdash;Rose Cream</b>
</p>

<p>Into a quart of spirits of wine put twelve drops of the oil of
roses and three of oil of nutmeg; shake the mixture well until the
oils are dissolved, and add a quart of syrup, and a sufficient
quantity of pink tincture to produce a fine rose-colour: filter and
bottle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R401" id="R401"></a>401.&mdash;Cream of Mint</b>
</p>

<p>Drop into a quart of spirits of wine twenty-five drops of oil of
mint and three of oil of citron; shake it well, and add a quart of
syrup and as much green colouring tincture as may be necessary:
filter and bottle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R402" id="R402"></a>402.&mdash;Cream of Vanilla</b>
</p>

<p>Put twelve drops of tincture of vanilla into a quart of spirits
of wine; shake it well, and add a quart of syrup; when well mixed,
let it stand for a quarter of an hour; then filter it two or three
times through filtering-paper, but do not filter again if it comes
out bright and clear the first time. This is a most delicious
cordial.</p>

<p><b><a name="R403" id="R403"></a>403.&mdash;Golden Wasser or
Dantzic Brandy</b>
</p>

<p>To a quart of spirits of wine add twelve drops of oil of
aniseed, six of oil of cinnamon, three of oil of roses, and eight
of oil of citron; shake it will until the oils dissolve; then add a
quart of syrup, and filter through filtering-paper: before bottling
the liqueur, stir into it a few squares of leaf-gold cut into very
little bits.</p>

<p><b><a name="R404" id="R404"></a>404.&mdash;Curacao</b>
</p>

<p>Boil a quart of water in a very clean pan, and add to it, bit by
bit, a pound of dark brown sugar-candy; when the latter is
dissolved, increase the fire and let the syrup boil up; then pour
it into a deep dish to cool, dissolve a hundred and twenty drops of
oil of bitter orange in a quart of spirits of wine sixty-two
degrees overproof, and mix with the syrup when quite cold; then
filter and bottle the liqueur.</p>

<p>This is a most difficult liqueur to filter of a clear bright
colour; indeed, all liqueurs in which essential oils extracted from
peals of the lemon tribe are used become so opaque on being mixed
with syrup that the filtering is rendered a most tedious
undertaking.</p>

<p>The proportions given in the above recipes are for the
production of really good strong liqueurs, which will keep good for
years, and improve by age. Liqueurs for immediate consumption need
not be made quite so strong, two parts of syrup and one of spirits
of wine will usually be sufficient; but consumers will be the best
judges of their own tastes. A caution is very necessary against the
free use of the essential oils: they are all harmless in
moderation, but poison if used in excess, and some more powerful
than others.</p>

<p><b><a name="R405" id="R405"></a>405.&mdash;Punch a la Romain</b>
</p>

<p>Squeeze the juice out of eight juicy limes and four lemons or
oranges; strain it through muslin and well mix with it two pounds
of the best loaf sugar; beat to a light froth the whites of ten
fresh eggs, and add gradually to the sugared juice; pour the whole
into a pewter vessel, and place it in a tub containing two seers of
<i>cutcha</i>, or raw ice, stirring it frequently to make it
congeal. Ice two quarts of champagne, and when required add it to
the contents of the pewter vessel; mix all well together, and serve
in green or amber-coloured hock glasses. The addition of a little
rum is considered an improvement.</p>

<p><b><a name="R406" id="R406"></a>406.&mdash;Mint Beer</b>
</p>

<p>Put some bruised fresh-gathered mint-leaves into a large
tankard, and pour over them a bottle of beer well iced, and a
soda-water bottle of sparkling lemonade, also well iced; or use
bottled mint-juice if the beer and lemonade have not been iced, and
stir in a quarter of a pound of crushed ice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R407" id="R407"></a>407.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>To the juice or bruised leaves add sufficient sugar to sweeten,
and pour into the tankard two tumblers of water and two quarts of
beer; stir and serve up with crushed ice, or cool the beer and
water before the preparation.</p>

<p><b><a name="R408" id="R408"></a>408.&mdash;Ginger Beer</b>

mint-leaves, with a seer of crushed ice; add a quart of champagne,
stir briskly, and serve up.</p>

<p><b><a name="R410" id="R410"></a>410.&mdash;Regent Punch</b>
</p>

<p>Mix a quart of sparkling champagne, a claretglassful of brandy,
a wineglassful of old Jamaica rum, and a pint of very strong
<i>pure green</i> tea; sweeten to taste with capillaire or any
other syrup.</p>

<p><b><a name="R411" id="R411"></a>411.&mdash;Milk Punch</b>
</p>

<p>Six quarts of rum and one of brandy, one quart of lime-juice,
two seers of soft sugar, three quarts of cold water, two seers of
pure milk, the rinds of forty limes, and three nutmegs will make
twelve quarts of punch, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Steep for two days in a bottle of the rum the peels of the forty
limes; boil in the three quarts of water the two seers of soft
sugar, and grate in the nutmeg; pour all the rum and syrup into a
large vessel, and add gradually the quart of lime-juice and two
seers of milk, boiling hot, stirring the whole time; let it stand
for an hour or two, then strain through flannel several times until
it drips clear, and bottle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R412" id="R412"></a>412.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Sixteen bottles of rum, three bottles of brandy, four bottles of
lime-juice, eight bottles of milk, twelve bottles of water, eight
seers of sugar, eight nutmegs, and the rinds of eighty limes, will
make thirty-six quarts of milk punch, but of a milder quality than
the foregoing.</p>

<p>The addition of a bottle of cura&ccedil;ao to milk punch is a
great improvement; it may be added after the milk and
lime-juice.</p>

<p><b><a name="R413" id="R413"></a>413.&mdash;Ginger Pop</b>

certain and effectual in arousing the action of the stomach than
either of the preceding draughts.</p>

<p><b><a name="R433" id="R433"></a>433.&mdash;Cure for Tic-doloreux
or Neuralgia</b>
</p>

<p>Mix half a pint of rose-water and two teaspoonfuls of white
vinegar. Apply it to the part affected three or four times a day:
fresh linen should be used at each application. This will, in two
or three days, gradually take the pain away.</p>

<p>At least three hundred "infallible cures" for tic-doloreux have
been discovered, but the disease arises from such various causes
that no remedy can be relied upon. Carbonate of iron cures one;
quinine, another; upon a third neither has any effect. The remedy
above suggested, although safe and simple, takes time to afford
relief. Ten to twenty drops of Collis Browne's chlorodyne have been
found from repeated experience to afford nearly instantaneous
relief, and in some cases subject to periodical return to have
effected almost perfect cures.</p>

<p><b><a name="R434" id="R434"></a>434.&mdash;To Cure Hiccough or
Hiccup</b>
</p>

<p>This spasm is caused by flatulency, indigestion, and acidity. It
may generally be relieved by a sudden fright or surprise, or the
application of cold, also by swallowing two or three mouthfuls of
cold water or a teaspoonful of vinegar, or by eating a small piece
of ice, taking a punch of snuff, or anything that excites
coughing.</p>

<p><b><a name="R435" id="R435"></a>435.&mdash;Cure for Colds</b>
</p>

<p>Total abstinence from liquid food of any kind for a day or two
(known as the dry system) has been known to cure coughs and colds
where it has been persevered in.</p>

<p><b><a name="R436" id="R436"></a>436.&mdash;Mixture for Recent
Coughs</b>
</p>

<p>Mix five ounces of honey, a quarter of a pound of treacle, and
seven ounces of best vinegar, and simmer in a common pipkin for
fifteen minutes; remove it from the fire, and when the mixture has
become lukewarm, add two drachms of ipecacuanha wine. The dose is a
tablespoonful every four hours for adults. This is one of the best
mixtures known for recent cough, and, on account of its pleasant
taste, is particularly eligible for children and infants.</p>

<p><b><a name="R437" id="R437"></a>437.&mdash;Emulsion for Recent

</p>

<p>Mix an ounce of oil of sweet almonds, the yolk of one egg, five
ounces of orange-flower water, half an ounce of mucilage of gum
Arabic, a drachm and a half of ipecacuanha wine, and half an ounce
of syrup of marshmellows. The dose is a tablespoonful when the
cough is troublesome. Half this quantity may be given to young
children.</p>

<p><b><a name="R438" id="R438"></a>438.&mdash;Emulsion for Old
Coughs</b>
</p>

<p>Rub well two drachms of gum ammoniac, gradually adding half a
pint of water; when they are thoroughly mixed, strain them through
linen. This is a useful expectorant in old coughs and asthmas, when
no inflammatory symptoms are present. The dose is from one to two
tablespoonfuls, united with an equal quantity of almond
emulsion.</p>

<p><b><a name="R439" id="R439"></a>439.&mdash;Cure for
Hooping-cough</b>
</p>

<p>Dissolve a scruple of salts of tartar in a quarter of a pint of
water; add ten grains of cochineal, and sweeten with sugar. Give to
an infant the fourth part of a tablespoonful four times a day; two
years old, half a spoonful; from four years, a tablespoonful.</p>

<p><b><a name="R440" id="R440"></a>440.&mdash;Roche's Embrocation
for Hooping-cough</b>
</p>

<p>Mix eight ounces of olive oil, four ounces of oil of amber, and
a sufficient quantity of oil of cloves to scent it strongly. This
is the same as the famous embrocation of Roche. When rubbed on the
chest, it stimulates the skin gently, and is sometimes serviceable
in hooping-cough and the other coughs of children. In hooping-cough
it should not be used for the first ten days of the disease.</p>

<p><b><a name="R441" id="R441"></a>441.&mdash;Valuable Lotion for
Hooping-cough, &amp;c.</b>
</p>

<p>Dissolve one drachm of emetic tartar in two ounces of common
water, and add half an ounce of tincture of Spanish fly. This is a
valuable lotion in the advanced stages of hooping-cough, and is of
much service in all other coughs, both of adults and children. It
is often very useful in removing the distressing cough and
oppression of the chest left after the hoop has quitted the
patient. After it has been rubbed into the chest night and morning
for about a week, it will create a redness, and bring out some
small pustules; it should then be applied only once a day, and if
the part becomes very sore, it may be laid aside altogether, and
the pustules anointed twice a day with simple white ointment. In
very severe cases, however, it will be necessary to continue the
use of this lotion until a large number of pustules appear; and if
they are kept discharging freely by an occasional use of it, the
relief will be more striking and permanent.</p>

<p><b><a name="R442" id="R442"></a>442.&mdash;Warm Plaster</b>
</p>

<p>Melt together with a moderate heat one part of blistering
plaster and fourteen of Burgundy pitch, and mix them so as to form
a plaster. This will be stimulant, and create a slight irritation
on the part to which it is applied. It is used with advantage in
common cough, hooping-cough, sciatica, and local pain.</p>

<p><b><a name="R443" id="R443"></a>443.&mdash;Gargle for Irritation
and Inflammation in the Throat</b>
</p>

<p>Mix two drachms of purified nitre, seven ounces of barley-water,
and seven drachms of acetate of honey. Use frequently.</p>

<p><b><a name="R444" id="R444"></a>444.&mdash;Another Recipe</b>
</p>

<p>Mix half a drachm of muriatic acid and seven ounces of decoction
of black-current leaves or barley-water. This and the preceding
gargle should be used when the object is to reduce the inflammation
in the throat without its proceeding to suppuration. They are
likewise useful in relaxed sore throat. This gargle possesses
cleansing qualities, and should be used when the fauces are clogged
with viscid mucus. It may be made still more detergent, if
necessary, by increasing a little the quantity of acid.</p>

<p><b><a name="R445" id="R445"></a>445.&mdash;A Good Gargle for
Sore Throats</b>
</p>

<p>Mix two drachms of tincture of myrrh, four ounces of water, and
half an ounce of vinegar.</p>

<p><b><a name="R446" id="R446"></a>446.&mdash;Excellent Domestic
Gargle</b>
</p>

<p>Mix together, in a half-pint tumbler, three teaspoonfuls of
vinegar, two of tincture of myrrh, two of honey, and about
one-fourth of a tumbler of port wine; then fill up the tumbler with
lukewarm water, and the gargle will be fit for use. This is both
pleasant and efficacious in all cases of sore throat. If a
decoction of black-currant leaves be used instead of lukewarm
water, it will be much improved.</p>

<p><b><a name="R447" id="R447"></a>447.&mdash;Remedy for

<p>Mix together one ounce each of camphorated spirit, common
vinegar, and spirits of turpentine.</p>

<p><b><a name="R448" id="R448"></a>448.&mdash;Another Recipe</b>
</p>

<p>Put the white of an egg into a saucer, and stir it with a piece
of alum, about the size of a walnut, until it becomes a thick
jelly; apply a portion of it on a piece of lint or two large enough
to cover the sprain, changing it for a fresh one as often as it
gets warm or dry, and keep the limb in a horizontal position.</p>

<p><b><a name="R449" id="R449"></a>449.&mdash;Embrocation for
Sprains and Bruises</b>
</p>

<p>Mix together an ounce and a half of compound liniment of camphor
and half an ounce of tincture of opium. This is a very useful
application to sprains and bruises, after all inflammation has
disappeared, and for rheumatic pains. Warmed and rubbed over the
surface of the abdomen, it is of much service in allaying the pain
of colic unattended by inflammation.</p>

<p><b><a name="R450" id="R450"></a>450.&mdash;Another Recipe</b>

<p><b><a name="R454" id="R454"></a>454.&mdash;Anodyne
Fomentation</b>
</p>

<p>Boil three ounces of white poppy-heads, half an ounce of
elder-flowers, and three pints of water till one pint is
evaporated; then strain out the liquor. This fomentation is used to
relax spasm and relieve acute pain. Sometimes it may be advisable
to add three teaspoonfuls of tincture of opium to it.</p>

<p><b><a name="R455" id="R455"></a>455.&mdash;Common

</p>

<p>Boil an ounce of dried mallows, half an ounce of dried
camomile-flowers, and a pint of water for a quarter of an hour, and
strain. This is a very good fomentation for all common
occasions.</p>

<p><b><a name="R456" id="R456"></a>456.&mdash;Nitric Acid
Lotion</b>
</p>

<p>Mix together two drachms of diluted nitric acid and a pint of
water. This lotion is stimulating and detergent, and is very
serviceable when applied to foul foetid ulcers attended with a thin
ichorous discharge. It is also useful in caries of the bone, and
when there is an impending mortification. It is a favourite lotion
in unhealthy ulcerations, which require the application of a mild
stimulant.</p>

<p><b><a name="R457" id="R457"></a>457.&mdash;Cure for Bowel
Complaint</b>
</p>

<p>Mix half a drachm of rhubarb powder, a drachm of calcined
magnesia, an ounce of paregoric elixir, and half a pint of
peppermint water. Shake up, and take two tablespoonfuls every three
hours till relieved.</p>

<p><b><a name="R458" id="R458"></a>458.&mdash;Another Recipe</b>
</p>

<p>The following is a better prescription for the same
purpose:&mdash;Mix eight ounces of chalk mixture, a drachm of
aromatic confection, three drachms of compound tincture of camphor,
and three or four drops of oil of caraways. Take two tablespoonfuls
every three hours, or oftener if the pain and purging be urgent; a
teaspoonful is a dose for young children, and one tablespoonful for
those of ten or twelve years of age.</p>

<p><b><a name="R459" id="R459"></a>459.&mdash;Compound Infusion of
Senna</b>
</p>

<p>Macerate for an hour in a pint of boiling water, in a lightly
covered vessel, an ounce and a half of senna-leaves and a drachm of
sliced ginger-root, and strain the liquor. This is a useful purging
infusion, in common use among medical men. It is usually given in
conjunction with a little Epsom or Glauber's salts, and forms a
purging mixture of great service in all acute diseases.</p>

<p><b><a name="R460" id="R460"></a>460.&mdash;Warm Purgative

</p>

<p>Put three ounces of senna-leaves, three drachms of bruised
caraway-seeds, a drachm of cardamom-seeds, and four ounces of
stoned raisins into two pints of best brandy; macerate for fourteen
days in a gentle heat, and filter. This is quite equal to the
celebrated Daffy's elixir, and is similar to the tincture of senna
sold at the shops. It is stomachic and purgative, and is
beneficially employed in flatulency, pains in the bowels, gouty
habits, and as an opening medicine for those whose bowels have been
weakened by intemperance. The dose is one, two, or three
tablespoonfuls, in any agreeable vehicle.</p>

<p><b><a name="R461" id="R461"></a>461.&mdash;Tonic Aperient

</p>

<p>Mix three ounces and a half each of decoction of bark and
infusion of senna, three drachms of sulphate of potash, and half an
ounce of compound tincture of bark. Take three tablespoonfuls once
or twice a day, so as to keep the bowels regular; or it may be used
only occasionally, when an aperient is required.</p>

<p><b><a name="R462" id="R462"></a>462.&mdash;Mild Aperient
Pills</b>
</p>

<p>Beat into a mass and divide into twelve pills half a drachm of
compound extract of colocynth, a scruple of compound rhubarb pill,
ten grains of Castille soap, and five drops of oil of juniper.
These are excellent aperient pills for occasional use in
costiveness, bilious affections, and on all ordinary occasions, and
are suited to the relief of these complaints in children as well as
in adults. One pill taken at bedtime is generally sufficient, but
some persons may require two.</p>

<p><b><a name="R463" id="R463"></a>463.&mdash;Digestive Aperient

</p>

<p>Well rub thirty-six or forty grains of socotrine aloes with
eighteen grains of gum mastic, and add twenty-four grains each of
compound extract of gentian and compound galbanum pill, and a
sufficient quantity of oil of aniseed to make twenty pills. Take
two or three, an hour before dinner, or at night. They are
stomachic and aperient, containing an antispasmodic, and producing
usually a full feculent evacuation. They are very suitable to
persons who have no vital energy to spare, and require a medicine
which will operate mildly, surely, and safely.</p>

<p><b><a name="R464" id="R464"></a>464.&mdash;Worm Powder</b>
</p>

<p>Rub well together two or three grains of calomel and ten grains

the expulsion of worms from children and adults, and may be given
twice a week, or oftener, till the object be accomplished.</p>

<p><b><a name="R465" id="R465"></a>465.&mdash;Infallible Cure for
Tapeworm</b>
</p>

<p>Take of the plant <i>Gisekia pharmaceoides</i>, in its green,
fresh state, leaves, stalks, seeds, and seed-capsules (if the plant
be in seed or forming its seed-vessels) indiscriminately one pound,
and grind it down with sufficient water to render it liquid. It
should be administered to the patient after twelve hours of
fasting, and repeated on the fourth and eighth days. As a
precautionary measure, to destroy any latent germs, repeat the dose
in eight days more. The <i>Gisekia</i> is free of every poisonous
quality: it simply possesses an acrid volatile principle, fatal
alone to the tapeworm, and is in no way distressing to the stomach
or digestive organs. The plant flourishes most luxuriantly in the
jungles at Ferozepore, cis-Sutlej territories, Cawnpore,
Seharunpore, Egypt, Coromandel, the banks of the Irrawaddie, in
Burmah, and throughout Oude. As a specific it was first brought to
European notice by a fakeer at Ferozepore, about the year 1856.</p>

<p><b><a name="R471" id="R471"></a>471.&mdash;Indian Mode of
Preparing Perfumed Oils</b>
</p>

<p>The natives never make use of distillation. The plan adopted is
to place on a large tray a layer of the flowers, about four inches
thick and two feet square; on this they put some of the til or
sesamum seed, wetted or damped, about two inches thick; on this,
again, is placed another layer of flowers, four inches thick; the
whole is then covered with a sheet, held down by weights at the
sides, and allowed to remain for eighteen hours. The flowers are
then removed and replaced by layers of fresh flowers, and the
operation repeated three times, each layer of fresh flowers being
allowed to remain eighteen hours. After the last process, the seeds
are taken in their swollen state and placed in a clean mill; the
oil then expressed possesses most fully the scent of the flowers.
It is kept in prepared skins, called <i>dubbers</i>, and sold at so
much per seer. The jasmine, bela, and chumbr&aelig;l are the
flowers from which the natives chiefly produce the oil.</p>

marrow, which will be the produce of six or eight bones; clear it
thoroughly from bone and fibre, and put it in an earthen vessel of
spring water; change the water every night and morning for eight or
ten days; then steep the marrow in a pint of rose-water for
twenty-four hours, and drain it dry through a linen cloth. Take an
ounce of flowers of benzoin, cyprus-root, odoriferous thorn, and
Florentine iris-root, half an ounce of cinnamon, and a quarter of
an ounce each of cloves and nutmeg. Pound all these very fine, and
mix them well with the marrow; then put all into a pewter digester
which holds three pints, and let the top be closely fitted. Spread
on linen a paste made of flour and white of egg, and fix it over
the top so that there can be no evaporation. Suspend the digester
by the handles in the middle of a pot of boiling water, and keep it
boiling, adding more boiling water as often as necessary. Strain

tablespoonful of spirits of camphor: bottle the mixture for use.
One wineglassful of the solution, with half a pint of tepid water,

should not be burnt, but sliced and roasted, like coffee, to a rich
brown colour, and then pulverised and passed through fine muslin;
the grit should then be repounded and strained through muslin, and
this operation continued until all the powder is finely sifted. The
colour, instead of being black, like charcoal, should be a fine
rich chocolate-colour. The dentifrice may then be used as it is, or
tincture of myrrh and camphor and eau de Cologne may be added to
it.</p>

liable to be softened by heat.</p>

<p><b><a name="R490" id="R490"></a>490.&mdash;Cement for Attaching
Metal to Glass or Porcelain</b>
</p>

<p>Mix two ounces of a thick solution of glue with one ounce of
linseed-oil varnish or three-quarters of an ounce of Venice
turpentine. Boil together, agitating until the mixture becomes as
intimate as possible. The pieces cemented should be fastened
together for forty-eight or sixty hours.</p>

<p><b><a name="R491" id="R491"></a>491.&mdash;Japanese Cement</b>
</p>

<p>This is made by thoroughly mixing rice-flour with cold water,
and then gently boiling it; it is beautifully white, and dries
almost transparent.</p>

<p><b><a name="R492" id="R492"></a>492.&mdash;To Clean Silks,
Satins, Coloured Woollen Dresses, &amp;c.</b>
</p>

<p>Mix well together a quarter of a pound each of soft soap and
honey, the white of an egg, and a wineglassful of gin; the article
should be scoured thoroughly with rather a hard brush, rinsed in
cold water, left to drain, and ironed whilst damp.</p>

<p><b><a name="R493" id="R493"></a>493.&mdash;To Remove Stains from
Mourning Dresses</b>
</p>

<p>Boil a handful of fig-leaves in two quarts of water until
reduced to a pint. Bombazines, crape, cloth, &amp;c., need only be
rubbed with a sponge dipped in this liquor, and the stains will be
instantly removed.</p>

<p><b><a name="R494" id="R494"></a>494.&mdash;To Remove
Ironmould</b>
</p>

<p>Rub the spot with a little powdered oxalic acid, or salts of
lemon, and warm water. Let it remain a few minutes, and then well
rinse it in clear water.</p>

<p><b><a name="R495" id="R495"></a>495.&mdash;To Clean Kid
Gloves</b>
</p>

<p>First see that your hands are clean; then put on the gloves and
wash them, as though you were washing your hands, in a basin of
spirits of turpentine, until quite clean; hang them up in a warm
place, or where there is a good current of air, which will carry
off all smell of the turpentine.</p>

<p><b><a name="R496" id="R496"></a>496.&mdash;To Clean Feathers</b>
</p>

<p>To every gallon of water allow half a pound of quick-lime; stir
the mixture well, and let it stand a night; then pour off the water
that is perfectly clear, put the feathers to be cleaned into a deep
tub, and pour in as much lime-water as will cover them; let them
stand two or three days, stirring them frequently; then put them
into a bag, and wash them thoroughly in cold water; turn them out
on sieves, and wring the water from them by squeezing them in small
portions with the hands, after which they may be separated, the
hard quills picked out, and the down stripped from the large
feathers. When they are thus carefully cleaned, lay them on a floor
where air can be freely admitted; turn and shake them frequently,
and when dry, put them into bags, and beat them on a knocking-stone
with a knocker.</p>

<p><b><a name="R497" id="R497"></a>497.&mdash;To Wash Lace</b>
</p>

<p>Place the lace in folds, and baste it on each side; lay it in
cold water for a night, and wash it in cold water with the best
white soap; gently rub and squeeze it; wash it in three or four
waters with the soap, and rinse it well in clean water; then put it
into thin starch or rice-water; take out the basting thread, and
spread it on a blanket upon a bed to dry; when it is nearly so,
pick it out, and lay it in folds, and when quite dry, lay it in an
old cambric handkerchief, and then in the folds of a towel; put it
upon the rug, or upon a blanket laid upon a stone, and with a heavy
wooden pestle, or rolling-pin, beat it hard till it looks quite
smooth. A scarf or veil, after being starched, should be pinned out
tight upon a cloth on the floor, and when dry, beaten in the same
manner.</p>

<p><b><a name="R498" id="R498"></a>498.&mdash;To Wash Head and
Clothes Brushes</b>
</p>

<p>Put a dessertspoonful of pearl-ashes into a pint of
boiling-water, and shake the brush about in it till it is perfectly
clean; then pour some clean hot water over it; shake, and dry it
before the fire.</p>

<p><b><a name="R499" id="R499"></a>499.&mdash;To Clean Gold Chains,
Earrings, &amp;c.</b>
</p>

<p>Make a lather of soap and water, and boil the chain in it for a
few minutes; immediately on taking it out, lay it in magnesia
powder which has been heated by the fire, and when dry, rub it with
flannel; if embossed, use a brush.</p>

<p><b><a name="R500" id="R500"></a>500.&mdash;To Clean Plate</b>
</p>

<p>Boil an ounce each of cream of tartar, alum, and common salt in
a gallon of water; put the plate in and boil it, and when taken out
and rubbed dry it will have a fine polish. Plate, when laid aside,
will generally tarnish, but if cleaned by this method at stated
periods, it will always look well.</p>

<p><b><a name="R501" id="R501"></a>501.&mdash;To Clean Marble</b>
</p>

<p>Sift through a fine sieve two parts of common soda, one of
pumice-stone, and one of finely-powdered chalk, and mix it with
water; rub it well all over the marble, and the stains will be
removed; then wash the marble with soap and water, and it will be
perfectly clean.</p>

<h3><a name="H32" id="H32"></a>THINGS WORTH KNOWING</h3>

<p><b><a name="R502" id="R502"></a>502.&mdash;To Make Stale Bread
Fresh</b>
</p>

<p>If stale bread be immersed in cold water for a moment or two,
and rebaked for about an hour, it will be for the time in every
respect equal to newly-baked bread; but the deception will be found
out in the course of a few hours.</p>

<p><b><a name="R503" id="R503"></a>503.&mdash;How to Select and
Keep Coffee</b>
</p>

<p>In purchasing coffee, always prefer the Mocha&mdash;a small
roundish berry of a bluish tint. Never buy it roasted; a
coffee-roaster can be procured at a reasonable price, and the
trouble of roasting and grinding it at home is not very great. Let
it be kept in a plain tin canister, and when roasted and ground
transfer it to a smaller air-tight one, as nothing deteriorates
coffee so much as exposure to the light and air after it has been
roasted.</p>

<p><b><a name="R504" id="R504"></a>504.&mdash;Lettuce Salad</b>
</p>

<p>Salads should be very fresh, carefully washed, picked, and dried
in a clean cloth, cut up separately, and put into the bowl only
just before they are required for use. The salad mixture should be
placed at the bottom of the bowl and the salad on top; if mixed,
the leaves lose that crispness which is so delicious. Slices of
beet, eggs, or boiled potatoes are placed on the top to
garnish.</p>

<p><b><a name="R505" id="R505"></a>505.&mdash;Substitute for Cream
in Tea or Coffee</b>
</p>

<p>Beat the white of an egg to a froth, and mix well with it a very
small lump of butter; then add the coffee to it gradually, so that
it may not curdle. If perfectly done, it will be an excellent
substitute for cream.</p>

<p><b><a name="R506" id="R506"></a>506.&mdash;Another Way</b>
</p>

<p>Beat up, separately, the yolk and white of an egg; transfer them
into a large cup, and pour over it sweetened coffee, scalding hot.
Skim away the froth, and fill the coffee into a cup of the required
size.</p>

<p><b><a name="R507" id="R507"></a>507.&mdash;To Protect Bed Linen
and Curtains from Burning</b>
</p>

<p>Add an ounce of alum to the last water in which the linen and
curtains are to be rinsed, and they will be rendered inflammable,
or so slightly combustible that they would take fire very slowly,
if at all. This is a simple precaution, and is recommended where
there are children and in the sick chamber.</p>

<p><b><a name="R508" id="R508"></a>508.&mdash;To Prevent the
Smoking of a Lamp</b>
</p>

<p>Soak the wick in strong vinegar, and dry it well before using
it; it will then burn both sweet and pleasant, and give much
satisfaction for the trifling trouble in preparing it.</p>

<p><b><a name="R509" id="R509"></a>509.&mdash;Transparent Paper</b>
</p>

<p>Paper can be made as transparent as glass, and capable of being
substituted for many purposes, by spreading over it on both sides,
with a feather, a very thin layer of resin dissolved in spirits of
wine. Fine thin post paper is the best for the purpose.</p>

<p><b><a name="R510" id="R510"></a>510.&mdash;To Take Impressions
of Leaves</b>
</p>

<p>A very beautiful and cheap way of taking impressions of leaves
is to take a small quantity of bichromate of potass (say a
teaspoonful), which may be had at any druggist's or colourman's
shop; dissolve it in a saucerful of water, and pass the paper on
which the impressions are to be taken through the solution; while
wet press the leaves lightly upon it, and expose it to the sun,
which should be shining powerfully. When perfectly dry, remove the
leaves, and perfect facsimile will remain in a light lemon shade,
while the rest of the paper will be of a dark brown tint. Bichrome,
as it is generally termed, is in dark yellow crystals, which should
be powdered previous to using it.</p>

<p><b><a name="R511" id="R511"></a>511.&mdash;To Take Impressions
of Leaves on Silk, &amp;c.</b>
</p>

<p>Prepare two rubbers by tying up wool, or any other substance, in
wash-leather; then rub up with cold-drawn linseed oil the
wished-for colours, as indigo for blue, chrome for yellow, &amp;c.;
dip the rubbers into the paint, and rub them one over the other, so
that too much may not remain upon them; place a leaf on one of the
rubbers and damp it with the other; take the leaf off and apply it
to the silk, satin, paper, or other substance you wish stamped;
place a piece of paper on the leaf, and rub it gently, and there
will be a beautiful impression of all the veins. Leaves can only be
used once; they should be nearly all the same size, or the pattern
will not look uniform.</p>
