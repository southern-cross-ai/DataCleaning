  <h2>THE GIRL FROM HOLLYWOOD<br>
  A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</h2>

  <h3>FROM <i>THE SPECTATOR</i>, LONDON, APRIL 5, 1924</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. BURROUGHS, having exhausted the apes and the Martians,
  has now brought his pen to bear on one of the most interesting and sordid
  sections of mere humanity. The interest of Hollywood is natural enough; its
  sordidness, according to accounts, is mainly due to the herding together of
  actors and actresses whose salaries are, for the most part, grotesquely
  disproportionate to their abilities. Mr. Burroughs keeps away from
  personalities, but spares us no detail of the general scene: drug-fiends and
  vampires advance from his pages almost as realistically as, in their
  professional moments, they loom from the screen. A powerful foil is needed
  for these distressing disclosures; the dramatic values and the popular voice
  alike demand one. Mr. Burroughs obliges by importing into the milieu of his
  story a palpably healthy breeze from the adjacent West, an indisputably
  strong man, and an ingénue whose "innocence," though it might captivate
  Tarzan, would certainly seem suspect to Freud. It will be interesting to see
  if "The Girl from Hollywood," which, like its predecessors, has obvious
  merits as a <i>succès de sujet</i>, will come to share their enormous vogue.
  The path is clear, and it would be as unfair as futile to attempt any further
  influence on the popular verdict.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE two horses picked their way carefully downward over the
  loose shale of the steep hillside. The big bay stallion in the lead sidled
  mincingly, tossing his head nervously, and flecking the flannel shirt of his
  rider with foam. Behind the man on the stallion a girl rode a clean-limbed
  bay of lighter color, whose method of descent, while less showy, was safer,
  for he came more slowly, and in the very bad places he braced his four feet
  forward and slid down, sometimes almost sitting upon the ground.</p>

  <p>At the base of the hill there was a narrow level strip; then an eight-foot
  wash, with steep banks, barred the way to the opposite side of the cañon,
  which rose gently to the hills beyond. At the foot of the descent the man
  reined in and waited until the girl was safely down; then he wheeled his
  mount and trotted toward the wash. Twenty feet from it he gave the animal its
  head and a word. The horse broke into a gallop, took off at the edge of the
  wash, and cleared it so effortlessly as almost to give the impression of
  flying.</p>

  <p>Behind the man came the girl, but her horse came at the wash with a
  rush&mdash;not the slow, steady gallop of the stallion&mdash;and at the very
  brink he stopped to gather himself. The dry bank caved beneath his front
  feet, and into the wash he went, head first.</p>

  <p>The man turned and spurred back. The girl looked up from her saddle,
  making a wry face.</p>

  <p>"No damage?" he asked, an expression of concern upon his face.</p>

  <p>"No damage," the girl replied. "Senator is clumsy enough at jumping, but
  no matter what happens he always lights on his feet."</p>

  <p>"Ride down a bit," said the man. "There's an easy way out just below."</p>

  <p>She moved off in the direction he indicated, her horse picking his way
  among the loose boulders in the wash bottom.</p>

  <p>"Mother says he's part cat," she remarked. "I wish he could jump like the
  Apache!"</p>

  <p>The man stroked the glossy neck of his own mount.</p>

  <p>"He never will," he said. "He's afraid. The Apache is absolutely fearless;
  he'd go anywhere I'd ride him. He's been mired with me twice, but he never
  refuses a wet spot; and that's a test, I say, of a horse's courage."</p>

  <p>They had reached a place where the bank was broken down, and the girl's
  horse scrambled from the wash.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's like his rider," suggested the girl, looking at the Apache;
  "brave, but reckless."</p>

  <p>"It was worse than reckless," said the man. "It was asinine. I shouldn't
  have led you over the jump when I know how badly Senator jumps."</p>

  <p>"And you wouldn't have, Custer"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I hadn't been drinking," he finished for her. "I know what you were
  going to say, Grace; but I think you're wrong. I never drink enough to show
  it. No one ever saw me that way&mdash;not so that it was noticeable."</p>

  <p>"It is always noticeable to me and to your mother," she corrected him
  gently. "We always know it, Custer. It shows in little things like what you
  did just now. Oh, it isn't anything, I know, dear; but we who love you wish
  you didn't do it quite so often."</p>

  <p>"It's funny," he said, "but I never cared for it until it became a risky
  thing to get it. Oh, well, what's the use? I'll quit it if you say so. It
  hasn't any hold on me."</p>

  <p>Involuntarily he squared his shoulders&mdash;an unconscious tribute to the
  strength of his weakness.</p>

  <p>Together, their stirrups touching, they rode slowly down the cañon trail
  toward the ranch. Often they rode thus, in the restful silence that is a
  birthright of comradeship. Neither spoke until after they reined in their
  sweating horses beneath the cool shade of the spreading sycamore that guards
  the junction of El Camino Largo and the main trail that winds up Sycamore
  Cañon.</p><a id="pic2"

  </div><br>

  <p>It was the first day of early spring. The rains were over. The California
  hills were green and purple and gold. The new leaves lay softly fresh on the
  gaunt boughs of yesterday. A blue jay scolded from a clump of sumac across
  the trail.</p>

  <p>The girl pointed up into the cloudless sky, where several great birds
  circled majestically, rising and falling upon motionless wings.</p>

  <p>"The vultures are back," she said. "I am always glad to see them come
  again."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the man. "They are bully scavengers, and we don't have to pay
  'em wages."</p>

  <p>The girl smiled up at him.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid my thoughts were more poetic than practical," she said. "I was
  only thinking that the sky looked less lonely now that they have come. Why
  suggest their diet?"</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," he said. "I like them, too. Maligned as they are,
  they are really wonderful birds, and sort of mysterious. Did you ever stop to
  think that you never see a very young one or a dead one? Where do they die?
  Where do they grow to maturity? I wonder what they've found up there! Let's
  ride up. Martin said he saw a new calf up beyond Jack-knife Cañon yesterday.
  That would be just about under where they're circling now."</p>

  <p>They guided their horses around a large, flat slab of rock that some
  camper had contrived into a table beneath the sycamore, and started across
  the trail toward the opposite side of the cañon. They were in the middle of
  the trail when the man drew in and listened.</p>

  <p>"Some one is coming," he said. "Let's wait and see who it is. I haven't
  sent any one back into the hills to-day."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," remarked the girl, "that there is more going on up
  there"&mdash;she nodded toward the mountains stretching to the south of
  them&mdash;"than you know about."</p>

  <p>"How is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So often recently we have heard horsemen passing the ranch late at night.
  If they weren't going to stop at your place, those who rode up the trail must
  have been headed into the high hills; but I'm sure that those whom we heard
  coming down weren't coming from the Rancho del Ganado."</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "not late at night&mdash;or not often, at any rate."</p>

  <p>The footsteps of a cantering horse drew rapidly closer, and presently the
  animal and its rider came into view around a turn in the trail.</p>

  <p>"It's only Allen," said the girl.</p>

  <p>The newcomer reined in at sight of the man and the girl. He was evidently
  surprised, and the girl thought that he seemed ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Just givin' Baldy a work-out," he explained. "He ain't been out for three
  or four days, an' you told me to work 'em out if I had time."</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington nodded.</p>

  <p>"See any stock back there?"</p>

  <p>"No. How's the Apache to-day&mdash;forgin' as bad as usual?"</p>

  <p>Pennington shook his head negatively.</p>

  <p>"That fellow shod him yesterday just the way I want him shod. I wish
  <i>you'd</i> take a good look at his shoes, Slick, so you can see that he's
  always shod this same way."</p>

  <p>His eyes had been traveling over Slick's mount, whose heaving sides were
  covered with lather. "Baldy's pretty soft, Slick; I wouldn't work him too
  hard all at once. Get him up to it gradually."</p>

  <p>He turned and rode off with the girl at his side. Slick Allen looked after
  them for a moment, and then moved his horse off at a slow walk toward the
  ranch. He was a lean, sinewy man, of medium height. He might have been a
  cavalryman once. He sat his horse, even at a walk, like one who has sweated
  and bled under a drill sergeant in the days of his youth.</p>

  <p>"How do you like him?" the girl asked of Pennington.</p>

  <p>"He's a good horseman, and good horsemen are getting rare these days,"
  replied Pennington; "but I don't know that I'd choose him for a playmate.
  Don't you like him?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't His eyes give me the creeps&mdash;they're like a
  fish's."</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth, Grace, I don't like him," said Custer. "He's one of
  those rare birds&mdash;a good horseman who doesn't love horses. I imagine he
  won't last long on the Rancho del Ganado; but we've got to give him a fair
  shake&mdash; he's only been with us a few weeks."</p>

  <p>They were picking their way toward the summit of a steep hogback. The man,
  who led, was seeking carefully for the safest footing, shamed out of his
  recent recklessness by the thought of how close the girl had come to a
  serious accident through his thoughtlessness. They rode along the hogback
  until they could look down into a tiny basin where a small bunch of cattle
  was grazing, and then, turning and dipping over the edge, they dropped slowly
  toward the animals.</p>

  <p>Near the bottom of the slope they came upon a white-faced bull standing
  beneath the spreading shade of a live oak. He turned his woolly face toward
  them, his red-rimmed eyes observing them dispassionately for a moment. Then
  he turned away again and resumed his cud, disdaining further notice of
  them.</p>

  <p>"That's the King of Ganado, isn't it?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Looks like him, doesn't he? But he isn't He's the King's likeliest son,
  and unless I'm mistaken he's going to give the old fellow a mighty tough time
  of it this fall, if the old boy wants to hang on to the grand championship.
  We've never shown him yet. It's an idea of father's. He's always wanted to
  spring a new champion at a great show and surprise the world. He's kept this
  fellow hidden away ever since he gave the first indication that he was going
  to be a fine bull. At least a hundred breeders have visited the herd in the
  past year, and not one of them has seen him. Father says he's the greatest
  bull that ever lived, and that his first show is going to be the
  International."</p>

  <p>"I just know he'll win," exclaimed the girl. "Why look at him! Isn't he a
  beauty?"</p>

  <p>"Got a back like a billiard table," commented Custer proudly.</p>

  <p>They rode down among the heifers. There were a dozen
  beauties&mdash;three-year-olds. Hidden to one side, behind a small bush, the
  man's quick eyes discerned a little bundle of red and white.</p>

  <p>"There it is, Grace," he called, and the two rode toward it</p>

  <p>One of the heifers looked fearfully toward them, then at the bush, and
  finally walked toward it, lowing plaintively.</p>

  <p>"We're not going to hurt it, little girl," the man assured her.</p>

  <p>As they came closer, there arose a thing of long, wobbly legs, big joints,
  and great, dark eyes, its spotless coat of red and white shining with health
  and life.</p>

  <p>"The cunning thing!" cried the girl. "How I'd like to squeeze it! I just
  love 'em, Custer!"</p>

  <p>She had slipped from her saddle, and, dropping her reins on the ground,
  was approaching the calf.</p>

  <p>"Look out for the cow!" cried the man, as he dismounted and moved forward
  to the girl's side, with his arm through the Apache's reins. "She hasn't been
  up much, and she may be a little wild."</p>

  <p>The calf stood its ground for a moment, and then, with tail erect,
  cavorted madly for its mother, behind whom it took refuge.</p>

  <p>"I just love 'em! I just love 'em!" repeated the girl.</p>

  <p>"You say the same thing about the colts and the little pigs," the man
  reminded her.</p>

  <p>"I love 'em all!" she cried, shaking her head, her eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"You love them because they're little and helpless, just like babies," he
  said. "Oh, Grace, how you'd love a baby!"</p>

  <p>The girl flushed prettily. Quite suddenly he seized her in his arms and
  crushed her to him, smothering her with a long kiss. Breathless, she wriggled
  partially away, but he still held her in his arms.</p><a id="pic3"

    <p class="caption">Quite suddenly he seized her in his arms.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Why won't you, Grace?" he begged. "There'll never be anybody else for me
  or for you. Father and mother and Eva love you almost as much as I do, and on
  your side your mother and Guy have always seemed to take it as a matter of
  course that we'd marry. It isn't the drinking, is it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's not that, Custer. Of course I'll marry you&mdash; some day; but
  not yet. Why, I haven't lived yet, Custer! I want to live. I want to do
  something outside of the humdrum life that I have always led and the humdrum
  life that I shall live as a wife and mother. I want to live a little, Custer,
  and then I'll be ready to settle down. You all tell me that I am beautiful,
  and down, away down in the depth of my soul, I feel that I have talent. If I
  have, I ought to use the gifts God has given me."</p>

  <p>She was speaking very seriously, and the man listened patiently and with
  respect, for he realized that she was revealing for the first time a secret
  yearning that she must have long held locked in her bosom.</p>

  <p>"Just what do you want to do, dear?" he asked gently.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;oh, it seems silly when I try to put it in words, but in dreams
  it is very beautiful and very real."</p>

  <p>"The stage?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is just like you to understand!" Her smile rewarded him. "Will you
  help me? I know mother will object."</p>

  <p>"You want me to help you take all the happiness out of my life?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It would only be for a little while&mdash;just a few years, and then I
  would come back to you&mdash;after I had made good."</p>

  <p>"You would never come back, Grace, unless you failed," he said. "If you
  succeeded, you would never be contented in any other life or atmosphere. If
  you came back a failure, you couldn't help but carry a little bitterness
  always in your heart. It would never be the same dear, care-free heart that
  went away so gayly. Here you have a real part to play in a real
  drama&mdash;not make-believe upon a narrow stage with painted drops." He
  flung out a hand in broad gesture. "Look at the setting that God has painted
  here for us to play our parts in&mdash;the parts that He has chosen for us!
  Your mother played upon the same stage, and mine. Do you think them failures?
  And both were beautiful girls&mdash;as beautiful as you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you don't understand, after all, Custer!" she cried. "I thought
  you did."</p>

  <p>"I do understand that for your sake I must do my best to persuade you that
  you have as full a life before you here as upon the stage. I am fighting
  first for your happiness, Grace, and then for mine. If I fail, then I shall
  do all that I can to help you realize your ambition. If you cannot stay
  because you are convinced that you will be happier here, then I do not want
  you to stay."</p>

  <p>"Kiss me," she demanded suddenly. "I am only thinking of it, anyway, so
  let's not worry until there is something to worry about."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE man bent his lips to hers again, and her arms stole
  about his neck. The calf, in the meantime, perhaps disgusted by such
  absurdities, had scampered off to try his brand-new legs again, with the
  result that he ran into a low bush, turned a somersault, and landed on his
  back. The mother, still doubtful of the intentions of the newcomers, to whose
  malevolent presence she may have attributed the accident, voiced a perturbed
  low; whereupon there broke from the vicinity of the live oak a deep note, not
  unlike the rumbling of distant thunder.</p>

  <p>The man looked up.</p>

  <p>"I think we'll be going," he said. "The Emperor has issued an
  ultimatum."</p>

  <p>"Or a bull, perhaps," Grace suggested, as they walked quickly toward her
  horse.</p>

  <p>"Awful!" he commented, as he assisted her into the saddle.</p>

  <p>Then he swung to his own.</p>

  <p>The Emperor moved majestically toward them, his nose close to the ground.
  Occasionally he stopped, pawing the earth and throwing dust upon his broad
  back.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't he look wicked?" cried the girl. "Just look at those eyes!"</p>

  <p>"He's just an old bluffer," replied the man. "However, I'd rather have you
  in the saddle, for you can't always be sure just what they'll do. We must
  call his bluff, though; it would never do to run from him&mdash;might give
  him bad habits."</p>

  <p>He rode toward the advancing animal, breaking into a canter as he drew
  near the bull, and striking his booted leg with a quirt:</p>

  <p>"Hi, there, you old reprobate! Beat it!" he cried.</p>

  <p>The bull stood his ground with lowered head and rumbled threats until the
  horseman was almost upon him; then he turned quickly aside as the rider went
  past.</p>

  <p>"That's better," remarked Custer, as the girl joined him.</p>

  <p>"You're not a bit afraid of him, are you, Custer? You're not afraid of
  anything."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," he demurred. "I learned a long time ago that
  most encounters consist principally of bluff. Maybe I've just grown to be a
  good bluffer. Anyhow, I'm a better bluffer than the Emperor. If the rascal
  had only known it, he could have run me ragged."</p>

  <p>As they rode up the side of the basin, the man's eyes moved constantly
  from point to point, now noting the condition of the pasture grasses, or
  again searching the more distant hills. Presently they alighted upon a thin,
  wavering line of brown, which zigzagged down the opposite side of the basin
  from a clump of heavy brush that partially hid a small ravine, and crossed
  the meadow ahead of them.</p>

  <p>"There's a new trail, Grace, and it don't belong there. Let's go and take
  a look at it."</p>

  <p>They rode ahead until they reached the trail at a point where it crossed
  the bottom of the basin and started up the side they had been ascending. The
  man leaned above his horse's shoulder and examined the trampled turf.</p>

  <p>"Horses," he said. "I thought so, and it's been used a lot this winter.
  You can see even now where the animals slipped and floundered after the heavy
  rains."</p>

  <p>"But you don't run horses in this pasture, do you?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"No; and we haven't run anything in it since last summer. This is the only
  bunch in it, and they were just turned in about a week ago. Anyway, the
  horses that made this trail were mostly shod. Now what in the world is
  anybody going up there for?" His eyes wandered to the heavy brush into which
  the trail disappeared upon the opposite side of the basin. "I'll have to
  follow that up to-morrow&mdash;it's too late to do it to-day."</p>

  <p>"We can follow it the other way, toward the ranch," she suggested.</p>

  <p>They found the trail wound up the hillside and crossed the hogback in
  heavy brush, which, in many places, had been cut away to allow the easier
  passage of a horseman.</p>

  <p>"Do you see," asked Custer, as they drew rein at the summit of the ridge,
  "that although the trail crosses here in plain sight of the ranch house, the
  brush would absolutely conceal a horseman from the view of any one at the
  house? It must run right down into Jackknife Cañon. Funny none of us have
  noticed it, for there's scarcely a week that that trail isn't ridden by some
  of us!"</p>

  <p>As they descended into the cañon, they discovered why that end of the new
  trail had not been noticed. It ran deep and well marked through the heavy
  brush of a gully to a place where the brush commenced to thin, and there it
  branched into a dozen dim trails that joined and blended with the old, well
  worn cattle paths of the hillside.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's mighty foxy," observed the man; "but I don't see what it's all
  about. The days of cattle runners and bandits are over."</p>

  <p>"Just imagine!" exclaimed the girl. "A real mystery in our lazy, old
  hills!"</p>

  <p>The man rode in silence and in thought. A herd of pure- bred Herefords,
  whose value would have ransomed half the crowned heads remaining in Europe,
  grazed in the several pastures that ran far back into those hills; and back
  there somewhere that trail led, but for what purpose? No good purpose, he was
  sure, or it had not been so cleverly hidden.</p>

  <p>As they came to the trail which they called the Camino Corto, where it
  commenced at the gate leading from the old goat corral, the man jerked his
  thumb toward the west along it.</p>

  <p>"They must come and go this way," he said.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they're the ones mother and I have heard passing at night,"
  suggested the girl. "If they are, they come right through your property,
  below the house&mdash;not this way."</p>

  <p>He opened the gate from the saddle and they passed through, crossing the
  <i>barranco</i>, and stopping for a moment to look at the pigs and talk with
  the herdsman. Then they rode on toward the ranch house, a half mile farther
  down the widening cañon. It stood upon the summit of a low hill, the
  declining sun transforming its plastered walls, its cupolas, the sturdy
  arches of its arcades, into the semblance of a Moorish castle.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the hill they dismounted at the saddle- horse stable, tied
  their horses, and ascended the long flight of rough concrete steps toward the
  house. As they rounded the wild sumac bush at the summit, they were espied by
  those sitting in the patio, around three sides of which the house was
  built.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here they are now!" exclaimed Mrs. Pennington. "We were so afraid
  that Grace would ride right on home, Custer. We had just persuaded Mrs. Evans
  to stay for dinner. Guy is coming, too."</p>

  <p>"Mother, you here, too?" cried the girl. "How nice and cool it is in here!
  It would save a lot of trouble if we brought our things, mother."</p>

  <p>"We are hoping that at least one of you will, very soon," said Colonel
  Pennington, who had risen, and now put an arm affectionately about the girl's
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's what I've been telling her again this afternoon," said Custer;
  "but instead she wants to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl turned toward him with a little frown and shake of her head.</p>

  <p>"You'd better run down and tell Allen that we won't use the horses until
  after dinner," she said.</p>

  <p>He grimaced good-naturedly and turned away.</p>

  <p>"I'll have him take Senator home," he said. "I can drive you and your
  mother down in the car, when you leave."</p>

  <p>As he descended the steps that wound among the umbrella trees, taking on
  their new foliage, he saw Allen examining the Apache's shoes. As he neared
  them, the horse pulled away from the man, his suddenly lowered hoof striking
  Allen's instep. With an oath the fellow stepped back and swung a vicious kick
  to the animal's belly. Almost simultaneously a hand fell heavily upon his
  shoulder. He was jerked roughly back, whirled about, and sent spinning a
  dozen feet away, where he stumbled and fell. As he scrambled to his feet,
  white with rage, he saw the younger Pennington before him.</p>

  <p>"Go to the office and get your time," ordered Pennington.</p>

  <p>"I'll get you first, you son of a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A hard fist connecting suddenly with his chin put a painful period to his
  sentence before it was completed, and stopped his mad rush.</p>

  <p>"I'd be more careful of my conversation, Allen, if I were you," said
  Pennington quietly. "Just because you've been drinking is no excuse for
  <i>that</i>. Now go on up to the office, as I told you to."</p>

  <p>He had caught the odor of whisky as he jerked the man past him.</p>

  <p>"You goin' to can me for drinkin'&mdash;<i>you!</i>" demanded Allen.</p>

  <p>"You know what I'm canning you for. You know that's the one thing that
  don't go on Ganado. You ought to get what you gave the Apache, and you'd
  better beat it before I lose my temper and give it to you!"</p>

  <p>The man rose slowly to his feet. In his mind he was revolving his chances
  of successfully renewing his attack; but presently his judgment got the
  better of his desire and his rage. He moved off slowly up the hill toward the
  house. A few yards, and he turned.</p>

  <p>"I ain't a goin' to ferget this, you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Pennington admonished.</p>

  <p>"Nor you ain't goin' to ferget it, neither, you fox- trottin' dude!"</p>

  <p>Allen turned again to the ascent of the steps. Pennington walked to the
  Apache and stroked his muzzle.</p>

  <p>"Old boy," he crooned, "there don't anybody kick you and get away with it,
  does there?"</p>

  <p>Halfway up, Allen stopped and turned again.</p>

  <p>"You think you're the whole cheese, you Penningtons, don't you?" he called
  back. "With all your money an' your fine friends! Fine friends, yah! I can
  put one of 'em where he belongs any time I want&mdash;the darn bootlegger!
  That's what he is. You wait&mdash;you'll see!"</p>

  <p>"A-ah, beat it!" sighed Pennington wearily.</p>

  <p>Mounting the Apache, he led Grace's horse along the foot of the hill
  toward the smaller ranch house of their neighbor, some half mile away.
  Humming a little tune, he unsaddled Senator, turned him into his corral, saw
  that there was water in his trough, and emptied a measure of oats into his
  manger, for the horse had cooled off since the afternoon ride. As neither of
  the Evans ranch hands appeared, he found a piece of rag and wiped off the
  Senator's bit, turned the saddle blankets wet side up to dry, and then,
  leaving the stable, crossed the yard to mount the Apache.</p>

  <p>A young man in riding clothes appeared simultaneously from the interior of
  the bungalow, which stood a hundred feet away. Crossing the wide porch, he
  called to Pennington.</p>

  <p>"Hello there, Penn! What you doing?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Just brought Senator in&mdash;Grace is up at the house. You're coming up
  there, too, Guy."</p>

  <p>"Sure, but come in here a second. I've got something to show you."</p>

  <p>Pennington crossed the yard and entered the house behind Grace's brother,
  who conducted him to his bedroom. Here young Evans unlocked a closet, and,
  after rummaging behind some clothing, emerged with a bottle, the shape and
  dimensions of which were once as familiar in the land of the free as the
  benign countenance of Lydia E. Pinkham.</p>

  <p>"It's the genuine stuff, Penn, too!" he declared. Pennington smiled.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, old fellow, but I've quit," he said.</p>

  <p>"Quit!" exclaimed Evans.</p>

  <p>"Yep."</p>

  <p>"But think of it, man&mdash;aged eight years in the wood, and bottled in
  bond before July I, 1919. The real thing, and as cheap as
  moonshine&mdash;only six beans a quart. Can you believe it?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," admitted Pennington. "Your conversation listens phony."</p>

  <p>"But it's the truth. You may have quit, but one little snifter of this
  won't hurt you. Here's this bottle already open&mdash;just try it"; and he
  proffered the bottle and a glass to the other.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's pretty hard to resist anything that sounds as good as this
  does," remarked Pennington. "I guess one won't hurt me any." He poured
  himself a drink and took it. "Wonderful!" he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Evans, diving into the closet once more. "I got you a bottle,
  too, and we can get more."</p>

  <p>Pennington took the bottle and examined it, almost caressingly.</p>

  <p>"Eight years in the wood!" he murmured. "I've got to take it, Guy. Must
  have something to hand down to posterity-" He drew a bill fold from his
  pocket and counted out six dollars.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Guy. "You'll never regret it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the two young men climbed the hill to the big house, a
  few minutes later, they found the elder Pennington standing at the edge of
  the driveway that circled the hill-top, looking out toward the wide cañon and
  the distant mountains. In the nearer foreground lay the stable and corrals of
  the saddle-horses, the hen-house with its two long alfalfa runways, and the
  small dairy-barn accommodating the little herd of Guernseys that supplied
  milk, cream, and butter for the ranch. A quarter of a mile beyond, among the
  trees, was the red-roofed "cabin" where the unmarried ranch hands ate and
  slept, near the main corrals with their barns, outhouses, and sheds.</p>

  <p>In a hilly pasture farther up the cañon the black and iron gray of
  Percheron brood mares contrasted with the greening hillsides of spring. Still
  farther away, the white and red of the lordly figure of the Emperor stood out
  boldly upon the summit of the ridge behind Jackknife Cañon.</p>

  <p>The two young men joined the older, and Custer put an arm affectionately
  about his father's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You never tire of it," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking at it for twenty-two years, my son," replied the
  elder Pennington, "and each year it has become more wonderful to me. It never
  changes, and yet it is never twice alike. See the purple sage away off there,
  and the lighter spaces of wild buckwheat, and here and there among the scrub
  oak the beautiful pale green of the manzanita&mdash; scintillant jewels in
  the diadem of the hills! And the faint haze of the mountains that seem to
  throw them just a little out of focus, to make them a perfect background for
  the beautiful hills which the Supreme Artist is placing on his canvas to-day.
  An hour from now He will paint another masterpiece, and to-night another, and
  forever others, with never two alike, nor ever one that mortal man can
  duplicate; and all for us, boy, all for us, if we nave the hearts and the
  souls to see!"</p>

  <p>"How you love it!" said the boy.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and your mother loves it; and it is our great happiness that you and
  Eva love it, too."</p>

  <p>The boy made no reply. He did love it; but his was the heart of youth, and
  it yearned for change and for adventure and for what lay beyond the circling
  hills and the broad, untroubled valley that spread its level fields below
  "the castle on the hill."</p>

  <p>"The girls are dressing for a swim," said the older man, after a moment of
  silence. "Aren't you boys going in?"</p>

  <p>"The girls" included his wife and Mrs. Evans, as well as Grace, for the
  colonel insisted that youth was purely a physical and mental attribute,
  independent of time. If one could feel and act in accord with the spirit of
  youth, one could not be old.</p>

  <p>"Are you going in?" asked his son.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was waiting for you two."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll be excused, sir," said Guy. "The water is too cold yet. I
  tried it yesterday, and nearly froze to death. I'll come and watch."</p>

  <p>The two Penningtons moved off toward the house, to get into swimming
  things, while young Evans wandered down into the water gardens. As he stood
  there, idly content in the quiet beauty of the spot, Allen came down the
  steps, his check in his hand. At sight of the boy he halted behind him, an
  unpleasant expression upon his face.</p>

  <p>Evans, suddenly aware that he was not alone, turned and recognized the
  man. "Oh, hello, Allen!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Young Pennington just canned me," said Allen, with no other return of
  Evans's greeting.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"You may be sorrier!" growled Allen, continuing on his way toward the
  cabin to get his blankets and clothes.</p>

  <p>For a moment Guy stared after the man, a puzzled expression knitting his
  brows. Then he slowly flushed, glancing quickly about to see if anyone had
  overheard the brief conversation between Slick Allen and himself.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he entered the enclosure west of the house, where the
  swimming-pool lay. Mrs. Pennington and her guests were already in the pool,
  swimming vigorously to keep warm, and a moment later the colonel and Custer
  ran from the house and dived in simultaneously. Though there was twenty- six
  years' difference in their ages, it was not evidenced by any lesser vitality
  or agility on the part of the older man.</p>

  <p>Colonel Custer Pennington had been born in Virginia fifty years before.
  Graduated from the Virginia Military Institute and West Point, he had taken a
  commission in the cavalry branch of the service. Campaigning in Cuba, he had
  been shot through one lung, and shortly after the close of the war he was
  retired for disability, with rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1900 he had come
  to California, on the advice of his physician in the forlorn hope that he
  might prolong his sufferings a few years more.</p>

  <p>For two hundred years the Penningtons had bred fine men, women, and horses
  upon the same soil in the State whose very existence was inextricably
  interwoven with their own. A Pennington leave Virginia? Horrors! Perish the
  thought! But Colonel Custer Pennington had had to leave it or die, and with a
  young wife and a two-year-old boy he couldn't afford to die. Deep in his
  heart he meant to recover his health in distant California and then return to
  the land of his love; but his physician had told a mutual friend, who was
  also Pennington's attorney, that "poor old Cus" would almost undoubtedly be
  dead inside of a year.</p>

  <p>And so Pennington had come West with Mrs. Pennington and little Custer,
  Jr., and had found the Rancho del Ganado run down, untenanted, and for sale.
  A month of loafing had left him almost ready to die of stagnation, without
  any assistance from his poor lungs; and when, in the course of a drive to
  another ranch, he had happened to see the place, and had learned that it was
  for sale, the germ had been sown.</p>

  <p>He judged from the soil and the water that Ganado was not well suited to
  raise the type of horse that he knew best, and that he and his father and his
  grandfathers before them had bred in Virginia; but he saw other
  possibilities. Moreover, he loved the hills and the cañons from the first;
  and so he had purchased the ranch, more to have something that would
  temporarily occupy his mind until his period of exile was ended by a return
  to his native State, or by death, than with any idea that it would prove a
  permanent home.</p>

  <p>The old Spanish-American house had been remodeled and rebuilt. In four
  years he had found that Herefords, Berkshires, and Percherons may win a place
  in a man's heart almost equal to that which a thoroughbred occupies. Then a
  little daughter had come, and the final seal that stamps a man's house as his
  home was placed upon "the castle on the hill."</p>

  <p>His lung had healed&mdash;he could not tell by any sign it gave that it
  was not as good as ever&mdash;and still ne stayed on in the land of sunshine,
  which he had grown to love without realizing its hold upon him. Gradually he
  had forgotten to say "when we go back home"; and when at last a letter came
  from a younger brother, saying that he wished to buy the old place in
  Virginia if the Custer Penningtons did not expect to return to it, the
  colonel was compelled to face the issue squarely.</p>

  <p>They had held a little family council&mdash;the colonel and Julia, his
  wife, with seven-year-old Custer and little one- year-old Eva. Eva, sitting
  in her mother's lap, agreed with everyone. Custer, Jr., burst into tears at
  the very suggestion of leaving dear old Ganado.</p>

  <p>"And what do you think about it, Julia?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I love Virginia, dear," she had replied; "but I think I love California
  even more, and I say it without disloyalty to my own State. It's a different
  kind of love."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," said her husband. "Virginia is a mother to us,
  California a sweetheart."</p>

  <p>And so they stayed upon the Rancho del Ganado.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WORK and play were inextricably entangled upon Ganado, the
  play being of a nature that fitted men better for their work, while the work,
  always in the open and usually from the saddle, they enjoyed fully as much as
  the play. While the tired businessman of the city was expending a day's
  vitality and nervous energy in an effort to escape from the turmoil of the
  mad rush-hour and find a strap from which to dangle homeward amid the toxic
  effluvia of the melting pot, Colonel Pennington plunged and swam in the cold,
  invigorating waters of his pool, after a day of labor fully as constructive
  and profitable as theirs.</p>

  <p>"One more dive!" he called, balancing upon the end of the springboard,
  "and then I'm going out. Eva ought to be here by the time we're dressed,
  hadn't she? I'm about famished."</p>

  <p>"I haven't heard the train whistle yet, though it must be due," replied
  Mrs. Pennington. "You and Boy make so much noise swimming that we'll miss
  Gabriel's trump if we happen to be in the pool at the time!"</p>

  <p>The colonel, Custer, and Grace Evans dived simultaneously, and, coming up
  together, raced for the shallow end, where Mrs. Evans and her hostess were
  preparing to leave the pool. The girl, reaching the hand rail first, arose
  laughing and triumphant.</p>

  <p>"My foot slipped as I dived," cried the younger Pennington, wiping the
  water from his eyes, "or I'd have caught you!"</p>

  <p>"No alibis, Boy!" laughed the colonel. "Grace beat you fair and
  square."</p>

  <p>"Race you back for a dollar, Grace!" challenged the young man.</p>

  <p>"You're on," she cried. "One, two, three&mdash;go!"</p>

  <p>They were off. The colonel, who had preceded them leisurely into the deep
  water, swam close to his son as the latter was passing, a yard in the lead.
  Simultaneously the young man's progress ceased. With a Comanche-like yell he
  turned upon his father, and the two men grappled and went down. When they
  came up, spluttering and laughing, the girl was climbing out of the pool.</p>

  <p>"You win, Grace!" shouted the colonel.</p>

  <p>"It's a frame-up!" cried Custer. "He grabbed me by the ankle!"</p>

  <p>"Well, who had a better right?" demanded the girl. "He's referee."</p>

  <p>"He's a fine mess for a referee!" grumbled Custer good- naturedly.</p>

  <p>"Run along and get your dollar, and pay up like a gentleman," admonished
  his father.</p>

  <p>"What do you get out of it? What do you pay him, Grace?"</p>

  <p>They were still bantering as they entered the house and sought their
  several rooms to dress.</p>

  <p>Guy Evans strolled from the walled garden of the swimming pool to the open
  arch that broke the long pergola beneath which the driveway ran along the
  north side of the house. Here he had an unobstructed view of the broad valley
  stretching away to the mountains in the distance.</p>

  <p>Down the center of the valley a toy train moved noiselessly. As he watched
  it, he saw a puff of white rise from the tiny engine. It rose and melted in
  the evening air before the thin, clear sound of the whistle reached his ears.
  The train crawled behind the green of trees and disappeared.</p>

  <p>He knew that it had stopped at the station, and that a slender, girlish
  figure was alighting, with a smile for the porter and a gay word for the
  conductor who had carried her back and forth for years upon her occasional
  visits to the city a hundred miles away. Now the chauffeur was taking her bag
  and carrying it to the roadster that she would drive home along the wide,
  straight boulevard that crossed the valley&mdash;utterly ruining a number of
  perfectly good speed laws.</p>

  <p>Two minutes elapsed, and the train crawled out from behind the trees and
  continued its way up the valley&mdash;a little black caterpillar with spots
  of yellow twinkling along its sides. As twilight deepened, the lights from
  ranch houses and villages sprinkled the floor of the valley. Like jewels
  scattered from a careless hand, they fell singly and in little clusters; and
  then the stars, serenely superior, came forth to assure the glory of a
  perfect California night.</p>

  <p>The headlights of a motor car turned in at the driveway. Guy went to the
  east porch and looked in at the living room door, where some of the family
  had already collected.</p>

  <p>"Eva's coming!" he announced.</p>

  <p>She had been gone since the day before, but she might have been returning
  from a long trip abroad, if every one's eagerness to greet her was any
  criterion. Unlike city dwellers, these people had never learned to conceal
  the lovelier emotions of their hearts behind a mask of assumed indifference.
  Perhaps the fact that they were not forever crowded shoulder to shoulder with
  strangers permitted them an enjoyable naturalness which the dweller in the
  wholesale districts of humanity can never know; for what a man may reveal of
  his heart among friends he hides from the unsympathetic eyes of others,
  though it may be the noblest of his possessions. With a rush the car topped
  the hill, swung up the driveway, and stopped at the corner of the house. A
  door flew open, and the girl leaped from the driver's seat.</p>

  <p>"Hello, everybody!" she cried.</p>

  <p>Snatching a kiss from her brother as she passed him, she fairly leaped
  upon her mother, hugging, kissing, laughing, dancing, and talking all at
  once. Espying her father, she relinquished a disheveled and laughing mother
  and dived for him.</p>

  <p>"Most adorable pops!" she cried, as he caught her in his arms. "Are you
  glad to have your little nuisance back? I'll bet you're not. Do you love me?
  You won't when you know how much I've spent, but oh, popsy, I had <i>such</i>
  a good time! That's all there was to it, and oh, momsie, who, who, <i>who</i>
  do you suppose I met? Oh, you'd never guess&mdash; never, never!"</p>

  <p>"Whom did you meet?" asked her mother.</p>

  <p>"Yes, little one, <i>whom</i> did you meet?" inquired her brother.</p>

  <p>"And he's perfectly <i>gorgeous</i>," continued the girl, as if there had
  been no interruption; "and I danced with him&mdash;oh, such <i>divine</i>
  dancing! Oh, Guy Evans! Why how do you do? I never saw you."</p>

  <p>The young man nodded glumly.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Eva?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Evans is here, too, dear," her mother reminded her.</p>

  <p>The girl curtsied before her mother's guest, and then threw her arm about
  the older woman's neck.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Aunt Mae!" she cried. "I'm <i>so</i> excited; but you should have
  <i>seen</i> him, and, momsie, I got the <i>cutest</i> riding hat!" They were
  moving toward the living room door, which Guy was holding open. "Guy, I got
  you the splendiferousest Christmas present!"</p>

  <p>"Help!" cried her brother, collapsing into a porch chair. "Don't you know
  that I have a weak heart? Do your Christmas shopping early&mdash;do it in
  April! Oh, Lord, can you beat it?" he demanded of the others. "Can you beat
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I think it was mighty nice of Eva to remember me at all," said Guy,
  thawing perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Custer. "I'll bet you got him a pipe."</p>

  <p>"How ever in the world did you guess?" demanded Eva.</p>

  <p>Custer rocked from side to side in his chair, laughing. "What are you
  laughing at? Idiot!" cried the girl. "How did you guess I got him a
  pipe?"</p>

  <p>"Because he never smokes anything but cigarettes."</p>

  <p>"You're horrid!"</p>

  <p>He pulled her down onto his lap and kissed her. "Dear little one!" he
  cried. Taking her head between his hands, he shook it. "Hear 'em rattle!"</p>

  <p>"But I love a pipe," stated Guy emphatically. "The trouble is, I never had
  a really nice one before."</p>

  <p>"There!" exclaimed the girl triumphantly. "And you know <i>Sherlock
  Holmes</i> always smoked a pipe."</p>

  <p>Her brother knitted his brows.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite connect," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you need a diagram, isn't Guy an author?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Not so that any one could notice it&mdash;yet," demurred Evans.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're going to be!" said the girl proudly.</p>

  <p>"The light is commencing to dawn," announced her brother. "<i>Sherlock
  Holmes</i>, the famous author, who wrote Conan Doyle!"</p>

  <p>A blank expression overspread the girl's face, to be presently expunged by
  a slow smile.</p>

  <p>"You are perfectly horrid!" she cried. "I'm going in to dapper up a bit
  for dinner&mdash;don't wait."</p>

  <p>She danced through the living room and out into the patio toward her own
  rooms.</p>

  <p>"Rattle, rattle, little brain; rattle, rattle round again," her brother
  called after her. "Can you beat her?" he added, to the others.</p>

  <p>"She can't even be approximated," laughed the colonel. "In all the world
  there is only one of her."</p>

  <p>"And she's ours, bless her!" said the brother. The colonel was glancing
  over the headlines of an afternoon paper that Eva had brought from the
  city.</p>

  <p>"What's new?" asked Custer.</p>

  <p>"Same old rot," replied his father. "Murders, divorces, kidnappers,
  bootleggers, and they haven't even the originality to make them interesting
  by evolving new methods. Oh, hold on&mdash;this isn't so bad!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">"'Two hundred thousand dollars' worth of stolen whisky
  landed on coast,'" he read. "'Prohibition enforcement agents, together with
  special agents from the Treasury Department, are working on a unique theory
  that may reveal the whereabouts of the fortune in bonded whisky stolen from a
  government warehouse in New York a year ago. All that was known until
  recently was that the whisky was removed from the warehouse in trucks in
  broad daylight, compassing one of the boldest robberies ever committed in New
  York. Now, from a source which they refuse to divulge, the government sleuths
  have received information which leads them to believe that the liquid loot
  was loaded aboard a sailing vessel, and after a long trip around the Horn, is
  lying somewhere off the coast of southern California. That it is being
  lightered ashore in launches and transported to some hiding place in the
  mountains is one theory upon which the government is working. The whisky is
  eleven years old, was bottled in bond three years ago, just before the
  Eighteenth Amendment became a harrowing reality. It will go hard with the
  traffickers in this particular parcel of wet goods if they are apprehended,
  since the theft was directly from a government bonded warehouse, and all
  government officials concerned in the search are anxious to make an example
  of the guilty parties.'"</p><br>

  <p class="first">"Eleven years old!" sighed the colonel. "It makes my mouth
  water! I've been subsisting on home-made grape wine for over a year. Think of
  it&mdash;a Pennington! Why, my ancestors must be writhing in their Virginia
  graves!"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, they're probably laughing in their sleeves. They died
  before July 1, 1919," interposed Custer. "Eleven years old&mdash;eight years
  in the wood," he mused aloud, shooting a quick glance in the direction of Guy
  Evans, who suddenly became deeply interested in a novel lying on a table
  beside his chair, notwithstanding the fact that he had read it six months
  before and hadn't liked it. "And it will go hard with the traffickers, too,"
  continued young Pennington. "Well, I should hope it would. They'll probably
  hang 'em, the vile miscreants!"</p>

  <p>Guy had risen and walked to the doorway opening upon the patio.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what is keeping Eva," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Getting hungry?" asked Mrs. Pennington. "Well, I guess we all are.
  Suppose we don't wait any longer? Eva won't mind."</p>

  <p>"If I wait much longer," observed the colonel, "some one will have to
  carry me into the dining room."</p>

  <p>As they crossed the library toward the dining room the two young men
  walked behind their elders.</p>

  <p>"Is your appetite still good?" inquired Custer.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" retorted Evans. "You give me a pain."</p><br>

  <p class="first">They had finished their soup before Eva joined them, and
  after the men were re-seated they took up the conversation where it had been
  interrupted. As usual, if not always brilliant, it was at least diversified,
  for it included many subjects from grand opera to the budding of English
  walnuts on the native wild stock, and from the latest novel to the most
  practical method of earmarking pigs. Paintings, poems, plays, pictures,
  people, horses, and home-brew&mdash;each came in for a share of the
  discussion, argument, and raillery that ran round the table.</p>

  <p>During a brief moment when she was not engaged in conversation, Guy seized
  the opportunity to whisper to Eva, who sat next to him.</p>

  <p>"Who was that bird you met in L.A.?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Which one?"</p>

  <p>"Which one! How many did you meet?"</p>

  <p>"Oodles of them."</p>

  <p>"I mean the one you were ranting about."</p>

  <p>"Which one was I ranting about? I don't remember."</p>

  <p>"You're enough to drive anybody to drink, Eva Pennington!" cried the young
  man disgustedly.</p>

  <p>"Radiant man!" she cooed. "What's the dapper little idea in that talented
  brain&mdash;jealous?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know who he is," demanded Guy.</p>

  <p>"Who who is?"</p>

  <p>"You know perfectly well who I mean&mdash;the poor fish you were raving
  about before dinner. You said you danced with him. Who is he? That's what I
  want to know."</p>

  <p>"I don't like the way you talk to me; but if you must know, he was the
  most dazzling thing you ever saw. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I never saw him, and I don't want to, and I don't care how dazzling he
  is. I only want to know his name."</p>

  <p>"Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? His name's Wilson Crumb."
  Her tone was as of one who says: "Behold Alexander the Great!"</p>

  <p>"Wilson Crumb! Who's he?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to sit there and tell me that you don't know who Wilson Crumb
  is, Guy Evans?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Never heard of him," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"Never heard of Wilson Crumb, the famous actor-director? Such
  ignorance!"</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of him before this trip to L.A.?" inquired her brother
  from across the table. "I never heard you mention him before."</p>

  <p>"Well, maybe I didn't," admitted the girl; "but he's the most dazzling
  dancer you ever saw&mdash;and such eyes! And maybe he'll come out to the
  ranch and bring his company. He said they were often looking for just such
  locations."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you invited him?" demanded Custer accusingly.</p>

  <p>"And why not? I had to be polite, didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"You know perfectly well that father has never permitted such a thing,"
  insisted her brother, looking toward the colonel for support.</p>

  <p>"He didn't ask father&mdash;he asked me," returned the girl.</p>

  <p>"You see," said the colonel, "how simply Eva solves every little
  problem."</p>

  <p>"But you know, popsy, how perfectly superb it would be to have them take
  some pictures right here on our very own ranch, where we could watch them all
  day long.</p>

  <p>"Yes," growled Custer; "watch them wreck the furniture and demolish the
  lawns! Why, one bird of a director ran a troop of cavalry over one of the
  finest lawns in Hollywood. Then they'll go up in the hills and chase the
  cattle over the top into the ocean. I've heard all about them. I'd never
  allow one of 'em on the place."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they're not all inconsiderate and careless," suggested Mrs.
  Pennington.</p>

  <p>"You remember there was a company took a few scenes at my place a year or
  so ago," interjected Mrs. Evans. "They were very nice indeed."</p>

  <p>"They were just wonderful," said Grace Evans. "I hope the colonel lets
  them come. It would be piles of fun!"</p>

  <p>"You can't tell anything about them," volunteered Guy. "I understand they
  pick up all sorts of riffraff for extra people&mdash;I.W.W.'s* and all sorts
  of people like that. I'd be afraid."</p>

  <p>He shook his head dubiously.</p>

  <p>*FOOTNOTE</p>

  <p>* [I.W.W.&mdash;Industrial Workers of the World. A former international
  labor union and radical labor movement in the United States; founded in
  Chicago in 1905 and dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.
  &mdash;R-G.]</p><br>

  <p class="first">"The trouble with you two is," asserted Eva, "that you're
  afraid to let us girls see any nice-looking actors from the city. That's
  what's the matter with you!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they're jealous," agreed Mrs. Pennington, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Custer, "if there are leading men there are leading ladies,
  and from what I've seen of them the leading ladies are better-looking than
  the leading men. By all means, now that I consider the matter, let them come.
  Invite them at once, for a month&mdash;wire them!"</p>

  <p>"Silly!" cried his sister. "He may not come here at all. He just mentioned
  it casually."</p>

  <p>"And all this tempest in a teapot for nothing," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>Wilson Crumb was forthwith dropped from the conversation and forgotten by
  all, even by impressionable little Eva.</p>

  <p>As the young people gathered around Mrs. Pennington at the piano in the
  living room, Mrs. Evans and Colonel Pennington sat apart, carrying on a
  desultory conversation while they listened to the singing.</p>

  <p>"We have a new neighbor," remarked Mrs. Evans, "on the ten-acre orchard
  adjoining us on the west."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Mrs. Burke. She has moved in, has she?" inquired the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday. She is a widow from the East&mdash;has a daughter in Los
  Angeles, I believe."</p>

  <p>"She came to see me about a month ago," said the colonel, "to ask my
  advice about the purchase of the property. She seemed rather a refined, quiet
  little body. I must tell Julia&mdash;she will want to call on her."</p>

  <p>"I insisted on her taking dinner with us last night," said Mrs. Evans.
  "She seems very frail, and was all worn out. Unpacking and settling is trying
  enough for a robust person, and she seems so delicate that I really don't see
  how she stood it all."</p>

  <p>Then the conversation drifted to other topics until the party at the piano
  broke up and Eva came dancing over to her father.</p>

  <p>"Gorgeous popsy!" she cried, seizing him by an arm. "Just one dance before
  bedtime&mdash;if you love me, just one!"</p>

  <p>Colonel Pennington rose from his chair, laughing.</p>

  <p>"I know your one dance, you little fraud&mdash;five foxtrots, three
  one-steps, and a waltz."</p>

  <p>With his arms about each other they started for the ballroom&mdash;really
  a big play-room, which adjoined the garage. Behind them, laughing and
  talking, came the two older women, the two sons, and Grace Evans. They would
  dance for an hour and then go to bed, for they rose early and were in the
  saddle before sunrise, living their happy, care-free life far from the strife
  and squalor of the big cities, and yet with more of the comforts and luxuries
  than most city dwellers ever achieve.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE bungalow at 1421 Vista del Paso was of the new school of
  Hollywood architecture, which appears to be a hysterical effort to combine
  Queen Anne, Italian, Swiss chalet, Moorish, Mission, and Martian. Its plaster
  walls were of a yellowish rose, the outside woodwork being done in light
  blue, while the windows were shaded with striped awnings of olive and pink.
  On one side of the entrance rose a green pergola&mdash;the ambitious atrocity
  that marks the meeting place of landscape gardening and architecture, and
  that outrages them both. Culture has found a virus for the cast iron dogs,
  deer, and rabbits that ramped in immobility upon the lawns of yesteryear, but
  the green pergola is an incurable disease.</p>

  <p>Connecting with the front of the house, a plaster wall continued across
  the narrow lot to the property line at one side and from there back to the
  alley, partially inclosing a patio&mdash;which is Hollywood for back-yard. An
  arched gateway opened into the patio from the front. The gate was of rough
  redwood boards, and near the top there were three auger holes arranged in the
  form of a triangle&mdash;this was art. Upon the yellow-rose plaster above the
  arch a design of three monkeys was stenciled in purple&mdash;this also was
  art.</p>

  <p>As you wait in the three-foot-square vestibule you notice that the floor
  is paved with red brick set in black mortar, and that the Oregon pine door,
  with its mahogany stain, would have been beautiful in its severe simplicity
  but for the little square of plate glass set in the upper right hand corner,
  demonstrating conclusively the daring originality of the artist
  architect.</p>

  <p>Presently your ring is answered, and the door is opened by a Japanese
  "schoolboy" of thirty-five in a white coat. You are ushered directly into a
  living room, whereupon you forget all about architects and art, for the room
  is really beautiful, even though a trifle heavy in an Oriental way, with its
  Chinese rugs, dark hangings, and ponderous, overstuffed furniture. The
  Japanese schoolboy, who knows you, closes the door behind you and then
  tiptoes silently from the room.</p>

  <p>Across from you, on a divan, a woman is lying, her face buried among
  pillows. When you cough, she raises her face toward you, and you see that it
  is very beautiful, even though the eyes are a bit wide and staring and the
  expression somewhat haggard. You see a mass of black hair surrounding a face
  of perfect contour. Even the plucked and penciled brows, the rouged cheeks,
  and carmined lips cannot hide a certain dignity and sweetness.</p>

  <p>At sight of you she rises, a bit unsteadily, and, smiling with her lips,
  extends a slender hand in greeting. The fingers of the hand tremble and are
  stained with nicotine. Her eyes do not smile&mdash;ever.</p>

  <p>"The same as usual?" she asks in a weary voice.</p>

  <p>Your throat is very dry. You swallow before you assure her eagerly, almost
  feverishly, that her surmise is correct. She leaves the room. Probably you
  have not noticed that she is wild-eyed and haggard, or that her fingers are
  stained and trembling, for you, too, are wild-eyed and haggard, and you are
  trembling worse than she.</p>

  <p>Presently she returns. In her left hand is a small glass phial, containing
  many little tablets. As she crosses to you, she extends her right hand with
  the palm up. It is a slender, delicate hand, yet there is a look of strength
  to it, for all its whiteness. You lay a bill in it, and she hands you the
  phial. That is all. You leave, and she closes the Oregon pine door quietly
  behind you.</p>

  <p>As she turns about toward the divan again, she hesitates. Her eyes wander
  to a closed door at one side of the room. She takes a half step toward it,
  and then draws back, her shoulders against the door. Her fingers are clenched
  tightly, the nails sinking into the soft flesh of her palms; but still her
  eyes are upon the closed door. They are staring and wild, like those of a
  beast at bay. She is trembling from head to foot.</p>

  <p>For a minute she stands there, fighting her grim battle, alone and without
  help. Then, as with a last mighty effort, she drags her eyes from the closed
  door and glances toward the divan. With unsteady step she returns to it and
  throws herself down among the pillows.</p>

  <p>Her shoulders move to dry sobs, she clutches the pillows frantically in
  her strong fingers, she rolls from side to side, as people do who are
  suffering physical torture; but at last she relaxes and lies quiet.</p>

  <p>A clock ticks monotonously from the mantel. Its sound fills the whole
  room, growing with fiendish intensity to a horrid din that pounds upon taut,
  raw nerves. She covers her ears with her palms to shut it out, but it bores
  insistently through. She clutches her thick hair with both hands; her fingers
  are entangled in it. For a long minute she lies thus, prone, and then her
  slippered feet commence to fly up and down as she kicks her toes in rapid
  succession into the unresisting divan.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she leaps to her feet and rushes toward the mantel.</p>

  <p>"Damn you!" she screams, and, seizing the clock, dashes it to pieces upon
  the tiled hearth.</p>

  <p>Then her eyes leap to the closed door; and now, without any hesitation,
  almost defiantly, she crosses the room, opens the door, and disappears within
  the bathroom beyond.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the door opens again, and the woman comes back into the
  living room. She is humming a gay little tune. Stopping at a table, she takes
  a cigarette from a carved wooden box and lights it. Then she crosses to the
  baby grand piano in one corner, and commences to play. Her voice, rich and
  melodious, rises in a sweet old song of love and youth and happiness.</p>

  <p>Something had mended her shattered nerves. Upon the hearth lies the
  shattered clock. It can never be mended.</p>

  <p>If you should return now and look at her, you would see that she was even
  more beautiful than you had at first suspected. She has put her hair in order
  once more, and has arranged her dress. You see now that her figure is as
  perfect as her face, and when she crossed to the piano you could not but note
  the easy grace of her carriage.</p>

  <p>Her name&mdash;her professional name&mdash;is Gaza de Lure. You may have
  seen her in small parts on the screen, and may have wondered why some one did
  not star her. Of recent months you have seen her less and less often, and you
  have been sorry, for you had learned to admire the sweetness and purity that
  were reflected in her every expression and mannerism. You liked her, too,
  because she was as beautiful as she was good&mdash;for you knew that she was
  good just by looking at her in the pictures; but above all you liked her for
  her acting, for it was unusually natural and unaffected, and something told
  you that here was a born actress who would some day be famous.</p>

  <p>Two years ago she came to Hollywood from a little town in the Middle
  West&mdash;that is, two years before you looked in upon her at the bungalow
  on the Vista del Paso. She was fired by high purpose then. Her child's heart,
  burning with lofty ambition, had set its desire upon a noble goal. The broken
  bodies of a thousand other children dotted the road to the same goal, but she
  did not see them, or seeing, did not understand.</p>

  <p>Stronger, perhaps, than her desire for fame was an unselfish ambition that
  centered about the mother whom she had left behind. To that mother the girl's
  success would mean greater comfort and happiness than she had known since a
  worthless husband had deserted her shortly after the baby came&mdash;the baby
  who was now known as Gaza de Lure.</p>

  <p>There had been the usual rounds of the studios, the usual disappointments,
  followed by more or less regular work as an extra girl. During this period
  she had learned many things&mdash; of some of which she had never thought as
  having any possible bearing upon her chances for success.</p>

  <p>For example, a director had asked her to go with him to Vernon one
  evening, for dinner and dancing, and she had refused, for several
  reasons&mdash;one being her certainty that her mother would disapprove, and
  another the fact that the director was a married man. The following day the
  girl who had accompanied him was cast for a part which had been promised to
  Gaza, and for which Gaza was peculiarly suited. As she was leaving the lot
  that day, greatly disappointed, the assistant director had stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Too bad, kid," he said. "I'm mighty sorry; for I always liked you. If I
  can ever help you, I sure will."</p>

  <p>The kindly words brought the tears to her eyes. Here, at least, was one
  good man; but he was not in much of a position to help her.</p>

  <p>"You're very kind," she said; "but I'm afraid there's nothing you can
  do."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure of that," he answered. "I've got enough on that big
  stiff so's he has to do about as I say. The trouble with you is you ain't
  enough of a good fellow. You got to be a good fellow to get on in pictures.
  Just step out with me some night, an' I promise you you'll get a job!"</p>

  <p>The suddenly widening childish eyes meant nothing to the shallow mind of
  the callow little shrimp, whose brain pan would doubtless have burst under
  the pressure of a single noble thought. As she turned quickly and walked
  away, he laughed aloud. She had not gone back to that studio.</p>

  <p>In the months that followed she had had many similar experiences, until
  she had become hardened enough to feel the sense of shame and insult less
  strongly than at first.</p>

  <p>She could talk back to them now, and tell them what she thought of them;
  but she found that she got fewer and fewer engagements. There was always
  enough to feed and clothe her, and to pay for the little room she rented; but
  there seemed to be no future, and that had been all that she cared about.</p>

  <p>She would not have minded hard work&mdash;she had expected that. Nor did
  she fear disappointments and a slow, tedious road; for though she was but a
  young girl, she was not without character, and she had a good head cm those
  trim shoulders of hers. She was unsophisticated, yet mature, too, for her
  years; for she had always helped her mother to plan the conservation of their
  meager resources.</p>

  <p>Many times she had wanted to go back to her mother, but she had stayed on,
  because she still had hopes, and because she shrank from the fact of defeat
  admitted. How often she cried herself to sleep in those lonely nights, after
  days of bitter disillusionment! The great ambition that had been her joy was
  now her sorrow. The vain little conceit that she had woven about her screen
  name was but a pathetic memory.</p>

  <p>She had never told her mother that she had taken the name of Gaza de Lure,
  for she had dreamed of the time when it would leap into national prominence
  overnight in some wonderful picture, and her mother, unknowing, would see the
  film and recognize her. How often she had pictured the scene in their little
  theater at home&mdash;her sudden recognition by her mother and their
  friends&mdash;the surprise, the incredulity, and then the pride and happiness
  in her mother's face! How they would whisper! And after the show they would
  gather around her mother, all excitedly talking at the same time.</p>

  <p>And then she had met Wilson Crumb. She had had a small part in a picture
  in which he played lead, and which he also directed. He had been very kind to
  her, very courteous. She had thought him handsome, notwithstanding a certain
  weakness in his face; but what had attracted her most was the uniform
  courtesy of his attitude toward all the women of the company. Here at last,
  she thought, she had found a real gentleman whom she could trust implicitly;
  and once again her ambition lifted its drooping head.</p>

  <p>She thought of what another girl had once told her&mdash;an older girl,
  who had been in pictures for several years.</p>

  <p>"They are not all bad, dear," her friend had said. "There are good and bad
  in the picture game, just as there are in any sort of business. It's been
  your rotten luck to run up against a lot of the bad ones."</p>

  <p>The first picture finished, Crumb had cast her for a more important part
  in another, and she had made good in both. Before the second picture was
  completed, the company that employed Crumb offered her a five-year contract.
  It was only for fifty dollars a week; but it included a clause which
  automatically increased the salary to one hundred a week, two hundred and
  fifty, and then five hundred dollars in the event that they starred her. She
  knew that it was to Crumb that she owed the contract&mdash;Crumb had seen to
  that.</p>

  <p>Very gradually, then&mdash;so gradually and insidiously that the girl
  could never recall just when it had started&mdash;Crumb commenced to make
  love to her. At first it took only the form of minor attentions&mdash;little
  courtesies and thoughtful acts; but after a while he spoke of love&mdash;very
  gently and very tenderly, as any man might have done.</p>

  <p>She had never thought of loving him or any other man; so she was puzzled
  at first, but she was not offended. He had given her no cause for offense.
  When he had first broached the subject, she had asked him not to speak of it,
  as she did not think that she loved him, and he had said that he would wait;
  but the seed was planted in her mind, and it came to occupy much of her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>She realized that she owed to him what little success she had achieved.
  She had an assured income that was sufficient for her simple wants, while
  permitting her to send something home to her mother every week, and it was
  all due to the kindness of Wilson Crumb. He was a successful director, he was
  more than a fair actor, he was good-looking, he was kind, he was a gentleman,
  and he loved her. What more could any girl ask?</p>

  <p>She thought the matter out very carefully, finally deciding that though
  she did not exactly love Wilson Crumb she probably would learn to love him,
  and that if he loved her it was in a way her duty to make him happy, when he
  had done so much for her happiness. She made up her mind, therefore, to marry
  him whenever he asked her; but Crumb did not ask her to marry him. He
  continued to make love to her; but the matter of marriage never seemed to
  enter the conversation.</p>

  <p>Once, when they were out on location, and had had a hard day, ending by
  getting thoroughly soaked in a sudden rain, he had followed her to her room
  in the little mountain inn where they were stopping.</p>

  <p>"You're cold and wet and tired," he said. "I want to give you something
  that will brace you up."</p>

  <p>He entered the room and closed the door behind him. Then he took from his
  pocket a small piece of paper folded into a package about an inch and
  three-quarters long by half an inch wide, with one end tucked ingeniously
  inside the fold to form a fastening. Opening it, he revealed a white powder,
  the minute crystals of which glistened beneath the light from the electric
  bulbs.</p>

  <p>"It looks just like snow," she said.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he replied, with a faint smile. "It is snow. Look, I'll show you
  how to take it."</p>

  <p>He divided the powder into halves, took one in the palm of his hand, and
  snuffed it into his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"There!" he exclaimed. "That's the way&mdash;it will make you feel like a
  new woman."</p>

  <p>"But what is it?" she asked. "Won't it hurt me?"</p>

  <p>"It'll make you feel bully. Try it."</p>

  <p>So she tried it, and it made her "feel bully." She was no longer tired,
  but deliriously exhilarated.</p>

  <p>"Whenever you want any, let me know," he said, as he was leaving the room.
  "I usually have some handy."</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to know what it is," she insisted.</p>

  <p>"Aspirin," he replied. "It makes you feel that way when you snuff it up
  your nose."</p>

  <p>After he left, she recovered the little piece of paper from the waste
  basket where he had thrown it, her curiosity aroused. She found it a rather
  soiled bit of writing paper with a "C" written in lead pencil upon it.</p>

  <p>"'C,'" she mused. "Why aspirin with a C?"</p>

  <p>She thought she would question Wilson about it.</p>

  <p>The next day she felt out of sorts and tired, and at noon she asked him if
  he had any aspirin with him. He had, and again she felt fine and full of
  life. That evening she wanted some more, and Crumb gave it to her. The next
  day she wanted it oftener, and by the time they returned to Hollywood from
  location she was taking it five or six times a day. It was then that Crumb
  asked her to come and live with him at his Vista del Paso bungalow; but he
  did not mention marriage.</p>

  <p>He was standing with a little paper of the white powder in his hand,
  separating half of it for her, and she was waiting impatiently for it.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, what?"</p>

  <p>"Are you coming over to live with me?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Without being married?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She was surprised that the idea no longer seemed horrible. Her eyes and
  her mind were on the little white powder that the man held in his hand.</p>

  <p>Crumb laughed.</p>

  <p>"Quit your kidding," he said. "You know perfectly well that I can't marry
  you yet. I have a wife in San Francisco."</p>

  <p>She did not know it perfectly well&mdash;she did not know it at all; yet
  it did not seem to matter so very much. A month ago she would have caressed a
  rattlesnake as willingly as she would have permitted a married man to make
  love to her; but now she could listen to a plea from one who wished her to
  come and live with him, without experiencing any numbing sense of outraged
  decency.</p>

  <p>Of course, she had no intention of doing what he asked; but really the
  matter was of negligible import&mdash;the thing in which she was most
  concerned was the little white powder. She held out her hand for it, but he
  drew it away.</p>

  <p>"Answer me first," he said. "Are you going to be sensible or not?"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you won't give it to me if I won't come?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I mean," he replied. "What do you think I am,
  anyway? Do you know what this bundle of 'C' stands me? Two fifty, and you've
  been snuffing about three of 'em a day. What kind of a sucker do you think I
  am?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes, still upon the white powder, narrowed.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," she whispered. "Give it to me!"</p>

  <p>She went to the bungalow with him that day, and she learned where he kept
  the little white powders, hidden in the bathroom. After dinner she put on her
  hat and her fur, and took up her vanity case, while Crumb was busy in another
  room. Then, opening the front door, she called:</p>

  <p>"Good-by!"</p>

  <p>Crumb rushed into the living room. "Where are you going?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Home," she replied.</p>

  <p>"No, you're not!" he cried. "You promised to stay here."</p>

  <p>"I promised to come," she corrected him. "I never promised to stay, and I
  never shall until you are divorced and we are married."</p>

  <p>"You'll come back," he sneered, "when you want another shot of snow!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," she replied. "I guess I can buy aspirin at any drug
  store as well as you."</p>

  <p>Crumb laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"You little fool, you!" he cried derisively. "Aspirin! Why, it's cocaine
  you're snuffing, and you're snuffing about three grains of it a day!"</p>

  <p>For an instant a look of horror filled her widened eyes.</p>

  <p>"You beast!" she cried. "You unspeakable beast!"</p>

  <p>Slamming the door behind her, she almost ran down the narrow walk and
  disappeared in the shadows of the palm trees that bordered the ill-lighted
  street.</p>

  <p>The man did not follow her. He only stood there laughing, for he knew that
  she would come back. Craftily he had enmeshed her. It had taken months, and
  never had quarry been more wary or difficult to trap. A single false step
  earlier in the game would have frightened her away forever; but he had made
  no false step. He was very proud of himself, was Wilson Crumb, for he was
  convinced that he had done a very clever bit of work.</p>

  <p>Rubbing his hands together, he walked toward the bathroom&mdash;he would
  take a shot of snow; but when he opened the receptacle, he found it
  empty.</p>

  <p>"The little devil!" he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>Frantically he rummaged through the medicine cabinet, but in vain. Then he
  hastened into the living room, seized his hat, and bolted for the street.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately he realized the futility of search. He did not know
  where the girl lived. She had never told him. He did not know it, but she had
  never told any one. The studio had a post-office box number to which it could
  address communications to Gaza de Lure; the mother addressed the girl by her
  own name at the house where she had roomed since coming to Hollywood. The
  woman who rented her the room did not know her screen name. All she knew
  about her was that she seemed a quiet, refined girl who paid her room rent
  promptly in advance every week, and who was always home at night, except when
  on location.</p>

  <p>Crumb returned to the bungalow, searched the bath room twice more, and
  went to bed. For hours he lay awake, tossing restlessly.</p>

  <p>"The little devil!" he muttered, over and over. "Fifty dollars' worth of
  cocaine&mdash;the little devil!"</p>

  <p>The next day Gaza was at the studio, ready for work, when Crumb put in his
  belated appearance. He was nervous and irritable. Almost immediately he
  called her aside and demanded an accounting; but when they were face to face,
  and she told him that she was through with him, he realized that her hold
  upon him was stronger than he had supposed. He could not give her up. He was
  ready to promise anything, and he would demand nothing in return, only that
  she would be with him as much as possible. Her nights should be her
  own&mdash; she could go home then. And so the arrangement was consummated,
  and Gaza de Lure spent the days when she was not working at the bungalow on
  the Vista del Paso.</p>

  <p>Crumb saw that she was cast for small parts that required but little of
  her time at the studio, yet raised no question at the office as to her salary
  of fifty dollars a week. Twice the girl asked why he did not star her, and
  both times he told her that he would&mdash;for a price; but the price was one
  that she would not pay. After a time the drugs which she now used habitually
  deadened her ambition, so that she no longer cared. She still managed to send
  a little money home, but not so much as formerly.</p>

  <p>As the months passed, Crumb's relations with the source of the supply of
  their narcotic became so familiar that he could obtain considerable
  quantities at a reduced rate, and the plan of peddling the drug occurred to
  him.</p>

  <p>Gaza was induced to do her share, and so it came about that the better
  class "hypes" of Hollywood found it both safe and easy to obtain their
  supplies from the bungalow on the Vista del Paso. Cocaine, heroin, and
  morphine passed continually through the girl's hands, and she came to know
  many of the addicts, though she seldom had further intercourse with them than
  was necessary to the transaction of the business that brought them to the
  bungalow.</p>

  <p>From one, a woman, she learned how to use morphine, dissolving the white
  powder in the bowl of a spoon by passing a lighted match beneath, and then
  drawing the liquid through a tiny piece of cotton into a hypodermic syringe
  and injecting it beneath the skin. Once she had experienced the sensation of
  well-being it induced, she fell an easy victim to this more potent drug.</p>

  <p>One evening Crumb brought home with him a stranger whom he had known in
  San Francisco&mdash;a man whom he introduced as Allen. From that evening the
  fortunes of Gaza de Lure improved. Allen had just returned from the Orient as
  a member of the crew of a freighter, and he had succeeded in smuggling in a
  considerable quantity of opium. In his efforts to dispose of it he had made
  the acquaintance of others in the same line of business, and had joined
  forces with them. His partners could command a more or less steady supply of
  morphine, and cocaine from Mexico, while Allen undertook to keep up their
  stock of opium, and to arrange a market for their drugs in Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>If Crumb could handle it all, Allen agreed to furnish morphine at fifty
  dollars an ounce&mdash;Gaza to do the actual peddling. The girl agreed on one
  condition&mdash;that half the profits should be hers. After that she had been
  able to send home more money than ever before, and at the same time to have
  all the morphine she wanted at a low price. She began to put money in the
  bank, made a first payment on a small orchard about a hundred miles from Los
  Angeles, and sent for her mother.</p>

  <p>The day before you called on her in the "art" bungalow at 1421 Vista del
  Paso she had put her mother on a train bound for her new home, with the
  promise that the daughter would visit her "as soon as we finish this
  picture." It had required all the girl's remaining will power to hide her
  shame from those eager mother eyes; but she had managed to do it, though it
  had left her almost a wreck by the time the train pulled out of the
  station.</p>

  <p>To Crumb she had said nothing about her mother. This was a part of her
  life that was too sacred to be revealed to the man whom she now loathed even
  as she loathed the filthy habit he had tricked her into; but she could no
  more give up the one than the other.</p>

  <p>There had been a time when she had fought against the domination of these
  twin curses that had been visited upon her, but that time was over. She knew
  now that she would never give up morphine&mdash;that she could not if she
  wanted to, and that she did not want to. The little bindles of cocaine,
  morphine, and heroin that she wrapped so deftly with those slender fingers
  and marked "C," "M," or "H," according to their contents, were parts of her
  life now. The sallow, trembling creatures who came for them, or to whom she
  sometimes delivered them, and who paid her two dollars and a half a bindle,
  were also parts of her life. Crumb, too, was a part of her life. She hated
  the bindles, she hated the sallow, trembling people, she hated Crumb; but
  still she clung to them, for how else was she to get the drug without which
  she could not live?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was May. The rainy season was definitely over. A few
  April showers had concluded it. The Ganado hills showed their most brilliant
  greens. The March pigs were almost ready to wean. White-faced calves and
  black colts and gray colts surveyed this beautiful world through soft, dark
  eyes, and were filled with the joy of living as they ran beside their gentle
  mothers. A stallion neighed from the stable corral, and from the ridge behind
  Jackknife Cañon the Emperor of Ganado answered him.</p>

  <p>A girl and a man sat in the soft grass beneath the shade of a live-oak
  upon the edge of a low bluff in the pasture where the brood mares grazed with
  their colts. Their horses were tied to another tree near by. The girl held a
  bunch of yellow violets in her hand, and gazed dreamily down the broad cañon
  toward the valley. The man sat a little behind her and gazed at the girl. For
  a long time neither spoke.</p>

  <p>"You cannot be persuaded to give it up, Grace?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I should never be happy until I had tried it," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "I know how you feel about it. I feel the same way.
  I want to get away&mdash;away from the deadly stagnation and sameness of this
  life; but I am going to try to stick it out for father's sake, and I wish
  that you loved me enough to stick it out for mine. I believe that together we
  could get enough happiness out of life here to make up for what we are denied
  of real living, such as only a big city can offer. Then, when father is gone,
  we could go and live in the city&mdash;in any city that we wanted to live
  in&mdash;Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, London, Paris&mdash;anywhere."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that I don't love you enough, Custer," said the girl. "I love
  you too much to want you to marry just a little farmer girl. When I come to
  you, I want you to be proud of me. Don't talk about the time when your father
  will have gone. It seems wicked. He would not want you to stay if he knew how
  you felt about it."</p>

  <p>"You do not know," he replied. "Ever since I was a little boy he has
  counted on this&mdash;on my staying on and working with him. He wants us all
  to be together always. When Eva marries, he will build her a home on Ganado.
  You have already helped with the plan for ours. You know it is his dream, but
  you cannot know how much it means to him. It would not kill him if his dream
  was spoiled, but it would take so much happiness out of his life that I
  cannot bring myself to do it. It is not a matter of money, but of sentiment
  and love. If Ganado were wiped off the face of the earth to-morrow, we would
  still have all the money that we need; but he would never be happy again, for
  his whole life is bound up in the ranch and the dream that he has built
  around it. It is peculiar, too, that such a man as he should be so ruled by
  sentiment. You know how practical he is, and sometimes hard&mdash;yet I have
  seen the tears come to his eyes when he spoke of his love for Ganado."</p>

  <p>"I know," she said, and they were silent again for a time. "You are a good
  son, Custer," she said presently. "I wouldn't have you any different. I am
  not so good a daughter. Mother does not want me to go. It is going to make
  her very unhappy, and yet I am going. The man who loves me does not want me
  to go. It is going to make him very unhappy, and yet I am going. It seems
  very selfish; but, oh, Custer, I cannot help but feel that I am right! It
  seems to me that I have a duty to perform, and that this is the only way I
  can perform it. Perhaps I am not only silly, but sometimes I feel that I am
  called by a higher power to give myself for a little time to the world, that
  the world may be happier and, I hope, a little better. You know I have always
  felt that the stage was one of the greatest powers for good in all the world,
  and now I believe that some day the screen will be an even greater power for
  good. It is with the conviction that I may help toward this end that I am so
  eager to go. You will be very glad and very happy when I come back, that I
  did not listen to your arguments."</p>

  <p>"I hope you are right, Grace," Custer Pennington said.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>On a rustic seat beneath the new leaves of an umbrella tree a girl and a
  boy sat beside the upper lily pond on the south side of the hill below the
  ranch house. The girl held a spray of Japanese quince blossoms in her hand,
  and gazed dreamily at the water splashing lazily over the rocks into the
  pond. The boy sat beside her and gazed at the girl. For a long time neither
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Won't you please say yes?" whispered the boy presently.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly, terribly silly you are!" she replied.</p>

  <p>"I am not silly," he said. "I am twenty, and you are almost eighteen. It's
  time that we were marrying and settling down."</p>

  <p>"On what?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, we won't need much at first. We can live at home with mother," he
  explained, "until I sell a few stories."</p>

  <p>"How perfectly gorgeristic!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Don't make fun of me! You wouldn't if you loved me," he pouted.</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> love you, silly! But whatever in the world put the dapper
  little idea into your head that I wanted to be supported by my
  mother-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"Mother-in-law!" protested the boy. "You ought to be ashamed to speak
  disrespectfully of my mother."</p>

  <p>"You quaint child!" exclaimed the girl, laughing gayly. "Just as if I
  would speak disrespectfully of Aunt Mae, when I love her so splendiferously!
  Isn't she going to be my mother-in-law?"</p>

  <p>The boy's gloom vanished magically.</p>

  <p>"There!" he cried. "We're engaged! You've said it yourself. You've
  proposed, and I accept you. Yes, sure&mdash; she's going to be your
  mother-in-law!"</p>

  <p>Eva flushed.</p>

  <p>"I never said anything of the kind. How perfectly idiotical!"</p>

  <p>"But you did say it. You proposed to me. I'm going to announce the
  engagement&mdash;'Mrs. Mae Evans announces the engagement of her son, Guy
  Thackeray, to Miss Eva Pennington.'"</p>

  <p>"Funeral notice later," snapped the girl, glaring at him.</p>

  <p>"Aw, come, now, you needn't get mad at me. I was only fooling; but
  wouldn't it be great, Ev? We could always be together then, and I could write
  and you could&mdash; could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wash dishes," she suggested.</p>

  <p>The light died from his eyes, and he dropped them sadly to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I'm poor," he said. "I didn't think you cared about that,
  though."</p>

  <p>She laid a brown hand gently over his.</p>

  <p>"You know I don't care," she said. "I am a catty old thing. I'd just love
  it if we had a little place all our very own&mdash;just a teeny, weeny
  bungalow. I'd help you with your work, and keep hens, and have a little
  garden with onions and radishes and everything, and we wouldn't have to buy
  anything from the grocery store, and a bank account, and one sow; and when we
  drove into the city people would say, 'There goes Guy Thackeray Evans, the
  famous author, but I wonder where his wife got that hat!'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ev!" he cried laughing. "You never can be serious more than two
  seconds, can you?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I be?" she inquired. "And anyway, I was. It really would be
  elegantiferous if we had a little place of our own; but my husband has got to
  be able to support me, Guy. He'd lose his self-respect if he didn't; and
  then, if he lost his, how could I respect him? You've got to have respect on
  both sides, or you can't have love and happiness."</p>

  <p>His face grew stern with determination.</p>

  <p>"I'll get the money," he said; but he did not look at her. "But now that
  Grace is going away, mother will be all alone if I leave, too. Couldn't we
  live with her for a while?"</p>

  <p>"Papa and mama have always said that it was the worst thing a young
  married couple could do," she replied. "We could live near her, and see her
  every day; but I don't think we should all live together. Really, though, do
  you think Grace is going? It seems just too awful."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid she is," he replied sadly. "Mother is all broken up about it;
  but she tries not to let Grace know."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," said the girl. "It seems to me a selfish thing to
  do, and yet Grace has always been so sweet and generous. No matter how much I
  wanted to go, I don't believe I could bring myself to do it, knowing how
  terribly it would hurt papa. Just think, Guy&mdash;it is the first break,
  except for the short time we were away at school, since we have been born. We
  have all lived here always, it seems, your family and mine, like one big
  family; but after Grace goes it will be the beginning of the end. It will
  never be the same again."</p>

  <p>There was a note of seriousness and sadness in her voice that sounded not
  at all like Eva Pennington. The boy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is too bad," he said; "but Grace is so sure she is right&mdash;so
  positive that she has a great future before her, and that we shall all be so
  proud of her&mdash;that sometimes I am convinced myself."</p>

  <p>"I hope she is right," said the girl, and then, with a return to her
  joyous self: "Oh, wouldn't it be spiffy if she really does become famous! I
  can see just now puffed up we shall all be when we read the reviews of her
  pictures, like this&mdash;'Miss Grace Evans, the famous star, has quite
  outdone her past successes in the latest picture, in which she is ably
  supported by such well known actors as Thomas Meighan, Wallace Reid, Gloria
  Swanson, and Mary Pickford.'"</p>

  <p>"Why slight Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin?" suggested Guy.</p>

  <p>The girl rose.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" she said. "Let's have a look at the pools&mdash;it isn't a
  perfect day unless I've seen fish in every pool. Do you remember how we used
  to watch and watch and watch for the fish in the lower pools, and run as fast
  as we could to be the first up to the house to tell if we saw them, and how
  many?"</p>

  <p>"And do you remember the little turtles, and how wild they got?" he put
  in. "Sometimes we wouldn't see them for weeks, and then we'd get just a
  glimpse, so that we knew they were still there. Then, after a while, we never
  saw them again, and how we used to wonder and speculate as to what had become
  of them!"</p>

  <p>"And do you remember the big water snake we found in the upper pool, and
  how Cus used to lie in wait for him with his little twenty-two?"</p>

  <p>"Cus was always the hunter. How we used to trudge after him up and down
  those steep hills there in the cow pasture, while he hunted ground squirrels,
  and how mad he'd get if we made any noise! Gee, Ev, those were the good old
  days!"</p>

  <p>"And how we used to fight, and what a nuisance Cus thought me; but he
  always asked me to go along, just the same. He's a wonderful brother,
  Guy!"</p>

  <p>"He's a wonderful man, Ev," replied the boy. "You don't half know how
  wonderful he is. He's always thinking of some one else. Right now I'll bet
  he's eating his heart out because Grace is going away; and he can't go, just
  because he's thinking more of some one's else happiness than his own."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He wants to go to the city. He wants to get into some business there; but
  he won't go, because he knows your father wants him here."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that?"</p>

  <p>"I know it," he said.</p>

  <p>They walked on in silence along the winding pathways among the
  flower-bordered pools, to stop at last beside the lower one. This had
  originally been a shallow wading pool for the children when they were small,
  but it was now given over to water hyacinth and brilliant fan-tails.</p>

  <p>"There!" said the girl, presently. "I have seen fish in each pool."</p>

  <p>"And you can go to bed with a clear conscience tonight," he laughed.</p>

  <p>To the west of the lower pool there were no trees to obstruct their view
  of the hills that rolled down from the mountains to form the western wall of
  the cañon in which the ranch buildings and cultivated fields lay. As the two
  stood there, hand in hand, the boy's eyes wandered lovingly over the soft,
  undulating lines of these lower hills, with their parklike beauty of
  greensward dotted with wild walnut trees. As he looked he saw, for a brief
  moment, the figure of a man on horseback passing over the hollow of a saddle
  before disappearing upon the southern side.</p>

  <p>Small though the distant figure was, and visible but for a moment, the boy
  recognized the military carriage of the rider. He glanced quickly at the girl
  to note if she had seen, but it was evident that she had not.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ev," he said, "I guess I'll be toddling."</p>

  <p>"So early?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"You see I've got to get busy, if I'm going to get the price of that
  teeny, weeny bungalow," he explained. "Now that we're engaged, you might kiss
  me good-by&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"We're not engaged, and I'll not kiss you good-by or good anything else. I
  don't believe in people kissing until they're married."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you always raving about the wonderful kisses Antonio Moreno,
  or Milton Sills, or some other poor prune, gives the heroine at the end of
  the last reel?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's different," she explained. "Anyway, they're just going to get
  married. When we are just going to get married I'll let you kiss
  me&mdash;once a week, <i>maybe!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" he cried.</p>

  <p>A moment later he swung into the saddle, and with a wave of his hand
  cantered off up the cañon.</p>

  <p>"Now what," said the girl to herself, "is he going up there for? He can't
  make any money back there in the hills. He ought to be headed straight for
  home and his typewriter!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ACROSS the rustic bridge, and once behind the sycamores at
  the lower end of the cow pasture, Guy Evans let his horse out into a rapid
  gallop. A few minutes later he overtook a horseman who was moving at a slow
  walk farther up the cañon. At the sound of the pounding hoof-beats behind
  him, the latter turned in his saddle, reined about and stopped. The boy rode
  up and drew in his blowing mount beside the other.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Allen!" he said.</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"What's eatin' you?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking over that proposition of yours," explained Evans.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've been thinking maybe I might swing it; but are you sure it's
  safe. How do I know you won't double-cross me?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know," replied the other. "All you know is that I got enough on
  you to send you to San Quentin. You wouldn't get nothing' worse if you
  handled the rest of it, an' you stand to clean up between twelve and fifteen
  thousand bucks on the deal. You needn't worry about me double-crossin' you.
  What good would it do me? I ain't got nothin' against you, kid. If you don't
  double-cross me I won't double-cross you; but look out for that cracker-fed
  dude your sister's goin' to hitch to. If he ever butts in on this I'll croak
  him an' send you to San Quentin, if I swing for it. Do you get me?"</p>

  <p>Evans nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in on it," he said, "because I need the money; but don't you
  bother Custer Pennington&mdash;get that straight. I'd go to San Quentin and
  I'd swing myself before I'd stand for that. Another thing, and then well drop
  that line of chatter&mdash;you couldn't send me to San Quentin or anywhere
  else. I bought a few bottles of hootch from you, and there isn't any judge or
  jury going to send me to San Quentin for that."</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you done," said Allen, with a grin. "There's a
  thousand cases of bonded whisky hid back there in the hills, an' you
  engineered the whole deal at this end. Maybe you didn't have nothin' to do
  with stealin' it from a government bonded warehouse in New York; but you must
  'a' knowed all about it, an' it was you that hired me and the other three to
  smuggle it off the ship and into the hills."</p>

  <p>Evans was staring at the man in wide-eyed incredulity.</p>

  <p>"How do you get that way?" he asked derisively.</p>

  <p>"They's four of us to swear to it," said Allen; "an' how many you got to
  swear you didn't do it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's a rotten frame-up!" exclaimed Evans.</p>

  <p>"Sure it's a frame-up," agreed Allen; "but we won't use it if you behave
  yourself properly."</p>

  <p>Evans looked at the man for a long minute&mdash;dislike and contempt
  unconcealed upon his face.</p>

  <p>"I guess," he said presently, "that I don't need any twelve thousand
  dollars that bad, Allen. We'll call this thing off, as far as I am concerned.
  I'm through, right now. Good-by!"</p>

  <p>He wheeled his horse to ride away.</p>

  <p>"Hold on there, young feller!" said Allen. "Not so quick! You may think
  you're through, but you're not. We need you, and, anyway, you know too damned
  much for your health. You're goin' through with this. We got some other junk
  up there that there's more profit in than what there is in booze, and it's
  easier to handle. We know where to get rid of it; but the booze we can't
  handle as easy as you can, and so you're goin' to handle it."</p>

  <p>"Who says I am?"</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> do," returned Allen, with an ugly snarl. "Yo'll handle it, or
  I'll do just what I said I'd do, and I'll do it <i>pronto</i>. How'd you like
  your mother and that Pennington girl to hear all I'd have to say?"</p>

  <p>The boy sat with scowling, thoughtful brows for a long minute. From
  beneath a live oak, on the summit of a low bluff, a man discovered them. He
  had been sitting there talking with a girl. Suddenly he looked up.</p>

  <p>"Why, there's Guy," he said. "Who's that with&mdash;why, it's that fellow
  Allen! What's he doing up here?" He rose to his feet. "You stay here a
  minute, Grace. I'm going down to see what that fellow wants. I can't
  understand Guy."</p>

  <p>He untied the Apache and mounted, while below, just beyond the pasture
  fence, the boy turned sullenly toward Allen.</p>

  <p>"I'll go through with it this once," he said. "You'll bring it down on
  burros at night?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Where do you want it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Bring it to the west side of the old hay barn&mdash;the one that stands
  on our west line. When will you come?"</p>

  <p>"To-day's Tuesday. We'll bring the first lot Friday night, about twelve
  o'clock; and after that every Friday the same time. You be ready to settle
  every Friday for what you've sold during the week&mdash;<i>sabe</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Evans. "That's all, then"; and he turned and rode back
  toward the rancho.</p>

  <p>Allen was continuing on his way toward the hills when his attention was
  again attracted by the sound of hoof-beats. Looking to his left, he saw a
  horseman approaching from inside the pasture. He recognized both horse and
  rider at once, but kept sullenly on his way.</p>

  <p>Pennington rode up to the opposite side of the fence along which ran the
  trail that Allen followed.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here, Allen?" he asked in a not unkindly tone.</p>

  <p>"Mindin' my own business, like you better!" retorted the ex-stableman.</p>

  <p>"You have no business back here on Ganado," said Pennington. "You'll have
  to get off the property."</p>

  <p>"The hell I will!" exclaimed Allen.</p>

  <p>At the same time he made a quick movement with his right hand; but
  Pennington made a quicker.</p>

  <p>"That kind of stuff don't go here, Allen," said the younger man, covering
  the other with a forty-five. "Now turn around and get off the place, and
  don't come on it again. I don't want any trouble with you."</p>

  <p>Without a word, Allen reined his horse about and rode down the cañon; but
  there was murder in his heart. Pennington watched him until he was out of
  revolver range, and then turned and rode back to Grace Evans.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BENEATH the cool shadows of the north porch the master of
  Ganado, booted and spurred, rested after a long ride in the hot sun, sipping
  a long, cool glass of peach brandy and orange juice, and talking with his
  wife. A broad barley field lay below them, stretching to the State highway
  half a mile to the north. The yellowing heads of the grain stood motionless
  beneath the blazing sun. Inside the myriad kernels the milk was changing into
  dough. It would not be long now, barring fogs, before that gorgeous pageant
  of prosperity would be falling in serried columns into the maw of the
  binder.</p>

  <p>"We're going to have a bully crop of barley this year, Julia," remarked
  the colonel, fishing a small piece of ice from his glass. "Do you know, I'm
  beginning to believe this is better than a mint julep!"</p>

  <p>"Heavens, Custer&mdash;whisper it!" admonished his wife. "Just suppose the
  shades of some of your ancestors, or mine, should overhear such
  sacrilege!"</p>

  <p>The colonel chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Is it old age, or has this sunny land made me effeminate?" he queried.
  "It's quite a far cry from an old- fashioned mint julep to this home-made
  wine and orange juice. You can't call it brandy&mdash;it hasn't enough of
  what the boys call 'kick' to be entitled to that honor; but I like it. Yes,
  sir, that's bully barley&mdash;there isn't any better in the foothills!"</p>

  <p>"The oats look good, too," said Mrs. Pennington. "I haven't noticed the
  slightest sign of rust."</p>

  <p>"That's the result of the boy's trip to Texas last summer," said the
  colonel proudly. "Went down there himself and selected all the
  seed&mdash;didn't take anybody's word for it. Genuine Texas rustproof oats
  was what he went for and what he got. I don't know what I'd do without him,
  Julia. It's wonderful to see one's dreams come true! I've been dreaming for
  years of the time when my boy and I would work together and make Ganado even
  more wonderful than it ever was before; and now my dream's a reality. It's
  great, I tell you&mdash;it's great! Is there another glass of this Ganado
  elixir in that pitcher, Julia?"</p>

  <p>They were silent then for a few minutes, the colonel sipping his "elixir,"
  and Mrs. Pennington, with her book face down upon her lap, gazing out across
  the barley and the broad valley and the distant hills&mdash;into the future,
  perhaps, or back into the past.</p>

  <p>It had been an ideal life that they had led here&mdash;a life of love and
  sunshine and happiness. There had been nothing to vex her soul as she reveled
  in the delight of her babies, watching them grow into sturdy children and
  then develop into clean young manhood and womanhood. But growing with the
  passing years had been the dread of that day when the first break would come,
  as come she knew it must.</p>

  <p>She knew the dream that her husband had built, and that with it he had
  purposely blinded his eyes and dulled his ears to the truth which the mother
  heart would have been glad to deny, but could not. Some day one of the
  children would go away, and then the other. It was only right and just that
  it should be so, for as they two had built their own home and their own lives
  and their little family circle, so their children must do even as they.</p>

  <p>It was going to be hard on them both, much harder on the father, because
  of that dream that had become an obsession. Mrs. Pennington feared that it
  might break his spirit, for it would leave him nothing to plan for and hope
  for as he had planned and hoped for this during the twenty-two years that
  they had spent upon Ganado.</p>

  <p>Now that Grace was going to the city, how could they hope to keep their
  boy content upon the ranch? She knew he loved the old place, but he was
  entitled to see the world and to make his own place in it&mdash;not merely to
  slide spinelessly into the niche that another had prepared for him.</p>

  <p>"I am worried about the boy," she said presently.</p>

  <p>"How? In what way?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He will be very blue and lonely after Grace goes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me about it!" cried the colonel, banging his glass down
  upon the table and rising to his feet. "It makes me mad just to think of it.
  I can't understand how Grace can want to leave this beautiful world to live
  in a damned city! She's crazy! What's her mother thinking about, to let her
  go?"</p>

  <p>"You must remember, dear," said his wife soothingly, "that everyone is not
  so much in love with the country as yon, and that these young people have
  their own careers to carve in the way they think best. It would not be right
  to try to force them to live the way we like to live."</p>

  <p>"Damned foolishness, that's what it is!" he blustered. "An actress! What
  does she know about acting?"</p>

  <p>"She is beautiful, cultured, and intelligent. There is no reason why she
  should not succeed and make a great name for herself. Why shouldn't she be
  ambitious, dear? We should encourage her, now that she has determined to go.
  It would help her, for she loves us all&mdash;she loves you as a daughter
  might, for you have been like a father to her ever since Mr. Evans died."</p>

  <p>"Oh, pshaw, Julia!" the colonel exclaimed. "I love Grace&mdash;you know I
  do. I suppose it's because I love her that I feel so about this. Maybe I'm
  jealous of the city, to think that it has weaned her away from us. I don't
  mean all I say, sometimes; but really I am broken up at the thought of her
  going. It seems to me that it may be just the beginning of the end of the
  beautiful life that we have all led here for so many years."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever thought that some day our own children may want to go?" die
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I won't think about it!" he exploded.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't have to," she said; "but it's going to be pretty hard on
  the boy after Grace goes."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he'll want to go?" the colonel asked. His voice sounded
  suddenly strange and pleading, and there was a suggestion of pain and fear in
  his eyes that she had never seen there before in all the years that she had
  known him. "Do you think he'll want to go?" he repeated in a voice that no
  longer sounded like his own.</p>

  <p>"Stranger things have happened," she replied, forcing a smile, "than a
  young man wanting to go out into the world and win his spurs!"</p>

  <p>"Let's not talk about it, Julia," the colonel said presently. "You are
  right, but I don't want to think about it. When it comes will be time enough
  to meet it. If my boy wants to go, he shall go&mdash;and he shall never know
  how deeply his father is hurt!"</p>

  <p>"There they are now," said Mrs. Pennington. "I hear them in the patio.
  Children!" she called. "Here we are on the north porch!"</p>

  <p>They came through the house together, brother and sister, their arms about
  each other.</p>

  <p>"Cus says I am too young to get married," exclaimed the girl.</p>

  <p>"Married!" ejaculated the colonel. "You and Guy talking of getting
  married? What are you going to live on, child?</p>

  <p>"On that hill back there."</p>

  <p>She jerked her thumb in a direction that was broadly south by west.</p>

  <p>"That will give them two things to live on," suggested the boy,
  grinning.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;two things?" demanded the girl.</p>

  <p>"The hill and father," her brother replied, dodging.</p>

  <p>She pursued him, and he ran behind his mother's chair; but at last she
  caught him, and, seizing his collar, pretended to chastise him, until he
  picked her up bodily from the floor and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"Pity the poor goof she ensnares!" pleaded Custer, addressing his parents.
  "He will have three avenues of escape&mdash;being beaten to death, starved to
  death, or talked to death."</p>

  <p>Eva clapped a hand over his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," she cried. "Guy and I are going to build a teeny,
  weeny bungalow on that hill, all by ourselves, with a white tile splash board
  in the kitchen, and one of those broom closets that turn into an ironing
  board, and a very low, overhanging roof, almost flat, and a shower, and a
  great big living room where we can take the rugs up and dance, and a spiffy
  little garden in the back yard, and chickens, and Chinese rugs, and he is
  going to have a study all to himself where he writes his stories,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At last she had to stop and join in the laughter.</p>

  <p>"I think you are all mean," she added. "You always laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>"With you, little jabberer," corrected the colonel; "for you were made to
  be laughed with and kissed."</p>

  <p>"Then kiss me," she exclaimed, and sprang into his lap, at the imminent
  risk of deluging them both with "elixir"&mdash;a risk which the colonel,
  through long experience of this little daughter of his, was able to minimize
  by holding the glass at arm's length as she dived for him.</p>

  <p>"And when are you going to be married?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not for ages and ages!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"But are you and Guy engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!"</p>

  <p>"Then why in the world all this talk about getting married?" he inquired,
  his eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"Well, can't I talk?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Talk? I'll say she can!" exclaimed her brother.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TWO weeks later Grace Evans left for Hollywood and fame. She
  would permit no one to accompany her, saying that she wanted to feel that
  from the moment she left home she had made her own way, unassisted, toward
  her goal.</p>

  <p>Hers was the selfish egotism that is often to be found in otherwise
  generous natures. She had never learned the sweetness and beauty of
  sharing&mdash;of sharing her ambitions, her successes, and her failures, too,
  with those who loved her. If she won to fame, the glory would be hers; nor
  did it once occur to her that she might have shared that pride and pleasure
  with others by accepting their help and advice. If she failed, they would not
  have even the sad sweetness of sharing her disappointment.</p>

  <p>Over two homes there hovered that evening a pall of gloom that no effort
  seemed able to dispel. In the ranch house on Ganado they made a brave effort
  at cheerfulness on Custer Pennington's account. They did not dance that
  evening, as was their custom, nor could they find pleasure in the printed
  page when they tried to read. Bridge proved equally impossible.</p>

  <p>Finally Custer rose, announcing that he was going to bed. Kissing them all
  good night, as had been the custom since childhood, he went to his room, and
  tears came to the mother's eyes as she noted the droop in the broad shoulders
  as he walked from the room.</p>

  <p>The girl came then and knelt beside her, taking the older woman's hand in
  hers and caressing it.</p>

  <p>"I feel so sorry for Cus," she said. "I believe that none of us realize
  how hard he is taking this. He told me yesterday that it was going to be just
  the same as if Grace was dead, for he knew she would never be satisfied here
  again, whether she succeeded or failed. I think he has definitely given up
  all hope of their being married."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, dear, I am sure he is wrong," said her mother. "The engagement
  has not been broken. In fact Grace told me only a few days ago that she hoped
  her success would come quickly, so that she and Custer might be married the
  sooner. The dear girl wants us to be proud of our new daughter."</p>

  <p>"My God!" ejaculated the colonel, throwing his book down and rising to
  pace the floor. "Proud of her! Weren't we already proud of her? Will being an
  actress make her any dearer to us? Of all the damn fool ideas!"</p>

  <p>"Custer! Custer! You mustn't swear so before Eva," reproved Mrs.
  Pennington.</p>

  <p>"Swear?" he demanded. "Who in hell is swearing?"</p>

  <p>A merry peal of laughter broke from the girl, nor could her mother refrain
  from smiling.</p>

  <p>"It isn't swearing when popsy says it," cried the girl. "My gracious, I've
  heard it all my life, and you always say the same thing to him, as if I'd
  never heard a single little cuss word. Anyway, I'm going to bed now, popsy,
  so that you won't contaminate me. According to momsy's theory she should
  curse like a pirate by this time, after twenty-five years of it!"</p>

  <p>She kissed them, leaving them alone in the little family sitting room.</p>

  <p>"I hope the boy won't take it too hard," said the colonel after a
  silence.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he has been drinking a little too much lately," said the
  mother. "I only hope his loneliness for Grace won't encourage it."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't noticed it," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"He never shows it much," she replied. "An outsider would not know that he
  had been drinking at all when I can see that he has had more than he
  should."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that, dear," said the colonel. "A Pennington never
  drinks more than a gentleman should. His father and his grandsires, on both
  sides, always drank, but there has never been a drunkard in either family. I
  wouldn't give two cents for him if he couldn't take a man's drink like a man;
  but hell never go too far. My boy couldn't!"</p>

  <p>The pride and affection in the words brought the tears to the mother's
  eyes. She wondered if there had ever been father and son like these
  before&mdash;each with such implicit confidence in the honor, the integrity,
  and the manly strength of the other. <i>His boy</i> couldn't go wrong!</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington entered his room, lighted a reading lamp beside a deep,
  wide-armed chair, selected a book from a rack, and settled himself
  comfortably for an hour of pleasure and inspiration. But he did not open the
  book. Instead, he sat staring blindly at the opposite wall.</p>

  <p>Directly in front of him hung a water color of the Apache, done by Eva,
  and given to him the previous Christmas; a framed enlargement of a photograph
  of a prize Hereford bull; a pair of rusty Spanish spurs; and a frame of
  ribbons won by the Apache at various horse shows. Custer saw none of these,
  but only a gloomy vista of dreary years stretching through the dead monotony
  of endless ranch days that were all alike&mdash;years that he must travel
  alone.</p>

  <p>She would never come back, and why should she? In the city, in that new
  life, she would meet men of the world&mdash;men of broader culture than his,
  men of wealth&mdash;and she would be sought after. They would have more to
  offer her than he, and sooner or later she would realize it. He could not
  expect to hold her.</p>

  <p>Custer laid aside his book.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" he asked himself.</p>

  <p>Rising, he went to the closet and brought out a bottle. He had not
  intended drinking. On the contrary, he had determined very definitely not to
  drink that night; but again he asked himself the old question which, under
  certain circumstances of life and certain conditions of seeming hopelessness,
  appears unanswerable:</p>

  <p>"What is the use?"</p>

  <p>It is a foolish question, a meaningless question, a dangerous question.
  What is the use of what? Of combating fate&mdash;of declining to do the thing
  we ought not to do&mdash;of doing the thing we should do? It is not even a
  satisfactory means of self-justification; but amid the ruins of his dreams it
  was sufficient excuse for Custer Pennington's surrender to the craving of an
  appetite which was daily becoming stronger.</p>

  <p>The next morning he did not ride before breakfast with the other members
  of the family, nor, in fact, did he breakfast until long after they.</p><br>

  <p class="first">On the evening of the day of Grace's departure Mrs. Evans
  retired early, complaining of a headache. Guy Evans sought to interest
  himself in various magazines, but he was restless and too ill at ease to
  remain long absorbed. At frequent intervals he consulted his watch, and as
  the evening wore on he made numerous trips to his room, where he had recourse
  to a bottle like the one with which Custer Pennington was similarly
  engaged.</p>

  <p>It was Friday&mdash;the second Friday since Guy had entered into an
  agreement with Allen; and as midnight approached his nervousness
  increased.</p>

  <p>Young Evans, while scarcely to be classed as a strong character, was more
  impulsive than weak, nor was he in any sense of the word vicious. While he
  knew that he was breaking the law, he would have been terribly shocked at the
  merest suggestion that his acts placed upon him the brand of criminality.
  Like many another, he considered the Volstead Act the work of an organized
  and meddlesome minority, rather than the real will of the people. There was,
  in his opinion, no immorality in circumventing the Eighteenth Amendment
  whenever and wherever possible.</p>

  <p>The only fly in the ointment was the fact that the liquor in which he was
  at present trafficking had been stolen; but he attempted to square this with
  his conscience by the oft reiterated thought that he did not know it to be
  stolen goods&mdash;they couldn't prove that he knew it. However, the fly
  remained. It must have been one of those extremely obnoxious, buzzy flies, if
  one might judge by the boy's increasing nervousness.</p>

  <p>Time and again, during that long evening, he mentally reiterated his
  determination that once this venture was concluded, he would never embark
  upon another of a similar nature. The several thousand dollars which it would
  net him would make it possible for him to marry Eva and settle down to a
  serious and uninterrupted effort at writing&mdash;the one vocation for which
  he believed himself best fitted by inclination and preparation; but never
  again, he assured himself repeatedly, would he allow himself to be cajoled or
  threatened into such an agreement.</p>

  <p>He disliked and feared Allen, whom he now knew to be a totally
  unscrupulous man, and his introduction, the preceding Friday, to the
  confederates who had brought down the first consignment of whisky from the
  mountains had left him fairly frozen with apprehension as he considered the
  type of ruffians with whom he was associated. During the intervening week he
  had been unable to concentrate his mind upon his story-writing even to the
  extent of a single word of new material. He had worried and brooded, and he
  had drunk more than usual.</p>

  <p>As he sat waiting for the arrival of the second consignment, he pictured
  the little cavalcade winding downward along hidden trails through the
  chaparral of dark, mountain ravines. His nervousness increased as he realized
  the risk of discovery some time during the six months that it would take to
  move the contraband to the edge of the valley in this way&mdash;thirty-six
  cases at a time, packed out on six burros.</p>

  <p>He had little fear of the failure of his plan for hiding the liquor in the
  old hay barn and moving it out again the following day.</p>

  <p>For three years there had been stored in one end of the barn some fifty
  tons of baled melilotus. It had been sown as a cover crop by a former
  foreman, and allowed to grow to such proportions as to render the plowing of
  it under a practical impossibility. As hay it was in little or no demand, but
  there was a possibility of a hay shortage that year. It was against this
  possibility that Evans had had it baled and stored away in the barn, where it
  had lain ever since, awaiting an offer that would at least cover the cost of
  growing, harvesting, and baling. A hard day's work had so rearranged the
  bales as to form a hidden chamber in the center of the pile, ingress to which
  could readily be had by removing a couple of bales near the floor.</p>

  <p>A little after eleven o'clock Guy left the house and made his way to the
  barn, where he paced nervously to and fro in the dark interior. He hoped that
  the men would come early and get the thing over, for it was this part of the
  operation that seemed most fraught with danger.</p>

  <p>The disposal of the liquor was effected by daylight, and the very boldness
  and simplicity of the scheme seemed to assure its safety. A large motor
  truck&mdash;such trucks are constantly seen upon the roads of southern
  California, loaded with farm and orchard products and bound cityward&mdash;
  drove up to the hay barn on the morning after the receipt of the contraband.
  It backed into the interior, and half an hour later it emerged with a small
  load of baled melilotus. That there were thirty-six cases of bonded whisky
  concealed by the innocent-looking bales of melilotus Mr. Volstead himself
  could not have guessed; but such was the case.</p>

  <p>Where it went to after it left his hands Guy Evans did not know or want to
  know. The man who bought it from him owned and drove the truck. He paid Evans
  six dollars a quart in currency, and drove away, taking, besides the load on
  the floor of the truck, a much heavier burden from the mind of the young
  man.</p>

  <p>The whisky was in Guy's possession for less than twelve hours a week; but
  during those twelve hours he earned the commission of a dollar a bottle that
  Allen allowed him, for his great fear was that sooner or later some one would
  discover and follow the six burros as they came down to the barn. There were
  often campers in file hills. During the deer season, if they did not have it
  all removed by that time, they would be almost certain of discovery, since
  every courageous ribbon-counter clerk in Los Angeles hied valiantly to the
  mountains with a high-powered rifle, to track the ferocious deer to its
  lair.</p>

  <p>At a quarter past twelve Evans heard the sounds for which he had been so
  expectantly waiting. He opened a small door in the end of the hay barn,
  through which there filed in silence six burdened burros, led by one swarthy
  Mexican and followed by another. Quietly the men unpacked the burros and
  stored the thirty-six cases in the chamber beneath the hay. Inside this same
  chamber, by the light of a flash lamp, Evans counted out to one of them the
  proceeds from the sale of the previous week. The whole transaction consumed
  less than half an hour, and was carried on with the exchange of less than a
  dozen words. As silently as they had come the men departed, with their
  burros, into the darkness toward the hills, and young Evans made his way to
  his room and to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS the weeks passed, the routine of ranch life weighed more
  and more heavily on Custer Pennington. The dull monotony of it took the zest
  from the things that he had formerly regarded as the pleasures of existence.
  The buoyant Apache no longer had power to thrill. The long rides were but
  obnoxious duties to be performed. The hills had lost their beauty.</p>

  <p>Custer attributed his despondency to an unkind fate that had thwarted his
  ambitions. He thought that he hated Ganado; and he thought, too&mdash;he
  honestly thought&mdash;that freedom to battle for success in the heart of
  some great city would bring happiness and content. For all that, he performed
  his duties and bore himself as cheerfully as ever before the other members of
  his family, though his mother and sister saw that when he thought he was
  alone and unobserved he often sat with drooping shoulders, staring at the
  ground, in an attitude of dejection which their love could scarce
  misinterpret.</p>

  <p>The frequent letters that came from Grace during her first days in
  Hollywood had breathed a spirit of hopefulness and enthusiasm that might have
  proven contagious, but for the fact that he saw in her success a longer and
  probably a permanent separation. If she should be speedily discouraged, she
  might return to the foothills and put the idea of a career forever from her
  mind; but if she received even the slightest encouragement, Custer was
  confident that nothing could wean her from her ambition. He was the more sure
  of this because in his own mind he could picture no inducement sufficiently
  powerful to attract anyone to return to the humdrum existence of the ranch.
  Better be a failure in the midst of life, he put it to himself, than a
  success in the unpeopled spaces of its outer edge.</p>

  <p>Ensuing weeks brought fewer letters, and there was less of enthusiasm,
  though hope was still unquenched. She had not yet met the right people, Grace
  said, and there was a general depression in the entire picture industry.
  Universal had a new manager, and there was no guessing what his policy would
  be; Goldwyn had laid off half their force; Robertson- Cole had shut down. She
  was sure, though, that things would brighten up later, and that she would
  have her chance. Would they please tell her how Senator was, and give him her
  love, and kiss the Apache for her? There was just a note, perhaps, of
  homesickness in some of her letters; and gradually they became fewer and
  shorter.</p>

  <p>The little gatherings of the neighbors at Ganado continued. Other young
  people of the valley and the foothills came and danced, or swam, or played
  tennis. Their elders came, too, equally enjoying the hospitality of the
  Penningtons; and among these was the new owner of the little orchard beyond
  the Evans ranch.</p>

  <p>The Penningtons had found Mrs. Burke a quiet woman of refined tastes, and
  the possessor a quiet humor that made her always a welcome addition to the
  family circle. That she had known more of sorrow than of happiness was
  evidenced in many ways, but that she had risen above the petty selfishness of
  grief was strikingly apparent in her thoughtfulness for others, her quick
  sympathy, and the kindliness of her humor. Whatever ills fate had brought
  her, they had not left her soured.</p>

  <p>As she came oftener, and came to know the Penningtons better, she depended
  more and more on the colonel for advice in matters pertaining to her orchard
  and her finances. Of personal matters she never spoke. They knew that she had
  a daughter living in Los Angeles; but of the girl they knew nothing, for deep
  in the heart of Mrs. George Burke, who had been born Charity Cooper, was a
  strain of Puritanism that could not look with aught but horror upon the stage
  and its naughty little sister, the screen&mdash;though in her letters to that
  loved daughter there was no suggestion of the pain that the fond heart held
  because of the career the girl had chosen.</p>

  <p>Charity Cooper's youth had been so surrounded by restrictions that at
  eighteen she was as unsophisticated as a child of twelve. As a result, she
  had easily succumbed to the blandishments of an unscrupulous young Irish
  adventurer, who had thought that her fine family connections indicated
  wealth. When he learned the contrary, shortly after their marriage, he
  promptly deserted her, nor had she seen or heard aught of him since. Of him
  she never spoke, and of course the Penningtons never questioned her.</p>

  <p>At thirty-nine Mrs. George Burke still retained much of the frail and
  delicate beauty that had been hers in girlhood. The effort of moving from her
  old home and settling the new, followed by the responsibilities of the
  unfamiliar and highly technical activities of orange culture, had drawn
  heavily upon her always inadequate vitality. As the Penningtons became better
  acquainted with her, they began to feel real concern as to her physical
  condition; and this concern was not lessened by the knowledge that she had
  been giving the matter serious thought, as was evidenced by her request that
  the colonel would permit her to name him as executor of her estate in a will
  that she was making.</p><br>

  <p class="first">While life upon Ganado took its peaceful way, outwardly
  unruffled, the girl whose image was in the hearts of them all strove
  valiantly in the face of recurring disappointment toward the high goal upon
  which her eyes were set.</p>

  <p>If she could only have a chance! How often that half prayer, half cry of
  anguish, was in the silent voicing of her thoughts! If she could only have a
  chance! In the weeks of tramping from studio to studio she had learned much.
  For one thing, she had come to know the ruthlessness of a certain type of man
  that must and will some day be driven from the industry&mdash;that is, in
  fact, even now being driven out, though slowly, by the stress of public
  opinion and by the example of the men of finer character who are gradually
  making a higher code of ethics for the studios.</p>

  <p>She had learned even more from the scores of chance acquaintances who,
  through repeated meetings in the outer offices of casting directors, had
  become almost friends. Indeed, when she found herself facing the actuality of
  one of the more repulsive phases of studio procedure, it appeared more in the
  guise of habitude through the many references to it that she had heard from
  the lips of her more experienced fellows.</p>

  <p>She was interviewing, for the dozenth time, the casting director of the
  K.K.S. Studio, who had come to know her by sight, and perhaps to feel a
  little compassion for her&mdash; though there are those who will tell you
  that casting directors, having no hearts, can never experience so human an
  emotion as compassion.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Miss Evans," he said; "but I haven't a thing for you to-day."
  As she turned away, he raised his hand. "Wait!" he said. "Mr. Crumb is
  casting his new picture himself. He's out on the lot now. Go out and see
  him&mdash;he might be able to use you."</p>

  <p>The girl thanked him and made her way from the office building in search
  of Crumb. She stepped over light cables and picked her way across stages that
  were littered with the heterogeneous jumble of countless interior sets. She
  dodged the assistants of a frantic technical director who was attempting to
  transform an African water hole into a Roman bath in an hour and forty-five
  minutes. She bumped against a heavy shipping crate, through the iron-barred
  end of which a savage lioness growled and struck at her. Finally she
  discovered a single individual who seemed to have nothing to do and who
  therefore might be approached with a query as to where Mr. Crumb might be
  found. This resplendent idler directed her to an Algerian street-set behind
  the stages, and as he spoke she recognized him as the leading male star of
  the organization, the highest salaried person on the lot.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later she found the man she sought. She had never seen
  Wilson Crumb before, and her first impression was a pleasant one, for he was
  courteous and affable. She told him that she had been to the casting
  director, and that he had said that Mr. Crumb might be able to use her. As
  she spoke, the man watched her intently, his eyes running quickly over her
  figure without suggestion of offense.</p>

  <p>"What experience have you had?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just a few times as an extra," she replied.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't use you," he said; "unless"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"unless you would care to work in the semi-nude, which would
  necessitate making a test&mdash;in the nude."</p>

  <p>He waited for her reply. Grace Evans gulped. She could feel a scarlet
  flush mounting rapidly until it suffused her entire face. She could not
  understand why it was necessary to try her out in any less garmenture than
  would pass the censors; but then that is something which no one can
  understand.</p>

  <p>Here, possibly, was her opportunity. She had read in the papers that
  Wilson Crumb was preparing to make the greatest picture of his career. She
  thought of her constant prayer for a chance. Here was a chance, and yet she
  hesitated. The brutal, useless condition he had imposed outraged every
  instinct of decency and refinement inherent in her, just as it has outraged
  the same characteristics in countless other girls&mdash;just as it is doing
  in other studios in all parts of the country every day.</p>

  <p>"Is that absolutely essential?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," he replied.</p>

  <p>Still she hesitated. Her chance! If she let it pass, she might as well
  pack up and return home. What a little thing to do, after all, when one
  really considered it!</p>

  <p>It was purely professional. There would be nothing personal in it, if she
  could only succeed in overcoming her self-consciousness; but <i>could</i> she
  do it?</p>

  <p>Again she thought of home. A hundred times, of late, she had wished that
  she was back there; but she did not want to go back a failure. It was that
  which decided her.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said; "but there will not be many there will there?"</p>

  <p>"Only a camera-man and myself," he replied. "If it is convenient, I can
  arrange it immediately."</p>

  <p>Two hours later Grace Evans left the K.K.S. lot. She was to start work on
  the morrow at fifty dollars a week for the full period of the picture. Wilson
  Crumb had told her that she had a wonderful future, and that she was
  fortunate to have fallen in with a director who could make a great star of
  her. As she went, she left behind all her self- respect and part of her
  natural modesty.</p>

  <p>Wilson Crumb, watching her go, rubbed the ball of his right thumb to and
  fro across the back of his left hand, and smiled.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>The Apache danced along the wagon trail that led back into the hills. He
  tugged at the bit and tossed his head impatiently, flecking his rider's shirt
  with foam. He lifted his feet high and twisted and wriggled like an eel. He
  wanted to be off, and he wondered what had come over his old pal that there
  were no more swift, gay gallops, and that washes were crossed sedately by way
  of their gravelly bottoms, instead of being taken with a flying leap.</p>

  <p>Presently he cocked an eye ahead, as if in search of something. A moment
  later he leaped suddenly sidewise, snorting in apparent terror.</p>

  <p>"You old fool!" said Pennington affectionately.</p>

  <p>The horse had shied at a large white boulder lying beside the wagon trail.
  For nearly three years he had shied at it religiously every time he had
  passed it. Long before they reached it he always looked ahead to see if it
  was still there, and he would have been terribly disappointed had it been
  missing. The man always knew that the horse was going to shy&mdash;he would
  have been disappointed if the Apache had not played this little game of
  make-believe. To carry the game to its conclusion, the rider should gather
  him and force him snorting and trembling, right up to the boulder, talking to
  him coaxingly and stroking his arched neck, but at the same time not
  neglecting to press the spurs against his glossy sides if he hesitated.</p>

  <p>The Apache loved it. He loved the power that was his as exemplified by the
  quick, wide leap aside, and he loved the power of the man to force his nose
  to the boulder&mdash;the power that gave him such confidence in his rider
  that he would go wherever he was asked to go; but to-day he was disappointed.
  His pal did not force him to the boulder. Instead, Custer Pennington merely
  reined him into the trail again beyond it and rode on up Jackknife Cañon.</p>

  <p>Custer was looking over the pasture. It was late July. The hills were no
  longer green, except where their sides and summits were clothed with
  chaparral. The lower hills were browning beneath the hot summer sun, but they
  were still beautiful, dotted as they were with walnut and live oak.</p>

  <p>As Pennington rode, he recalled the last time he had ridden through
  Jackknife with Grace. She had been gone two months now&mdash;it seemed as
  many years. She no longer wrote often, and when she did write her letters
  were short and unsatisfying. He recalled all the incidents of that last ride,
  and they reminded him again of the new-made trail they had discovered, and of
  his oft-repeated intention of following it to see where it led. He had never
  had the time&mdash;he did not have the time to-day. The heifers with their
  calves were still in this pasture. He counted them, examined the condition of
  the feed, and rode back to the house.</p>

  <p>It was Friday. From the hill beyond Jackknife a man had watched through
  binoculars his every move. Three other men had been waiting below the watcher
  along the new-made trail. It was well for Pennington that he had not chosen
  that day to investigate.</p>

  <p>After he had turned back toward the ranch, the man with the binoculars
  descended to the others.</p>

  <p>"It was young Pennington," he said. The speaker was Allen. "I was thinking
  that it would be a fool trick to kill him, unless we have to. I have a better
  scheme. Listen&mdash;if he ever learns anything that he shouldn't know, this
  is what you are to do, if I am away."</p>

  <p>Very carefully and in great detail he elaborated his plan.</p>

  <p>"Do you understand?" he asked. They did, and they grinned.</p>

  <p>The following night, after the Penningtons had dined, a ranch hand came up
  from Mrs. Burke's to tell them that their new neighbor was quite ill, and
  that the woman who did her housework wanted Mrs. Pennington to come down at
  once as she was worried about her mistress.</p>

  <p>"We will be right down," said Colonel Pennington. They found Mrs. Burke
  breathing with difficulty, and the colonel immediately telephoned for a local
  doctor.</p>

  <p>After the physician had examined her, he came to them in the living
  room.</p>

  <p>"You had better send for Jones, of Los Angeles," he said. "It is her
  heart. I can do nothing. I doubt if he can; but he is a specialist. And," he
  added, "if she has any near relatives, I think I should notify them&mdash;at
  once."</p>

  <p>The housekeeper had joined them, and was wiping tears from her face with
  her apron.</p>

  <p>"She has a daughter in Los Angeles," said the colonel; "but we do not know
  her address."</p>

  <p>"She wrote her to-day, just before this spell," said the housekeeper. "The
  letter hasn't been mailed yet&mdash;here it is."</p>

  <p>She picked it up from the center table and handed it to the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Miss Shannon Burke, 1580 Panizo Circle, Hollywood," he read. "I will take
  the responsibility of wiring both Miss Burke and Dr. Jones. Can you get a
  good nurse locally?"</p>

  <p>The doctor could, and so it was arranged</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">GAZA DE LURE was sitting at the piano when Crumb arrived at
  the bungalow at 1421 Vista del Paso at a little after six in the evening of
  the last Saturday in July. The smoke from a half burned cigarette lying on
  the ebony case was rising in a thin, indolent column above the masses of her
  black hair. Her fingers idled through a dreamy waltz.</p>

  <p>Crumb gave her a surly nod as he closed the door behind him. He was tired
  and cross after a hard day at the studio. The girl, knowing that he would be
  all right presently, merely returned his nod and continued playing. He went
  immediately to his room, and a moment later she heard him enter the bathroom
  through another doorway.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later he merged, shaved, spruce, and smiling. A tiny powder
  had effected a transformation, just as she had known that it would. He came
  and leaned across the piano, close to her. She was very beautiful. It seemed
  to the man that she grew more beautiful and more desirable each day. The fact
  that she had been unattainable had fed the fires of his desire, transforming
  infatuation into as near a thing to love as a man of his type can ever
  feel.</p>

  <p>"Well, little girl!" he cried gayly. "I have good news for you."</p>

  <p>She smiled a crooked little smile and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The only good news that I can think of would be that the government had
  established a comfortable home for superannuated hop-heads, where they would
  be furnished, without cost, with all the snow they could use."</p>

  <p>The effects of her last shot were wearing off. He laughed
  good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"Really," he insisted; "on the level, I've got the best news you've heard
  in moons.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked wearily.</p>

  <p>"Old Battle-Ax has got her divorce," he announced, referring thus
  affectionately to his wife.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the girl, "that's good news&mdash;for her&mdash;if it's
  true."</p>

  <p>Crumb frowned.</p>

  <p>"It's good news for you," he said. "It means that I can marry you
  now."</p>

  <p>The girl leaned back on the piano bench and laughed aloud. It was not a
  pleasant laugh. She laughed until the tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"What is there funny about that?" growled the man. "It would mean a lot to
  you&mdash;respectability, for one thing, and success, for another. The day
  you become Mrs. Wilson Crumb I'll star you in the greatest picture that was
  ever made."</p>

  <p>"Respectability!" she sneered. "Your name would make me respectable, would
  it? It would be the insult added to all the injury you have done me. And as
  for starring&mdash;poof!" She snapped her fingers. "I have but one ambition,
  thanks to you, you dirty hound, and that is snow!" She leaned toward him, her
  two clenched fists almost shaking in his face. "Give me all the snow I need,"
  she cried, "and the rest of them may have their fame and their laurels!"</p>

  <p>He thought he saw his chance then. Turning away with a shrug, he walked to
  the fireplace and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well!" he said. "If you feel that way about it, all right;
  but"&mdash;he turned suddenly upon her&mdash;"you'll have to get out of here
  and stay out&mdash;do you understand? From this day on you can only enter
  this house as Mrs. Wilson Crumb, and you can rustle your own dope if you
  don't come back&mdash;understand?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him through narrowed lids. She reminded him of a tigress
  about to spring, and he backed away.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," she commanded in slow, level tones. "In the first place,
  you're lying to me about your wife getting her divorce. I'd have guessed as
  much if I hadn't known, for a hop-head can't tell the truth; but I do know.
  You got a letter from your attorney to-day telling you that your wife still
  insists not only that she never will divorce you, but that she will never
  allow you a divorce."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that you opened one of my letters?" he demanded
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Sure I opened it! I open 'em all&mdash;I steam 'em open. What do you
  expect," she almost screamed, "from the thing you have made of me? Do you
  expect honor and self-respect, or any other virtue, in a hype?"</p>

  <p>"You get out of here!" he cried. "You get out now&mdash;this minute!"</p>

  <p>She rose from the bench and came and stood quite close to him.</p>

  <p>"You'll see that I get all the snow I want, if I go?" she asked. He
  laughed nastily.</p>

  <p>"You don't ever get another bindle," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she admonished. "I wasn't through with what I started to say a
  minute ago. You've been hitting it long enough, Wilson, to know what one of
  our kind will do to get it. You know that either you or I would sacrifice
  soul and body if there was no other way. We would lie, or steal, or&mdash;
  murder! Do you get that, Wilson&mdash;<i>murder</i>? There is just one thing
  that I won't do, but that one thing is not murder, Wilson. Listen!" She
  lifted her face close to his and looked him straight in the eyes. "If you
  ever try to take it away from me, or keep it from me, Wilson, I shall kill
  you."</p>

  <p>Her tone was cold and unemotional, and because of that, perhaps, the
  threat seemed very real. The man paled.</p>

  <p>"Aw, come!" he cried. "What's the use of our scrapping? I was only
  kidding, anyway. Run along and take a shot&mdash;it'll make you feel
  better."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I need one; but don't get it into your head that / was
  kidding. I wasn't. I'd just as lief kill you as not&mdash;the only trouble is
  that killing's too damned good for you, Wilson!"</p>

  <p>She walked toward the bathroom door.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way," she said, pausing, "Allen called up this afternoon. He's
  in town, and will be up after dinner. He wants his money."</p>

  <p>She entered the bathroom and closed the door. Crumb lighted another
  cigarette and threw himself into an easy chair, where he sat scowling at a
  temple dog on a Chinese rug.</p>

  <p>The Japanese "schoolboy" opened a door and announced dinner, and a moment
  later Gaza joined Crumb in the little dining room. They both smoked
  throughout the meal, which they scarcely tasted. The girl was vivacious and
  apparently happy. She seemed to have forgotten the recent scene in the living
  room. She asked questions about the new picture.</p>

  <p>"We're going to commence shooting Monday," he told her. Momentarily he
  waxed almost enthusiastic. "I'm going to have trouble with that boob author,
  though," he said. "If they'd kick him off the lot, and give me a little more
  money, I'd make 'em the greatest picture ever screened!" Then he relapsed
  into brooding silence.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" she asked. "Worrying about Allen?</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," he said. "I'll stall him off again."</p>

  <p>"He isn't going to be easy to stall this time," she observed, "if I
  gathered the correct idea from his line of talk over the phone to-day. I
  can't see what you've done with all the coin, Wilson."</p>

  <p>"You got yours, didn't you?" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I got mine," she answered, "and it's nothing to me what you did
  with Allen's share; but I'm here to tell you that you've pulled a boner if
  you've double-crossed him. I'm not much of a character reader, as proved by
  my erstwhile belief that you were a high-minded gentleman; but it strikes me
  the veriest boob could see that that man Allen is a bad actor. You'd better
  look out for him."</p>

  <p>"I ain't afraid of him," blustered Crumb.</p>

  <p>"No, of course you're not," she agreed sarcastically. "You're a regular
  little lion-hearted Reginald, Wilson&mdash; that's what you are!"</p>

  <p>The doorbell rang.</p>

  <p>"There he is now," said the girl.</p>

  <p>Crumb paled.</p>

  <p>"What makes you think he's a bad man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Look at his face&mdash;look at his eyes," she admonished. "Hard? He's got
  a face like a brick-bat."</p>

  <p>They rose from the table and entered the living room as the Japanese
  opened the front door. The caller was Slick Allen. Crumb rushed forward and
  greeted him effusively.</p>

  <p>"Hello, old man!" he cried. "I'm mighty glad to see you. Miss de Lure told
  me that you had phoned. Can't tell you how delighted I am!"</p>

  <p>Allen nodded to the girl, tossed his cap upon a bench near the door, and
  crossed to the center of the room.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down, Mr. Allen?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"I ain't got much time," he said, lowering himself into a chair. "I come
  up here, Crumb, to get some money." His cold, fishy eyes looked straight into
  Crumb's. "I come to get all the money there is comin' to me. It's a trifle
  over ten thousand dollars, as I figure it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Crumb; "that's about it."</p>

  <p>"An' I don't want no stallin' this time, either," concluded Allen.</p>

  <p>"Stalling!" exclaimed Crumb in a hurt tone. "Who's been stalling?"</p>

  <p>"You have."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear man!" cried Crumb deprecatingly. "You know that in matters of
  this kind one must be circumspect. There were reasons in the past why it
  would have been unsafe to transfer so large an amount to you. It might easily
  have been traced. I was being watched&mdash;a fellow even shadowed me to the
  teller's window in my bank one day. You see how it is? Neither of us can take
  chances."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, too," said Allen; "but I've been taking chances right
  along, and I ain't been taking them for my health. I been taking them for the
  coin, and I want that coin&mdash;I want it <i>pronto</i>!"</p>

  <p>"You can most certainly have it," said Crumb.</p>

  <p>"All right!" replied Allen, extending a palm. "Fork it over."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you don't think that I have it here, do you?" demanded
  Crumb. "You don't think I keep such an amount as that in my home, I hope!</p>

  <p>"Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"In the bank, of course."</p>

  <p>"Gimme a check."</p>

  <p>"You must be crazy! Suppose either of us was suspected; that check would
  link us up fine. It would be as bad for you as for me. Nothing doing! I'll
  get the cash when the bank opens on Monday. That's the very best I can do. If
  you'd written and let me know you were coming, I could have had it for
  you."</p>

  <p>Allen eyed him for a long minute. "Very well," he said, at last. "I'll
  wait till noon Monday."</p>

  <p>Crumb breathed an inward sigh of profound relief.</p>

  <p>"If you're at the bank Monday morning, at half past ten, you'll get the
  money," he said. "How's the other stuff going? Sorry I couldn't handle that,
  but it's too bulky."</p>

  <p>"The hootch? It's goin' fine," replied Allen. "Got a young high-blood at
  the edge of the valley handlin' it&mdash; fellow by the name of Evans. He
  moves thirty-six cases a week. The kid's got a good head on him&mdash;worked
  the whole scheme out himself. Sells the whole batch every week, for cash, to
  a guy with a big truck. They cover it with hay, and this guy hauls it right
  into the city in broad daylight, unloads it in a warehouse he's rented, slips
  each case into a carton labeled somebody-or-other's soap, and delivers it a
  case at a time to a bunch of drug stores. This second guy used to be a drug
  salesman, and he's personally acquainted with every grafter in the
  business."</p>

  <p>As he talked, Allen had been studying the girl's face. She had noticed it
  before; but she was used to having men stare at her, and thought little of
  it. Finally he addressed her.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Miss de Lure," he said, "there's something mighty familiar
  about your face? I noticed it the first time I came here, and I been studyin'
  over it since. It seems like I'd known you somewhere else, or some one you
  look a lot like; but I can't quite get it straight in my head. I can't make
  out where it was, or when, or if it was you or some one else. I'll get it
  some day, though."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she replied. "I'm sure I never saw you before you came
  here with Mr. Crumb the first time."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know, either," replied Allen, scratching his head; "but
  it's mighty funny." He rose. "I'll be goin'," he said. "See you Monday at the
  bank&mdash;ten thirty sharp, Crumb!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, ten thirty sharp," repeated Crumb, rising. "Oh, say, Allen, will
  you do me a favor? I promised a fellow I'd bring him a bindle of M to-night,
  and if you'll hand it to him it'll save me the trip. It's right on your way
  to the car line. You'll find him in the alley back of the Hollywood Drug
  Store, just west of Cuyhenga on the south side of Hollywood Boulevard."</p>

  <p>"Sure, glad to accommodate," said Allen; "but how'll I know him?"</p>

  <p>"He'll be standin' there, and you walk up and ask him the time. If he
  tells you, and then asks if you can change a five, you'll know he's the guy
  all right. Then you hand him these two ones and a fifty-cent piece, and he
  hands you a five-dollar bill. That's all there is to it. Inside these two
  ones I'll wrap a bindle of M. You can give me the five Monday morning when I
  see you."</p>

  <p>"Slip me the junk," said Allen.</p>

  <p>The girl had risen, and was putting on her coat and hat.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going&mdash;home so early?" asked Crumb.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied. "I'm tired, and I want to write a letter."</p>

  <p>"I thought you lived here," said Allen.</p>

  <p>"I'm here nearly all day, but I go home nights," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>Slick Allen looked puzzled as he left the bungalow.</p>

  <p>"Goin' my way?" he asked of the girl, as they reached the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "I go in the opposite direction. Good night!"</p>

  <p>"Good night!" said Allen, and turned toward Hollywood Boulevard.</p>

  <p>Inside the bungalow Crumb was signaling central for a connection.</p>

  <p>"Give me the police station on Cuyhenga, near Hollywood," he said. "I
  haven't time to look up the number. Quick&mdash;it's important!"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence and then:</p>

  <p>"Hello! What is this? Listen! If you want to get a hop- head with the
  goods on him&mdash;right in the act of peddling&mdash; send a dick to the
  back of the Hollywood Drug Store, and have him wait there until a guy comes
  up and asks what time it is. Then have the dick tell him and say, 'Can you
  change a five?' That's the cue for the guy to slip him a bindle of morphine
  rolled up in a couple of one-dollar bills. If you don't send a dummy, he'll
  know what to do next&mdash;and you'd better get him there in a hurry. What?
  No&mdash;oh, just a friend&mdash;just a friend."</p>

  <p>Wilson Crumb hung up the receiver. There was a grin on his face as he
  turned away from the instrument.</p>

  <p>"It's too bad, Allen, but I'm afraid you won't be at the bank at half past
  ten on Monday morning!" he said.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS Gaza de Lure entered the house in which she roomed, her
  landlady came hastily from the living room.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Miss Burke?" she asked. "Here is a telegram that came for
  you just a few minutes ago. I do hope it's not bad news!"</p>

  <p>The girl took the yellow envelope and tore it open. She read the message
  through very quickly and then again slowly, her brows puckered into a little
  frown, as if she could not quite understand the meaning of the words she
  read.</p>

  <p>"Your mother ill," the telegram said. "Possibly not serious&mdash;doctor
  thinks best you come&mdash;will meet you morning train." It was signed
  "Custer Pennington."</p>

  <p>"I do hope it's not bad news," repeated the landlady.</p>

  <p>"My mother is ill. They have sent for me," said the girl. "I wonder if you
  would be good enough to call up the S. P. and ask the first train I can get
  that stops at Ganado, while I run upstairs and pack my bag?"</p>

  <p>"You poor little dear!" exclaimed the landlady. "I'm so sorry! I'll call
  right away, and then I'll come up and help you."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later she came up to say that the first train left at nine
  o'clock in the morning. She offered to help pack, but the girl said there was
  nothing that she could not do herself.</p>

  <p>"I must go out first for a few minutes," Gaza told her. "Then I will come
  back and finish packing the few things that it will be necessary to
  take."</p>

  <p>When the landlady had left, the girl stood staring dully at the black
  traveling bag that she had brought from the closet and placed on her bed; but
  she did not see the bag or the few pieces of lingerie that she had taken from
  her dresser drawers. She saw only the sweet face of her mother, and the dear
  smile that had always shone there to soothe each childish trouble&mdash;the
  smile that had lighted the girl's dark days, even after she had left
  home.</p>

  <p>For a long time she stood there thinking&mdash;trying to realize what it
  would mean to her if the worst should come. It could make no difference, she
  realized, except that it might perhaps save her mother from a still greater
  sorrow. It was the girl who was dead, though the mother did not guess it; she
  had been dead for many months. This hollow, shaking husk was not Shannon
  Burke&mdash;it was not the thing that the mother had loved. It was almost a
  sacrilege to take it up there into the clean country and flaunt it in the
  face of so sacred a thing as mother love.</p>

  <p>The girl stepped quickly to a writing desk, and, drawing a key from her
  vanity case, unlocked it. She took from it a case containing a hypodermic
  syringe and a few small phials; then she crossed the hall to the bathroom.
  When she came back, she looked rested and less nervous. She returned the
  things to the desk, locked it, and ran downstairs.</p>

  <p>"I will be back in a few minutes," she called to the landlady. "I shall
  have to arrange a few things to-night with a friend."</p>

  <p>She went directly to the Vista del Paso bungalow. Crumb was surprised and
  not a little startled as he heard her key in the door. He had a sudden vision
  of Allen returning, and he went white; but when he saw who it was he was no
  less surprised, for the girl had never before returned after leaving for the
  night.</p>

  <p>"My gracious!" he exclaimed. "Look who's here!"</p>

  <p>She did not return his smile.</p>

  <p>"I found a telegram at home," she said, "that necessitates my going away
  for a few days. I came over to tell you, and to get a little snow to last me
  until I come back. Where I am going they don't have it, I imagine."</p>

  <p>He looked at her through narrowed, suspicious lids.</p>

  <p>"You're going to quit me!" he cried accusingly. "That's why you went out
  with Allen! You can't get away with it. I'll never let you go. Do you hear
  me? I'll never let you go!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Wilson," she replied. "My mother is ill, and I have been
  sent for."</p>

  <p>"Your mother? You never told me you had a mother."</p>

  <p>"But I have, though I don't care to talk about her to you. She needs me,
  and I am going."</p>

  <p>He was still suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me the truth? Will you come back?"</p>

  <p>"You know I'll come back," she said. "I shall have to," she added with a
  weary sigh.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you'll have to. You can't get along without it. You'll come back all
  right&mdash;I'll see to that!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"How much snow you got home?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"You know I keep scarcely any there. I forgot my case to- day&mdash;left
  it in my desk, so I had a little there&mdash;a couple of shots, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said. "I'll give you enough to last a week&mdash;then
  you'll have to come home."</p>

  <p>"You say you'll give me enough to last a week?" the girl repeated
  questioningly. "I'll take what I want&mdash;it's as much mine as yours!"</p>

  <p>"But you don't get any more than I'm going to give you. I won't have you
  gone more than a week. I can't live without you&mdash;don't you understand? I
  believe you have a wooden heart, or none at all!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said, yawning, "you can get some other poor fool to peddle it
  for you if I don't come back; but I'm coming, never fear. You're as bad as
  the snow&mdash;I hate you both, but I can't live without either of you. I
  don't feel like quarreling, Wilson. Give me the stuff&mdash;enough to last a
  week, for I'll be home before that."</p>

  <p>He went to the bathroom and made a little package up for her.</p>

  <p>"Here!" he said, returning to the living room. "That ought to last you a
  week."</p>

  <p>She took it and slipped it into her case.</p>

  <p>"Well, good-by," she said, turning toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to kiss me good-by?" he asked</p>

  <p>"Have I ever kissed you, since I learned that you had a wife?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted; "but you might kiss me good-by now, when you're going
  away for a whole week." ^</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing, Wilson!" she said with a negative shake of the head. "I'd
  as lief kiss a Gila monster!"</p>

  <p>He made a wry face.</p>

  <p>"You're sure candid," he said.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders in a gesture of indifference and moved toward
  the door.</p>

  <p>"I can't make you out, Gaza," he said. "I used to think you loved me, and
  the Lord knows I certainly love you! You are the only woman I ever really
  loved. A year ago I believe you would have married me, but now you won't even
  let me kiss you. Sometimes I think there is some one else. If I thought you
  loved another man, I'd&mdash; I'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you wouldn't. You were going to say that you'd kill me, but you
  wouldn't. You haven't the nerve of a rabbit. You needn't worry&mdash;there
  isn't any other man, and there never will be. After knowing you I could never
  respect any man, much less love one of 'em. You're all alike&mdash;rotten!
  And let me tell you something&mdash;I never did love you. I liked you at
  first, before I knew the hideous thing that you had done to me. I would have
  married you, and I would have made you a good wife, too&mdash;you know that.
  I wish I could believe that you do love me. I know of nothing, Wilson, that
  would give me more pleasure than to <i>know</i> that you loved me madly; but
  of course you're not capable of loving anything madly, except yourself."</p>

  <p>"I do love you, Gaza," he said seriously. "I love you so that I would
  rather die than live without you."</p>

  <p>She cocked her head on one side and eyed him quizzically.</p>

  <p>"I hope you do," she told him; "for if it's the truth, I can repay you
  some measure of the suffering you have caused me. I can be around where you
  can never get a chance to forget me, or to forget the fact that you want me,
  but can never have me. You'll see me every day, and every day you will suffer
  vain regrets for the happiness that might have been yours, if you had been a
  decent, honorable man; but you are not decent, you are not honorable, you are
  not even a man!"</p>

  <p>He tried to laugh derisively, but she saw the slow red creep to his face
  and knew that she had scored.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll feel better when you come back from your mother's," he
  said. "You haven't been very good company lately. Oh, by the way, where did
  you say you are going?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Won't you give me your address?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But suppose something happens? Suppose I want to get word to you?" Crumb
  insisted.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to wait until I get back," she told him.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you can't tell me where you're going," he grumbled.</p>

  <p>"Because there is a part of my life that you and your sort have never
  entered," she replied. "I would as lief take a physical leper to my mother as
  a moral one. I cannot even discuss her with you without a feeling that I have
  besmirched her."</p>

  <p>On her face was an expression of unspeakable disgust as she passed through
  the doorway of the bungalow and closed the door behind her. Wilson Crumb
  simulated a shudder.</p>

  <p>"I sure was a damn fool," he mused. "Gaza would have made the greatest
  emotional actress the screen has ever known, if I'd given her a chance. I
  guessed her wrong and played her wrong. She's not like any woman I ever saw
  before. I should have made her a great success and won her
  gratitude&mdash;that's the way I ought to have played her. Oh, well, what's
  the difference? She'll come back!"</p>

  <p>He rose and went to the bathroom, snuffed half a grain of cocaine, and
  then collected all the narcotics hidden there and every vestige of
  contributary evidence of their use by the inmates of the bungalow. Dragging a
  small table into his bedroom closet, he mounted it and opened a trap leading
  into the air space between the ceiling and the roof. Into this he clambered,
  carrying the drugs with him.</p>

  <p>They were wrapped in a long, thin package, to which a light, strong cord
  was attached. With this cord he lowered the package into the space between
  the sheathing and the inner wall, fastening the end of the cord to a nail
  driven into one of the studs at arm's length below the wall plate.</p>

  <p>"There!" he thought, as he clambered back into the closet. "It'll take
  some dick to uncover that junk!"</p>

  <p>Hidden between plaster and sheathing of the little bungalow was a fortune
  in narcotics. Only a small fraction of their stock had the two peddlers kept
  in the bathroom, and Crumb had now removed that, in case Allen should guess
  that he had been betrayed by his confederate and direct the police to the
  bungalow, or the police themselves should trace his call and make an
  investigation on their own account. He realized that he had taken a great
  risk; but his stratagem had saved him from the deadly menace of Allen's
  vengeance, at least for the present. The fact that there must ultimately be
  an accounting with the man he put out of his mind. It would be time enough to
  meet that contingency when it arose.</p><br>

  <p class="first">As a matter of fact, the police came to the bungalow that
  very evening; but through no clue obtained from Allen, who, while he had
  suspicions that were tantamount to conviction, chose to await the time when
  he might wreak his revenge in his own way. The desk sergeant had traced the
  call to Crumb, and after the arrest had been made a couple of detective
  sergeants called upon him. They were quiet, pleasant-spoken men, with an
  ingratiating way that might have deceived the possessor of a less suspicious
  brain than Crumb's.</p>

  <p>"The lieutenant sent us over to thank you for that tip," said the
  spokesman. "We got him all right, with the junk on him."</p>

  <p>Not for nothing was Wilson Crumb a talented actor. None there was who
  could better have registered polite and uninterested incomprehension.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that I don't quite get you. What tip? What are
  you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"You called up the station, Mr. Crumb. We had central trace the call.
  There is no use&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Crumb interrupted him with a gesture. He didn't want the officer to go so
  far that it might embarrass him to retract.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, a light of understanding illuminating his face. "I
  believe I have it. What was the message? I think I can explain it."</p>

  <p>"We think you can, too," agreed the sergeant, "seem' you phoned the
  message."</p>

  <p>"No, but I didn't," said Crumb, "although I guess it may have come over my
  phone all right. I'll tell you what I know about it. A car drove up a little
  while after dinner, and a man came to the door. He was a stranger. He asked
  if I had a phone, and if he could use it. He said he wanted to phone an
  important and confidential message to his wife. He emphasized the
  'confidential,' and there was nothing for me to do but go in the other room
  until he was through. He was only a minute or two talking, and then he called
  me. He wanted to pay for the use of the phone. I didn't hear what he said
  over the phone, but I guess that explains the matter. Ill be careful next
  time a stranger wants to use my phone."</p>

  <p>"I would," said the sergeant dryly. "Would you know him if you saw him
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I sure would," said Crumb.</p>

  <p>They rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Nice little place you have here," remarked one of them, looking
  around.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Crumb, "it is very comfortable. Wouldn't you like to look it
  over?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the officer. "Not now&mdash;maybe some other time."</p>

  <p>Crumb grinned after he had closed the door behind them.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he mused, "if that was a threat or a prophecy!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">A week later Slick Allen was sentenced to a year in the
  county jail for having morphine in his possession.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS Shannon Burke alighted from the Southern Pacific train at
  Ganado, the following morning, a large, middle-aged man in riding clothes
  approached her.</p>

  <p>"Is this Miss Burke?" he asked. "I am Colonel Pennington."</p>

  <p>She noted that his face was grave, and it frightened her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about my mother," she said. "How is she?"</p>

  <p>He put an arm about the girl's shoulders. "Come," he said. "Mrs.
  Pennington is waiting over at the car."</p>

  <p>Her question was answered. Numb with dread and suffering, she crossed the
  station platform with him, the kindly, protecting arm still about her. Beside
  a closed car a woman was standing. As they approached, she came forward, put
  her arms about the girl, and kissed her.</p>

  <p>Seated in the tonneau between the colonel and Mrs. Pennington, the girl
  sought to steady herself. She had taken no morphine since the night before,
  for she had wanted to come to her mother "clean," as she would have expressed
  it. She realized now that it was a mistake, for she had the sensation of
  shattered nerves on the verge of collapse. Mastering all her resources, she
  fought for self-control with an effort that was almost physically
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she said at length in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"It was very sudden," said the colonel. "It was a heart attack. Everything
  that possibly could be done in so short a time was done. Nothing would have
  changed the outcome, however. We had Dr. Jones of Los Angeles down&mdash;he
  motored down and arrived here about half an hour before the end. He told us
  that he could have done nothing."</p>

  <p>They were silent for a while as the fast car rolled over the smooth road
  toward the hills ahead. Presently it slowed down, turned in between orange
  trees, and stopped before a tiny bungalow a hundred yards from the
  highway.</p>

  <p>"We thought you would want to come here first of all, dear," said Mrs.
  Pennington. "Afterward we are going to take you home with us."</p>

  <p>They accompanied her to the tiny living room, where they introduced her to
  the housekeeper, and to the nurse, who had remained at Colonel Pennington's
  request. Then they opened the door of a sunny bedroom, and, closing it after
  her as she entered left her alone with her dead.</p>

  <p>Beyond the thin panels they could hear her sobbing; but when she emerged
  fifteen minutes later, though her eyes were red, she was not crying. They
  thought then that she had marvelous self-control; but could they have known
  the hideous battle that she was fighting against grief and the insistent
  craving for morphine, and the raw, taut nerves that would give her no peace,
  and the shattered will that begged only to be allowed to sleep&mdash;could
  they have known all this, they would have realized that they were witnessing
  a miracle.</p>

  <p>They led her back to the car, where she sat with wide eyes staring
  straight ahead. She wanted to scream, to tear her clothing, to do anything
  but sit there quiet and rigid. The short drive to Ganado seemed to the
  half-mad girl to occupy hours. She saw nothing, not even the quiet, restful
  ranch house as the car swung up the hill and stopped at the north entrance.
  In her mind's eye was nothing but the face of her dead mother and the little
  black case in her traveling bag.</p>

  <p>The colonel helped her from the car and a sweet-faced young girl came and
  put her arms about her and kissed her, as Mrs. Pennington had done at the
  station.</p>

  <p>In a dazed sort of way Shannon understood that they were telling her the
  girl's name&mdash;that she was a daughter of the Penningtons. The girl
  accompanied the visitor to the rooms she was to occupy.</p>

  <p>Shannon wished to be alone&mdash;she wanted to get at the black case in
  the traveling bag. Why didn't the girl go away? She wanted to take her by the
  shoulders and throw her out of the room; yet outwardly she was calm and self-
  possessed.</p>

  <p>Very carefully she turned toward the girl. It required a supreme effort
  not to tremble, and to keep her voice from rising to a scream.</p>

  <p>"Please," she said, "I should like to be alone."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the girl, and left the room, closing the door behind
  her.</p>

  <p>Shannon crept stealthily to the door and turned the key in the lock. Then
  she wheeled and almost fell upon the traveling bag in her eagerness to get
  the small black case within it. She was trembling from head to foot, her eyes
  were wide and staring, and she mumbled to herself as she prepared the white
  powder and drew the liquid into the syringe.</p>

  <p>Momentarily, however, she gathered herself together. For a few seconds she
  stood looking at the glass and metal instrument in her fingers&mdash;beyond
  it she saw her mother's face.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do it," she sobbed. "I don't want to do it, mother!"</p>

  <p>Her lower lip quivered, and tears came. "My God, I can't help it!" Almost
  viciously she plunged the needle beneath her skin. "I didn't want to do it
  today, of all days, with you lying over there all alone&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>She threw herself across the bed and broke into uncontrolled sobbing; but
  her nerves were relaxed, and the expression of her grief was normal. Finally
  she sobbed herself to sleep, for she had not slept at all the night
  before.</p>

  <p>It was afternoon when she awoke, and again she felt the craving for a
  narcotic. This time she did not fight it She had lost the battle&mdash;why
  renew it? She bathed and dressed and took another shot before leaving her
  rooms&mdash;a guest suite on the second floor. She descended the stairs,
  which opened directly into the patio, and almost ran against a tall,
  broad-shouldered young man in flannel shirt and riding breeches, with boots
  and spurs. He stepped quickly back.</p>

  <p>"Miss Burke, I believe?" he inquired. "I am Custer Pennington."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was you who wired me," she said.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that was my father."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I did not thank him for all his kindness. I must have seemed
  very ungrateful."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, indeed, Miss Burke," he said, with a quick smile of sympathy. "We
  all understand, perfectly&mdash;you have suffered a severe nervous shock. We
  just want to help you all we can, and we are sorry that there is so little we
  can do."</p>

  <p>"I think you have done a great deal, already, for a stranger."</p>

  <p>"Not a stranger exactly," he hastened to assure her. "We were all so fond
  of your mother that we feel that her daughter can scarcely be considered a
  stranger. She was a very lovable woman, Miss Burke&mdash;a very fine
  woman."</p>

  <p>Shannon felt tears in her eyes, and turned them away quickly. Very gently
  he touched her arm.</p>

  <p>"Mother heard you moving about in your rooms, and she has gone over to the
  kitchen to make some tea for you. If you will come with me, I'll show you to
  the breakfast room. She'll have it ready in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>She followed him through the living room and the library to the dining
  room, beyond which a small breakfast room looked out toward the peaceful
  hills. Young Pennington opened a door leading from the dining room to the
  butler's pantry, and called to his mother.</p>

  <p>"Miss Burke is down," he said.</p>

  <p>The girl turned immediately from the breakfast room and entered the
  butler's pantry.</p>

  <p>"Can't I help, Mrs. Pennington? I don't want you to go to any trouble for
  me. You have all been so good already!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pennington laughed.</p>

  <p>"Bless your heart, dear, it's no trouble. The water is boiling, and Hannah
  has made some toast. We were just waiting to ask if you prefer green tea or
  black."</p>

  <p>"Green, if you please," said Shannon, coming into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Custer had followed her, and was leaning against the door frame.</p>

  <p>"This is Hannah, Miss Burke," said Mrs. Pennington.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad to know you, Hannah," said the girl. "I hope you won't think
  me a terrible nuisance."</p>

  <p>"Hannah's a brick," interposed the young man. "You can muss around her
  kitchen all you want, and she never gets mad."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure she doesn't," agreed Shannon; "but people who are late to meals
  <i>are</i> a nuisance, and I promise that I shan't be again. I fell
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"You may change your mind about being late to meals when you learn the
  hour we breakfast," laughed Custer.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I shall be on time."</p>

  <p>"You shall stay in bed just as late as you please," said Mrs. Pennington.
  "You mustn't think of getting up when we do. You need all the rest you can
  get."</p>

  <p>They seemed to take it for granted that Shannon was going to stay with
  them, instead of going to the little bungalow that had been her
  mother's&mdash;the truest type of hospitality, because, requiring no oral
  acceptance, it suggested no obligation.</p>

  <p>"But I cannot impose on you so much," she said. "After dinner I must go
  down to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pennington did not permit her to finish. "No, dear," she said,
  quietly but definitely. "You are to stay here with us until you return to the
  city. Colonel Pennington has arranged with the nurse to remain with your
  mother's housekeeper until after the funeral. Please let us have our way. It
  will be so much easier for you, and it will let us feel that we have been
  able to do something for you."</p>

  <p>Shannon could not have refused if she had wished to, but she did not wish
  to. In the quiet ranch house, surrounded by these strong, kindly people, she
  found a restfulness and a feeling of security that she had not believed she
  was ever to experience again. She had these thoughts when, under the
  influence of morphine, her nerves were quieted and her brain clear. After the
  effects had worn off, she became restless and irritable. She thought of Crumb
  then, and of the bungalow on the Vista del Paso, with its purple monkeys
  stenciled over the patio gate. She wanted to be back where she could be free
  to do as she pleased&mdash;free to sink again into the most degrading and
  abject slavery that human vice has ever devised.</p>

  <p>On the first night, after she had gone to her rooms, the Penningtons,
  gathered in the little family living room, discussed her, as people are wont
  to discuss a stranger beneath their roof.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she radiant?" demanded Eva. "She's the most beautifulest creature I
  ever saw!"</p>

  <p>"She looks much as her mother must have looked at the same age," commented
  the colonel. "There is a marked family resemblance.</p>

  <p>"She <i>is</i> beautiful," agreed Mrs. Pennington; "but I venture to say
  that she is looking her worst right now. She doesn't appear at all well, to
  me. Her complexion is very sallow, and sometimes there is the strangest
  expression in her eyes&mdash;almost wild. The nervous shock of her mother's
  death must have been very severe; but she bears up wonderfully, at that, and
  she is so sweet and appreciative!"</p>

  <p>"I sized her up over there in the kitchen to-day," said Custer. "She's the
  real article. I can always tell by the way people treat a servant whether
  they are real people or only counterfeit. She was as sweet and natural to
  Hannah as she is to mother."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," said his mother. "It is one of the hall marks of good
  breeding; but we could scarcely expect anything else of Mrs. Burke's
  daughter. I know she must be a fine character."</p>

  <p>In the room above them Shannon Burke, with trembling hands and staring
  eyes, was inserting a slender needle beneath the skin above her hip. In the
  movies one does not disfigure one's arms or legs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE day of the funeral had come and gone. It had been a very
  hard one for Shannon. She had determined that on this day, at least, she
  would not touch the little hypodermic syringe. She owed that much respect to
  the memory of her mother. And she had fought&mdash;God, how she had
  fought!&mdash;with screaming nerves that would not be quiet, with trembling
  muscles, and with a brain that held but a single thought&mdash; morphine,
  morphine, morphine!</p>

  <p>She tried to shut the idea from her mind. She tried to concentrate her
  thoughts upon the real anguish of her heart. She tried to keep before her a
  vision of her mother; but her hideous, resistless vice crowded all else from
  her brain, and the result was that on the way back from the cemetery she
  collapsed into screaming, incoherent hysteria.</p>

  <p>They carried her to her room&mdash;Custer Pennington carried her, his
  father and mother following. When the men had left, Mrs. Pennington and Eva
  undressed her and comforted her and put her to bed; but she still screamed
  and sobbed&mdash; frightful, racking sobs, without tears. She was trying to
  tell them to go away. How she hated them! If they would only go away and
  leave her! But she could not voice the words she sought to scream at them,
  and so they stayed and ministered to her as best they could. After a while
  she lost consciousness, and they thought that she was asleep and left
  her.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she did sleep, for later, when she opened her eyes, she lay very
  quiet, and felt rested and almost normal. She knew, though, that she was not
  entirely awake&mdash;that when full wakefulness came the terror would return
  unless she quickly had recourse to the little needle.</p>

  <p>In that brief moment of restfulness she thought quickly and clearly and
  very fully of what had just happened. She had never had such an experience
  before. Perhaps she had never fully realized the frightful hold the drug had
  upon her. She had known that she could not stop&mdash;or, at least, she had
  said that she knew; but whether she had any conception of the pitiful state
  to which enforced abstinence would reduce her is to be doubted. Now she knew,
  and she was terribly frightened.</p>

  <p>"I must cut it down," she said to herself. "I must have been hitting it up
  a little too strong. When I get home, I'll let up gradually until I can
  manage with three or four shots a day."</p>

  <p>When she came down to dinner that night, they were all surprised to see
  her, for they had thought her still asleep. Particularly were they surprised
  to see no indications of her recent breakdown. How could they know that she
  had just taken enough morphine to have killed any one of them? She seemed
  normal and composed, and she tried to infuse a little gayety into her
  conversation, for she realized that her grief was not theirs. She knew that
  their kind hearts shared something of her sorrow, but it was selfish to
  impose her own sadness upon them.</p>

  <p>She had been thinking very seriously, had Shannon Burke. The attack of
  hysteria had jarred her loose, temporarily at least, from the selfish rut
  that her habit and her hateful life with Crumb had worn for her. She recalled
  every emotion of the ordeal through which she had passed, even to the
  thoughts of hate that she had held for those two sweet women at the table
  with her. How could she have hated them? She hated herself for the
  thought.</p>

  <p>She compared herself with them, and a dull flush mounted to her cheek. She
  was not fit to remain under the same roof with them, and here she was sitting
  at their table, a respected guest! What if they should learn of the thing she
  was? The thought terrified her; and yet she talked on, oftentimes gaily,
  joining with them in the laughter that was a part of every meal.</p>

  <p>She really saw them, that night, as they were. It was the first time that
  her grief and her selfish vice had permitted her to study them. It was her
  first understanding glimpse of a family life that was as beautiful as her own
  life was ugly.</p>

  <p>As she compared herself with the women, she compared Crumb with these two
  men. They might have vices&mdash;they were strong men, and few strong men are
  without vices, she knew&mdash; but she was sure they were the vices of strong
  men, which, by comparison with those of Wilson Crumb, would become virtues.
  What a pitiful creature Crumb seemed beside these two, with his insignificant
  mentality and his petty egotism!</p>

  <p>Suddenly it came to her, almost as a shock, that she had to leave this
  beautiful place and go back to the sordid life that she shared with Crumb.
  Her spirit revolted, but she knew that it must be. She did not belong
  here&mdash;her vice must ever bar her from such men and women as these. The
  memory of them would haunt her always, making her punishment the more
  poignant to the day of her death.</p>

  <p>That evening she and Colonel Pennington discussed her plans for the
  future. She had asked him about disposing of the orchard&mdash;how she should
  proceed, and what she might ask for it.</p>

  <p>"I should advise you to hold it," he said. "It is going to increase in
  value tremendously in the next few years. You can easily get some one to work
  it for you on shares. If you don't want to live on it, Custer and I will be
  glad to keep an eye on it and see that it is properly cared for; but why
  don't you stay here? You could really make a very excellent living from it.
  Besides, Miss Burke, here in the country you can really <i>live</i>. You city
  people don't know what life is."</p>

  <p>"There!" said Eva. "Popsy has started. If he had his way, we'd all have to
  move to the city to escape the maddening crowd. He'd move the maddening crowd
  into the country!"</p>

  <p>"It may be that Shannon doesn't care for the country," suggested Mrs.
  Pennington. "There <i>are</i> such foolish people," she added, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I would love the country!" exclaimed Shannon.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you stay?" urged the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I had never thought of it," she said hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a new idea. Of course it was an absolute impossibility, but
  it was a very pleasant thing to contemplate.</p>

  <p>"Possibly Miss Burke has ties in the city that she would not care to
  break," suggested Custer, noting her hesitation.</p>

  <p>Ties in the city! Shackles of iron, rather, she thought bitterly; but, oh,
  it was such a nice thought! To live here, to see these people daily, perhaps
  be one of them, to be like them&mdash;ah, that would be heaven!</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I have ties in the city. I could not remain here, I am
  afraid, much as I should like to. I&mdash;? I think I had better sell."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" exclaimed the colonel. "You'll not sell. You are going to stay
  here with us until you are thoroughly rested, and then you won't want to
  sell."</p>

  <p>"I wish that I might," she said; "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But nothing!" interrupted the colonel. "You are not well, and I shan't
  permit you to leave until those cheeks are the color of Eva's."</p>

  <p>He spoke to her as he might have spoken to one of his children. She had
  never known a father, and it was the first time that any man had talked to
  her in just that way. It brought the tears to her eyes&mdash;tears of
  happiness, for every woman wants to feel that she belongs to some man&mdash;a
  father, a brother, or a husband&mdash;who loves her well enough to order her
  about for her own good.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to think it over," she said. "It means so much to me to have
  you all want me to stay! Please don't think that I don't want to;
  but&mdash;but&mdash;there are so many things to consider, and I want to stay
  so very, very much!"</p>

  <p>"All right," said the colonel. "It's decided&mdash;you stay. Now run off
  to bed, for you're going to ride with us in the morning, and that means that
  you'll have to be up at half past five."</p>

  <p>"But I can't ride," she said. "I don't know how, and I have nothing to
  wear."</p>

  <p>"Eva'll fit you out, and as for not knowing how to ride, you can't learn
  any younger. Why, I've taught half the children in the foothills to ride a
  horse, and a lot of the grown-ups. What I can't teach you Cus and Eva can.
  You're going to start in to-morrow, my little girl, and learn how to live.
  Nobody who has simply survived the counterfeit life of the city knows
  anything about living. You wait&mdash;we'll show you!"</p>

  <p>She smiled up into his face.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall have to mind you," she said. "I imagine every one
  does."</p><br>

  <p class="first">Seated in an easy chair in her bedroom, she stared at the
  opposite wall. The craving that she was seldom without was growing in
  intensity, for she had been without morphine since before dinner. She got up,
  unlocked her bag, and took out the little black case. She opened it, and
  counted the powders remaining. She had used half her supply&mdash;she could
  stay but three or four days longer at the outside; and the colonel wanted her
  to stay until her cheeks were like Eva's!</p>

  <p>She rose and looked in the mirror. How sallow she was! Something&mdash;she
  did not know what&mdash;had kept her from using rouge here. During the first
  days of her grief she had not even thought of it, and then, after that
  evening at dinner, she knew that she could not use it here. It was a make-
  believe, a sham, which didn't harmonize with these people or the life they
  led&mdash;a clean, real life, in which any form of insincerity had no place.
  She knew that they were broad people, both cultured and traveled, and so she
  could not understand why it was that she felt that the harmless vanity of
  rouge might be distasteful to them. Indeed, she guessed that it would not. It
  was something fine in herself, long suppressed, seeking expression.</p>

  <p>It was this same thing, perhaps, that had caused her to refuse a cigarette
  that Custer had offered her after dinner. The act indicated that they were
  accustomed to having women smoke there, as women nearly everywhere smoke
  to-day; but she had refused, and she was glad she had, for she noticed that
  neither Mrs. Pennington nor Eva smoked. Such women didn't have to smoke to be
  attractive to men. She had smoked in her room several times, for that habit,
  too, had a strong hold on her; but she had worked assiduously to remove the
  telltale stains from her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she mused, looking at the black case, "if I could get through
  the night without you! It would give me a few more hours here if I
  could&mdash;a few more hours of life before I go back to <i>that</i>!"</p>

  <p>Until midnight she fought her battle&mdash;a losing battle&mdash; tossing
  and turning in her bed; but she did her best before she gave up in
  defeat&mdash;no, not quite defeat; let us call it compromise, for the dose
  she took was only half as much as she ordinarily allowed herself. The
  three-hour fight and the half dose meant a partial victory, for it gained for
  her, she estimated, an additional six hours.</p>

  <p>At a quarter before six she was awakened by a knock on her door. It was
  already light, and she awoke with mingled surprise that she had slept so well
  and vague forebodings of the next hour or two, for she was unaccustomed to
  horses and a little afraid of them.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked, as the knock was repeated.</p>

  <p>"Eva. I've brought your riding things."</p>

  <p>Shannon rose and opened the door. She was going to take the things from
  the girl, but the latter bounced into the room, fresh and laughing.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" she cried. "Ill help you. Just pile your hair up
  anyhow&mdash;it doesn't matter&mdash;this hat'll cover it. I think these
  breeches will fit you&mdash;we are just about the same size; but I don't know
  about the boots&mdash;they may be a little large. I didn't bring any
  spurs&mdash;papa won't let any one wear spurs until they ride fairly well.
  You'll have to win your spurs, you see! It's a beautiful morning&mdash;just
  spiffy! Run in and wash up a bit. I'll arrange everything, and you'll be in
  'em in a jiffy."</p>

  <p>She seized Shannon around the waist and danced off toward the
  bathroom.</p>

  <p>"Don't be long," she admonished, as she returned to the dressing room,
  from where she laid down a barrage of conversation before the bathroom.</p>

  <p>Shannon washed quickly. She was excited at the prospect of the ride. That
  and the laughing, talking girl in the adjoining room gave her no time to
  think. Her mind was fully occupied and her nerves were stimulated. For the
  moment she forgot about morphine, and then it was too late, for Eva had her
  by the hand and she was being led, almost at a run, down the stairs, through
  the patio, and out over the edge of the hill down toward the stable.</p>

  <p>At first the full-foliaged umbrella trees through which the walk wound
  concealed the stable and corrals at the foot of the hill, but presently they
  broke upon her view, and she saw the horses saddled and waiting, and the
  other members of the family. The colonel and Mrs. Pennington were already
  mounted. Custer and a stableman held two horses, while the fifth was tied to
  a ring in the stable wall. It was a pretty picture&mdash;the pawing horses,
  with arched necks, eager to be away; the happy, laughing people in their
  picturesque and unconventional riding clothes; the new day upon the nearer
  hills; the haze upon the farther mountains.</p>

  <p>"Fine!" cried the colonel, as he saw her coming. "Really never thought
  you'd do it! I'll wager this is the earliest you have been up in many a day.
  'Barbarous hour'&mdash;that's what you're saying. Why, when my cousin was on
  here from New York, he was really shocked&mdash;said it wasn't decent. Come
  along&mdash;we're late this morning. You'll ride Baldy&mdash;Custer'll help
  you up."</p>

  <p>She stepped to the mounting block as the young man led the dancing Baldy
  close beside it.</p>

  <p>"Ever ridden much?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Never in my life."</p>

  <p>"Take the reins in your left hand&mdash;so. Like this&mdash;left- hand
  rein coming in under your little finger, the other between your first and
  second fingers, and the bight out between your first finger and
  thumb&mdash;there, that's it Face your horse, put your left hand on the horn,
  and your right hand on the cantle&mdash;this is the cantle back here. That's
  the ticket. Now put your left foot in the stirrup and stand erect&mdash;no,
  don't lean forward over the saddle&mdash;good! Swing your right leg, knee
  bent, over the cantle, at the same time lifting your right hand. When you
  come down, ease yourself into the saddle by closing on the horse with your
  knees&mdash; that takes the jar off both of you. Ride with a light rein. If
  you want him to slow down or stop, pull him in&mdash;don't jerk."</p>

  <p>He was holding Baldy close to the bit as he helped her and explained. He
  saw that her right foot found the stirrup, and that she had the reins
  properly gathered, and then he released the animal. Immediately Baldy began
  to curvet, raising both fore feet simultaneously, and, as they were coming
  down, raising his hind feet together, so that all four were off the ground at
  once.</p>

  <p>Shannon was terrified. Why had they put her on a bucking horse? They knew
  she couldn't ride. It was cruel!</p>

  <p>But she sat there with tight-pressed lips and uttered no sound. She
  recalled every word that Custer had said to her, and she did not jerk, though
  some almost irresistible power urged her to. She just pulled, and as she
  pulled she glanced about to see if they were rushing to her rescue. Great was
  her surprise when she discovered that no one was paying much attention to her
  or to the mad actions of her terrifying mount.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it dawned upon her that she had neither fallen off nor come near
  falling off. She had not even lost a stirrup. As a matter of fact, the motion
  was not even uncomfortable. It was enjoyable, and she was in about as much
  danger of being thrown as she would have been from a rocking chair as
  violently self-agitated. She laughed then, and in the instant all fear left
  her.</p>

  <p>She saw Eva mount from the ground, and noted that the stableman was not
  even permitted to hold her restive horse, much less to assist her in any
  other way. Custer swung to the saddle with the ease of long habitude. The
  colonel reined to her side.</p>

  <p>"We'll let them go ahead," he said, "and I'll give you your first lesson.
  Then I'll turn you over to Custer&mdash;he and Eva can put on the finishing
  touches."</p>

  <p>"He wants to see that you're started right," called the younger man,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"Popsy just wants to add another feather to his cap," said Eva. "Some day
  he'll 'point with pride' and say, 'Look at her ride! I gave her her first
  lesson.'"</p>

  <p>"Here come Mrs. Evans and Guy!"</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Pennington spoke, they saw two horses rounding the foot of the
  hill at a brisk canter, their riders waving a cheery long-distance
  greeting.</p>

  <p>That first morning ride with the Penningtons and their friends was an
  event in the life of Shannon Burke that assumed the proportions of adventure.
  The novelty, the thrill, the excitement, filled her every moment. The dancing
  horse beneath her seemed to impart to her a full measure of its buoyant life.
  The gay laughter of her companions, the easy fellowship of young and old, the
  generous sympathy that made her one of them, gave her but another glimpse of
  the possibilities for happiness that requires no artificial stimulus.</p>

  <p>She loved the hills. She loved the little trail winding through the leafy
  tunnel of a cool barranco. She loved the thrill of the shelving hillside
  where the trail clung precariously in its ascent toward some low summit. She
  tingled with the new life and a new joy as they broke into a gallop along a
  grassy ridge.</p>

  <p>Custer, in the lead, reined in, raising his hand in signal for them all to
  stop.</p>

  <p>"Look, Miss Burke," he said, pointing toward a near hillside. "There's a
  coyote. Thought maybe you'd never seen one on his native heath."</p>

  <p>"Shoot it! Shoot it!" cried Eva. "You poor boob, why don't you shoot
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Baldy's gun shy," he explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Eva. "Yes, of course&mdash;I forgot"</p>

  <p>"One of the things you do best," returned Custer loftily.</p>

  <p>"I was just going to say that you were not a boob at all, but now I
  won't!"</p>

  <p>Shannon watched the gray, wolfish animal turn and trot off dejectedly
  until it disappeared among the brush; but she was not thinking of the coyote.
  She was considering the thoughtfulness of a man who could remember to forego
  a fair shot at a wild animal because one of the horses in his party was gun
  shy, and was ridden by a woman unaccustomed to riding. She wondered if this
  was an index to young Pennington's character&mdash;so different from the men
  she had known. It bespoke a general attitude toward women with which she was
  unfamiliar&mdash;a protective instinct that was chiefly noticeable in the
  average city man by its absence.</p>

  <p>Interspersed with snatches of conversation and intervening silences were
  occasional admonitions directed at her by the colonel, instructing her to
  keep her feet parallel to the horse's sides, not to lean forward, to keep her
  elbows down and her left forearm horizontal.</p>

  <p>"I never knew there was so much to riding!" she exclaimed, laughingly. "I
  thought you just got on a horse and rode, and that was all there was to
  it."</p>

  <p>"That <i>is</i> all there is to it to most of the people you see riding
  rented horses around Los Angeles," Colonel Pennington told her. "It is all
  there can ever be to the great majority of people anywhere. Horsemanship is
  inherent in some; by others it can never be acquired. It is an art."</p>

  <p>"Like dancing," suggested Eva.</p>

  <p>"And thinking," said Custer. "Lots of people can go through the motions of
  riding, or dancing, or thinking, without ever achieving any one of them."</p>

  <p>"I can't even go through the motions of riding," said Shannon
  ruefully.</p>

  <p>"All you need is practice," said the colonel. "I can tell a born rider in
  half an hour, even if he's never been on a horse before in his life. You're
  one."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you're making fun of me. The saddle keeps coming up and
  hitting me, and I never see any of you move from yours."</p>

  <p>Guy Evans was riding close to her.</p>

  <p>"No, he's not making fun of you," he whispered, leaning closer to Shannon.
  "The colonel has paid you one of the greatest compliments in his power to
  bestow. He always judges people first by their morals and then by their
  horsemanship; but if they are good horsemen, he can make generous allowance
  for minor lapses in their morals."</p>

  <p>They both laughed.</p>

  <p>"He's a dear, isn't he?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"He and Custer are the finest men I ever knew," replied the boy
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>That ride ended in a rushing gallop along a quarter mile of straight road
  leading to the stables, where they dismounted, flushed, breathless, and
  laughing. As they walked up the winding concrete walk toward the house,
  Shannon Burke was tired, lame, and happy. She had adventured into a new world
  and found it good.</p>

  <p>"Come into my room and wash," said Eva, as they entered the patio. "We're
  late for breakfast now, and we all like to sit down together."</p>

  <p>For just an instant, and for the first time that morning, Shannon thought
  of the hypodermic needle in its blade case upstairs. She hesitated, and then
  resolutely turned into Eva's room.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the hour following breakfast that morning, while
  Shannon was alone in her rooms, the craving returned. The thought of it
  turned her sick when she felt it coming. She had been occupying herself
  making her bed and tidying the room, as she had done each morning since her
  arrival; but when that was done, her thoughts reverted by habit to the desire
  that had so fatally mastered her.</p>

  <p>While she was riding, she had had no opportunity to think of anything but
  the thrill of the new adventure. At breakfast she had been very hungry, for
  the first time in many months; and this new appetite for food, and the gay
  conversation of the breakfast table, had given her nerves no chance to assert
  their craving. Now that she was alone and unoccupied, the terrible thing
  clutched at her again.</p>

  <p>Once again she fought the fight that she had fought so many times of
  late&mdash;the fight that she knew she was ordained to lose before she
  started fighting. She longed to win it so earnestly that her defeat was the
  more pitiable. She was eager to prolong this new-found happiness to the
  uttermost limit. Though she knew that it must end when her supply of morphine
  was gone, she was determined to gain a few hours each day, in order that she
  might add at least another happy day to her life. Again she took but half her
  ordinary allowance; but with what anguished humiliation she performed the
  hated and repulsive act. Always had she loathed the habit, but never had it
  seemed nearly so disgusting as when performed amid these cleanly and
  beautiful surroundings, under the same roof with such people as the
  Penningtons.</p>

  <p>There crept into her mind a thought that had found its way there more than
  once before during the past two years&mdash; the thought of self-destruction.
  She put it away from her; but in the depth of her soul she knew that never
  before had it taken so strong a hold upon her. Her mother, her only tie, was
  gone, and no one would care. She had looked into heaven and found that it was
  not for her. She had no future except to return to the hideous existence of
  the Hollywood bungalow and her lonely boarding house, and to the hated
  Crumb.</p>

  <p>It was then that Eva Pennington called her.</p>

  <p>"I am going to walk up to the Berkshires," she said. "Come along with
  me!"</p>

  <p>"The Berkshires!" exclaimed Shannon. "I thought they were in New
  England."</p>

  <p>She was descending the stairs toward Eva, who stood at the foot, holding
  open the door that led into the patio. She welcomed the interruption that had
  broken in upon her morbid thoughts. The sight of the winsome figure smiling
  up at her dispelled them as the light of the sun sweeps away miasmatic
  vapors.</p>

  <p>"In New England?" repeated Eva. Her brows puckered, and then suddenly she
  broke into a merry laugh. "I meant pigs, not hills!"</p>

  <p>Shannon laughed, too. How many times she had laughed that day&mdash;and it
  was yet far from noon. Close as was the memory of her mother's death, she
  could laugh here with no consciousness of irreverence&mdash;rather, perhaps,
  with the conviction that she was best serving the ideals that had been dear
  to that mother by giving and accepting happiness when opportunity offered
  it.</p>

  <p>"I'm only sorry it's not the hills," she said; "for that would mean
  walking, walking, walking&mdash;doing something in the open, away from people
  who live in cities and who can find no pleasures outside four walls."</p>

  <p>Shannon's manner was tense, her voice had suddenly become serious. The
  younger girl looked up at her with an expression of mild surprise.</p>

  <p>"My gracious!" cried Eva. "You're getting almost as bad as popsy, and
  you've been here only half a week; but how radiant, if you really love
  it!"</p>

  <p>"I do love it, dear, though I didn't mean to be quite so tragic; but the
  thought that I shall have to go away and can never enjoy it again <i>is</i>
  tragic."</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't have to go," said Eva simply, slipping an arm about the
  other's waist. "We all hope that you won't have to."</p>

  <p>They walked down the hill, past the saddle-horse barn, and along the
  graveled road that led to the upper end of the ranch. The summer sun beat
  hotly upon them, making each old sycamore and oak and walnut a delightful
  oasis of refreshing shade. In a field at their left two mowers were clicking
  merrily through lush alfalfa. At their right, beyond the pasture fence,
  gentle Guernseys lay in the shade of a wide- spreading sycamore, a part of
  the pastoral allegory of content that was the Rancho del Ganado; and over all
  were the blue California sky and the glorious sun.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it wonderful?" breathed Shannon, half to herself. "It makes one
  feel that there cannot be a care or sorrow in all the world!"</p>

  <p>They soon reached the pens and houses where sleek, black Berkshires dozed
  in every shaded spot. Then they wandered farther up the cañon, into the
  pasture where the great brood sows sprawled beneath the sycamores, or
  wallowed in a concrete pool shaded by overhanging boughs. Eva stooped now and
  then to stroke a long, deep side.</p>

  <p>"How clean they are!" exclaimed Shannon. "I thought pigs were dirty."</p>

  <p>"They are when they are kept in dirty places&mdash;the same as
  people."</p>

  <p>"They don't smell badly; even the pens didn't smell of pig. All I noticed
  was a heavy, sweet odor. What was it&mdash; something they feed them?"</p>

  <p>Eva laughed.</p>

  <p>"It was the pigs themselves. The more you know pigs, the better you love
  'em. They're radiant creatures!"</p>

  <p>"You dear! You love everything, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty nearly everything, except prunes and washing dishes."</p>

  <p>They swung up then through the orange grove, and along the upper road back
  toward the house. It was noon and lunch time when they arrived. Shannon was
  hot and tired and dusty and delighted as she opened the door at the foot of
  the stairs that led up to her rooms above.</p>

  <p>There she paused. The old, gripping desire had seized her. She had not
  once felt it since she had passed through that door more than two hours
  before. For a moment she hesitated, and then, fearfully, she turned toward
  Eva.</p>

  <p>"May I clean up in your room?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was a strange note of appeal in Shannon's voice that the other girl
  did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly," she said; "but is there anything the matter? You are not
  ill?"</p>

  <p>"Just a little tired."</p>

  <p>"There! I should never have walked you so far. I'm so sorry!"</p>

  <p>"I want to be tired. I want to do it again this afternoon&mdash;all
  afternoon. I don't want to stop until I am ready to drop!"</p>

  <p>Then, seeing the surprise in Eva's expression, she added: "You see, I
  shall be here such a short time that I want to crowd every single moment full
  of pleasant memories."</p>

  <p>Shannon thought that she had never eaten so much before as she had that
  morning at breakfast; but at luncheon she more than duplicated her past
  performance. There was cold chicken&mdash;delicious Rhode Island Reds raised
  on the ranch; there was a salad of home-grown tomatoes&mdash;firm, deep-red
  beauties&mdash;and lettuce from the garden; Hannah's bread, with butter fresh
  from the churn, and tall, cool pitchers filled with rich Guernsey milk; and
  then a piece of Hannah's famous apple pie, with cream so thick that it would
  scarce pour.</p>

  <p>"My!" Shannon exclaimed at last. "I have seen the pigs and I have become
  one."</p>

  <p>"And I see something, dear," said Mrs. Pennington, smiling.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Some color in your cheeks."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>really</i>! she cried, delighted.</p>

  <p>"Yes, really."</p>

  <p>"And it's mighty becoming," offered the colonel. "Nothing like a brown
  skin and rosy cheeks for beauty. That's the way God meant girls to be, or He
  wouldn't have given 'em delicate skins and hung the sun up there to beautify
  'em. Here He's gone to a lot of trouble to fit up the whole world as a beauty
  parlor, and what do women do? They go and find some stuffy little shop poked
  away where the sun never reaches it, and pay some other woman, who knows
  nothing about art, to paint a mean imitation of a complexion on their poor
  skins. They wouldn't think of hanging a chromo in their living rooms; but
  they wear one on their faces, when the greatest Artist of them all is ready
  and willing to paint a masterpiece there for nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Popsy should have been a poet."</p>

  <p>"Or an ad writer for a cosmetic manufacturer," suggested Custer. "Oh, by
  the way, not changing the subject or anything, but did you hear about Slick
  Allen?"</p>

  <p>No, they had not. Shannon pricked up her ears, metaphorically. What did
  these people know of Slick Allen?</p>

  <p>"He's just been sent up in L.A. for having narcotics in his possession.
  Got a year in the county jail."</p>

  <p>"I guess he was a bad one," commented the colonel; "but he never struck me
  as being a drug addict."</p>

  <p>"Nor me; but I guess you can't always tell them," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"It must be a terrible habit," said Mrs. Pennington.</p>

  <p>"It's about as low as any one can sink," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"I hear that there's been a great increase in it since prohibition,"
  remarked the colonel. "Personally, I'd have more respect for a whisky
  drunkard than for a drug addict; or perhaps I should better say that I'd feel
  less disrespect. A police official told me not long ago, at a dinner in town,
  that if drug-taking continues to increase as it has recently, it will
  constitute a national menace by comparison with which the whisky evil will
  seem paltry."</p>

  <p>Shannon Burke was glad when they rose from the table, putting an end to
  the conversation. She had plumbed the uttermost depths of humiliation. She
  had felt herself go hot and cold in shame and fear. At first her one thought
  had been to get away&mdash;to find some excuse for leaving the Penningtons at
  once. If they knew the truth, what would they think of her? Not because of
  her habit alone, but because she had imposed upon their hospitality in the
  guise of decency, knowing that she was unclean, and practicing her horrid
  vice beneath their very roof; associating with their daughter and bringing
  them all in contact with her moral leprosy.</p>

  <p>She was hastening to her room to pack. She knew there was an evening train
  for the city, and while she packed she could be framing some plausible excuse
  for leaving thus abruptly.</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington called to her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Burke!"</p>

  <p>She turned, her hand upon the knob of the door to the upstairs suite.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ride over the back ranch this afternoon. Eva showed you the
  Berkshires this morning; now I want to show you the Herefords. I told the
  stableman to saddle Baldy for you. Will half an hour be too soon?"</p>

  <p>He was standing in the north arcade of the patio, a few yards from her,
  waiting for her reply. How fine and straight and clean he was! If fate had
  been less unkind, she might have been worthy of the friendship of such a man
  as he.</p>

  <p>Worthy? Was she unworthy, then? She had been just as fine and clean as
  Custer Pennington until a beast had tricked her into shame. She had not
  knowingly embraced a vice. It had already claimed her before she knew it for
  what it was. Must she then forego all hope of happiness because of a wrong of
  which she herself was innocent?</p>

  <p>She wanted to go with Custer. Another day would make no difference, for
  the Penningtons would never know. How could they? By what chance might they
  ever connect Shannon Burke with Gaza de Lure? She well knew that her screen
  days were over, and there was no slightest likelihood that any of these
  people would be introduced into the bungalow on the Vista del Paso. Who could
  begrudge her just this little afternoon of happiness before she went back to
  Crumb?</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me you don't want to come," cried Custer. "I won't take no for
  an answer!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I do want to come&mdash;ever so much! I'll be down in just a
  minute. Why wait half an hour?"</p>

  <p>She was in her room no more than five minutes, and during that time she
  sought bravely to efface all thought of the little black case; but with
  diabolic pertinacity it constantly obtruded itself, and with it came the
  gnawing hunger of nerves starving for a narcotic.</p>

  <p>"I won't!" she cried, stamping her foot. "I won't! I won't!"</p>

  <p>If only she could get away from the room before she succumbed to the
  mounting temptation, she was sure that she could fight it off for the rest of
  the afternoon. She had gained that much, at least; but she must keep
  occupied, constantly occupied, where she could not have access to it or see
  the black case in which she kept the morphine.</p>

  <p>She triumphed by running away from it. She almost hurled herself down the
  stairs and into the patio. Custer Pennington was not there. She must find him
  before the craving dragged her back to the rooms above. Already she could
  feel her will weakening. It was the old, old story that she knew so well.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" the voice of the tempter asked. "Just a little one! It
  will make you feel so much better. What's the use?"</p>

  <p>She turned toward the door again; she had her hand upon the knob, and then
  she swung back and called him. "Mr. Pennington!"</p>

  <p>If he did not hear, she knew that she would go up into her rooms
  defeated.</p>

  <p>"Coming!" he answered from beyond the arched entrance of the patio, and
  then he stepped into view.</p>

  <p>She almost ran to him.</p>

  <p>"Was I very long?" she asked. "Did I keep you waiting?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you've scarcely been gone any time at all," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Let's hurry," she said breathlessly. "I don't want to miss any of
  it!"</p>

  <p>He wondered why she should be so much excited at the prospect of a ride
  into the hills, but it pleased him that she was, and it flattered him a
  little, too. He began to be a little enthusiastic over the trip, which he had
  planned only as part of the generous policy of the family to keep Shannon
  occupied, so that she might not brood too sorrowfully over her loss.</p>

  <p>And Shannon was pleased because of her victory. She was too honest at
  heart to attempt to deceive herself into thinking that it was any great
  triumph; but even to have been strong enough to have run away from the enemy
  was something. She did not hope that it augured any permanent victory for the
  future, for she did not believe that such a thing was possible. She knew that
  scarce three in a hundred slaves of morphine definitely cast off their bonds
  this side of the grave, and she had gone too far to be one of the three. If
  she could keep going forever as she had that day, she might do it; but that,
  of course, was impossible. There must be hours when she would be alone with
  nothing to do but think, think, think, and what would she think about? Always
  the same things&mdash;the little white powder and the peace and rest that it
  would give her.</p>

  <p>Custer watched her as she mounted, holding Baldy beside the block for her,
  and again he was pleased to note that she did not neglect a single detail of
  the instructions he had given her.</p>

  <p>"Some girl, this!" the young man soliloquized mentally.</p>

  <p>He knew she must be at least a little lame and sore after the morning
  ride, but though he watched her face he saw no sign of it registered
  there.</p>

  <p>"Game!"</p>

  <p>He was going to like her. Stirrup to stirrup, they rode slowly up the lane
  toward the cañon road. Her form was perfect. She seemed to recall everything
  his father had told her, and she sat easily, with no stiffness.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want to ride faster?" she asked. "You needn't poke along on my
  account."</p>

  <p>"It's too hot," he replied; but the real reason was that he knew she was
  probably suffering, even at a walk.</p>

  <p>For a long time they rode in silence, the girl taking in every beauty of
  meadow, ravine, and hill, that she might store them all away for the days
  when they would be only memories. The sun beat down upon them fiercely, for
  it was an early August day, and there was no relieving breeze; but she
  enjoyed it. It was all so different from any day in her past, and so much
  happier than anything in the last two years, or anything she could expect in
  the future.</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington, never a talkative man, was always glad of a
  companionship that could endure long silences. Grace had been like that with
  him. They could be together for hours with scarce a dozen words exchanged;
  and yet both could talk well when they had anything to say. It was the
  knowledge that conversation was not essential to perfect understanding and
  comradeship that had rendered their intimacy delightful.</p>

  <p>The riders had entered the hills and were winding up Jackknife Cañon
  before either spoke.</p>

  <p>"If you tire," he said, "or if it gets too hot, well turn back. Please
  don't hesitate to tell me."</p>

  <p>"It's heavenly!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Possibly a few degrees too hot for heaven," he suggested; "but it's
  always cool under the live oaks. Any time you want to rest we'll stop for a
  bit."</p>

  <p>"Which are the live oaks?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He pointed to one.</p>

  <p>"Why are they called <i>live</i> oaks?"</p>

  <p>"They're evergreen&mdash;I suppose that's the reason. Here's a big old
  fellow&mdash;shall we stop?"</p>

  <p>"And get off?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I could get on again?"</p>

  <p>Pennington laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'll get you up all right. Still feel a little lame?"</p>

  <p>"Who said I was lame?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know you must be, but you're mighty game!"</p>

  <p>"I was when I started, but not any more. I seem to have limbered up. Let's
  try it. I want to see if I can get on from the ground, as Eva does. What are
  you smiling at? That's the second time in the last few seconds."</p>

  <p>"Was I smiling? I didn't know it. I didn't mean to."</p>

  <p>"What did I do?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't do anything&mdash;it was something you said. You won't mind,
  will you, as long as you are learning to ride a horse, if I teach you the
  correct terminology at the same time?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not! What did I say? Was it very awful?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; but it always amuses me when I hear it It's about getting on and
  off. You get on or off a street car, but you mount or dismount if you're
  riding a horse."</p>

  <p>"But I don't!" she exclaimed, laughing. "Falling on and off would suit my
  method better."</p>

  <p>"No, you mount very nicely. Now watch, and I'll show you how to dismount.
  Put your left hand on the horn; throw your right leg over the cantle,
  immediately grasping the cantle with the right hand; stand erect in the left
  stirrup, legs straight and heels together&mdash;you see, I'm facing right
  across the horse. Now support the weight of the body with your arms, like
  this; remove the left foot from the stirrup and drop to the ground, alighting
  evenly on both feet. That's the correct form and a good plan to follow while
  you're learning to ride. Afterward one gets to swing off almost any old
  way."</p>

  <p>"I thought one always <i>dismounted</i>," she suggested, "from a
  horse!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes twinkled. He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to be careful, won't I? You scored that time!"</p>

  <p>"Now watch me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" he exclaimed, as she dropped lightly to the ground.</p>

  <p>They led their horses beneath the spreading tree and sat down with their
  backs to the huge bole.</p>

  <p>"How cool it is here!" remarked the girl. "I can feel a breeze, though I
  hadn't noticed one before."</p>

  <p>"There always is a breeze beneath the oaks. I think they make their own. I
  read somewhere that an oak evaporates about one hundred and eighty gallons of
  water every day. That ought to make a considerable change of temperature
  beneath the tree on a hot day like this, and in that way it must start a
  circulation of air about it."</p>

  <p>"How interesting! How much there is to know in the world, and how little
  of it most of us know! A tree is a tree, a flower is a flower, and the hills
  are the hills&mdash;that much knowledge of them satisfies nearly all of us.
  The how and the why of them we never consider; but I should like to know
  more. We should know all about things that are so beautiful&mdash;don't you
  think so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "In ranching we do learn a lot that city people don't need
  to know&mdash;about how things grow, and what some plants take out of the
  soil, and what others put into it. It's part of our business to know these
  things, not only that we may judge the food value of certain crops, but also
  to keep our soil in condition to grow good crops every year."</p>

  <p>He told her how the tree beneath which they sat drew water and various
  salts from the soil, and how the leaves extracted carbon dioxide from the
  air, taking it in through myriads of minute mouths on the under sides of the
  leaves, and how the leaves manufactured starch and the sap carried it to
  every growing part of the tree, from deepest root to the tip of loftiest
  twig.</p>

  <p>The girl listened, absorbed. As she listened she watched the man's face,
  earnest and intelligent, and mentally she could not but compare him and his
  conversation with the men she had known in the city, and their conversation.
  They had talked to her as if she was a mental cipher, incapable of
  understanding or appreciating anything worth while&mdash;small talk, that
  subverter of the ancient art of conversation. In a brief half hour Custer
  Pennington had taught her things that would help to make the world a little
  more interesting and a little more beautiful; for she could never look upon a
  tree again as just a tree&mdash;it would be for her a living, breathing,
  almost a sentient creature.</p>

  <p>She tried to recall what she had learned from two years' association with
  Wilson Crumb, and the only thing she could think of was that Crumb had taught
  her to snuff cocaine.</p>

  <p>After a while they started on again, and the girl surprised the man by
  mounting easily from the ground. She was very much pleased with her
  achievement, laughing happily at his word of approval.</p>

  <p>They rode on until they found the Herefords. They counted them as they
  searched through the large pasture that ran back into the hills; and when the
  full number had been accounted for, they turned toward home. As he had told
  her about the trees, Custer told her also about the beautiful white-faced
  cattle, of their origin in the English county whose name they bear, and of
  their unequaled value as beef animals. He pointed out various prize winners
  as they passed them.</p>

  <p>"There you are, smiling again," she said accusingly, as they followed the
  trail homeward. "What have I done now?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't done anything but be very patient all afternoon. I was
  smiling at the idea of now thrilling the afternoon must have been for a city
  girl, accustomed, I suppose, to a constant round of pleasure and
  excitement!"</p>

  <p>"I have never known a happier afternoon," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you really mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Honestly!"</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said; "for sometimes I get terribly tired of it here, and
  I think it always does me good to have an outsider enthuse a little. It
  brings me a realization of the things we have here that city people can't
  have, and makes me a little more contented."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't be discontented! Why, there are just thousands and thousands
  of people in the city who would give everything to change places with you! We
  don't all live in the city because we want to. You are fortunate that you
  don't have to."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?"</p>

  <p>"I know it."</p>

  <p>"But it seems such a narrow life here! I ought to be doing a man's work
  among men, where it will count."</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> doing a man's work here and living a man's life, and what
  you do here <i>does</i> count. Suppose you were making stoves, or selling
  automobiles or bonds, in the city. Would any such work count for more than
  all this&mdash; the wonderful swine and cattle and horses that you are
  raising? Your father has built a great business, and you are helping him to
  make it greater. Could you do anything in the city of which you could be half
  so proud? No, but in the city you might find a thousand things to do of which
  you might be terribly ashamed. If I were a man, I'd like your chance!"</p>

  <p>"You're not consistent. You have the same chance, but you tell us that you
  are going back to the city. You have your grove here, and a home and a good
  living, and yet you want to return to the city you inveigh against."</p>

  <p>"I do <i>not</i> want to," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't, then," Custer said simply.</p>

  <p>They reached the house in time for a swim before dinner; but after dinner,
  when they started for the ballroom to dance, Shannon threw up her hands in
  surrender.</p>

  <p>"I give up!" she cried laughingly. "I tried to be game to the finish, and
  I want ever so much to come and dance; but I don't believe I could even walk
  as far as the ballroom, much less dance after I got there. Why, I doubt
  whether I'll be able to get upstairs without crawling!"</p>

  <p>"You poor child!" exclaimed Mrs. Pennington. "We've nearly killed you, I
  know. We are all so used to the long rides and walking and swimming and
  dancing that we don't realize how they tire unaccustomed muscles. You go
  right to bed, my dear, and don't think of getting up for breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I want to get up and ride, if I may, and if Eva will wake
  me."</p>

  <p>"She's got the real stuff in her," commented the colonel, after Shannon
  had bid them good night and gone to her rooms.</p>

  <p>"I'll say she has," agreed Custer. "She's a peach of a girl!"</p>

  <p>"She's simply divine," added Eva.</p>

  <p>In her room, Shannon could barely get into bed before she was asleep.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was four o'clock the following morning before she awoke.
  The craving awoke with her. It seized her mercilessly; yet even as she gave
  in to it, she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had gone without the
  little white powders longer this time than since she had first started to use
  them. She took but a third of her normal dose.</p>

  <p>When Eva knocked at half past five, Shannon rose and dressed in frantic
  haste, that she might escape a return of the desire. She did not escape it
  entirely, but she was able to resist it until she was dressed and out of
  reach of the little black case.</p>

  <p>That day she went with Custer and Eva and Guy to the country club,
  returning only in time for a swim before dinner; and again she fought off the
  craving while she was dressing for dinner. After dinner they danced, and once
  more she was so physically tired when she reached her rooms that she could
  think of nothing but sleep. The day of golf had kept her fully occupied in
  the hot sun, and in such good company her mind had been pleasantly occupied,
  too, so that she had not been troubled by her old enemy.</p>

  <p>Again it was early morning before she was forced to fight the implacable
  foe. She fought valiantly this time, but she lost.</p>

  <p>And so it went, day after day, as she dragged out her dwindling supply and
  prolonged the happy hours of her all too brief respite from the degradation
  of the life to which she knew she must soon return. Each day it was harder to
  think of going back&mdash;of leaving these people, whom she had come to love
  as she loved their lives and their surroundings, and taking her place again
  in the stifling and degraded atmosphere of the Vista del Paso bungalow. They
  were so good to her, and had so wholly taken her into their family life, that
  she felt as one of them. They shared everything with her. There was not a day
  that she did not ride with Custer out among the brown hills. She knew that
  she was going to miss these rides&mdash;that she was going to miss the man,
  too. He had treated her as a man would like other men to treat his sister,
  with a respect and deference that she had never met with in the City of
  Angels.</p>

  <p>Three weeks had passed. She had drawn out the week's supply that Crumb had
  doled out to her to this length, and there was even enough for another week,
  to such small quantities had she reduced the doses, and to such lengths had
  she increased the intervals between them. She had gone two whole days without
  it; yet she did not once think that she could give it up entirely, for when
  the craving came in full force she was still powerless to withstand it, and
  she knew that she would always be so.</p>

  <p>Without realizing it, she was building up a reserve force of health that
  was to be her strongest ally in the battle to come. The sallowness had left
  her; her cheeks were tanned and ruddy; her eyes sparkled with the old fire,
  and were no longer wild and staring. She could ride and walk and swim and
  dance with the best of them. She found interest in the work of her orchard,
  where she went almost daily to talk with the caretaker, to question him and
  to learn all that she could of citrus culture. She even learned to drive the
  light tractor and steer it in and out about the trees without barking
  them.</p>

  <p>Every day that she was there she went to the sunny bedroom in the
  bungalow&mdash;the bedroom that had been her mother's&mdash;and knelt beside
  the bed and poured forth her heart in blind faith that her mother heard. She
  did not grieve, for she held that sublime faith in the hereafter which many
  profess and few possess&mdash;the faith which taught her that her mother was
  happier than she had ever been before. Her sorrow had been in her own loss,
  and this she fought down as selfishness. She realized that her greatest
  anguish lay in vain regrets; and such thoughts she sought to stifle, knowing
  their uselessness.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she prayed there&mdash;prayed for strength to cast off the bonds
  of her servitude. Ineffectual prayers she knew them to be, for the only power
  that could free her had lain within herself, and that power the drug had
  undermined and permanently weakened. Her will had degenerated to impotent
  wishes.</p>

  <p>And now the time had come when she must definitely set a date for her
  departure. She had determined to retain the orchard, not alone because she
  had seen that it would prove profitable, but because it would always
  constitute a link between her and the people whom she had come to love. No
  matter what the future held, she could always feel that a part of her
  remained here, where she would that all of her might be; but she knew that
  she must go, and she determined to tell them on the following day that she
  would return to the city within the week.</p>

  <p>It was going to be hard to announce her decision, for she was not blind to
  the fact that they had grown fond of her, and that her presence meant much to
  Eva, who, since Grace's departure, had greatly missed the companionship of a
  girl near her own age. Mrs. Pennington and the colonel had been a mother and
  father to her, and Custer a big brother and a most charming companion.</p>

  <p>She passed that night without recourse to the white powders, for she must
  be frugal of them if they were to last through the week. The next morning she
  rode with the Penningtons and the Evanses as usual. She would tell them at
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>When she came to the table she found a pair of silver spurs beside her
  plate, and when she looked about in astonishment they were all smiling.</p>

  <p>"For me?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"From the Penningtons," said the colonel. "You've won 'em, my dear. You
  ride like a trooper already."</p>

  <p>The girl choked, and the tears came to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are all so lovely to me!" she said. Walking around the table to the
  colonel, she put her arms about his neck, and, standing on tiptoe, kissed his
  cheek. "How can I ever thank you?'</p>

  <p>"You don't have to, child. The spurs are nothing."</p>

  <p>"They are everything to me. They are a badge of honor
  that&mdash;that&mdash;I don't deserve!"</p>

  <p>"But you do deserve them. You wouldn't have got them if you hadn't. We
  might have given you something else&mdash;a vanity case or a book, perhaps;
  but no one gets spurs from the Penningtons who does not <i>belong</i>."</p>

  <p>After that she simply couldn't tell them then that she was going away. She
  would wait until to-morrow; but she laid her plans without reference to the
  hand of fate.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, immediately after luncheon, they were all seated in the
  patio, lazily discussing the chief topic of thought&mdash;the heat. It was
  one of those sultry days that are really unusual in southern California. The
  heat was absolutely oppressive, and even beneath the canvas canopy that
  shaded the patio there was little relief.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why we sit here," said Custer. "It's cooler in the house.
  This is the hottest place on the ranch a day like this!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be nice under one of those oaks up the cañon?" suggested
  Shannon.</p>

  <p>He looked at her and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Phew! It's too hot even to think of getting there"</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> from a Pennington!" she cried in mock astonishment and
  reproach.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that you'd ride up there through this heat?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Of course I would. I haven't christened my new spurs yet."</p>

  <p>"I'm game, then, if you are," Custer announced. She jumped to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Come on, then! Who else is going?" Shannon looked around at them
  questioningly. Mrs. Pennington shook her head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Not I. Before breakfast is enough for me in the summer time."</p>

  <p>"I have to dictate some letters," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"And I suppose little Eva has to stay at home and powder her nose,"
  suggested Custer, grinning at his sister.</p>

  <p>"Little Eva is going to drive over to Ganado with Guy Thackeray Evans, the
  famous author," said the girl. "He expects an express package&mdash;his
  story's coming back again. Horrid, stupid old editors! They don't know a real
  story when they see one. I'm in it&mdash;Guy put me in. You all ought to read
  it&mdash;oh, it's simply radiant! I'm <i>Hortense</i>&mdash; tall and willowy
  and very dignified&mdash;" Eva made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's you, unmistakably," said Custer. "Tall and willowy and very
  dignified&mdash;Guy's some hot baby at character delineation!"</p>

  <p>Eva ignored the interruption.</p>

  <p>"I swoon when the villain enters my room and carries me off. Then the
  hero&mdash;he's <i>Bruce Bellinghame</i>, tall and slender, with curly
  hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is he very dignified, too?"</p>

  <p>"And then the hero pursues and rescues me just as the villain is going to
  hurl me off a cliff&mdash;oh, it's gorgeristic!"</p>

  <p>"It must be," commented Custer.</p>

  <p>"You're horrid," said Eva. "You ought to have been an editor."</p>

  <p>"Tall and slender, with curly hair," gibed Custer. "Or was it tall and
  curly, with slender hair? Come on, Shannon! I see where we are the only real
  sports in the family."</p>

  <p>"Hot sports is what you're going to be!" Eva called after them.</p>

  <p>"The only real sports in the family&mdash;in the family!" The words
  thrilled her. They had taken her in&mdash;they had made her a part of their
  life. It was wonderful. Oh, God, if it could only last forever!</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was very hot. The dust rose from the shuffling feet of
  their horses. Even the Apache shuffled to-day. His head was low, and he did
  not dance. The dust settled on sweating neck and flank, and filled the eyes
  of the riders.</p>

  <p>"Lovely day for a ride," commented Custer.</p>

  <p>"But think how nice it will be under the oak," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he raised his head as his wandering eyes sighted a slender column
  of smoke rising from behind the ridge beyond Jackknife Cañon. He reined in
  the Apache.</p>

  <p>"Fire!" he said to the girl. "Wait here. I'll notify the boys, and then
  we'll ride on ahead and have a look at it. It may not amount to
  anything."</p>

  <p>He wheeled about and was off at a run&mdash;the heat and the dust
  forgotten. She watched him go, erect in the saddle, swinging easily with
  every motion of his mount&mdash;a part of the horse. In less than five
  minutes he was back.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" he cried.</p>

  <p>She swung Baldy in beside the Apache, and they were off. The loose stones
  clattered from the iron hoofs, the dust rose far behind them now, and they
  had forgotten the heat. A short-cut crossed a narrow wash that meant a
  jump.</p>

  <p>"Grab the horn!" he cried to her. "Give him his head!"</p>

  <p>They went over almost stirrup to stirrup, and he smiled broadly, for she
  had not grabbed the horn. She had taken the jump like a veteran.</p>

  <p>She thrilled with the excitement of the pace. The horses flattened
  out&mdash;their backs seemed to vibrate in a constant plane&mdash;it was like
  flying. The hot wind blew in her face and choked her; but she laughed and
  wanted to shout aloud and swing a hat.</p>

  <p>More slowly they climbed the side of Jackknife, and just beyond the ridge
  they saw the flames leaping in a narrow ravine below them. Fortunately there
  was no wind&mdash;no more than what the fire itself was making; but it was
  burning fiercely in thick brush.</p>

  <p>"There isn't a thing to do," he told her, "till the boys come with the
  teams and plows and shovels. It's in a mean place&mdash;too steep to plow,
  and heavy brush; but we've got to stop it!"</p>

  <p>Presently the "boys"&mdash;a wagon full of them&mdash;came with four
  horses, two walking plows, shovels, a barrel of water, and burlap sacks. They
  were of all ages, from eighteen to seventy. Some of them had been twenty
  years on the ranch, and had fought many a fire. They did not have to be told
  what to bring or what to do with what they brought.</p>

  <p>The wagon had to be left in Jackknife Cañon. The horses dragged the plows
  to the ridge, and the men carried the shovels and wet burlaps and buckets of
  water from the barrel. Custer dismounted and turned the Apache over to an old
  man to hold.</p>

  <p>"Plow down the east side of the ravine. Try to get all the way around the
  south side of the fire and then back again," he directed the two men with one
  of the teams. "I'll take the other, with Jake, and we'll try to cut her off
  across the top here!"</p>

  <p>"You can't do it, Cus," said one of the older men.</p>

  <p>"It's too steep."</p>

  <p>"We've got to try it," said Pennington. "Otherwise we'd have to go back so
  far that it would get away from us on the east side before we made the
  circle. Jake, you choke the plow handles&mdash;I'll drive!"</p>

  <p>Jake was a short, stocky, red-headed boy of twenty, with shoulders like a
  bull. He grinned good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>"I'll choke the tar out of 'em!" he said.</p>

  <p>"The rest of you shovel and beat like hell!" ordered Custer.</p>

  <p>Shannon watched him as he took the reins and started the team forward,
  slowly, quietly. There was no yelling.</p>

  <p>They were horsemen, these men of Ganado. The great Percherons moved
  ponderously forward. The plow point bit deep into the earth, but the huge
  beasts walked on as if dragging an empty wagon.</p>

  <p>When the girl saw where Custer was guiding them she held her breath. No,
  she must be mistaken! He would turn them up toward the ridge. He could not be
  thinking of trying to drive them across the steep, shelving side of the
  ravine!</p>

  <p>But he was. They slipped and caught themselves. Directly below them the
  burning brush had become a fiery furnace. If ever they failed to catch
  themselves, nothing could save them from that hell of heat.</p>

  <p>Jake, clinging to the plow handles, stumbled and slid, but the plow
  steadied him, and the furrow saved his footing a dozen times in as many
  yards. Custer, driving, walked just below the plow. How he kept the team
  going was a miracle to the girl.</p>

  <p>The steep sides of the ravine seemed almost perpendicular in places, with
  footing fit only for a goat. How those heavy horses clung there was beyond
  her. Only implicit confidence in these men of Ganado, who had handled them
  from the time they were foaled, and great courage, could account for it.</p>

  <p>What splendid animals they were! The crackling of burning brush, the
  roaring of the flames, the almost unbearable heat that swept up to them from
  below, must have been terrifying; and yet only by occasional nervous side
  glances and uppricked ears did they acknowledge their instinctive fear of
  fire.</p>

  <p>At first it had seemed to Shannon a mad thing to attempt, but as she
  watched and realized what Custer sought to accomplish, she understood the
  wisdom of it. If he could check the flames here with a couple of furrows, he
  might gain time to stop its eastward progress to the broad pastures filled
  with the tinder-dry grasses and brush of late August.</p>

  <p>Already some of the men were working with shovels, just above the furrow
  that the plow was running, clearing away the brush and throwing it back.
  Shannon watched these men, and there was not a shirker among them. They
  worked between the fierce heat of the sun and the fierce heat of the fire,
  each one of them as if he owned the ranch. It was fine proof of loyalty; and
  she saw an indication of the reason for it in Custer's act when he turned the
  Apache over to the oldest man, in order that the veteran might not be called
  upon to do work beyond his strength, while young Pennington himself undertook
  a dangerous and difficult part in the battle.</p>

  <p>The sight thrilled her; and beside this picture she saw Wilson Crumb
  directing a Western scene, sending mounted men over a steep cliff, while he
  sat in safety, beside the camera man, hurling taunts and insults at the poor
  devils who risked their lives for five dollars a day. He had killed one horse
  that time and sent two men to hospital, badly injured&mdash;and the next day
  he had bragged about it!</p>

  <p>Now they were across the ravine and moving along the east side on safer
  footing. Shannon realized the tension that had been upon her nerves when
  reaction followed the lessening of the strain&mdash;she felt limp and
  fagged.</p>

  <p>The smoke hid them from her occasionally, as it rose in cloudlike puffs.
  Then there would be a break in it, and she would see the black coats of the
  Percherons and the figures of the sweating men. They rounded well down the
  east side of the ravine and then turned back again; for the other team, with
  easier going, would soon be up on that side to join its furrow with theirs.
  They were running the second furrow just above the first, and this time the
  work seemed safer, for the horses had the first furrow below them should they
  slip&mdash;a ridge of loose earth that would give them footing.</p>

  <p>They were more than halfway back when it happened. The off horse must have
  stepped upon a loose stone, so suddenly did he lurch to the left, striking
  the shoulder of his mate just as the latter had planted his left forefoot.
  The ton of weight hurled against the shoulder of the near horse threw him
  downward against the furrow. He tried to catch himself on his right foot,
  crossed his forelegs, stumbled over the ridge of newly turned earth, and
  rolled down the hill, dragging his mate and the plow after him toward the
  burning brush below.</p>

  <p>Jake at the plow handles and Custer on the lines tried to check the
  horses' fall, but both were jerked from their hands, and the two Percherons
  rolled over and over into the burning brush. A groan of dismay went up from
  the men. It was with difficulty that Shannon stifled a scream; and then her
  heart stood still as she saw Custer Pennington leap deliberately down the
  hillside, drawing the long, heavy trail-cutting knife that he always wore on
  the belt with his gun.</p>

  <p>The horses were struggling and floundering to gain their feet. One of them
  was screaming with pain. The girl wanted to cover her eyes with her palms to
  shut out the heart- rending sight, but she could not take them from the
  figure of the man.</p>

  <p>She saw that the upper horse was so entangled with the harness and the
  plow that he could not rise, and that he was holding the other down. Then she
  saw the man leap into the midst of the struggling, terrified mass of
  horseflesh, seeking to cut the beasts loose from the tangled traces and the
  plow. It seemed impossible that he could escape the flying hoofs or the
  tongued flames that licked upward as if in hungry greed to seize this new
  prey.</p>

  <p>As Shannon watched, a great light awoke within her, suddenly revealing the
  unsuspected existence of a wondrous thing that had come into her life&mdash;a
  thing which a moment later dragged her from her saddle and sent her stumbling
  down the hill into the burning ravine, to the side of Custer Pennington.</p>

  <p>He had cut one horse free, seized its headstall, dragged it to its feet,
  and then started it scrambling up the hill. As he was returning to the other,
  the animal struggled up, crazed with terror and pain, and bolted after its
  mate. Pennington was directly in its path on the steep hillside. He tried to
  leap aside, but the horse struck him with its shoulder, hurling him to the
  ground, and before he could stop his fall he was at the edge of the burning
  brush, stunned and helpless.</p>

  <p>Every man of them who saw the accident leaped down the hillside to save
  him from the flames; but quick as they were, Shannon Burke was first to his
  side, vainly endeavoring to drag him to safety. An instant later strong hands
  seized both Custer and Shannon and helped them up the steep acclivity, for
  Pennington had already regained consciousness, and it was not necessary to
  carry him.</p>

  <p>Custer was badly burned, but his first thought was for the girl, and his
  next, when he found she was uninjured, for the horses. They had run for only
  a short distance and were standing on the ridge above Jackknife, where one of
  the men had caught them. One was burned about the neck and shoulder; the
  other had a bad cut above the hock, where he had struck the plow point in his
  struggles.</p>

  <p>"Take them in and take care of those wounds, Jake," said Pennington, after
  examining them. "You go along," he told another of the men, "and bring out
  Dick and Dave. I don't like to risk them in this work, but none of the colts
  are steady enough for this."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Shannon.</p>

  <p>"Why did you go down into that?" he asked. "You shouldn't have done
  it&mdash;with all the men here."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it," she said. "I thought you were going to be
  killed."</p>

  <p>Custer looked at her searchingly for a moment.</p>

  <p>"It was a very brave thing to do," he said, "and a very foolish thing. You
  might have been badly burned."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," she said. "<i>You</i> have been badly burned, and you
  must go to the house at once. Do you think you can ride?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," he said. "I've got to stay here and fight this fire."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to do anything of the kind." She turned and called to
  the man who held Pennington's horse. "Please bring the Apache over here," she
  said. "These men can fight the fire without you," she told Custer. "You are
  going right back with me. You've never seen any one badly burned, or you'd
  know how necessary it is to take care of your burns at once."</p>

  <p>He was not accustomed to being ordered about, and it amused him. Grace
  would never have thought of questioning his judgment in this or any other
  matter; but this girl's attitude implied that she considered his judgment
  faulty and his decisions of no consequence. She evidently had the courage of
  her convictions, for she caught up her own horse and rode over to the men,
  who had resumed their work, to tell them that Custer was too badly burned to
  remain with them.</p>

  <p>"I told him that he must go back to the house and have his burns dressed;
  but he doesn't want to. Maybe he would pay more attention to you, if you told
  him."</p>

  <p>"Sure, well tell him," cried one of them. "Here comes Colonel Pennington
  now. He'll make him go, if it's necessary."</p>

  <p>Colonel Pennington reined in a dripping horse beside his son, and Shannon
  rode over to them. Custer was telling him about the accident to the team.</p>

  <p>"Burned, was he?" exclaimed the colonel. "Why damn it, man, <i>you're</i>
  burned!"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing," replied the younger man.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> something, colonel," cried Shannon. "Please make him go back
  to the house. He won't pay any attention to me, and he ought to be cared for
  right away. He should have a doctor just as quickly as we can get one."</p>

  <p>"Can you ride?" snapped the colonel at Custer. "Of course I can ride!"</p>

  <p>"Then get out of here and take care of yourself. Will you go with him,
  Shannon? Have them call Dr. Baldwin."</p>

  <p>His rough manner did not conceal the father's concern, or his deep love
  for his boy. That he could be as gentle as a woman was evidenced, when he
  dismounted, in the way that he helped Custer to his saddle.</p>

  <p>"Take care of him, my dear," he said to Shannon. "I'll stay here and help
  the boys. Ask Mrs. Pennington to send the car out with some iced water or
  lemonade for them. Take care of yourself, boy!" he called after them as they
  rode away.</p>

  <p>As the horses moved slowly along the dusty trail, Shannon, riding a pace
  behind the man, watched his profile for signs of pain, that she knew he must
  be suffering. Once, when he winced, she almost gave a little cry, as if it
  had been she who was tortured. They were riding very close, and she laid her
  hand gently upon his right arm, in sympathy.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry!" she said. "I know it must pain you terribly."</p>

  <p>He turned to her with a smile on his face, now white and drawn.</p>

  <p>"It does hurt a little now," he said.</p>

  <p>"And you did it to save those two dumb brutes. I think it was magnificent,
  Custer!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her in mild surprise.</p>

  <p>"What was there magnificent about it? It was my duty. My father has always
  taught me that the ownership of animals entails certain moral obligations
  which no honorable man can ignore&mdash;that it isn't sufficient merely to
  own them, and feed them, and house them; but to serve and protect them, even
  if it entailed sacrifices to do so."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he meant that you should give your life for them," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"No, of course not; but I am not giving my life."</p>

  <p>"You might have."</p>

  <p>"I really didn't think there would be any danger to me," he said. "I guess
  I didn't think anything about it. I saw those two beautiful animals, who had
  been working there for me so bravely, helpless at the edge of that fire, and
  I couldn't have helped doing what I did under any circumstances. You don't
  know, Shannon, how we Penningtons love our horses. It's been bred in the bone
  for generations. Perhaps it's silly; but we don't think so."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. It's fine."</p>

  <p>By the time they reached the house she could see that the man was
  suffering excruciating pain. The stableman had gone to help the fire
  fighters, as had every able-bodied man on the ranch, so that she had to help
  Custer from the Apache. After tying the two horses at the stable, she put an
  arm about him and assisted him up the long flight of steps to the house.
  There Mrs. Pennington and Hannah came at her call and took him to his room,
  while she ran to the office to telephone for the doctor.</p>

  <p>When she returned, they had Custer undressed and in bed, and were giving
  such first aid as they could. She stood in the doorway for a moment, watching
  him, as he fought to hide the agony he was enduring. He rolled his head
  slowly from side to side, as his mother and Hannah worked over him; but he
  stifled even a faint moan, though Shannon knew that his tortured body must be
  goading him to screams. He opened his eyes and saw her, and tried to
  smile.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pennington turned then and discovered her.</p>

  <p>"Please let me do something, Mrs. Pennington, if there is anything I can
  do."</p>

  <p>"I guess we can't do much until the doctor comes. If we only had something
  to quiet the pain until then!"</p>

  <p>If they only had something to quiet the pain. The horror of it! She had
  something that would quiet the pain; but at what a frightful cost to herself
  must she divulge it! They would know, then, the sordid story of her vice.
  There could be no other explanation of her having such an outfit in her
  possession. How they would loathe her To see disgust in the eyes of these
  friends, whose good opinion was her one cherished longing, seemed a
  punishment too great to bear.</p>

  <p>And then there was the realization of that new force that had entered her
  life with the knowledge that she loved Custer Pennington. It was a hopeless
  love, she knew; but she might at least have had the happiness of knowing that
  he respected her. Was she to be spared nothing? Was her sin to deprive her of
  even the respect of the man whom she loved?</p>

  <p>She saw him lying there, and saw the muscles of his jaws tensing as he
  battled to conceal his pain; and then she turned and ran up the stairway to
  her rooms. She did not hesitate again, but went directly to her bag, unlocked
  it, and took out the little black case. Carefully she dissolved a little of
  the white powder&mdash;a fraction of what she could have taken without danger
  of serious results, but enough to allay his suffering until the doctor came.
  She knew that this was the end&mdash;that she might not remain under that
  roof another night.</p>

  <p>She drew the liquid through the needle into the glass barrel of the
  syringe, wrapped it in her handkerchief, and descended the stairs. She felt
  as if she moved in a dream. She felt that she was not Shannon Burke at all,
  but another whom Shannon Burke watched with pitying eyes; for it did not seem
  possible that she could enter that room and before his eyes and Mrs.
  Pennington's and Hannah's reveal the thing that she carried in her
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>Ah, the pity of it! To realize her first love, and in the same hour to
  slay the respect of its object with her own hand! Yet she entered the room
  with a brave step, fearlessly. Had he not risked his life for the two dumb
  brutes he loved? Could she be less courageous? Perhaps though, she was
  braver, for she was knowingly surrendering what was dearer to her than
  life.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pennington turned toward her as she entered.</p>

  <p>"He has fainted," she said. "My poor boy!"</p>

  <p>Tears stood in his mother's eyes.</p>

  <p>"He is not suffering, then?" asked Shannon, trembling.</p>

  <p>"Not now. For his sake, I hope he won't recover consciousness until after
  the doctor comes."</p>

  <p>Shannon Burke staggered and would have fallen had she not grasped the
  frame of the door.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the doctor came, and then she went back up the
  stairs to her rooms, still trembling. She took the filled hypodermic syringe
  from her handkerchief and looked at it. Then she carried it into the
  bathroom.</p>

  <p>"You can never tempt me again," she said aloud, as she emptied its
  contents into the lavatory. "Oh, dear God, I love him!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT night Shannon insisted upon taking her turn at Custer's
  bedside, and she was so determined that they could not refuse her. He was
  still suffering, but not so acutely. The doctor had left morphine, with
  explicit directions for its administration should it be required. The burns,
  while numerous, and reaching from his left ankle to his cheek, were
  superficial, and, though painful, not necessarily dangerous.</p>

  <p>He slept but little, and when he was awake he wanted to talk. He told her
  about Grace. It was his first confidence&mdash; a sweetly sad one&mdash;for
  he was a reticent man concerning those things that were nearest his heart and
  consequently the most sacred to him. He had not heard from Grace for some
  time, and her mother had had but one letter&mdash;a letter that had not
  sounded like Grace at all. They were anxious about her.</p>

  <p>"I wish she would come home!" he said wistfully. "You would like her,
  Shannon. We could have such bully times together! I think I would be content
  here if Grace were back; but without her it seems very different, and very
  lonely. You know we have always been together, all of us, since we were
  children&mdash;Grace, Eva, Guy, and I; and now that you are here it would be
  all the better, for you are just like us. You seem like us, at least&mdash;as
  if you had always lived here, too."</p>

  <p>"It's nice to have you say that; but I haven't always been here, and,
  really, you know I don't <i>belong</i>."</p>

  <p>"But you do belong!"</p>

  <p>"And I'm going away again pretty soon. I must go back to the city."</p>

  <p>"Please don't go back. You don't really have to, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I had intended telling you all this morning; but after the spurs, I
  couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Do you <i>really</i> have to go?" Custer insisted.</p>

  <p>"I don't have to, but I think I ought to. Do you want me to
  stay&mdash;honestly?"</p>

  <p>"Honest Injun!" he said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I will."</p>

  <p>He reached over with his right hand and took hers.</p>

  <p>"Oh, will you?" he exclaimed. "You don't know how much we want
  you&mdash;all of us."</p>

  <p>It was precisely what he might have done or said to Eva in boyish
  affection and comradeship.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to stay," she announced. "I've made up my mind. As soon as you
  are well I'm going to move down to my own place and really learn to work it.
  I'd love it!"</p>

  <p>"And I'll come down and help you with what little I know about oranges.
  Father will, too. We don't know much&mdash;citrus- growing is a little out of
  our line, though we have a small orchard here; but we'll give you the best
  we've got. And it'll be fine for Eva&mdash;she loves you. She cried the other
  day&mdash;the last time you mentioned in earnest that you might not
  stay."</p>

  <p>"She's a dear!"</p>

  <p>"She is all of that," he said. "We have always had our fights&mdash;I
  suppose all brothers and sisters do&mdash;and we kid one another a lot; but
  there never was a sister like Eva. Just let any one else say anything against
  me! They'd have a fight on their hands right there, if Eva was around. And
  sunshine! The old place seems like a morgue every time she goes away."</p>

  <p>"She worships you, Custer."</p>

  <p>"She's a brick!"</p>

  <p>He could have voiced no higher praise.</p>

  <p>He asked about the fire, and especially about the horses. He was delighted
  when she told him that a man had just come down to say that the fire was
  practically out, and the colonel was coming in shortly; and that the
  veterinary had been there and found the team not seriously injured.</p>

  <p>"I think that fire was incendiary," he said; "but now that Slick Allen is
  in jail, I don't know who would set it."</p>

  <p>"Who is Slick Allen," she asked, "and why should he want to set fire to
  Ganado?"</p>

  <p>He told her, and she was silent for a while, thinking about Allen and the
  last time she had seen him. She wondered what he would do when he got out of
  jail. She would hate to be in Wilson Crumb's boots then, for she guessed that
  Allen was a hard character.</p>

  <p>While she was thinking of Allen, Custer mentioned Guy Evans. Instantly
  there came to her mind, for the first time since that last evening at the
  Vista del Paso bungalow, Crumb's conversation with Allen and the latter's
  account of the disposition of the stolen whisky. His very words returned to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Got a young high-blood at the edge of the valley handling it&mdash;a
  fellow by the name of Evans."</p>

  <p>She had not connected Allen or that conversation or the Evans he had
  mentioned with these people; but now she knew that it was Guy Evans who was
  disposing of the stolen liquor. She wondered if Allen would return to this
  part of the country after he was released from jail. If he did, and saw her,
  he would be sure to recognize her, for he must have had her features
  impressed upon his memory by the fact that she so resembled some one he had
  known.</p>

  <p>If he recognized her, would be expose her? She did not doubt but that he
  would. The chances were that he would attempt to blackmail her; but, worst of
  all, he might tell Crumb where she was. That was the thing she dreaded
  most&mdash; seeing Wilson Crumb again, or having him discover her
  whereabouts; for she knew that he would leave no stone unturned, and hesitate
  to stoop to no dishonorable act, to get her back again. She shuddered when
  she thought of him&mdash;a man whose love, even, was a dishonorable and
  dishonoring thing.</p>

  <p>Then she turned her eyes to the face of the man lying there on the bed
  beside which she sat. He would never love her; but her love for him had
  already ennobled her.</p>

  <p>If the people of her old life did not discover her hiding place, she could
  remain here on her little grove, near Ganado, and see Custer
  often&mdash;nearly every day. He would not guess her love&mdash;no one would
  guess it; but she should be happy just to be near him. Even if Grace
  returned, it would make no difference&mdash;even if Grace and Custer were
  married. Shannon knew that he was not for her&mdash;no honorable man was for
  her, after what she had been&mdash;but there was no moral law to be
  transgressed by her secret love for him.</p>

  <p>She felt no jealousy for Grace. He belonged to Grace, and even had she
  thought she might win him she would not have attempted it, for she had always
  held in contempt those who infringed selfishly upon settled affections. It
  would be hard for her, of course, when Grace returned; but she was determined
  to like her, even to love her. She would be untrue to this new love that had
  transfigured her should she fail to love what <i>he</i> loved.</p>

  <p>Custer moved restlessly. Again he was giving evidence of suffering. She
  laid a cool palm upon his forehead, and stroked it. He opened his eyes and
  smiled up at her.</p>

  <p>"It's bully of you to sit with me," he said; "but you ought to be in bed.
  You've had a pretty hard day, and you're not as used to it as we are."</p>

  <p>"I am not tired," she said, "and I should like to stay&mdash; if you would
  like to have me."</p>

  <p>He took her hand from his forehead and kissed it.</p>

  <p>"Of course I like to have you here, Shannon&mdash;you're just like a
  sister. It's funny, isn't it, that we should all feel that way about you,
  when we've only known you a few weeks? It must have been because of the way
  you fitted in. You belonged right from the start&mdash;you were just like
  us."</p>

  <p>She turned her head away suddenly, casting her eyes upon the floor and
  biting her lip to keep back the tears.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not like you, Custer; but I have tried hard to be."</p>

  <p>"Why aren't you like us?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;why, I&mdash;couldn't ride a horse," she explained lamely.</p>

  <p>"Don't make me laugh, please; my face is burned," he pleaded in mock
  irony. "Do you think that's all we know, or think of, or possess&mdash;our
  horsemanship? We have hearts, and minds, such as they are&mdash;and souls, I
  hope. It was of these things that I was thinking. I was thinking, too, that
  we Penningtons demand a higher standard in women than is customary nowadays.
  We are a little old-fashioned, I guess. We want the blood of our horses and
  the minds of our women pure. Here is a case in point&mdash;I can tell you,
  because you don't know the girl and never will. She was the daughter of a
  friend of Cousin William&mdash;our New York cousin. She was spending the
  winter in Pasadena, and we had her out here on Cousin William's account. She
  was a pippin of a looker, and I suppose she was all right morally; but she
  didn't have a clean mind. I discovered it about the first time I talked with
  her alone; and then Eva asked me a question about something that she couldn't
  have known about at all except through this girl. I didn't know what to do.
  She was a girl, and so I couldn't talk about her to any one, not even my
  father or mother; but I didn't want her around Eva. I wondered if I was just
  a narrow prig, and if, after all, there was nothing that any one need take
  exception to in the girl. I got to analyzing the thing, and I came to the
  conclusion that I would be ashamed of mother and Eva if they talked or
  thought along such lines. Consequently, it wasn't right to expose Eva to that
  influence. That was what I decided, and I don't just <i>think</i> I was
  right&mdash;I <i>know</i> I was."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do?" Shannon asked in a very small voice.</p>

  <p>"I did what under any other circumstances would have been unpardonable. I
  went to the girl and asked her to make some excuse that would terminate her
  visit It was a very hard thing to do; but I would do more than that&mdash;I
  would sacrifice my most cherished friendship&mdash;for Eva."</p>

  <p>"And the girl&mdash;did you tell her why you asked her to go?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to, but she insisted, and I told her."</p>

  <p>"Did she understand?"</p>

  <p>"She did not."</p>

  <p>They were silent for some time.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I did wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No. There is mental virtue as well as physical. It is as much your duty
  to protect your sister's mind as to protect her body."</p>

  <p>"I knew you'd think as I do about it; but let me tell you it was an awful
  jolt to the cherished Pennington hospitality. I hope I never have to do it
  again!"</p>

  <p>"I hope you never do."</p>

  <p>He commenced to show increasing signs of suffering, presently, and then he
  asked for morphine.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to take it unless I have to," he explained.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "do not take it unless you have to."</p>

  <p>She prepared and administered it, but she felt no desire for it herself.
  Then Eva came to relieve her, and she bade them good night and went up to
  bed. She awoke about four o'clock in the morning, and immediately thought of
  the little black case; but she only smiled, turned over, and went back to
  sleep again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was several weeks before Custer could ride again, and in
  the meantime Shannon had gone down to her own place to live. She came up
  every day on Baldy, who had been loaned to her until Custer should be able to
  select a horse for her. She insisted that she would own nothing but a Morgan,
  and that she wanted one of the Apache's brothers.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to wait, then, until I can break one for you," Custer told
  her. "There are a couple of four-year-olds that are saddle-broke and
  bridle-wise in a way; but I wouldn't want you to ride either of them until
  they've had the finishing touches. I want to ride them enough to learn their
  faults, if they have any. In the meantime you just keep Baldy down there and
  use him. How's ranching? You look as if it agreed with you. Nobody'd know you
  for the same girl. You look like an Indian, and how your cheeks have filled
  out!"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled happily.</p>

  <p>"I never knew before what it was to live," she said. "I have never been
  sickly; but on the other hand I never <i>felt</i> health before, to know it
  was a tangible, enjoyable possession that one experienced and was conscious
  of every moment. People fill themselves with medicines, or drugs, or liquors,
  to induce temporarily a poor imitation of what they might enjoy constantly if
  they only would. A man who thinks that a drink is the only thing that can
  make one feel like shouting and waving one's hat should throw a leg over one
  of your Morgans before breakfast one of these cool September mornings, and
  give him his head and let him go. Oh, <i>boy!</i>" she cried. <i>"There's</i>
  intoxication for you!"</p>

  <p>Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes dancing. She was a picture of life and
  health and happiness; and Custer's eyes were sparkling, too.</p>

  <p>"Gee!" he exclaimed. "You're a regular Pennington!"</p>

  <p>"I wish I were!" the girl thought to herself. "You honor me," was what she
  said aloud. Custer laughed.</p>

  <p>"That sounded rotten, didn't it? But you know what I meant&mdash;it's nice
  to have people whom we like like the same things we do. It doesn't
  necessarily mean that we think our likes are the best in the world. I didn't
  mean to be egotistical."</p>

  <p>Eva had just entered the patio.</p>

  <p>"Listen to him, the radiant child!" she exclaimed. "Do you know, Shannon,
  that dear little brother just hates himself!"</p>

  <p>She walked over and perched on his knee and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Custer, "brother hates himself. He spends hours powdering his
  nose. Mother found a lipstick and an eyebrow pencil, or whatever you call it,
  in his dressing table recently; and when he goes to L.A. he has his eyebrows
  plucked."</p>

  <p>Eva jumped from his knee and stamped her foot.</p>

  <p>"I <i>never</i> had my eyebrows plucked!" she cried. "They're naturally
  this way."</p>

  <p>"Why the excitement, little one? Did I say you did have them plucked?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you tried to make Shannon think so. I got the lipstick and the
  other things so that if we have any amateur theatricals this winter I'll have
  them. Do you know, I think I'll go on the stage or the screen!&mdash;wouldn't
  it be splishous, though?&mdash;'Miss Eva Pennington is starring in the new
  and popular success based on the story by Guy Thackeray Evans, the eminent
  author!'"</p>

  <p>"Eminent! He isn't even imminent," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Eva!" cried Shannon, genuine concern in her tone. "Surely you
  wouldn't <i>think</i> of the screen, would you? You're not serious?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Custer. "She's serious&mdash;serious is her middle name.
  To-morrow she will want to be a painter, and day after to-morrow the world's
  most celebrated harpist. Eva is nothing if not serious, while her tenacity of
  purpose is absolutely inspiring. Why, once, for one whole day, she wanted to
  do the same thing."</p>

  <p>Eva was laughing with her brother and Shannon.</p>

  <p>"If she were just like every one else, you wouldn't love your little
  sister any more," she said, running her fingers through his hair. "Honestly,
  ever since I met Wilson Crumb, I have thought I should like to be a movie
  star."</p>

  <p>"Wilson Crumb!" exclaimed Shannon. "What do <i>you</i> know of Wilson
  Crumb?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've met him," said Eva airily. "Don't you envy me?"</p>

  <p>"What do you know about him, Shannon?" asked Custer. "Your tone indicated
  that you may have heard something about him that wasn't complimentary."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't know him. It's only what I've heard. I don't think you'd
  like him." Shannon almost shuddered at the thought of this dear child even so
  much as knowing Wilson Crumb.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Eva!" she cried impulsively. "You mustn't even think of going into
  pictures. I lived in Los Angeles long enough to learn that the life is
  oftentimes a hard one, filled with disappointment, disillusionment, and
  regrets&mdash;principally regrets."</p>

  <p>"And Grace is there now," said Custer in a low voice, a worried look in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Can't you persuade her to return?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be fair," he said. "She is trying to succeed, and we ought to
  encourage her. It is probably hard enough for her at best, without all of us
  suggesting antagonism to her ambition by constantly urging her to abandon it,
  so we try to keep our letters cheerful."</p>

  <p>"Have you been to see her since she left? No, I know you haven't. If I
  were you, I'd run down to L.A. It might mean a lot to her, Custer; it might
  mean more than you can guess."</p>

  <p>The girl spoke from a full measure of bitter experience. She realized what
  it might have meant to her had there been some man like this to come to her
  when she had needed the strong arm of a clean love to drag her from the verge
  of the mire. She would have gone away with such a man&mdash;gone back home,
  and thanked God for the opportunity. If Grace loved Custer, and was
  encountering the malign forces that had arisen from their own corruption to
  claw at Shannon's skirts, she would come back with him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, should conditions be what they ought to be, and what
  they are in some studios, Custer would return with a report that would lift a
  load from the hearts of all of them, while it left Grace encouraged and
  inspired by the active support of those most dear to her. What it would mean
  to Shannon, in either event, the girl did not consider. Her soul was above
  jealousy. She was prompted only by a desire to save another from the anguish
  she had endured, and to bring happiness to the man she loved.</p>

  <p>"You really think I ought to go?" Custer asked. "You know she has insisted
  that none of us should come. She said she wanted to do it all on her own,
  without any help. Grace is not only very ambitious, but very proud. I'm
  afraid she might not like it."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't care what she liked," said Shannon. "Either you or Guy should
  run down there and see her. You are the two men most vitally interested in
  her. No girl should be left alone long in Hollywood without some one to whom
  she can look for the right sort of guidance and&mdash;and&mdash;
  protection."</p>

  <p>"I believe I'll do it," said Custer. "I can't get away right now; but I'll
  run down there before I go on to Chicago with the show herds for the
  International."</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was shortly after this that Custer began to ride again,
  and Shannon usually rode with him. Unconsciously he had come to depend upon
  her companionship more and more. He had been drinking less on account of it,
  for it had broken a habit which he had been forming since Grace's
  departure&mdash; that of carrying a flask with him on his lonely rides
  through the hills.</p>

  <p>As a small boy, it had been Custer's duty, as well as his pleasure, to
  "ride fence." He had continued the custom long after it might have been
  assigned to an employee, not only because it had meant long, pleasant hours
  in the saddle with Grace, but also to get first-hand knowledge of the
  condition of the pastures and the herds, as well as of the fences. During his
  enforced idleness, while recovering from his burns, the duty had devolved
  upon Jake.</p>

  <p>On the first day that Custer took up the work again, Jake had called his
  attention to a matter that had long been a subject of discussion and
  conjecture on the part of the employees.</p>

  <p>"There's something funny goin' on back in them hills," said Jake. "I've
  seen fresh signs every week of horses and burros comin' and goin'. Sometimes
  they trail through El Camino Largo and again through Corto, and they've even
  been down through the old goat corral once, plumb through the ranch, an' out
  the west gate. But what I can't tell for sure is whether they come in an' go
  out, or go out an' come in. Whoever does it is foxy. Their two trails never
  cross, an' they must be made within a few hours of each other, for I'm not
  Injun enough to tell which is freshest&mdash;the one comin' to Ganado or the
  one goin' out. An' then they muss it up by draggin' brush, so it's hard to
  tell how many they be of 'em. It's got me."</p>

  <p>"They head for Jackknife, don't they?" asked Custer.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, an' sometimes they go straight up Sycamore, an' again they
  head in or out of half a dozen different little barrancos comin' down from
  the east; but sooner or later I lose 'em&mdash;can't never follow 'em no
  place in particular. Looks like as if they split up."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's only greasers from the valley coming up after firewood at
  night.".</p>

  <p>"Mebbe," said Jake; "but that don't sound reasonable."</p>

  <p>"I know it doesn't; but I can't figure out what else it can be. I found a
  trail up above Jackknife last spring, and maybe that had something to do with
  it. I've sure got to follow that up. The trouble has been that it doesn't
  lead where the stock ever goes, and I haven't had time to look into it. Do
  you think they come up here regularly?"</p>

  <p>"We got it doped out that it's always Friday nights. I see the tracks
  Saturday mornings, and some of the boys say they've heard 'em along around
  midnight a couple of times."</p>

  <p>"What gates do they go out by?"</p>

  <p>"They use all four of 'em at different times."</p>

  <p>"H-m! Padlock all the gates to-morrow. This is Thursday. Then we'll see
  what happens."</p><br>

  <p class="first">They did see, for on the following Saturday, when Custer
  rode fence, he found it cut close by one of the padlocked gates&mdash;the
  gate that opened into the mouth of Horse Camp Cañon. Shannon was with him,
  and she was much excited at this evidence of mystery so close at home.</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you suppose they can be doing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know; but it's something they shouldn't be doing, or they
  wouldn't go to so much pains to cover their tracks. They evidently passed in
  and out at this point, but they've brushed out their tracks on both sides, so
  that you can't tell which way they went last. Look here! On both sides of the
  fence the trail splits. It's hard to say which was made first, and where they
  passed through the fence. One track must have been on top of the other, but
  they've brushed it out."</p>

  <p>He had dismounted, and was on his knees, examining the spoor beyond the
  fence.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said presently, "that the fresher trail is the one going
  toward the hills, although the other one is heavier. Here's a rabbit track
  that lies on top of the track of a horse's hoof pointed toward the valley,
  and over here a few yards the same rabbit track is obliterated by the track
  of horses and burros coming up from the valley. The rabbit must have come
  across here after they went down, stepping on top of their tracks, and when
  they came up again they crossed on top of his. That's pretty plain, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but the tracks going down are much plainer than those going up.
  Wouldn't that indicate that they were fresher?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I thought until I saw this evidence introduced by Brer
  Rabbit&mdash;and it's conclusive, too. Let's look along here a little
  farther. I have an idea that I have an idea."</p>

  <p>"One of Eva's 'dapper little ideas,' perhaps!"</p>

  <p>He bent close above first one trail and then another, following them down
  toward the valley. Shannon walked beside him, leading Baldy. Sometimes, as
  they knelt above the evidence imprinted in the dusty soil, their shoulders
  touched. The contact thrilled the girl with sweet delight, and the fact that
  it left him cold did not sadden her. She knew that he was not for her. It was
  enough that she might be near him and love him. She did not want him to love
  her&mdash; that would have been the final tragedy of her life.</p>

  <p>For the most part the trail was obliterated by brush, which seemed to have
  been dragged behind the last horse; but here and there was the imprint of the
  hoof of a horse, or, again, of a burro, so that the story that Custer pieced
  out was reasonably clear&mdash;as far as it went.</p>

  <p>"I think I've got a line on it," he said presently. "Two men rode along
  here on horses. One horse was shod, the other was not. One rider went ahead,
  the other brought up the rear, and between them were several burros. Going
  down, the burros carried heavy loads; coming back, they carried
  nothing.".</p>

  <p>"How do you know all that?" she asked rather incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I don't <i>know</i> it, but it seems the most logical deduction from
  these tracks. It is easy to tell the horse tracks from those of the burros,
  and to tell that there were at least two horses, because it is plain that a
  shod horse and an unshod horse passed along here. That one horse&mdash;the
  one with shoes&mdash;went first is evident from the fact that you always see
  the imprints of burro hoofs, or the hoofs of an unshod horse, or both
  superimposed on his. That the other horse brought up the rear in equally
  plain from the fact that no other tracks lie on top of his. Now, if you will
  look close, and compare several of these horse tracks, you will notice that
  there is little or no difference in the appearance of those leading into the
  valley and those leading out; but you can see that the burro tracks leading
  down are more deeply imprinted than those leading up. To me that means that
  those burros carried heavy loads down and came back light. How does it
  sound?"</p>

  <p>"It's wonderful!" she exclaimed. "It is all that I can do to see that
  anything has been along here."</p>

  <p>"It's not wonderful," he replied. "An experienced tracker would tell you
  how many horses there were, how many burros, how many hours had elapsed since
  they came down out of the hills, how many since they returned, and the names
  of the grandmothers of both riders."</p>

  <p>Shannon laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're not an experienced tracker, then," she said, "for now I
  can believe what you have told me. And I still think it very wonderful, and
  very delightful, too, to be able to read stories&mdash;true stories&mdash;in
  the trampled dust where men and animals have passed."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing very remarkable about it. Just look at the Apache's
  hoofprints, for instance. See how the hind differ from the fore."</p>

  <p>Custer pointed to them as he spoke, calling attention to the fact that the
  Apache's hind shoes were squared off at the toe.</p>

  <p>"And now compare them with Baldy's," he said. "See how different the two
  hoofprints are. Once you know them, you could never confuse one with the
  other. But the part of the story that would interest me most I can't
  read&mdash;who they are, what they were packing out of the hills on these
  burros, where they came from, and where they went. Let's follow down and see
  where they went in the valley. The trail must pass right by the Evanses' hay
  barn."</p>

  <p>The Evanses' hay barn! A great light illuminated Shannon's memory. Allen
  had said, that last night at the bungalow, that the contraband whisky was
  hauled away on a truck, that it was concealed beneath hay, and that a young
  man named Evans handled it.</p>

  <p>What was she to do? She dared not reveal this knowledge to Custer, because
  she could not explain how she came into possession of it. Nor, for the same
  reason, could she warn Guy Evans, had she thought that necessary&mdash;which
  she was sure it was not, since Custer would not expose him. She concluded
  that all she could do was to let events take their own course.</p>

  <p>She followed Custer as he traced the partially obliterated tracks through
  a field of barley stubble. A hundred yards west of the hay barn the trail
  entered a macadam road at right angles, and there it disappeared. There was
  no telling whether the little caravan had turned east or west, for it left no
  spoor upon the hard surface of the paved road.</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>Watson!</i>" said Custer, turning to her with a grin. "What do
  you make of this?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing? <i>Watson</i>, I am surprised. Neither do I." He turned his
  horse back toward the cut fence. "There's no use looking any farther in this
  direction. I don't know that it's even worth while following the trail back
  into the hills, for the chances are that they have it well covered. What I'll
  do is to lay for them next Friday night. Maybe they're not up to any
  mischief, but it looks suspicious; and if they are, I'd rather catch them
  here with the goods than follow them up into the hills, where about all I'd
  accomplish would probably be to warn them that they were being watched. I'm
  sorry now I had those gates locked, for it will have put them on their guard.
  We'll just fix up this fence, and then we'll ride about and take all the
  locks off."</p><br>

  <p class="first">On the way home, an hour later, he asked Shannon not to say
  anything about their discovery or his plan to watch for the mysterious pack
  train the following Friday.</p>

  <p>"It would only excite the folks needlessly," he explained. "The chances
  are that there'll be some simple explanation when I meet up with these
  people. As I told Jake, they may be greasers who work all the week and come
  up here at night for firewood. Still more likely, it's people who don't know
  they can get permission to gather deadwood for the asking, and think they are
  stealing it. Putting themselves to a lot of trouble for nothing, I'll
  say!"</p>

  <p>"You'll not wait for them alone?" she asked, for she knew what he did
  not&mdash;that they were probably unscrupulous rascals who would not hesitate
  to commit any crime if they thought themselves in danger of discovery.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked. "I only want to ask them what they are doing on
  Ganado, and why they cut our fence."</p>

  <p>"Please don't!" she begged. "You don't know who they are or what they have
  been doing. They might be very desperate men, for all we know."</p>

  <p>"All right," he agreed. "I'll take Jake with me."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you get Guy to go along, too?" she suggested, for she knew that
  he would be safer if Guy knew of his intention, since then there would be
  little likelihood of his meeting the men.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "Guy would have to have a big camp fire, an easy chair,
  and a package of cigarettes if he was going to sit up that late out in the
  hills. Jake's the best for that sort of work."</p>

  <p>"Guy isn't a bit like you, is he?" she asked. "He's lived right here and
  led the same sort of life, and yet he doesn't seem to be a part of it, as you
  are."</p>

  <p>"Guy's a dreamer, and he likes to be comfortable all the time," laughed
  Custer. "They're all that way a little. Mr. Evans was, so father says. He
  died while we were all kids. Mrs. Evans likes to take it easy, too, and even
  Grace wasn't much on roughing it, though she could stand more than the
  others. None of them seemed to take to it the way you do. I never saw any one
  else but a Pennington such a glutton for a saddle and the outdoors as you
  are. I don't like 'em any the less for it," he hastened to add. "It's just
  the way people are, I guess. The taste for such things is inherited. The
  Evanses, up to this generation, all came from the city; the Penningtons all
  from the country. Father thinks that horsemen, if not the descendants of a
  distinct race, at least spring from some common ancestors who inhabited great
  plains and were the original stock raisers of the human race. He thinks they
  mingled with the hill and mountain people, who also became horsemen through
  them; but that the forest tribes and the maritime races were separate and
  distinct. It was the last who built the cities, which the horsemen came in
  from the plains and conquered."</p>

  <p>"But perhaps Guy would like the adventure of it," she insisted. "It might
  give him material for a story. I'm going to ask him."</p>

  <p>"Please don't. The less said about it the better, for if it's talked about
  it may get to the men I want to catch. Word travels fast in the country. Just
  as we don't know who these men are or what they are doing, neither do we know
  but what some of them may be on friendly terms with our employees, or the
  Evanses, or yours."</p>

  <p>The girl made no reply.</p>

  <p>"You won't mention it to him, please?" Custer insisted.</p>

  <p>"Not if you don't wish it," she said.</p>

  <p>They were silent for a time, each absorbed in his or her own thoughts. The
  girl was seeking to formulate some plan that would prevent a meeting between
  Custer and Allen's confederates, who she was sure were the owners of the
  mysterious pack train; while the man indulged in futile conjectures as to
  their identity and the purpose of their nocturnal expeditions.</p>

  <p>"That trail above Jackknife Cañon is the key to the whole business," he
  declared presently. "I'll just lay low until after next Friday night, so as
  not to arouse their suspicions, and then, no matter what I find out, I'll
  ride that trail to its finish, if it takes me clear to the ocean!"</p>

  <p>They had reached the fork in the road, one branch of which led down to
  Shannon's bungalow, the other to the Ganado saddle-horse stables.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were coming up to lunch," said Custer, as Shannon reined
  her horse into the west road.</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," she said. "I'll come to dinner, if I may, though."</p>

  <p>"We all miss you when you're not there," he said.</p>

  <p>"How nice! Now I'll surely come."</p>

  <p>"And this afternoon&mdash;will you ride with me again?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be very busy this afternoon," she replied.</p>

  <p>His face dropped, and then, almost immediately, he laughed.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't realized how much of your time I have been demanding. Why, you
  ride with me every day, and now when you want an afternoon off I start
  moping. I'm afraid you've spoiled me; but you mustn't let me be a
  nuisance."</p>

  <p>"I ride with you because I like to," she replied. "I should miss our rides
  terribly if anything should occur to prevent them."</p>

  <p>"Let's hope nothing will prevent them. I'm afraid I'd be lost without you
  now, Shannon. You can never know what it has meant to me to have you here. I
  was sort of going to pot after Grace left&mdash;blue and discouraged and
  discontented; and I was drinking too much. I don't mind telling you, because
  I know you'll understand&mdash;you seem to understand everything. Having you
  to ride with and talk to pulled me together. I owe you a lot, so don't let me
  impose on your friendship and your patience. Any time you want an afternoon
  off," he concluded, laughing, "don't be afraid to ask for it&mdash;I'll see
  that you get it with full pay!"</p>

  <p>"I don't <i>want</i> any afternoons off, because I enjoy the rides as much
  as you, and they have meant even more to me. I intend to see that nothing
  prevents them, if I can."</p>

  <p>She was touched and pleased with Custer's sudden burst of confidence, and
  thankful for whatever had betrayed him into one of those rare revelations of
  his heart. She wanted to be necessary to him, in the sweet and unemotional
  way of friendship, so that they might be together without embarrassment or
  constraint.</p>

  <p>They had been standing at the fork, talking, and now, as she started Baldy
  again in the direction of her own place, Custer reined the Apache to
  accompany her.</p>

  <p>"You needn't come down with me," she said. "It's nearly lunch time now,
  and it would only make you late."</p>

  <p>"But I want to."</p>

  <p>"No!" She shook her head. "You go right home."</p>

  <p>"Please!"</p>

  <p>"This is my afternoon off," she reminded him, "and I'd really rather you
  wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"All right! I'll drive down in the car early, and we'll have a swim before
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"Not too early&mdash;I'll telephone you when I'm ready. Good- by!"</p>

  <p>He waved his hat as she cantered off, and then sat the Apache for a
  moment, watching her. How well she rode! What grace and ease in every motion
  of that supple body! He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Some girl, Shannon!" he mused aloud as he wheeled the Apache and rode
  toward the stables.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SHANNON BURKE did not ride to her home after she left
  Custer. She turned toward the west at the road above the Evans place,
  continued on to the mouth of Horse Camp Cañon, and entered the hills. For two
  miles she followed the cañon trail to El Camino Largo, and there, turning to
  the left, she followed this other trail east to Sycamore Cañon. Whatever her
  mission, it was evident that she did not wish it known to others. Had she not
  wished to conceal it, she might have ridden directly up Sycamore Cañon from
  Ganado with a saving of several miles.</p>

  <p>Crossing Sycamore, she climbed the low hills skirting its eastern side.
  There was no trail here, and the brush was thick and oftentimes so dense that
  she was forced to make numerous detours to find a way upward; but at last she
  rode out upon the western rim of the basin meadow above Jackknife. Thence she
  picked her way down to more level ground, and, putting spurs to Baldy,
  galloped east, her eyes constantly scanning the ground just ahead of her.</p>

  <p>Presently she found what she sought&mdash;a trail running north and south
  across the basin. She turned Baldy into it, and headed him south toward the
  mountains. She was nervous and inwardly terrified, and a dozen times she
  would have turned back had she not been urged on by a power infinitely more
  potent than self-interest.</p>

  <p>Personally, she had all to lose by the venture and naught to gain. The
  element of physical danger she knew to be far from inconsiderable, while it
  appalled her to contemplate the after effects, in the not inconceivable
  contingency of the discovery of her act by the Penningtons.</p>

  <p>Yet she urged Baldy steadily onward, though she felt her flesh creep as
  the trail entered a narrow barranco at the southern extremity of the meadow
  and wound upward through dense chaparral, which shut off her range of vision
  in all directions for more than a few feet.</p>

  <p>At the upper end of the barranco the trail turned back and ascended a
  steep hillside, running diagonally upward through heavy brush&mdash;without
  which, she realized, the trail would have appeared an almost impossible one,
  since it clung to a nearly perpendicular cliff. The brush lent a suggestion
  of safety that was more apparent than real, and at the same time it hid the
  sheer descent below.</p>

  <p>Baldy, digging his toes into the loose earth, scrambled upward, stepping
  over gnarled roots and an occasional boulder, and finding, almost
  miraculously, the least precarious footing. There were times when the girl
  shut her eyes tightly and sat with tensed muscles, her knees pressing her
  horse's sides until her muscles ached. At last the doughty Morgan topped the
  summit of the hogback, and Shannon drew a deep breath of relief&mdash;which
  was alloyed, however, by the realization that in returning she must ride down
  this frightful trail, which now, as if by magic, disappeared.</p>

  <p>The hogback was water-washed and gravel-strewn, and as hard-baked beneath
  the summer's sun as a macadam road. To Shannon's unaccustomed eyes it gave no
  clue as to the direction of the trail. She rode up and down in both
  directions until finally she discovered what appeared to be a trail leading
  downward into another barranco upon the opposite side of the ridge. The
  descent seemed less terrifying than that which she had just negotiated, and
  as it was the only indication of a trail that she could find, she determined
  to investigate it.</p>

  <p>Baldy, descending carefully, suddenly paused and with uppricked ears
  emitted a shrill neigh. So sudden and so startling was the sound that
  Shannon's heart all but stood still, gripped by the cold fingers of terror.
  And then from below came an answering neigh.</p>

  <p>She had found what she sought, but the fear that rode her all but sent her
  panic-stricken in retreat. It was only the fact that she could not turn Baldy
  upon that narrow trail that gave her sufficient pause to gain mastery over
  the chaos of her nerves and drive them again into the fold of reason. It
  required a supreme effort of will to urge her horse onward again, down into
  that mysterious ravine, where she knew there might lurk for her a thing more
  terrible than death. That she did it bespoke the greatness of the love that
  inspired her courage.</p>

  <p>The ravine below her was both shallower and wider than that upon the
  opposite side of the ridge, so that it presented the appearance of a tiny
  basin. From her vantage point she looked out across the tops of spreading
  oaks to the brush-covered hillside that bounded the basin on the south; but
  what lay below, what the greenery of the trees concealed from her sight, she
  could only surmise.</p>

  <p>She knew that the Penningtons kept no horses here, so she guessed that the
  animal that had answered Baldy's neigh belonged to the men she sought. Slowly
  she rode downward. What would her reception be? If her conclusions as to the
  identity of the men camped below were correct, she could imagine them
  shooting first and investigating later. The idea was not a pleasant one, but
  nothing could deter her now.</p>

  <p>After what seemed a long time she rode out among splendid old oaks, in
  view of a soiled tent and a picket line where three horses and a half dozen
  burros were tethered. Nowhere was there sign of the actual presence of men,
  yet she had an uncanny feeling that they were there, and that from some place
  of concealment they were watching her.</p>

  <p>She sat quietly upon her horse for a moment, waiting. Then, no one
  appearing, she called aloud.</p>

  <p>"Hello, there! I want to speak with you."</p>

  <p>Her voice sounded strange and uncanny in her ears.</p>

  <p>For what seemed a long time there was no other sound than the gently
  moving leaves about her, the birds, and the heavy breathing of Baldy. Then,
  from the brush behind her, came another voice. It came from the direction of
  the trail down which she had ridden. She realized that she must have passed
  within a few feet of the man who now spoke.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I have come to warn you. You are being watched."</p>

  <p>"You mean you are not alone? There are others with you? Then tell them to
  go away, for we have our rifles. We have done nothing We're tending our
  bees&mdash;they're just below the ridge above our camp."</p>

  <p>"There is no one with me. I do not mean that others are watching you now,
  but that others know that you come down out of the hills with something each
  Friday night, and they want to find out what it is you bring."</p>

  <p>There was a rustling in the brush behind her, and she turned to see a man
  emerge, carrying a rifle ready in his hands. He was a Mexican, swarthy and
  ill-favored, his face pitted by smallpox.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately two other men stepped from the brush at other points
  about the camp. The three walked to where Shannon sat upon her mount All were
  armed, and all were Mexicans.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about what we bring out of the hills? Should we not
  bring our honey out?" asked the pock-marked one.</p>

  <p>"I know what you bring out," she said. "I am not going to expose you. I am
  here to warn you."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I know Allen."</p>

  <p>Immediately their attitude changed. "You have seen Allen? You bring a
  message from him?"</p>

  <p>"I have not seen him. I bring no message from him; but for reasons of my
  own I have come to warn you not to bring down another load next Friday
  night."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE pock-marked Mexican stepped close to Shannon and took
  hold of her bridle reins.</p>

  <p>"You think," he said in broken English, "we are damn fool? If you do not
  come from Allen, you come for no good to us. You tell us the truth, damn
  quick, or you never go back to tell where you find us and bring policemen
  here!"</p>

  <p>His tone was ugly and his manner threatening. There was no harm in telling
  these men the truth, though it was doubtful whether they would believe her.
  She realized that she was in a predicament from which it might not be easy to
  extricate herself. She had told them that she was alone, and if they
  suspected her motives they might easily do away with her. She knew how
  lightly the criminal Mexican esteems life&mdash;especially the life of the
  hated gringo.</p>

  <p>"I have come to warn you because a friend of mine is going to watch for
  you next Friday night. He does not now who you are, or what you bring out of
  the hills. I do, and so I know that rather than be caught you might kill him,
  and I do not want him killed. That is all."</p>

  <p>"How do you know what we bring out of the hills?"</p>

  <p>"Allen told me."</p>

  <p>"Allen told you? I do not believe you. Do you know where Allen is?"</p>

  <p>"He is in jail in Los Angeles. I heard him telling a man in Los Angeles
  last July."</p>

  <p>"Who is the friend of yours that is going to watch for us?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pennington."</p>

  <p>"You have told him about us?"</p>

  <p>"I have told you that he knows nothing about you. All he knows is that
  some one comes down with burros from the hills, and that they cut his fence
  last Friday night. He wants to catch you and find out what you are
  doing."</p>

  <p>"Why have you not told him?" She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"That can make no difference," she said presently.</p>

  <p>"It makes a difference to us. I told you to tell the truth, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Mexican raised his rifle that she might guess the rest.</p>

  <p>"I did not want to have to explain how I knew about you. I did not want
  Mr. Pennington to know that I knew such men as Allen.</p>

  <p>"How did you know Allen?"</p>

  <p>"That has nothing to do with it at all. I have warned you so that you can
  take steps to avoid discovery and capture. I shall tell no one else about
  you. Now let me go."</p>

  <p>She gathered Baldy and tried to rein him about, but the man clung to her
  bridle.</p>

  <p>"Not so much of a hurry, <i>señorita!</i> Unless I know how Allen told you
  so much, I cannot believe that he told you anything. The police have many
  ways of learning things&mdash; sometimes they use women. If you are a friend
  to Allen, all right. It you are not, you know too damn much for to be very
  good for your health. You had better tell me all the truth, or you shall not
  ride away from here&mdash;ever!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "I met Allen in a house in Hollywood where he sold
  his 'snow' and I heard him telling the man there how you disposed of the
  whisky that was stolen in New York, brought here to the coast in a ship, and
  hidden in the mountains."</p>

  <p>"What is the name of the man in whose house you met Allen?"</p>

  <p>"Crumb."</p>

  <p>The man raised his heavy brows. "How long since you been there&mdash;in
  that house in Hollywood?"</p>

  <p>"Not since the last of July. I left the house the same time Allen
  did."</p>

  <p>"You know how Allen he get in jail?" the Mexican asked.</p>

  <p>The girl saw that a new suspicion had been aroused in the man, and she
  judged that the safer plan was to be perfectly frank.</p>

  <p>"I do not know, for I have seen neither Crumb nor Allen since; but when I
  read in the paper that he had been arrested that night, I guessed that Crumb
  had done it. I heard Crumb ask him to deliver some snow to a man in
  Hollywood. I know that Crumb is a bad man, and that he was trying to steal
  your share of the money from Allen."</p>

  <p>The man thought in silence for several minutes, the lines of his heavy
  face evidencing the travail with which some new idea was being born.
  Presently he looked up, the light of cunning gleaming in his evil eyes.</p>

  <p>"You go now," he said. "I know you! Allen tell me about you a long time
  ago. You Crumb's woman, and your name is Gaza. You will not tell anything
  about us to your rich friends the Penningtons&mdash;you bet you won't!"</p>

  <p>The Mexican laughed loudly, winking at his companions.</p>

  <p>Shannon could feel the burning flush that suffused her face. She closed
  her eyes in what was almost physical pain, so terrible did the humiliation
  torture her pride, and then came the nausea of disgust. The man had dropped
  her reins, and she wheeled Baldy about.</p>

  <p>"You will not come Friday night?" she asked, wishing some assurance that
  her sacrifice had not been entirely unavailing.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pennington will not find us Friday night, and so he will not be
  shot."</p>

  <p>She rode away then; but there was a vague suspicion lurking in her mind
  that there had been a double meaning in the man's final words.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Custer Pennington, occupied in the office for a couple of
  hours after lunch, had just come from the house, and was standing on the brow
  of the hill looking out over the ranch toward the mountains. His gaze,
  wandering idly at first, was suddenly riveted upon a tiny speck moving
  downward from the mouth of a distant ravine&mdash;a moving speck which he
  recognized, even at that distance, to be a horseman, where no horseman should
  have been. For a moment he watched it, and then, returning to the house, he
  brought out a pair of binoculars.</p>

  <p>Now the speck had disappeared; but he knew that it was down in the bottom
  of the basin, hidden by the ridge above Jackknife Cañon, and he waited for
  the time when it would reappear on the crest. For five, ten, fifteen minutes
  he watched the spot where the rider should come into view once more. Then he
  saw a movement in the brush and leveled his glasses upon the spot, following
  the half seen figure until it emerged into a space clear of chaparral. Now
  they were clearly revealed by the powerful lenses, the horse and its
  rider&mdash;Baldy and Shannon!</p>

  <p>Pennington dropped the glasses at his side, a puzzled expression on his
  face, as he tried to find some explanation of the fact that the binoculars
  had revealed. From time to time he caught glimpses of her again as she rode
  down the cañon; but when, after a considerable time, she did not emerge upon
  the road leading to the house, he guessed that she had crossed over El Camino
  Corto. Why she should do this he could not even conjecture. It was entirely
  out of her way, and a hilly trail, while the other was a wagon road leading
  almost directly from Sycamore to her house.</p>

  <p>Presently he walked around the house to the north side of the hill, where
  he had a view of the valley spreading to the east and the west and the north.
  Toward the west he could see the road that ran above the Evanses' house all
  the way to Horse Camp Cañon.</p>

  <p>He did not know why he stood there watching for Shannon. It was none of
  his affair where she rode, or when. It seemed strange, though, that she
  should have ridden alone into the hills after having refused to ride with
  him. It surprised him, and troubled him, too, for it was the first suggestion
  that Shannon could commit even the most trivial act of underhandedness.</p>

  <p>After a while he saw her emerge from Horse Camp Cañon and follow the road
  to her own place. Custer ran his fingers through his hair in perplexity. He
  was troubled not only because Shannon had ridden without him, after telling
  him that she could not ride that afternoon, but also because of the direction
  in which she had ridden&mdash;the trail of which he had told her that he
  thought it led to the solution of the mystery of the nocturnal traffic. He
  had told her that he would not ride it before Saturday, for fear of arousing
  the suspicions of the men he wished to surprise in whatever activity they
  might be engaged upon; and within a few hours she had ridden deliberately up
  into the mountains on that very trail.</p>

  <p>The more Custer considered the matter, the more perplexed he became. At
  last he gave it up in sheer disgust. Doubtless Shannon would tell him all
  about it when he called for her later in the afternoon. He tried to forget
  it; but the thing would not be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Several times he realized, with surprise, that he was hurt because she had
  ridden without him. He tried to argue that he was not hurt, that it made no
  difference to him, that she had a perfect right to ride with or without him
  as she saw fit, and that he did not care a straw one way or the other.</p>

  <p>No, it was not that that was troubling him&mdash;it was something else. He
  didn't know what it was, but a drink would straighten it out; so he took a
  drink. He realized that it was the first he had had in a week, and almost
  decided not to take it; but he changed his mind. After that he took several
  more without bothering his conscience to any appreciable extent. When his
  conscience showed signs of life, he reasoned it back to innocuous desuetude
  by that unanswerable argument: "What's the use?"</p>

  <p>By the time he left to call for Shannon he was miserably happy and happily
  miserable; yet he showed no outward sign that he had been drinking, unless it
  was that he swung the roadster around the curves of the driveway leading down
  the hill a bit more rapidly than usual.</p>

  <p>Shannon was ready and waiting for him. She came out to the car with a
  smile&mdash;a smile that hid a sad and frightened heart; and he greeted her
  with another that equally belied his inward feelings. As they rode up to the
  castle on the hill, he gave her every opportunity to mention and explain her
  ride, principally by long silences, though never by any outward indication
  that he thought she had aught to explain. If she did not care to have him
  know about it, she should never know from him that he already knew; but the
  canker of suspicion was already gnawing at his heart, and he was realizing,
  perhaps for the first time, how very desirable this new friendship had grown
  to be.</p>

  <p>Again and again he insisted to himself that what she had done made no
  difference&mdash;that she must have had some excellent reason. Perhaps she
  had just wanted to be alone. He often had experienced a similar longing. Even
  when Grace had been there, he had occasionally wanted to ride off into the
  hills with nothing but his own thoughts for company.</p>

  <p>Yet, argue as he would, the fact remained that it had made a difference,
  and that he was considering Shannon now in a new light. Just what the change
  meant he probably could not have satisfactorily explained, had he tried; but
  he did not try. He knew that there was a difference, and that his heart ached
  when it should not ache. It made him angry with himself, with the result that
  he went to his room and had another drink.</p>

  <p>Shannon, too, felt the difference. She thought that it was her own guilty
  conscience, though why she should feel guilt for having risked so much for
  his sake she did not know. Instinctively she was honest, and so to deceive
  one whom she loved, even for a good purpose, troubled her.</p>

  <p>Something else troubled her, too. She knew that Custer had been drinking
  again, and she recalled what he had said to her, that morning, of the help
  she had been to him in getting away from his habit. She knew too well herself
  what it meant to fight for freedom from a settled vice, and she had been glad
  to have been instrumental in aiding him. She had had to fight her own battle
  alone; she did not want him to face a similar ordeal.</p>

  <p>She wondered why he had been drinking that afternoon. Could it have been
  because she had not been able to ride with him, and thus left alone he had
  reverted to the old habit? The girl reproached herself, even though she felt,
  after her interview with the Mexicans, that she had undoubtedly saved
  Custer's life.</p>

  <p>The Evanses, mother and son, were also at the Penningtons' for dinner that
  night. Shannon had noticed that it was with decreasing frequency that Grace's
  name was mentioned of late. She knew the reason. Letters had become fewer and
  fewer from the absent girl. She had practically ceased writing to Custer. Her
  letters to Mrs. Evans were no longer read to the Penningtons, for there had
  crept into them a new and unpleasant note that was as foreign as possible to
  the girl who had gone away months before. They showed a certain carelessness
  and lack of consideration that had pained them all.</p>

  <p>They always asked after the absent girl, but her present life and her
  career were no longer discussed, since the subject brought nothing but sorrow
  to them all. That she had been disappointed and disillusioned seemed
  probable, since she had obtained only a few minor parts in mediocre pictures;
  and now she no longer mentioned her ambition, and scarcely ever wrote of her
  work.</p>

  <p>At dinner that night Eva was unusually quiet until the colonel, noticing
  it, asked if she was ill.</p>

  <p>"There!" she cried. "You all make life miserable for me because I talk too
  much, and then, when I give you a rest, you ask if I am ill. What shall I do?
  If I talk, I pain you. If I fail to talk, I pain you; but if you must know, I
  am too thrilled to talk just now&mdash;I am going to be married!"</p>

  <p>"All alone?" inquired Custer.</p>

  <p>A sickly purplish hue, threatening crimson complications, crept from
  beneath Guy's collar and enveloped his entire head. He reached for his water
  goblet and ran the handle of his fork up his sleeve. The ensuing
  disentanglement added nothing to his equanimity, though it all but overturned
  the goblet. Custer was eying him with a seraphic expression that boded
  ill.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Guy&mdash;measles?" he asked with a beatific
  smile.</p>

  <p>Guy grinned sheepishly, and was about to venture an explanation when Eva
  interrupted him. The others at the table were watching the two with amused
  smiles.</p>

  <p>"You see, momsy," said Eva, addressing her mother, "Guy has sold a story.
  He got a thousand dollars for it&mdash;a thousand!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not a thousand!" expostulated Guy.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was nearly a thousand&mdash;if it had been three hundred dollars
  more it would have been&mdash;and so now that our future is assured we are
  going to be married. I hadn't intended to mention it until Guy had talked
  with popsy, but this will be very much nicer, and easier for Guy."</p>

  <p>Guy looked up appealingly at the colonel.</p>

  <p>"You see, sir, I was summing to key you&mdash;I mean I was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You see what it is going to mean to have an author in the family," said
  Custer. "He's going to talk away above our heads. We won't know what he's
  talking about half the time. I don't know. Do you, Guy?"</p>

  <p>"For pity's sake, Custer, leave the boy alone!" laughed Mrs. Pennington.
  "You're enough to rattle a stone image. And now, Guy, you know you don't have
  to feel embarrassed. We have all grown accustomed to the idea that you and
  Eva would marry, so it is no surprise. It makes us very happy."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Pennington," said the boy. "It wasn't that it was hard to
  tell you. It was the way Eva wanted me to do it&mdash;like a book. I was
  supposed to come and ask the colonel for her hand in a very formal manner,
  and it made me feel foolish, the more I thought of it&mdash;and I have been
  thinking about it all day. So, you see, when Eva blurted it out, I thought of
  my silly speech and I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a silly speech," interrupted Eva. "It was simplimetic
  gorgeristic. You thought so yourself when you made <i>Bruce Bellinghame</i>
  ask <i>Hortense's</i> father for her. 'Mr. Le Claire,' he said, squaring his
  manly shoulders, 'it is with emotions of deepest solemnity and a full
  realization of my unworthiness that I approach you upon this beautiful day in
  May&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake, Eva, <i>please!</i>" begged Guy.</p>

  <p>They were all laughing now, including Eva and Guy. The tears were rolling
  down Custer's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"That editor was guilty of grand larceny when he offered you seven hundred
  berries for the story. Why, the gem alone is easily worth a thousand. Adieu,
  Mark Twain! Farewell, Bill Nye! You've got 'em all nailed to the post, Guy
  Thackeray!"</p>

  <p>The colonel wiped his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I gather," he said, "that you two children wish to get married. Do I
  surmise correctly?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, popsy, you're just wonderful!" exclaimed Eva.</p>

  <p>"Yes, how did you guess it, father?" asked Custer. "Marvelous deductive
  faculties for an old gentleman, I'll say!"</p>

  <p>"That will be about all from you, Custer," admonished the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Any time that I let a chance like this slip!" returned young Pennington.
  "Do you think I have forgotten how those two imps pestered the life out of
  Grace and me a few short years ago? Nay, nay!"</p>

  <p>"I don't blame Custer a bit," said Mrs. Evans. "Guy and Eva certainly did
  make life miserable for him and Grace."</p>

  <p>"That part of it is all right&mdash;it is Guy's affair and Eva's; but did
  you hear him refer to me as an old gentleman?"</p>

  <p>They all laughed.</p>

  <p>"But you <i>are</i> a gentleman," insisted Custer.</p>

  <p>The colonel, his eyes twinkling, turned to Mrs. Evans.</p>

  <p>"Times have changed, Mae, since we were children. Imagine speaking thus to
  our fathers!"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad they have changed, Custer. It's terrible to see children afraid
  of their parents. It has driven so many of them away from home."</p>

  <p>"No danger of that here," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"It is more likely to be the other way around," suggested Mrs. Pennington.
  "In the future we may hear of parents leaving home because of the exacting
  tyranny of their children."</p>

  <p>"My children shall be brought up properly," announced Eva, "with proper
  respect for their elders."</p>

  <p>"Guided by the shining example of their mother," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"And their Uncle Cutie," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"Come, now," interrupted the colonel, "let's hear something about your
  plans. When are you going to be married?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," offered Custer. "Now that the seven hundred dollars has assured
  their future, there is no reason why they shouldn't be married at once and
  take a suite at the Ambassador. I understand they're as low as thirty-five
  hundred a month."</p>

  <p>"Aw, I have more than the seven hundred," said Guy. "I've been saving up
  for a long time. We'll have plenty to start with."</p>

  <p>Shannon noticed that he flushed just a little as he made the statement,
  and she alone knew why he flushed. It was too bad that Custer's little sister
  should start her married life on money of that sort!</p>

  <p>Shannon felt that at heart Guy was a good boy&mdash;that he must have been
  led into this traffic originally without any adequate realization of its
  criminality. Her own misfortune had made her generously ready to seek excuses
  for wrongdoing in others; but she dreaded to think what it was going to mean
  to Eva and the other Penningtons if ever the truth became known. From her
  knowledge of the sort of men with whom Guy was involved, she was inclined to
  believe that the menace of exposure or blackmail would hang over him for many
  years, even if the former did not materialize in the near future; for she was
  confident that if his confederates were discovered by the authorities, they
  would immediately involve him, and would try to put the full burden of
  responsibility upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't want the financial end of matrimony to worry either of you," the
  colonel was saying. "Guy has chosen a profession in which it may require
  years of effort to produce substantial returns. All I shall ask of my
  daughter's husband is that he shall honestly apply himself to his work. If
  you do your best, Guy, you will succeed, and in the meantime I'll take care
  of the finances."</p>

  <p>"But we don't want it that way," said Eva. "We don't want to live on
  charity."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that what I give to my little girl would be given in a
  spirit of charity?" the colonel asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, popsy, I know you wouldn't feel that it was; but can't you see how
  Guy would feel? I want him to be independent. I'd rather get along with a
  little, and feel that he had earned it all."</p>

  <p>"It may take a long time, Eva," said Custer; "and in the meantime the best
  part of your lives would be spent in worry and scrimping. I know how you
  feel; but there's a way around it that has the backing of established
  business methods. Let father finance Guy's writing ability, just as inventive
  genius is sometimes financed. When Guy succeeds, he can pay back with
  interest."</p>

  <p>"What a dapper little thought!" exclaimed the girl. "That would fix
  everything, wouldn't it? You radiant man!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the following Monday a pock-marked Mexican appeared at
  the county jail in Los Angeles, during visitors' hours, and asked to be
  permitted to see Slick Allen. The two stood in a corner and conversed in
  whispers. Allen's face wore an ugly scowl when his visitor told him of young
  Pennington's interference with their plans.</p>

  <p>"It's getting too hot for us around there," said Allen. "We got to move.
  How much junk you got left?"</p>

  <p>"About sixty cases of booze. We got rid of nearly three hundred cases on
  the coast side, without sending 'em through Evans. There isn't much of the
  other junk left&mdash;a couple pounds altogether, at the outside."</p>

  <p>"We got to lose the last of the booze," said Allen; "but we'll get our
  money's worth out of it. Now you listen, and listen careful, Bartolo."</p>

  <p>He proceeded very carefully and explicitly to explain the details of a
  plan which brought a grin of sinister amusement to the face of the Mexican.
  It was not an entirely new plan, but rather an elaboration and improvement of
  one that Allen had conceived some time before in the event of a contingency
  similar to that which had now arisen.</p>

  <p>"And what about the girl?" asked Bartolo. "She should pay well to keep the
  Penningtons from knowing."</p>

  <p>"Leave her to me," replied Allen. "I shall not be in jail
  forever."</p><br>

  <p class="first">During the ensuing days of that late September week, when
  Shannon and Custer rode together, there was a certain constraint in their
  relations that was new and depressing. The girl was apprehensive of the
  outcome of his adventure on the rapidly approaching Friday, while he could
  not rid himself of the haunting memory of her solitary and clandestine ride
  over the mysterious trail that led into the mountains.</p>

  <p>It troubled him that she should have kept the thing a secret, and it
  troubled him that he should care. What difference could it make to him where
  Shannon Burke rode? He asked himself that question a hundred times; but
  though he always answered that it could make no difference, he knew perfectly
  well that it <i>had</i> made a difference.</p>

  <p>He often found himself studying her face, as if he would find there either
  an answer to his question, or a refutation of the suspicion of trickery and
  deceit which had arisen in his mind and would not down. What a beautiful face
  it was&mdash; not despite its irregular features, but because of them, and
  because of the character and individuality they imparted to her appearance.
  Custer could not look upon that face and doubt her.</p>

  <p>Several times she caught him in the act of scrutinizing her thus, and she
  wondered at it, for in the past he had never appeared to be consciously
  studying her. She was aware, too, that he was troubled about something. She
  wished that she might ask him&mdash;that she might invite his confidence, for
  she knew the pain of unshared sorrows; but he gave her no opening. So they
  rode together, often in silence; and though their stirrups touched many a
  time, yet constantly they rode farther and farther apart, just because chance
  had brought Custer Pennington from the office that Saturday afternoon to look
  out over the southern hills at the moment when Shannon had ridden down the
  trail into the meadow above Jackknife Cañon.</p>

  <p>At last Friday came. Neither had reverted, since the previous Saturday, to
  the subject that was uppermost in the mind of each; but now Shannon could not
  refrain from seeking once more to deter Custer from his project She had not
  been able to forget the sinister smile of the Mexican, or to rid her mind of
  an intuitive conviction that the man's final statement had concealed a hidden
  threat.</p>

  <p>They were parting at the fork of the road&mdash;she had hesitated until
  the last moment.</p>

  <p>"You still intend to try to catch those men to-night?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"I had hoped you would give it up. I am afraid something may happen.
  I&mdash;oh, please don't go, Custer!" She wished that she might add: "For my
  sake."</p>

  <p>He laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"I guess there won't be any trouble. If there is, I can take care of
  myself."</p>

  <p>She saw that it was useless to insist further.</p>

  <p>"Let me know if everything is all right," she asked. "Light the light in
  the big cupola on the house when you get back&mdash;I can see it from my
  bedroom window&mdash;and then I shall know that nothing has happened. I shall
  be watching for it."</p>

  <p>"All right," Custer promised, and they parted.</p>

  <p>He wondered why she should be so perturbed about his plans for the night.
  There was something peculiar about that&mdash;something that he couldn't
  understand or explain, except in accordance with a single hypothesis&mdash;a
  hypothesis which he scorned to consider, yet which rode his thoughts like a
  veritable <i>Little Old Man of the Sea</i>. Had he known the truth, it would
  all have been quite understandable; but how was he to know that Shannon Burke
  loved him?</p>

  <p>When he reached the house, the ranch bookkeeper came to tell him that the
  Los Angeles operator had been trying to get him all afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Somebody in L. A. wants to talk to you on important business," said the
  bookkeeper. "You're to call back the minute you get here."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later he had his connection. An unfamiliar voice asked if he
  were the younger Mr. Pennington.</p>

  <p>"I am," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Some one cut your fence last Friday. You like to know who he is?"</p>

  <p>"What about it? Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind who I am. I was with them. They double- crossed me. You want
  to catch 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know who they are, and why they cut my fence, and what the
  devil they're up to back there in the hills."</p>

  <p>"You listen to me. You <i>sabe</i> Jackknife Cañon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"To-night they bring down the load just before dark. They do that every
  Friday, and hide the burros until very late. Then they come down into the
  valley while every one is asleep. To-night they hide 'em in Jackknife. They
  tie 'em there an' go away. About ten o'clock they come back. You be there
  nine o'clock, and you catch 'em when they come back. <i>Sabe?</i>"</p>

  <p>"How many of 'em are there?"</p>

  <p>"Only two. You don't have to be afraid&mdash;they don't pack no guns. You
  take gun an' you catch 'em all alone."</p>

  <p>"But how do I know that you're not stringing me?"</p>

  <p>"You listen. They double-cross me. I get even. You no want to catch 'em, I
  no care&mdash;that's all. Good-by!"</p>

  <p>Custer turned away from the phone, running his fingers through his hair in
  a characteristic gesture signifying perplexity. What should he do? The
  message sounded rather fishy, he thought; but it would do no harm to have a
  look into Jackknife Cañon around nine o'clock. If he was being tricked, the
  worst he could fear was that they had taken this method of luring him to
  Jackknife while they brought the loaded burros down from the hills by some
  other route. If they had done that, it was very clever of them; but he would
  not be fooled a second time.</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington didn't care to be laughed at, and so, if he was going to
  be hoaxed that night, he had no intention of having a witness to his idiocy.
  For that reason he did not take Jake with him, but rode alone up Sycamore
  when all the inmates of the castle on the hill thought him in bed and asleep.
  It was a clear night. Objects were plainly discernible at short distances,
  and when he passed the horse pasture he saw the dim bulks of the brood mares
  a hundred yards away. A coyote voiced its uncanny cry from a near hill. An
  owl hooted dismally from a distance; but these sounds, rather than depressing
  him, had the opposite effect, for they were of the voices of the nights that
  he had known and loved since childhood.</p>

  <p>When he turned into Jackknife, he reined the Apache in and sat for a
  moment listening. From farther up the cañon, out of sight, there came the
  shadow of a sound. That would be the tethered burros, he thought, if the
  whole thing was not a trick; but he was certain that he heard the sound of
  something moving there.</p>

  <p>He rode on again, but he took the precaution of loosening his gun in its
  holster. There was, of course, the bare possibility of a sinister motive
  behind the message he had received. As he thought of it now, it occurred to
  him that his informant was perhaps a trifle too insistent in assuring him
  that it was safe to come up here alone. Well, the man had put it over
  cleverly, if that had been his intent.</p>

  <p>Now Custer saw a dark mass beneath a sycamore. He rode directly toward it,
  and in another moment he saw that it represented half a dozen laden burros
  tethered to the tree. He moved the Apache close in to examine them. There was
  no sign of men about.</p>

  <p>He examined the packs, leaning over and feeling one. What they contained
  he could not guess; but it was not firewood. They evidently consisted of six
  wooden boxes to each burro, three on a side.</p>

  <p>He reined the Apache in behind the burros in the darkness of the tree's
  shade, and there he waited for the coming of the men. He did not like the
  look of things at all. What could those boxes contain? There was no
  legitimate traffic through or out of those hills that could explain the
  weekly trip of this little pack train; and if the men in charge of it were
  employed in any illegitimate traffic, they would not be surrendering to a
  lone man as meekly as his informant had suggested. The days of smuggling
  through the hills from the ocean was over&mdash;or at least Custer had
  thought it was over; but this thing commenced to look like a recrudescence of
  the old-time commerce.</p>

  <p>As he sat there waiting, he had ample time to think. He speculated upon
  the identity and purpose of the mysterious informant who had called him up
  from Los Angeles. He speculated again upon the contents of the packs. He
  recalled the whisky that Guy had sold him from time to time, and wondered if
  the packs might not contain liquor. He had gathered from Guy that his supply
  came from Los Angeles, and he had never given the matter a second thought;
  but now he recalled the fact, and concluded that if this was whisky, it was
  not from the same source as Guy's.</p>

  <p>All the time he kept thinking of Shannon and her mysterious excursion into
  the hills. He recalled her anxiety to prevent him from coming up here
  to-night, and he tried to find reasonable explanations for it. Of course, it
  was the obvious explanation that did not occur to him; but several did occur
  that he tried to put from his mind.</p>

  <p>Then from the mouth of Jackknife he heard the sound of horses' hoofs. The
  Apache pricked up his ears, and Custer leaned forward and laid a hand upon
  his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Quiet, boy!" he admonished, in a low whisper.</p>

  <p>The sounds approached slowly, halting occasionally. Presently two horsemen
  rode directly past him on the far side of the cañon. They rode at a brisk
  trot. Apparently they did not see the pack train, or, if they saw it, they
  paid no attention to it. They disappeared in the darkness, and the sound of
  their horses' hoofs ceased. Pennington knew that they had halted. Who could
  they be? Certainly not the drivers of the pack train, else they would have
  stopped with the burros.</p>

  <p>He listened intently. Presently he heard horses walking slowly toward him
  from up the cañon. The two who had passed were coming
  back&mdash;stealthily.</p>

  <p>"I sure have got myself in a pretty trap!" he soliloquized a moment later,
  when he heard the movement of mounted men in the cañon below him.</p>

  <p>He drew his gun and sat waiting. It was not long that he had to wait. A
  voice coming from a short distance down the cañon addressed him.</p>

  <p>"Ride out into the open and hold up your hands!" it said. "We got you
  surrounded and covered. If you make a brew, we'll bore you. Come on, now,
  step lively&mdash;and keep your hands up!"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of an American.</p>

  <p>"Who in thunder are you?" demanded Pennington^</p>

  <p>"I am a United States marshal," was the quick reply.</p>

  <p>Pennington laughed. There was something convincing in the very tone of the
  man's voice&mdash;possibly because Custer had been expecting to meet
  Mexicans. Here was a hoax indeed; but evidently as much on the newcomers as
  on himself. They had expected to find a lawbreaker. They would doubtless be
  angry when they discovered that they had been duped.</p>

  <p>Custer rode slowly out from beneath the tree.</p>

  <p>"Hold up your hands, Mr. Pennington!" snapped the marshal.</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington was nonplused. They knew who he was, and yet they
  demanded that he should hold up his hands like a common criminal.</p>

  <p>"Hold on there!" he cried. "What's the joke? If you know who I am, what do
  you want me to hold up my hands for? How do I know you're a marshal?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know it; but I know that you're armed, and that you're in a
  mighty bad hole. I don't know what you might do, and I ain't taking no
  chances. So stick 'em up, and do it quick. If anybody's going to get bored
  around here it'll be you, and not none of my men!"</p>

  <p>"You're a damned fool," said Pennington succinctly; but he held his hands
  before his shoulders, as he had been directed.</p>

  <p>Five men rode from the shadows and surrounded him. One of them dismounted
  and disarmed him. He lowered his hands and looked about at them.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind," he said, "showing me your authority for this, and
  telling me what in hell it's all about?"</p>

  <p>One of the men threw back his coat, revealing a silver shield.</p>

  <p>"That's my authority," he said; "that, and the goods we got on you."</p>

  <p>"What goods?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we expect to get 'em when we examine those packs."</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said Custer. "You're all wrong. I have nothing to do with
  that pack train or what it's packing. I came up here to catch the fellows who
  have been bringing it down through Ganado every Friday night, and who cut our
  fence last week. I don't know any more about what's in those packs than, you
  do&mdash;evidently not as much."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Mr. Pennington. You'll probably get a chance to tell
  all that to a jury. We been laying for you since last spring. We didn't know
  it was you until one of your gang squealed; but we knew that this stuff was
  somewhere in the hills above L.A., and we aimed to get it and you sooner or
  later."</p>

  <p>"Me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not you particularly, but whoever was bootlegging it. To tell you
  the truth, I'm plumb surprised to find who it is. I thought all along it was
  some gang of cheap greasers; but it don't make no difference who it is to
  your Uncle Sam."</p>

  <p>"You say some one told you it was I?" asked Custer.</p>

  <p>"Sure! How else would we know it? It don't pay to double- cross your pals,
  Mr. Pennington."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We're going to take you back to L.A. and get you held to the Federal
  grand jury."</p>

  <p>"To-night?"</p>

  <p>"We're going to take you back to-night"</p>

  <p>"Can I stop at the house first?"</p>

  <p>"No. We got a warrant to search the place, and we're going to leave a
  couple of my men here to do it the first thing in the morning. I got an idea
  you ain't the only one around there that knows something about this
  business."</p>

  <p>As they talked, one of the deputies had taken a case from a pack and
  opened it.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" he called. "It's it, all right!"</p>

  <p>"It's what?" asked Custer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, pe-ru-na, of course!" replied the deputy facetiously. "What did you
  think it was? I hope you never thought it none of that hootch stolen from a
  government bonded warehouse in New York!"</p>

  <p>The others laughed at his joke.</p>

  <p>"It's too bad," said the marshal, not at all unkindly, "for a decent young
  fellow like you to get mixed up in a nasty business like this."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you," said Pennington.</p>

  <p>His mind traveled like lightning, flashing a picture of Shannon Burke
  riding out of the hills and across the meadow above Jackknife Cañon; of her
  inquiry that very afternoon as to whether he was coming up here to-night. Had
  she really wished to dissuade him, or had she only desired to make sure of
  his intentions? The light would not shine from the big cupola to-night What
  message would the darkness carry to Shannon Burke?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THEY took Custer down to the village of Ganado, where they
  had left their cars and obtained horses. Here they left the animals,
  including the Apache, with instructions that he should be returned to the
  Rancho del Ganado in the morning.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of the village, almost to a man, had grown up in
  neighborly friendship with the Penningtons. When he from whom the officers
  had obtained their mounts discovered the identity of the prisoner, his
  surprise was exceeded only by his anger.</p>

  <p>"If I'd known who you was after," he said, "you'd never have got no horses
  from me. I'd 'a' hamstrung 'em first! I've known Cus Pennington since he was
  knee high to a grasshopper, and whatever you took him for he never done it.
  Wait till the colonel hears of this. You won't have no more job than a jack
  rabbit!"</p>

  <p>The marshal turned threateningly toward the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" he advised. "If Colonel Pennington hears of this before
  morning, you'll wish to God you was a jack rabbit, and could get out of the
  country in two jumps! Now you get what I'm telling you&mdash;you're to keep
  your trap closed until morning. Hear me?"</p>

  <p>"I ain't deaf, but sometimes I'm a leetle mite dumb." The last he added in
  a low aside to Pennington, accompanying it with a wink; and aloud: "I'm
  mighty sorry, Cus&mdash; <i>mighty</i> sorry. If I'd only knowed it was you!
  By gosh, I'll never get over this&mdash;furnishin' horses to help arrest a
  friend, and a Pennington!"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that for a minute, Jim. I haven't done anything. It's
  just a big mistake."</p>

  <p>The officers and their prisoner were in the car ready to start. The
  marshal pointed a finger at Jim.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget what I told you about keeping your mouth shut until
  morning," he admonished.</p>

  <p>They drove off toward Los Angeles. Jim watched them for a moment, as the
  red tail light diminished in the distance. Then he turned into the office of
  his feed barn and took the telephone receiver from its hook. "Gimme Ganado
  No. 1," he said to the sleepy night operator.</p>

  <p>It was five minutes before continuous ringing brought the colonel to the
  extension telephone in his bedroom. He seemed unable to comprehend the
  meaning of what Jim was trying to tell him, so sure was he that Custer was in
  bed and asleep in a near-by room; but at last he was half convinced, for he
  had known Jim for many years, and well knew his stability and his
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"If it was anybody but you, Jim, I'd say you were a damned liar," he
  commented in characteristic manner; "but what in hell did they take the boy f
  or?"</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't say. Just as I told 'em. I don't know what he done, but I
  know he never done it."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Jim&mdash;my boy couldn't do a crooked thing!"</p>

  <p>"I'm just like you, colonel&mdash;I know there ain't a crooked hair in Cus
  Pennington's head. If there's anything I can do, colonel, you jest let me
  know."</p>

  <p>"You'll bring the Apache up in the morning? Thank you again, Jim, and
  good-by."</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver. While he dressed hastily, he explained to his
  wife the purport of the message he had just received.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, Custer?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to Los Angeles, Julia. Unless that marshal's driving a racing
  car, I'll be waiting for him when he gets there!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">Shortly before breakfast the following morning two officers,
  armed with a warrant, searched the castle on the hill. In Custer Pennington's
  closet they found something which seemed to fill them with elation&mdash;two
  full bottles of whisky and an empty bottle, each bearing a label identical
  with those on the bottles they had found in the cases borne by the burros.
  With this evidence and the laden pack train, they started off toward the
  village.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Shannon Burke had put in an almost sleepless night. For
  hours she had lain watching the black silhouette of the big cupola against
  the clear sky, waiting for the light which would announce that Custer had
  returned home in safety; but no light had shone to relieve her anxiety. She
  had strained her ears through the long hours of the night for the sound of
  shooting from the hills; but only the howling of coyotes and the hooting of
  owls had disturbed the long silence. She sought to assure herself that all
  was well&mdash;that Custer had returned and forgotten to switch on the cupola
  light&mdash;that he had not forgotten, but that the bulb was burned out. She
  manufactured probable and improbable explanations by the score; but always a
  disturbing premonition of evil dispersed the cohorts of hope.</p>

  <p>She was up early in the morning, and in the saddle at the first streak of
  dawn, riding directly to the stables of the Rancho del Ganado. The stableman
  was there, saddling the horses while they fed.</p>

  <p>"No one has come down yet?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The Apache's gone," he replied. "I don't understand it. He hasn't been in
  his box all night. I was just thinkin' of goin' up to the house to see if
  Custer was there. Don't seem likely he'd be ridin' all night, does it?"</p>

  <p>"No," she said. Her heart was in her mouth. She could scarcely speak.
  "I'll ride up for you," she managed to say.</p>

  <p>Wheeling Baldy, she put him up the steep hill to the house. The iron gate
  that closed the patio arch at night was still down, so she rode around to the
  north side of the house and <i>coo-hooed</i> to attract the attention of some
  one within. Mrs. Pennington, followed by Eva, came to the door. Both were
  fully dressed. When they saw who it was, they came out and told Shannon what
  had happened.</p>

  <p>He was not injured, then. The sudden sense of relief left her weak, and
  for a moment she did not consider the other danger that confronted him. He
  was safe! That was all she cared about just then. Later she commenced to
  realize the gravity of his situation, and the innocent part that she had
  taken in involving him in the toils of the scheme which her interference must
  have suggested to those actually responsible for the traffic in stolen
  liquor, the guilt of which they had now cleverly shifted to the shoulders of
  an innocent man. Intuitively she guessed Slick Allen's part in the unhappy
  contretemps of the previous night; for she knew of the threats he had made
  against Custer Pennington, and of his complicity in the criminal operations
  of the bootleggers.</p>

  <p>How much she knew! More than any other, she knew all the details of the
  whole tragic affair. She alone could untangle the knotted web, and yet she
  dared not until there was no other way. She dared not let them guess that she
  knew more of the matter than they. She could not admit such knowledge without
  revealing the source of it and exposing herself to the merited contempt of
  these people whose high regard had become her obsession, whose friendship was
  her sole happiness, and the love she had conceived for one of them the secret
  altar at which she worshiped.</p>

  <p>In the last extremity, if there was no alternative, she would sacrifice
  everything for him. To that her love committed her; but she would wait until
  there was no other way. She had suffered so grievously through no fault of
  her own that she clung with desperation to the brief happiness which had come
  into her life, and which was now threatened, once again because of no
  wrongdoing on her part.</p>

  <p>Fate had been consistently unkind to her. Was it fair that she should
  suffer always for the wickedness of another? She had at least the right to
  hope and wait.</p>

  <p>But there was something that she could do. When she turned Baldy down the
  hill from the Penningtons', she took the road home that led past the Evanses'
  ranch, and, turning in, dismounted and tied Baldy at the fence. Her knock was
  answered by Mrs. Evans.</p>

  <p>"Is Guy here?" asked Shannon.</p>

  <p>Hearing her voice, Guy came from his room, drawing on his coat.</p>

  <p>"You're getting as bad as the Penningtons," he said, laughing. "They have
  no respect for Christian hours!"</p>

  <p>"Something has happened," she said, "that I thought you should know about.
  Custer was arrested last night by government officers and taken to Los
  Angeles. He was out on the Apache at the time. No one seems to know where he
  was arrested, or why; but the supposition is that they found him in the
  hills, for the man who runs the feed barn in the village&mdash;Jim&mdash;told
  the colonel that the officers got horses from him and rode up toward the
  ranch, and that it was a couple of hours later that they brought Custer back
  on the Apache. The stableman just told me that the Apache had not been in his
  stall all night, and I know&mdash;Custer told me not to tell, but it will
  make no difference now&mdash;that he was going up into the hills last night
  to try to catch the men who have been bringing down loads on burros every
  Friday night for a long time, and who cut his fence last Friday."</p>

  <p>She looked straight into Guy's eyes as she spoke; but he dropped his as a
  flush mounted his cheek.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she continued, "that Guy might want to go to Los Angeles and
  see if he could help Custer in any way. The colonel went last night."</p>

  <p>"I'll go now," said Guy. "I guess I can help him."</p>

  <p>His voice was suddenly weary, and he turned away with an air of dejection
  which assured Shannon that he intended to do the only honorable thing that he
  could do&mdash;assume the guilt that had been thrown upon Custer's shoulders,
  no matter what the consequences to himself. She had had little doubt that Guy
  would do this, for she realized his affection for Custer, as well as the
  impulsive generosity of his nature, which, however marred by weakness, was
  still fine by instinct.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, after a hasty breakfast, young Evans started for Los
  Angeles, while his mother and Shannon, standing on the porch of the bungalow,
  waved their good-bys as his roadster swung through the gate into the county
  road. Mrs. Evans had only a vague idea as to what her son could do to assist
  Custer Pennington out of his difficulty; but Shannon Burke knew that
  Pennington's fate lay in the hands of Guy Evans, unless she chose to tell
  what she knew.</p>

  <p>Colonel Pennington had overtaken the marshal's car before the latter
  reached Los Angeles, but after a brief parley on the road he had discovered
  that he could do nothing to alter the officer's determination to place Custer
  in the county jail pending his preliminary hearing before a United States
  commissioner. Neither the colonel's plea that his son should be allowed to
  accompany him to a hotel for the night, nor his assurance that he would be
  personally responsible for the young man's appearance before the commissioner
  on the following morning, availed to move the obdurate marshal from his
  stand; nor would he permit the colonel to talk with the prisoner.</p>

  <p>This was the last straw. Colonel Pennington had managed to dissemble
  outward indications of his rising ire, but now an amused smile lighted his
  son's face as he realized that his father was upon the verge of an explosion.
  He caught the older man's eye and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It'll only make it worse," he cautioned.</p>

  <p>The colonel directed a parting glare at the marshal, muttered something
  about homeopathic intellects, and turned back to his roadster.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DURING the long ride to Los Angeles, and later in his cell
  in the county jail, Custer Pennington had devoted many hours to seeking an
  explanation of the motives underlying the plan to involve him in a crime of
  which he had no knowledge, nor even a suspicion of the identity of its
  instigators. To his knowledge, he had no enemies whose hostility was
  sufficiently active to lead them to do him so great a wrong. He had had no
  trouble with any one recently, other than his altercation with Slick Allen
  several months before; yet it was obvious that he had been deliberately
  sacrificed for some ulterior purpose. What that purpose was he could only
  surmise.</p>

  <p>The most logical explanation, he finally decided, was that those actually
  responsible, realizing that discovery was imminent, had sought to divert
  suspicion from themselves by fastening it upon another. That they had
  selected him as the victim might easily be explained on the ground that his
  embarrassing interest in their movements had already centered their attention
  upon him, while it also offered the opportunity for luring him into the trap
  without arousing his suspicions.</p>

  <p>It was, then, just a combination of circumstances that had led him into
  his present predicament; but there still remained unanswered one question
  that affected his peace of mind more considerably than all the others
  combined. Who had divulged to the thieves his plans for the previous
  night?</p>

  <p>Concurrently with that question there arose before his mind's eye a
  picture of Shannon Burke and Baldy as they topped the summit above Jackknife
  from the trail that led across the basin meadow back into the hills, he knew
  not where.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe that it was she," he told himself for the hundredth time.
  "She could not have done it. I won't believe it! She could explain it all if
  I could ask her; but I can't ask her. There is a great deal that I cannot
  understand, and the most inexplicable thing is that she could possibly have
  had any connection whatever with the affair."</p>

  <p>When his father came with an attorney, in the morning, the son made no
  mention of Shannon Burke's ride into the hills, or of her anxiety, when they
  parted in the afternoon, to learn if he was going to carry out his plan for
  Friday night.</p>

  <p>"Did any one know of your intention to watch for these men?" asked the
  attorney.</p>

  <p>"No one," he replied; "but they might have become suspicious from the fact
  that the week before I had all the gates padlocked on Friday. They had to cut
  the fence that night to get through. They probably figured that it was
  getting too hot for them, and that on the following Friday I would take some
  other steps to discover them. Then they made sure of it by sending me that
  message from Los Angeles. Gee, but I bit like a sucker!"</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate," remarked the attorney, "that you had not discussed
  your plans with some one before you undertook to carry them out on Friday
  night. If we could thus definitely establish your motive for going alone into
  the hills, and to the very spot where you were discovered with the pack
  train, I think it would go much further toward convincing the court that you
  were there without any criminal intent than your own unsupported testimony to
  that effect!"</p>

  <p>"But haven't you his word for it?" demanded the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I am not the court," replied the attorney, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Well, if the court isn't a damned fool it'll know he wouldn't have
  padlocked the gates the week before to keep himself out," stated the colonel
  conclusively.</p>

  <p>"The government might easily assume that he did that purposely to divert
  suspicion from himself. At least, it is no proof of innocence."</p>

  <p>Colonel Pennington snorted.</p>

  <p>"The best thing to do now," said the attorney, "is to see if we can get an
  immediate hearing, and arrange for bail in case he is held to the grand
  jury."</p>

  <p>"Ill go with you," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>They had been gone but a short time when Guy Evans was admitted to
  Custer's cell. The latter looked up and smiled when he saw who his visitor
  was.</p>

  <p>"It was bully of you to come," he said. "Bringing condolences, or looking
  for material, old thing?"</p>

  <p>"Don't joke, Cus," exclaimed Evans. "It's too rotten to joke about, and
  it's all my fault."</p>

  <p>"Your fault?"</p>

  <p>"I am the guilty one. I've come down to give myself up."</p>

  <p>"Guilty! Give yourself up! What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"God, Cus, I hate to tell you. It didn't seem such an awful thing to do
  until this happened. Every one's buying booze, or selling booze, or making
  booze. Every one's breaking the damned old Eighteenth Amendment, and it's got
  so it don't seem like committing a crime, or anything like that. You know,
  Cus, that I wouldn't do anything criminal, and, oh, God, what'll Eva
  think?"</p>

  <p>Guy covered his face with his hands and choked back a sob.</p>

  <p>"Just what the devil are you talking about?" inquired Pennington. "Do you
  mean to tell me that you have been mixed up in&mdash;well, what do you know
  about that?"</p>

  <p>A sudden light had dawned upon Custer's understanding.</p>

  <p>"That hootch that you've been getting me&mdash;that I joked you
  about&mdash;it was really the stuff that was stolen from a bonded warehouse
  in New York? It wasn't any joke at all?"</p>

  <p>"You can see for yourself now how much of a joke it was," replied
  Evans.</p>

  <p>"I'll admit," returned Custer ruefully, "that it does require considerable
  of a sense of humor to see it in this joint!"</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose they'll do to me?" asked Guy. "Do you suppose they'll
  send me to the penitentiary?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me the whole thing from the beginning&mdash;who got you into it, and
  just what you've done. Don't omit a thing, no matter how much it incriminates
  you. I don't need to tell you, old man, that I'm for you, no matter what
  you've done."</p>

  <p>"I know that, Cus; but I'm afraid no one can help me. I'm in for it. I
  knew it was stolen from the start. I have been selling it since last
  May&mdash;seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-six quarts of it&mdash;and
  I made a dollar on every quart. It was what I was going to start housekeeping
  on. Poor little Eva!"</p>

  <p>Again a sob half choked him.</p>

  <p>"It was Slick Allen that started me. First he sold me some; then he got me
  to sell you a bottle, and bring him the money. Then he had me, or at least he
  made me think so; and he insisted on my handling it for them out in the
  valley. It wasn't hard to persuade me, for it looked safe, and it didn't seem
  like such a rotten thing to do, and I wanted the money the worst way. I know
  they're all bum excuses. I shan't make any excuses&mdash;I'll take my
  medicine; but it's when I think of Eva that it hurts. It's only Eva that
  counts!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pennington, laying his hand affectionately on the other's
  shoulder. "It is only Eva who counts; and because of Eva, and because you and
  I love her so much, you cannot go to the penitentiary."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;cannot go?"</p>

  <p>"Have you told any one else what you have just told me?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Don't. Go back home, and keep your mouth shut," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will take a chance of going up for what I did? Nothing
  doing! Do you suppose I'd let you, Cus, the best friend I've got in the
  world, go to the pen for me&mdash;for something I did?"</p>

  <p>"It's not for you, Guy. I wouldn't go to the pen for you or any other man;
  but I'd go to the pen for Eva, and so would you."</p>

  <p>"I know it, but I can't let you do it I'm not rotten, Cus!"</p>

  <p>"You and I don't count. To see her unhappy and humiliated would be worse
  for me than spending a few years in the penitentiary. I'm innocent. No matter
  if I am convicted, I'll know I'm innocent, and Eva'll know it, and so will
  all the rest at Ganado; but, Guy, they've got too much on you if they ever
  suspect you, and the fact that you voluntarily admitted your guilt would
  convince even my little sister. If you were sent up it might ruin her
  life&mdash;it <i>would</i> ruin it. Things could never be the same for her
  again; but if I was sentenced for a few years, it would only be the
  separation from a brother whom she knew to be innocent, and in whom she still
  had undiminished confidence. She wouldn't be humiliated&mdash;her life
  wouldn't be ruined; and when I came back everything would be just as it was
  before. If you go, things will not be the same when you come back&mdash;they
  can never be the same again. You cannot go!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot let you go, and be punished for what I did, while I remain
  free!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to&mdash;it's the easiest way. We've all got to be punished
  for what you did&mdash;those who love us are always punished for our sins;
  but let me tell you that I don't think you are going to escape punishment if
  I go up for this. You're going to suffer more than I. You're going to suffer
  more than you would if you went up yourself; but it can't be helped. The
  question is, are you man enough to do this for Eva? It is your sacrifice more
  than mine."</p>

  <p>Evans swallowed hard and tried to speak. It was a moment before he
  succeeded.</p>

  <p>"My God, Cus, I'd rather go myself!"</p>

  <p>"I know you would."</p>

  <p>"I can never have any self-respect again. I can never look a decent man in
  the face. Every time I see Eva, or your mother, or the colonel, I'll think:
  'You dirty cur, you let their boy go to the pen for something you did!' Oh,
  Cus, please don't ask me to do it! There must be some other way.
  And&mdash;and, Cus, think of Grace. We've been forgetting Grace. What'll it
  mean to Grace if you are sent up?"</p>

  <p>"It won't mean anything to Grace, and you know it. None of us mean much to
  Grace any more."</p>

  <p>Guy looked out of the little barred window, and tears came to his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I guess you're right," he said.</p>

  <p>"You're going to do it, Guy&mdash;for Eva?"</p>

  <p>"For Eva&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>Pennington brightened up as if a great load had been lifted from his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Good!" he cried. "Now the chances are that I'll not be sent up, for
  they've nothing on me&mdash;they can't have; but if I am, you've got to take
  my place with the folks. You've had your lesson. I know you'll never pull
  another fool stunt like this again. And quit drinking, Guy. I haven't much
  excuse for preaching; but you're the sort that can't do it. Leave it alone.
  Good-by, now; I'd rather you were not here when father comes back&mdash;you
  might weaken."</p>

  <p>Evans took the other's hand.</p>

  <p>"I envy you, Cus&mdash;on the level, I do!"</p>

  <p>"I know it; but don't feel too bad about it. It's one of those things
  that's done, and it can't be undone. Roosevelt would have called what you've
  got to do 'grasping the nettle.' Grasp it like a man!"</p>

  <p>Evans walked slowly from the jail, entered his car, and drove away. Of the
  two hearts his was the heavier; of the two burdens his the more difficult to
  bear.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Custer Pennington, appearing before a United States
  commissioner that afternoon for his preliminary hearing, was held to the
  Federal grand jury, and admitted to bail. The evidence brought by the
  deputies who had searched the Pennington home, taken in connection with the
  circumstances surrounding his arrest, seemed to leave the commissioner no
  alternative. Even the colonel had to admit that to himself, though he would
  never have admitted it to another. The case would probably come up before the
  grand jury on the following Wednesday.</p>

  <p>The colonel wanted to employ detectives at once to ferret out those
  actually responsible for the theft and bootlegging of the stolen whisky; but
  Custer managed to persuade him not to do so, on the ground that it would be a
  waste of time and money, since the government was already engaged upon a
  similar pursuit.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, father," he said. "They haven't a shred of evidence that I
  stole the whisky, or that I ever sold any. They found me with it&mdash;that
  is all. I can't be hanged for that. Let them do the worrying. I want to get
  home in time to eat one of Hannah's dinners. I'll say they don't set much of
  a table in the sheriff's boarding house!"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get the three bottles they found in your room?"</p>

  <p>"I bought them."</p>

  <p>"I asked where, not how."</p>

  <p>"I might get some one else mixed up in this if I were to answer that
  question. I can't do it."</p>

  <p>"No," said the colonel, "you can't. When you buy whisky, nowadays, you are
  usually compounding a felony. It's certainly a rotten condition to obtain in
  the land of the free; but you've got to protect your accomplices. I shall not
  ask you again; but they'll ask you in court, my boy."</p>

  <p>"All the good it'll do them!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so; but I'd hate to see my boy sent to the penitentiary."</p>

  <p>"You'd hate to be in court and hear him divulge the name of a man who had
  trusted him sufficiently to sell him whisky."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather see you go to the penitentiary!" the colonel said.</p><br>

  <p class="first">That night, at dinner, Custer made light of the charge
  against him, yet at the same time he prepared them for what might happen, for
  the proceedings before the commissioner had impressed him with the gravity of
  his case, as had also the talk he had had with his attorney afterward.</p>

  <p>"No matter what happens," he said to them all, "I shall know that you know
  I am not guilty."</p>

  <p>"My boy's word is all I need," replied his mother.</p>

  <p>Eva came and put her arms about him.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't send you to jail, would they?" she demanded. "It would
  break my heart!"</p>

  <p>"Not if you knew I was innocent."</p>

  <p>"N-no, not then, I suppose; but it would be awful. If you were guilty, it
  would kill me. I'd never want to live if my brother was convicted of a crime,
  and was guilty of it. I'd kill myself first!"</p>

  <p>Her brother drew her face down and kissed her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"That would be foolish, dear," he said. "No matter what one of us does,
  such an act would make it all the worse&mdash;for those who were left."</p>

  <p>"I can't help it," she said. "It isn't just because I have had the honor
  of the Penningtons preached to me all my life. It's because it's in
  me&mdash;the Pennington honor. It's a part of me, just as it's a part of you,
  and mother, and father. It's a part of the price we have to pay for being
  Penningtons. I have always been proud of it, Custer, even if I am only a
  silly girl."</p>

  <p>"I'm proud of it, too, and I haven't jeopardized it; but even if I had,
  you mustn't think about killing yourself on my account, or any one's
  else."</p>

  <p>"Well, I know you're not guilty, so I don't have to."</p>

  <p>"Good! Let's talk about something pleasant."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you see Grace while you were in Los Angeles?"</p>

  <p>"I tried to. I called up her boarding place from the lawyer's office. I
  understood the woman who answered the phone to say that she would call her,
  but she came back in a couple of minutes and said that Grace was out on
  location."</p>

  <p>"Did you leave your name?"</p>

  <p>"I told the woman who I was when she answered the phone."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you didn't see her," said Mrs. Pennington. "I often think that
  Mrs. Evans, or Guy, should run down to Los Angeles occasionally and see
  Grace."</p>

  <p>"That's what Shannon says," said Custer. "I'll try to see her next week,
  before I come home."</p>

  <p>"Shannon was up nearly all afternoon waiting to hear if we received any
  word from you. When you telephoned that you had been held to the Federal
  grand jury, she would scarcely believe it. She said there must be some
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Did she say anything else?"</p>

  <p>"She asked whether Guy got there before you were held and I told her that
  you said Guy visited you in the jail. She seems so worried about the
  affair&mdash;just as if she were one of the family. She is such a dear girl!
  I think I grow to love her more and more every day."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Custer, non-committally.</p>

  <p>"She asked me one rather peculiar question," Eva went on.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>"She asked if I was <i>sure</i> that it was <i>you</i> who had been held
  to the grand jury."</p>

  <p>"That was odd, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"She's so sure of your innocence&mdash;just as sure as we are," said
  Eva.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's very nice of her," remarked Custer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE next morning he saw Shannon, who came to ride with them,
  the Penningtons, as had been her custom. She looked tired, as if she had
  spent a sleepless night. She had&mdash;she had spent two sleepless nights,
  and she had had to fight the old fight all over again. It had been very hard,
  even though she had won, for it had shown her that the battle was not over.
  She had thought that she had conquered the craving; but that had been when
  she had had no troubles or unhappiness to worry her mind and nerves. The last
  two days had been days of suffering for her, and the two sleepless nights had
  induced a nervous condition that begged for the quieting influence of the
  little white powder.</p>

  <p>Custer noticed immediately that something was amiss. The roses were gone
  from her cheeks, leaving a suggestion of the old pallor; and though she
  smiled and greeted him happily, he thought that he detected an expression of
  wistfulness and pain in her face when she was not conscious that others were
  observing her.</p>

  <p>There was a strange suggestion of change in their relations, which Custer
  did not attempt to analyze. It was as if he had been gone a long time, and,
  returning, had found Shannon changed through the natural processes of time
  and separation. She was not the same girl&mdash;she could never be the same
  again, nor could their relations ever be the same.</p>

  <p>The careless freedom of their association, which had resembled that of a
  brother and sister more than any other relationship between a man and a
  woman, had gone forever. What had replaced it Custer did not know. Sometimes
  he thought that it was a suspicion of Shannon that clung to his mind in spite
  of himself, but again and again he assured himself that he held no suspicion
  of her.</p>

  <p>He wished, though, that she would explain that which was to him
  inexplicable. He had the faith to believe that she could explain it
  satisfactorily; but would she do so? She had had the opportunity, before this
  thing had occurred, and had not taken advantage of it. He would give her
  another opportunity that day, and he prayed that she would avail herself of
  it. Why he should care so much, he did not try to reason. He did not even
  realize how much he did care.</p>

  <p>Presently he turned toward her.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ride over to the east pasture after breakfast," he said,
  and waited.</p>

  <p>"Is that an invitation?"</p>

  <p>He smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"But not if it isn't perfectly convenient," he added.</p>

  <p>"I'd love to come with you. You know I always do."</p>

  <p>"Fine! And you'll breakfast with us?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day. I have a couple of letters to write that I want to get off
  right away; but I'll be up between eight thirty and nine. Is that too
  late?"</p>

  <p>"I'll ride down after breakfast and wait for you&mdash;if I won't be in
  the way."</p>

  <p>"Of course you won't. It will take me only a few minutes to write my
  letters."</p>

  <p>"How are you going to mail them? This is Sunday."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Powers is going to drive in to Los Angeles to-day. He'll mail them in
  the city."</p>

  <p>"Who looks after things when Mr. and Mrs. Powers are away?"</p>

  <p>"Who looks after things? Why, I do."</p>

  <p>"The chickens, and the sow, and Baldy&mdash;you take care of them
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, and I have more than that now."</p>

  <p>"How's that?"</p>

  <p>"Nine little pigs! They came yesterday. They're perfect beauties."</p>

  <p>The man laughed.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing about?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"The idea of you taking care of chickens and pigs and a horse!"</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything funny about it, and it's lot of fun. Did you think I
  was too stupid?"</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking what a change two months have made. What would you
  have done if you'd been left alone two months ago with a hundred hens, a
  horse, and ten pigs to care for?"</p>

  <p>"The question then would have been what the hens, the horse, and the pigs
  would have done; but now I know pretty well what to do. The two letters I
  have to write are about the little pigs. I don't know much about them, and so
  I am writing to Berkeley and Washington for the latest bulletins."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you ask <i>us</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Gracious, but I do! I am forever asking the colonel questions, and the
  boys at the hog house must hate to see me coming. I've spent hours in the
  office, reading Lovejoy and Colton; but I want something for ready reference.
  I've an idea that I can raise lots more hogs than I intended by fencing the
  orchard and growing alfalfa between the rows, for pasture. There's something
  solid and substantial about hogs that suggests a bank balance even in the
  years when the orange crop may be short or a failure, or the market
  poor."</p>

  <p>"You've got the right idea," said Custer. "There isn't a rancher or an
  orchardist, big or little, in the valley who couldn't make more money year in
  and year out if he'd keep a few brood sows."</p>

  <p>"What's Cus doing?" asked Eva, who had reined back beside them. "Preaching
  hog-raising again? That's his idea of a dapper little way to entertain a
  girl&mdash;hogs, Herefords and horses! Wouldn't he make a hit in society?
  Regular little tea pointer, I'll say!"</p>

  <p>"I knew you were about to say something," remarked her brother. "You've
  been quiet for all of five minutes."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking," said Eva. "I've been thinking how lonely it will be
  when you have to go away to jail."</p>

  <p>"Why, they can't send me to jail&mdash;I haven't done anything," he tried
  to reassure her.</p>

  <p>"I'm so afraid, Cus!" The tears came to her eyes. "I lay awake for hours
  last night, thinking about it. Oh, Cus, I just couldn't stand it if they sent
  you to jail! Do you think the men who did it would let you go for something
  they did? Could any one be so wicked? I never hated any one in my life, but I
  could hate them, if they don't come forward and save you. I could <i>hate</i>
  them, <i>hate</i> them, <i>hate</i> them! Oh, Cus, I believe that I could
  <i>kill</i> the man who would do such a thing to my brother!"</p>

  <p>"Come, dear, don't worry about it. The chances are that they'll free me.
  Even if they don't, you mustn't feel quite so bitterly against the men who
  are responsible. There may be reasons that you know nothing of that would
  keep them silent. Let's not talk about it. All we can do now is to wait and
  see what the grand jury is going to do. In the meantime I don't intend to
  worry."</p>

  <p>Shannon Burke, her heart heavy with shame and sorrow, listened as might a
  condemned man to the reading of his death sentence. She felt almost the
  degradation that might have been hers had she deliberately planned to ensnare
  Custer Pennington in the toils that had been laid for him.</p>

  <p>She determined that she would go before the grand jury and tell all she
  knew. Then she would go away. She would not have to see the contempt and
  hatred they must surely feel for her after she had recited the cold facts
  that she must lay before the jury, unmitigated by any of those extenuating
  truths that must lie forever hidden in the secret recesses of her soul. They
  would know only that she might have warned Custer, and did not; that she
  might have cleared him at his preliminary hearing, and did not. The fact that
  she had come to his rescue at the eleventh hour would not excuse her, in
  their minds, of the guilt of having permitted the Pennington honor to be
  placed in jeopardy needlessly; nor could it explain her knowledge of the
  crime, or those associations of her past life that had made it possible for
  her to have gained such knowledge.</p>

  <p>No, she could never face them again after the following Wednesday; but
  until then she would cling to the brief days of happiness that remained to
  her before the final catastrophe of her life, for it was thus that she
  thought of it&mdash;the moment and the act that would forever terminate her
  intercourse with the Penningtons, that would turn the respect of the man she
  loved to loathing.</p>

  <p>She counted the hours before the end. There would be two more morning
  rides&mdash;to-morrow and Tuesday. They would ask her to dinner, or to lunch,
  or to breakfast several times in the ensuing three days, and there would be
  rides with Custer. She would take all the happy memories that she could into
  the bleak and sunless future.</p>

  <p>Their ride that morning was over a loved and familiar trail that led
  across El Camino Corto over low hills into Horse Camp Cañon, and up Horse
  Camp to Coyote Springs; then over El Camino Largo to Sycamore Cañon and down
  beneath the old, old sycamores to the ranch. She felt that she knew each bush
  and tree and boulder, and they held for her the quiet restfulness of the
  familiar faces of old friends. She should miss them, but she would carry them
  in her memory forever.</p>

  <p>When they came to the fork in the road, she would not let Custer ride home
  with her.</p>

  <p>"At eight thirty, then," he called to her, as she urged Baldy into a
  canter and left them with a gay wave of the hand that gave no token of the
  heavy sorrow in her heart.</p>

  <p>As was her custom, she ate breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Powers at the
  little tenant cottage a couple of hundred yards in rear of her own
  bungalow&mdash;a practice which gave her an opportunity to discuss each day's
  work in advance with her foreman, and at the same time to add to her store of
  information concerning matters of ranching and citrus culture. Her knowledge
  of these things had broadened rapidly, and was a constant source of surprise
  to Powers, who took great pride in bragging about it to his friends; for
  Shannon had won as great a hold upon the hearts of these two as she had upon
  all who were fortunate enough to know her well.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, as she was returning to her bungalow to write her
  letters, she saw a Mexican boy on a bicycle turn in at her gate. They met in
  front of the bungalow.</p>

  <p>"Are you Miss Burke?" he asked. "Bartolo says for you to come to his camp
  in the mountains this morning, sure," he went on, having received an
  affirmative reply.</p>

  <p>"Who is Bartolo?"</p>

  <p>"He says you know. You went to his camp a week ago yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I do not know him and will not go."</p>

  <p>"He says to tell you that he only wants to talk to you about your friend
  who is in trouble."</p>

  <p>The girl thought for a moment. Possibly here was a way out of her dilemma.
  If she could force Bartolo by threats of exposure, he might discover a way to
  clear Custer Pennington without incriminating himself. She turned to the
  boy.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I will come."</p>

  <p>"I do not see him again. He is up in his camp now. He told me this
  yesterday. He also told me to tell you that he would be watching for you, and
  if you did not come alone you would not find him."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said, and turned into the bungalow.</p>

  <p>She wrote her letters, but she was not thinking about them. Then she took
  them over to Powers to take to the city for her. After that she went to the
  telephone and called the Rancho del Ganado, asking for Custer when she got
  the connection.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly disappointed," she said, when he came to the telephone. "I
  find I simply can't ride this morning; but if you'll put it off until
  afternoon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly! Come up to lunch and we'll ride afterward," he told
  her.</p>

  <p>"You won't go, then, until afternoon?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Ill ride over to the east pasture this morning, and well just take a ride
  any old place that you want to go this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"All right," she replied.</p>

  <p>She had hoped that he would not ride that morning. There was a chance that
  he might see her, even though the east pasture was miles from the trail she
  would ride, for there were high places on both trails, where a horseman would
  be visible for several miles.</p>

  <p>"This noon at lunch, then," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HALF an hour later Custer Pennington swung into the saddle
  and headed the Apache up Sycamore Cañon.</p>

  <p>The trail to the east pasture led through Jackknife. As he passed the spot
  where he had been arrested on the previous Friday night, the man made a wry
  face&mdash;more at the recollection of the ease with which he had been duped
  than because of the fact of his arrest. Being free from any sense of guilt,
  he could view with a certain lightness of spirit that was almost levity the
  mere physical aspects of possible duress. The reality of his service to Eva
  could not but tend to compensate for any sorrow he must feel because of the
  suffering his conviction and imprisonment might bring to his family, so much
  greater must be their sorrow should Eva be permitted to learn the truth.</p>

  <p>When Shannon had broken their engagement for the morning, he had felt a
  disappointment entirely out of proportion to its cause&mdash;a thing which he
  had realized himself, but had been unable to analyze. Now, in anticipation of
  seeing her at noon and riding with her after lunch, he experienced a rise in
  spirits that was equally unaccountable. He liked her very much, and she was
  excellent company&mdash;which, of course, would account for the pleasure he
  derived from being with her. To-day, too, he hoped for an explanation of her
  ride into the mountains the week before, so that there might be no longer any
  shadow on his friendship for her.</p>

  <p>The more he thought about it, the more convinced he was that this
  afternoon she would explain the whole matter quite satisfactorily, and
  presently he found himself whistling as if there were no such places as jails
  or penitentiaries in the whole wide and beautiful world.</p>

  <p>Just then he reached the summit of the trail leading out of Jackknife
  Cañon toward the east pasture. As was his wont, the Apache stopped to breathe
  after the hard climb, and, as seems to be the habit of all horses in like
  circumstances, he turned around and faced in the opposite direction from that
  in which his rider had been going.</p>

  <p>Below and to Custer's right the ranch buildings lay dotted about in the
  dust like children's toys upon a gray rug. Beyond was the castle on the hill,
  shining in the sun, and farther still the soft-carpeted valley, in grays and
  browns and greens. Then the young man's glance wandered to the left and out
  over the basin meadow, and instantly the joy died out of his heart and the
  happiness from his eyes. Straight along the mysterious trail loped a horse
  and rider toward the mountains, and even at that distance he recognized them
  as Baldy and Shannon.</p>

  <p>The force of the shock was almost equivalent to an unexpected blow in the
  face. What could it mean? He recalled her questions. She had deliberately
  sought to learn his plans, as she had that other day, and then, as before,
  she had hastened off to some mysterious rendezvous in the hills.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a hot wave of anger surged through him. Quiet and self-controlled
  as he usually was, there were times when the Pennington temper seized and
  dominated him so completely that he himself was appalled by the acts it
  precipitated. Under its spell a Pennington might commit murder. Now Custer
  did what was almost as foreign to his nature&mdash;he cursed the girl who
  rode on, unconscious of his burning eyes upon her, toward the mountains. He
  cursed her aloud, searching his memory for opprobrious epithets and anathemas
  to hurl after her.</p>

  <p>This was the end. He was through with her forever. What did he know about
  her? What did any of them know about her? She had never mentioned her life or
  associations in the city&mdash;he recalled that now. She had known no one
  whom they knew, and they had taken her in and treated her as a daughter of
  the house, without knowing anything of her; and this was their reward!</p>

  <p>She was doubtless a hireling of the gang that had stolen the whisky and
  disposed of it through Guy. They had sent her here to spy on Guy and to watch
  the Penningtons. It was she who had set the trap in which he had been caught,
  not to save Guy, but to throw the suspicion of guilt upon Custer.</p>

  <p>But for what reason? There was no reason except that he had been selected
  from the first to be the scapegoat when the government officers were too hot
  upon their trail. She had watched him carefully. God, but she had been
  cunning and he credulous! There had been scarce a day that she had not been
  with him. She had ridden the hills with him, and she had kept him from
  following the mysterious trail&mdash;so he reasoned in his rage, though as a
  matter of fact she had done nothing of the sort; but anger and hate are
  blind, and Custer Pennington was angry and filled with hate. Unreasoning rage
  consumed him.</p>

  <p>He believed that he never had hated before as he hated this girl now, so
  far to the other extreme had the shock of her duplicity driven his regard for
  her. He would see her just once more, and he would tell her what he thought
  of her, so that there might be no chance that she would ever again enter the
  home of the Penningtons. He must see to that before he went away, that Eva
  might not be exposed to the influence of such a despicable character.</p>

  <p>But he could not see her to-day. He could not trust himself to see her,
  for even in his anger he remembered that she was a woman, and that when he
  saw her he must treat her as a woman. If she had been within reach when he
  first discovered her, a moment since, he could have struck her, choked
  her.</p>

  <p>With the realization, the senseless fury of his anger left him. He turned
  the Apache away, and headed him again toward the east pasture; but deep
  within his heart was a cold anger that was quite as terrible, though in a
  different way.</p>

  <p>Shannon Burke rode up the trail toward the camp of the smugglers, all
  unconscious that there looked down upon her from a high ridge behind eyes
  filled with hate and loathing&mdash;the eyes of the man she loved.</p>

  <p>She put Baldy up the steep trail that had so filled her with terror when
  she first scaled it, and down upon the other side into the grove of oaks that
  had hidden the camp; but now there was no camp there&mdash;only the debris
  that always marks the stopping place of men.</p>

  <p>As she reached the foot of the trail, she saw Bartolo standing beneath a
  great oak, awaiting her. His pony stood with trailing reins beneath the tree.
  A rifle butt protruded from a boot on the right of the saddle. He came
  forward as she guided Baldy toward the tree.</p><a id="pic4"

  <p><i>"Buenos dias, señorita,"</i> he greeted her, twisting his pock-marked
  face into the semblance of a smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you want of me?" Shannon demanded.</p>

  <p>"I need money," he said. "You get money from Evans. He got all the money
  from the hootch we take down two weeks ago. We never get no chance to get it
  from him."</p>

  <p>"I'll get you nothing!"</p>

  <p>"You get money now&mdash;and whenever I want it," said the Mexican, "or I
  tell about Crumb. You Crumb's woman. I tell how you peddle dope. I know! You
  do what I tell you, or you go to the pen. <i>Sabe</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," said the girl. "I didn't come up here to take orders
  from you. I came to give you orders."</p>

  <p>"What?" exclaimed the Mexican, and then he laughed aloud. "You give me
  orders? That is damn funny!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is funny. You will enjoy it immensely when I tell you what you
  are to do."</p>

  <p>"Hurry, then; I have no time to waste."</p>

  <p>He was still laughing.</p>

  <p>"You are going to find some way to clear Mr. Pennington of the charge
  against him. I don't care what the way is, so long as it does not incriminate
  any other innocent person. If you can do it without getting yourself in
  trouble, well and good. I do not care; but you must see that there is
  evidence given before the grand jury next Wednesday that will prove Mr.
  Pennington's innocence!"</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" inquired Bartolo, grinning broadly.</p>

  <p>"That is all."</p>

  <p>"And if I don't do it&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"Then I shall go before the grand jury and tell them about you, and
  Allen&mdash;about the opium and the morphine and the cocaine&mdash;how you
  smuggled the stolen booze from the ship off the coast up into the
  mountains."</p>

  <p>"You think you would do that?" he asked. "But how about me? Wouldn't I be
  telling everything I know about you? Allen would testify, too, and they would
  make Crumb come and tell how you lived with him. Oh, no, I guess you don't
  tell the grand jury nothing!"</p>

  <p>"I shall tell them everything. Do you think I care about myself? I will
  tell them all that Allen or Crumb could tell; and listen, Bartolo&mdash;I can
  tell them something more. There used to be five men in your gang. There were
  three when I came up last week, and Allen is in jail; but where is the
  other?"</p>

  <p>The man's face went black with anger, and perhaps with fear, too.</p>

  <p>"What you know about that?" he demanded sharply.</p>

  <p>"Allen told Crumb the first time he came to the Hollywood bungalow that he
  was having trouble among his gang, that you were a hard lot to handle, and
  that already one named Bartolo had killed one named Gracial. How would you
  like me to tell that to the grand jury?"</p>

  <p>"You never tell that to no one!" growled the Mexican. "You know too damn
  much for your health!"</p>

  <p>He had stepped suddenly forward and seized her wrist. She struck at him
  and at the same time put the spurs to Baldy&mdash; in her fear and excitement
  more severely than she had intended. The high-spirited animal, unused to such
  treatment, leaped forward past the Mexican, who, clinging to the girl's
  wrist, dragged her from the saddle. Baldy turned, and feeling himself free,
  ran for the trail that led toward home.</p>

  <p>"You know too damn much!" repeated Bartolo. "You better off up here
  alongside Gracial!"</p>

  <p>The girl had risen to her feet and stood facing him. There was no fear in
  her eyes. She was very beautiful, and her beauty was not lost upon the
  Mexican.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you would kill me to keep me from telling the truth about
  you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Should I die instead? If you had kept your mouth shut, you would
  have been all right; but now"&mdash;he shrugged suggestively&mdash;"you
  better off up here beside Gracial."</p>

  <p>"They'll get you and hang you for it," she said.</p>

  <p>"Who will know?"</p>

  <p>"The boy who brought me the message from you."</p>

  <p>"He will not tell. He my son."</p>

  <p>"I wrote a note and left it in my desk before I came up here, telling
  everything, for fear of something of this sort," she said.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" he accused, correctly; "but for fear you did, I go down and
  burn your house to-night, after I get through with <i>you</i>. The ground
  pretty hard after the hot weather&mdash;it take me long time to dig a hole
  beside Gracial!"</p>

  <p>The girl was at her wits' end now. Her pitiful little lie had not availed.
  She began to realize that nothing would avail. She had made the noose, stuck
  her head into it, and sprung the trap. It was too late to alter the
  consequences. The man had the physique of a bull&mdash;she could not hope to
  escape him by recourse to any power other than her wits, and in the first
  effort along that line she had failed miserably and put him on his guard.</p>

  <p>Her case appeared hopeless. She thought of pleading with him, but realized
  the futility of it. The fact that she did not do so indicated her courage,
  which had not permitted her to lose her head. She saw that it was either his
  life or hers, as he saw the matter, and that it was going to be hers was
  obvious.</p>

  <p>The man stood facing her, holding her by the wrist. His eyes appraised her
  boldly.</p>

  <p>"You damn good-looking," he said, and pulled the girl toward him. "Before
  I kill you, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He threw an arm about her roughly, and, leaning far over her as she pulled
  away, he sought to reach her lips with his.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Apache had taken but a few steps on the trail toward the
  east pasture when Custer reined him in suddenly and wheeled him about.</p>

  <p>"I'll settle this thing now," he muttered. "I'll catch her with them. I'll
  find out who the others are. By God, I've got her now, and I've got
  them!"</p>

  <p>He spurred the Apache into a lope along the steep and dangerous declivity
  leading downward into the basin. The horse was surprised. Never before had he
  been allowed to go down hill faster than a walk&mdash;his sound forelegs
  attested the careful horsemanship of his rider.</p>

  <p>Where the trail wound around bushes, he took perilous jumps on the steep
  hillside, for his speed was too great to permit him to make the short turns.
  He cleared them, and somehow he stuck to the trail beyond. His iron shoes
  struck fire from half embedded boulders.</p>

  <p>A rattler crossing the trail ahead coiled, buzzing its warning. The
  hillside was steep&mdash;there was no footing above or below the snake. The
  Apache could not have stopped in time to save himself from those poisoned
  fangs. A coward horse would have wheeled and gone over the cliff; but the
  Morgan is no coward.</p>

  <p>The rider saw the danger at the instant the horse did. The animal felt the
  spurs touch him lightly, he heard a word of encouragement from the man he
  trusted. As the snake struck, he rose, gathering his four feet close to his
  belly, and cleared the danger spot far out of reach of the needle- like
  fangs.</p>

  <p>The trail beyond was narrow, rocky, and shelving&mdash;the thing could not
  have happened in a worse place. The Apache lit, stumbled, slipped. His off
  hind foot went over the edge. He lunged forward upon his knees.</p>

  <p>Only the cool horsemanship of his rider saved them both. A pound of weight
  thrown in the wrong direction would have toppled the horse to the bottom of
  the rocky gorge; a heavy hand upon the bit would have accomplished the same
  result. Pennington sat easily the balanced seat that gave the horse the best
  chance to regain his footing. His touch upon the bit was only sufficient to
  impart confidence to his mount, giving the animal's head free play, as nature
  intended, as he scrambled back to the trail again.</p>

  <p>At last they reached the safer footing of the basin, and were off in a
  straight line for the ravine into which led the mysterious trail. The Apache
  knew that there was need for haste&mdash;an inclination of his master's body,
  a closing of the knees against his barrel, the slight raising of the bridle
  hand, had told him this more surely than loud cries of the punishment of
  steel rowels. He flattened out and flew.</p>

  <p>The cold rage that gripped Pennington brooked no delay. He was glad,
  though, that he was unarmed; for he knew that when he came face to face with
  the men with whom Shannon Burke had conspired against him, he might again
  cease to be master of his anger.</p>

  <p>They reached the foot of the acclivity terminating at the summit of the
  ridge beyond which lay the camp of the bootleggers. Again the man urged his
  mount to the necessity of speed. The powerful beast leaped upward along the
  steep trail, digging his toes deep into the sunbaked soil, every muscle in
  his body strained to the limit of its powers.</p>

  <p>At the summit they met Baldy, head and tail erect, snorting and riderless.
  The appearance of the horse and his evident fright bespoke something amiss.
  Custer had seen him just as he was emerging from the upper end of the dim
  trail leading down the opposite side of the hogback. He turned the Apache
  into it and headed him down toward the oaks.</p>

  <p>Below, Shannon was waging a futile fight against the burly Bartolo. She
  struck at his face and attempted to push him from her, but he only laughed
  his crooked laugh and pushed her slowly toward the trampled dust of the
  abandoned camp.</p>

  <p>"Before I kill you...." he repeated again and again, as if it were some
  huge joke.</p>

  <p>He heard the sound of the Apache's hoofs upon the trail above, but he
  thought it the loose horse of the girl. Custer was almost at the bottom of
  the trail when the Mexican glanced up and saw him. With a curse, he hurled
  Shannon aside and leaped toward his pony.</p>

  <p>At the same instant the girl saw the Apache and his rider, and in the next
  she saw Bartolo seize his rifle and attempt to draw it from its boot. Leaping
  to her feet, she sprang toward the Mexican, who was cursing frightfully
  because the rifle had stuck and he could not readily extricate it from the
  boot. As she reached him, he succeeded in jerking the weapon free. Swinging
  about, he threw it to his shoulder and fired at Pennington, just as Shannon
  threw herself upon him, clutching at his arms and dragging the muzzle of the
  weapon downward. He struck at her face, and tried to wrench the rifle from
  her grasp; but she clung to it with all the desperation that the danger
  confronting the man she loved engendered.</p>

  <p>Custer had thrown himself from the saddle and was running toward them.
  Bartolo saw that he could not regain the rifle in time to use it. He struck
  the girl a terrible blow in the face that sent her to the ground. Then he
  turned and vaulted into his saddle, and was away across the bottom and up the
  trail on the opposite side before Pennington could reach him and drag him
  from his pony.</p>

  <p>Custer turned to the girl lying motionless upon the ground. He knelt and
  raised her in his arms. She had fainted, and her face was very white. He
  looked down into it&mdash;the face of the girl he hated. He felt his arms
  about her, he felt her body against his, and suddenly a took of horror filled
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>He laid her back upon the ground, and stood up. He was trembling
  violently. As he had held her in his arms, there had swept over him an almost
  irresistible desire to crush her to him, to cover her eyes and cheeks with
  kisses, to smother her lips with them&mdash;the girl he hated!</p>

  <p>A great light had broken upon his mental horizon&mdash;a light of
  understanding that left all his world in the dark shadow of despair. He loved
  Shannon Burke!</p>

  <p>Again he knelt beside her, and very gently he lifted her in his arms until
  he could support her across one shoulder. Then he whistled to the Apache, who
  was nibbling the bitter leaves of the live oak. When the horse came to him,
  he looped the bridle reins about his arm and started on foot up the trail
  down which he had just ridden, carrying Shannon across his shoulder. At the
  summit of the ridge he found Baldy grazing upon the sparse, burned grasses of
  late September.</p>

  <p>It was then that Shannon Burke opened her eyes. At first, confused by the
  rush of returning recollections, she thought that it was the Mexican who was
  carrying her; but an instant later she recognized the whipcord riding
  breeches and the familiar boots and spurs of the son of Ganado. Then she
  stirred upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I am all right now," she said. "You may put me down. I can walk."</p>

  <p>He lowered her to the ground, but he still supported her as they stood
  facing each other.</p>

  <p>"You came just in time," she said. "He was going to kill me."</p>

  <p>"I am glad I came," was all that he said.</p>

  <p>She noticed how tired and pinched Custer's face looked, as if he had risen
  from a sick bed after a long period of suffering. He looked older&mdash;very
  much older&mdash;and oh, so sad! It wrung her heart; but she did not question
  him. She was waiting for him to question her, for she knew that he must
  wonder why she had come here, and what the meaning of the encounter he had
  witnessed; but he did not ask her anything, beyond inquiring whether she
  thought she was strong enough to sit her saddle if he helped her mount.</p>

  <p>"I shall be all right now," she assured him.</p>

  <p>He caught Baldy and assisted her into the saddle: Then he mounted the
  Apache and led the way along the trail toward home. They were halfway across
  the basin meadow before either spoke. It was Shannon who broke the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"You must have wondered what I was doing up there," she said, with a
  backward nod of her head.</p>

  <p>"That would not be strange, would it?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you."</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "It is bad enough that you went there to- day and the
  Saturday before I was arrested. Anything more that you could tell me would
  only make it worse. Do you remember that girl I told you about&mdash;that
  friend of Cousin William&mdash;who visited us?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I followed you up here to-day to tell you the same thing I told her."</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said.</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," he snapped, almost angrily. "You understand
  nothing. I only said that I followed to tell you that I have not told you,
  have I? Well, I don't intend to tell you; but my shame that I don't is enough
  without you telling me any more to add to it. There can be no honorable
  excuse for your having come here that other time, or this time, either. There
  is no reason in the world why a woman should have any dealings with
  criminals, or any knowledge that would make dealings with them possible. That
  is the reason I don't want you to tell me more. Oh, Shannon"&mdash;his voice
  broke&mdash;"I don't want to hear anything bad about you!... Please!"</p>

  <p>She had been upon the verge of just anger until then. Even now she did not
  understand&mdash;only that he wanted to believe in her, however much he
  doubted her, and that their friendship had meant more to him than she had
  imagined.</p>

  <p>"But I must tell you, Custer," she insisted. "Now that you have learned
  this much, I can see that your suspicions wrong me more than I deserve. I
  came here the Saturday before you were arrested to warn them that you were
  going to watch for them on the following Friday. Though I did not know the
  men, I knew what sort they were, and that they would kill you the moment they
  found that they were discovered. It was only to save your life that I came
  that other time, and this time I came to try to force them to go before the
  grand jury and clear you of the charge against you; but when I threatened the
  man, and he found what I knew about him, he said that he would kill me."</p>

  <p>"You did not know that I was going to be arrested that night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Custer, how could you believe that of me?" exclaimed Shannon.</p>

  <p>"I didn't want to believe it."</p>

  <p>"I came into all this information&mdash;about the work of this
  gang&mdash;by accidentally overhearing a conversation in Hollywood, months
  ago. I know the names of the principals, I know Guy's connection with them.
  To-day I was trying to keep Guy's name out, too, if that were possible; but
  he is guilty and you are not. I cannot understand how he could come back from
  Los Angeles without telling them the truth and removing the suspicion from
  you."</p>

  <p>"I would not let him," said Pennington.</p>

  <p>"You would not let him? You would go to the penitentiary for the crime of
  another?"</p>

  <p>"Not for him, but for Eva. Guy and I thrashed it all out. He wanted to
  give himself up&mdash;he almost demanded that I should let him; but it can't
  be done. Eva must never know."</p>

  <p>"But, Custer, you can't go! It wouldn't be fair&mdash;it wouldn't be
  right. I won't let you go! I know enough to clear you, and I shall go before
  the grand jury on Wednesday and tell all I know."</p>

  <p>"No," he said. "You must not. It would involve Guy."</p>

  <p>"I won't mention Guy."</p>

  <p>"But you will mention others, and they will mention Guy&mdash; don't doubt
  that for a minute" He turned suddenly toward her. "Promise me, Shannon, that
  you will not go&mdash;that you will not mention what you know to a living
  soul. I would rather go to the pen for twenty years than see Eva's life
  ruined. You don't know her. She's gay and happy and frivolous on the outside;
  but deep within her is a soul of wondrous sensitiveness and beauty, which is
  fortified and guarded by her pride and her honor. Strike down one of these,
  and you will have given her soul a wound from which it may never recover. She
  can understand neither meanness nor depravity in men and women. Should she
  ever learn that Guy had been connected with this gang, and that the money
  upon which they were to start their married life was the fruits of his
  criminality, it would break her heart. I know that Guy isn't criminally
  inclined, and that this will be a lesson that will keep him straight as long
  as he lives; but she wouldn't look at it that way. Now do you see why you
  must not tell what you know?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right, but it seems to me she would not suffer any more
  if Guy went than if her brother went. She loves you very much."</p>

  <p>"But she will know that I am innocent. If Guy went, she would know that he
  was guilty."</p>

  <p>Shannon had no answer to this, and they were silent for a while.</p>

  <p>"You will help me to keep this from Eva?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>She was thinking of the futility of her sacrifice, and wondering what
  explanation he was putting upon her knowledge of the activities of the
  criminals. He had said that there could be no reason in the world why a woman
  should have any dealings with such men, or any knowledge that would make
  dealings with them possible. What would he think of her if he knew the
  truth?</p>

  <p>The man's mind was a chaos of conflicting thoughts&mdash;the sudden
  realization of a love that was as impossible as it was
  unwelcome&mdash;recollection of his vows to Grace, which were as binding upon
  his honor as the marriage vows themselves would have been&mdash;doubts as to
  the character and antecedents of this girl who rode at his side to-day, and
  whose place in his life had suddenly assumed an importance beyond that of any
  other.</p>

  <p>Then he turned a little, his eyes rested upon her profile, and he found it
  hard to doubt her.</p>

  <p>Shannon felt his eyes upon her, and looked up.</p>

  <p>"You have been so good to me, Custer, all of you&mdash;you can never know
  how I have valued the friendship of the Penningtons, or what it has meant to
  me, or how I have striven to deserve it. I would have done anything to repay
  a part, at least, of what it has done for me. That was what I was trying to
  do&mdash;that is why I wanted to go before the grand jury, no matter what the
  cost to me; but I failed, and perhaps I have only made it worse. I do not
  even know that you believe me."</p>

  <p>"I believe you, Shannon," he said. "There is much that I do not
  understand; but I believe that what you did was done in our interests. There
  is nothing more that any of us can do now but keep still about what we know,
  for the moment one of those actually responsible is threatened with exposure
  Guy's name will be divulged&mdash;you may rest assured of that. They would be
  only too glad to shift the responsibility to his shoulders."</p>

  <p>"But you will make some effort to defend yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I shall simply plead not guilty, and tell the truth about why I was up
  there when the officers arrested me."</p>

  <p>"You will make no other defense?"</p>

  <p>"What other defense can I make that would not risk incriminating Guy?"
  Custer asked her.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. It seemed quite hopeless.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FEDERAL officers searching the hills found the camp above
  Jackknife Cañon. They collected a number of empty bottles bearing labels
  identical with those on the bottles in the cases carried by the burros, and
  those found in Custer Pennington's room. That was all they discovered, except
  that the camp was located on the Pennington property.</p>

  <p>The district attorney, realizing the paucity of evidence calculated to
  convict the prisoner on any serious charge, was inclined to drop the
  prosecution; but the prohibition enforcement agents, backed by a band of
  women, most of whom had never performed a woman's first duty to the state and
  society, and therefore had ample time to meddle in affairs far beyond the
  scope of their intellects, seized upon the prominence of the Pennington name
  to gain notoriety for themselves on the score that the conviction of a member
  of a prominent family would have an excellent moral effect upon the community
  at large.</p>

  <p>Just how they arrived at this conclusion it is difficult to discern.
  Similarly one might argue that if it could be proved that the Pope was a
  pickpocket, it would be tremendously effective in regenerating the morals of
  the world.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, the works of the righteous were not without fruit, for
  on the 12th of October Custer Pennington was found guilty and sentenced to
  six months in the county jail for having had several hundred dollars' worth
  of stolen whisky in his possession. He was neither surprised nor
  disheartened. His only concern was for the sensibilities of his family, and
  these&mdash;represented at the trial in the person of his father&mdash;seemed
  far from overwhelmed, for the colonel was unalterably convinced of his son's
  innocence.</p>

  <p>Eva, who had remained at home with her mother, was more deeply affected
  than the others, though through a sense of injustice rather than of shame.
  Shannon, depressed by an unwarranted sense of responsibility for the wrong
  that Custer had suffered, and chagrined that force of circumstances should
  have prevented her from saving the Penningtons from a stain upon their
  escutcheon, found it increasingly difficult to continue her intimacy with
  these loved friends. Carrying in her heart the knowledge and the proof of his
  innocence, she regarded herself as a traitor among them, and in consequence
  held herself more and more aloof from their society, first upon one pretext
  and then upon another.</p>

  <p>At a loss to account for her change toward them, Eva, in a moment of
  depression, attributed it to the disgrace of Custer's imprisonment.</p>

  <p>"She is ashamed to associate with the family of a&mdash;a&mdash;
  jailbird!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe anything of the kind," replied the colonel. "Shannon's
  got too much sense, and she's too loyal. That's all damned poppycock!"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure she couldn't feel that way," said Mrs. Pennington. "She has been
  just as positive in her assertions of Custer's innocence as any of us."</p>

  <p>"You might as well think the same about Guy," said the colonel. "He's
  scarcely been up here since Custer's arrest."</p>

  <p>"He's very busy on a new story. Anyway, I asked him about that very thing,
  and offered to break the engagement if he felt our disgrace too keenly to
  want to marry into the family."</p>

  <p>The colonel drew her down to his knee.</p>

  <p>"You silly little girl!" he said. "Do you suppose that this has made any
  difference in the affection that Guy or any other of our real friends feel
  for us? Not in the slightest. Even if Cus were guilty, they would not change.
  Those who did we would be better off not to know. I am rather jealous of the
  Pennington honor myself, but I have never felt that this affair is any
  reflection upon it, and you need not."</p>

  <p>"But I can't help it, popsy. My brother, my dear brother, in jail with a
  lot of thieves and murderers and horrible people like that! It is just too
  awful! I lie awake at night thinking about it. I am ashamed to go to the
  village, for fear some one will point at me and say, 'There goes the girl
  whose brother is in jail!'"</p>

  <p>"You are taking it much too hard, dear," said her mother. "One would think
  that our boy was really guilty."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if he really were, I should kill myself!"</p>

  <p>The only person, other than the officious reformers, to derive any
  happiness from young Pennington's fate was Slick Allen. He occupied a cell
  not far from Custer's, and there were occasions when they were thrown
  together. Several times Allen saw fit to fling gibes at his former employer,
  much to the amusement of his fellows. They were usually indirect.</p>

  <p>One day, as Custer was passing, Allen remarked in a loud tone:</p>

  <p>"There's a lot more of these damn fox-trottin' dudes that put on airs, but
  ain't nothin' but common thieves!"</p>

  <p>Pennington turned and faced him.</p>

  <p>"You remember what you got the last time you tried calling me names,
  Allen? Well, don't think for a minute that just because we're in jail I won't
  hand you the same thing again some day, if you get too funny. The trouble
  with you, Allen, is that you are laboring under the misapprehension that you
  are a humorist. You're not, and if I were you I wouldn't make faces at the
  only man in this jail who knows about you, and Bartolo, and&mdash;Gracial.
  Don't forget Gracial!"</p>

  <p>Allen paled, and his eyes closed to two very narrow slits. He made no more
  observations concerning Pennington; but he devoted much thought to him,
  trying to arrive at some reasonable explanation of the man's silence, when it
  was evident that he must have sufficient knowledge of the guilt of others to
  clear himself of the charge upon which he had been convicted.</p>

  <p>To Allen's hatred of Custer was now added a real fear, for he had been
  present when Bartolo killed Gracial. The other two witnesses had been
  Mexicans, and Allen had no doubt but that if Bartolo were accused, the three
  of them would swear that the American committed the murder.</p>

  <p>One of the first things to do, when he was released from jail, would be to
  do away with Bartolo. Bartolo disposed of, the other witnesses would join
  with Allen to lay the guilt upon the departed. Such pleasant thoughts
  occupied the time and mind of Slick Allen, as did also his plans for paying
  one Wilson Crumb a little debt he felt due this one-time friend.</p>

  <p>Nor was Crumb free from apprehension for the time that would see Allen's
  jail sentence fulfilled. He well knew the nature of the man. It is typical of
  drug addicts to disregard the effect of their acts further than the immediate
  serving of their own interests, and the director had encompassed Allen's
  arrest merely to meet the emergency of the moment. Later, as time gave him
  the opportunity to consider what must inevitably follow Allen's release, he
  began to take thought as to means whereby he might escape the just deserts of
  his treachery.</p>

  <p>He knew enough of Allen's activities to send the man to a Federal prison
  for a long term, but these matters he could not divulge without equally
  incriminating himself. There was, however, one little item of Allen's past
  which might be used against him without signal danger to Crumb, and that was
  the murder of Gracial. It would not be necessary for Crumb to appear in the
  matter at all. An anonymous letter to the police would suffice to direct
  suspicion of the crime toward Allen, and to insure for Crumb, if not
  permanent immunity, at least a period of reprieve.</p>

  <p>With the natural predilection of the weak for avoiding or delaying the
  consummation of their intentions, Crumb postponed the writing of this letter
  of accusation. There was no cause for hurry, he argued, since Allen's time
  would not expire until the 6th of the following August.</p>

  <p>Crumb led a lonely life after the departure of Gaza. His infatuation for
  the girl had as closely approximated love as a creature of his type could
  reach. He had come to depend upon her, and to look forward to finding her at
  the Vista del Paso bungalow on his return from the studio. Since her
  departure his evenings had been unbearable, and with the passing weeks he
  developed a hatred for the place that constantly reminded him of his loss. He
  had been so confident that she would have to return to him after she had
  consumed the small quantity of morphine he had allotted her that only after
  the weeks had run into months did he realize that she had probably gone out
  of his life forever. How she had accomplished it he could not understand,
  unless she had found means of obtaining the narcotic elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Not knowing where she had gone, he had no means of searching for her. In
  his own mind, however, he was convinced that she must have returned to Los
  Angeles. Judging others by himself, he could conceive of no existence that
  would be supportable beyond the limits of a large city, where the means for
  the gratification of his vice might be obtained.</p>

  <p>That Gaza de Lure had successfully thrown off the fetters into which he
  had tricked her never for a moment entered his calculations. Finally,
  however, it was borne in upon him that there was little likelihood of her
  returning; and so depressing had become the familiar and suggestive
  furnishings of the Vista del Paso bungalow that he at last gave it up, stored
  his furniture, and took a room at a local hotel. He took with him, carefully
  concealed in a trunk, his supply of narcotics&mdash;which he did not find it
  so easy to dispose of since the departure of his accomplice.</p>

  <p>During the first picture in which Grace Evans had worked with him, Crumb
  had become more and more impressed with her beauty and the subtle charm of
  her refinement, which appealed to him by contrast with the ordinary
  surroundings and personalities of the K.K.S. studio. There was a quiet
  restfulness about her which soothed his diseased nerves, and after Gaza's
  desertion he found himself more and more seeking her society. As was his
  accustomed policy, his attentions were at first so slight, and increased by
  such barely perceptible degrees, that, taken in connection with his uniform
  courtesy, they gave the girl no warning of his ultimate purposes.</p>

  <p>The matter of the test had shocked and disgusted her for the moment; but
  the thing having been done, and no harm coming from it, she began to consider
  even that with less revulsion than formerly. The purpose of it she had never
  been able to fathom; but if Crumb had intended it to place him insidiously
  upon a plane of greater intimacy with the girl, he had succeeded. That the
  effect was subjective rendered it none the less effective.</p>

  <p>Added to these factors in the budding intimacy between the director and
  the extra girl was the factor which is always most potent in similar
  associations&mdash;the fear that the girl holds of offending a potent ally,
  and the hope of propitiating a power in which lies the potentiality of
  success upon the screen.</p>

  <p>Lunches at Frank's, dinners at the Ship, dances at the Country Club, led
  by easy gradations to more protracted parties at the Sunset Inn and the Green
  Mill. The purposes of Crumb's shrewdly conceived and carefully executed plan
  were twofold. Primarily, he sought a companionship to replace that of which
  Gaza de Lure had robbed him. Secondarily, he needed a new tool to assist in
  the disposal of the considerable store of narcotics that he had succeeded in
  tricking Allen and his accomplices into delivering to him with the
  understanding that he would divide the profits of the sales with
  them&mdash;which, however, Crumb had no intention of doing if he could
  possibly avoid it.</p>

  <p>In much the same manner that he had tricked Gaza de Lure, he tricked Grace
  Evans into the use of cocaine; and after that the rest was easy. Renting
  another and less pretentious bungalow on Circle Terrace, he installed the
  girl there, and transferred the trunk of narcotics to her care, retaining his
  room at the hotel for himself.</p>

  <p>Grace's fall was more easily accomplished than in the case of Gaza, and
  was more complete, for the former had neither the courage nor the strength of
  character that had enabled the other to withstand the more degrading advances
  of her tempter. To assume that the girl made no effort to oppose his
  importunings would be both unfair and unjust, for both heredity and training
  had endowed her with a love of honor and a horror of the sordidness of vice;
  but the gradual undermining of her will by the subtle inroads of narcotics
  rendered her powerless to withstand the final assault upon the citadel of her
  scruples.</p>

  <p>One evening, toward the middle of October, they were dining together at
  the Winter Garden. Crumb had bought an evening paper on the street, and was
  glancing through it as they sat waiting for their dinner to be served.
  Presently he looked up at the girl seated opposite him.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you come from a little jerk-water place up the line, called
  Ganado?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded affirmatively.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Here's a guy from there been sent up for bootlegging&mdash; fellow by the
  name of Pennington."</p>

  <p>She half closed her eyes, as if in pain.</p>

  <p>"I know," she said. "It has been in the newspapers for the last couple of
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"Did you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he has been out to see me since his arrest, and he called up
  once."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I would be ashamed to see any decent person!"</p>

  <p>"Decent!" snorted Crumb. "You don't call a damned bootlegger decent, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe he ever did it," said the girl. "I have known him all my
  life, and his family. I'm certain that he couldn't have done it."</p>

  <p>A sudden light came into Crumb's eye.</p>

  <p>"By God!" he exclaimed, bringing his fist down upon the table.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" Grace inquired. "Well, wouldn't that get you?" he
  exclaimed. "I never connected you at all!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"This fellow Pennington may not be guilty, but I know who is."</p>

  <p>"How do you know? I don't understand you. Why do you look at me that
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if that isn't the best ever!" exclaimed the man. "And here you have
  been handing me a long line of talk about the decent family you came from,
  and how it would kill them if they knew you sniffed a little coke now and
  then. Well, wouldn't that get you? You certainly are a fine one to
  preach!"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand you," said the girt "What has this to do with me? I am
  not related to Mr. Pennington, but it would make no difference if I were, for
  I know he never did anything of the sort. The idea of a Pennington
  bootlegging! Why, they have more money than they need, and always have
  had."</p>

  <p>"It isn't Pennington who ought to be in jail," he said. "It's your
  brother."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise, and then she laughed.</p>

  <p>"You must have been hitting it up strong to-day, Wilson," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I haven't; but it's funny I never thought of it before. Allen
  told me a long while ago that a fellow by the name of Evans was handling the
  hootch for him. He said he got a job from the Penningtons as stable man in
  order to be near the camp where they had the stuff cached in the hills. He
  described Evans as a young blood, so I guess there isn't any doubt about it.
  You have a brother&mdash;I've heard you speak of him."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," she said.</p>

  <p>"It don't make any difference whether you believe me or not. I could put
  your brother in the pen, and they've only got Pennington in the county jail.
  All they could get on him, according to this article, was having stolen goods
  in his possession; but your brother was in on the whole proposition. It was
  hidden in his hay barn. He delivered it to a fellow who came up there every
  week, ostensibly to get hay, and your brother collected the money. Gosh,
  they'd send him up for sure if I ever tipped them off to what I know!"</p>

  <p>And thus was fashioned the power he used to force her to his will.</p>

  <p>A week later the bungalow on Circle Terrace was engaged, and Grace Evans
  took up the work of peddling narcotics, which Shannon Burke had laid down a
  few months before. With this difference&mdash;Gaza de Lure had shared in the
  profits of the traffic, while Grace Evans got nothing more than her living,
  and what drugs she craved for her personal use.</p>

  <p>Her life, her surroundings, every environment of this new and terrible
  world into which her ambition had introduced her, tended rapidly to ravish
  her beauty. She faded with a rapidity that was surprising even to
  Crumb&mdash;surprising and annoying. He had wanted her for her beauty, and
  now she was losing it; but still he must keep her, because of her value in
  his nefarious commerce.</p>

  <p>As weeks and months went by, he no longer took pleasure in her society,
  and was seldom at the bungalow save when he came to demand an accounting and
  to collect the proceeds of her sales. Her pleas and reproaches had no other
  effect upon him than to arouse his anger. One day, when she clung to him,
  begging him not to desert her, he pushed her roughly from him so that she
  fell, and in falling she struck the edge of a table and hurt
  herself.</p><a id="pic5"

    <p class="caption">He pushed her roughly from him so that she fell.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>This happened in April. On the following day Custer Pennington, his term
  in the county jail expired, was liberated.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CUSTER'S long hours of loneliness had often been occupied
  with plans against the day of his liberation. That Grace had not seen him or
  communicated with him since his arrest and conviction had been a source of
  wonder and hurt to him. He recalled many times the circumstance of the
  telephone call, with a growing belief that Grace had been there, but had
  refused to talk with him. Nevertheless, he was determined to see her before
  he returned to Ganado.</p>

  <p>He had asked particularly that none of his family should come to Los
  Angeles on the day of his release, but that the roadster should be sent up on
  the preceding day and left in a garage for him. He lost no time, after
  quitting the jail, in getting his machine and driving out to Hollywood, to
  the house where Grace had boarded.</p>

  <p>The woman who answered his ring told him that Grace no longer lived there.
  At first she was loath to give him any information as to the girl's
  whereabouts; but after some persuasion she gave him a number on Circle
  Terrace, and in that direction Pennington turned his car.</p>

  <p>As he left his car before the bungalow, and approached the building, he
  could see into the interior through the screen door, for it was a warm day in
  April, and the inner door was open. As he mounted the few steps leading to
  the porch, he saw a woman cross the living room, into which the door opened.
  She moved hurriedly, disappearing through a doorway opposite and closing the
  door after her. Though he had but a brief glimpse of her in the darkened
  interior, he knew that it was Grace, so familiar were every line of her
  figure and every movement of her carriage.</p>

  <p>It was several minutes after Custer rang before a Japanese appeared at the
  doorway. It was the same Japanese "schoolboy" who had served as general
  factotum at the Vista del Paso bungalow. He opened the screen door a few
  inches and looked inquiringly at the caller.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see Miss Evans," said Custer.</p>

  <p>He took a card case from his pocket and handed a card to the servant, who
  looked blankly at the card and then at the caller, finally shaking his head
  stupidly and closing the door.</p>

  <p>"No here," he said. "Nobody home."</p>

  <p>Pennington recalled once more the affair of the telephone. He knew that he
  had just seen Grace inside the bungalow. He had come to talk with her, and he
  intended to do so.</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on the handle of the door and jerked it open. The Jap,
  evidently lacking in discretion, endeavored to prevent him from entering.
  First the guardian clawed at the door in an effort to close it, and then,
  very foolishly, he attempted to push Pennington out on the porch. The results
  were disastrous to the Jap.</p>

  <p>Crossing the living room, Custer rapped on the door through which he had
  seen Grace go, calling her by name. Receiving no reply, he flung the door
  open. Facing him was the girl he was engaged to marry.</p>

  <p>With her back against the dresser, Grace stood at the opposite end of the
  room. Her disheveled hair fell about her face, which was overspread with a
  sickly pallor. Her wild, staring eyes were fixed upon him. Her mouth,
  drooping at the corners, tremulously depicted a combination of terror and
  anger.</p>

  <p>"Grace!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She still stood staring at him for a moment before she spoke.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean," she demanded at last, "by breaking into my bedroom?
  Get out! I don't want to see you. I don't want you here!"</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and put a hand upon her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My God, Grace," he cried, "what is the matter? What has happened to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened," she mumbled. "There is nothing the matter with me.
  I suppose you want me to go back with the rest of the rubes. I am through
  with the damned country&mdash;and country jakes, too!" she added.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you don't want me here, Grace? That you don't love me?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Love you?" She broke into a disagreeable laugh. "Why, you poor rube, I
  never want to see you again!"</p>

  <p>He stood looking at her for a moment longer, and then he turned slowly and
  walked out of the bungalow and down to his car. When he had gone, the girl
  threw herself face down upon the bed and burst into uncontrollable sobs. For
  the moment she had risen triumphant above the clutches of her sordid vice.
  For that brief moment she had played her part to save the man she loved from
  greater torture and humiliation in the future&mdash;at what a price only she
  could ever know.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Custer found them waiting for him on the east porch as he
  drove up to the ranch house. The new freedom and the long drive over the
  beautiful highway through the clear April sunshine, with the green hills at
  his left and the lovely valley spread out upon his right hand, to some extent
  alleviated the depression that had followed the shock of his interview with
  Grace; and when he alighted from the car he seemed quite his normal self
  again.</p>

  <p>Eva was the first to reach him. She fairly threw herself upon her brother,
  laughing and crying in a hysteria of happiness. His mother was smiling
  through her tears, while the colonel blew his nose violently, remarking that
  it was "a hell of a time of year to have a damned cold!"</p>

  <p>Custer joked a little about his imprisonment, but he soon saw that the
  mere mention of it had a most depressing effect upon Eva; so he did not
  revert to the subject again in her presence. He confined himself to plying
  them with a hundred questions about happenings on the ranch during his long
  absence, the condition of the stock, and the crop outlook for the season.</p>

  <p>As he considered the effect his undeserved jail sentence had produced upon
  the sensibilities of his sister, he was doubly repaid for the long months of
  confinement that he had suffered in order to save her from the still greater
  blow of having the man she was to marry justly convicted of a far more
  serious crime. He saw no reason now why she should ever learn the truth. The
  temporary disgrace of his incarceration would soon be forgotten in the
  everyday run of work and pleasure that constituted the life of Ganado, and
  the specter of her hurt pride would no longer haunt her.</p>

  <p>Custer was surprised that Guy and Mrs. Evans had not been of the party
  that welcomed his return. When he mentioned this, Eva told him that Mrs.
  Evans thought the Penningtons would want to have him all to themselves for a
  while, and that their neighbors were coming up after dinner. And it was not
  until dinner that he asked after Shannon.</p>

  <p>"We have seen very little of her since you left," explained his mother.
  "She returned Baldy soon after that, and bought the Senator from Mrs.
  Evans."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what is the matter with the child," said the colonel. "She
  is as sweet as ever when we do see her, and she always asks after you and
  tells us that she believes in your innocence. She rides a great deal at
  night, but seldom, if ever, in the daytime. I don't think it is safe for a
  woman to ride alone in the hills at night, and I have told her so; but she
  says that she is not afraid, and that she loves the hills as well by night as
  by day."</p>

  <p>"Eva has missed her company very much," said Mrs. Pennington. "I was
  afraid that we might have done something to offend her, but none of us could
  think what it could have been."</p>

  <p>"I thought she was ashamed of us," said Eva.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Of coarse that's nonsense," said Custer. "She knows as well as the rest
  of you that I was innocent."</p>

  <p>He was thinking how much more surely Shannon knew his innocence than any
  of them.</p>

  <p>During dinner Eva regained her old-time spirit. More than once the tears
  came to Mrs. Pennington's eyes as she realized that once more their little
  family was united, and that the pall of sorrow that had weighed so heavily
  upon them for the past six months had at last lifted, revealing again the
  sunshine of the daughter's heart, which had never been the same since their
  boy had gone away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Cus!" exclaimed Eva. "The most scrumptious thing is going to happen,
  and I'm so glad that you are going to be here too. It's going to be perfectly
  gorgeristic! There's be a whole regiment of them, and they're going to be
  camped right up at the mouth of Jackknife. I can scarcely wait until they
  come&mdash;can you?"</p>

  <p>"I think I might manage," said her brother; "at least until you tell me
  what you are talking about."</p>

  <p>"Pictures," exclaimed Eva. "Isn't it simplimetic gorgeristic? And they may
  be here a whole month!"</p>

  <p>"What in the world is the child talking about?" asked Custer, appealing to
  his mother.</p>

  <p>"Your father&mdash;" Mrs. Pennington started to explain.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't tell him"; cried Eva. "I want to tell him myself."</p>

  <p>"You have been explaining for several minutes," said Custer; "but you
  haven't said anything yet."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll start at the beginning, then. They're going to have Indians,
  and cowboys, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That sounds more like the finish," suggested Custer.</p>

  <p>"Don't interrupt me! They're going to take a picture on Ganado."</p>

  <p>Custer turned toward his father with a look of surprise.</p>

  <p>"You needn't blame papa," said Eva. "It was all my fault&mdash;or, rather,
  I should say our good fortune is all due to me. You see, papa wasn't going to
  let them come at first, but the cutest man came up to see him&mdash;a nice,
  shorty fat little man, and he rubbed his hands together and said: 'Vell,
  colonel?' Papa told him that he had never allowed any picture companies on
  the place; but I happened to be there, and that was all that saved us, for I
  teased and teased and teased until finally papa said that they could come,
  provided they didn't take any pictures up around the house. They didn't want
  to do that, for they're making a Western picture, and they said the scenery
  at the back of the ranch is just what they want. They're coming up in a few
  days, and it's going to be perfectly radiant, and maybe I'll get in the
  pictures!"</p>

  <p>"If I thought so," said Custer, "I'd put a can of nitroglycerine under the
  whole works the moment they drove on to the property!"</p>

  <p>He was thinking of what the pictures had done for Grace Evans.</p>

  <p>"I am surprised that you permitted it, father," he said, turning to the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>"I'm rather surprised myself," admitted the older Pennington; "but what
  was I to do, with that suave little location manager rubbing his hands and
  oiling me on one side, and this little rascal here pestering the life out of
  me on the other? I simply had to give in. I don't imagine any harm will come
  from it. They've promised to be very careful of all the property, and
  whenever any of our stock is used it will be handled by our own men."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they are going to pay you handsomely for it," suggested
  Custer.</p>

  <p>The colonel smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, that wasn't exactly mentioned," he said; "but I have a recollection
  that the location manager said something about presenting us with a fine set
  of stills of the ranch."</p>

  <p>"Generous of them!" said Custer. "They'll camp all over the shop, use our
  water, burn our firewood, and trample up our pasture, and in return they'll
  give us a set of photographs. Their liberality is truly marvelous!"</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth," said the colonel, "after I found how
  anxious Eva was, I wouldn't have dared mention payment, for fear they might
  refuse to come and this young lady's life might be ruined in
  consequence!"</p>

  <p>"What outfit is it?" asked the son.</p>

  <p>"It's a company from the K.K.S., directed by a man by the name of
  Crumb."</p>

  <p>"Wilson Crumb, the famous actor-director," added Eva. "How perfectly
  radiant! I danced with him is Los Angeles a year ago."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's the fellow, is it?" said Custer. "I have a hazy recollection
  that you were mad about him for some fifteen minutes after you reached home,
  but I have never heard you mention him since."</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth," said Eva, "I had forgotten all about him
  until that perfectly gorgeous little loquacious manager mentioned him."</p>

  <p>"Location manager," corrected her father.</p>

  <p>"He was both."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was," said the colonel. "I rather hope he comes back. I haven't
  enjoyed any one so much since the days of Weber and Fields."</p>

  <p>It was after eight o'clock when the Evanses arrived. Mrs. Evans was
  genuinely affected at seeing Custer again, for she was as fond of him as if
  he had been her own son. In Guy, Custer discovered a great change. The boy
  that he had left had become suddenly a man, quiet and reserved, with a shadow
  of sadness in his expression. His lesson had been a hard one, Custer knew,
  and the price that he had had to pay for it had left its indelible mark upon
  his sensitive character.</p>

  <p>Guy's happiness at having Custer back again was overshadowed to some
  extent by the shame that he must always feel when he looked into the face of
  the man who had shouldered his guilt and taken the punishment which should
  have been his. The true purpose of Pennington's sacrifice could never alter
  young Evans's realization of the fact that the part he had been forced to
  take had been that of a coward, a traitor, and a cad.</p>

  <p>The first greetings over, Mrs. Evans asked Custer if he had seen Grace
  before he left Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>"I saw her," he said, "and she is not at all well. I think Guy should go
  up there immediately, and try to bring her back. I meant to speak to him
  about it this evening."</p>

  <p>"She is not seriously ill?" exclaimed Mrs. Evans.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say," replied Custer. "I doubt if she is seriously ill in a
  physical sense, but she is not well. I could see that. She has changed a
  great deal. I think you should lose no time, Guy," he added, turning to
  Grace's brother, "in going to Los Angeles and getting her. She has been gone
  almost a year. It is time she knew whether her dreams are to come true or
  not. From what I saw of her, I doubt if they have materialized."</p>

  <p>"I will go to-morrow," said young Evans.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE six months that had just passed had been months of
  indecision and sadness for Shannon Burke. Constantly moved by a conviction
  that she should leave the vicinity of Ganado and the Penningtons, she was
  held there by a force that she had not the power to overcome.</p>

  <p>Never before since she had left her mother's home in the Middle West had
  she experienced the peace and content and happiness that her little orchard
  on the highway imparted to her life. The friendship of the Penningtons had
  meant more to her than anything that had hitherto entered her life; and to be
  near them, even if she saw them but seldom, constituted a constant bulwark
  against the assaults of her old enemy, which still occasionally assailed the
  ramparts of her will.</p>

  <p>After the departure of Custer she had conscientiously observed what she
  considered to be his wishes as expressed in his reference comparing her with
  the girl friend of Cousin William, whom he had practically ordered out of the
  house. She had as far as possible avoided Eva's society; and though
  contemplation of the cause of this avoidance filled her with humiliation, and
  with a sense of the injustice of all that it implied, she nevertheless felt
  it a duty to the man she loved to respect his every wish, however indirectly
  suggested.</p>

  <p>That she might put herself in Eva's way as seldom as possible, Shannon had
  formed the habit of riding at those hours at which the Penningtons were not
  accustomed to ride. The habit of solitude grew upon her, and she loved the
  loneliness of the hills. They never oppressed her&mdash;she never feared
  them. They drew her to them and soothed her as a mother might have done.
  There she forgot her sorrows, and hope was stimulated to new life.</p>

  <p>Especially when the old craving seized her did she long for the hills, and
  it was because of this that she first rode at night&mdash;on a night of
  brilliant moonlight that imparted to familiar scenes the weird beauties of a
  strange world. The experience was unique. It assumed the proportions of an
  adventure, and it lured her to other similar excursions.</p>

  <p>Even the Senator felt the spell of enchantment. He stepped daintily with
  uppricked ears and arched neck, peering nervously into the depth of each
  shadowy bush. He leaped suddenly aside at the movement of a leaf, or halted,
  trembling and snorting, at the moon-bathed outlines of some jutting rock that
  he had passed a hundred times, unmoved, by day.</p>

  <p>The moonlight rides led Shannon to others on moonless nights, so that she
  was often in the saddle when the valley slept. She invariably followed the
  same trail on these occasions, with the result that both she and the Senator
  knew every foot of it so well that they had traversed it beneath the
  blackness of heavy clouds, or when low fogs obliterated all but the nearest
  objects.</p>

  <p>Never, in the hills, could her mind dwell upon depressing thoughts. Only
  cheerful reflections were her companions of those hours of solitude. She
  thought of the love that had come into her life, of the beauty of it, and of
  all that it had done to make life more worth the living; of the Penningtons
  and the example of red-blooded cleanliness that they set&mdash;decency
  without prudery; of her little orchard and the saving problems it had brought
  to occupy her mind and hands; of her horse and her horsemanship, two
  never-failing sources of companionship and pleasure which the Penningtons had
  taught her to love and enjoy.</p><br>

  <p class="first">On the morning after Custer's return, Guy started early for
  Los Angeles, while Custer&mdash;Shannon not having joined them on their
  morning ride&mdash;re-saddled the Apache after breakfast and rode down to her
  bungalow. He both longed to see her and dreaded the meeting; for, regardless
  of Grace's attitude and of the repulse she had given him, his honor bound him
  to her. Loyalty to the girl had been engendered by long years of association,
  during which friendship had grown into love by so gradual a process that it
  seemed to each of them that there had never been a time when they had not
  loved. Such attachments, formed in the heart of youth, hallowed by time, and
  fortified by the pride and honor of inherited chivalry, become a part of the
  characters of their possessors, and as difficult to uproot as those other
  habits of thought and action which differentiate one individual from
  another.</p>

  <p>Custer had realized, in that brief interview of the day before, that Grace
  was not herself. What was the cause of her change he could not guess, since
  he was entirely unacquainted with the symptoms of narcotics. Even bad a
  suspicion of the truth entered his mind, he would have discarded it as a vile
  slander upon the girl, as he had rejected the involuntary suggestion that she
  might have been drinking. His position was distressing for a man to whom
  honor was a fetish, since he knew that he still loved Grace, while at the
  same time realizing a still greater love for Shannon.</p>

  <p>She saw him coming and came down the driveway to meet him, her face
  radiant with the joy of his return, and with that expression of love that is
  always patent to all but the object of its concern.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Custer!" she cried. "I am so glad that you are home again! It has
  seemed years and years, rather than months, to all of us."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to be home, Shannon. I have missed you, too. I have missed you
  all&mdash;everything&mdash;the hills, the valley, every horse and cow and
  little pig, the clean air, the smell of flowers and sage&mdash;all that is
  Ganado."</p>

  <p>"You like it better than the city?"</p>

  <p>"I shall never long for the city again," he said. "Cities are wonderful,
  of course, with their great buildings, their parks and boulevards, their fine
  residences, their lawns and gardens. The things that men have accomplished
  there fill a fellow with admiration; but how pitiful they really are compared
  with the magnificence that is ours!"</p>

  <p>He turned and pointed toward the mountains.</p>

  <p>"Just think of those hills, Shannon, and the infinite, unthinkable power
  that uplifted such mighty monuments. Think of the countless ages that they
  have endured, and then compare them with the puny efforts of man. Compare the
  range of vision of the city dweller with ours. He can see across the street,
  and to the top of some tall building, which may look imposing; but place it
  beside one of our hills, and see what becomes of it. Place it in a ravine in
  the high Sierras, and you would have difficulty in finding it; and you cannot
  even think of it in connection with a mountain fifteen or twenty thousand
  feet in height. And yet the city man patronizes us country people, deploring
  the necessity that compels us to pursue our circumscribed existence."</p>

  <p>"Pity him," laughed Shannon. "He is as narrow as his streets. His ideals
  can reach no higher than the pall of smoke that hangs over the roofs of his
  buildings. I am so glad, Custer, that you have given up the idea of leaving
  the country for the city!"</p>

  <p>"I never really intended to," he replied. "I couldn't have left, on
  father's account; but now I can remain on my own as well as his, and with a
  greater degree of contentment. You see that my recent experience was a
  blessing in disguise."</p>

  <p>"I am glad if some good came out of it; but it was a wicked injustice, and
  there were others as innocent as you who suffered fully as much&mdash;Eva
  especially."</p>

  <p>"I know," he said. "She has been very lonely since I left, with Grace
  away, too; and they tell me that you have constantly avoided them. Why? I
  cannot understand it."</p>

  <p>He had dismounted and tied the Apache, and they were walking toward the
  porch. She stopped, and turned to look Custer squarely in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"How could I have done otherwise?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," he replied.</p>

  <p>She could not hold her eyes to his as she explained, but looked down, her
  expression changing from happiness to one of shame and sadness.</p>

  <p>"You forget that girl, the friend of Cousin William?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Shannon!" he cried, laying a hand impulsively upon her arm. "I told
  you that I wouldn't say that to you. I didn't want you to stay away. I have
  implicit confidence in you."</p>

  <p>"No," she contradicted him. "In your heart you thought it, and perhaps you
  were right."</p>

  <p>"No," he insisted. "Please don't stay away&mdash;promise me that you will
  not! You have hurt them all, and they are all so fond of you!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Custer. I would not hurt them. I love them all; but I thought
  I was doing the thing that you wished. There was so much that you did not
  understand&mdash;that you can never understand&mdash;and you were away where
  you couldn't know what was going on; so it seemed disloyal to do the thing I
  thought you would rather I didn't do."</p>

  <p>"It's all over now," he said. "Let's start over again, forgetting all that
  has happened in the last six months and a half."</p>

  <p>Again, as his hand lay upon her arm, he was seized with an almost
  uncontrollable desire to crush her to him. Two things deterred him&mdash;his
  loyalty to Grace, and the belief that his love would be unwelcome to
  Shannon.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">GUY EVANS swept over the broad, smooth highway at a rate
  that would have won him ten days in the jail at Santa Ana had his course led
  him through that village. The impression that Custer's words had implanted in
  his mind was that Grace was ill, for Pennington had not gone into the details
  of his unhappy interview with the girl, choosing to leave to her brother a
  realization of her changed condition, which would have been incredible to him
  even from the lips of so trusted a friend as Custer.</p>

  <p>And so it was that when he approached the bungalow on Circle Terrace, and
  saw a coupé standing at the curb, he guessed at what it portended; for though
  there were doubtless hundreds of similar cars in the city, there was that
  about this one which suggested the profession of its owner. As Guy hurried up
  the walk to the front door, he was as positive that he would find Grace ill
  and a doctor in attendance, as if some one had already told him so.</p>

  <p>There was no response to his ring, and as the inner door was open he
  entered. A door on the opposite side of the living room was ajar. As Guy
  approached it, a man appeared in the doorway, and beyond him the visitor
  could see Grace lying, very white and still, upon a bed.</p>

  <p>"Who are you&mdash;this woman's husband?" demanded the man in curt
  tones.</p>

  <p>"I am her brother. What is the matter? Is she very ill?"</p>

  <p>"Did you know of her condition?"</p>

  <p>"I heard last night that she was not well, and I hurried up here. I live
  in the country. Who are you? What has happened? She is not&mdash;my God, she
  is not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Perhaps we can save her. I am a doctor. I was called by a
  Japanese, who said that he was a servant here. He must have left after he
  called me, for I have not seen him. Her condition is serious, and requires an
  immediate operation&mdash;an operation of such a nature that I must learn the
  name of her own physician and have him present. Where is her husband?"</p>

  <p>"Husband! My sister is not&mdash;" Guy ceased speaking, and went suddenly
  white. "My God, doctor, you don't mean that she&mdash;that my
  sister&mdash;oh, no, not that!"</p>

  <p>He seized the other's arm beseechingly. The doctor laid his hand upon the
  younger man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"She had a fall night before last, and an immediate operation is
  imperative. Her condition is such that we cannot even take the risk of moving
  her to a hospital. I have my instruments in my car, but I should have help.
  Who is her doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"I'll get some one. I have given her something to quiet her."</p>

  <p>The doctor stepped to the telephone and gave a number. Evans entered the
  room where his sister lay. She was moving about restlessly and moaning,
  though it was evident that she was still unconscious.</p>

  <p>Changed! Guy wondered that he had known her at all, now that he was closer
  to her. Her face was pinched and drawn. Her beauty was gone&mdash;every
  vestige of it. She looked old and tired and haggard, and there were terrible
  lines upon her face that stilled her brother's heart and brought the tears to
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>He heard the doctor summoning an assistant and directing him to bring
  ether. Then he heard him go out of the house by the front door&mdash;to get
  his instruments, doubtless. The brother knelt by the girl's bed.</p>

  <p>"Grace!" he whispered, and threw an arm about her.</p>

  <p>Her lids fluttered, and she opened her eyes,</p>

  <p>"Guy!"</p>

  <p>She recognized him&mdash;she was conscious.</p>

  <p>"Who did this?" he demanded. "What is his name?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What is the use?" she asked. "It is done."</p>

  <p>"Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"You would kill him&mdash;and be punished. It would only make it
  worse&mdash;for&mdash;you&mdash;and mother. Let it die with me!"</p>

  <p>"You are not going to die. Tell me, who is he? Do you love him?"</p>

  <p>"I hate him!"</p>

  <p>"How were you injured?"</p>

  <p>"He threw me&mdash;against&mdash;a table."</p>

  <p>Her voice was growing weaker. Choking back tears of grief and anger, the
  young man rose and stood beside her.</p>

  <p>"Grace, I command you to tell me!"</p>

  <p>His voice was low, but it was vibrant with power and authority. The girl
  tried to speak. Her lips moved, but she uttered no sound. Guy thought that
  she was dying, and taking her secret to the grave.</p>

  <p>Her eyes moved to something beyond the foot of the bed, back to his, and
  back again to whatever she had been looking at, as if she sought to direct
  his attention to something in that part of the room. He followed the
  direction of her gaze. There was a dressing table there, and on it a
  photograph of a man in a silver frame. Guy stepped to the table and picked up
  the picture.</p>

  <p>"This is he?"</p>

  <p>His eyes demanded an answer. Her lips moved soundlessly, and weakly she
  nodded an affirmative.</p>

  <p>"What is his name?"</p>

  <p>She was too weak to answer him. She gasped, and her breath came
  flutteringly. The brother threw himself upon his knees beside the bed, and
  took her in his arms. His tears mingled with his kisses on her cheek. The
  doctor came then and drew him away.</p>

  <p>"She is dead!" said the boy, turning away and covering his face with his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"No," said the doctor, after a brief examination. "She is not dead. Get
  into the kitchen, and get some water to boiling. I'll be getting things ready
  in here. Another doctor will be here in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Glad of something to do, just to help, Guy hastened into the little
  kitchen. He found a kettle and a large pan, and put water in them to
  boil.</p>

  <p>A moment later the doctor came in. He had removed his coat and vest and
  rolled up his sleeves. He placed his instruments in the pan of water on the
  stove, and then he went to the sink and washed his hands. While he scrubbed,
  he talked. He was an efficient-looking, businesslike person, and he inspired
  Guy with confidence and hope.</p>

  <p>"She has a fighting chance," he said. "I've seen worse cases pull through.
  She's had a bad time, though. She must have been lying here for pretty close
  to twenty-four hours without any attention. I found her fully dressed on her
  bed&mdash;fully dressed except for what clothes she'd torn off in her pain.
  If some one had called a doctor yesterday at this time, it might have been
  all right. It may be all right even now. We'll do the best we can."</p>

  <p>The bell rang.</p>

  <p>"That's the doctor. Let him in, please."</p>

  <p>Guy went to the door and admitted the second physician, who removed his
  coat and vest and went directly to the kitchen. The first doctor was entering
  the room where Grace lay. He turned and spoke to his colleague, greeting him;
  then he disappeared within the adjoining room. The second doctor busied
  himself about the sink, sterilizing his hands. Guy lighted another burner and
  put on another vessel with water in it.</p>

  <p>A moment later the first doctor returned to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"It will not be necessary to operate, doctor," he said. "We were too
  late!"</p>

  <p>His tone and manner were still very businesslike and efficient, but there
  was an expression of compassion in his eyes as he crossed the room and put
  his arm about Guy's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Come into the other room, my boy. I want to talk to you," he said.</p>

  <p>Guy, dry-eyed, and walking almost as one in a trance, accompanied him to
  the little living room.</p>

  <p>"You have had a hard blow," said the doctor. "What I am going to tell you
  may make it harder; but if she had been my sister I should have wanted to
  know about it. She is better off. The chances are that she didn't want to
  live. She certainly made no fight for life&mdash;not since I was called."</p>

  <p>"Why should she want to die?" Guy asked dully. "We would have forgiven
  her. No one would ever have known about it but me."</p>

  <p>"There was something else&mdash;she was a drug addict. That was probably
  the reason why she didn't want to live. The morphine I had to give her to
  quiet her would have killed three ordinary men."</p>

  <p>And so Guy Evans came to know the terrible fate that had robbed his sister
  of her dreams, of her ambition, and finally of her life. He placed the full
  responsibility upon the man whose picture had stood in its silver frame upon
  the girl's dressing table. As he knelt beside the dead girl, he swore to
  search until he had learned the identity of that man, and found him, and
  forced from him the only expiation that could satisfy the honor of a
  brother.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE death of Grace had, of course, its naturally depressing
  effect upon the circle of relatives and friends at Ganado; but her absence of
  more than a year, the infrequency of her letters, and the fact that they had
  already come to feel that she was lost to them, mitigated to some degree the
  keenness of their grief and lessened its outward manifestations. Her pitiful
  end could not seriously interrupt the tenor of their lives, which had long
  since grown over the wound of her departure, as a tree's growth rolls over
  the hurt of a severed limb, leaving only a scar as a reminder of its
  loss.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Evans, Guy and Custer suffered more than the others&mdash;Mrs. Evans
  because of the natural instincts of motherhood, and Custer from a sense of
  loss that seemed to have uprooted and torn away a part of his being, even
  though he realized that his love for Grace had been of a different sort from
  his hopeless passion for Shannon Burke. It was Guy who suffered most, for
  hugged to his breast was the gnawing secret of the truth of his sister's life
  and death. He had told them that Grace had died of pneumonia, and they had
  not gone behind his assertion to search the records for the truth.</p>

  <p>Locked in his desk was the silver frame and the picture of the man whose
  identity he had been unable to discover. The bungalow had been leased in
  Grace's name. The Japanese servant had disappeared, and Guy had been unable
  to obtain any trace of him. The dead girl had had no friends in the
  neighborhood, and there was no one who could tell him anything that might
  lead to the discovery of the man he sought.</p>

  <p>He did not, however, give up his search. He went often to Hollywood, where
  he haunted public places and the entrances to studios, in the hope that some
  day he would find the man he sought; but as the passing months brought no
  success, and the duties of his ranch and his literary work demanded more and
  more of his time, he was gradually compelled to push the furtherance of his
  vengeance into the background, though without any lessening of his
  determination to compass it eventually.</p>

  <p>To Custer, the direct effect of Grace's death was to revive the habit of
  drinking more than was good for him&mdash;a habit from which he had drifted
  away during the past year. That it had ever been a habit he would, of course,
  have been the last to admit. He was one of those men who could drink, or
  leave it alone. The world is full of them, and so are the cemeteries.</p>

  <p>Custer avoided Shannon when he could do so without seeming unfriendly.
  Quite unreasonably, he felt that his love for Shannon was an indication of
  disloyalty to Grace. The latter's dismissal of him he had never taken as a
  serious avowal of her heart. He had realized that the woman who had spoken so
  bitterly had not been the girl he had loved, and whose avowals of love he had
  listened to. Nor had she been the girl upon whose sad, tired face he had
  looked for the last time in the darkened living room of the Evans home, for
  then death had softened the hard lines of dissipation, revealing again, in
  chastened melancholy, the soul that sin had disguised but not destroyed.</p>

  <p>Shannon recognized the change in Custer. She attributed it to his grief,
  and to his increased drinking, which she had sensed almost immediately, as
  love does sense the slightest change in its object, however little apparent
  to another. She did not realize that she was purposely avoiding her. She was
  more than ever with Eva now, for Guy, having settled down to the serious
  occupations of man's estate, no longer had so much leisure to devote to
  play.</p>

  <p>She still occasionally rode at night, for the daytime rides with Custer
  were less frequent now. Much of his time was occupied closer in around the
  ranch, with the conditioning of the show herds for the coming fall&mdash;an
  activity which gave him a plausible excuse for foregoing his rides with
  Shannon. The previous year they had been compelled to cancel their entries
  because of Custer's imprisonment, since the colonel would not make the
  circuit of the shows himself, and did not care to trust the herds to any one
  but his son. Now the Morgans, the Percherons, the Herefords, and the
  Berkshires that were to uphold the fame of Ganado were the center of arduous
  and painstaking fitting and grooming, as the time approached when the
  finishing touches were to be put upon glossy coat and polished horn and
  hoof.</p>

  <p>May, June, and July had come and gone&mdash;it was August again. Guy's
  futile visits to Los Angeles were now infrequent. The life of Ganado had
  again assumed the cheerfulness of the past. The heat of summer had brought
  the swimming pool into renewed demand, and the cool evenings saved the
  ballroom from desertion. The youth of the foothills and valley, re-enforced
  by weekend visitors from the city, filled the old house with laughter and
  happiness. Shannon was always of these parties, for they would not let her
  remain away.</p>

  <p>It was upon the occasion of one of them, early in August, that Eva
  announced the date of her wedding to Guy.</p>

  <p>"The 2nd of September," she told them. "It comes on a Saturday. We're
  going to motor to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" cautioned Guy. "That's a secret!"</p>

  <p>"And when we come back we're going to start building on Hill
  Thirteen."</p>

  <p>"That's a cow pasture," said Custer.</p>

  <p>"Well, it won't be one any more. You must find another cow pasture."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, little one," replied her brother. "Well bring the cows up here
  in the ballroom. With five thousand acres to pick from, you can't find a
  bungalow site anywhere except in the best dairy cow pasture on Ganado!"</p>

  <p>"With five thousand acres to pick from, I suppose you can't find a cow
  pasture anywhere but on the best bungalow site in southern California! You
  radiant brother! You wouldn't have your little sister living in the hog
  pasture, now would you?"</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no! Those nine children you aspire to would annoy the brood
  sows."</p>

  <p>"You're hideous!"</p>

  <p>"Put on a fox trot, some one," cried Guy. "Dance with your sister, Cus,
  and you'll let her build bungalows all over Ganado. No one can refuse her
  anything when they dance with her."</p>

  <p>"I'll say they can't," agreed Custer. "Was that how she lured you to your
  undoing, Guy?"</p>

  <p>"What a dapper little idea!" exclaimed Eva.</p>

  <p>Guy danced that dance with Mrs. Pennington, and the colonel took out
  Shannon. As they moved over the smooth floor with the easy dignity that good
  dancers can impart to the fox trot, the girl's eyes were often on the brother
  and sister dancing and laughing together.</p>

  <p>"How wonderful they are!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Who?" inquired the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Custer and Eva. Theirs is such a wonderful relationship between brother
  and sister&mdash;the way it ought to be, but very seldom is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know that it's unique," replied the colonel. "Guy and Grace
  were that way, and so were my father's children. Possibly it's because we
  were all raised in the country, where children are more dependent upon their
  sisters and brothers for companionship than children of the city. We all get
  better acquainted in the country, and we have to learn to find the best that
  is in each of us, for we haven't the choice of companions here that a city,
  with its thousands, affords."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Shannon. "Perhaps that is it; but anyway it is
  lovely&mdash;really <i>lovely</i>, for they are almost like two lovers. At
  first, when I heard them teasing each other, I used to think there might be
  some bitterness in their thrusts; but when I came to know you all better, I
  realized that your affection was so perfect that there could never be any
  misunderstanding among you."</p>

  <p>"That attitude is not peculiar to the Penningtons," replied the colonel.
  "I know, for instance, of one who so perfectly harmonized with their lives
  and ideals that m less than a year she became practically one of them."</p>

  <p>He was smiling down into Shannon's upturned face.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;you mean me," she said. "It is awfully nice of you, and it
  makes me very proud to hear you say so, for I have really tried to be like
  you. If I have succeeded the least bit, I am so happy!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that you have succeeded in being like us," he laughed; "but
  you have certainly succeeded in being liked <i>by</i> us. Why, do you know,
  Shannon, I believe Mrs. Pennington and I discuss you and plan for you fully
  as much as we do the children. It is almost as if you were our other
  daughter."</p>

  <p>The tears came to her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am so happy!" she said again.</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was later in the evening, after a dance, that she and
  Custer walked out on the driveway along the north side of the ballroom, and
  stood looking out over the moon-enchanted valley&mdash;a vista of loveliness
  glimpsed between masses of feathery foliage in an opening through the trees
  on the hillside just below them. They looked out across the acacias and
  cedars of the lower hill toward the lights of a little village twinkling
  between two domelike hills at the upper end of the valley. It was an
  unusually warm evening, almost too warm to dance.</p>

  <p>"I think we'd get a little of the ocean breeze," said Custer, "if we were
  on the other side of the hill. Let's walk over to the water gardens. There is
  usually a breeze there, but the building cuts us off from it here."</p>

  <p>Side by side, in silence, they walked around the front of the building and
  along the south drive to the steps leading down through the water gardens to
  the stables. The steps were narrow and Custer went ahead&mdash;which is
  always the custom of men in countries where there are rattlesnakes.</p>

  <p>As Shannon stepped from the cement steps to the gravel walk above the
  first pool, her foot came down upon a round stone, turning her ankle and
  throwing her against Custer. For support she grasped his arm. Upon such
  insignificant trifles may the fate of lives depend. It might have been a
  lizard, a toad, a mouse, or even a rattlesnake that precipitated the moment
  which, for countless eons, creation had been preparing; but it was none of
  these. It was just a little round pebble&mdash;and it threw Shannon Burke
  against Custer Pennington, causing her to seize his arm. He felt the contact
  of those fingers, and the warmth of her body, and her cheek near his
  shoulder. He threw an arm about her to support her.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly she had regained her footing. Laughingly she drew
  away.</p>

  <p>"I stepped on a stone," she said in explanation; "but I didn't hurt my
  ankle."</p>

  <p>But still he kept his arm about her. At first Shannon did not understand,
  and, supposing that he still thought her unable to stand alone, she again
  explained that she was unhurt.</p>

  <p>He stood looking down into her face, which was turned up to his. The moon,
  almost full, revealed her features as clearly as sunlight&mdash;how beautiful
  they were, and how close. She had not yet fully realized the significance of
  his attitude when he suddenly threw his other arm about her and crushed her
  to him; and then, before she could prevent, he had bent his lips to hers and
  kissed her full upon the mouth.</p>

  <p>With a startled cry she pushed him away.</p>

  <p>"Custer!" she said. "What have you done? This is not like you. I do not
  understand!"</p>

  <p>She was really terrified&mdash;terrified at the thought that he might have
  kissed her without love&mdash;terrified that he might have kissed her
  <i>with</i> love. She did not know which would be the greater
  catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it, Shannon," he said. "Blame the pebble, blame the
  moonlight, blame me&mdash;it won't make any difference. I couldn't help it;
  that is all there is to it I've fought against it for months. I knew you
  didn't love me; but, oh, Shannon, I love you! I had to tell you."</p>

  <p>He loved her! He had loved her for months! Oh, the horror of it! Her
  little dream of happiness was shattered. No longer could they go on as they
  had. There would always be this between them&mdash;the knowledge of his love;
  and he would learn of her love for him, for she would not lie to him if he
  asked her. Then she would either have to explain or to go away&mdash;to
  explain those hideous months with Crumb. Custer would not believe the
  truth&mdash;no man would believe the truth&mdash;that she had come through
  them undefiled. She herself would not believe it of another woman, and she
  was too sophisticated to hope that the man who loved her would believe it of
  her.</p>

  <p>He had not let her go. They still stood there&mdash;his arms about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Please don't be angry, Shannon," he begged. "You may not want my love,
  but there's no disgrace in it. Maybe I shouldn't have kissed you, but I
  couldn't help it, and I'm glad I did. I have that to remember as long as I
  live. Please don't be angry!"</p>

  <p>Angry! She wished to God that he would crush her to him again and kiss
  her&mdash;kiss her&mdash;kiss like that now and forever. Why shouldn't he?
  Why shouldn't she let him? What had she done to deserve eternal punishment?
  There were countless wives less virtuous than she. Ah, if she could but have
  the happiness of his love!</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and turned away her head, and for just an instant she
  dreamed her beautiful dream. Why not? Why not? Why not? There could be no
  better wife than she, for there could be no greater love than hers.</p>

  <p>He noticed that she no longer drew away. There had been no look of anger
  in her eyes&mdash;only startled questioning; and her face was still so near.
  Again his arms closed about her, and again his lips found hers.</p>

  <p>This time she did not deny him. She was only human&mdash;only a
  woman&mdash;and her love, growing steadily in power for many months, had
  suddenly burst forth in a consuming fire beneath his burning kisses. He felt
  her lips move in a fluttering sob beneath his, and then her dear arms stole
  up about his neck and pressed him closer in complete surrender.</p>

  <p>"Shannon! You love me?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, dear boy, always!"</p>

  <p>He drew her to the lower end of a pool, where a rustic seat stood half
  concealed by the foliage of a drooping umbrella tree. There they sat and
  asked each other the same questions that lovers have asked since prehistoric
  man first invented speech, and that lovers will continue to ask so long as
  speech exists upon earth; very important questions&mdash; by far the most
  important questions in the world.</p>

  <p>They did not know how long they had sat there&mdash;to them it seemed but
  a moment&mdash;when they heard voices calling their names from above.</p>

  <p>"Shannon! Custer! Where are you?"</p>

  <p>It was Eva calling.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we'll have to go," he said. "Just one more kiss!"</p>

  <p>He took a dozen; and then they rose and walked up the steps to the south
  drive.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet, please."</p>

  <p>She was not sure that it would last. Such happiness was too sweet to
  endure.</p>

  <p>Eva spied them.</p>

  <p>"Where in the world have you two been?" she demanded. "We've been hunting
  all over for you, and shouting until I'm hoarse."</p>

  <p>"We've been right down there by the upper pool, trying to cool off,"
  replied Custer. "It's too beastly hot to dance."</p>

  <p>"You never thought so before," said Eva suspiciously. "Do you know, I
  believe you two have been off spooning! How perfectly gorgeristic!"</p>

  <p>"How perfectly nothing," replied Custer. "Old people, like Shannon and me,
  don't spoon. That's for you kids."</p>

  <p>Eva came closer.</p>

  <p>"Shannon, you'd better go and straighten your hair before any one else
  sees you." She laughed and pinched the other's arm. "I'd love it," she
  whispered in Shannon's ear, "if it were true! You'll tell me, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"If it ever comes true, dear"&mdash;Shannon returned the
  whisper&mdash;"you shall be the first to know about it."</p>

  <p>"Scrumptious! But say, I've got the divinest news&mdash;what do you think?
  Popsy has known it all day and never mentioned it&mdash;forgot all about it,
  he said, until just before he and mother trotted off to bed. Did you ever
  hear of anything so outrageous? And now half the folks have gone home, and I
  can't tell 'em. Oh, it's too spiffy for words! I've been longing and longing
  for it for months and months and months, and now it's going to
  happen&mdash;really going to happen&mdash; actually going to happen on
  Monday!"</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, little one, unwind, and get to the end of the
  harrowing story. What's going to happen?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the K.K.S. company is coming on Monday, and Wilson Crumb is coming
  with them!"</p>

  <p>Shannon staggered almost as from the force of a physical blow. Wilson
  Crumb coming! Coming to Ganado! Short indeed had been her sweet
  happiness!</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Shannon?" asked Custer solicitously.</p>

  <p>The girl steadied herself quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's nothing," she said, with a nervous laugh. "I just felt a little
  dizzy for a moment."</p>

  <p>"You had better go in the house and lie down," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, I think I'll go home, if you'll drive me down, Custer. You know ten
  o'clock is pretty late for us."</p>

  <p>"It's Saturday night," said Eva.</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to miss my ride in the morning. You're all going, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Custer.</p>

  <p>He noticed that she was very quiet as they drove down to her place, and
  when they parted she clung to him as if she could not bear to let him go.</p>

  <p>It was very wonderful&mdash;the miracle of this great love. As he drove
  back home, he could not think of anything else. He was not egotistical, and
  it seemed strange that from all the men she must have known Shannon had kept
  her love for him. With Grace it had been different. Their love had grown up
  with them from childhood. It had seemed no more remarkable that Grace should
  love him than that Eva should love him, or that he should love Grace; but
  Shannon had come to him out of a strange world&mdash;a world full of
  men&mdash;where, with her beauty and her charm, she must have been an object
  of admiration to many. Yet she had brought her heart to him intact; for she
  had told him that she had never loved another&mdash;and she had told him the
  truth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER Custer left her, Shannon entered the bungalow and sat
  for a long time before the table on which stood a framed photograph of her
  mother. Never before had she felt the need of loving counsel so sorely as
  now. In almost any other emergency she could have gone to Mrs. Pennington,
  but in this she dared not. She knew the pride of the Penningtons. She
  realized the high altar upon which they placed the purity of their women in
  the sacred temple of their love, and she knew that none but the pure might
  enter.</p>

  <p>In her heart of hearts she knew that she had the right to stand there
  beside his mother or his sister; but the pity of it was that she could never
  prove that right, for who would believe her? Men had been hanged upon
  circumstantial evidence less damning than that which might be arrayed against
  her purity. No&mdash;if ever they should learn of her association with Wilson
  Crumb, they would cast her out of their lives as they would put a leper out
  of their home.</p>

  <p>Not even Custer's love could survive such a blow to his honor and his
  pride. She did not think the less of him because of that, for she was wise
  enough in the ways of the world to know that pride and virtue are oftentimes
  uncompromising, even to narrowness.</p>

  <p>Her only hope, therefore, lay in avoiding discovery by Wilson Crumb during
  his stay at Ganado. Her love, and the weakness it had induced, permitted her
  to accept the happiness from which an unkind fate had hitherto debarred her,
  and to which even now her honor told her she had no right.</p>

  <p>She wished that Custer had not loved her, and that she might have
  continued to live the life that she had learned to love, where she might be
  near him, and might constantly see him in the happy consociation of
  friendship; but with his arms about her and his kisses on her lips she had
  not had the strength to deny him, or to dissimulate the great love which had
  ordered her very existence for many months.</p>

  <p>In the brief moments of bliss that had followed the avowal of his love,
  she had permitted herself to drift without thought of the future; but now
  that the sudden knowledge of the approaching arrival of Crumb had startled
  her into recollection of the past and consideration of its bearings upon the
  future, she realized only too poignantly that the demands of honor required
  that sooner or later she herself must tell Custer the whole sordid story of
  those hideous months in Hollywood. There was no other way. She could not mate
  with a man unless she could match her honor with his. There was no
  alternative other than to go away forever.</p>

  <p>It was midnight before she arose and went to her room. She went
  deliberately to a drawer which she kept locked, and, finding the key, she
  opened it. From it she took the little black case, and, turning back the
  cover, she revealed the phials, the needles, and the tiny syringe that had
  played so sinister a part in her past.</p>

  <p>What she was doing to-night she had done so often in the past year that it
  had almost assumed the proportions of a rite. It had been her wont to parade
  her tempters before her, that she might have the satisfaction of deriding
  them, and of proving the strength of the new will that her love for Custer
  Pennington had been so potent a factor in developing. To-night she went a
  little further. She took a bit of cotton, and, placing it in the bowl of a
  spoon, she dissolved some of the white powder with the aid of a lighted match
  held beneath the spoon, and then she drew the liquid into the syringe.</p>

  <p>Her nerves were overwrought and unstrung from the stress of the
  conflicting emotions they had endured that evening and the risk she took was
  greater than she guessed. And yet, as she looked at the syringe, and realized
  that its contents held surcease of sorrow, that it held quiet and rest and
  peace, she felt only repugnance toward it. Not even remotely did she consider
  the possibility of resorting again to the false happiness of morphine.</p>

  <p>She knew now that she was freer from its temptations than one who had
  never used it; but she felt that after to-night, with the avowal of
  Pennington's love still in her ears, she must no longer keep in her
  possession a thing so diametrically opposed to the cleanliness of his life
  and his character. For months she had retained it as a part of the system she
  had conceived for ridding herself of its power. Without it she might never
  have known whether she could withstand the temptation of its presence; but
  now she had finished with it. She needed it no longer.</p>

  <p>With almost fanatical savagery she destroyed it, crushing the glass phials
  and the syringe beneath her heel and tearing the little case to shreds. Then,
  gathering up the fragments, she carried them to the fireplace in the living
  room and burned them.</p><br>

  <p class="first">On the following day the horses and several loads of
  properties from the K.K.S. studio arrived at Ganado, and the men who
  accompanied them pitched their camp well up in Jackknife Cañon. Eva was very
  much excited, and spent much of her time on horseback, watching their
  preparations. She tried to get Shannon to accompany her, but the latter found
  various excuses to remain away, being fearful that even though Crumb had not
  yet arrived, there might be other employees of the studio who would recognize
  her.</p>

  <p>Crumb and the rest of the company came in the afternoon, although they had
  not been expected until the following day. Eva, who had made Custer ride up
  again with her in the afternoon, recalled to the actor director the occasion
  upon which she had met him, and they had danced together, some year and a
  half before.</p>

  <p>As soon as he met her, Crumb was struck by her beauty, youth, and
  freshness. He saw in her a possible means of relieving the tedium of his
  several weeks' enforced absence from Hollywood&mdash;though in the big
  brother he realized a possible obstacle, unless he were able to carry on his
  purposed gallantries clandestinely.</p>

  <p>In the course of conversation he took occasion to remark that Eva ought to
  photograph well. "I'll let them take a hundred feet of you," he said, "some
  day when you're up here while we're working. We might discover an unsung
  Pickford up here among the hills!"</p>

  <p>"She will remain unsung, then," said Custer curtly. "My sister has no
  desire to go into pictures."</p>

  <p>"How do you know I haven't?" asked Eva.</p>

  <p>"After Grace?" he asked significantly.</p>

  <p>She turned to Crumb.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I wouldn't make much of an actress," she said; "but it would
  be perfectly radiant to see myself in pictures just once!"</p>

  <p>"Good!" he replied. "We'll get you all right some day that you're up here.
  I promise your brother that I won't try to persuade you into pictures."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Custer.</p>

  <p>As he and Eva rode back toward the house, he turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that fellow Crumb," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to say. He just rubs me the wrong way; but I'd bet almost
  anything that he's a cad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think he's perfectly divine!" said Eva with her usual
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Custer grunted.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you," announced Eva, "is that you're jealous of him
  because he's an actor. That's just like you men!"</p>

  <p>Custer laughed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right," he said; "but I don't like him, and I hope you'll
  never go up there alone."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to see them take pictures," replied the girl; "and if I
  can't get any one to go with me, I'm going alone."</p>

  <p>"I don't like the way he looked at you, Eva."</p>

  <p>"You're perfectly silly! He didn't look at me any differently than any
  other man does."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that. I haven't the same keen desire to punch the head
  of every man I see looking at you as I had in his case."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're prejudiced! I'll bet anything he's just perfectly
  lovely!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">Next morning, finding no one with the leisure or inclination
  to ride with her, Eva rode up again to the camp. They had already commenced
  shooting. Although Crumb was busy, he courteously took the time to explain
  the scene on which they were working, and many of the technical details of
  picture-making. He had a man hold her horse while she came and squinted
  through the finder. In fact, he spent so much time with her that he
  materially delayed the work of the morning. At the same time the infatuation
  that had had its birth on the preceding day grew to greater proportions in
  his diseased mind.</p>

  <p>He asked her to stay and lunch with them. When she insisted that she must
  return home, he begged her to come again in the afternoon. Although she would
  have been glad to do so, for she found the work that they were doing novel
  and interesting, she declined his invitation, as she already had made
  arrangements for the afternoon.</p>

  <p>He followed her to her horse, and walked beside her down the road a short
  distance from the others.</p>

  <p>"If you can't come down this afternoon," he said, "possibly you can come
  up this evening. We are going to take some night pictures. I hadn't intended
  inviting any one, because the work is going to be rather difficult and
  dangerous, and an audience might distract the attention of the actors; but if
  you think you could get away alone, I should be very glad to have you come up
  for a few minutes about nine o'clock. We shall be working in the same place.
  Don't forget," he repeated, as she started to ride away, "that for this
  particular scene I really ought not to have any audience at all; so if you
  come, please don't tell any one else about it."</p>

  <p>"I'll come," she said. "It's awfully good of you to ask me, and I won't
  tell a soul."</p>

  <p>Crumb smiled as he turned back to his waiting company.</p>

  <p>Brought up in the atmosphere that had surrounded her since birth,
  unacquainted with any but honorable men, and believing as she did that all
  men are the chivalrous protectors of all women, Eva did not suspect the guile
  that lay behind the director's courteous manner and fair words. She looked
  upon the coming nocturnal visit to the scene of their work as nothing more
  than a harmless adventure; nor was there, from her experience, any cause for
  apprehension, since the company comprised some forty or fifty men and women
  who, like any one else, would protect her from any harm that lay in their
  power to avert.</p>

  <p>Her conscience did not trouble her in the least, although she regretted
  that she could not share her good fortune with the other members of her
  family, and deplored the necessity of leaving the house surreptitiously, like
  a thief in the night. Such things did not appeal to Pennington standards; but
  Eva satisfied these qualms by promising herself that she would tell them all
  about it at breakfast the next morning.</p>

  <p>After lunch that day Custer went to his room, and, throwing himself on his
  bed with a book, with the intention of reading for half an hour, fell
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterward Shannon Burke, feeling that there would be no danger of
  meeting any of the K.K.S. people at the Pennington house, rode up on the
  Senator to keep her appointment with Eva. As she tied her horse upon the
  north side of the house, Wilson Crumb stopped his car opposite the patio at
  the south drive. He had come up to see Colonel Pennington for the purpose of
  arranging for the use of a number of the Ganado Herefords in a scene on the
  following day.</p>

  <p>Not finding Eva in the family sitting room, Shannon passed through the
  house and out into the patio, just as Wilson Crumb mounted the two steps to
  the arcade. Before either realized the presence of the other they were face
  to face, scarce a yard apart.</p>

  <p>Shannon went deathly white as she recognized the man beneath his make-up,
  while Crumb stood speechless for a moment.</p>

  <p>"My God, Gaza. You!" he presently managed to exclaim. "What are you doing
  here? Thank God I have found you at last!"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she begged. "Please don't speak to me. I am living a decent life
  here."</p>

  <p>He laughed in a disagreeable manner.</p>

  <p>"Decent!" he scoffed. "Where you getting the snow? Who's putting up for
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't use it any more," she said.</p>

  <p>"The hell you don't! You can't put that over on me! Some other guy is
  furnishing it. I know you&mdash;you can't get along two hours without it. I'm
  not going to stand or this. There isn't any guy going to steal my girl!"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Wilson!" she cautioned. "For God's sake keep still! Some one might
  hear you."</p>

  <p>"I don't give a damn who hears me. I'm here to tell the world that no one
  is going to take my girl away from me. I've found you, and you're going back
  with me, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>She came very close to him, her eyes blazing wrathfully.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going back with you, Wilson Crumb," she said. "If you tell, or if
  you ever threaten me again in any way, I'll kill you. I managed to escape
  you, and I have found happiness at last, and no one shall take it away from
  me!"</p>

  <p>"What about my happiness? You lived with me two years. I love you, and, by
  God, I'm going to have you, if I have to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A door slammed behind them, and they both turned to see Custer Pennington
  standing in the arcade outside his door, looking at them.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, his voice chilling. "Did I interrupt?"</p>

  <p>"This man is looking for some one, Custer," said Shannon, and turned to
  reenter the house.</p>

  <p>Confronted by a man, Crumb's bravado had vanished. Intuitively he guessed
  that he was looking at the man who had stolen Gaza from him; but he was a
  very big young man, with broad shoulders and muscles that his flannel shirt
  and riding breeches did not conceal. Crumb decided that if he was going to
  have trouble with this man, it would be safer to commence hostilities at a
  time when the other was not looking.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "I was looking for your father, Mr. Pennington."</p>

  <p>"Father is not here. He has driven over to the village. What do you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see if I could arrange for the use of some of your Herefords
  to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>Pennington was leading the way toward Crumb's car.</p>

  <p>"You can find out about that," he said, "or anything else that you may
  wish to know, from the assistant foreman, whom you will usually find up at
  the other end, around the cabin. If he is in doubt about anything, he will
  consult with us personally; so that it will not be necessary, Mr. Crumb, for
  you to go to the trouble of coming to the house again."</p>

  <p>Custer's voice was level and low. It carried no suggestion of anger, yet
  there was that about it which convinced Crumb that he was fortunate in not
  having been kicked off the hill physically rather than verbally&mdash;for
  kicked off he had been, and advised to stay off, into the bargain.</p>

  <p>He wondered how much Pennington had overheard of his conversation with
  Gaza. Shannon Burke, crouching in a big chair in the sitting room, was
  wondering the same thing.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Custer had overheard practically all of the
  conversation. The noise of Crumb's car had awakened him, but almost
  immediately he had fallen into a doze, through which the spoken words
  impinged upon his consciousness without any actual, immediate realization of
  their meaning, of the identity of the speakers. The moment that he became
  fully awake, and found that he was listening to a conversation not intended
  for his ears, he had risen and gone into the patio.</p>

  <p>When finally he came into the sitting room, where Shannon was, he made no
  mention of the occurrence, except to say that the visitor had wanted to see
  his father. It did not seem possible to Shannon that he could have failed to
  overhear at least a part of their conversation, for they were standing not
  more than a couple of yards from the open window of his bedroom, and there
  was no other sound breaking the stillness of the August noon. She was sure
  that he had heard, and yet his manner indicated that he had not.</p>

  <p>She waited a moment to see if he would be the first to broach the subject,
  but he did not. She determined to tell him then and there all that she had to
  tell, freeing her soul and her conscience of their burden, whatever the cost
  might be.</p>

  <p>She rose and came to where he was standing, and, placing a hand upon his
  arm, looked up into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Custer," she said. "I have something to tell you. I ought to have told
  you before, but I have been afraid. Since last night there is no alternative
  but to tell you."</p>

  <p>"You do not have to tell me anything that you do not want to tell me," he
  said. "My confidence in you is implicit. I could not both love and distrust
  at the same time."</p>

  <p>"I must tell you," she said. "I only hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where in the world have you been, Shannon?" cried Eva, breaking suddenly
  into the sitting room. "I have been away down to your place looking for you.
  I thought you were going to play golf with me this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"That's what I came up for," said Shannon, turning toward her.</p>

  <p>"Well, come on, then! We'll have to hurry, if we're going to play eighteen
  holes this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Custer Pennington went to his room again after the girls had driven off in
  the direction of the Country Club. He wondered what it had been that Shannon
  wished to tell him. Round and round in his mind rang the words of Wilson
  Crumb:</p>

  <p>"You lived with me two years&mdash;you lived with me two years&mdash;you
  lived with me two years!"</p>

  <p>She had been going to explain that, he was sure; but she did not have to
  explain it. The girl that he loved could have done no wrong. He trusted her.
  He was sure of her.</p>

  <p>But what place had that soft-faced cad had in her life? It was unthinkable
  that she had ever known him, much less that they had been upon intimate
  terms.</p>

  <p>Custer went to his closet and rummaged around for a bottle. It had been
  more than two weeks since he had taken a drink. The return to his old
  intimacy with Shannon, and the frequency with which he now saw her had again
  weaned him from his habit; but to-day he felt the need of a drink&mdash;of a
  big drink, stiff and neat.</p>

  <p>He swallowed the raw liquor as if it had been so much water. He wished now
  that he had punched Crumb's head when he had had the chance. The cur! He had
  spoken to Shannon as if she were a common woman of the streets&mdash;Shannon
  Burke&mdash; Custer's Shannon!</p>

  <p>Feeling no reaction to the first drink, he took another.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to get my fingers on his throat!" he thought. "Before I choked
  the life out of him, I'd drag him up here and make him kiss the ground at her
  feet!"</p>

  <p>But no, he could not do that. Others would see it, and there would have to
  be explanations; and how could he explain it without casting reflections on
  Shannon?</p>

  <p>For hours he sat there in his room, nursing his anger, his jealousy, and
  his grief; and all the time he drank and drank again. He went to his closet,
  got his belt and holster, and from his dresser drawer took a big, ugly-
  looking forty-five&mdash;a Colt's automatic. For a moment he stood holding it
  in his hand, looking at it. Almost caressingly he handled it, and then he
  slipped it into the holster at his hip, put on his hat, and started for the
  door.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CUSTER'S gait showed no indication of the amount that he had
  drunk. He was a Pennington of Virginia, and he could carry his liquor like a
  gentleman. Even though he was aflame with the heat of vengeance, his
  movements were slow and deliberate. At the door he paused, and, turning,
  retraced his steps to the table where stood the bottle and the glass.</p>

  <p>The bottle was empty. He went to the closet and got another. Again he
  drank, and as he stood there by the table he commenced to plan again.</p>

  <p>There must be some reason for the thing he contemplated. There must be
  some reason so logical that the discovery of his act could in no way reflect
  upon Shannon Burke, or draw her name into the publicity which must ensue. It
  required time to think out a feasible plan, and time gave opportunity for
  additional drinks.</p>

  <p>The colonel and Mrs. Pennington were away somewhere down in the valley.
  Eva and Shannon were the first to return. In passing along the arcade by
  Custer's open window, Eva saw him lying on his bed. She called to him, but he
  did not answer. Shannon was at her side.</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you suppose is the matter with Custer?" asked
  Eva.</p>

  <p>They saw that he was fully dressed. His hat had fallen forward over his
  eyes. The two girls entered the room, when they could not arouse him by
  calling him from the outside. The two bottles and the glass upon the table
  told their own story. What they could not tell Shannon guessed&mdash;he had
  overheard the conversation between Wilson Crumb and herself.</p>

  <p>Eva removed the bottles and the glass to the closet,</p>

  <p>"Poor Cus!" she said. "I never saw him like this before.. I wonder what
  could have happened! What had we better do?"</p>

  <p>"Pull down the shades by his bed," said Shannon, and this she did herself
  without waiting for Eva. "No one can see him from the patio now. It will be
  just as well to leave him alone, I think, Eva. He will probably be all right
  when he wakes up."</p>

  <p>They went out of the room, closing the door after them, and a little later
  Shannon mounted the Senator and rode away toward home.</p>

  <p>Her thoughts were bitter. Wherever Crumb went he brought misery. Whatever
  he touched he defiled. She wished that he was dead. God, how she wished it!
  She could have killed him with her own hands for the grief that he had
  brought to Custer Pennington.</p>

  <p>She did not care so much about herself. She was used to suffering because
  of Wilson Crumb; but that he should bring his foulness into the purity of
  Ganado was unthinkable. Her brief happiness was over. No indeed was there
  nothing more in life for her. She was not easily moved to tears, but that
  night she was still sobbing when she fell asleep.</p>

  <p>When the colonel and Mrs. Pennington arrived at the ranch house, just
  before dinner, Eva told them that Custer was not feeling well, and that he
  had lain down to sleep and had asked not to be disturbed. They did not go to
  his room at all, and at about half past eight they retired for the night.</p>

  <p>Eva was very much excited. She had never before experienced the thrill of
  such an adventure as she was about to embark upon. As the time approached,
  she became more and more perturbed. The realization grew upon her that what
  she was doing might seem highly objectionable to her family; but as her
  innocent heart held no suggestion of evil, she considered that her only wrong
  was the infraction of those unwritten laws of well regulated homes which
  forbid their daughters going out alone at night. She would tell about it in
  the morning, and wheedle her father into forgiveness.</p>

  <p>Quickly she changed into riding clothes. Leaving her room, she noiselessly
  passed through the living room and the east wing to the kitchen, and from
  there to the basement, from which a tunnel led beneath the driveway and
  opened on the hillside above the upper pool of the water gardens. To get her
  horse and saddle him required but a few moments, for the moon was full and
  the night almost like day.</p>

  <p>Her heart was beating with excitement as she rode up the cañon toward the
  big sycamore that stood at the junction of Sycamore Cañon and El Camino
  Largo, where Crumb had told her the night scenes would be taken. She walked
  her horse past the bunk house, lest some of the men might hear her; but when
  she was through the east gate, beyond the old goat corral, she broke into a
  canter.</p>

  <p>As she passed the mouth of Jackknife she glanced up the cañon toward the
  site of the K.K.S. camp, but she could not see any lights, as the camp was
  fairly well hidden from the main cañon by trees. As she approached El Camino
  Largo, she saw that all was darkness. There was no sign of the artificial
  lights she imagined they would use for shooting night scenes, nor was there
  anything to indicate the presence of the actors.</p>

  <p>She continued on, however, until presently she saw the outlines of a car
  beneath the big sycamore. A man stepped out and hailed her.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Miss Pennington?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "Aren't you going to take the pictures to-night?"</p>

  <p>She rode up quite close to him. It was Crumb.</p>

  <p>"I am just waiting for the others. Won't you dismount?"</p>

  <p>As she swung from the saddle, he led her horse to his car and tied him to
  the spare tire in the rear; then he returned to the girl. As they talked, he
  adroitly turned the subject of their conversation toward the possibilities
  for fame and fortune which lay in pictures for a beautiful and talented
  girl.</p>

  <p>Long practice had made Wilson Crumb an adept in his evil arts. Ordinarily
  he worked very slowly, considering that weeks, or even months, were not ill
  spent if they led toward the consummation of his desires; but in this
  instance he realized that he must work quickly. He must take the girl by
  storm or not at all.</p>

  <p>So unsophisticated was Eva, and so innocent, that she did not realize from
  his conversation what would have been palpable to one more worldly wise; and
  because she did not repulse him, Crumb thought that she was not averse to his
  advances. It was not until he seized her and tried to kiss her that she awoke
  to a realization of her danger, and of the position in which her silly
  credulity had placed her.</p>

  <p>She carried a quirt in her hand, and she was a Pennington. What matter
  that she was but a slender girl? The honor and the courage of a Pennington
  were hers.</p>

  <p>"How dare you?" she cried, attempting to jerk away.</p>

  <p>When he would have persisted, she raised the heavy quirt and struck him
  across the face.</p>

  <p>"My father shall hear of this, and so shall the man I am to
  marry&mdash;Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>"Go slow!" he growled angrily. "Be careful what you tell! Remember that
  you came up here alone at night to meet a man you have known only a day. How
  will you square that with your assertions of virtue, eh? And as for
  Evans&mdash;yes, one of your men told me to-day that you and he were going to
  be married&mdash;as for him, the less you drag him into this the better it'll
  be for Evans, and you, too!"</p>

  <p>She was walking toward her horse. She wheeled suddenly toward him.</p>

  <p>"Had I been armed, I would have killed you," she said. "Any Pennington
  would kill you for what you attempted. My father or my brother will kill you
  if you are here tomorrow, for I shall tell them what you have done. You had
  better leave to-night. I am advising you for their sakes&mdash;not for
  yours."</p>

  <p>He followed her then, and, when she mounted, he seized her reins.</p>

  <p>"Not so damned fast, young lady! I've got something to say about this.
  You'll keep your mouth shut, or I'll send Evans to the pen, where he
  belongs!"</p>

  <p>"Get out my way!" she commanded, and put her spurs to her mount.</p>

  <p>The horse leaped forward, but Crumb clung to the reins, checking him. Then
  she struck Crumb again; but he managed to seize the quirt and hold it.</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me," he said. "If you tell what happened here to-night,
  I'll tell what I know about Evans, and he'll go to the pen as sure as you're
  a silly little fool!"</p>

  <p>"You know nothing about Mr. Evans. You don't even know him."</p>

  <p>"Listen&mdash;I'll tell you what I know. I know that Evans let your
  brother, who was innocent, go to the pen for the thing that Evans was guilty
  of."</p>

  <p>The girl shrank back.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't lie, either. I'm telling you the truth, and I can bring
  plenty of witnesses to prove what I say. It was young Evans who handled all
  that stolen booze and sold it to some guy from L. A. It was young Evans who
  got the money. He was getting rich on it till your brother butted in and
  crabbed his game, and then it was young Evans who kept still and let an
  innocent man do time for him. That's the kind of fellow you're going to
  marry. If you want the whole world to know about it, you just tell your
  father or your brother anything about me!"</p>

  <p>He saw the girl sink down in her saddle, her head and shoulders drooping
  like some lovely flower in the path of fire, and he knew that he had won.
  Then he let her go.</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was half past nine o'clock when Colonel Pennington was
  aroused by some one knocking on the north door of his bedroom&mdash;the door
  that opened upon the north porch.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was the stableman.</p>

  <p>"Miss Eva's horse is out, sir," the man said. "I heard a horse pass the
  bunk house about half an hour ago. I dressed and come up here to the stables,
  to see if it was one of ours&mdash;somethin' seemed to tell me it
  was&mdash;an' I found her horse out. I thought I'd better tell you about it,
  sir. You can't tell, sir, with all them pictur' people up the cañon, what
  might be goin' on. We'll be lucky if we have any horses or tack left if
  they're here long!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Eva's in bed," said the colonel; "but we'll have to look into this
  at once. Custer's sick to-night, so he can't go along with us; but if you
  will saddle up my horse, and one for yourself, I'll dress and be right down.
  It can't be the motion-picture people&mdash;they're not horse thieves."</p>

  <p>While the stableman returned to saddle the horses, the colonel dressed. So
  sure was he that Eva was in bed that he did not even stop to look into her
  room. As he left the house, he was buckling on a gun&mdash;a thing that he
  seldom carried, for even in the peaceful days that have settled upon southern
  California a horse thief is still a horse thief.</p>

  <p>As he was descending the steps to the stable, he saw some one coming up.
  In the moonlight there was no difficulty in recognizing the figure of his
  daughter.</p>

  <p>"Eva!" he exclaimed. "Where have you been? What are you doing out at this
  time of night, alone?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer, but threw herself into his arms, sobbing.</p>

  <p>"What is it? What has happened, child? Tell me!"</p>

  <p>Her sobs choked her, and she could not speak. Putting his arm about her,
  her father led her up the steps and to her room. There he sat down and held
  her, and tried to comfort her, while he endeavored to extract a coherent
  statement from her. Little by little, word by word, she managed at last to
  tell him.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't cry, dear," he said. "You did a foolish thing to go up there
  alone, but you did nothing wrong. As for what that fellow told you about Guy,
  I don't believe it."</p>

  <p>"But it's the truth," she sobbed. "I know it is the truth now. Little
  things that I didn't think of before come back to me, and in the light of
  what that terrible man told me I know that it's true. We always knew that
  Custer was innocent. Think what a change came over Guy from the moment that
  Custer was arrested. He has been a different man since. And the
  money&mdash;the money that we were to be married on! I never stopped to try
  to reason it out. He had thousands of dollars. He told me not to tell anybody
  how much he had; and that was where it came from. It couldn't have come from
  anything else. Oh, popsy, it is awful, and I loved him so! To think that he,
  that Guy Evans, of all men, would have let my brother go to jail for
  something he did!"</p>

  <p>Again her sobs stifled her.</p>

  <p>"Crying will do no good," the colonel said. "Go to bed now, and to-morrow
  we will talk it over. Good night, little girl. Remember, we'll all stick to
  Guy, no matter what he has done."</p>

  <p>He kissed her then and left her, but he did not return to his room.
  Instead, he went down to the stables and saddled his horse, for the
  stableman, when Eva came in with the missing animal, had put it in its box
  and returned to the bunk house.</p>

  <p>The colonel rode immediately to the sleeping camp in Jackknife Cañon. His
  calls went unanswered for a time, but presently a sleepy man stuck his head
  through the flap of a tent.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for Mr. Crumb. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He went away in his car early in the evening, and hasn't
  come back. What's the matter, anyway? You're the second fellow that's been
  looking for him. Oh, you're Colonel Pennington, aren't you? I didn't
  recognize you. Why, some one was here a little while ago looking for
  him&mdash;a young fellow on horseback. I think it must have been your son.
  Anything I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the colonel. "In case I don't see Mr. Crumb, you can tell him,
  or whoever is in charge, that you're to break camp in the morning and be off
  my property by ten o'clock!"</p>

  <p>He wheeled his horse and rode down Jackknife Cañon toward Sycamore.</p>

  <p>"Well, what the hell!" ejaculated the sleepy man to himself, and withdrew
  again into his tent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SHANNON BURKE, after a restless night, rose early in the
  morning to ride. She always found that the quiet and peace of the hills acted
  as a tonic on jangling nerves, and dispelled, at least for the moment, any
  cloud of unhappiness that might he hovering over her.</p>

  <p>The first person to see her that morning was the flunky from the K.K.S.
  camp who was rustling wood for the cook's morning fire. So interested was he
  in her rather remarkable occupation that he stood watching her from behind a
  bush until she was out of sight. As long as he saw her, she rode slowly,
  dragging at her side a leafy bough, which she moved to and fro, as if
  sweeping the ground. She constantly looked back, as if to note the effect of
  her work; and once or twice he saw her go over short stretches of the road a
  second time, brushing vigorously.</p>

  <p>It was quite light by that time, as it was almost five o'clock, and the
  sun was just rising as she dismounted at the Ganado stables and hurried up
  the steps toward the house. The iron gate at the patio entrance had not yet
  been raised, so she went around to the north side of the house and knocked on
  the colonel's bedroom door.</p>

  <p>He came from his dressing room to answer her knock, for he was fully
  dressed and evidently on the point of leaving for his morning ride. The
  expression of her face denoted that something was wrong, even before she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Colonel," she cried, "Wilson Crumb has been killed. I rode early this
  morning, and as I came into Sycamore over El Camino Largo I saw his body
  lying under the big tree there."</p>

  <p>They were both thinking the same thought, which neither dared
  voice&mdash;where was Custer?</p>

  <p>"Did you notify the camp?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I came directly here."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that it is Crumb, and that he is dead?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am sure that it is Crumb. He was lying on his back, and though I didn't
  dismount I am quite positive that he was dead."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pennington had joined them, herself dressed for riding.</p>

  <p>"How terrible!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Terrible nothing," exclaimed the colonel. "I'm damned glad he's
  dead!"</p>

  <p>Shannon looked at him in astonishment, but Mrs. Pennington understood, for
  the colonel had told her all that Eva had told him.</p>

  <p>"He was a bad man," said Shannon. "The world will be better off without
  him."</p>

  <p>"You knew him?" Colonel Pennington asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I knew him in Hollywood," she replied.</p>

  <p>She knew now that they must all know sooner or later, for she could not
  see how she could be kept out of the investigation and the trial that must
  follow. In her heart she feared that Custer had killed Crumb. The fact that
  he had drunk so heavily that afternoon indicated not only that he had
  overheard, but that what he had heard had affected him
  profoundly&mdash;profoundly enough to have suggested the killing of the man
  whom he believed to have wronged the woman he loved.</p>

  <p>"The first thing to do, I suppose," said the colonel, "is to notify the
  sheriff."</p>

  <p>He left the room and went to the telephone. While he was away Mrs.
  Pennington and Shannon discussed the tragedy, and the older woman confided to
  the other the experience that Eva had had with Crumb the previous night.</p>

  <p>"The beast!" muttered Shannon. "Death was too good for him!"</p>

  <p>Presently the colonel returned to them.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go and see if the children are going to ride with us," he
  said. "There is no reason why we shouldn't ride as usual."</p>

  <p>He went to Eva's door and looked in. Apparently she was still fast asleep.
  Her hair was down, and her curls lay in soft confusion upon her pillow. Very
  gently he closed the door again, glad that she could sleep.</p>

  <p>When he entered his son's room he found Custer lying fully clothed upon
  his bed, his belt about his waist and his gun at his hip. His suspicions were
  crystallized into belief.</p>

  <p>But why had Custer killed Crumb? He couldn't have known of the man's
  affront to Eva, for she had seen no member of the family but her father, and
  in him alone had she confided.</p>

  <p>He crossed to the bed and shook Custer by the shoulder. The younger man
  opened his eyes and sat up on the edge of his bed. He looked first at his
  father and then at himself&mdash; at his boots and spurs, and breeches, and
  the gun about his waist.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Five o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I must have fallen asleep. I wish it was dinner time! I'm hungry."</p>

  <p>"Dinner time! It's only a matter of a couple of hours to breakfast. It's
  five o'clock in the morning."</p>

  <p>Custer rose to his feet in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I must have loaded on more than I knew," he said with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked his father.</p>

  <p>"I had a blue streak yesterday afternoon, and I took a few drinks; and
  here I have slept all the way through to the next morning!"</p>

  <p>"You haven't been out of the room since yesterday afternoon?" asked the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. I thought it was still yesterday afternoon until you
  told me that it is the next morning," said Custer.</p>

  <p>The colonel ran his fingers through his hair.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said.</p>

  <p>Custer didn't know why his father was glad.</p>

  <p>"Riding?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll be with you in a jiffy. I want to wash up a bit."</p>

  <p>He met them at the stables a few minutes later. The effect of the liquor
  had entirely disappeared. He seemed his normal self again, and not at all
  like a man who had the blood of a new murder on his soul. He was glad to see
  Shannon, and squeezed her hand as he passed her horse to get his own.</p>

  <p>In the few moments since his father had awakened him, he had reviewed the
  happenings of the previous day, and his loyalty to the girl he loved had
  determined him that he had nothing to grieve about. Whatever had been between
  her and Crumb she would explain. Only the fact that Eva had interrupted her
  had kept him from knowing the whole truth the previous day.</p>

  <p>They were mounted, and had started out, when the colonel reined to
  Custer's side.</p>

  <p>"Shannon just made a gruesome find up in Sycamore," he said, and
  paused.</p>

  <p>If he had intended to surprise Custer into any indication of guilty
  knowledge, he failed.</p>

  <p>"Gruesome find!" repeated the younger man. "What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Wilson Crumb has been murdered. Shannon found his body."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" ejaculated Custer. "Who do you suppose could have done
  it?"</p>

  <p>Then, quite suddenly, his heart came to his mouth, as he realized that
  there was only one present there who had cause to kill Wilson Crumb. He did
  not dare to look at Shannon for a long time.</p>

  <p>They had gone only a hundred yards when Custer pulled up the Apache and
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," he said, looking at the horse's off forefoot. "He's pulled
  that shoe again. He must have done it in the corral, for it was on when I put
  him in last night. You folks go ahead. I'll go back and saddle Baldy."</p>

  <p>The stableman was still there, and helped him.</p>

  <p>"That was a new shoe," Custer said. "Look about the corral and the box,
  and see if you can find it. You can tack it back on."</p>

  <p>Then he swung to Baldy's back and cantered off after the others.</p>

  <p>A deputy sheriff came from the village of Ganado before they returned from
  their ride, and went up the cañon to take charge of Crumb's body and
  investigate the scene of the crime.</p>

  <p>Eva was still in bed when they were called to breakfast. They insisted
  upon Shannon's remaining, and the four were passing along the arcade past
  Eva's room.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go in and waken her," said Mrs. Pennington. "She doesn't
  like to sleep so late."</p>

  <p>The others passed into the living room, and were walking toward the dining
  room when they were startled by a scream.</p>

  <p>"Custer! Custer!" Mrs. Pennington called to her husband.</p>

  <p>All three turned and hastened back to Eva's room, where they found Mrs.
  Pennington half lying across the bed, her body convulsed with sobs. The
  colonel was the first to reach her, followed by Custer and Shannon. The
  bedclothes lay half thrown back, where Mrs. Pennington had turned them. The
  white sheet was stained with blood, and in Eva's hand was clutched a revolver
  that Custer had given her the previous Christmas.</p>

  <p>"My little girl, my little girl!" cried the weeping mother. "Why did you
  do it?"</p>

  <p>The colonel knelt and put his arms about his wife.</p>

  <p>He could not speak. Custer Pennington stood like a man turned to stone.
  The shock seemed to have bereft him of the power to understand what had
  happened. Finally he turned dumbly toward Shannon. The tears were running
  down her cheeks. Gently she touched his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"My poor boy!" she said.</p>

  <p>The words broke the spell that had held him. He walked to the opposite
  side of the bed and bent close to the still, white face of the sister he had
  worshiped.</p>

  <p>"Dear little sister, how could you, when we love you so?" he said.</p>

  <p>Gently the colonel drew his wife away, and, kneeling, placed his ear close
  above Eva's heart. There were no outward indications of life, but presently
  he lifted his head, an expression of hope relieving that of grim despair
  which had settled upon his countenance at the first realization of the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>"She is not dead," he said. "Get Baldwin! Get him at once!" He was
  addressing Custer. "Then telephone Carruthers, in Los Angeles, to get down
  here as soon as God will let him."</p>

  <p>Custer hurried from the room to carry out his father's
  instructions.</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was later, while they were waiting for the arrival of the
  doctor, that the colonel told Custer of Eva's experience with Crumb the
  previous night.</p>

  <p>"She wanted to kill herself because of what he told her about Guy," he
  said. "There was no other reason."</p>

  <p>Then the doctor came, and they all stood in tense expectancy and mingled
  dread and hope while he made his examination. Carefully and deliberately the
  old doctor worked, outwardly as calm and unaffected as if he were treating a
  minor injury to a stranger; yet his heart was as heavy as theirs, for he had
  brought Eva into the world, and had known and loved her all her brief
  life.</p>

  <p>At last he straightened up, to find their questioning eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>"She still lives," he said, but there was no hope in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for Carruthers," said the colonel. "He is on his way now. He
  told Custer that he'll be here in less than three hours."</p>

  <p>"I arranged to have a couple of nurses sent out, too," said Custer.</p>

  <p>Dr. Baldwin made no reply.</p>

  <p>"There is no hope?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"There is always hope while there is life," replied the doctor; "but you
  must not raise yours too high."</p>

  <p>They understood him, and realized that there was very little hope.</p>

  <p>"Can you keep her alive until Carruthers arrives?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I need not tell you that I shall do my best," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Guy had come, with his mother. He seemed absolutely stunned by the
  catastrophe that had overwhelmed him. There was a wildness in his demeanor
  that frightened them all. It was necessary to watch him carefully, for fear
  that he might attempt to destroy himself when he realized at last that Eva
  was likely to die.</p>

  <p>He insisted that they should tell him all the circumstances that had led
  up to the pitiful tragedy. For a time they sought to conceal a part of the
  truth from him; but at last, so great was his insistence, they were compelled
  to reveal all that they knew.</p>

  <p>Of a nervous and excitable temperament, and endowed by nature with a
  character of extreme sensitiveness and comparatively little strength, the
  shock of the knowledge that it was his own acts that had led Eva to self-
  destruction proved too much for Guy's overwrought nerves and brain. So
  violent did he become that Colonel Pennington and Custer together could
  scarce restrain him, and it became necessary to send for two of the ranch
  employees.</p>

  <p>When the deputy sheriff came to question them about the murder of Crumb,
  it was evident that Guy's mind was so greatly affected that he did not
  understand what was taking place around him. He had sunk into a morose
  silence broken at intervals by fits of raving. Later in the day, at Dr.
  Baldwin's suggestion, he was removed to a sanatorium outside of Los
  Angeles.</p>

  <p>Guy's mental collapse, and the necessity for constantly restraining him,
  had resulted in taking Custer's mind from his own grief, at least for the
  moment; but when he was not thus occupied he sat staring straight ahead of
  him in dumb despair.</p>

  <p>It was eleven o'clock when the best surgeon that Los Angeles could furnish
  arrived, bringing a nurse with him, and Eva was still breathing when he came.
  Dr. Baldwin was there, and together the three worked for an hour while the
  Penningtons and Shannon waited almost hopelessly in the living room, Mrs.
  Evans having accompanied Guy to Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>Finally, after what seemed years, the door of the living room opened, and
  Dr. Carruthers entered. They scanned his face as he entered, but saw nothing
  there to lighten the burden of their apprehension. The colonel and Custer
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked the former, his voice scarcely audible.</p>

  <p>"The operation was successful. I found the bullet and removed it."</p>

  <p>"She will live, then!" cried Mrs. Pennington, coming quickly toward
  him.</p>

  <p>He took her hands very gently in his.</p>

  <p>"My dear madam," he said, "it would be cruel of me to hold out useless
  hope. She hasn't more than one chance in a hundred. It is a miracle that she
  was alive when you found her. Only a splendid constitution, resulting from
  the life that she has led, could possibly account for it."</p>

  <p>The mother turned away with a low moan.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more that you can do?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I have done all that I can," replied Carruthers.</p>

  <p>"She will not last long?"</p>

  <p>"It may be a matter of hours, or only minutes," he replied. "She is in
  excellent hands, however. No one could do more for her than Dr. Baldwin."</p>

  <p>The two nurses whom Custer had arranged for had arrived, and when Dr.
  Carruthers departed he took his own nurse with him.</p>

  <p>It was afternoon when deputies from the sheriff's and coroner's offices
  arrived from Los Angeles, together with detectives from the district
  attorney's office. Crumb's body still lay where it had fallen, guarded by a
  constable from the village of Ganado. It was surrounded by members of his
  company, villagers, and near-by ranchers, for word of the murder had spread
  rapidly in the district in that seemingly mysterious way in which news
  travels in rural communities. Among the crowd was Slick Allen, who had
  returned to the valley after his release from the county jail.</p>

  <p>A partially successful effort had been made to keep the crowd from
  trampling the ground in the immediate vicinity of the body, but beyond a
  limited area whatever possible clues the murderer might have left in the
  shape of footprints had been entirely obliterated long before the officers
  arrived from Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>When the body was finally lifted from its resting place, and placed in the
  ambulance that had been brought from Los Angeles, one of the detectives
  picked up a horseshoe that had lain underneath the body. From its appearance
  it was evident that it had been upon a horse's hoof very recently, and had
  been torn off by force.</p>

  <p>As the detective examined the shoe, several of the crowd pressed forward
  to look at it. Among them was Allen.</p>

  <p>"That's off of young Pennington's horse," he said. "How do you know that?"
  inquired the detective. "I used to work for them&mdash;took care of their
  saddle horses. This young Pennington's horse forges. They had to shoe him
  special, to keep him from pulling the off fore shoe. I could tell one of his
  shoes in a million. If they haven't walked all over his tracks, I can tell
  whether that horse had been up here or not."</p>

  <p>He stooped and examined the ground close to where the body had lain.</p>

  <p>"There!" he said, pointing. "There's an imprint of one of his hind feet.
  See how the toe of that shoe is squared off? That was made by the Apache, all
  right!"</p>

  <p>The detective was interested. He studied the hoof-print carefully, and
  searched for others, but this was the only one he could find.</p>

  <p>"Looks like some one had been sweeping this place with a broom," he
  remarked. "There ain't much of anything shows."</p>

  <p>A pimply-faced young man spoke up.</p>

  <p>"There was some one sweeping the ground this morning," he said. "About
  five o'clock this morning I seen a girl dragging the branch of a tree after
  her, and sweeping along the road below here."</p>

  <p>"Did you know her?" asked the detective.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I never seen her before."</p>

  <p>"Would you know her if you saw her again?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I'd know her! She was a pippin. I'd know her horse, too."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVA was still breathing faintly as the sun dropped behind
  the western hills. Shannon had not left the house all day. She felt that
  Custer needed her, that they all needed her, however little she could do to
  mitigate their grief. There was at least a sense of sharing their burden, and
  her fine sensibilities told her that this service of love was quite as
  essential as the more practical help that she would have been glad to offer
  had it been within her power.</p>

  <p>She was standing in the patio with Custer, at sunset, within call of Eva's
  room, as they had all been during the entire day, when a car drove up along
  the south drive and stopped at the patio entrance. Three of the four men in
  it alighted and advanced toward them.</p>

  <p>"You are Custer Pennington?" one of them asked.</p>

  <p>Pennington nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you are Miss Burke&mdash;Miss Shannon Burke?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"I am a deputy sheriff. I have a warrant here for your arrest."</p>

  <p>"Arrest!" exclaimed Custer. "For what?"</p>

  <p>He read the warrant to them. It charged them with the murder of Wilson
  Crumb.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Mr. Pennington," said the deputy sheriff; "but I have been
  given these warrants, and there is nothing for me to do but serve them."</p>

  <p>"You have to take us away now? Can't you wait&mdash;until&mdash;my sister
  is dying in there. Couldn't it be arranged so that I could stay here under
  arrest as long as she lives?"</p>

  <p>The deputy shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It would be all right with me," he said; "but I have no authority to let
  you stay. Ill telephone in, though, and see what I can do. Where is the
  telephone?"</p>

  <p>Pennington told him.</p>

  <p>"You two stay here with my men," said the deputy sheriff, "while I
  telephone."</p>

  <p>He was gone about fifteen minutes. When he returned, he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing," he said. "I have to bring you both in right away."</p>

  <p>"May I go to her room and see her again before I leave? asked Custer.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the deputy; but when Custer turned toward his sister's room,
  the officer accompanied him.</p>

  <p>Dr. Baldwin and one of the nurses were in the room. Young Pennington came
  and stood beside the bed, looking down on the white face and the tumbled
  curls upon the pillow. He could not perceive the slightest indication of
  life, yet they told him that Eva still lived. He knelt and kissed her, and
  then turned away. He tried to say good-by to her, but his voice broke, and he
  turned and left the room hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Colonel and Mrs. Pennington were in the patio, with Shannon and the
  officers. The colonel and his wife had just learned of this new blow, and
  both of them were stunned. The colonel seemed to have aged a generation in
  that single day. He was a tired, hopeless old man. The heart of his boy and
  that of Shannon Burke went out to him and to the suffering mother from whom
  their son was to be taken at this moment in their lives when they needed him
  most. In their compassion for the older Penningtons they almost forgot the
  seriousness of their own situation.</p><br>

  <p class="first">At their arraignment, next morning, the preliminary hearing
  was set for the following Friday. Early in the morning Custer had received
  word from Ganado that Eva still lived, and that Dr. Baldwin now believed they
  might hold some slight hope for her recovery.</p>

  <p>At Ganado, despair and anxiety had told heavily upon the Penningtons. The
  colonel felt that he should be in Los Angeles, to assist in the defense of
  his son; and yet he knew that his place was with his wife, whose need of him
  was even greater. Nor would his heart permit him to leave the daughter whom
  he worshiped, so long as even a faint spark of life remained in that beloved
  frame.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Evans returned from Los Angeles the following day. She was almost
  prostrated by this last of a series of tragedies ordered, as it seemed, by
  some malignant fate for the wrecking of her happiness. She told them that Guy
  appeared to be hopelessly insane. He did not know his mother, nor did he give
  the slightest indication of any recollection of his past life, or of the
  events that had overthrown his reason.</p>

  <p>At ten o'clock on Wednesday night Dr. Baldwin came into the living room,
  where the colonel and his wife were sitting with Mrs. Evans. For two days
  none of them had been in bed. They were tired and haggard, but not more so
  than the old doctor, who had remained constantly on duty from the moment when
  he was summoned. Never had man worked with more indefatigable zeal than he to
  wrest a young life from the path of the grim reaper. There were deep lines
  beneath his eyes, and his face was pale and drawn, as he entered the room and
  stood before them; but for the first time in many hours there was a smile
  upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said, "that we are going to save her."</p>

  <p>The others were too much affected to speak. So long had hope been denied
  that now they dared not even think of hope.</p>

  <p>"She regained consciousness a few moments ago. She looked up at me and
  smiled, and then she fell asleep. She is breathing quite naturally now. She
  must not be disturbed, though. I think it would be well if you all retired.
  Mrs. Pennington, you certainly must get some sleep&mdash;and you too, Mrs.
  Evans, or I cannot be responsible for the results. I have left word with the
  night nurse to call me immediately, if necessary, and if you will all go to
  your rooms I will lie on the sofa here in the living room. I feel at last
  that it will be safe for me to leave her in the hands of the nurse, and a
  little sleep won't hurt me."</p>

  <p>The colonel took his old friend by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Baldwin," he said, "it is useless to try to thank you. I couldn't, even
  if there were the words to do it with."</p>

  <p>"You don't have to, Pennington. I think I love her as much as you do.
  There isn't any one who knows her who doesn't love her, and who wouldn't have
  done as much as I. Now, get off to bed all of you, and I think we'll find
  something to be very happy about by morning. If there is any change for the
  worse, I will let you know immediately."</p><br>

  <p class="first">In the county jail in Los Angeles, Custer Pennington and
  Shannon Burke, awaiting trial on charges of a capital crime, were filled with
  increasing happiness as the daily reports from Ganado brought word of Eva's
  steady improvement, until at last that she was entirely out of danger.</p>

  <p>The tedious preliminaries of selecting a jury were finally concluded. As
  witness after witness was called, Pennington came to realize for the first
  time what a web of circumstantial evidence the State had fabricated about
  him. Even from servants whom he knew to be loyal and friendly the most
  damaging evidence was elicited. His mother's second maid testified that she
  had seen him fully dressed in his room late in the evening before the murder,
  when she had come in, as was her custom, with a pitcher of iced water, not
  knowing that the young man was there. She had seen him lying upon the bed,
  with his gun in its holster hanging from the belt about his waist. She also
  testified that the following morning, when she had come into make up his bed,
  she had discovered that it had not been slept in.</p>

  <p>The stableman testified that the Apache had been out on the night of the
  murder. He had rubbed the animal off earlier in the evening, when the
  defendant had come in from riding. At that time the two had examined the
  horse's shoes, the animal having just been re-shod. He said that on the
  morning after the murder there were saddle sweat marks on the Apache's back,
  and that the off fore shoe was missing.</p>

  <p>One of the K.K.S. employees testified that a young man, whom he partially
  identified as Custer, had ridden into their camp about nine o'clock on the
  night of the murder, and had inquired concerning the whereabouts of Crumb. He
  said that the young man seemed excited, and upon being told that Crumb was
  away he had ridden off rapidly toward Sycamore Cañon.</p>

  <p>Added to all this were the damaging evidence of the detective who had
  found the Apache's off fore shoe under Crumb's body, and the positive
  identification of the shoe by Allen. The one thing that was lacking&mdash;a
  motive for the crime&mdash;was supplied by Allen and the Penningtons' house
  man.</p>

  <p>The latter testified that among his other duties was the care of the hot
  water heater in the basement of the Pennington home. Upon the evening of
  Saturday, August 5, he had forgotten to shut off the burner, as was his
  custom. He had returned about nine o'clock, to do so. When he had left the
  house by the passageway leading from the basement beneath the south drive and
  opening on the hillside just above the water gardens, he had seen a man
  standing by the upper pool, with his arms about a woman, whom he was kissing.
  It was a bright moonlight night, and the house man had recognized the two as
  Custer Pennington and Miss Burke. Being embarrassed by having thus
  accidentally come upon them, he had moved away quietly in the opposite
  direction, among the shadows of the trees, and had returned to the bunk
  house.</p>

  <p>The connecting link between this evidence and the motive for the crime was
  elicited from Allen in half an hour of direct examination, which constituted
  the most harrowing ordeal that Shannon Burke had ever endured; for it laid
  bare before the world, and before the man she loved, the sordid history of
  her life with Wilson Crumb. It portrayed her as a drug addict and a wanton;
  but, more terrible still, it established a motive for the murder of Crumb by
  Custer Pennington.</p>

  <p>Owing to the fact that he had lain in a drunken stupor during the night of
  the crime, that no one had seen him from the time when the maid entered his
  room to bring his iced water until his father had found him fully clothed
  upon his bed at five o'clock the following morning, young Pennington was
  unable to account for his actions, or to state his whereabouts at the time
  when the murder was committed.</p>

  <p>He realized what the effect of the evidence must be upon the minds of the
  jurors when he himself was unable to assert positively, even to himself, that
  he had not left his room that night. Nor was he very anxious to refute the
  charge against him, since in his heart he believed that Shannon Burke had
  killed Crumb. He did not even take the stand in his own defense.</p>

  <p>The evidence against Shannon was less convincing. A motive had been
  established in Crumb's knowledge of her past life and the malign influence
  that he had had upon it. The testimony of the camp flunky who had seen her
  obliterating what evidence the trail might have given in the form of
  hoof-prints constituted practically the only direct evidence that was brought
  against her. It seemed to Custer that the gravest charge that could justly be
  brought against her was that of accessory after the fact, provided the jury
  was convinced of his guilt.</p>

  <p>Many witnesses testified, giving evidence concerning apparently irrelevant
  subjects. It was brought out, however, that Crumb died from the effects of a
  wound inflicted by a forty-five-caliber pistol, that Custer Pennington
  possessed such a weapon, and that at the time of his arrest it had been found
  in its holster, with its cartridge belt, thrown carelessly upon his bed.</p>

  <p>When Shannon Burke took the stand, all eyes were riveted upon her. They
  were attracted not only by her youth and beauty, but also by the morbid
  interest which the frequenters of court rooms would naturally feel in the
  disclosure of the life she had led at Hollywood. Even to the most
  sophisticated it appeared incredible that this refined girl, whose soft, well
  modulated voice and quiet manner carried a conviction of innate modesty,
  could be the woman whom Slick Allen's testimony had revealed in such a role
  of vice and degradation.</p>

  <p>Allen's eyes were fastened upon her with the same intent and searching
  expression that had marked his attitude upon the occasion of his last visit
  to the Vista del Paso bungalow, as if he were trying to recall the identity
  of some half forgotten face.</p>

  <p>Though Shannon gave her evidence in a simple, straightforward manner, it
  was manifest that she was undergoing an intense nervous strain. The story
  that she told, coming as it did out of a clear sky, unguessed either by the
  prosecution or by the defense, proved a veritable bombshell to them both. It
  came after it had appeared that the last link had been forged in the chain
  that fixed the guilt upon Custer Pennington. She had asked, then, to be
  permitted to take the stand and tell her story in her own way.</p>

  <p>"I did not see Mr. Crumb," she said, "from the time I left Hollywood on
  the 30th of July, last year, until the afternoon before he was killed; nor
  had I communicated with him during that time. What Mr. Allen told you about
  my having been a drug addict was true, but he did not tell you that Crumb
  made me what I was, or that after I came to Ganado to live I overcame the
  habit. I did not live with Crumb as his wife. He used me to peddle narcotics
  for him. I was afraid of him, and did not want to go back to him. When I
  left, I did not even let him know where I was going.</p>

  <p>"The afternoon before he was killed I met him accidentally in the patio of
  Colonel Pennington's home. The Penningtons had no knowledge of my association
  with Crumb. I knew that they wouldn't have tolerated me, had they known what
  I had been. Crumb demanded that I should return to him, and threatened to
  expose me if I refused. I knew that he was going to be up in the cañon that
  night. I rode up there and shot him. The next morning I went back and
  attempted to obliterate the tracks of my horse, for I had learned from Custer
  Pennington that it is sometimes easy to recognize individual peculiarities in
  the tracks of a shod horse. That is all, except that Mr. Pennington had no
  knowledge of what I did, and no part in it."</p><br>

  <p class="first">Momentarily her statement seemed to overthrow the State's
  case against Pennington; but that the district attorney was not convinced of
  its truth was indicated by his cross- examination of her and other witnesses,
  and later by the calling of new witnesses. They could not shake her
  testimony, but on the other hand she was unable to prove that she had ever
  possessed a forty-five-caliber pistol, or to account for what she had done
  with it after the crime.</p>

  <p>During the course of her cross-examination many apparently unimportant and
  irrelevant facts were adduced, among them the name of the Middle Western town
  in which she had been born. This trivial bit of testimony was the only point
  that seemed to make any impression on Allen. Any one watching him at the
  moment would have seen a sudden expression of incredulity and consternation
  overspread his face, the hard lines of which slowly gave place to what might,
  in another, have suggested a semblance of grief.</p>

  <p>For several minutes he sat staring intently at Shannon. Then he crossed to
  the side of her attorney, and whispered a few words in the lawyer's ear.
  Receiving an assent to whatever his suggestion might have been, he left the
  court room.</p><br>

  <p class="first">On the following day the defense introduced a new witness in
  the person of a Japanese who had been a house servant in the bungalow on the
  Vista del Paso. His testimony substantiated Shannon Burke's statement that
  she and Crumb had not lived together as man and wife.</p>

  <p>Then Allen was recalled to the stand. He told of the last evening that he
  had spent at Crumb's bungalow, and of the fact that Miss Burke, who was then
  known to him as Gaza de Lure, had left the house at the same time he did. He
  testified that Crumb had asked her why she was going home so early; that she
  had replied that she wanted to write a letter; that he, Allen, had remarked
  "I thought you lived here," to which she had replied, "I'm here nearly all
  day, but I go home nights." The witness added that this conversation took
  place in Crumb's presence, and that the director did not in any way deny the
  truth of the girl's assertion.</p>

  <p>Why Allen should have suddenly espoused her cause was a mystery to
  Shannon, only to be accounted for upon the presumption that if he could
  lessen the value of that part of her testimony which had indicated a possible
  motive for the crime, he might thereby strengthen the case against
  Pennington, toward whom he still felt enmity, and whom he had long ago
  threatened to "get."</p>

  <p>The district attorney, in his final argument, drew a convincing picture of
  the crime from the moment when Custer Pennington saddled his horse at the
  stables at Ganado. He followed him up the cañon to the camp in Jackknife,
  where he had inquired concerning Crumb, and then down to Sycamore again,
  where, at the mouth of Jackknife, the lights of Crumb's car would have been
  visible up the larger cañon.</p>

  <p>He demonstrated clearly that a man familiar with the hills, and searching
  for some one whom sentiments of jealousy and revenge were prompting him to
  destroy, would naturally investigate this automobile light that was shining
  where no automobile should be. That the prisoner had ridden out with the
  intention of killing Crumb was apparent from the fact that he had carried a
  pistol in a country where, under ordinary circumstances, there was no
  necessity for carrying a weapon for self-defense. He vividly portrayed the
  very instant of the commission of the crime&mdash;how Pennington leaned from
  his saddle and shot Crumb through the heart; the sudden leap of the murder's
  horse as he was startled by the report of the pistol, or possibly by the
  falling body of the murdered man; and how, in so jumping, he had forged and
  torn off the shoe that had been found beneath Crumb's body.</p>

  <p>"And," he said, "this woman knew that he was going to kill Wilson Crumb.
  She knew it, and she made no effort to prevent it. On the contrary, as soon
  as it was light enough, she rode directly to the spot where Crumb's body lay,
  and, as has been conclusively demonstrated by the unimpeachable testimony of
  an eyewitness, she deliberately sought to expunge all traces of her lover's
  guilt."</p>

  <p>He derided Shannon's confession, which he termed an eleventh hour effort
  to save a guilty man from the gallows.</p>

  <p>"If she killed Wilson Crumb, what did she kill him with?"</p>

  <p>He picked up the bullet that had been extracted from Crumb's body.</p>

  <p>"Where is the pistol from which this bullet came? Here it is,
  gentlemen!"</p>

  <p>He picked up the weapon that had been taken from Custer's room.</p>

  <p>"Compare this bullet with those others that were taken from the clip in
  the handle of this automatic. They are identical. This pistol did not belong
  to Shannon Burke It was never in her possession. No pistol of this character
  was ever in her possession. Had she had one, she could have told where she
  obtained it, and whether it had been sold to her or to another; and the
  records of the seller would show whether or not she spoke the truth. Failing
  to tell us where she procured the weapon, she could at least lead us to the
  spot where she had disposed of it She can do neither, and the reason why she
  cannot is because she never owned a forty-five-caliber pistol. She never had
  one in her possession, and therefore she could not have killed Crumb with
  one."</p>

  <p>When at length the case went to the jury, Custer Pennington's conviction
  seemed a foregone conclusion, while the fate of Shannon Burke was yet in the
  laps of the gods. The testimony that Allen and the Japanese servant had given
  in substantiation of Shannon's own statement that her relations with Wilson
  Crumb had only been those of an accomplice in the disposal of narcotics,
  removed from consideration the principal motive that she might have had for
  killing Crumb.</p>

  <p>And so there was no great surprise when, several hours later, the jury
  returned a verdict in accordance with the public opinion of Los
  Angeles&mdash;where, owing to the fact that murder juries are not isolated,
  such cases are tried largely by the newspapers and the public. They found
  Custer Pennington, Jr., guilty of murder in the first degree, and Shannon
  Burke not guilty.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the day when Custer was to be sentenced, Colonel
  Pennington and Shannon Burke were present in the court room. Mrs. Pennington
  had remained at home with Eva, who was slowly convalescing. Shannon reached
  the court room before the colonel. When he arrived, he sat down beside her,
  and placed his hand on hers.</p>

  <p>"Whatever happens," he said, "we shall still believe in him. No matter
  what the evidence&mdash;and I do not deny that the jury brought in a just
  verdict in accordance with it&mdash;I know that he is innocent. He told me
  yesterday that he was innocent, and my boy would not lie to me. He thought
  that you killed Crumb, Shannon. He overheard the conversation between you and
  Crumb in the patio that day, and he knew that you had good reason to kill the
  man. He knows now, as we all know, that you did not. Probably it must always
  remain a mystery. He would not tell me that he was innocent until after you
  had been proven so. He loves you very much, my girl!"</p>

  <p>"After all that he heard here in court? After what I have been? I thought
  none of you would ever want to see me again."</p>

  <p>The colonel pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"Whatever happens," he said, "you are going back home with me. You tried
  to give your life for my son. If this were not enough, the fact that he loves
  you, and that we love you, is enough."</p>

  <p>Two tears crept down Shannon's cheeks&mdash;the first visible signs of
  emotion that she had manifested during all the long weeks of the ordeal that
  she had been through. Nothing had so deeply affected her as the magnanimity
  of the proud old Pennington, whose pride and honor, while she had always
  admired them, she had regarded as an indication of a certain puritanical
  narrowness that could not forgive the transgression of a woman.</p>

  <p>When the judge announced the sentence, and they realized that Custer
  Pennington was to pay the death penalty, although it had been almost a
  foregone conclusion, the shock left them numb and cold.</p>

  <p>Neither the condemned man nor his father gave any outward indication of
  the effect of the blow. They were Penningtons, and the Pennington pride
  permitted them no show of weakness before the eyes of strangers. Nor yet was
  there any bravado in their demeanor. The younger Pennington did not look at
  his father or Shannon as he was led away toward his cell, between two
  bailiffs.</p>

  <p>As Shannon Burke walked from the court room with the colonel, she could
  think of nothing but the fact that in two months the man she loved was to be
  hanged. She tried to formulate plans for his release&mdash;wild, quixotic
  plans; but she could not concentrate her mind upon anything but the
  bewildering thought that in two months they would hang him by the neck until
  he was dead.</p>

  <p>She knew that he was innocent. Who, then, had committed the crime? Who had
  murdered Wilson Crumb?</p>

  <p>Outside the Hall of Justice she was accosted by Allen, whom she attempted
  to pass without noticing. The colonel turned angrily on the man. He was in
  the mood to commit murder himself; but Allen forestalled any outbreak on the
  old man's part by a pacific gesture of his hands and a quick appeal to
  Shannon.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, please," he said. "I know you think I had a lot to do with
  Pennington's conviction. I want to help you now. I can't tell you why. I
  don't believe he was guilty. I changed my mind recently. If I can see you
  alone, Miss Burke. I can tell you something that might give you a line on the
  guilty party."</p>

  <p>"Under no conceivable circumstances can you see Miss Burke alone," snapped
  the colonel.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to hurt her," said Allen. "Just let her talk to me here
  alone on the sidewalk, where no one can overhear."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl, who could see no opportunity pass which held the
  slightest ray of hope for Custer.</p>

  <p>The colonel walked away, but turned and kept his eyes on the man when he
  was out of earshot. Allen spoke hurriedly to the girl for ten or fifteen
  minutes, and then turned and left her. When she returned to the colonel, the
  latter did not question her. When she did not offer to confide in him, he
  knew that she must have good reasons for her reticence, since he realized
  that her sole interest lay in aiding Custer.</p><br>

  <p class="first">For the next two months the colonel divided his time between
  Ganado and San Francisco, that he might be near San Quentin, where Custer was
  held pending the day of execution. Mrs. Pennington, broken in health by the
  succession of blows that she had sustained, was sorely in need of his
  companionship and help. Eva was rapidly regaining her strength and some
  measure of her spirit. She had begun to realize how useless and foolish her
  attempt at self- destruction had been, and to see that the braver and nobler
  course would have been to give Guy the benefit of her moral support in his
  time of need.</p>

  <p>The colonel, who had wormed from Custer the full story of his conviction
  upon the liquor charge, was able to convince her that Guy had not played a
  dishonorable part, and that of the two he had suffered more than Custer. Her
  father did not condone or excuse Guy's wrongdoing, but he tried to make her
  understand that it was no indication of a criminal inclination, but rather
  the thoughtless act of an undeveloped boy.</p>

  <p>During the two months they saw little or nothing of Shannon. She remained
  in Los Angeles, and when she made the long trip to San Quentin to see Custer,
  or when they chanced to see her, they could not but note how thin and drawn
  she was becoming. The roses had left her cheeks, and there were deep lines
  beneath her eyes, in which there was constantly an expression of haunting
  fear.</p>

  <p>As the day of the execution drew nearer, the gloom that had hovered over
  Ganado for months settled like a dense pall upon them all. On the day before
  the execution the colonel left for San Francisco, to say good-by to his son
  for the last time. Custer had insisted that his mother and Eva must not come,
  and they had acceded to his wish.</p>

  <p>On the afternoon when the colonel arrived at San Quentin, he was permitted
  to see his son for the last time. The two conversed in low tones, Custer
  asking questions about his mother and sister, and about the little everyday
  activities of the ranch. Neither of them referred to the event of the
  following morning.</p>

  <p>"Has Shannon been here to-day?" the colonel asked.</p>

  <p>Custer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen her this week," he said. "I suppose she dreaded coming. I
  don't blame her. I should like to have seen her once more, though!"</p>

  <p>Presently they stood in silence for several moments.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go, dad," said the boy. "Go back to mother and Eva. Don't
  take it too hard. It isn't so bad, after all. I have led a bully life, and I
  have never forgotten once that I am a Pennington. I shall not forget it to-
  morrow."</p>

  <p>The father could not speak. They clasped hands once, the older man turned
  away, and the guards led Custer back to the death cell for the last time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was morning when the colonel reached the ranch. He found
  his wife and Eva sitting in Custer's room. They knew the hour, and they were
  waiting there to be as near him as they could. They were weeping quietly.</p>

  <p>In the kitchen across the patio they could hear Hannah sobbing.</p>

  <p>They sat there for a long time in silence. Suddenly they heard a door slam
  in the patio, and the sound of some one running. "Colonel Pennington! Colonel
  Pennington!" a voice cried.</p>

  <p>The colonel stepped to the door of Custer's room. It was the bookkeeper
  calling him.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked. "Here I am."</p>

  <p>"The Governor has granted a stay of execution. There is new evidence. Miss
  Burke is on her way here now. She has found the man who killed Crumb!"</p>

  <p>What more he said the colonel did not hear, for he had turned back into
  the room, and, collapsing on his son's bed, had broken into tears&mdash;he
  who had gone through those long weeks like a man of iron.</p><br>

  <p class="first">It was nearly noon before Shannon arrived. She had been
  driven from Los Angeles by an attaché of the district attorney's office. The
  Penningtons had been standing on the east porch, watching the road with
  binoculars, so anxious were they for confirmation of their hopes.</p>

  <p>She was out of the car before it had stopped and was running toward them.
  The man who had accompanied her followed, and joined them on the porch.
  Shannon threw her arms around Mrs. Pennington's neck.</p>

  <p>"He is safe!" she cried. "Another has confessed, and has satisfied the
  district attorney of his guilt."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" they asked. Shannon turned toward Eva.</p>

  <p>"It is going to be another blow to you all," she said; "but wait until I'm
  through, and you will understand that it could not have been otherwise. It
  was Guy who killed Wilson Crumb."</p>

  <p>"Guy? Why should he have done it?"</p>

  <p>"That was it. That was why suspicion was never directed toward him. Only
  he knew the facts that prompted him to commit the deed. It was Allen who
  suggested to me the possibility that it might have been Guy. I have spent
  nearly two months at the sanatorium with this gentleman from the district
  attorney's office, in an effort to awaken Guy's sleeping intellect to a
  realization of the past, and of the present necessity for recalling it. He
  has been improving steadily, but it was only yesterday that memory returned
  to him. We worked on the theory that if he could be made to realize that Eva
  lived, the cause of his mental sickness would be removed. We tried
  everything, and we had almost given up hope when, almost like a miracle, his
  memory returned, while he was looking at a kodak picture of Eva that I had
  shown him. The rest was easy, especially after he knew that she had
  recovered. Instead of the necessity for confession resulting in a further
  shock, it seemed to inspirit him. His one thought was of Custer, his one hope
  that we would be in time to save him."</p>

  <p>"Why did he kill Crumb?" asked Eva.</p>

  <p>"Because Crumb killed Grace. He told me the whole story yesterday."</p>

  <p>Very carefully Shannon related all that Guy had told of Crumb's relations
  with his sister, up to the moment of Grace's death.</p>

  <p>"I am glad he killed him!" said Eva. "I would have had no respect for him
  if he hadn't done it."</p>

  <p>"Guy told me that the evening before he killed Crumb he had been looking
  over a motion picture magazine, and he had seen there a picture of Crumb
  which tallied with the photograph he had taken from Grace's dressing
  table&mdash;a portrait of the man who, as she told him, was responsible for
  her trouble. Guy had never been able to learn this man's identity, but the
  picture in the magazine, with his name below it, was a reproduction of the
  same photograph. There was no question as to the man's identity. The
  scarf-pin, and a lock of hair falling in a peculiar way over the forehead,
  marked the pictures as identical. Though Guy had never seen Crumb, he knew
  from conversations that he had heard here that it was Wilson Crumb who was
  directing the picture that was to be taken on Ganado. He immediately got his
  pistol, saddled his horse, and rode up to the camp in search of Crumb. It was
  he whom one of the witnesses mistook for Custer. He then did what the
  district attorney attributed to Custer. He rode to the mouth of Jackknife,
  and saw the lights of Crumb's car up near El Camino Largo. While he was in
  Jackknife, Eva must have ridden down Sycamore from her meeting with Crumb,
  passing Jackknife before Guy rode back into Sycamore. He rode up to where
  Crumb was attempting to crank his engine. Evidently the starter had failed to
  work, for Crumb was standing in front of the car, in the glare of the
  headlights, attempting to crank it. Guy accosted him, charged him with the
  murder of Grace, and shot him. He then started for home by way of El Camino
  Largo. Half a mile up the trail he dismounted and hid his pistol and belt in
  a hollow tree. Then he rode home.</p>

  <p>"He told me that while he never for an instant regretted his act, he did
  not sleep all that night, and was in a highly nervous condition when the
  shock of Eva's supposed death unbalanced his mind; otherwise he would gladly
  have assumed the guilt of Crumb's death at the time when Custer and I were
  accused.</p>

  <p>"After we had obtained Guy's confession, Allen gave us further information
  tending to prove Custer innocent. He said he could not give it before without
  incriminating himself; and as he had no love for Custer, he did not intend to
  hang for a crime he had not committed. He knew that he would surely hang if
  he confessed the part that he had played in formulating the evidence against
  Custer.</p>

  <p>"Crumb had been the means of sending Allen to the county jail, after
  robbing him of several thousand dollars. The day before Crumb was killed,
  Allen's sentence expired. The first thing he did was to search for Crumb,
  with the intention of killing the man. He learned at the studio where Crumb
  was, and he followed him immediately. He was hanging around the camp out of
  sight, waiting for Crumb, when he heard the shot that killed him. His
  investigation led him to Crumb's body. He was instantly overcome by the fear,
  induced by his guilty conscience, that the crime would be laid at his door.
  In casting about for some plan by which he might divert suspicion from
  himself, he discovered an opportunity to turn it against a man whom he hated.
  The fact that he had been a stableman on Ganado, and was familiar with the
  customs of the ranch, made it an easy thing for him to go to the stables,
  saddle the Apache, and ride him up Sycamore to Crumb's body. Here he
  deliberately pulled the off fore shoe from the horse and hid it under Crumb's
  body. Then he rode back to the stable, unsaddled the Apache, and made his way
  to the village.</p>

  <p>"The district attorney said that we need have no fear but that Custer will
  be exonerated and freed. And, Eva"&mdash;she turned to the girl with a happy
  smile&mdash;"I have it very confidentially that there is small likelihood
  that any jury in southern California will convict Guy, if he bases his
  defense upon a plea of insanity."</p>

  <p>Eva smiled bravely and said:</p>

  <p>"One thing I don't understand, Shannon, is what you were doing brushing
  the road with a bough from a tree, on the morning after the killing of Crumb,
  if you weren't trying to obliterate some one's tracks."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I was trying to do," said Shannon, "Ever since Custer
  taught me something about tracking, it has held a certain fascination for me,
  so that I often try to interpret the tracks I see along the trails in the
  hills. It was because of this, I suppose, that I immediately recognized the
  Apache's tracks around the body of Crumb. I immediately jumped to the
  conclusion that Custer had killed him, and I did what I could to remove this
  evidence. As it turned out, my efforts did more harm than good, until Allen's
  explanation cleared up the matter."</p>

  <p>"And why," asked the colonel, "did Allen undergo this sudden change of
  heart?"</p>

  <p>Shannon turned toward him, her face slightly flushed, though she looked
  him straight in the eyes as she spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is a hard thing for me to tell you," she said. "Allen is a bad
  man&mdash;a very bad man; yet in the worst of men there is a spark of good.
  Allen told me this morning, in the district attorney's office, what it was
  that had kindled to life the spark of good in him. He is my father."</p>
