<h2><a name="e01" id="e01">THE STORY BEHIND <i>A LANTERN IN HER
HAND</i></a></h2>
<h2>By Bess Streeter Aldrich</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When the editor of <i>Christian Herald</i> asked me to write
the story behind the story of "A Lantern in Her Hand," it seemed
an easy assignment. Here at my desk several weeks later the task
does not look so simple. For the roots of a writer's work in
creating characters often go deep into the garden soil of his own
life. So the article must contain something of my childhood, for
it was then that I began, all unconsciously, to gather material
for this book.</p>
<p>The child of middle-aged parents, I was the last of a family
of eight, born after they had moved from their Iowa farm into the
college town of Cedar Falls, so I was not a farm child and never
knew at first hand any of the experiences in the story. There was
a great deal of talk and laughter in that childhood home, for
many relatives were always coming and going, uncles and aunts who
had been sturdy pioneers there on the Cedar River when the state
was new.</p>
<p>My grandfather, Zimri Streeter, had arrived in Blackhawk
County with his big family in 1852, when there was no railroad
west of the Mississippi and the crossing of the river was made by
ferry boat. He built a sturdy log cabin, sheltered his neighbors
during an Indian scare or two, and turned the virgin sod. Dipping
into the politics of the new county, he was elected to the first
legislature after the capital was moved from its territorial
status in Iowa City to the little new Des Moines. Because of his
dry wit he was called "the wag of the House," and undoubtedly he
was a reactionary, for there is an old letter still in existence
which says he believes he "did more settin' on unwise measures
than anybody in the House."</p>
<p>A dozen years later, at the time of the second Lincoln
election, he was appointed by Governor Kirkwood to go down into
Georgia and bring back the Iowa soldiers' votes. He was
sixty-four years old then, and when he got back to Atlanta he
found the city burning, all communication to the north severed,
and he had to march along with Sherman to the sea. There is a
story to the effect that in all the hardships he had to undergo,
sometimes foraging for food from the fields, his only complaint
when he got back was that he had lost his hat.</p>
<p>All these tales of hardy old Zimri floated around my childish
ears whenever his rather garrulous clan got together.</p>
<p>Mother's family came to the county two years later than
father's people. At eighteen she drove one of the teams all the
way out from Illinois. Sometimes she would recall the scenes of
that trip: the ferrying across the Mississippi, the horses and
oxen plunging up and down the bridgeless creekbeds, the tipping
over of one of the wagons with the eight precious sacks of flour
slipping into the water and the feather pillows floating down
stream like so many geese, while the younger children chased
after them with hilarious laughter. She would tell the happenings
merrily as though there had been no hardships at all. The camping
on the edge of the woods, the sounds of the night winds, the
odors of the prairie grass--all these she pictured so clearly
that I could almost see and hear and smell them myself.</p>
<p>So the pictures she drew for me verbally became a part of my
knowledge, even though they had happened so many years before I
was born. And with no possible foresight on my part of how they
were to be used one day in stories, they seemed to belong in my
own memories.</p>
<p>Mother was a high-minded woman, a lover of good literature
even though her own schooling had ended in a log schoolhouse. She
was a person who found joy in little things--to whom a cloud
floating across the blue was a poem--to whom the twilight chirp
of robins was a prayer. In those early days of hard work after
starting the new home with my father, she must have been torn
between her love of the finer things of life and the menial tasks
her hands were forced to do. And being so torn, she did what many
another pioneer woman did: she lifted her eyes to the hills while
her hands performed their humble labors.</p>
<p>When she was in her eighties, she once related some pioneer
experiences about the snow sifting through the chinks of the
cabin and making grotesque figures on the bed quilts. In a moment
of sympathy I remarked that we daughters were sorry her life had
been hard in her pioneering days, that it seemed unfair that we
now should live in an easier era with all its modern
conveniences. She looked at me with an odd little expression and
said: "Oh, save your pity. We had the best time in the
world."</p>
<p>I thought of it many times after she was gone--that I would
like to do a story of that type of woman. Other writers had
depicted the Midwest's early days, but so often they had pictured
their women as gaunt, browbeaten creatures, despairing women whom
life seemed to defeat. That was not my mother. Not with her
courage, her humor, her nature that would cause her to say at the
end of a long life: "We had the best time in the world."</p>
<p>So my desire was first, to catch in the pages of a book the
spirit of such a woman, and second, historical accuracy. Almost
before the outline of the book was formulated, I named this main
character Abbie Deal, a name which seemed from the first to fit
her. The fictitious character, Abbie Deal, might have lived
anywhere. She might have traveled into the Mohawk Valley in
another era. She might have gone with her husband into the
wheatlands of Dakota, onto a Montana ranch, into the orchard
country of the Northwest. But the natural choice of settings was
the Iowa and Nebraska backgrounds known to me.</p>
<p>Probably the question most often put to me in the twenty-
three years since Abbie Deal was pictured in "A Lantern In Her
Hand" has been, "Was she your own mother?" The answer is
<i>yes</i> and <i>no.</i> With all the above introduction to my
mother's character, it is easy to see that she was with me in
spirit all of the time I was at work. But in the physical realm,
that pioneering in Nebraska, she was not Abbie Deal. For mother
never came to Nebraska until she was in her seventies, when she
moved here with us to live out her days. And as I never lived in
Nebraska until after my marriage, whatever knowledge I have of
the pioneer days has been obtained from old people who did live
there in an earlier day. Some of them were still living when the
book was written, none of those who helped me are now alive. It
was only the authentic historical material that I lacked for the
story, as those childhood memories of my own hardy forebears gave
the keys to the pioneer character.</p>
<p>Three books of mine had been published previously and I was
under contract to my publishers for another one when I came to
the decision to do that pioneer mother story which had been
dormant in my mind for so long. Because one of the previous
books, "The Rim of the Prairie," had pictured a pioneer couple
among its cast of characters, the editor of the <i>Nebraska State
Journal</i> asked me to give a talk over the radio on "The
Pioneer in Fiction." Twenty-five years ago that was something of
a pioneering event in itself, and I remember how my family all
trailed over to a neighbor doctor's home to hear me, his radio
being the only one in town. At the close of that rather nervous
talk into the unfamiliar mechanism, I asked all those listening
who had any anecdotes concerning the early days here in Nebraska,
and who were interested in having them incorporated into a novel,
to send them to my home. Expecting perhaps a half dozen or so
responses, I was amazed to see the letters, newspaper clippings,
scrapbooks, and diaries which almost swamped me. In addition to
this, there were the interviews with many old people closer at
hand.</p>
<p>For fourteen months I worked among that material sent me and
the notes from the interviews, the actual writing took only five
months. The necessity for the lengthy preparation was the
rambling nature of those letters and interviews, as they jumped
blithely from one subject to another and one year to another
without regard to sequence of events, making one huge jigsaw
puzzle. So it took that long to prepare anecdotes and events in
their correct succession of time. So thorough had been this
sorting into containers for each year of the story that when the
actual writing began I could pick up any chapter and work on it,
be it fourteen, five or eleven. A certain reward for this rather
painstaking process is the fact that the book has been used for
years as supplementary reading in history classes, through an
educational edition with questions at the end of chapters.</p>
<p>"A Lantern in Her Hand" was written to please no one but my
own consciousness of the character of many of those pioneer
mothers. It was written in the so-called "mad twenties" when most
of the best-selling books were about sophistication, flaming
youth, or far-flung countries. There was some youth in it, but
not of the flaming type. There was no sophistication, for Abbie
Deal was of the soil. There was not even diversity of scene, for
Abbie was only a homemaker.</p>
<p>"Lantern" seemed destined to be lost in the wave of the
popular type of the times. That it has made new friends each year
since that day might be a bit of a lesson for young writers.
<i>Regardless of the popular literary trend of the times, write
the thing which lies close to your heart.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="i01" id="i01">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Cedartown sits beside a great highway which was once a buffalo
trail. If you start in one direction on the highway--and travel
far enough--you will come to the effete east. If you start in the
opposite direction--and travel a few hundred miles farther--you
will come to the distinctive west. Cedartown is neither effete
nor distinctive, nor is it even particularly pleasing to the
passing tourist. It is beautiful only in the eyes of those who
live here and in the memories of the Nebraska-born whose dwelling
in far places has given them moments of homesickness for the low
rolling hills, the swell and dip of the ripening wheat, the
fields of sinuously waving corn and the elusively fragrant odor
of alfalfa.</p>
<p>There are weeks when drifting snow and sullen sleet hold the
Cedartown community in their bitter grasp. There are times when
hot winds come out of the southwest and parch it with their
feverish breath. There are periods of monotonous drouth and
periods of dreary rain; but between these onslaughts there are
days so perfect, so filled with clover odors and the rich,
pungent smell of newly turned loam, so sumac-laden and
apple-burdened, that to the prairie-born there are no others as
lovely by mountain or lake or sea.</p>
<p>The paved streets of Cedartown lie primly parallel over the
obliterated tracks of the buffalo. The substantial buildings of
Cedartown stand smartly over the dead ashes of Indian campfires.
There are very few people left now in the community who have seen
the transition,--who have witnessed the westward trek of the last
buffalo, the flicker of the last burnt-out ember.</p>
<p>Old Abbie Deal was one of these.</p>
<p>Just outside the corporate limits of Cedartown stands the old
Deal home. It was once a farm-house, but the acreage around it
has been sold, and Cedartown has grown out to meet it, so that a
newcomer could not know where the town ceased and the country
began.</p>
<p>The house stands well back from the road in a big yard with a
long double row of cedars connecting the formal parlor entrance
and the small front gate. However, in the days when the Deals
lived there, scarcely any one used the little gate, or walked up
the grassy path between the cedars. All comers chose to enter by
the wide carriage-gate standing hospitably open and beckoning a
welcome to the lane road which runs past a row of Lombardy
poplars to the sitting-room porch.</p>
<p>The house itself is without distinction. There were no
architects in the community when the first of its rooms were
built. "We'll have the living-room there and the kitchen here,"
one told old Asy Drumm. And old Asy, with few comments and much
tobacco-chewing, placed the living-room there and the kitchen
here. The result was weatherproof, sturdy and artless. When the
country was new, homes, like dresses, were constructed more for
wearing qualities than beauty.</p>
<p>Twice, onto the first wing-and-ell, old Asy, a little more
glum and tobacco-stained, added a room, until the house had
attained its present form. That form, now, is not unlike an
aeroplane which has settled down between the cedars at the front
and the cottonwood wind-break in the rear. The parlor, protruding
toward the road, might contain the engine. The sitting-room to
the left and a bedroom to the right seem the wings, while the
dining-room, kitchen, and a summer kitchen beyond, trail out like
the long tail of the thing. If one's imagination is keen he can
even fancy that the fan-shaped colored-glass window in the parlor
may some day begin to whirl, propeller-like, and the whole house
rise up over the cedars.</p>
<p>The interior of the house, during Abbie Deal's lifetime, was a
combination of old-fashioned things which she had accumulated
through the years, and modern new ones which the grown children
had given her. A dull-finished, beautifully-proportioned radio
cabinet stood opposite a homemade, rudely painted what-not. A
kitchen table, with a little declivity in one corner, in which
old Doc Matthews had rolled pills in Civil War times, stood near
a white enameled case which was the last word in refrigeration. A
little crude oil-painting of a prairie sunset, which Abbie Deal
had done in the 'seventies, hung across the room from a really
exquisite study of the same subject, which a daughter, Mrs.
Frederick Hamilton Baker, had done forty years later.</p>
<p>Abbie Deal kept everything that had ever come into the house.
Every nail, every button, every string, was carefully hoarded.
"This would make a strong bottom for one of the kitchen chairs
some day," old Abbie Deal would say, when in truth the bottom of
the chair was as strong as its legs. Or, "Save those stubs of
candles from the Christmas tree. I can melt them and run them
into one big one." The characteristic was a hang-over from the
lean and frugal days when the country was new, when every tiny
thing had its use. As a consequence, there was in the house the
flotsam of all the years.</p>
<p>One of the daughters, Mrs. Harrison Scannell Rhodes, on her
annual visit out from Chicago, protested once: "Mother, if the
house only represented some one <i>period!</i> But it's such a
jumbled combination of things. They're not antique. They're just
<i>old.</i>"</p>
<p>"And why should it?" Old lady Deal flared up a little.
<i>"I'm</i> no one period. I've lived with spinning-wheels and
telephones . . . with tallow-dips and electric lights. <i>I'm</i>
not antique. I'm just <i>old.</i> It represents <i>me,</i>
doesn't it?"</p>
<p>You will infer from the retort that old Abbie Deal was a
strong personality. And you will be quite right. The fact that
she lived there in the old home until her eightieth year, over
the protests of children and grandchildren, attested to that. At
the time she was seventy, they began trying to pry her away from
"The Cedars." They talked over various plans for her--that she
should go to Omaha to live with Mack,--to Lincoln to live with
Margaret,--that she should have rooms at John's right there in
Cedartown,--that Grace should give up her teaching in Wesleyan
University temporarily and stay at home. When they had quite
definitely decided on the Lincoln home with Margaret, old Abbie
Deal spoke. "I will do nothing of the kind," she said with
finality. "I am going to stay right here. And kindly let me
alone. Because a woman is old, has she no rights?"</p>
<p>After that they did not press the matter. They "let her
alone," but they drove in frequently, for only the Chicago
daughter lived far away. Sometimes, on Sundays, the lane road
contained a half dozen high-powered cars parked there through the
dinner hour and the afternoon. But not one son or daughter could
ever become reconciled to the idea of driving away and leaving
her there.</p>
<p>"When I think of fire . . ." one of them would say.</p>
<p>"Or of her getting sick in the night . . ."</p>
<p>"Or falling . . . and no one to help her . . ."</p>
<p>"Or any one of a dozen things . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . something will happen to Mother some day."</p>
<p>And they were quite right. Something happened to Mother. Last
July on a late afternoon, while suppers cooked and children of
the north end of town played "Run, Sheep, Run," in her yard, old
lady Deal died. A neighbor woman found her lying across the foot
of the bed, fully dressed, while the slice of meat which she had
been cooking, burned to a crisp.</p>
<p>Of the five middle-aged children, seven grandchildren and
three great-grandchildren, not one was with her. They all came
hastily in response to the messages. Within two hours' time, a
shining limousine, two big sedans, and a roadster all stood in
the lane road. For the first time, when the cars turned into the
driveway by the Lombardy poplars, no little old white-haired
woman with bright brown eyes, had come hurrying out to give
cheery greeting. That queer, solemn hush of death hung over the
whole place. It was in the quivering droop of the
cottonwoods,--in the deepening of the prairie twilight,--in the
silence of the star-filled summer sky.</p>
<p>They all gathered in the parlor with its modern radio and its
old-fashioned what-not, its elaborate new floor-lamp and its
crude oil-painting. All of the children and several of the
grandchildren were there. Mackenzie Deal, the Omaha banker, was
there. John Deal, the Cedartown attorney and state legislator,
was there. Mrs. Harrison Scannell Rhodes of Chicago, who had been
visiting in Omaha, was there. Mrs. Frederick Hamilton Baker, of
Lincoln, and Miss Grace Deal, of Wesleyan University, were there.
They were people of poise, men and women not given to hysterical
demonstration, but at the first gathering they all broke down.
For a brief quarter of an hour there in the old parlor with its
familiar objects, they let their grief have sway. For a little
while there in the farm-home of their youth, they were but
children whose mother had left them lonely when night was coming
on.</p>
<p>When they had pulled themselves together, their greatest grief
seemed to be that she died alone. In deepest remorse they blamed
themselves. Standing there together in common sorrow, they said
the same things over and over to each other:</p>
<p>"Didn't she seem as well as ever to you last week?"</p>
<p>"I'll never forgive myself that I played bridge all
afternoon."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose she suffered much?"</p>
<p>"Or called for us?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it <i>dreadful?</i> Poor Mother! So many of us . . .
and not one of us here just when she needed us . . . and after
all she's done for us."</p>
<p>Only one,--Laura Deal,--a twelve-year-old granddaughter,
turned away from the window where she had been looking down the
long double row of cedars, and said in a clear, steady voice:
"<i>I</i> don't think it was so dreadful. I think it was kind of
nice. Maybe she didn't miss you." She looked slowly around the
circle of her elders. "When you stop to think about it, maybe she
didn't miss you <i>at all.</i> One time Grandma told me she was
the very happiest when she was living over all her memories.
Maybe . . ." She hesitated, a little shy at expressing the
thought in her heart, "Maybe she was doing that . . .
<i>then.</i>"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the story of the old lady who died while the meat
burned and the children played "Run, Sheep, Run," across her
yard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c01" id="c01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Abbie Mackenzie was old Abbie Deal's maiden name. And because
the first eight years of her life were interesting only to her
family, we shall skip over them as lightly as Abbie herself used
to skip a hoop on the high, crack-filled sidewalks in the little
village of Chicago, which stood at the side of a lake where the
bulrushes grew.</p>
<p>We find her then, at eight, in the year 1854, camping at night
on the edge of some timberland just off the beaten trail between
Dubuque and the new home in Blackhawk County, Iowa, to which the
little family was bound.</p>
<p>Abbie and a big sister of fifteen, Isabelle, were curled up
together under two old patchwork quilts in one of the wagons.
Another sister, Mary, and a little brother, Basil, were in the
other wagon with their mother. Sixteen-year-old James and
eleven-year-old Dennie, the men of the party, were sleeping near
the oxen, so that the warmth of the animals' bodies would keep
them warm.</p>
<p>Because she had propped up a small section of the wagon's
canvas cover, Abbie could see out into the night. The darkness
was a heavy, animate thing. It hung thickly about the wagon,
vaguely weird, remotely fearsome. It seemed to see and hear and
feel. It looked at Abbie with its stars, heard her whispered
words with its tree-leaves, felt of her warm little body with its
cool breeze fingers. Something about the queer closeness of it
almost frightened her. Something about the hushed silence of it
made her think of her father who had died two years before. She
summoned a picture of him into her mind, now,--recalling the
paleness of his long, thin face, the neatness of his neckcloth,
the gentle courtesy of his manner. Thinking of him so, she
punched Isabelle with an active elbow. "Belle, tell me about
Father and Mother."</p>
<p>The big girl was a little impatient. "I've told you everything
I remember."</p>
<p>"Tell it again."</p>
<p>"I should think you'd get tired of hearing the same
thing."</p>
<p>"Oh, I <i>never</i> do."</p>
<p>"Well . . . Father were what they call an aristocrat. He lived
in Aberdeen, Scotland, and his folks, the Mackenzies, had a town
house and two country houses. He belonged to the landed
gentry."</p>
<p>"What's landed gentry?"</p>
<p>"It means he were a gentleman and didn't have to work."</p>
<p>"Will James and Dennie be gentlemen?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. We lost all our money."</p>
<p>"Tell how we lost it." Abbie settled herself with complacence.
There was an element of satisfaction in having had such a foreign
substance at one time, even if it was long before her birth.</p>
<p>"Well . . . Father were a young man and never had to do
nothing but enjoy hisself, and he were out one day following the
hare and hounds . . ."</p>
<p>"Tell about that."</p>
<p>"That's hunting . . . a pack of hounds after a rabbit . . .
and he got away from the rest of them and were lost."</p>
<p>"The rabbit?"</p>
<p>"No, dunce-cap, . . . you know I mean father. And he come to a
peasant's cottage."</p>
<p>"What's peasant?"</p>
<p>"Awful poor people that have to work. But don't stop me every
minute. I always forget where I were. Well . . . and he wanted a
drink. And a sixteen-year-old peasant girl come out of the house.
They were Irish, but I guess they were working for some folks in
Scotland. Anyway it were Mother and she got a drink for him . . .
were pulling up the rope and he took the rope and pulled it up
hisself. Just think! A <i>gentleman . . .</i> and Mother were
sixteen . . . just <i>one</i> year older than me. Abbie, do you
suppose there'll be an aristocratic landed gentleman out in
Blackhawk County where we're going?"</p>
<p>"No . . . I don't think so. Go on."</p>
<p>"Well, Mother were pretty . . . Irish girls about
<i>always</i> are . . . and there were a rosebush and Father
asked her for a rose and she pulled one for him. Abbie, don't you
tell anybody, but I've got a little rosebush done up in a wet rag
in the wagon and I'm going to plant it out in Blackhawk
County."</p>
<p>"Ho! Ho! It takes years and years for a rosebush to grow big
enough to have flowers to pull off for a-<i>ris . . .</i> for
a-<i>rist</i> . . . for gentlemen. Go on."</p>
<p>"Anyway, Father took his rose and went away and the next day
he come back."</p>
<p>"Were he lost again?"</p>
<p>"No, dunce-cap! He come back to see Mother a-purpose. And he
come other days, even after that, and they would walk over the
heather hills together."</p>
<p>"What's feather hills?"</p>
<p>"Not feather! <i>Heather! . . .</i> a little kind of weedy
grass. And all the neighbors shook their heads and said they'd
seen <i>that</i> thing happen before from the gentry . . . and .
. ." Isabelle whispered solemnly, <i>"no good ever come of
it."</i></p>
<p>"What did they say that for?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you now. You wouldn't understand. When you're as
old as me, you will. But just the same, Father <i>did</i> marry
her and took her to Aberdeen to the big Mackenzie house. Mother
wore her best dress and her best head-shawl, but even then, all
fixed up that nice way, the Mackenzies didn't like her. Father's
mother were Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie and she were awful proud
and I hate her for not liking Mother. I hate her so bad that I'm
sorry I'm named for her. If Mother would let me, I'd change it to
Rosamond. I read about a Rosamond and she . . ."</p>
<p>"Go on about her . . . not <i>you."</i></p>
<p>"Well . . . she were ashamed of Mother, but she had to take
her in because she were Father's wife, and she dressed her up
grand and tried to make her different. But when Mother would go
back to see her folks, she'd put on her peasant dress and wear
her shawl on her head and slip away. And Sundays when the
Mackenzies would go to the kirk . . ."</p>
<p>"What's kirk?"</p>
<p>"Church. Where were I? Oh . . . the aristocrats set down below
and the peasants all set up in the loft . . ."</p>
<p>"Like a hay loft?"</p>
<p>"No. Stop interrupting, or I won't tell you one thing more.
And Mother wouldn't leave her folks, the O'C'onners, so Father
went and set with them and the Mackenzies were just <i>sick</i>
with shame. Then Grandfather Mackenzie died, and a long time
afterward . . . after Janet and James and Mary and Dennie and I
were all born, Grandmother Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie . . ."</p>
<p>"I just <i>admire</i> to hear that name . . ."</p>
<p>"There you go again. Now I'm through telling it."</p>
<p>"Please . . . I won't stop you again."</p>
<p>"Well. . . . Grandmother died, too. Then Father come to
America on a sailing vessel, just for a pleasure trip, and he
were gone so long and folks thought he weren't coming back at all
. . . and Mother cried something terrible . . . and Father had
signed a note for a man . . ."</p>
<p>"What's signed a . . . ? Oh, . . . go on."</p>
<p>"And it made him lose all his money. Men come and put cards up
on the house and stables while he were gone and the signs said
there were going to be a roup there."</p>
<p>"What's . . . ? Go on."</p>
<p>"A roup's an auction sale. There were fifteen saddle-horses in
the stables, but after the roup cards went up Mother were not
allowed to touch one on account of the law, and so her and James
and Janet walked twenty-seven miles to have her father and mother
come and bid in some of her things. She's got 'em yet in that
little wooden chest with calf-skin all over it. It's in the other
wagon and I know just what's in it because I saw 'em. There's a
white silk shawl with big solid roses in the corners . . . all
<i>four</i> corners . . . and a jeweled fan . . . and a breastpin
with lavender sets and a string of pearls. There are just as many
things as there are girls in our family and Mother says each girl
are to have one for a keepsake. I know which one I want . . . the
silk shawl. I tried it on once when Mother were gone and I looked
a lot like the painting of Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie that hung up
on the landing of the stairway in the great hall. Course, you
understand, Abbie, I never said I hated her <i>looks</i> . .
."</p>
<p>"Which one is Mother going to give me?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. She aren't going to give 'em to us until our
wedding days. Of course, Janet didn't get hers on <i>her</i>
wedding day because she got married out here in Blackhawk County
before we come, but Mother'll give it to her to-morrow when we
get there."</p>
<p>"Go on . . . you're forgetting the end of the story."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, you know it anyway. When Father got back to
Liverpool he heard all about the money and the property being
lost, and the things being sold, and he never even went to
Aberdeen but sent for Mother and all five of us children to come
to Liverpool and we all crossed the ocean. I were seven and I can
remember just as well . . . and when we got to New York, you were
born."</p>
<p>Abbie breathed a sigh of relief. It was a welcome respite
after a narrow escape. With every telling of the story, almost it
seemed for a time that she was not to be born.</p>
<p>"Now tell about the painting of Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie that
hung on the landing of the stairway in the great hall." Abbie
rolled the magic words from her lips in delicious anticipation.
This was the part she liked the best of all.</p>
<p>"Well . . . it were beauteous. It were in a great heavy gold
frame . . . and as big as life. I can remember it just as well.
In the picture she were young, you know . . ."</p>
<p>"And beautiful . . ." prompted Abbie.</p>
<p>"And beautiful. She had reddish-brown hair like yours . . .
and she were standing by a kind-of . . . a table-thing, and she
had on a velvet dress that swept down and around her . . . and
she had a hat in her hand with a plume . . ."</p>
<p>"A flowing white plume . . ." corrected Abbie.</p>
<p>"A flowing white plume," repeated the more matter-of-fact
Isabelle. "And she had pretty hands and long slender fingers that
tapered at the ends."</p>
<p>Abbie held her hands up to the opening of the canvas on the
wagon and peered at them in the moonlight. The fingers were long
and slender and they tapered at the ends. She sighed with
satisfaction, and slipped them under the old patched quilt.</p>
<p>"And nobody knows what become of the picture?" It was half
statement, half question, as though from the vast fund of
information which Isabelle possessed, she might, some day,
suddenly remember what had become of the picture.</p>
<p>"No. It were sold at the roup. I don't know who got it."</p>
<p>Abbie sighed again, but not with satisfaction. Of all the
beautiful things that were sold, she felt that she could have
missed seeing any of them with better grace than the portrait. In
her immature way, she resented the sale more than any other
thing,--the passing of the lovely lady into other hands. Jewels,
money, furniture,--they seemed lifeless, inanimate things beside
the picture of the woman who was flesh of her flesh. It ought to
have been saved. It was their own grandmother who stood there
forever inside the heavy gold frame, in the dark velvet dress
that swept around her,--and with the flowing white plume--and the
long slender fingers that tapered at the ends.</p>
<p>"Well, I wish we had it here with us, Belle. We could have it
all wrapped up in quilts in the wagon . . . and then some day out
in Blackhawk County when we get rich, we could build us a grand
house with a wide curving stairway and hang the picture on the
landing . . . and everybody that come . . ."</p>
<p>"Abbie! Belle!" A voice came suddenly from the other wagon.
"Sure 'n' you're the talkers. Settle yoursel's now. We want to
get a good early start by sunup."</p>
<p>Abbie started. From a dreamy journey into the fields of
romance she had been drawn back to the prosaic world of reality
by her mother's voice. She could not quite reconcile good fat
Mother with the romantic figure of the pretty girl at the well,
picking a rose for an aristocratic gentleman. But then, Mother
was almost an old woman, now,--thirty-seven.</p>
<p>Abbie turned to the opening in the canvas cover and looked out
again at the night. Yellow-white, the moon rose higher over the
dark clumps of trees. A thousand stars, looking down, paled at
its rising. An owl gave its mournful call. The smell of burning
maple boughs came from the fire. A wolf howled in the distance so
that James got up and took out the other gun from the wagon.
There was a constant tick-tacking in the timber,--all the little
night creatures at their work. It was queer how it all hurt
you,--how the odor of the night, the silver sheen of the moon,
the moist feeling of the dew, the whispering of the night breeze,
how, somewhere down in your throat it hurt you. It was sad, too,
that this evening would never come again. The night winds were
blowing it away. You could not stop the winds and you could not
stop Time. It went on and on,--and on. To-morrow night would come
and the moon would look down on this same spot,--the trees and
the grass, the wagon-tracks and the dead campfire. But she would
not be here. Her heart swelled with an emotion which she could
not name. Tears came to her eyes. The telling of the story always
brought that same feeling.</p>
<p>"Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie," she said it over until it took
upon itself the cadence of a melody, the rhythm of a poem. "I
shall be like her," she thought. "I have hair like her now and
hands like her. I shall be lovely. And I shall do wonderful
things . . . sing before big audiences and paint pictures inside
of gold frames and write things in a book." She wondered how you
got things put in a book. There were some books in one of the
wooden chests over in the other wagon. A man with a long name
that began <i>S-h-a-k-e-s . . .</i> had made some of them. They
had been Father's. Mother didn't read them. She didn't read
anything but her Bible. Even that was hard for her, so that she
read the same verses over and over. Yes, she would be like Father
and Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, not like Mother's family with
their cottage on the side of the hill and their dark shawls over
their heads. She would be rich and lovely . . . with a velvet
dress and a long sweeping plume . . . under the moon . . . and
the night wind, . . . that felt of your body with its long . . .
slender fingers . . . that tapered at the ends . . .</p>
<p>Abbie Mackenzie slept,--little Abbie Mackenzie, with the
mixture of the two strains of blood,--with the stout body of the
O'Conners and the slender hands of the Mackenzies,--with the
O'Conner sturdiness and the Mackenzie refinement. And she is to
need them both,--the physical attributes of the peasant and the
mental ones of the aristocrat,--the warm heart of the Irish and
the steadfastness of the Scotch. Yes, Abbie Mackenzie is to need
them both in the eighty years she is to live,--courage and
love,--a song upon her lips and a lantern in her hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c02" id="c02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The sun, shining through the propped-up canvas of the wagon,
wakened Abbie. Wide-eyed, she looked out through the aperture
upon the same setting of the night before. But now it was
changed. The child lived a life in each of two distinct worlds
and it is not possible to say which one she most enjoyed. One of
them was made of moonbeams and star-dust, of night winds and
cloud fancies, of aristocratic gentlemen and lovely ladies. The
other was the equally pleasant one of boiled potatoes and salt
pork, of games with Basil and Mary, of riding a-top old Buck or
picking wild flowers at the edge of the timber.</p>
<p>Just now the prosaic world of everyday seemed the more
attractive of the two. James had replenished the night fire and
Mother was cooking breakfast, with the odor of frying pork and
corn-cakes strong on the air. The team of horses and the oxen
were eating close by, the horses guzzling their grain noisily,
the oxen chewing slowly and stolidly.</p>
<p>Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie was a heavy, dumpy woman, her body
the shape of a pudding-bag tied in the middle. One shawl was
wrapped around the shapeless figure and a smaller one, over her
head, was knotted under her fat chin. Strands of heavy black hair
showed around the edges of the head-shawl, and the face enclosed
in its folds was round and smooth, fat and placid. Only her dark
Irish eyes, the color of the blue-black waters at Kilkee, and a
dimple in the middle of her rolling chin, gave a touch of reality
to the old romance of the peasant girl.</p>
<p>This was the last day of the journey which had been of three
weeks' duration. (Six decades later James Mackenzie was to make
the journey back with a grandson in one day.)</p>
<p>Breakfast over, the little cavalcade set out with much noisy
chatter,--reminders not to forget this or that.</p>
<p>"Did ye put out the last o' the fire, Dennie?"</p>
<p>"Fasten that buckle on Whitey's bridle, Belle."</p>
<p>The mother drove the horse team,--James, the oxen. Walking
along beside the latter, James' boyish "Gee" or "Haw" or "Whoa
How" rang out with valiant attempts to make the notes stentorian.
Buck was a red and white animal, Boy a brindle. As they walked,
they swung their huge heads rhythmically from side to side, the
brass buttons a-top their horns shining in the morning sun.
Almost at the first rod's length of the journey little Basil had
to stop the procession to change from one wagon to the other.
Belle rode on the seat with her mother, but, because it was early
and cool, Abbie, Mary and Dennie walked behind, darting off the
trail to gather Mayflowers or wild Bouncing-Bets. Sometimes they
jumped over the young rosin-weeds and wild blue phlox and
occasionally they caught on the back of the wagon, clutching onto
the household goods and swinging their feet off the ground for a
few moments.</p>
<p>About nine, they forded a stream. The oxen ahead crossed
slowly, lumberingly, with many stops in that foolish, stolid way
they had. When they were across, Mother Mackenzie drove her team
into the creek bed. As the horses were going up the bank, one of
them stumbled, crowding against its mate. There was a creaking,
and backing, a shouting and a tipping. One sack of flour began
falling slowly, and then another and another. Eight sacks of
flour, pushing against each other, slipped slowly into the water
like fat, clumsy, old men, reluctant to wet their feet.</p>
<p>Maggie Mackenzie was out and managing her horses by way of
their bridles, while James, running back from his own wagon,
assisted in bringing order out of the catastrophe. Then some one
called excitedly, "Look out for the bedding," and two great
pillows started floating down stream with majestic motion, as
though the geese from which their contents had been plucked, were
suddenly coming to life.</p>
<p>"Och!" And "Och!" The mother wrung her hands in distress.
Eight sacks of flour and two pillows were a fortune.</p>
<p>Abbie and Dennie and little Basil, their laughter high with
excitement, all ran along the side of the creek bed after the
pillows. In the meantime, James and Belle were wading into the
stream and pulling out the sacks. To the mother the disaster
seemed more than she could bear. "Och! If I ever get there," said
Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie, "sure 'n' I'll never l'ave the spot."
Sure, and she never did. Many years later she died a quarter of a
mile from the place where she first stepped out of the wagon.</p>
<p>When the last sack was retrieved, the entire family, with much
dire foreboding, crowded around James, who was opening a sack to
see how the contents fared. It was as though the whole of life's
future hung on the outcome. To their extreme relief the wet flour
had formed but a thin paste, which, with a few moments drying in
the sun, now high and hot, would form a crust and keep the
precious contents unharmed.</p>
<p>In spite of the delay the family reached the settlement on the
Cedar River by the middle of the afternoon and stopped near the
log cabin of Tom Graves, the man whom the older sister Janet had
come out to marry. Janet, herself, hearing the creaking of the
wagons, came hurrying down the grassy trail to meet them, a
three-weeks-old baby in her arms. The baby was something by way
of surprise to the entire group of relatives, his arrival having
taken place after the family had started westward.</p>
<p>Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie, with much clucking and chirping and
adjustment of clothing, welcomed her first grandchild.</p>
<p>"Sure 'n' he's the big one. How did ye get along? Is he good?
Did ye have a doctor or a neighbor woman?"</p>
<p>Janet answered them all even while her mother was still
talking. Oh, yes, there was a doctor,--Doc Matthews over at town.
Cedar Falls was quite a place. It had a sawmill and a hotel and a
store, a dozen log cabins, and a few frames ones. The
school-house had the only tower bell in the state. For pay Tom
was to haul in a load of wood for the doctor's office stove,--he
had a two-roomed house, part log and part frame.</p>
<p>The oxen behind them slathered and snorted. There was the
smell in the air of newly-cut chips. The woods back of the cabin
looked thick and impenetrable beyond the short arrows of the sun.
And then Tom Graves, himself, came out of the timber, his ax, the
insignia of the fight, on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Here is my mother, Tom, and this is Belle and that one is
Mary. And that boy is James and this one Dennie and here's little
Basil. And over there with the reddish-brown hair is Abbie,--we
almost forgot her."</p>
<p>So much was to be said, and all at once. "We've got a house
all ready for you, Mother. It was Grandpa Deal's sheep shed. The
Deals have been here for three years, but they've moved down
farther on the prairie now in a fine big log house, and you can
have this until you get your own cabin done. We've cleaned it all
out for you and hung a thick quilt over the opening, and if it
storms you can come in with us."</p>
<p>And so Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie, who had lived in the great
Aberdeen town house and on the two Scotch country estates, was to
make her bed now in a sheep shed.</p>
<p>Every one turned in to help with the settling. From the wagons
they took out the walnut bedsteads and the bedding and the
highboy. They brought in the heavy, cumbersome guns and the
powder-horn and the splint-bottom chairs. Maggie Mackenzie
brought in her flat-iron into which one put glowing hickory
embers through an iron door, and she hung up the iron tallow-lamp
with a home-spun wick hanging over the side like a tongue hanging
grotesquely from the side of a mouth. If she could have foreseen
that two granddaughters, Mrs. Harrison Scannell Rhodes and Mrs.
Frederick Hamilton Baker, were going to stage a polite but
intensive campaign over which one could have the old tallow-lamp
in her sun parlor, a half century later, she would have shaken
her fat sides with laughter.</p>
<p>Everything was out of the wagon now,--everything but one.
Abbie, standing in the grassy trail in front of the old sheep
shed, was watching for it. On tiptoe there in her ankle-length
starched dress, her red-brown hair wound around her head and
tucked into a snood, she was the picture of watchful waiting. She
might have been carved in marble as "Expectancy."</p>
<p>"Let me! Let me!" she called, when her mother was bringing out
the calf-skin-covered box from under the wagon seat.</p>
<p>"If ye'll carry it carefu'."</p>
<p>No need to caution Abbie to be careful. In a warm feeling of
pleasure over the temporary possession, she clasped her arms
around its hairy sides and the "M.OC." initials formed by
nail-heads.</p>
<p>Inside the box lay all the accouterments of another life. In
its skin-covered depths was all the equipment of an entirely
different world. They were symbols of things in life to come.
They represented the future in which she would some day live. She
got down on her knees on the dirt floor, with its earthy odor,
and pushed the little chest into the far, dark corner under her
mother's bed. Lovingly and lingeringly she relinquished her hold
upon it. For a few moments she saw herself in that future, her
red-brown hair in curls, over her shoulders a white silk shawl
with roses in the corners, its folds held together with a
lavender breastpin. There was a string of pearls around her neck,
and she was waving a jeweled fan with long, white fingers that
tapered at the ends. There was soft music playing. She came out
on a high stage ready to sing. Lovely ladies and courtly men were
clapping their hands. Some of them stood up. She smiled at them
and waved her jeweled fan. . . .</p>
<p>"Abbie . . . Abbie . . . where are you?" Quite suddenly, the
gorgeous trappings fell away. She was back in the everyday world,
hearing loud voices calling her.</p>
<p>"Abbie! . . ." The voices were raised high in fright. She
scrambled out backward from under the bed.</p>
<p>"Abbie . . . Abbie . . ." Dennis and Mary were running toward
her, their faces white with fear. "The Indians are coming. A man
here on horseback says the Indians are coming down the
river."</p>
<p>Abbie scrambled back under the bed and brought out the hairy
chest in her arms. Not to any wild and heathenish Indian was
Abbie Mackenzie intending to relinquish the only tangible tie
that bound her to the lovely lady.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c03" id="c03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the midst of the hurry and confusion and fright, Abbie
gathered that they were all to get back into the wagons and "go
down to Grandpa Deal's," wherever that was.</p>
<p>Everything that could be handled easily was thrown into the
wagons. Janet rolled a fresh batch of bread and raised doughnuts
into a homespun tablecloth. Tom tied old Whitey to the back of
his wagon and put her new calf in the end of the box so she could
see her offspring and not bellow for it. Abbie clutched the hairy
chest in protecting arms. The cavalcade started lumberingly down
the river road. Through the dark timber they drove, over spongy
moist leaves, past thickets of sumac and hazel-brush, their
hearts pounding in alarm, their bodies tense with fear, every
tree the potential hiding place of an Indian.</p>
<p>Out of the cool river road and onto the hot, flat prairie they
came as suddenly as one opens a door upon a bright, heated room.
For two miles they drove over the faintly marked prairie trail,
coming then to another wooded section and to the largest house in
the community,--a big log structure which looked palatial to
Abbie's eyes after Tom Graves' one-roomed cabin and the sheep
shed.</p>
<p>Other horse and ox teams were hitched to the straw-roofed log
stable. Other families were scurrying into the house with smoked
hams and batches of bread and valued possessions in their arms.
Not far from the back door of the big log house, Abbie, still
grasping the hairy chest, stopped to watch a boy of twelve or
thirteen caressing the sleek, quivering head of a young deer,
tied to a tree by a strap around its neck.</p>
<p>A small, severe-looking woman in a black calico dress, with a
black netting cap tied under her sharply pointed chin, was
scolding nervously. "No, Willie, you can't. I won't have it. It's
bad enough to have the whole kit 'n' bilin' in the country comin'
'n' trackin' up,--all the rag-snag 'n' bob-tails bringin' their
stuff."</p>
<p>"But, Mother," the boy plead, "I'll keep her by herself. I'll
get her up the loft stairs."</p>
<p>"No--you sha'n't, Willie Deal."</p>
<p>And then a big, powerful man came out,--a man with only one
arm, his left sleeve pinned to the side of his coat. He had a
shock of wiry black hair, and an equally wiry beard which gave
him an unkempt look. But his eyes were blue and twinkling and
kind,--they held the calmness of blue ice, but not its
coldness.</p>
<p>He put his one hand on the boy's dark head, now, and said
quietly, "You'd best let her go, son. She'll take care of
herself,--and it's only fair to give her her freedom."</p>
<p>Without a word the boy cut the strap at the fawn's throat, and
even while he was unloosing the piece around her neck, she darted
from him lightly, gracefully, into the hazel-brush.</p>
<p>Inside the big log house where all seemed confusion, Abbie,
after a time, sought out the dark-haired boy.</p>
<p>"Do you think you'll ever get her back?" she asked shyly.</p>
<p>"Get what?"</p>
<p>"Your little deer."</p>
<p>"Naw, . . . never." The boy turned his head away.</p>
<p>Abbie's heart seemed bursting with sorrow for him. There was
that word again,--<i>never.</i> It was the saddest word! It made
her throat hurt. Willie Deal would never, never have his little
deer again.</p>
<p>With his head still averted, the boy said tensely, "I found
her . . . 'n' raised her . . . myself."</p>
<p>Abbie put her hand out gently and touched the boy's arm.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Her voice held deep sympathy.</p>
<p>"Aw . . ." He threw up his fine dark head. "I didn't
care."</p>
<p>But Abbie knew it was not so. Abbie knew that he cared.</p>
<p>It seems precarious business to take time to describe Grandpa
and Grandma Deal, when a band of disgruntled Indians is reported
on its way down the Shell Rock, but, pending its arrival, one
ought to know a little of Gideon Deal and his wife. They were not
yet out of their forties. Indeed, their youngest daughter,
Regina, was only nine, but through older offspring scattered
about the community, several grandchildren had been presented to
them, and so, to differentiate them from other and younger Deals,
the titles "Grandpa" and "Grandma" had been bestowed early upon
them.</p>
<p>To the other settlers Grandpa Deal seemed as substantial as
the native hickory timber in whose clearing he had built his
house. He was both freighter and farmer. Two of the grown sons
worked his place, while he himself drove the six-ox-team over the
long trail to Dubuque and back, with freight for the whole
community. For this,--and for his reputation as a wit,--he was
known far and wide. To fully appreciate his wit, one must have
taken Grandma Deal into account, for she was the background
against which his droll sayings stood forth. The little wiry
woman, fretful, energetic and humorless, was intolerant of
wasting time in fun-making. Grandpa Deal, kind, easy-going and
jolly, was always picking up every little saying of his partner's
to bandy it about with sly drollness. There was never any loud
laughter on his part, just a twinkle in the sharp blue eyes
appreciative of his outlook on life. Grandma Deal spent her time
hustling about, darting in and out, scolding at Grandpa, finding
fault with the children, the well-sweep, the weather, everything
that came under her eagle eye or into her busy brain.</p>
<p>Just now, however, Grandma was not scolding. Grandpa was not
joking. The news of impending disaster had brought them to a
common ground of fear. Most of the other families of the
community had gathered now in the larger and stronger Deal home
in response to the rumor of the Indian uprising. Already the men
were stationing guns near windows and barring and barricading
doors. Several women were running bullets in the little
salamander stove, a queer affair whose short legs in front and
long legs in the back, gave it the appearance of an inverted
giraffe. One woman was hysterical; another a little out of her
mind from fear, kept wanting to go back out doors where there was
air.</p>
<p>All night they waited for whatever Fate had in store for them.
In the morning, a man rode up on horseback, a young boy, about
Willie Deal's age, behind him in the saddle. It was Doc Matthews,
who had come to bring word that the hostile band of Indians had
gone north.</p>
<p>Immediately there was the confusion of getting ready to leave.
Grandpa Deal told those who lived farthest away to stay and make
a visit for the day. Abbie could hear Grandma Deal sputtering
about her husband's freehanded hospitality.</p>
<p>The boy who came with Doc Matthews was his son Ed. He had been
east all year to a boys' boarding school. He was dressed in a
nice suit and a flat white collar and a little round hat.</p>
<p>He stood and looked at Willie Deal in his homespun suit.
Willie Deal stood and looked at Eddie Matthews from the
Philadelphia boarding-school. Their contempt seemed mutual.</p>
<p>The Indian scare, then, had gone into nothing. The wagons went
lumbering back across the prairie and through the damp, dark
river road where the hazel-brush and sumac knotted together under
the native oaks and hickories.</p>
<p>All summer long, the Mackenzies lived in the sheep shed, while
their own log house was being built. James and Tom Graves were
building it, and Dennie was helping, battening the inside with
long split saplings and filling the chinks with mud.</p>
<p>All summer long, Abbie went happily in and out of the sheep
shed with the patchwork quilt in front for the door. There were
so many lovely things to do that one did not know how to find
time for them all. There were flowers in the deep, dark recesses
of the Big Woods,--wild honeysuckles and Bouncing-Bets and tall
ferns that one could pretend were long, sweeping, white
plumes.</p>
<p>Sometimes Abbie would take one of the longest of the ferns
and, with a slender twig, pin it on a wild grapevine leaf or a
plantain for a hat. Then she would drape one of her mother's dark
shawls around her sturdy little body, and standing on a grassy
hillock in the clearing, pretend she was Isabelle
Anders-Mackenzie, the lovely lady.</p>
<p>And then she had a whole set of dishes hidden in the hollow of
an oak at the edge of the timberland. James had made them for her
from acorns, removing the nut and whittling little handles for
the cups. And she had a child for which she must care constantly.
It was an elongated-shaped stone with a small round formation on
the end for its head. She put little Basil's outgrown dress on it
and a knitted bonnet. She liked the feeling of the stone against
her breast. It seemed heavy and like a real baby. Sometimes in
carrying it about, her heart would swell in potential mother love
for it. But sometimes there was no need to pretend about a baby,
for there was Janet's real, live one to hold and rock. Janet had
a low, wooden trundle-bed for him that pushed under the big bed.
It was rough on the outside and the ends were made from the sawed
round disks of a tree.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Willie Deal came up to the Big Woods with his
shaggy-haired father to see Tom Graves. Willie Deal had
remembered Abbie and brought her a plant in a clay jar he had
made. The plant was a green, lacy, fern-like thing, and there
were three little, round, scarlet balls on it.</p>
<p>"Whatever are they?" Abbie wanted to know.</p>
<p>"They're love apples," Willie told her. "But don't you ever
dare put one up to your mouth. They're tremendous poisonous."</p>
<p>Abbie promised that she never, never would so much as touch
the poison. For how could Willie Deal and Abbie Mackenzie in the
'fifties know anything about vitamine-filled tomatoes?</p>
<p>And then, in the fall, Janet's baby was not quite well. No one
seemed to know what the matter could be. Maggie O'Conner
Mackenzie doctored him with castor oil and peppermint. Grandma
Deal sent word by Tom Graves to give him sassafras tea and tie a
little bag of asafetida around his neck. When he seemed no
better, Janet, pale and worried, said maybe they ought to send
for Dr. Matthews. Abbie was frightened beyond measure when she
heard that, for she well knew that a doctor was the last resort
for saving one who was sick. Tom went out immediately to saddle a
horse and go for the doctor. Janet told Abbie to hold the baby
while she went out to the lean-to kitchen for warm water. Mother
Mackenzie had gone over to her own home for flannel cloths.</p>
<p>And then, Abbie was calling them and crying all in the same
breath, "Janet, . . . Mother, . . . come quick . . . oh, come . .
."</p>
<p>Janet was in the room like a flash, a wild bittern at the call
of its young. Abbie could scarcely talk for crying: "I was just
holding him as steady. He acted queer, . . . and threw up his
arms. He got kind of bluish. What ought I to 've done?"</p>
<p>Doctor Matthews came with Tom. He said, yes, the baby was
dead. Janet was wild with grief. Sitting on the edge of the bed,
she rocked the little cold form back and forth in her arms and
would not let them take him from her. Rachel, who lives again in
every grieving mother, was crying for her child and would not be
comforted.</p>
<p>Over in their own cabin, Abbie sobbed aloud on the bed.
Suddenly she sat up, "I hate God," she said. Maggie Mackenzie
hushed her quickly and told her it was tremendous wicked to say
that.</p>
<p>"But he made death. I hate death. I <i>hate</i> it."</p>
<p>"The poor colleen," her mother said to Belle. "She's smart
like the Mackenzies, . . . but faith . . . an' she has the Irish
heart."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c04" id="c04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time Abbie was eleven, she was doing more work. Life
was not all play now. One of her tasks was to thread the wicks
into candle molds, for her slim fingers were more agile than her
mother's short, thick ones. She had to poke the long wick-string
through all of the six molds, and carefully loop the tops over a
stick to keep them from slipping. Her mother would then pour the
hot tallow into the molds and set it away to harden. Abbie was
always anxious to see the finished product slip out. She would
watch her mother plunge the molds into hot water to loosen the
hard grease, and then, "Let me, . . . let me," she would call,
and sometimes Maggie Mackenzie would let her carefully work the
shining cream-colored candles out of their containers.</p>
<p>There were a dozen other tasks for her to perform,--drive the
cows to drink, gather eggs from the chickens' stolen nests among
the sheds and stacks, and the daily one of going to school.</p>
<p>But even work could take upon itself a mask of fun. One could
pretend, when threading the wicks into candle molds, that one was
stringing pearls accidentally broken at the ball,--that the long
walk through the hazel-brush to the schoolhouse was between rows
of admiring spectators who, instead of a mere rustling in the
wind, were whispering, "There she goes,--there goes Abbie
Mackenzie, the singer."</p>
<p>For Abbie was always singing from the elevation of her grassy
knoll in the clearing. It made her happy to walk up the little
incline, turn and bow to an unseen audience, throw up her head
and let forth her emotions in song. Her heart would swell in a
feeling of oneness with Nature and the Creator of it, and there
would come to her a great longing for things she did not quite
know or understand.</p>
<p>The log school-house sat in a clearing of timber just out of
the river's high-water line. The hazel-brush and sumac tangled
together under its windows and there were butternut and black
walnut trees behind it. The desks were rough shelves against the
walls on three sides of the room, and in front of them were three
long benches of equal height, so that a strapping six-foot boy or
a tiny six-year-old girl could, with economy, use the same
seats.</p>
<p>While studying, the children sat with their backs toward the
teacher, but when it was recitation time they had to put their
legs up over the benches and turn to face him. Abbie always
crawled over slowly, holding modestly on to her dress and three
petticoats. But Regina Deal would flip over daringly in a
whirlwind of skirts and pantalets. The cloaks and bonnets were
hung on nails on the one side of the room which contained no
desk-shelf. The water-pail and dipper were on a bench by the
door, which made a sloppily wet corner, excepting on those winter
days when the dipper froze in the pail. The room was heated by a
stove in the center, and one unhappily roasted or froze in
proportion to his proximity to the stove.</p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of the dinner buckets were also frozen
and one had to thaw them out before eating. On fall days, a few
of the more adventuresome of the squirrels and chipmunks whisked
in and out of the window-opening in the logs, purloining the
crumbs for waiting families.</p>
<p>In the spring, when the maple sap ran, every one crossed the
river in flat-bottomed boats and helped in the little sugar camp.
Louise and Regina Deal showed Abbie and Mary Mackenzie how to
make maple eggs. They took tiny pieces of shell off the small
ends of eggs, carefully removed the raw contents, ran the maple
sap into the hollow molds, and after it had hardened, picked off
the shells,--and behold, there was a platter of candy ready for
the winter parties.</p>
<p>The fall in which Abbie was eleven, the entire crowd of young
people on the north side of the river was invited to the
Mackenzies'. Already there was a social distinction being drawn
between the north, or country side, and the south, or town side,
of the river. The party was for Belle, who was soon to be
married. Belle had planted her rosebush by the log cabin, but the
chickens had pecked at it, and the pigs had rooted under it, and
no aristocratic gentleman had come by,--only a plain farmer boy
who had hired out to Tom Graves.</p>
<p>The young folks came in lumber wagons along the river road
under the full moon. The few pieces of furniture were set out of
doors to make room for the party, and there were tallow candles
lighted and placed high up on shelves. In an iron kettle there
was taffy cooking to be pulled later, and platters of pop-corn
balls and dishes of maple drops, into which hickory nuts,
butternuts, hazelnuts or walnuts had been stirred.</p>
<p>The crowd played dancing games to their own singing and
hand-clapping:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"I won't have none of your weevily wheat,<br>
     I won't have none of your barley,<br>
I won't have none but the best of wheat,<br>
     To make a cake for Charley."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>When the fun was at its height, a horse and rider drew up at
the door, and some one called out, "Hey there, . . . you." The
young folks, upon going out to see who it was, found Ed Matthews
there with a deer carcass, which he had been pulling behind him
with a rope. Ed, who was sixteen now, was dressed in "city"
hunter togs, a leather-looking coat and pants and a cap with a
long bill in front. His boots were almost hip-high and fitted
snugly to his legs.</p>
<p>When they were crowding around to look at the deer, Abbie
first saw the strap drawn taut on its neck. Immediately, she was
looking up into the face of Will Deal,--a darkened, flashing
face. The young folks all discussed the queer fact of the strap
being on the deer's neck. But Will Deal said nothing. And Abbie,
sensing that Will did not want to tell about it, said
nothing.</p>
<p>Regina and Louise and Mary Mackenzie all invited Ed Matthews
in to the party. He accepted, and immediately became the center
of the games and dancing. But for some reason the party was not
so pleasant. For some reason, Ed Matthews, in his city hunter
togs, had spoiled the party.</p>
<p>When the horses were hitched to the wagons and the young folks
were all leaving, Abbie touched Will Deal on the arm.</p>
<p>"It was your little deer, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"I 'spose so."</p>
<p>Something intuitive made Abbie say, "I'm sorry <i>he</i> was
the one who shot it."</p>
<p>Will's face flashed darkly, "Aw, shucks! . . . I don't
care."</p>
<p>But Abbie knew that it was not so. Abbie knew that Will Deal
cared.</p>
<p>Two years later, Grandpa Deal was sent by the county to the
General Assembly. Word trickled back to the settlement that he
was well liked by his constituents, and that he was called "Old
Blackhawk" and "the wag of the House."</p>
<p>Will Deal, eighteen now, had done the freighting from Dubuque
all fall during his father's absence, but when spring came, an
older brother assumed the business while Will took over the farm
work. Once when Abbie came by, he stopped the team and sat on the
plow-handle and called out to her to come and hear a letter from
his father. It began, "Dear Friend," and ended, "This from your
affectionate father." It said that he hoped Will could
comfortably till the fields, that there was some talk of dividing
two of the counties, that board was tremendous high,--three
dollars a week,--that his sister, Harriett, had left on the
stage, that the Pikes Peakers were beginning to run, and that he
looked for quite a rush this spring for the gold regions. Abbie
felt quite proud of the fact that a young man like Will Deal
would read his letters to a thirteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>It was only a few weeks later, that an old Springfield friend
of Grandpa Deal's was nominated for the presidency of the United
States. When Grandpa Deal came home, he said that if you'd known
Abe Lincoln as well as he had, you'd never in the world think
that he'd have been picked for the nomination, but just the same
there was hoss sense inside his long hide.</p>
<p>All summer long one heard political talk here and
there,--about slavery and secessionists and the outcome of the
fall election. Men would stop in wagons on the river road and
talk so long that their teams would amble a short way into the
woods, cropping at the juicy ferns. Grandma Deal scolded all
summer about it. Abbie heard her say that she kept dinner hot so
many times for Grandpa, who was talking to groups around the
store over in town or on the schoolhouse steps, that she had a
notion to quit cooking for him altogether.</p>
<p>All winter the talk grew thicker and more heated. While Abbie
did not fully understand it all, she knew in February, when the
Southern Confederacy had been established, that things were at
some sort of a crisis. But from hearing Grandpa Deal talk, she
felt confident that when Abe Lincoln would take his seat in
March, everything was going to be all right. And Grandpa Deal was
to have plenty of time to talk, for his old job of freighting
from Dubuque was to be taken from him. Slowly, but surely, the
construction of the Dubuque and Sioux City road was being carried
westward.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln took his seat in March, but everything was not
going to be all right. Twenty-seven days later the first iron
horse from Dubuque shrieked its triumphant way across the Deal
farm, and on into Cedar Falls, and the old-time freighter's task
was finished. The train's arrival was timely for the community,
inasmuch as events were to follow which would suspend
construction and cause Cedar Falls to remain the western terminus
of the road for four years.</p>
<p>Abbie had now passed her fourteenth birthday. On an April
afternoon, with the river high and clods of snow still at the
roots of trees, she went into the timber to look for anemones and
Dutchmen's breeches, for dog-toothed violets and the first signs
of Mayflower buds. Coming out on her own particular grassy knoll
in the clearing, she went up to the hillock, in one of those
moments of desire to let out her feelings in song. To the
squirrels she may have seemed an ordinary girl clothed in a
green-checked gingham dress, with reddish-brown curls twisted up
into a snood, but the squirrels were not seeing correctly. For
Abbie knew that she had a dark velvet dress that swept around her
feet, a string of pearls on her neck, and in her hand a hat with
a sweeping plume. She was holding it carelessly at her side with
her long, slender fingers that tapered at the ends.</p>
<p>At the top of the knoll she turned. A sea of white faces
looked up at her. To the casual observer it might have seemed a
mass of wild plum-blossoms. Even before she sang, the audience
applauded vociferously and a few people stood up. An onlooker,
who was not magic-eyed, might have thought the wind merely blew
the blossoms. Abbie bowed, smiled,--waited for her accompaniment
to begin. She fingered her pearls, and smiled at the girl at the
reed-organ. All at once she realized that the girl at the organ
was a talented orphan whom she had been befriending. It made her
feel happy, light-hearted. She threw back her head and began
singing:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh! the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,<br>
Beautiful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The song embodied for her all the enchantment of the Arabian
Nights. It opened a door to a magic castle. It smelled of perfume
and spices. It stood for wonderful things in life to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Many a wooer sought her hand,<br>
For she had gold and she had land,"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Her voice rose melodiously high and sweet and true.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Everything at her command,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Her heart seemed bursting with love of the trees, the sky, the
melody.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>There seemed a gleam ahead of her,--a light that beckoned,--a
little will-o'-the-wisp out there beyond the settlement in the
Big Woods. It was something no one knew about,--Mother nor Mary
nor Belle. Only for her it shone,--for her, and other lovely
ladies.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Fanciful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>When the song had died away and Abbie was bowing to the
invisible audience, she heard it, "Abbie, . . . oh, Abbie . . .
hoo-hoo!" Mary's voice was calling and crying in the distance.
She slipped out of the clearing, climbed the stake-and-rider
fence, and saw Mary coming,--calling and crying and coming toward
her. "Abbie, they've just got word out from Dubuque that Fort
Sumter was fired on."</p>
<p>Abbie clutched her. "What, . . . what does <i>that</i> mean,
Mary?"</p>
<p>"It means, . . ." Mary's voice whispered it hoarsely, "Grandpa
Deal says it means <i>war."</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c05" id="c05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, it meant war, with James leaving at the first call, and
Belle's young husband enlisting without her knowing his
intentions. Abbie thought she could not stand it to see them go.
It seemed that life was doing something to her which she could
not countenance. She had a queer sensation of wind blowing past
her,--of wind that she could not stop. She stood in front of the
Seth Thomas clock on the shelf in her mother's cabin and watched
the hands moving above the little brown church painted on the
glass of the door. <i>Oh, stop Time for a few minutes until we
can do something about the war.</i></p>
<p>But the winds blew past, and the clock hands went around, and
James and Belle's husband and several of the neighbor boys had
gone to war.</p>
<p>And by 1862, when Lincoln's call for additional volunteers
came, Dennie, who was nineteen now, went into the Cedar Falls
Reserves, a group of one hundred stalwart fellows. And Abbie
again went all through the torn emotions of parting with Dennie
and hating war.</p>
<p>And then she learned that there was one thing worse than going
to war. And that was not going to war. Will Deal told her so. To
be twenty-one and able-bodied, and see the Reserves entrain and
not go! He was ashamed, and miserable. But his father, with his
one arm, and in the Assembly as he was,--and no one to farm,--and
Regina and Louise and his mother all depending on him,--he could
not go. It seemed queer that of all the people in the community,
Abbie Mackenzie, who was only sixteen, should be the one in whom
Will Deal confided. And because Will Deal had done this, Abbie
told him some things she had never told a soul,--that some day
she was going to be a big person. She could feel it in her,--that
she was going to do great things, sing before vast audiences, and
paint lovely pictures in frames and write things in a book.</p>
<p>"You know, Will, I don't want people to laugh at me,--and I
don't believe you would. But sometimes it all comes over me, that
I can do these big things. It's ahead of me, . . . kind-of like a
light in the woods that shines and stays far away. And when I
read verses, . . . or hear music, . . . or sing, . . . it beckons
me on, . . . and my throat hurts with wanting to do something
great."</p>
<p>Will did not laugh at her, but instead, looked at her queerly
for a moment, noticing for the first time that her skin was as
creamy-white as the May-flowers that grew in the Big Woods, that
her lips were of deep red tints and her eyes of deep brown ones,
and that her mop of curly hair held them both,--the reds and the
browns.</p>
<p>And then, the next year, Ed Matthews, who had been east to
college, was drafted. And Doc Matthews called Will out of the
field where he was cutting wheat with a cradle, and told him he
would give him five hundred dollars to go in Ed's place.</p>
<p>Will walked to the house, laid the sack of gold pieces in his
mother's lap and said, "I'm going, Mother. There's the money to
hire the work done."</p>
<p>He left from the new Dubuque and Sioux City station two miles
from his father's place. Grandpa Deal was there, sick at heart,
joking the boys. Grandma Deal, in her black cap tied under her
wrinkled face, was there, scolding that Will was going, that the
coach would be crowded,--scolding and sputtering in her little
nagging way. Why didn't they stand back? Why didn't they go
to-morrow? What made every one so noisy? Maggie O'Conner
Mackenzie, in her white cap tied under her plump, placid face,
was there. And Abbie Mackenzie, in a sprigged delaine over hoop
skirts, and with a little pancake flowered hat tipped over her
forehead, was there. <i>Oh, God, stop the wind blowing
by,</i>--<i>the wind that blows Time away. Stop the clock hands
until I can think whether Will Deal ought to go to war.</i></p>
<p>And then, something happened. The train was ready to start.
There were good-bys and noise and tears and confusion. Will Deal
shook his father's one hand, and kissed his mother's little
wrinkled cheeks and Regina and Louise,--and started to shake
hands with Abbie Mackenzie, but suddenly kissed her instead. And
if battles have been lost and kingdoms have fallen over less, who
is there to blame Abbie Mackenzie, that her own little kingdom
was in a state of revolution when she left the station and drove
home in the lumber-wagon across the prairie and over the damp,
dark river road?</p>
<p>In the fall of '64, when she was seventeen, Abbie herself was
teaching the home school,--in a new white schoolhouse with green
blinds, but standing in the same spot where the hazel-brush grew
in tangled masses down toward the river bank. There was only one
big boy in school that autumn, a harmless unfortunate, whom
Grandpa Deal termed a "three-quarters wit." The others were "with
Sherman." And Sherman was before Atlanta.</p>
<p>Abbie's thoughts seemed always with them, those boys in shabby
blue: James and Dennie and all the old neighborhood schoolmates.
Through the monotonously droning reading of the McGuffey readers,
the ciphering and the cramped copybook work, she thought of them.
"God bring them all safe home. Please bring them home, God, . . .
James and Dennie and Will Deal." There were other friends and
schoolmates, but no one so big and fine and clean as Will Deal,
and so understanding. Whenever she craved understanding, she
always thought of Will Deal, who did not laugh at her fancies,
but gave her sympathy instead.</p>
<p>Ed Matthews, who had paid his way out of the draft, came home
that fall for a few days. Ed was going to be a doctor like his
father. Several times he had stopped his horse at the schoolhouse
door and, with the reins over his arm, talked to Abbie. She was a
little proud of the attention. It was rather complimentary to be
singled out from all the girls in the neighborhood for attention
from Ed. She could not quite make up her mind whether she really
liked Ed or not. Will Deal didn't like him,--had never liked him.
But Will was prejudiced. And it was nice to see a young man dress
as Ed did. In his riding outfit he certainly looked tony. There
were some rumors around about Ed,--something about his drinking
at times, and riding at dusk down a by-road which decent people
avoided,--but no one had verified them, so far as Abbie knew,
and, anyway, people were probably jealous of him and his
opportunities.</p>
<p>In that week of October on a Friday afternoon, when the
hazel-brush was as brown-burnished as Abbie's hair, and the Big
Woods a mass of scarlet and bronze and crimson, she closed the
schoolhouse and left for home.</p>
<p>In the distance she could see the new, stylish, high-top buggy
of Doctor Matthews going down the lane road where the
honey-locusts, yellow now, bordered the north side of the Deal
place. She was thinking that she could have ridden home with the
doctor if she had been out a little earlier. Not that she cared,
for it was pleasant walking. Who could believe that the guns of
the war were booming in the South this Indian summer day? When
nearly home she paused, turned abruptly, and climbing the
stake-and-rider fence, walked through the oaks into the clearing
where the October sun flecked down through leaf shadows. Not for
several years had she visited the old grassy knoll between the
huge trees. She went up to the top of the knoll now and faced an
invisible audience in that old intangible dream which she always
had with her. Half amused at her own childishness, half earnest
in her actions, there in the seclusion of the woods, she unloosed
from its binding ribbons the reddish-brown mass of her hair. She
unbuttoned the top buttons of her lavender-sprigged delaine dress
and pulled it down over the creamy whiteness of her shoulders,
tucking in the edges to hold it. Then, with her reddish-bronze
hair, with its overtones of gold, framing the Mayflower petals of
her skin, and with her warm brown eyes half closed, Abbie
Mackenzie threw back her head and sang:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,<br>
Beautiful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The notes rose like the nuptial flight of birds, notes of
desire and a longing for their fulfillment.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"To her bower at last there came,<br>
A youthful knight of noble name,<br>
Hand and heart in hope to claim<br>
And in love fell she."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>They throbbed with the joy of life and the pathos of it, with
the beauty of peace and the sadness of war.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Still she put his suit aside,<br>
So he left her in her pride,<br>
And broken-hearted drooped and died,<br>
The Lady--"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>A twig snapped and the note snapped with it. Frightened, Abbie
whirled to the sound. Ed Matthews stood near her, his blond face
aflame. Abbie gave a startled cry, and in fright and
embarrassment, clutched the neck of her gown. But Ed Matthews had
her in his arms, was kissing her full red lips and the creamy
Mayflower petals of her neck, burying his flushed face in the
red-bronze of her hair.</p>
<p>"Abbie, . . . Abbie, . . . you coquette! . . . You're
wonderful, . . . gorgeous. I love you. I never knew . . . I want
you. . . . You're going with me. . . . You'll marry me. . . .
I'll take you east . . . to New York. . . . Your voice . . . I
didn't realize . . . You can have the best teachers . . . I have
to go back to-morrow . . . Abbie . . . you <i>coquette . . .
!</i> And we have to-night left . . . tonight is ours . . ."</p>
<p>Swept away on the tide of Ed's passionate words, she seemed to
be without thought or comprehension. When she could speak, she
found herself saying almost without her own volition, "Don't, Ed,
don't <i>touch</i> me. You've no right. <i>You've no right."</i>
She was trying to button the high neck of her dress, pushing Ed's
protesting hand away, twisting up the red-brown curls of her
hair. Ed's laughter disconcerted and frightened her. He seemed so
very sure of himself,--and of her.</p>
<p>It was sundown when they reached the Mackenzie cabin. For a
long time they stood in front of it, talking. Ed's flushed face
bent to Abbie's.</p>
<p>"I <i>think</i> so, Ed, . . . but I'm not sure. It's sudden
and, . . . when you come in the spring I'll know my own
mind."</p>
<p>"You're playing with me. You <i>are</i> a coquette."</p>
<p>"No, Ed, . . . I'm <i>really</i> uncertain."</p>
<p>"Uncertain about marrying me?" Ed's opinion of himself was not
what one would term feeble. "Uncertain about going to New York, .
. . with <i>that</i> voice? . . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, Ed, <i>if</i> I went, . . ." Abbie was suddenly childish,
wistful, "would I be a lovely lady?"</p>
<p>Ed Matthews' banter and his high-handedness were stilled, his
passion and his ardor quieted. He bent and kissed Abbie's pretty
tapering hand. "You would be a lovely lady," he said gently.</p>
<p>When he had gone, Mary and Mother Mackenzie drew Abbie in to
tell them what it was all about.</p>
<p>Importuned to secrecy, Mary was excited beyond the completion
of sentences. "Abbie . . . <i>you . . .</i> Doctor Ed Matthews .
. . to go to New York . . . your voice . . . teachers in New York
. . . it might be in the opera . . ."</p>
<p>Mother Mackenzie asked gravely, "Do you <i>love</i> him,
acushla?"</p>
<p>Abbie turned burning cheeks to her Irish mother and clutched
her plump shoulders. "I don't know. Tell me, mother, what
<i>is</i> love?"</p>
<p>"That," said Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie, "I canna tell ye. An'
no one can tell ye. Sure, an' I mind an' I knew it though,
mysel'. I look for you to know it, yoursel', Abbie."</p>
<p>Abbie went up to her loft room. She wanted to be alone. Love?
Was this love? To be able to go to New York and study? Her voice
. . . a new world . . . the world of courtly men and lovely
ladies . . . of silken shawls . . . of strings of pearls . . . of
flowing plumes. But that world also held Ed Matthews with his
eyes that were not quite steady, with his disconcerting laugh and
the vague, unproven rumors. But he loved her, that was certain.
Or . . . was it so certain? His kisses . . . Abbie's face burned
with the memory. She thought of Will Deal and the day he had left
for war two years before. Will had kissed her, too--</p>
<p>Quite suddenly she wished she could talk the whole thing over
with Will Deal. Will would help her know her own mind,--help her
understand what love was. Of all the people she knew in the whole
world, Will was the most understanding. He was so steady,--so
dependable. "Oh God, bring Will Deal safe home soon to help me
know."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c06" id="c06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And then the presidential campaign of '64 was on in full
swing. Over in town there were parades and banners and
torchlights and much bombastic oratory. General Sherman was close
upon Atlanta and Grandpa Deal was close upon General Sherman. For
he had been delegated by Governor Kirkwood to go to the first
division of General Logan's Fifteenth Army Corps to bring the
vote of the Iowa contingent back to the state. Many weeks elapsed
before his return. Atlanta fell. All communication to the north
was severed, for General Sherman had started on his wearisome
march to the sea. And with the tramping columns rode Grandpa Deal
on a horse whose mane was as black as Grandpa Deal's own bushy
head. A veritable old man of the sea he looked upon his return,
grotesque appearing, with the bag of ballots swung over his
shoulder by a strap, a faded carpet-bag in his one hand,--in the
bag the government's pay to many of the Iowa boys.</p>
<p>Abbie was "boarding around," and was at the Deal house for the
week when Grandpa came. He told his experiences to the family in
high glee, his ice-blue eyes twinkling behind the bushy brows.
"I'd al'a's throw the old bag down," he would relate with silent
chuckles, "'n' give it a kick for extra measure, so's nobody'd
allow the' was any value to it,--'n' all the time the' was two
thousand four hundred and twenty-two dollars in its old
insides."</p>
<p>"Did you," Abbie moistened dry red lips, "did you--happen to
see Will?"</p>
<p>The chuckles died. Yes, he had seen Will, had in fact kept as
close to Company B, 31st Iowa Regiment as he consistently could.
He had tried to make Will ride the horse a few times when he was
exhausted. He had sat around the campfire with him a few nights,
when the boys sang and joked and told stories to keep up their
spirits. "Was the awfulest dense pitch-pine smoke from them
camp-fires ye'd ever see. Boys used to kinda apologize to me
about 'em, bein' as how I was a sort o' guest on the march. But
I'd al'a's tell 'em black smoke didn't interfere much with my
complexion."</p>
<p>In a few minutes he said soberly: "Will's been caught
stealin'."</p>
<p>"Stealing?" A sharp pang of apprehension went through Abbie.
She and Grandma Deal turned to each other in mutual fright.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, . . . stealin'." Grandpa Deal's forehead was
puckered in agony.</p>
<p>"My boy stole?" Grandma's little worried face took on an added
anxiety.</p>
<p>"'Twas at Savannah. Provisions was one ear of corn to the man.
There was transports layin' right out there in sight off the
coast with food on for our boys. Couldn't get in 'til
fortifications fell. 'N' then my boy . . ." His voice shook in
mock sorrow. "My boy went to the corral," the eyes began to
twinkle, "'n' stole two ears of corn from some army mules 'n'
boiled the corn for supper."</p>
<p>Grandma was provoked. "You ain't got no call to be scarin' me
that way," she sputtered. "You ain't got no call to spend your
life jokin'."</p>
<p>"Oh, come, now, Ma. Better to laugh than to cry. Will maybe'll
be remorse-stricken all the days o' his life,--to hear the
brayin' in his conscience of them poor, helpless, skinny,
mouse-colored government mules."</p>
<p>When Abbie was starting for school, Grandpa casually followed
her out. "Had a good visit with Will." He cocked one eye up at
the well-sweep.</p>
<p>"Did you?"</p>
<p>"Yep. He wanted to know how all the Iowa folks was."</p>
<p>"Did he?"</p>
<p>"Yep. More specifically, he wanted to know how all the
Blackhawk folks was."</p>
<p>"Did he?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Collectively, he wanted to know how all the folks in our
community was."</p>
<p>"Did he?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Individually, he wanted to know how <i>you</i> was."</p>
<p>"Oh, . . . did he?"</p>
<p>"Yep. He says to me," . . . Grandpa carelessly picked up a
handful of snow and threw it at a rooster. "If I can rec'lect his
words exact, they was, 'How's my Abbie-girl'?"</p>
<p>Abbie walked over the crusted snow in a maze of conflicting
emotions,--behind the hard little stays of her waist a burning
letter from Ed Matthews and plans for her future,--in her heart,
the memory of Will Deal's one kiss, more poignant than
either.</p>
<p>A new minister and his wife came to the growing town that fall
and made a round of calls among the country folk. They were
Vermont people. The Reverend Ezra Whitman was dignified, pompous,
a little pedantic. Mrs. Whitman was refined, soft-spoken, a
graduate of a girls' seminary. She took a great interest in
Abbie, so that the young teacher began going into town to see
her. She found that Mrs. Whitman was something of an artist. The
little new frame house in which the couple lived held several oil
paintings that seemed the acme of art to Abbie, and there was
always an unfinished canvas on an easel. The paints fascinated
the girl. She longed to get her hands on them. Something in her
eyes must have flashed its unspoken message, for one day Mrs.
Whitman asked her if she would like to try her hand with the
brush. It thrilled her beyond words. Crudely enough, but with
some intuitive knowledge, she did a little clump of trees on a
piece of waste canvas.</p>
<p>"I'll never be satisfied until I can do it well," she said.
From that time on, at Mrs. Whitman's invitation, she began
painting with her, riding over to town when she could, tramping
the two and one-half miles through slush or mud when there was no
other way to go.</p>
<p>"It's your voice, though, that shows the greater promise,"
Mrs. Whitman told her. "I wish I could help you with that, too.
Mr. Whitman's sister will know what to tell you when she comes.
She teaches voice in my old seminary."</p>
<p>And when the sister came, and heard Abbie, she was
enthusiastic. "It's good," she told them all. "It's more than
good. It's splendid. You can do really big things with it. You
must try sometime to come East for lessons."</p>
<p>But Abbie was too bashful to tell her that already she had an
opportunity to go to New York to study. Her praise had its
influence in Abbie's decision. If her voice was really as good as
Mrs. Whitman thought--And so, on the day in April that Lee
surrendered, Abbie Mackenzie surrendered, too. She wrote the
letter to Ed Matthews that she would marry him. When she had sent
it over to town to be mailed she went to her old grassy knoll in
the clearing to sing. But she did not seem to sing well.
Something seemed lacking. The melody sounded flat, unlovely, like
a song from which the soul had fled.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed, Abbie felt restless, nervous and a
little sad. She told herself that it was on account of Lincoln's
assassination. And indeed, some of it was, for the whole
settlement mourned. But not all of her mood was due to the
President's tragic death.</p>
<p>On a day in May, with the honey-locusts all in bloom, she
stood at the door of the schoolhouse, and watched the train from
the east shriek its way across Grandpa Deal's newly planted
corn-fields. She washed her blackboard, set her desk to rights,
locked the schoolhouse, and started home. And, quite suddenly,
she saw some one coming down the lane. Abbie stood still, her
heart pounding tumultuously with the uncertainty of the figure's
identity. The world was a lovely painting of sunshine, blue
skies, honey-locusts, bees on the blossoms,--a palpitating,
throbbing world of spring.</p>
<p>Will Deal in his blue soldier's suit was coming toward her.
She could not take her eyes from his face. He was smiling,
questioningly, a little quizzically, and with something that was
infinitely more tender. He slipped the knapsack from his back and
held out his arms. Swiftly, lightly, Abbie went to him.</p>
<p>"Oh, Will, don't let me, . . . don't let me do it," Abbie
began sobbing a little wildly, almost hysterically. For two years
Abbie Mackenzie had not shed a tear and now she was crying wildly
in Will Deal's arms. Will held her close, smoothed her hair back
from her creamy-white forehead.</p>
<p>"Do what, Abbie-girl?" He was all gentleness, all desirous of
understanding.</p>
<p>"Marry Ed Matthews."</p>
<p>Will caught her fiercely, held her closer, kissed her red
lips, laid his face to her cheek that was like Mayflower petals.
And Abbie thought of ships that come home to the harbor.</p>
<p>"I should say I won't. He could buy me in the draft . . . but
he can't buy my Abbie."</p>
<p>"I was afraid all the time, Will."</p>
<p>Will held her close,--smoothed her red-brown hair.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what, Abbie-girl?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Just afraid."</p>
<p>"You're not afraid with me?"</p>
<p>"Not with you, Will. Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you and you love me."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it . . . and I'm not afraid."</p>
<p>"Of life with me, Abbie-girl?"</p>
<p>"Not of anything, Will, with you."</p>
<p>"And you'll always love me?"</p>
<p>"Always, Will, . . . in this life and the next,"</p>
<p>The afternoon sun rays lengthened across the fields. The
honey-locusts dropped in the lane. The bees made noisy forages
into the hearts of the blossoms. Will and Abbie lingered, all the
melody of life a-tune, all the heaven that they desired, there in
the lane under the honey-locusts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c07" id="c07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>They were married on a winter's day of 1865, when Abbie was
not quite nineteen and Will was twenty-three. The day was mild,
even warm, a phenomenon for that time of year. "A
weather-breeder," every one called it. A few men shed their coats
and worked in their shirtsleeves during the middle of the day, so
that they might tell of it in years to come.</p>
<p>Maggie Mackenzie and Abbie and Mary set the furniture out of
the log house, so there would be room for the guests. Janet's two
children were designated as a committee to keep the chickens off
the various pieces, but so excited were the youngsters over the
elaborate culinary preparations, that during a period of the
abandonment of their posts, an old hen flew up on top of the high
boy and laid an egg in the work-basket.</p>
<p>Abbie had made two new dresses from cloth sent out from
Chicago. One was a wine-colored merino, the other a brown alpaca,
both made fashionably full over hoop-skirts, with panniers at the
side. A new little hat, the shape of a butter-bowl, with ribbon
bows on it, added much to her pride.</p>
<p>Toward evening of the great day, Abbie was all of a-flutter
because there were so many things to do. There was still water to
be heated in a boiler on the stove and the wash-tub to be brought
in for her bath. She had to skim a pan of milk, so that she could
make the skin of her face and hands soft with cream. And she
nearly forgot the flour she was to brown in the oven with which
to powder her body. Basil, fifteen now, helped take the hot water
on its perilous journey up the loft ladder with the saplings
nailed across for steps, and lifted up the wooden tub on his
strong young shoulder.</p>
<p>In spite of the unusually warm day, it was a little chilly for
one's ablutions in the loft room, but Abbie was young and
vigorous and used to it. She put on her muslin chemise and
pantalets and her tight little stays, holding her breath until
she could lace them so that her two hands could almost span her
waist. Into her bosom she slipped a little netting sack of dried
rose petals, which smelled faintly and tantalizingly of by-gone
Junes. Then over her head she dropped and fastened the long
collapsible hoop-skirt, with its nineteen bands of white covered
wires. There were three white muslin petticoats, starched almost
to chinaware stiffness and ruffled to the knees. Abbie and her
mother had hemmed seventy-two yards of ruffles by hand. Grandma
Deal had one of the Howe stitching machines, but not all families
could afford one. Then, at last, she put on her wine-colored
merino with its countless rows of flutings of the same material
and side panniers.</p>
<p>She was patting her hair into place and pulling out the long
shoulder curl, when her mother came puffingly, slowly, up the
loft ladder. Mother was getting old now. She was
forty-seven,--heavy and placid. Her fat round face in its white
cap with strings tied under her two chins, appeared in the loft
opening. Abbie went over to her and took her hand, so that she
would not fall. She saw that her mother had the calf-skin covered
box in her hand.</p>
<p>It was several moments before Maggie Mackenzie could talk,
puffingly, after the climb. "Abbie, I want ye to have the pearls.
I'm savin' the fan for Mary. Janet has the breast-pin, you know,
and Belle the shawl. Belle always stuck 'n' hung fer the shawl.
And the pearls are fer you. Ye'll ne'er starve as long as ye have
'em." She opened the little hairy-skinned chest and took out a
small velvet box and from it the pearls themselves. She twined
them through her short stubby fingers, their creamy shimmer
incongruous in the plump peasant hand. "They were Basil's fine
mother's. After she died, . . . Basil gave 'em to me in the days
of wealth. Sure, but it wasn't the wealth that brought us
happiness. Many's the time I've hated it . . . longin' for a
little house somewhere, . . . out of the wind 'n' rain, . . . 'n'
not many things at all, at all. . . ."</p>
<p>There were tears in Abbie's brown eyes when she took them. She
held their creamy luster in the palm of her firm young hand. Into
her mind came that old admiration for Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie.
The touch of the jewels seemed to bring her near, to call up the
vision of the lovely lady who was wearing them in the wide gold
frame,--the lovely lady with the sweeping velvet and the long
flowing plume and the fingers that tapered at the ends. Some day
she was going to be like her. Some day she, too, would be lovely
and gracious and wealthy. All of life was before her. All the
future was hers. And that future now held Will, with his steady
gray eyes,--Will Deal who was like a quiet harbor. Song, soft and
meltingly tender came to her lips:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She held the pearls up to the wine-colored merino and looked
in the small oblong glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Beautiful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Then she turned to her mother. Her face was flushed, tender.
"Thank you, Mother, . . . so much, . . . I'll keep them always.
But with the dark dress and the high neck, . . . I'll just not
wear them to-night. After awhile when Will and I are wealthy,
I'll wear them. And maybe we'll have, . . ." Some reticences
existing at the time, the blood swept Abbie's face, ". . . maybe
we'll have a daughter some day and <i>she</i> can wear them on
her wedding night, . . . in white satin . . . and all the things
that go with it . . ."</p>
<p>Abbie swept across the dingy loft room, her hoops swinging in
wiry bounces. She knelt down by her mother's chair, her skirts
forming a huge circular mound, and laid her head against the
older woman's. "And besides, Mother, <i>you</i> understand, don't
you . . . when you follow your heart you don't need <i>pearls</i>
to make you happy?"</p>
<p>It was time now. Abbie went down the ladder with the saplings
nailed across for steps. She had to go backward so that her hoops
could navigate the descension with some degree of modesty. The
fiddlers were playing, "The Girl I Left Behind Me." Will, looking
big and fine and handsome, was there in the black suit Grandma
Deal had made him. Grandpa Deal, with his one arm and the kindly
twinkle in his ice-blue eyes, was there,--joking. Grandma Deal,
in a black cap with black strings tied under the face that was
covered with the faint tracing of hosts of wrinkles, was there.
She was nervous, fretful, scolding. Why didn't the men stand
back? Why didn't they shut that door? Where was that preacher
keeping himself? A thousand mental worries like a thousand gnats
irritating the peace of her mind. Whole families had come in
wagons. Regina Deal and her beau and Dr. and Mrs. Matthews were
the only ones who had come in high-top buggies. When the doctor
and his wife came in, there was a little buzz of excitement, some
whispering that they wondered whether or not it was true that
young Dr. Ed had wanted Abbie.</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell on the company.</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as we are gathered here together in the sight of the
Lord." Suddenly, Abbie wanted to halt the ceremony. There seemed
nothing in her mind but that odd thought of a wind rushing by, a
wind she could not stop,--Time, going by,--Time which she could
not stay. Stop Time for a minute, until she could think what
queer thing was happening to her.</p>
<p>"Do you take this woman, . . . sickness, . . . health, . . .
'til death, . . ." What a queer thing to talk about
now,--death,--when it was life that was before them. ". . . this
man . . . lawfully wedded husband . . . ?"</p>
<p>"I do." <i>But, oh Will . . . . Will . . . who are you? Do I
know you?</i></p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, Abbie Mackenzie was Abbie Deal. The
fiddlers played "Money Musk," and "Turkey in the Straw." The
company danced,--square dances of intricate design. Grandpa Deal
wanted to take a partner, but Grandma Deal said no, it was
foolish for an old man, fifty-five. But Maggie O'Conner Mackenzie
danced,--alone, lightly and puffingly, in the middle of the
floor, to:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh the days of the Kerry dancing,<br>
Oh the days when my heart was young."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>There were biscuits and chickens and cakes and cider to be
eaten from tables formed by putting long boards over saw-horses.
And then, more dancing.</p>
<p>Will Deal's dark serious face bent low above Abbie's
creamy-petaled, flushed one. A long row of love-apples stood in
the window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c08" id="c08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Will and Abbie drove to Grandpa Deal's in a two-wheeled cart
behind an old white mare. So slowly did they drive that several
passed them on the river road,--Grandpa and Grandma Deal and
Louise in a lumber-wagon with a fine big team, and Regina Deal
and her beau in the new high-top buggy. Grandpa laughed and
called out some saucy jokes, but Grandma told him to hush his
foolishness and 'tend to his driving.</p>
<p>Will and Abbie had the front bedroom of the big five-roomed
log-house for their own. In the weeks that followed, Will went
about the regular farm work for his father, and Abbie put her
young shoulder to the wheel of the housework. For Will's sake she
tried to meet his mother's petty nagging with forbearance. But it
wore on her like the constant dripping of water on a stone.
Grandma Deal was a chronic grumbler and a born pessimist. She saw
bad signs in Nature's most ordinary activities. If a dog ate
grass, if a bird flew through the house, if the moon rose from a
cloud, the direst things were about to happen. And life meant
nothing to her, apparently, but work. The first break of day and
the last ray of sunlight saw her at the hard tasks of the
housework. And when all other duties seemed done, she immediately
brought out a box of intricate quilt blocks, The Rose of Sharon
and The Star of Bethlehem, The Rising Sun or the Log Cabin. For
Grandpa Deal, Abbie had nothing but love. His Yankee drollness
could always bring a bubbling laugh to her lips and his stump of
an arm gave her added tenderness toward him. Looking at the two,
she used to wonder how he could keep so cheerful. He never
crossed Grandma, never argued with her in any way but jovially,
never lost his temper. "Now, Mother," he would say, "can't you
see the funny side of that?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't," she would retort, "and neither could you if
you'd stop your foolish jokin' and keep your mind on your
work."</p>
<p>It never went into a quarrel. When it approached one, Grandpa
would go whistling out to the barn to work. Yes, Abbie loved
Will's father better than his mother. In the same way did she
enjoy and dislike Louise and Regina. Louise was energetic,
pleasant, peace-loving. Regina was selfish, a mischief-maker and
a shirk. The young farmer with whom Regina was now keeping
company had come first to see Louise. Although Abbie knew little
of the circumstances, she felt quite definitely sure that Regina
had maneuvered the transposition with adroitness.</p>
<p>All spring, Abbie, fearful that the family might think she was
not doing her part, took more than her share of the household
duties. She helped boil the maple sap down into sugar, swept and
dusted, baked and cooked, and took over the entire care of the
chickens. Louise worked with her faithfully, but Regina slipped
out from under the tasks with all the agility of an eel.</p>
<p>And then Abbie was not well, . . .</p>
<p>"She's not doing her share," Abbie overheard Grandma's
sputtering. "I told you it was too good to be true. I said all
the time it wouldn't last."</p>
<p>"Now, Mother," Grandpa's voice came gently, patiently, "I
think I know what's the matter. You wouldn't want her to
overdo."</p>
<p>"Overdo, nothing. I brought eight babies into the world. And I
ain't ever seen the time anybody cared if <i>I</i> was
overdoin'."</p>
<p>"Now, Mother, I wouldn't say that. It was hard, but you was
healthy and I always got help for you."</p>
<p>"Yes, a passel o' neighbor girls that wasn't worth their
weight in salt. Now, I s'pose it'll fall on me to take care o'
Abbie. Nobody cares if I die or not."</p>
<p>Abbie heard Grandpa go whistling down to the barn. Then she
threw herself on the bed and cried tears of sensitiveness and
discontent.</p>
<p>More and more she wanted her own home. If it were no better
than the old sheep shed that she lived in one summer when she was
a little girl, at least it would be their own. Will was good to
her,--so kind and understanding, but he did not seem to sense how
much she wanted a home of her own.</p>
<p>Abbie's baby was born in January of 1867. Roads were drifted
and Doc Matthews, in a coonskin cap with the tail down his back,
came on a horse, his saddle-bags full of quinine and calomel.</p>
<p>Nature had to take its course without much aid from its
handmaid, Science--and Nature took a fiendish course with Abbie.
Two days and a night she wrestled with Nature, as Jacob wrestled
with the angel. And then she had a son. Lying there after her
ordeal, with the baby on her arm, she knew the age-old surge of
mother-love. All her old love of life seemed to concentrate on
one thing,--the little soft, helpless bundle. The world of
romance, of courtly men and lovely ladies was a world of
unreality,--and only Will and the little son were worth her
thoughts.</p>
<p>Mackenzie Deal, they named him, but it was too big a mouthful
for so small a bit of humanity, and it was not long until every
one had shortened it to Mack. Will was inordinately proud of him.
Grandpa Deal and Louise came in several times a day to see him,
but Regina was not overly interested. Grandma Deal sputtered
about the care of him. Why didn't Abbie keep more shawls around
him? Why did she let the sun shine across the bed that way? Why
did she ask the doctor all those questions when he didn't know as
much about babies as a mother?</p>
<p>When Abbie was up, life grew richer, more full. Her voice took
on a mellowness. With the baby in the high-backed wooden rocker,
she crooned old lullabies which Maggie O'Conner had brought from
the whins of Bally-poreen.</p>
<p>As little Mack grew that year and crept and then stood on fat
wobbling legs by the chairs, Abbie's desire for a home of her own
reached gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>"You know, Will," she brought up the subject in the spring, a
little shyly, half hesitatingly, "I wish we could have a home of
our own. Your folks . . ." She dropped her eyes that Will might
not see the telltale evasion in them,--"are good to me, but I'd
so like my own little house. It needn't be half as big . . . or
nice . . ."</p>
<p>To Abbie's surprise Will turned on her in a sort of suppressed
fury. "I don't like it either, you needn't think. I'm thinking
every day what to do. What am I here? A hired man for Father.
I'll never get anywhere. And now we've got the baby . . . I'm
glad you've been the one to bring it up. It decides me. We're
going out to Nebraska to start for ourselves."</p>
<p><i>"Nebraska?"</i> It had the sound of South Africa.</p>
<p>"Yes, . . . there are too many settlers here. And as long as
I'm anywhere around here I'd always have to work for Father. It
ain't right, I tell you. And another thing, Abbie, our boy
sha'n't be tied down. He can do what he wants. And we're going to
Nebraska,--you and I and little Mack."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Will, not out there. Anywhere around here, but not to
that far-off place. Why, Will, . . . my mother . . . my brothers
and sisters . . . your folks . . . they're <i>all</i> around here
. . ."</p>
<p>"You can come back to visit them, I promise you that, Abbie,
whenever you want to. It's a wonderful opportunity. It's the poor
man's country. We can get railroad land dirt cheap . . . or lease
school lands near the river or even push on farther west and
homestead."</p>
<p>"It's dangerous, Will. There are Indians."</p>
<p>"Well, so are there Indians here. A whole camp of 'em over by
Fisher's Lake."</p>
<p>"But they're peaceable, . . . and those out there . . . Oh,
Will . . ."</p>
<p>"It's been fourteen years since the government made the treaty
with the Indians out there . . . fourteen years ago, they gave up
their title to all that land out there bordering on the Missouri.
I guess when it's been that long settling, we'll find it in
pretty good shape. . . ." Will was talking definitely,
stubbornly, as though the question were settled. Abbie was so
frightened at the turn the argument was taking that she
studiously kept her voice calm.</p>
<p>"The baby, Will, . . . we have to think of him. There won't be
good schools . . . or doctors . . ."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> of him I'm thinking . . . the big future for him
out in the newer country. He'll be a farmer. All the Deals have
always been for the land. . . ."</p>
<p>Fathers have always thought it,--that their sons belong only
to them. Small wonder that Will Deal made the mistake of
forgetting something, forgetting that the baby was also a
Mackenzie, that his mother held her head as Isabelle
Anders-Mackenzie had held hers in the wide gold frame,--that her
hair had the gold-brown tints of the lovely lady,--that her long
slender fingers tapered at the ends.</p>
<p>"But, Will . . ." Never had Abbie so thoroughly felt that
queer sensation of being swept along by the wind which she could
not stop,--of Time, which she could not stay. "Will . . . my
voice . . . Mrs. Whitman . . . Every one thinks I ought to do
something with it. And my painting, Will . . . to go away out
there . . ."</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll find you good teachers out there. No, Abbie, I've
been thinking it over a long time and it's my chance. We're going
in the summer. I'll be getting everything ready. The army money
will buy the wagon and oxen and the land, . . . and I'll make up
my mind soon about it, . . . whether to buy near the river, or
homestead farther out."</p>
<p>So Will had said he was going West. The era of this freedom
had not dawned. Abbie Deal's man had said he was going to
Nebraska, and Abbie had to go too. It was as simple as that,
then.</p>
<p>They began preparations, with Abbie still protesting that
Nebraska was too far away and too uncivilized.</p>
<p>"It's been a state since March of last year," Will gave equal
arguments in its favor. "They've got the site all chosen for the
new capital. It's named Lincoln. Queer when you stop to think
about it that an old friend of Father's should ever get big
enough to be president and have a town named after him,--ain't
it?"</p>
<p>But Abbie was not thinking of the recently martyred President.
"Yes, but they say the place they've chosen is away out on the
prairie with just two or three log houses." She was not so
willing to believe the best of the infant state as was Will.</p>
<p>He sought out all the good news he could find to cheer her.
Once he brought an Omaha newspaper. "Talk about a new country, .
. ." he was enthusiastic. "Everything's as citified as can be in
Omaha, . . . and we won't be so far from there. The paper says it
has fifteen thousand inhabitants, . . . a regular city. How's
this for you, eleven churches and five schools, and five banks.
It says, 'Dealers in gold dust, bullion, coin and exchange.' And
the Union Pacific's got an overland mail route clear to Laramie,
with two trains every day."</p>
<p>"Yes, and you read on a little farther. You're leaving out
some things. I saw that paper myself, Will Deal."</p>
<p>Will laughed. "Oh, five breweries and sixty saloons, . . .
that ain't so bad. And besides there's a hoop factory."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't care about that. They might even go out of
style some day, although Regina thinks they never will. I
wouldn't care if they did. Even if they do make you look stylish,
they're not comfortable."</p>
<p>And all the time Abbie was getting together her little
possessions, and Will was preparing the outfit. He had intended
to make a new ox-yoke, had in fact already cut the maple, and
some pliable hickory for the bows, when Mother Mackenzie gave him
the sturdy yoke that she had used fourteen years before on the
trip out from Illinois. He painted the names of his ox team,
"Red" and "Baldy," on it and in the center, "Nebraska, 1868."</p>
<p>After some correspondence with an old army friend, Will bought
his land, "sight unseen." He was pleased with his purchase. It
was railroad land and he paid two dollars an acre for it. Some
people from Michigan by the name of Lutz were getting two
quarter-sections near him.</p>
<p>"It's only thirty-five miles from Nebraska City and about ten
miles from Weeping Water. The county seat, Plattsmouth, has a
hotel and some houses and a grist mill . . . It only takes a
couple of hours to grind a sack of corn."</p>
<p>"Yes, providing you've got the <i>corn.</i>" Abbie could not
yet enter heartily into the plans.</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll have the corn all right. They say the soil is the
finest and blackest you ever saw."</p>
<p>And then, before they were ready, Abbie knew that she was to
be a mother again.</p>
<p>On a morning in July they started. Red and Baldy, in front of
Grandpa Deal's, stood hitched to the prairie-schooner in their
stupid, stolid way. All the possessions were in the wagon,
covered now with its new white canvas. Every one was there to see
them off. Mother Mackenzie, with her pudding-bag-shaped body and
her blue-black Irish eyes and her white cap, brought the
calf-skin-covered box and the Seth Thomas clock with the little
brown church painted on the glass.</p>
<p>"You take the chest, Abbie . . . I want ye to have it. You can
keep the pearls in it. And the clock, too, . . . it seems like
it's yours. I mind how ye was al'a's sayin' no one could stop
Time."</p>
<p>The Reverend and Mrs. Whitman came. Mrs. Whitman had a box of
paints and some canvas for Abbie. "Keep on with your little
painting talent, Abbie," she told her.</p>
<p>"Yes," the Reverend Whitman said, a little pompously, "and
with your music. We can do with our lives whatever we will, you
know."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," agreed Abbie.</p>
<p>Grandma Deal, in her black cap, was sputtering because she had
not had time to put her bread in loaves. Why didn't they tie the
chicken-coop on better? Why hadn't they started the day before?
The weather looked as though it might storm. What did they bother
with a dog for? There, a bird flew in front of the oxen,--that
was a bad sign.</p>
<p>Doctor Matthews stopped in his new top-buggy.</p>
<p>Grandpa Deal's ice-blue eyes were clouded with sadness. "Good
luck to you, my boy. And Abbie, a real daughter couldn't have
been kinder."</p>
<p>Abbie's heart was in her throat. Oh, stop the wind rushing by.
Stop Time for a few minutes, until she could think whether this
move was the thing to do. Life was not right. It was not meant
that you should leave your own this way. It was not meant that
weeks and weeks of travel should separate you from your folks.
The baby, little Mack, would forget Mother Mackenzie and kind old
Grandpa Deal. And the next baby would never know them.</p>
<p>Only one thing gave her strength for the parting. Only one
thing gave her courage to make the long journey to the raw new
state. Her love for Will. Abbie's love for her husband had
retained its sweetness and its ardor. And in her heart she knew
that as much as she cared for her people,--as dear as were her
mother and sisters and the old settlement to her,--they did not
outweigh her love for him. If being with Will meant making a new
home in a far, unsettled country, why, then, she chose to journey
bravely to the far, unsettled country.</p>
<p>Abbie threw up her head fearlessly. "Well, we're ready."</p>
<p>"Good-by . . ."</p>
<p>"Take good care of little Mack."</p>
<p>"Oh, Abbie, Abbie . . ."</p>
<p>"Mother . . . good-by . . ."</p>
<p>"Janet, dear, . . . Mary . . . Belle . . . Louise . . . Thank
you all for all you did . . . Good-by . . . Yes, we'll write as
soon as . . . Kiss Grandma, Mack-baby . . ."</p>
<p>Will was boyishly gay. For the first time he felt free from
"the folks,"--his own master.</p>
<p>"Well, here we go." He cracked the long black snaky-looking
whip. "Well come back rich." He laughed in excitement.</p>
<p>The wagon lurched,--steadied,--moved on.</p>
<p>"Good-by . . . good-by . . . good-by . . ."</p>
<p>Hands were in the air,--a sunbonnet waved,--an apron was
thrown over some one's head. There was sobbing. Abbie's hand was
on her hard, dry throat. It felt as though it must burst. Stop
the wind. Stop Time for a minute. The wagon lurched ahead.</p>
<p>Far back in the road Abbie could still see the little group,
painted flatly against the white of the fence and the green of
the honey-locusts.</p>
<p>Will's eyes, full of the light of hope and courage, looked to
the west. But Abbie's, tear-misted, clung to the east.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c09" id="c09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It was three weeks later, on a hot morning, that Will and
Abbie and the other two families, whose land was to join theirs,
broke camp, twenty miles out of Plattsmouth, where they had
crossed the Platte on the ferry. The journey over western Iowa
had been one endless lurching through acres of dry grass and
sunflowers, thickets of sumac, wild plum and Indian currant. And
now, save for the little clump of natural growth near the wagons,
there was still not a tree in sight, not a shrub nor bush, a
human being nor any living thing,--nothing but the coarse prairie
grass.</p>
<p>The heads of the two Lutz families were brothers, Oscar and
Henry. Oscar had a wife and three small children, Henry, a young
bride and her little six-year-old orphaned nephew. Grandpa Lutz,
a mild-mannered, gentle old man, had also come into the new
country with his sons. They had traveled from Michigan, the two
younger men by wagons, several weeks prior to the others. The
women, children and the old gentleman had gone by train to
Quincy, Illinois, where they had taken a river steamer to
Hannibal, Missouri, crossing the Missouri to St. Joseph and
taking a boat up the Missouri to Plattsmouth. There the men,
having preceded the party, had waited a week for the boat to
appear.</p>
<p>"I'd go down every day and kick the post the boat was goin' to
tie up to," Oscar Lutz was telling Will.</p>
<p>Will laughed. "What for?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. Had to take all the delay out on somethin'
or somebody, so I kicked the post instead o' Henry, here."</p>
<p>Sarah, the bride, was a pretty girl. Her hair was crow-black,
her cheeks pink as prairie roses, her little black beady eyes had
merry wrinkles of laughter around them. Life seemed a joke to
her. This forenoon she had decorated the wagon with Indian paint
brush, which burned like flames of fire against the dingy white
of the canvas cover.</p>
<p>Abbie, in her illness from heat and fatigue and pregnancy,
could only sit and wonder how young Sarah Lutz could be so happy
and active. Nothing seemed to worry or frighten her. Apparently
she had not even been disturbed by the story of the graves at
Eight-Mile Grove,--the seven graves under the little clump of
trees fenced around with slabs which the blacksmith there had
told them were brought from the saw-mill at Rock Bluff. They had
asked him innocently enough who was buried there. Abbie almost
shivered now at the thought of his answer.</p>
<p>"Claim jumpers 'n horse thieves 'n sich," he had said
indifferently. And, shifting his tobacco, had added definitely,
"Hung. Vigilance committee." And more grimly specific, "To that
there tree."</p>
<p>"Hung?" Some one had repeated in the silence that
followed.</p>
<p>"Yep. Hang 'em in summer," he had explained cheerfully, "'n'
poke 'em under the ice in winter."</p>
<p>Abbie shuddered again at the memory of the grim voice.</p>
<p>The journey on from camp was across the vast prairie itself.
As the morning passed, the heat rolled over Abbie in waves like
the rippling of the grass. She looked out from the canvas to see
Will plodding along, his shoulders drooping. He had not called
back any gay cheery thing all forenoon. The grass out
there,--would it never cease to wave? There were four rhythmic
beats like music, but music which irritated rather than soothed
one: <i>Blow . . . wave . . . ripple . . . dip.</i> It beat upon
her brain, so that she turned wearily away from the sight. And
then, as one fascinated by something distasteful, she looked
again. Yes, it never ceased from those four beats: <i>Blow, . . .
wave, . . . ripple, . . . dip, . . . blow . . . wave . . . ripple
. . . dip . . .</i></p>
<p>Little Mack was sleeping, and Abbie dropped over beside him.
She closed her eyes and kept her mind on the lane beside Grandpa
Deal's with the honey-locusts and the maples, on the black walnut
grove back of his house and the hazel-nut thickets around the
schoolhouse. How cool and pleasant the schoolhouse looked with
the green shutters against the white siding! How good it would
seem to draw water from Grandpa Deal's well. In fancy she pulled
up the bucket with the windlass and put her face into its cold,
dark depths.</p>
<p>She slept,--and sleeping, walked in the cool of the maples and
oaks in the Big Woods, picked anemones and creamy white
Mayflowers. She dropped down in a bed of cool ferns behind Janet
Graves' house in the timber. Suddenly, the wagon creaked and
lurched and she opened her eyes. Hurriedly sitting up, only half
cognizant of where she was, she looked out through the canvas.
The sun shone hot on the flat prairie. <i>Blow, . . . wave, . . .
ripple, . . . dip. . . .</i> An intense nausea seized her,--the
<i>mal de mer</i> of the prairie-schooner passenger lurching over
the hot, dry inland sea.</p>
<p>Later in the forenoon they sighted a fringe of trees against
the unclouded sky. It seemed an oasis,--or was it a mirage to
vanish when they should come to it?</p>
<p>"The Weeping Water," Henry Lutz called back. And they knew
they were getting near to the new home.</p>
<p>They crossed the shallow, winding stream not far from a stone
mill. A man with milk-pails in his hands paused to watch the
cavalcade. Will, walking by his ox team, was wet to the
boot-tops.</p>
<p>The man grinned and called out jovially: "You've got your
baptism of the new country now. You're branded. You'll never go
back."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go back," Will called out with equal
jocosity. Abbie in the wagon almost moaned from nausea, heat and
homesickness.</p>
<p>On the other side of the stream there stood a team of oxen
hitched to a covered wagon so odd-looking, that even Abbie sat up
in interest. The wagon-box was a rowboat painted a gaudy blue,
the bow curving toward the stolid oxen's buttocks, the stern
forming the base of the rear canvas doorway. A man with his wife
and two babies waited for the others to come up. Gus Reinmueller,
he said his name was, and jerking an indifferent thumb toward his
wife, he gave a laconic, "My voman, Christine."</p>
<p>Christine seemed as stolid as the oxen, her face as patiently
expressionless. One could not have told whether she was old or
young. Her colorless hair was braided in small braids and wound
flat from ear to ear, looking like a small oval-shaped rug pinned
on the back of her head.</p>
<p>This was the third family, then, to be going up into the same
section with the Deals. And together, after a lunch, the wagons
journeyed on to the west. In a long, straggling line they
journeyed stolidly and silently toward the sun. Of them all, only
Sarah Lutz sometimes called out a cheery comment. Abbie lay on
the wagon bottom, so ill with nausea and heat, that it seemed she
could never again take any interest in life.</p>
<p>Toward evening another long fringe of trees penciled itself
against the dipping sun.</p>
<p>"Stove Creek," Henry Lutz called back. And they knew they were
at their destination.</p>
<p>There were old buffalo wallows along the creek banks, shallow
declivities, where the huge beasts had rolled and stamped out the
mud. The sight of buffalo chips, too, reminded them that the time
was not long past since the shaggy fellows had ambled leisurely
along the creek bed. They crossed the creek, which was little
more than a ravine now, with its few inches of water. And then
Henry Lutz, who was in the lead, stopped.</p>
<p>"Well, here we are," he called when Will and Abbie had caught
up with him. "This is yours." He had a rude paper plan in his
hand. "Mine lies over there to the west. Oscar's is to the north
of mine, and Reinmueller's,--" Gus and Christine had come up in
the ridiculous boat wagon. "Reinmueller's is exactly south of
Deal's."</p>
<p>Abbie crawled out of the wagon-box. She was stiff and ill and
her head ached from the blinding sunlight. Sarah Lutz, with her
round rosy cheeks and her beady black eyes, was out of her wagon,
too, and over to Abbie's.</p>
<p>"Well, you're home." She was chuckling in her merry way. "This
is where you live,--and my good gracious,--you've got callers."
She shook hands with Abbie in mock formality. "May I come in and
sit a while? Yes, thank you, I'll take the rocking-chair, Mrs.
Deal. Yes, thanks, I'll have a cup of tea."</p>
<p>It made Abbie laugh a little, too, the nonsense of it at such
a time. And then, "Boo!" Abbie squealed and jumped and ran for
the wagon. A little dark, lizard-shaped thing had darted close to
her feet with the speed of lightning.</p>
<p>"They're just swifts," Will told her, "as harmless as
mice."</p>
<p>"Yes, and just as horrid," Abbie called back.</p>
<p>They camped in a group for the night. It made quite a party:
Will, Abbie and little Mack, the Oscar Lutzes with their three
children, Henry and Sarah Lutz with Grandpa Lutz and little Dan,
the orphaned nephew, Gus and Christine Reinmueller and their two
babies.</p>
<p>The wagons formed a circle, with a single campfire in the
center. The sun slipped down behind the rim of the world. One of
the men found a spring in the creek bed and brought water. The
others fed the horses and led them down to drink. The women folks
got supper and washed the plates and cups at the side of the
creek bed. The children were put to sleep in the wagons and the
older people gathered around the fire. The stars came out, pale
yellow flowers in the sky's own prairie.</p>
<p>A coyote howled. Another answered. It made Abbie think of a
night on the journey from Illinois when she was eight, and yet
this was different. Then, they had been close to the woods,--the
sheltering woods. They had heard all the little night creatures
at work, all the tiny rustlings of the timber. But this,
paradoxically, was a silent noise. There was complete
silence,--save for those distant coyotes. Silence,--save for a
faint sound of shivering grass. Silence, so deep, that it roared
in its vast vacuum. Silence,--grass,--stars. The group around the
fire seemed suddenly too small to be alone in the still vastness,
too inadequate and helpless.</p>
<p>What if--? Even as her fear formed itself into thought, she
saw through the shadows a figure--and another--and others steal
with panther-like tread between the wagons and the creek bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c10" id="c10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Abbie could frame no words. She could only reach forth her
hand and touch Will's arm, a nightmare of fear upon her. Will and
the other men of the party were also looking toward the shadowy
figures in the dark.</p>
<p>"They're friendly," Will whispered, "there's nothing to be
afraid of."</p>
<p>Friendly? Were they friendly?</p>
<p>All night the Indians camped near the creek bed a little to
the north. Abbie, with Mack upon her arm, did not close her eyes.
Only a year and a half before, the Fort Phil Kearney massacre had
occurred. Only two months before, Red Cloud had sent word that he
would not sign the great Fort Laramie treaty. They were so much
nearer hostile Indians here than back home. You couldn't tell
from what tribe these were. You couldn't tell in the dark how
many there were. All night Abbie lay in an agony of fear, her
body tense, her little son at her breast.</p>
<p>In the morning, fears were dissipated. If there had been any
evil from them it would have been during the night. They proved
to be a small group of Pawnees, with their squaws and papooses.
They had dozens of skinned chickens across their ponies, the
flies thick upon them.</p>
<p>One of Henry Lutz's horses was missing from the bunch which
had been staked together. After a half-concealed conference among
the men folks, it was deemed wiser to accept the loss and not
question the matter. One of the braves evidently had ridden away
on it. The Indians ate, broke camp, came over to the settlers and
examined their outfits. A brave pointed to Oscar Lutz's wife, who
was not exactly dainty in size, and shrugged massive shoulders
jovially, at which the other bucks showed symptoms of ingrowing
mirth. They took their time to peer into all the wagons. One man
picked up a little bright-colored shoulder shawl of Sarah Lutz's
and coolly transferred it to the shoulders of his squaw. The
others gave a few grunts of satisfaction, fell into a long
straggling line and started toward the northwest, the red and
black of the appropriated shawl growing fainter in the
distance.</p>
<p>Abbie wondered if she ever again would pass through such a
fearsome night.</p>
<p>As Henry Lutz had said, the Reinmueller place was south of the
Deal acreage and his own joined it at the west. Abbie was glad to
find that Sarah Lutz was the one who was to live nearer to her.
She had taken a great fancy to the bride with the round rosy
face, the jet black hair and the little beady black eyes that
seemed always twinkling. For Christine Reinmueller she held no
great liking. Christine was uncouth, not quite clean, her little
tight braids wound flat from ear to ear, greasy looking.</p>
<p>The wagons were now each driven onto the families' respective
holdings, forming little homes on wheels until the rude houses
would be finished.</p>
<p>As far as eye could see, the land lay in long rolling swells,
unlike the monotonous flatness which characterized part of the
state farther to the west of which they had heard.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be seen in any direction but the prairie
grass and the few native trees which traced the vagrant
wanderings of Stove Creek. The undulating land covered with
prairie grass, the straggling line of trees along the creek bed
and the cloudless sky composed the entire picture,--these, and
the Deal, Reinmueller and Lutz covered wagons,--little toys in
the vastness of the lonely prairie.</p>
<p>Gus and Christine Reinmueller set about at once making a
dug-out at the end of a ravine near the creek bed. They dug into
the low hillside, set sturdy tree trunks a short way from the
opening and covered the top with poles cut from the branches of
trees, across which they packed a solid roofing of sod. Into
this, with only the hard dirt floor, and the one opening, they
moved their few possessions and their two baby boys. To Abbie it
seemed that they were burrowing in like moles. But Gus was too
anxious to get to work on the land to put much time on living
quarters.</p>
<p>The Lutz family began a frame house at once, Henry and his
brother both working on Henry's, so that when it was finished,
the two families could live in it while Oscar's was being built.
They took turns making the long trips to Nebraska City for
material. The foundation of the house was merely rocks under the
four corners, which, free for the picking up, were hauled from
Weeping Water. The house itself was a two-roomed affair, with
rough boards nailed up and down on the studding, and battened
with narrow strips, but without plastering, so that for the first
winter, Henry would nail burlap sacking all over the
interior.</p>
<p>Will started a sod house. He did not feel that he could yet
build as good a frame as he wanted, and every one said soddies
were warm in winter and cool in summer. He cut strips of sod
three feet long and laid them up as a mason would lay so many
huge bricks, leaving places for the windows which Henry Lutz
agreed to haul out from Nebraska City with whatever other lumber
Will needed. The inside dimensions of the house were thirty by
eighteen, so that when the partition was run through, the general
living-room was eighteen by twenty and the bedroom eighteen by
ten.</p>
<p>Abbie's physical ill-feelings and homesickness had been with
her thus far through the making of the house. The sight of the
prairie grass blowing and dipping in the wind under the cloudless
sky still gave her a sensation of dizziness and nausea. The water
from the spring at the edge of Stove Creek had a peculiar taste,
so that she longed for the old well-water back home. She longed
also for a sight of her mother's placid face under its white cap,
and for a talk with Belle or Mary or Janet. In her low state of
mind she felt uncertainty concerning their prospects, strange
forebodings for the future, a torment that she was to die at
childbirth and leave Will and little Mack.</p>
<p>But on an afternoon when Will was putting on the sod roofing,
something lifted from Abbie's heart. Perhaps it was only because
she was physically better that the deep depression seemed
lightened, the intense homesickness for old scenes lessened. She
put Mack to sleep in the wagon and walked farther up the long
rolling land.</p>
<p>A sense of lightness, such as she had not known for weeks, was
upon her. A revival of hope and courage possessed her. This was
their own land. They, who had never owned a foot of ground, were
now the sole owners of one hundred and sixty acres. Rich soil,
too, Will said,--black and rich. A farm of their own upon which
to make a home,--a home for Mack,--and one other! She wondered,
as all mothers have wondered, which the new baby would be. And
could not quite determine, as all mothers have been not quite
able to determine, which she rather it would be. A boy would be
the nicer for one reason,--he could be a chum for Mack. But a
little girl,--down in her heart she hoped it would be a little
girl. She remembered what she had said to her mother in the old
cabin loft, back home. "Some day we may have a little girl. We
will be rich then and she can wear the pearls." Well, maybe the
baby would be a girl,--here was the good black soil upon which to
get rich,--and over in the wagon were the pearls. She and Will
were young. Life was all before them. With neighbors not far
away, it was not going to be so lonely. Sarah Lutz--already she
loved Sarah. And Christine Reinmueller,--even though Christine
was so "Dutchy," she was kind hearted. Their own land, two
babies, youth, neighbors! No, life here was not going to be so
bad. She raised her head to the cloudless September sky.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Her voice rose clear, full-throated, mature.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Dreamed of visions longingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, she and Will would soon be wealthy. Will had said so.
Youth, babies, friends, wealth! She put the joy of it into
melody:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"When she held in bower or hall<br>
Banquet high or festival,<br>
On every side her glance would fall . . ."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>A crow, flying above her, wheeled and dipped down toward her,
"Caw! Caw!" it threw down at her saucily. Abbie broke off
singing.</p>
<p>"Were you jeering at me?" she called after the vagrant
wanderer.</p>
<p>"Caw! caw!" it threw back raucously.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a sign. Maybe it was a <i>bad</i> sign. Grandma
Deal would have said it was. Then she threw back her head and
laughed. Oh, well, she was young. Her voice wouldn't run away and
leave her. In a little while she could get to a teacher
somewhere,--over the prairie to Nebraska City or back to
Plattsmouth, or perhaps even up to Omaha some day.</p>
<p>As she started back to the prairie schooner, with the song
unfinished, a long, slimy, gruesome Thing slipped, belly-flat,
through the grass. Abbie shuddered and scrambled into the
sheltering wagon.</p>
<p>The rough edges of the black sod of the house were now treated
to a thick coat of mud plaster and a board floor laid. The low
partition, over which she could hang clothes, and the crude board
door, Abbie papered with hoop-skirted feminine paragons of style
out of Godey's <i>Ladies' Book,</i> from which vantage point they
looked down upon the humble interior with supercilious pride.</p>
<p>This, then, was the house into which Abbie moved from the
prairie schooner,--Abbie, the granddaughter of Isabelle
Anders-Mackenzie with her town house and her two country estates,
her silk shawl, her pearls and her jeweled fan, her reddish-brown
hair and her long slender fingers that tapered at the ends. But
with the same pride that had rearranged the sumptuous furnishings
in the ancestral home across the sea, Abbie now hung curtains at
the windows, tacked burlap gunny-sacking on the floor, put down
the small braided rag rugs, and made up the two clean beds. Under
one of these she put the calf-skin-covered chest which held the
pearls and the paints, and in the deep window-seat formed by the
width of the sod strips, she set the Seth Thomas clock with the
little brown church painted on the glass. There was one
"boughten" cupboard for the dishes and Will made another one of
store boxes to hold Abbie's books,--the Shakespeare plays and the
Bible, the McGuffy readers, and a few other textbooks.</p>
<p>There was a four-holed stove whose long pipe protruded through
the sod roof, three chairs, and a table with a declivity in one
corner of it in which Doc Matthews had always rolled pills. A
couch, which might also serve as an extra bed, was made of the
same type of sod strips which had been used in the house, and
covered with a feather bed and "The Rose of Sharon," one of
Grandma Deal's quilts of intricate design. The rooms were both
furnished now. The little soddie was not much of a house, but it
was that other thing,--that intangible thing of the spirit called
home.</p>
<p>As soon as his work on the house was finished, Will started on
a shed for the stock. And in the mild October weather before the
frosts had come, he broke sod on one portion of the land, so that
it would be ready for slightly easier plowing in the spring.</p>
<p>With November the mild weather ceased. The winds, that seemed
never still, blew harder from the open country to the north and
west. Dried tumbleweeds, round in shape and as large as bushel
baskets, rolled over the prairie with the winds, like great
platoons of charging cavalry. Abbie, standing sometimes at the
little soddie window, would watch the ceaseless riding of the
brown-coated swashbucklers, the unending onslaught of Nature's
artillerymen. On and on they came,--mounted rifles, dragoons,
hussars,--columns, companies, regiments, brigades. They swept by,
to disappear in the distance, only to be followed by reserves
from farther out on the prairie.</p>
<p>It gave her a sense of fear,--fear that the unseen force which
sent the slender-stemmed, globular-shaped weeds on their endless
journey, might suddenly send her, too, on the hard ride.</p>
<p>When Will took the long drive to Nebraska City for supplies,
her desolation seemed complete. She would catch up little Mack,
who was a year and a half now and toddling everywhere, and hold
him to her with a prayer for safety from all the unknown
terrors,--Indians, winds, prairie fires, storms, her own hour of
travail.</p>
<p>Will brought back corn meal and one precious sack of white
flour for which he had paid ten dollars. So sparing was Abbie in
its use, that it was nearly spring when the last bit was baked
and the sack made into an apron for herself.</p>
<p>It was in the middle of the first night in March that Abbie
knew her hour had come. The March winds, like so many wild March
hares, were running past the little soddie. Will dressed
hurriedly, replenished the fire, and with a word of
encouragement, was gone into the night. Abbie, bolting the door
behind him, knew the greatest fear of all for prairie women,--to
be alone on the desert of grass with the pangs of childbirth upon
her. "Oh, God, bring Will and the doctor safe home." The winds
blew. Little Mack slept. Abbie's body was wracked. "Oh, God, send
some one."</p>
<p>And then some one pounded on the door: <i>"Ein! . . . Las mich
ein . . .</i> Christine." Abbie opened the door, and Christine
Reinmueller came in, her fat face red from the cold wind, her
little tight greasy braids flattened from ear to ear. She looked
beautiful to Abbie.</p>
<p>It was hours before Will came with the doctor from Weeping
Water. And then Abbie had her little girl,--the little daughter
who was to wear pearls and all the lovely things that should go
with them. Will brought Mack in and showed him the new sister,
and Mack promptly welcomed her by poking a fat forefinger into
her eye and mouth to see if she really worked.</p>
<p>They named her Margaret,--for both grandmothers. "It will
please them both," Abbie fibbed politely. Almost she could hear
Grandma Deal saying: "What did they do that fool thing for?"</p>
<p>Mackenzie Deal and Margaret Deal! A son and a daughter! Such a
big family! She and Will laughed together in their relief and
happiness.</p>
<p>And now, Abbie's love was divided between two babies. No, that
is not true. There is no division nor subtraction in the
heart-arithmetic of a good mother. There are only addition and
multiplication.</p>
<p>March was cold, windy, snow-filled,--the land a desolate
waste. Grayish-white snow over the low rolling hills,--a
grayish-white sky like the pale reflection of those rolling hills
in an opaque glass! And into the gray vastness of the sky, three
little thin lines of smoke from the stove-pipes through the roofs
of a dugout, a chink-battened frame and a soddie,--incense
ascending to the God of Homes!</p>
<p>And then, the miracle! Spring came over the prairie,--not
softly, shyly, but in great magic strides. It was in the flush of
green on the elders and willows by Stove Creek. It was in the
wind,--in the smell of loam and grasses, in the tantalizing odor
of wild plums budding and wild violets flowering. Nature, the
alchemist, took them all, the faint odors of the loam and the
grasses, the willow buds and the little wild flowers, and mixing
them in her mortar, threw them over the prairie on the wings of
the wind.</p>
<p>Will could scarcely wait to begin spring plowing. Only then
would it seem that the work on the place was really under way. He
saw the frost ooze out of the broken sod and the heavy rolling
clouds lose their frozen firmness. Twice he made an attempt to
start the hand-plow and found the ground not ready. And then on a
morning, with the prairie-lark calling to him, he started. Abbie
took the baby in her arms and went out, with Mack toddling by her
side. Gyp, the young dog of nondescript breeding which they had
brought with them, ran frantically about, chasing some little
flying thing. Abbie constantly darted a look near Mack, never
allowing him more than a few feet from her, the fear of the
deadly rattle-snake always with her.</p>
<p>Usually undemonstrative, Will slipped an arm around Abbie.
Serious and reticent, he seldom voiced his deepest feelings. But
now he spoke them:</p>
<p>"It'll be a pull, Abbie-girl, but some day you'll see I was
right. The furrows will go everywhere up and down these rolling
hills. Bigger plows than mine will roll them back. There'll maybe
be a town here," he pointed to the limitless horizon, "and a
village there. Omaha will be a big center. The little capital
village of Lincoln will grow. It's bound to come. Not
to-day,--nor to-morrow, but some other day and some other
to-morrow. You'll live to see a fine capitol building and schools
and stores and churches and nice homes."</p>
<p>Prophetic words! A town lies here and a village there. Huge
tractors turn a half dozen furrows in one trip across the fields.
Omaha and Lincoln are great centers for commercial, industrial
and educational interests. Where once the Indian pitched his
tepee for a restless day, there are groupings of schools and
churches and stores and homes. And Abbie Deal lived to see the
beginnings of the tall majestic tower of the most beautiful
capitol of them all lift its white shaft to the sky,--a capitol
unashamed of its native products, into whose marble artistry have
gone the buffalo and the corn and the goldenrod.</p>
<p>Will stood a moment, a little abashed at his emotion, so that
immediately he said lightly, "Well, here goes."</p>
<p>The first loam turned back, clean-cut with the sharp knife of
the plowshare, mellow, black as a crow's wing. A fringe of coarse
grass held fast to the heavy soil, as though the two could not be
parted after all these wild, free centuries together,--the grass
maiden clinging to the breast of her prairie lover.</p>
<p>Abbie turned abruptly and went into the house with the babies.
Inside she cried a little into the long roller towel,--she did
not know just why. Then she pulled herself together. "This will
never do. There's no time for idle tears. If I am to do my share
in all that Will thinks he sees, I must get a good dinner for
him." The man at the plow, the woman at the stove,--it was
symbolic.</p>
<p>That spring the new life began in earnest. To Abbie, the
future gleamed with bright prospects. New settlers were coming in
every day,--already the precinct had thirteen families. In such a
little while the community would be well settled. In such a short
time they would all be rich. And so Abbie Deal went happily about
her work, one baby in her arms and the other at her skirts,
courage her lode-star and love her guide,--a song upon her lips
and a lantern in her hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c11" id="c11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>That summer was a summer of hard work and high hopes.
Everything was to be done. Will, in his keen desire for results,
worked early and late. He broke out more raw prairie and planted
it, cut and hauled wood from the creek, chopped it in stove
length, cared for his stock, and did the work of two men. He
dropped into bed when he could not see to do anything more and
was up before the sun rose over the fringe of elms and elders and
willows on Stove Creek.</p>
<p>And Abbie? Abbie took care of little two-year-old Mack and the
new baby, Margaret, washed with little water, ironed with
cumbersome flat-irons next to a cook stove that was a fiery
furnace, cooked from a meager store of supplies, made soap out of
doors, standing over the hot contents of a huge iron kettle,
sewed and mended, tried vainly to keep the house clean, and took
sole care of the chickens, which, like their owners, boasted a
sod residence. The tapering Mackenzie fingers were never
idle.</p>
<p>Will had many long trips to make, and Abbie, bundling up the
two babies and taking along supplies for them, went with him.
They drove the long way to Nebraska City to get cottonwood
seedlings from the sand-bars there, as the little young trees
growing in the pliable soil could be pulled out with one twist.
They left feed and water for the chickens, but took the cow with
them, tying her to the wagon. Abbie put in her churn with some
cream in it, and the lurching motion of the wagon furnished them
with butter, which was passable, although decidedly not as good
as when cooled in the spring water. Will took his double-barreled
shotgun along and killed prairie chickens on the way, which
Abbie, as she sat in the back of the wagon, picked to cook for
supper.</p>
<p>"It's a good thing we're not trying to run away from the law,"
she called out to Will, "for we could be traced clear across the
prairie by a trail of chicken feathers."</p>
<p>Whenever they came to the homesteads of settlers they tried to
move straight with the surveyed sections, but over railroad and
school lands they drove to their destination through the
trackless prairie grass as straight, if not as swiftly, as the
crow flew.</p>
<p>Both the cottonwood and the willows would grow also from
cuttings, so that on their return Will brought up a huge
cottonwood branch from the creek and Abbie cut the whole thing
into slips for Will to set out to the north of the sod house for
a potential wind break. From their own creek bed they obtained
willow whips and these were planted near the chicken house. Every
one was planning for future shade.</p>
<p>To the north and west of them, Oliver Johnson, a young
bachelor and a Dartmouth graduate, put out a timber claim. By
planting and caring for ten acres of trees for eight years he
would be able to obtain a good one hundred and sixty acres from
the government.</p>
<p>In every activity on the place Will took pains to plan right.
"We have to think what we're doing and lay it out just as we want
it in the future," he told Abbie. "We'll be able to build a good
frame house one of these days and we want the whole place planned
so we'll not need to make changes."</p>
<p>Abbie pondered a great deal over the arrangement. "Right over
there, Will, the new house ought to be . . . on that rise of
ground. Then some day there'll be a road. I can kind-of see now
how it will be. A nice house up there on the rise and the road
running east and west past the house, then a lane road turning in
from the main one. And fences. . . . Oh, I think, Will, when we
get fences, I'll like it better. It seems so sort of heathenish
to come across the country any way. There ought to be nice
straight roads everywhere and fences to show where our land
begins and ends. And a picket fence around the house yard . . . a
nice fence, painted white . . . with red hollyhocks and blue
larkspur along by it, against the white pickets."</p>
<p>Will laughed. "You're quite a dreamer, Abbie-girl."</p>
<p>Abbie did not laugh. She was suddenly sober. "You have to,
Will." She said it a little vehemently. "You <i>have</i> to dream
things out. It keeps a kind of an ideal before you. You see it
first in your mind and then you set about to try to make it like
the ideal. If you want a garden,--why, I guess you've got to
<i>dream</i> a garden." Then she looked out at the small plot of
vegetables, and laughed,--not quite joyfully, a little ruefully.
They looked so wilted and so lackadaisical, so uninterested in
life, those potatoes and turnips and beans.</p>
<p>All this time they had used the spring at the edge of the
creek, and now Will was digging the well. Henry Lutz came over to
operate the windlass that raised the buckets which Will filled
with dirt. In return for the work, Will was to assist Henry in
the same way as soon as his own well would be finished. On one of
the days of the well-digging Henry brought word that the
Burlington road had sent its first train across the Missouri at
Plattsmouth. It made the men feel good. Things were coming along
fine, they told each other.</p>
<p>On a later afternoon Henry could not come, and Abbie, as
anxious as Will that the work should go forward, pitted her own
young strength against the weight of the dirt-filled buckets. All
afternoon, her face purple with heat and exertion, she worked
under the sun's fire and in the wind's hot breath, only leaving
her post to nurse the baby at her heated breast.</p>
<p>When it seemed that she could not stand it longer, that
through the perspiration of her eyes she saw only a tortuous
shimmering heat over the land, Will signaled to be pulled up.</p>
<p>Slowly, painfully, exerting every ounce of strength she
possessed, Abbie wound the rope of the windlass. Suddenly,
treacherously, the handle slipped from her perspiring hands and
struck her head with black and blinding force. When she came
slowly back from the dark spaces of some vacuous cavern, she
could hear Mack's wailing cry of, "Muvver . . . Muvver," as he
bent over her and pulled at her fluttering eyelids,--could hear
Will's faint and frantic call, "Abbie . . . Abbie . . . where are
you?"</p>
<p>She sat up and tried to recall just what had happened,
suddenly remembering that Will must have been dropped back into
the well with terrific force. He might be badly hurt. It gave her
strength. She was up and calling to him. No, he was not hurt, was
shaken up a little, but nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>And then Abbie must go for help to get Will out. Over and over
she cautioned little Mack to stay away, up by the house,
explained repeatedly how he must not go near the big hole. Then,
bruised and bleeding at the forehead, she went across the hot
prairie to get Gus, the fear of the horrible rattle-snake present
with every grass-hidden step. There was no one home at the
Reinmuellers'. Repeated callings brought no one from the dug-out
or rude sheds. Back to the Henry Lutz place she sped, where she
found Henry and Sarah, who immediately hitched the team, brought
her back in the wagon, and rescued Will.</p>
<p>Indians came through the community every little while in their
straggling, single-file way of traveling. They were said to be
friendly, but the settlers could not trust them. Nothing ever
filled Abbie with so much fear as the sight of two or three
unidentified figures appearing upon the horizon. And in August,
when news filtered into the community that a band of ten
government surveyors had been massacred by a band of Sioux under
Pawnee Killer out in the Republican Valley, she felt that only a
word from Will would be needed to abandon everything and go back
home.</p>
<p>Only a few days later four of the fear-inspiring creatures
stopped at the house and signified they wanted eatables. They ate
greedily of the pork and beans Abbie set before them and when
they seemed satisfied, coolly turned the remaining food into
their dirty blankets, and went on over the prairie in their
straggling single-file way, the poles of their tepees dragging
from the scrawny ponies' sides.</p>
<p>It was late that same month that Henry Lutz came tearing up to
the Deal soddie on a horse.</p>
<p>"Something has happened to little Dan," he called without
dismounting. "We don't know what. Go over and stay with Sarah,
will you, while I ride for Doc Keeney?"</p>
<p>Will hitched the horses hurriedly and Abbie got in with Mack
and the baby, Margaret. When they started away they saw Christine
coming, so they drove back and waited for her.</p>
<p>Sarah Lutz was frantic, her round rosy face drawn with fright.
They had been pulling their cabbages from the weed-bend of the
creek to make kraut, she said. Dan helped a little, but about
four he said his leg hurt. "We told him to rest . . . thought he
was just tired. He complained more about it after we got to the
house . . . and when we looked at it . . ." Sarah covered her
blanched face with her hands. "It's swollen . . . twice as big .
. . and it's . . . Oh, God, Abbie, it's black."</p>
<p>Doctor Keeney came. He went into the little bedroom and when
he came out, his tired face above the grizzled beard was drawn
and his eyes grief-filled.</p>
<p>"It's . . ." he threw out his hands in a gesture of despair,
"snake-bite. I'll do what I can . . . but . . . it's too late. .
. ." He had whispered it, but the words rang through the room . .
. tolled through the house. Little Dan, with his sunny ways, to
be a victim of the Menace!</p>
<p>They all waited there in the night,--waited for death to find
little Dan on the wild barren prairie. Such a little boy for
death to find in the vastness of the new country! But it found
him. Riding over the prairie with the wind that was never still,
the white horseman found him.</p>
<p>Will made the pine box down at the barn, and Abbie and
Christine lined it with Sarah's best quilt. Sarah,
grief-stricken, would let no one else wash and dress him. Henry
rode to Plattsmouth for a missionary minister. Other settlers
came long distances to the Lutz house in their wagons. Their
sympathy was deep and sincere. And it took concrete form. They
brought wild-grape jelly and corn biscuits, baked prairie
chickens and a roast of pork.</p>
<p>They buried the little boy on a knoll of the Lutz land. The
settlers with bared heads stood around the deep yawning hole in
the ground. Abbie, her throat too stiff and tense to follow the
melody correctly, sang an old hymn. The minister talked of a God
who made all things work together for good. Abbie thought she
could not stand it! Death! How she hated it and feared it!</p>
<p>There was not a tree near. The August sun blazed down on the
rolling hill. The hot wind from the southwest blew over it. The
blackbirds and crows flew and wheeled low above it. The coarse
prairie grass bent before the wind. <i>Blow . . . wave,</i> . . .
<i>ripple, . . . dip. . . . Blow, . . . wave,</i> . . .
<i>ripple, . . . dip. .</i> . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c12" id="c12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There was very little crop that fall. The settlers learned
that sod-corn never amounts to much. What few ears formed, Will
fed on the stalk.</p>
<p>"I don't care. I'm not disappointed," he said, "I knew it
would take a year to get a start."</p>
<p>But Abbie knew it was not so. Abbie knew that Will cared.</p>
<p>The stubble and roots, rotting all winter in the newly broken
fields, fertilized the ground, and so it was with high hopes that
Will went into the field the first spring of the 'seventies.</p>
<p>Abbie's summer was one of fighting sickness, in addition to
her many tasks. Both children had the measles and the whooping
cough later, as did the Reinmuellers' three and Sarah Lutz's new
baby daughter, Emma. The mothers doctored them as well as they
could with simple remedies, catnip tea and Indian herbs, hanging
over their beds, watching anxiously for every change. When her
children came out from under the cloud of illness, Abbie felt
that it was like coming out of a dark cavern into the sunshine.
Once more she sang at her tasks.</p>
<p>The crop of 1870 was only fair. So much hard work for so
little results! Nothing but the cottonwoods seemed to thrive
luxuriantly. Already after their second summer, some of those
which they had brought from the sand-bars were as tall as Will.
Their little shimmering, dancing leaves were a solace to Abbie.
They seemed courageous and cheerful, undaunted by the hot sun,
undisturbed by cold rains, unafraid of the rushing winds.</p>
<p>Will had set out an orchard now. Oscar and Henry Lutz had sent
east to their brother for nursery stock, and the Reinmuellers and
Deals ordered fruit trees, too. The spindling whips of apples and
cherries with their names still tied upon them, looked a rather
hopeless lot rambling row upon row over the raw prairie.</p>
<p>There was always so much to be done. One never could satisfy
the demands of Work, that taskmaster which drove every one in the
new country before the lash.</p>
<p>Sometimes Abbie would stand at the door of the soddie and look
across the unshaded prairie where the sunflowers added their
brilliant yellow to the blinding yellow of the sun, and standing
so for a few moments, she would think of the lovely lady with the
bronze tints in her reddish hair. She had wanted to be like her.
But how could one be a lovely lady when there was not always
enough water to keep immaculately clean?</p>
<p>Will was her strength and her courage. In one of her hours of
depression she had only to confide her mood to him, to have it
lifted by his optimism.</p>
<p>"Everything is going to be all right," he would assure her.
"Think of the Burlington road reaching Lincoln last week. Think
of it! Building right up,--everything is."</p>
<p>"Yes, but Will,--there are so many things we need. And I want,
. . . Oh, Will . . . I want an organ so <i>bad.</i> I'll be
twenty-four this fall . . . and my music . . ."</p>
<p>"My, you're getting old," he would joke her. "Most an old
woman, ain't you?" And then more seriously, "Maybe you can have
your organ next year, Abbie-girl. We'll have good crops next
year."</p>
<p>But next year, 1871, the crop, like the others, was only half
a crop. Will was right about the land. The soil itself was rich
enough. But the rains held off. Day after day the clouds, as
white and dry and puffy as milk-weed seeds, scudded high with the
winds.</p>
<p>In that fourth fall, on a mild September day, the air was hazy
and they could detect the telltale, far-off odor of smoke. Not a
man left his home. Will, the Lutz brothers, Gus Reinmueller,--all
were out for hours plowing wide strips around their places. They
knew there were only three things that would stop a prairie fire
in its mad, wild flight, and even those were ineffective at
times,--wide strips of upturned loam upon which there was nothing
for the fire to feed, creeks that were wide enough to prevent the
flames from leaping them, or a back-fire,--the burning of a wide
strip of prairie grass by the settlers themselves, so that when
the flames arrived they found themselves beaten by their own
kind.</p>
<p>It was close to three in the afternoon when they saw it roll
in from the northwest, the black of the smoke, and the low
running scarlet of the fire.</p>
<p>Stove Creek, the best friend in the world to the four families
that day, lay between them and the hideous advancing Thing. The
men, Will and Gus Reinmueller, Henry and Oscar Lutz, all
scattered along the creek bed, ready to pounce upon any flying
embers that might cross the deadline. All afternoon the women
carried wet gunny-sacks back and forth. They could see the little
house where Oliver Johnson "bached it," standing in the way of
the angry flames. Oliver, himself, came across the creek over to
the Deal side, riding one horse and leading the other, a big wash
boiler in front of him. He had been away, he said, and arrived
home only in time to grab a boiler, thrust his Sunday suit, some
money, a tin-type of his girl into it, and leave. Even as they
talked, they saw the little house catch fire and almost
immediately a great bunch of geese feathers flying up into the
air, like a puff of white smoke.</p>
<p>"There goes my mother's feather bed," was Oliver's laconic
remark, as he fell into the work of wetting the gunny-sacks along
with the others.</p>
<p>When the last of the jaws of flame ceased reaching for their
prey, the land across the creek was a desolate black waste, the
trees on the north bank charred and gone. One more enemy was
temporarily vanquished. But it had left its mark on the land and
the fear of it branded forever in the minds of the settlers.</p>
<p>The next spring, the State Board of Agriculture, through a
resolution offered by J. Sterling Morton, a Nebraska City man,
set aside the tenth of April, as a special day on which the
settlers should plant trees. They called it Arbor Day. Although
Will had set out a great many trees previously, he spent the day
adding to his own windbreaks and hauling cottonwood saplings for
Henry Lutz who was sick at the time.</p>
<p>When Henry was up again, he built an addition of two rooms on
to his house and opened a store in one of them, the stock
consisting of six brooms, ten bolts of cloth, a dozen bottles of
patent medicine and a few staple groceries. His first customer
was Christine Reinmueller who bought brown denim for her baby's
dress. She put one corner of the goods between her teeth and
pulled on it. "Everyt'ing . . . <i>sie reis . . .</i> rip." She
jerked the cloth to test its strength. "You t'ink dis <i>sie
reis</i> . . . rip . . . nein?"</p>
<p>A few rods to the east of the Lutz combination store and
house, Oscar Lutz built a blacksmith shop and hired a
blacksmith-preacher to do the work. For six days Sam Mowery
labored at the anvil and on the seventh day the Reverend Samuel
Mowery preached three miles away in the schoolhouse known by the
appropriate appellation of Sodom College. A store and a
blacksmith shop! People began saying, "Over to the Stove Creek
store," and then, "Over to Stove Creek."</p>
<p>Mail was brought now by a man on horseback, en route from
Weeping Water to Ashland. Twice a week he would stop with the
little packet at the Lutz store, as Henry had been made
postmaster.</p>
<p>They began to talk about getting a doctor to come in. Will
heard of a young Dr. Hornby, who had just arrived at Nebraska
City after graduating from Rush. He rode on horseback to
interview him, and the young fellow returned on his own horse
behind Will, his mutton-chop whiskers blowing back against his
pink-cheeked boyish face, his medicine-case and a valise tied on
the saddle.</p>
<p>A store, a post office, a blacksmith shop, a preacher, a
doctor,--and all in two buildings. The town had begun.</p>
<p>It was Sarah Lutz and Abbie Deal who began talking about the
crudeness of the "Stove Creek" title. They were both setting out
little cedar trees, Sarah in a clump behind the store, Abbie in a
row in front of the soddie.</p>
<p>"Cedar City, Abbie," Sarah said suddenly.</p>
<p>"Or Cedartown," Abbie added.</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe I like that best . . . all in one word."</p>
<p>Cedartown! A store and a blacksmith shop! But the Deals and
the Lutzes, the Reverend Samuel Mowery and his wife and Dr.
Hornby would all correct any passerby who asked innocently if
this was Stove Creek.</p>
<p>"Cedartown," they would say impressively. And so,
Minerva-like, Cedartown had sprung forth from the brow of the
prairie.</p>
<p>The crop of that year, 1872, was as poor as that of the
previous summer. In September, Abbie's third child was born.
Sarah was there helping, now, and Christine was at home with her
own new baby. The child was a son, healthy, loud-voiced, hungry.
Abbie and Will joked a little over the size of their family and
they argued some over the newcomer's name. Will wanted to call
him John.</p>
<p>"It doesn't sound just right," Abbie protested. "John Deal.
It's too short . . . like 'Tick-tack' . . . or 'Pot-luck.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't care," Will gave in readily enough. "I just liked
it. It sounds solid and substantial as though he might amount to
something."</p>
<p>Abbie pulled the little soft sleeping form into the hollow of
her arm. "I <i>know</i> he'll amount to something."</p>
<p>After that she could not get the thought of the "John" out of
her mind. "John Deal," she said it over several times. "Will's
right. It just fits him. Some day people will say, 'Go and ask
John Deal. He's a smart man. He can advise you.'" She lay and
smiled at the vision. If the faith of all the mothers could
blossom to its full fruition, there would be no unsuccessful men
in the land.</p>
<p>Mack was nearly six now and Margaret four, so that when Abbie
was up again, and strong enough, she began to teach them their
letters. Will painted a board with black paint and brought some
soft chalk-like deposit from the Platte with which they could
print. The oldest Reinmueller and Lutz children had started to
school at Sodom College, but Abbie would not let Mack go so far.
So to her other labors she now added teaching.</p>
<p>All winter during the deep snows when they were shut in, she
gave the children lessons to do, hearing them recite in their
queer little ways, while she was mending or mixing bread or
ironing. It was tiresome, shut in the small soddie, and spring
was a welcome guest. On Easter morning, accompanied by the
faithful dog, who would kill a snake whenever he found one, Abbie
took Mack and Margaret and little John down to the creek bank for
flowers. Will had made a wagon in which to pull John, the wheels
of round disks cut from a young cottonwood, and now at seven
months, the baby lay in it and blinked solemn eyes at the April
sky. It was an advanced spring and they found blue and yellow
violets, Dutchmen's breeches, ferns, and the tiny red buds of the
hawthorn.</p>
<p>"Smell!" said Abbie, "smell the springtime on the prairie."
And Mack and Margaret stood and sniffed miniature olfactory
organs.</p>
<p>"What makes it smell sweet?" they wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Because everything,--every little wild plum-blossom, every
little tiny crocus and anemone and violet and every tree-bud and
grass-blade is working to help make the prairie nice," Abbie told
them. [And who is there to say this was not a beginners' class in
philosophy?]</p>
<p>The day was hot, with a strong wind from the south, so that
they did not stay long at the creek bed. On the way back to the
house it clouded, and by the time they had reached it, the drops
were falling. In the night the rain changed to snow and when the
family awoke in the early morning, the storm was shrieking around
the soddie with cyclonic fury. Great wet clumps of snow were
being hurled against the small half-windows and snow had been
driven through the cracks of the door. The wind and the snow,
whirling together in their wild Bacchanalia, seemed laughing
drunkenly at the tiny pigmy inmates of the tiny prairie
house.</p>
<p>Will started to open the door to go to his stock and could
scarcely shut it again against the storm's rage. In the brief
interval of its half opening, huge chunks of soft snow, with a
rush and roar of wind had been blown the length of the room. With
the life of the stock depending upon him, he made another attempt
to leave the house in the afternoon. He succeeded in getting to
the barn, but came back discouraged, for the snow had blown
through every crack and crevice.</p>
<p>By the third day of this holocaust of Nature's, the storm
abated. Will found some of the chickens dead, and his horses and
three cows had stamped so much snow under their feet that their
backs were nearly to the top of the shed. There were dead prairie
chickens everywhere, and the trees along the creek bank where the
little family had so recently picked violets, were packed so
solid as to make a snow wall.</p>
<p>The snows melted and the creek rose. The flowers bloomed again
and summer was upon the land.</p>
<p>But if the previous years had been hard, that one seemed to
reach the lowest point of the settlers' existence. The panic of
1873 was upon the state. The bottom of the market dropped out and
prices were so low that it did not even pay to haul the scanty
crop to market. When eggs were five cents a dozen and butter
eight cents a pound, cattle and hogs two cents, wheat fifty cents
a bushel, and corn eight, of what use to haul them all thirty or
forty miles? Of what use to haul a load of corn a day's journey
and bring back a load of coal which cost much more than the corn?
So Will and Abbie, along with the neighbors, began burning the
corn for fuel. It made a fire of intensity, a fire that crackled
and held its heat as well as any coal. Sometimes, too, they used
hard twisted hay. When winter came on, Will took Abbie's
washboiler and removing the two front lids of the cook stove,
turned the boiler upside down over the open holes, forming a sort
of drum that seemed to heat the room a little better.</p>
<p>The crop of 1874 was the sixth crop and it seemed to give a
little more promise than the previous ones. By the twentieth of
July, Will had laid by all his corn. Most of his small grain was
in the shocks, but one oat field of a few acres was still uncut.
Standing there under the July sun, its ripened surface seemed to
reflect back the yellow rays. In the afternoon Abbie went out to
pick a mess of beans. The garden had come to be Abbie's care.
Aside from the potato crop, to which Will attended, she looked
after the entire garden. It was quite generally so,--the men
bending all their energies to bigger things, the corn and wheat
and the stock, with the chickens and the gardens falling to the
lot of the wives. Some of the women went into the fields.
Christine Reinmueller was out beside Gus many days. Will drew the
line at that. "When you have to do that, we'll quit," he
said.</p>
<p>Abbie, in her starched sunbonnet, began picking beans for
supper. She could see Will and Henry Lutz working together,
shocking the last of Henry's oats. To-morrow the two would work
together on Will's last stand. It was nice for the men to be so
neighborly.</p>
<p>It seemed hazy in the west. By the time she had finished the
long rows, a big panful of the yellow pods in her arms, Will had
come home from the Lutzes.' In the welcome shade of the house
Abbie took off her bonnet, wiped her flushed, perspiring face and
waited for Will to come up.</p>
<p>"My . . . it's a scorcher." She looked hot and tired.</p>
<p>In a moment of tenderness, more to be desired because of its
rarity, Will picked up Abbie's hands. The slender nails were
stubbed and broken,--the grime of the garden was on her tapering
fingers. He lifted her hand suddenly and kissed the hollow of it.
As his lips touched the calloused palms, his eyes filled with
rare tears. He uttered a short swift oath, "I wish you didn't
have to, Abbie-girl. It's tough for you. Some day . . . in a few
years . . . we'll pull out. Weather conditions may change . . .
the land will be high. . . . You can have better things . . . and
your organ. That singing and painting of yours . . . maybe we can
get to a teacher then. . . ."</p>
<p>It affected Abbie as it always did. In a moment like that it
seemed the end and aim of everything . . . the family. All her
dreams for herself were as nothing. In her own moment of emotion
she returned, "We'll make it, Will . . . don't worry!"</p>
<p>For a moment they stood together looking out over the raw
rolling acreage. Even as they looked, the sun darkened and the
day took on a grayness. They looked for the storm, and heard it
as soon as they saw it,--a great black cloud roar out of the
west, with a million little hissing vibrations. Their eyes on the
sky, neither moved. Then there was a cessation of the roaring, a
soft thud of dropping things, and the cloud of a billion wings
lay on the fields.</p>
<p>"Grasshoppers," they said simultaneously, incredulously.</p>
<p>The grasshoppers swarmed over the young waist-high corn and
the pasture and the garden. By evening the long rows of sweet
corn had been eaten to the plowed ground. The tender vines of the
tomatoes were stripped down to the stalk. The buds of the fruit
trees were gone. Part of the garden was a memory. The chickens
had feasted themselves to the bursting point. Gus Reinmueller,
driving up to the door, could hardly control his raring horses,
so irritated were they by the bouncing, thumping pests. The farm
was a squirming, greenish-gray mass of them.</p>
<p>All evening Will sat by the stove with his head in his hands.
It was the first time he had visibly lost his grit. Abbie went
over to him and ran her hand through his hair. She tried to think
of something to console him. "Don't, Will. . . . There's one
thing we can do. There's the string of pearls. We can always fall
back on it. There must be jewelry stores in Omaha that would take
it and pay well. You take the team and make the drive. . . . You
can do it in three days, . . . and I'll look after things here.
When Mother gave the pearls to me, she said, 'You'll ne'er starve
with them' . . . and we won't, Will. We'll sell them for the
children's sake."</p>
<p>Will threw her hands away from his hair roughly and stood up.
"Hell . . . no!" He yelled it at her. "I've taken your music away
from you and your painting and your teaching and some of your
health. But, <i>by God, . . .</i> I won't take your mother's
present to you."</p>
<p>He slammed the rough soddie door and went out to the barn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c13" id="c13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>By the next night the stalks of field corn were skeletons, a
few delicate veins of leaves left, like so many white bones
bleaching on the desert of the fields. At the end of three days
the oat field was stripped almost as bare as the day the plow had
finished its work. The young orchard was a graveyard of hopes.
Some of the small grain previously harvested had been saved, and
luckily, one digging of early potatoes was in the hole in the
ground in which Will always kept them. But everything else went
through the crunching incisors of the horde. It was as though the
little grayish-green fiends became a composite whole,--one
colossal insect into whose grinding maw went all the green of the
fields and the gardens, all the leaves and tender twigs of the
young fruit trees, all the dreams and the hopes of the
settlers.</p>
<p>The pests were everywhere. With nightmarish persistence, they
appeared in everything. As tightly as Will kept the well covered,
he drew them up in the bucket, so that he began going back to the
old spring for water. Abbie caught them eating the curtains of
the little half-windows and sent them to a fiery death. She was
forced to dry the weekly wash around the cook stove, her one
attempt to hang it in the sun ending speedily with a dozen
perforations in the first billowing garment.</p>
<p>The garden was a total loss. They had tried to save some of
the beans by putting gunny-sacks over them and weighting them
down with stones from the creek bed. The grasshoppers, after
eating the beans, had begun on the gunny-sacks.</p>
<p>"Will they eat the stones, too, Mother?" Mack wanted to know.
And they could not laugh at him.</p>
<p>Abbie wrote a letter to her sister Mary, telling of this last
hard piece of luck. Even letters were expensive luxuries so that
one was made to do for the entire group of relatives back in
eastern Iowa. She gave the letter to Will, who said that he would
ride over to the little post office in the Lutz store as soon as
he had finished caring for the stock. In an hour Will came in
holding the letter by a corner. The edges of the envelope had
been eaten all the way around with little neat flutings so that
the two sides fell apart and the letter fluttered to the floor.
The pocket of his old denim coat, where the letter had lain, was
flapping down, cut on two sides by the same diabolical jaws.</p>
<p>What could you do? You could not fight them. You could not
kill them. They were an army with an uncanny and unnatural power.
Abbie looked out upon the devastation of the fields and the
garden upon which they both had worked so hard. The hot wind blew
over the ruins with Mephistophelean laughter. She looked up at
the cloudless blue,--huge, cruel, sardonic.</p>
<p>"God, . . . <i>you</i> ought to help," she cried aloud. "We
can't do it alone. <i>You</i> ought to help!"</p>
<p>All through August, Abbie went about in a dull, stupid way,
depressed by the last hard luck that had descended upon them and
the knowledge that her fourth child was coming. She was
nervous,--cross to Will and to the children. Sometimes, in a
temper, she jerked one of her little tots by the arm or spanked
one angrily,--figuratively standing off and looking at her own
actions in contempt. She seemed doing things she did not want to
do, seeing a nervous, cross woman, who was not herself, allow her
love for husband and babies to begin slipping. The song in
Abbie's throat was stilled that summer and not even an echo of
the melody lingered on. For the first time she was sorry about
her condition, sorry and bitter. One more mouth to feed, she said
to herself acridly,--she, who was a born mother. And then, in a
sudden revulsion of feeling at her disloyalty to motherhood, she
thought, "Oh, I don't want to feel that way about a child. I
ought <i>not</i> to say that . . . I won't . . . I <i>never</i>
will again."</p>
<p>In the letter which came in time from her sister Mary, was the
comforting word, "Well, Abbie, you ought to have married Dr. Ed
Matthews. His wife was here visiting this summer and she had fine
clothes,--a purple silk dress and a little lavender velvet bonnet
with pansies on and the widest satin strings, and lavender silk
mitts. She has a Paisley shawl, too, and a big cameo
breast-pin."</p>
<p>Abbie let the letter fall into her lap and sat thinking of Ed
Matthews in New York. Occasionally some one had written an item
about him. "Ed Matthews and his bride came to visit. She is an
eastern girl, and tremendous stylish." And later: "They say Ed is
in a New York hospital where they have as many as fifty
beds."</p>
<p>And now sitting there with the hot wind blowing over the
stripped fields, Abbie's thoughts went back to the knoll near the
Big Woods. "You're wonderful, Abbie! You're gorgeous! You
coquette! I'll take you with me. You can study all you want . . .
with the best teachers. . . ."</p>
<p>If she had known--if she could have foreseen--the drouth and
the grasshoppers,--the blizzards and the winds that were never
still--the hard work,--and the privations,--the song that might
never be sung,--the four babies in eight years. "No. . . . No!"
She pulled herself out of the dream. "No. . . . No! Don't let me
think it. Don't let me <i>think</i> of thinking it. It's wicked.
There's nobody but Will. It's just the crop failures and the
terrible hard luck that made me think it. Those things have
nothing to do with love." But even as she said it, Abbie knew
that it was not true. Abbie knew that unless you are very strong,
those things have something to do with love.</p>
<p>In an overwhelming return of affection for the children, she
picked little John up and covered him with kisses, her tears on
his cheeks. She drew Margaret to her and cuddled her, too.
Margaret's little hand had a dingy rag around it to cover a cut,
and in an ecstasy of mother-emotion, Abbie kissed the little
hand, kissed the plump baby neck between the soft brown ringlets
and the colorless calico dress. She went to the door and called,
"Mack, come in."</p>
<p>"What do you want, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Mack, . . . nothing but to kiss you, darling. Oh,
little son, I love you so. Kiss Mother, Mack."</p>
<p>Mack, who was seven now and a little superior to the
demonstration of women folks, stood the ordeal with fortitude and
then pulled quickly away. "I'm helping Father sort things, . . .
all the nails for him, . . . the little ones, . . . and the
horseshoe ones, . . . and . . ."</p>
<p>"That's it. That's a good boy. <i>Always</i> help Father,
Mack. He's the <i>best</i> father in the world. You'll never
forget it, will you, darling?"</p>
<p>She did not want Will to know what Mary had written, so she
read the letter aloud to him, blithely skipping the tart
reference to Ed Matthews.</p>
<p>During that summer the whole family went in the wagon along
the creek to scour the thickets for wild grapes and wild plums.
Abbie rode three miles on horseback to a Mrs. Tomlinson's to get
some late pieplant which had miraculously escaped the scourge of
the robber insects. And when Will came in one day with two huge
beets which he had found when taking down a pile of boards, Abbie
sent word to Henry Lutz's to come over and the two families
feasted on potatoes, corn bread and sliced boiled beets.</p>
<p>Every one was in want. In the early fall people began going
past the house. "Going home," they all reported. Many times
parties of them stayed all night. They had their own quilts and
would arrange their beds on the main-room floor. They were
beaten, they said. One could stand a few disappointments and
failures, but when everything turned against one, there was no
use trying to fight.</p>
<p>"The land hasn't turned against us," Will would argue
stubbornly. "It's the finest, blackest loam on the face of the
earth. The folks that will just stick it out. . . . You'll see
the climate change, . . . more rains and not so much wind . . .
when the trees grow. We've got to keep at the trees. Some day
this is going to be the richest state in the union . . . the most
productive. I'll bet anything next year . . ."</p>
<p>Always "next year"! It was a mirage, thought Abbie, an
apparition that vanished when one came to it. Six times now they
had said, "Next year, the crops will be fine."</p>
<p>And so she could not throw off the blue mood that had
descended upon her, a horde of worries that had come upon her
even as the horde of grasshoppers had come upon the land. The
thought that there was nothing to do with; that they could
scarcely keep body and soul together; that she probably would
never be able now to do anything with her voice; that another
child was coming,--they all harassed and tormented her. All fall
there was in her mind a tired disinterest over things. In spite
of what he said, that surface courage which he pretended had
returned to him. Abbie detected that Will, too, was morose. To
her keen eye he seemed dull and stoical, underneath an assumption
of cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Before cold weather, the old grasshoppers were gone, but first
they had taken infinite pains to leave a reminder of themselves
in the newly broken prairie everywhere,--holes the size of lead
pencils in which they laid one to two dozen eggs in a sack. In a
six-inch square of ground, Will testing their number, found a
double handful of the next year's hatching. There seemed not even
a hope for the following crop.</p>
<p>It was in November that the barrel and box came from the folks
back home. Will drove up to the soddie with rattling announcement
of their arrival. A letter from Grandpa Deal had been the
forerunner of the donations and already Abbie knew that an old
brass horn of Dennie's was among the things for Mack. She
determined to slip it out without his knowledge and put it away
for Christmas. They all gathered around the barrel while Will
pried open the top, Mack and Margaret dancing about in an ecstasy
of excitement. The first thing to be taken out was an envelope
marked "For Abbie," in Grandpa Deal's handwriting. In it was
twenty dollars. Abbie cried a little, tears of love and
homesickness, happiness and relief, and put it away with secret
thoughts of the desired organ. She sensed that Grandpa had
slipped it in with his one hand the last thing, so Grandma would
not see it.</p>
<p>There were flower seeds and sugar and beans, seed-corn and
dried apples in the barrel. Mother Mackenzie had tied and sent
two thick comforts. Regina Deal sent an old soiled white silk
bonnet with a bead ornament and a cluster of three little pink
feathers on it,--"tips," Abbie told the children they were,--and
a pair of dirty white "stays" and some old white hoop-skirts.
Abbie laughed until she cried at the sight of them.</p>
<p>"Maybe I could put the hoops over some stakes next summer and
keep the setting hens in them," she suggested. She put them on
over her work dress, the hoops and the stays both, and perched
the dirty bonnet on her red-brown hair, dancing about in them,
the three noble tips nodding with uncertain dignity as though,
like their former owner, they had no sense of humor. She pushed
Will and Mack and Margaret into position for a square dance and
showed the children how to "whirl your partner" and "alamand
left." The four of them pranced around in the impromptu dance,
the children in their patched dingy clothing, Will in his denim
work things, and Abbie in the foolish soiled cast-offs which
Regina had sent with so little thought. The two older children
laughed and clapped their hands and shouted that they had never
had so much fun in their lives, and little John toddled in and
out and between them in an ecstasy of bubbling spirits.</p>
<p>It broke something in Abbie, some tight-bound band around her
heart and throat, which had not been loosed for months. She hid
the old brass horn of Dennie's in the bedroom. She put away the
precious dried apples and pop-corn, the seed-corn and the big
solid Greenings from the orchard behind Grandpa Deal's house. She
hugged the huge warm quilts as though they were the fat
pudding-bag body of Maggie Mackenzie. The bad luck was temporary.
They were young and well. The children were all healthy
youngsters. Why, how wicked she had been! She was only
twenty-seven. She mustn't let her voice rust the way she had done
this summer. In another year or so she could have an organ and
maybe even get to a music teacher. She mustn't let youth slip
away and her voice go with it. She was ashamed of herself that
she had not sung for months.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh! the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Her voice rose full-throated, mellowed now with tribulations
and sympathy. The children clapped their hands that Mother was
singing.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Beautiful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She replenished the fire of twisted hay and corn-cobs in the
stove with the four holes and the iron hearth in front. She
cooked cornmeal mush for supper and set the table. Several times
she sang the same verses over.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Many a wooer sought her hand,<br>
For she had gold and she had land,"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>The teakettle sang and the children chattered happily at the
window. She lighted the coal-oil lamp with the red flannel in the
bowl and washed her hands in the tin basin. The prairie twilight
came on. The winds died down.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Everything at her command,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Will came in from doing the chores.</p>
<p>"It's the nicest time of day . . . isn't it, Will . . . the
red fire of the corn . . . and the steaming teakettle . . .
supper ready . . . and the children all alive and well . . . and
you and I together?"</p>
<p>Will put his arm around her for a brief, rare moment.</p>
<p>"It's the nicest time of day, Abbie-girl."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c14" id="c14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, the coming of the barrel seemed to put something back
into Abbie which had been gone temporarily,--laughter and hope,
courage and faith. She began planning right away for Christmas.
Mack was nearly eight, Margaret six and little John two. They
were going to have the finest Christmas they had ever known. To
Abbie's pleasure, Will entered into the preparations, too. He was
as glad to see Abbie come to life as she was to see him throw off
a little of his moroseness.</p>
<p>She told Gus and Christine Reinmueller their plans.</p>
<p><i>"Ach!"</i> Christine snorted. "So? <i>Gans närrich . .
.</i> voolish."</p>
<p>"A hell of a Christmas we'll have," was Gus's equally
enthusiastic response.</p>
<p>But Abbie found sympathy in Sarah Lutz,--Sarah, with her
little black beady eyes and her cheerful, energetic way.</p>
<p>"You know, Sarah, I think every mother owes it to her children
to give them happy times at Christmas. They'll remember them all
their lives. I even think it will make better men and women of
them."</p>
<p>"I think so, too, Abbie. We're going to have a cedar tree
hauled up from the Platte. Henry can get you one, too."</p>
<p>All day long Abbie worked at the tasks that demanded
attention, washing, ironing, patching, mending, baking, churning,
caring for the chickens,--all with meager equipment or no
equipment at all. Two wooden tubs, three heavy, clumsy
flat-irons, a churn with wooden dasher, scissors, needles and
thread, and a baking board with a few heavy dishes and utensils.
But from them, clean clothes, sweet butter, neatly made-over
suits and dresses and food that was palatable. The tapering
Mackenzie fingers were calloused and burned and pricked. As tired
as all these tasks left her, she would get the children to bed
early and then bring out the Christmas things and begin working
on them.</p>
<p>She got out the precious paints Mrs. Whitman had given her and
worked on a picture for Will when he was away. It was a scene of
the prairie with a clump of cottonwoods in the foreground. She
tried to get the afterglow of the sunset but even though she
worked faithfully, she could not get it. "If I only had some one
to help a little," she would say. "Some day I want to take some
painting lessons again. If I could just make a picture as I want
to,--it would satisfy something in me."</p>
<p>From the barn she got clean husks and made a family of dolls
for Margaret. She made the bodies, heads and limbs from the husks
and braided the corn-silk for hair. A man, a lady and a baby, she
made, and dressed them in corn-husk clothes. Will built a small
bedstead for them. Out of one of the coats in the barrel she made
Mack a new suit and concocted a bonnet for Margaret out of the
old one Regina had sent, trimming it with a little wisp of the
pink tips. With her paints, she marked off a checkerboard for
Mack, and Will whittled checkers from the circumference of some
small cottonwood branches. She cut a pattern and made a calico
dog for little John, stuffing it with corn-husks, and covering it
with knotted ends of carpet rags to give it a woolly appearance.
She ironed out brown wrapping paper, tied the pieces with yarn
and drew waggish-looking cows and horses on it for him, too.</p>
<p>Margaret laboriously hemmed a handkerchief for her father and
Mack made him a box for his newspapers. There was a State Journal
now, and as scarce as money was, Will had subscribed. "We can't
drop out of touch with other parts of the country," he had said.
"And we must know what the rest of the settlers are doing."</p>
<p>The children could talk of nothing but the approach of the
wonderful day. The word "he" had only one meaning in their
vocabulary,--a portly gentleman with a white beard and a sack on
his back.</p>
<p>"Are you sure he'll come this year, Mother? Heinie Reinmueller
said he wouldn't. He said his mother said so."</p>
<p>"Of <i>course</i> he'll come," Abbie assured the three.
"Because Father and I are making things, too, to help him when he
comes."</p>
<p>With Scotch-Irish cleverness, she could think of a dozen
things to do with her meager supplies to add to the festivities.
She ran tallow in tiny molds for the candles. She made a little
batch of molasses candy and baked cookies in star and diamond
shapes. She boiled eggs and painted faces on them and made little
calico bonnets for them.</p>
<p>Christine was contemptuous toward the unnecessary
festivities.</p>
<p>"For dot . . . no time I haf. You learn 'em vork . . . cows
milk 'n' pigs svill . . . 'n' dey for foolishness no time
haf."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't let us ever get like Reinmuellers," Abbie said.
"We're poor. If we were any poorer we might as well lie down and
give up. But we can fight to keep civilized . . . can fight to
keep something before us besides the work."</p>
<p>On the day before Christmas the snow lay deep on the prairie
and the children's greatest anxiety was whether "he" would find
the little house which was half buried. Margaret, with the
characteristic ingenuity of the female of the species, suggested
tying a piece of bright cloth where "he" would notice it. And
Mack, with the characteristic daring of the less deadly of the
same, got on top of the low house via a crusty snow bank and tied
one of little John's red flannel shirts to the stove-pipe.</p>
<p>At lamp-lighting, they all hung up their stockings, even Will
and Abbie. The children were beside themselves with excitement.
By their parents' stockings they put the little presents they had
made for them. They danced and skipped and sang. They cupped
their eyes with their hands, pressing their faces to the little
half-window and looking out into the night. The gleam of the
stars was reflected in the snow, and the silence of the sky was
the silence of the prairie.</p>
<p>"I see the Star."</p>
<p>"So do I. Right up there."</p>
<p>"It looks like it was over a stable."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. It looks like it was over a manger-stable."</p>
<p>"Now it looks like it's stopping over us."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, it looks like it's stopping right over <i>our</i>
house."</p>
<p>Wide-eyed, they went to bed. The three faces in a row on the
pillows, with the patchwork quilts tucked under the chins, were
flushed with anticipation.</p>
<p>"Always keep the Christmas spirit going," Abbie told them.
"Promise me, that when you get big and have homes of your own,
you'll keep the Christmas spirit in your homes."</p>
<p>"We will," they promised in glib and solemn accord.</p>
<p>When at last they slept, Will brought in the little cedar
tree. The morning found it trimmed with popcorn and tallow
candles. And a marvelous flock of butterflies had settled upon
it. Their bodies were of dried apples dipped in sugar and their
antennæ were pink and feathery, looking surprisingly as though
they had once adorned Regina Deal's bonnet. Will had made and
painted Abbie a corner what-not with four shelves, secreting it
in the stable behind some straw bedding. And he had constructed a
monstrous hobby-horse for the children, the body and head of
cottonwood chunks, real horse's hair for mane and tail, reins and
a bit in the steed's cut-out mouth. The wooden horse of Troy
never looked so huge. And then the old brass horn was
unwrapped.</p>
<p>"I'm so excited," Mack said, in solemn ecstasy. "I'm so
excited . . . my legs itch."</p>
<p>Historians say, "The winter of 'seventy-four to 'seventy-five
was a time of deep depression." But historians do not take little
children into consideration. Deep depression? To three children
on the prairie it was a time of glamour. There was not much to
eat in the cupboard. There was little or no money in the father's
flat old pocketbook. The presents were pitifully homely and
meager. And all in a tiny house,--a mere shell of a house, on a
new raw acreage of the wild, bleak prairie. How could a little
rude cabin hold so much white magic? How could a little sod house
know such enchantment? And how could a little hut like that
eventually give to the midwest so many influential men and women?
How, indeed? Unless, . . . unless, perchance, the star <i>did</i>
stop over the house?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c15" id="c15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a great deal of suffering among the settlers. It was
extremely cold. The government issued flour and beans and some
army clothes left over from war days. A supply came to the Lutz
store and Will took advantage of the offer of the flour, but only
after some protest of pride.</p>
<p>"I don't want to, Abbie,--like beggars."</p>
<p>"Will Deal,--from your government, after you fought to keep it
going!"</p>
<p>In the Lutz store, one day later, Abbie met Mrs. Tomlinson
from Poor Man's Hollow. She had on one of the blue army coats and
a pair of men's coarse army shoes.</p>
<p>Word came from back home that Grandpa Deal was very sick,--the
disease which had caused his arm's amputation, had broken out
again.</p>
<p>A few weeks later in the winter, Grandpa Lutz, Henry's and
Oscar's old father, died. Homesick for the neat Michigan farm and
a sight of lake water, uncomplaining, gently, he died. And once
more the settlers stood around an irregular hole in the ground on
the Lutz knoll of land where little Dan lay.</p>
<p>With scarcely a fortnight's passing, a letter came from Louise
Deal telling of Grandpa Deal's death, too. In a winter of intense
cold, little to eat, a dubious outlook for the future, and the
worry of Abbie's pregnancy, the news of kind Grandpa Deal's death
seemed too much to bear.</p>
<p>"I sat by his bed and Ma was mending stockings over by the
window where the light was," Louise wrote. Yes, Grandma Deal
would not want to be wasting any of the daylight, thought Abbie,
as she read with tear-dimmed eyes. "He said, 'Sis!' . . . you
know he sometimes called me that. . . 'Sis, how do you reckon
it'll be, all gold and wings and harps and pearly gates? No
meadows and lane roads and maple sap running and honey-locusts
and young corn growing . . . and no jokes?' I told him I didn't
know, and then in a little while he nodded his head over to where
Ma was sitting and said, 'Sis, it'll be mighty lonesome sittin'
around waitin' for her.' And when I looked at him again he was
dead."</p>
<p>Abbie could not see the rest of the letter for the tears. She
had loved Will's old father.</p>
<p>The winter seemed nothing but snow and cold, trouble and
misery. Only the children were happy. Too young to sense the
desperate straits of the family, they played joyfully through the
winter and worked cheerfully at the little tasks assigned
them.</p>
<p>It was cold and rainy through March and part of April. And
then spring came. Spring on the prairie, with the teal flying out
of the coarse grass, with the willow and the cottonwood and the
elders over by Stove Creek bursting into green joyousness, with
sweet-William and blue phlox, mousetail and wild indigo nosing up
through the sod, with the odor of loam and sub-soil coming over
the low rolling hills on the wings of every breeze, with the
white clouds scudding low with the wind, and with hope, which
springs eternal.</p>
<p>To Abbie the winter had seemed one nightmare of trouble and
one endless toot on an old cornet. Out of the hoarse and
heterogeneous collection of sounds, Mack had evolved the faint
semblance of two tunes. But the noisy affair had its advantage,
for when he began herding hogs on the prairie, its guttural
sounds assured her that he was all right.</p>
<p>It was hard for Abbie to put in the garden. Nature did not
mean to have a woman bend to severe tasks at such a time. Mack
and Margaret did a great deal of it under her supervision. Mack,
with his eight years, could hoe the rows, and Margaret, with her
six, could drop and cover the seeds. Even little John, who was
nearly three, wanted to "d'op 'em in," but as he had a wild and
superior disregard for keeping various seeds separate, he was
persuaded to make mud pies at the edge of the patch.</p>
<p>The Lutz store distributed government seeds and Will went
hopefully to his spring planting. But first he tried hard to get
rid of the young grasshoppers on his wheat acreage by laying long
rows of straw across the fields into which the infant
grasshoppers crawled for warmth. He then set fire to the straw
and destroyed a portion in that way. With the other men of the
neighborhood, he disposed of a countless number of the pests to
the government for two dollars a bushel. Never was money more
thankfully received.</p>
<p>The small grain came up with much promise. More grasshoppers
hatched, small as little gray-green flies, and promptly ate it
up.</p>
<p>In spite of the desperately hard times, Henry Lutz seemed able
to buy another eighty. He paid one thousand dollars for the
eighth-section, a nice acreage lying south of the young
Cedartown. Incidentally, his heirs sold it many years later for
twenty thousand dollars.</p>
<p>All the neighbors now joined the Grange, a union of farmers,
which some fondly thought would better conditions. It met in the
schoolhouse, where there was a great deal of talk without much
result, and where the women formed an auxiliary. Because of her
condition, Abbie did not join, but she helped Sarah Lutz sew the
regalia,--red calico robes, a cross between a cardinal's
vestments and a Mother-Hubbard, which were to be tied with white
sashes. Sarah told Abbie confidentially that she was
<i>Pomona,</i> and young Mrs. Oliver Johnson was <i>Minerva</i>
and that Christine had been <i>Scylla,</i> but when they assigned
her the name she thought they said "Silly," and had straightway
announced that even if she couldn't understand English very well,
she knew when she was called names, and departed in high
dudgeon.</p>
<p>In May, two young men stopped at the house just before dusk.
They were driving six hundred sheep from the Ozark Mountains
through to Cozad, which lay beyond the hundredth meridian on the
edge of the country known as the Great American desert.</p>
<p>They were fine, upstanding fellows in their early twenties,
the nephew of the editor of the Boston <i>Transcript,</i> and a
chum. The uncle had just died the previous December and left the
nephew five hundred dollars. With an equal amount of money the
friend had joined him and formed a partnership. Besides the
sheep, their chattels seemed to consist of a wagon, three small
horses, a coffee-pot and a skillet.</p>
<p>They made camp for the night a little to the north and east of
the Deal place, taking from the wagon a collapsible corral
consisting of yards and yards of muslin, one end of which they
tied to the wagon wheel and then used stakes driven into the
ground for temporary fence-posts around which to wrap the
muslin.</p>
<p>After the children were in bed, the young fellows came to the
house and talked with Will, but Abbie stayed in the bedroom. The
next morning they went on to add their fine young courage and
energy to the building of the state.</p>
<p>Only a few mornings later, Abbie sent Margaret out with the
old dog to call Will in from the field, and told Mack to take
John up to Reinmuellers. When Will came hurriedly in, he
unhitched, threw a saddle on old Bird and rode over after Dr.
Hornby. Sarah Lutz came riding out with the doctor in his cart
and Christine came down, too. The baby was born in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Abbie, relaxing, was filled with that age-old gratitude that
her ordeal was over. Peace enveloped her,--peace and relative
ease. Her fourth child! How queer! Well, she would love it and
care for it tenderly. Looking out in the other room she could see
Will and the doctor, Christine and Sarah all close together. They
were whispering. It seemed silent out there,--too silent,--a
whispering silence. A great fright seized her, so that she raised
herself up and called sharply, "Will!"</p>
<p>Will turned and came quickly into the bedroom.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Will? I can tell there's something the
matter."</p>
<p>Will took Abbie's hand. "It was a little son, Abbie."</p>
<p><i>"'Was,'</i> Will? Not . . . not . . . ?"</p>
<p>"He didn't live, Abbie-girl."</p>
<p>"Oh . . . no . . . no!" She broke into wild sobbing. "Oh, God,
not that. He's all right, Will. Go see if he isn't all right. My
babies are always all right."</p>
<p>But when Will did not go and only tried to quiet her, she had
to believe it. She was inconsolable. "Will, it was because I
didn't want him at first."</p>
<p>And when he tried to reason with her, she would not listen. "I
know better than any one. I'm punished. I didn't tell anybody.
But I was bitter. And now I've lost my baby." In her whole life
Abbie Deal never cried so wildly.</p>
<p>Sarah Lutz dressed him,--Sarah, with her black beady eyes
softened with tears. And then she brought him in,--a beautifully
formed child with a face like a tiny white rose. Abbie wanted him
beside her, wanted to hold him.</p>
<p>"My baby . . . he's so cold, Will. I never had a cold baby. I
want him to be warm." She did not talk rationally. "I hate death
and I'm afraid of it. But I <i>did</i> want him, Will. After a
while I wanted him. It was just at first." Rachel, who lives
again in every grieving mother, was crying for her child and
would not be comforted. And when she had worn out her hysteria
and quieted, she said she wanted him to have a name. "Basil,
Will,--after my father." Sarah came in and smoothed her hair,
talked to her gently, and said they were going to take him over
and put him by Dannie and Grandpa Lutz.</p>
<p><i>"Ach!"</i> Christine came in and clucked her sympathy. "A
boy, too! With the land he should help."</p>
<p>Abbie turned her face to the wall. Christine had no finer
feelings. She lay and thought of her sister Janet and her dead
baby. She could hear the faint pound, pound, of a hammer out at
the barn. Every hammer stroke hit her heart. They were going to
take the baby over to the Lutz burial knoll. There was no one
there but Dannie and Grandpa Lutz. Dannie . . . Grandpa Lutz . .
. and now little Basil Deal . . . three to make a cemetery. In a
new country you had to make homes and roads and wells and schools
. . . and you had to make a cemetery. You couldn't get around it
. . . you had to make a cemetery, too.</p>
<p>She lay there and thought of the knoll and the prairie grass
and the low picket fence against which the tumble-weeds piled . .
. where the blackbirds wheeled and the sun beat down and the wind
blew. She hated the barrenness of it. If she could put him in a
shady place it wouldn't be quite so hard. But to put him in the
sun and the coarse grass and the wind! She and Sarah would go
over and plant some trees some day. She heard the rattle of the
lumber-wagon and raised herself up to look through the little
half-window set in the sod. She could see Will and Sarah in the
wagon. Will was driving, and Sarah had a little wooden box across
her lap. When the big lumber-wagon rattled away from the house,
Abbie lay back on her pillow. For a long time she could hear the
sound of the lumber-wagon rattling over the prairie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c16" id="c16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It was several weeks before Abbie could get around again to do
all her work. Christine or Sarah came over and helped a little
each day. Service finds its greatest opportunity and its least
begrudged hours of labor among neighbors in a new community
through which lines have not been drawn and into which class has
not yet come.</p>
<p>Abbie could not get over the loss of her little son. Always
she saw him in shadowy outline among the others. All her life she
was to say, "Now he would be seven," "To-day he would be twelve,"
"He could have voted to-day for the first time." Yes, Abbie Deal
was a born mother,--one of those women who love the touch of baby
flesh, who cuddle little children to them, who, when their own
babies have grown, catch up some other woman's child to
fondle.</p>
<p>On the day in June in which Abbie did her first full day's
work, the grasshoppers lifted their wings and flew to other
fields,--as complete and unified a departure as their coming had
been.</p>
<p>There was no small grain that summer, but a half-hearted corn
crop seemed on the way. Settlers by the score were returning
east. Scarcely a day passed which did not see some forlorn group
go by the house. Many of the covered wagons carried statements
painted on their wagons, which would have been humorous if they
had not been so tragic. "Going back to Pa and Ma," was one.
Another held a huge caricature of a grasshopper strangling a man
with its forelegs and antennæ, and the laconic words, "He
wins."</p>
<p>Abbie, standing at the door and watching one of these
bedraggled-looking outfits pass, said bitterly to Will, "When do
you think our time is coming? Look at the clouds, Will. Even the
clouds seem always going east."</p>
<p>Will did not answer. He turned on his heel and went down to
the straw-covered dug-out which served as a barn. Watching him
go, in his faded blue shirt and overalls with their many
patchings, and his dingy old hat, Abbie called to her mind the
fine figure he had made in his wedding suit,--fine enough to draw
the attention of any exacting young woman. Ten years ago! And the
minister at home had said you could do anything with your life.
But that was not so. Life did things to you. Ten years! Small
wonder that love would break under circumstances like these.
Standing there in the soddie door, she seemed two personalities.
One argued bitterly that it was impossible for love to keep going
when there was no hope for the future, suggested that there was
no use trying to keep it going. The other said sternly that
marriage was not the fulfillment of a passion,--marriage was the
fulfillment of love. And love was sometimes pleasure and
sometimes duty.</p>
<p>"You traitor," she said suddenly to herself, "You Judas! As
though hard luck could kill my love for Will! Will's not to
blame. It's a fine love that a little bad luck can smother! It
can't touch it . . . it can't. Love is the light that you see by.
It's all in the world we've got to light our way, and it takes
both of us to keep it bright. And I'm not doing my share . . .
I'm not. I'm glum and sad and discouraged. And I'm not going to
be any more. There are only two things that can help us,--and
that's our courage and our love. From this very minute on I'm
going to try to cheer Will up more. I'm through being
downhearted."</p>
<p>She turned to the children. They were all around the table
looking at a little picture Margaret had drawn. Margaret was
always drawing. Abbie ran to them, closed warm maternal arms
around all three, and bumped them together in a return of girlish
spirits, so that they laughed at her unusual playfulness, their
faces sparkling because Mother was full of fun. How readily they
responded to all her moods. And how careful she must be with
those childish impressions.</p>
<p>"You shall wear them, Margaret," she kissed her little
daughter, "you shall wear them yet."</p>
<p>"Wear what, Mother?"</p>
<p>"The pearls."</p>
<p>"What are pearls, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Wait . . . I'll show you."</p>
<p>She got it from under the bed,--the old calf-skin box, and the
children gathered close with excited anticipation. She took the
pearls out and ran them through her fingers.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother . . . the pretty beads!" Margaret's gray eyes
glowed.</p>
<p>"Shucks, I'd rather have a watch," from the masculine Mack.
Little John was not even interested.</p>
<p>Abbie laughed and held them up, their creamy luster
inappropriate against her work-worn hand. She put them around
Margaret's little sunburned neck, and they hung down over the
dingy gray calico dress with incongruous comparison.</p>
<p>"You shall wear them, darling. Some day you shall. We're going
to make it come true. We've <i>got</i> to make it come true." She
caught Margaret to her. "It takes faith and courage and love and
prayer and work and a little singing to keep up your spirits, but
we're going to do it."</p>
<p>In September, Mack and Margaret started to school to a little
new one-roomed frame building which some one already had
christened the Woodpecker School. Little Emma Lutz started, too,
and two more of the Reinmueller boys,--Christine's idea being
that it would be a good thing for them to know how to write their
names, at least, and figure up bushels. On good days the children
trudged the long grassy way, and on bad days, Will stopped his
work long enough to take them in the wagon. Abbie shed copious
tears the first morning they started, and then laughed at her own
inconsistency.</p>
<p>"I wanted them to have a school closer than Sodom to go to,
and then I cry when they do have," she said to Will. But Will
said he knew how she felt. Will was always so understanding,
Abbie thought gratefully.</p>
<p>That winter of '76 and '77 was another one of great hardship,
but like many things in life, it had its pleasant side. A reading
circle was formed and met at Woodpecker School every Friday
night. Its members wore ribbon badges upon which Sarah Lutz and
Abbie had printed the mysterious letters "S.C.L.R.C," which, when
the mystery was eliminated, were discovered to stand for the
title of Stove Creek Precinct Literary Reading Circle. The
membership was divided, like all Gaul, into three parts, and if
there were not Belgians, Helvetians and Germans who fought and
bled, at least, the "Reds," the "Blues," and the "Yellows" met in
forensic frays. On one Friday night the "Reds" performed, the
next two Fridays the "Blues" and "Yellows" respectively, and on
the fourth Friday night a big contest was staged, in which the
star members of the various colors mingled in one grand rainbow
spectrum, with people imported from outside the precinct sitting
in judgment upon the efforts. That winter the schooner
<i>Hesperus</i> was wrecked, little Paul Dombey died, Hamlet met
his father's ghost and the Raven quothed more times than there
were meetings,--new "pieces" being at a premium, as they
were.</p>
<p>Whole families came, ensconced on straw in the bottom of
wagon-boxes which had been put upon bob-sleds. Every one brought
heated soap-stones or hot flat-irons, as more than one load came
from twenty miles away. The Henry Lutzes brought their reed-organ
in the sleigh each time, so there was always music. Abbie was put
on for a group of songs whenever the "Blues" performed, and
always led the chorus singing. "Three Blind Mice" and "Scotland's
Burning" were the favorite rounds. As for the favorite choruses,
while great partiality was shown toward "Juanita," "Annie Laurie"
and "Revive Us Again," for sheer volume there was nothing like
"Pull For the Shore" to open the throttle. Young blades who could
not carry a tune were filled with an irresistible impulse to sing
whenever the life-line was brought out, and when the sailors
began to make more rapid progress toward the lighthouse, they
would grab oars, as it were, open their mouths and bellow like
young steers.</p>
<p>In September of 1877, Abbie gave birth to a girl. The high
bleating cries of the child were music to the mother who could
never erase from her mind the misery of that whispering silence
of two years before. They named the little girl Isabelle. "Maybe
<i>she'll</i> be the lovely lady," Abbie thought as she ran her
fingers through the tiny moist ringlets of reddish-brown
hair.</p>
<p>The first Sunday Abbie could get out, Will hitched up the
horses to the lumber-wagon, and they drove to the dedication of
the new frame church near the Lutz store. Henry Lutz had donated
the land, and a dollar collected here and another one there, had
bought the lumber which was hauled from Nebraska City. All the
men of the community for miles around had given their time for
the labor, and now a little unpainted church stood at the four
corners.</p>
<p>It had been nine years now since the Deal and Lutz and
Reinmueller wagons had first crawled across the prairie. A few
fences had appeared, and the old buffalo trail had begun to take
upon itself the semblance of a roadway. Tracks were plainly
visible, worn by the feet of a thousand oxen and horses and the
wide iron rims of the dingy prairie schooners. Between the trails
the grass still flaunted, and the graceful goldenrod nodded its
plumed head, as a queen bows when her subjects pass by. Sweet
William and blue phlox, mouse-tail and wild indigo crowded the
grass of the roadway, and when the tiny primrose was gone, yellow
and white mustard elbowed their way in to take the place.</p>
<p>The cottonwoods had shot up with unbelievable growth. The
leaves, with their peculiar double motion, seemed always
twinkling, always dancing. The silhouettes of the grayish-green
clumps against the prairie sky were Abbie's poetry and her
paintings, her sermons and her songs.</p>
<p>Cedartown now had its church and its school, its store and
blacksmith shop, and six houses assembled in the same vicinity.
And it had its cemetery, for Henry Lutz had given the community
the knoll where Dannie lay. There were seven mounds inside the
picket fence where herding stock could not trample. Yes, in a new
country you have to make a cemetery.</p>
<p>Crops were no better. They were put in each year with hope,
and they came up with promise. But the dry, fluffy clouds scudded
high across the blue sky without moisture, or the hot winds blew,
and the settlers would harvest a scant half-crop. In some way,
Will and Abbie held body and soul together. In some way, the
children seemed to get enough to eat and to thrive and grow.</p>
<p>In the fall of '79 a man with a violin case stopped at the
house and asked if he could have supper. He had been drinking,
and Will, contrary to his usual hospitable manner, talked with
him for some time before he decided to invite him to stay.</p>
<p>After the meal the guest took out the violin and played for
the family. The music seemed to steady him, for when he drew the
bow across the strings all the wild sweet bird songs of the
forest came from them. To Abbie, with her deep-worn love of
music, it was enchantment.</p>
<p>"Can you, . . ." she asked, when he had finished, "can you
play a song called 'The Lady of the Lea' . . . ?"</p>
<p>For answer, he drew the bow again and the melody came lightly,
delicately, hauntingly. Abbie had not sung it for four or five
years, but now she threw back her head and took the air to the
violin's accompaniment.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea,<br>
Fair and young and gay was she,<br>
Beautiful exceedingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>In the sod house with its cook-stove and the turned-over
boiler and the burning twisted hay, with its crude what-not and
its sod bed, its store-box book-shelves and its burlap floor
covering, she put into her voice all the longing of her heart,
all the vague hopes for the best that life could give her
children.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"For she had gold and she had land,<br>
Everything at her command,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>It was as though, through sheer force of will, she was trying
to make all the desires for her children's future come true,--all
her dreams for them turn to realities.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Dreaming visions longingly,<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"You have a good voice," the stranger said soberly. "You ought
to do something with it."</p>
<p>"There are lots of things one <i>ought</i> to do," Abbie
replied,--and looked over at Will to see whether he had detected
the bitterness which she had not been able to keep out of her
reply.</p>
<p>The man put his violin carefully, tenderly, into the case.
"It's a Stradivarius," he said. "A man in Omaha offered me six
hundred dollars for it."</p>
<p>Will looked up in surprise. "Offered you six hundred dollars .
. . for a fiddle?" It seemed a fortune. "And you mean you
wouldn't sell it?"</p>
<p>"No," said the man simply. "I couldn't. Thank you very much
for the supper." And he went, a little unsteadily, out of the
door.</p>
<p>Abbie walked over to the small-paned half-window set in the
sod, and looked out at the gray twilight coming across the
prairie. The winds that were never still blew past the house in
their unending flight.</p>
<p>How queer people were. All the folks in the new country were
hoarding things, hanging on to old heirlooms. They became their
symbols of refinement and culture. Sarah Lutz had a painting that
drew your eyes to it the minute you opened the door. Oscar Lutz's
wife had a pink quilted bedspread that she kept rolled up in
newspapers. Even Christine Reinmueller had a bright blue vase
with magenta-colored roses on it, standing up on top of the
cupboard. They stood for something besides the land and the corn
and the cattle. They must hang onto them, never lose them out of
their lives, for if lost, everything was lost. She must hang onto
the pearls and everything they stood for; Sarah must keep her
painting; Martha Lutz, her bedspread; Christine, her blue vase.
Else what was there in the future for the children?</p>
<p>"No," said Abbie aloud at the soddie window. "No, he couldn't
sell it."</p>
<p>For some time she stood there, watching the half-intoxicated
man go east across the prairie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c17" id="c17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The snow began in October that year and did not leave until
the last of March. Wherever there were fences, the drifts piled
high and obliterated them, so that one would not have known any
had been built,--Nature's little joke, as though she were
laughing at the settlers for their pains.</p>
<p>The children's attendance at school was broken constantly by
severe snowstorms, so that Abbie again did much of the teaching
herself. She often searched her mind for new ideas, trying to
think what more she could do for the children. Time was slipping
away and conditions were no better. Even if she must face the
hard fact that she could never do anything more for herself, the
children must have some of the best things of life. Will was
working day and night, making an old man of himself before his
time. <i>She</i> must do more for the children some way. She must
not let them grow up without a taste for good things. They ought
to know more about music and have more reading material, and
because they were not getting them, in some way she must instill
in them a <i>desire</i> to have them. They must never be
satisfied with things as they were. Even if she and Will were to
live in a soddie all their lives, cut off from those things, the
children must want to have them. If the desire were deep enough,
they would find a way to seek them out as they grew older.</p>
<p>She began getting down the Shakespeare plays for a while each
evening, and requiring Mack and Margaret to learn a passage or
two. Over and over she made them repeat:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"The quality of mercy is not strained<br>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
Upon the place beneath."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Or, perhaps:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>
Rough-hew them how we will."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Mack protested. "Aw, shucks, I don't see any sense to
them."</p>
<p>"It's for your own good, Mack," she would say. "Some day when
you're older, the meaning will all come to you. And you'll be
glad you've learned so much of them."</p>
<p>But Mack was more interested in his old brass horn. There was
a six-piece band over at Cedartown now, and that spring one often
heard the far-away blare of the three brass instruments, the toot
of the fife and the rumble of the two snare drums. The
organization was preparing for the first Fourth of July
celebration in the community and patriotic airs were as much in
evidence as the spring winds. Mack, herding hogs, would sit at
the western border of his father's land and windily blow out the
same tune which the band was practicing. As he was usually two
notes behind the others, his part in the proceedings sounded like
an echo. It began to bother the legitimate performers, so that,
more from sheer self-defense than enthusiastic desire, they
invited him to join them. Mack's round freckled face beamed at
the invitation as one receiving a congressional medal.</p>
<p>All masculine hands donated work that spring toward the
building of a small frame G. A. R. hall. It was completed in time
for the Fourth of July celebration and dedicated with much
oratory and a baked bean supper. Sarah and Martha Lutz and Abbie
had sewed yards and yards of unbleached muslin together to form
the top of a bowery, over which were placed branches cut from the
trees at the creek-bend and under which all the residenters
within a twenty-mile radius danced.</p>
<p>By 1880 the Deal land was all fenced. The fence was a
symbol,--man's challenge to the raw west. Every fence post was a
sign post. More plainly than flaunting boards, they said, "We
have enclosed a portion of the old prairie. We hold between our
wooden bodies the emblem of the progressive pioneer,--barbed
wire. We are the dividing line. We keep the wild out and the
domesticated within." The road, too, which followed the old
buffalo trail had been surveyed and straightened. Man's system
had improved upon the sinuously winding vagaries of the old
buffalo, and the road, although still grass-grown, ran straight
west past the house. The development of the road is the evolution
of the various stages of civilization.</p>
<p>But though man could fence the prairie and direct the way of
the road, he could not control the storm. "This far shalt thou go
and no farther," the God of the settlers seemed to say. Snows,
droughts, blizzards, dust storms, rains, hot winds and the little
pigmy people,--He held them all in the hollow of His hand.</p>
<p>On the seventeenth of April, the Deal family drove in the
lumber wagon across the prairie to attend the funeral service for
a distant neighbor. The day was warm and windy and disagreeable.
Little miniature whirlwinds of dust spiraled themselves ahead of
the team and the dry particles of dirt blew back in their faces.
As they rode, the wind grew in volume and the dust clouds
thickened with the rising of the wind. Before the fury of its
force great sheets of top-soil from the newly plowed fields were
lifted into the air and thrown with violence over the land. When
the family reached the schoolhouse, they found their neighbors
sitting there with dirt-blackened faces, almost unrecognizable.
The room was dense with dust-clouds, the little building
shivering in the onslaught of dirt. At one blast of wind more
severe than others, the minister paused in the midst of the
funeral eulogy and said, "There are times when it is wiser to
think of the living than to honor our loved dead. I think it
wiser that we disperse at once and drive to the cemetery."</p>
<p>Will and Abbie thought they could not get home through the
terrific storm. It was like swimming the waves of a dirty sea.
Abbie held Isabelle closely, and Mack and Margaret kept John's
hands in their own. In fear of colliding with some one, Will did
not drive the horses off a walk. Slowly they crawled over the
prairie, through the dense dust clouds, with only occasional
moments of the lifting of the dirt, in which Will, watching for
the road, would guide the blinded team back into the trail. The
storm was like a blizzard in its fury,--a black blizzard, with
grit and dust for snow, and with field dirt for the drifts
through which they drove. Eyes and ears were full of the gritty
earth particles, and at times it seemed that they would
suffocate. Then Will would stop the team for a rest, before
plunging again into the black whirlpool of dust.</p>
<p>At home again, Abbie thought she could not endure the sight
that met her eyes. Over the burlap floor-covering lay a soft
inch-thick carpet of dirt. Over the curtains and the beds lay the
same grimy substance. It floated on the water-pail and in the
milk in the cupboard. There was nothing in the house in condition
to eat and nothing that could be worn without washing. And so,
once more, the young pioneer mother bent to the task of fighting
the elements, to help make a home on the prairie.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that year, crops were good. There was an
indication of better times to come. Prices went up. Will and
Abbie began talking and planning about the new house. No, that is
not quite true,--<i>Abbie</i> began talking and planning about
the new house. It is the woman's prerogative. Mack was thirteen
now, Margaret eleven, John eight, and Isabelle three. They were
getting too old to be packed in like little chickens in a coop,
Abbie said. Every moment that was free from the ever-present hard
work, she sat with pencil and paper and drew plans for a
house.</p>
<p>"Even if it's just a few rooms at first," she would say to
Will, "they'll be nice, and we'll plan it so they can be added to
as time goes on. Can you think of anything grander, Will, than a
sitting-room, all with clean, new, white plaster, and a kitchen
that's built to be <i>handy,</i> and two upstairs bedrooms for
the older children?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to do it for you, Abbie-girl. Maybe we can, if I do
a lot of the work myself."</p>
<p>That summer they stopped at the J. Sterling Morton's as they
had often done, on their way to Nebraska City, and the visit
inspired them both to greater activity in making a better home.
The Morton house seemed the last word in grandeur with its bay
windows and real shingled roof, its fancy wall-paper and figured
carpet, its tidies on the backs of all the chairs and splashers
behind the wash-bowl and pitchers.</p>
<p>That fall and early winter, remarkable weather prevailed. It
was unusually warm. Migrating songsters stayed on,--the robins
and the bluebirds, the ph&oelig;bes and the red birds. Even an
occasional meadow-lark gave its June call in that wonderful
Indian summer. There was in the air that haze which is found
nowhere but in the midwest, and at no time but late fall when
winter loiters on its way,--that glamorous haze which is not air,
nor sunshine, nor smoke, but a little of all three,--air from
over the wild, free prairies, smoke from a thousand burning
weed-bends and brush fires, and sunshine filtered through the
sifting, shifting smoke and air. There was bronze on the clumps
of oaks along Stove Creek, red on the maples, yellow on the
cottonwoods, green in the late pastures, white clouds dipping
low, and over all, that haze, which is not smoke, nor air, nor
sunshine, but a little of all three.</p>
<p>In the last half of December the spell broke. The winds blew
over the prairie. Tumble-weeds from far out on the open, rushing
headlong before their terrific onslaught, piled up against the
fences and the little buildings. The leaves on the clumps of
trees by the creek blew into nowhere. The pickets around the
little cemetery caught and held a brown drift of leaves and
tumble-weeds. The birds scurried before the wind. The snows
came.</p>
<p>By Christmas the snow was fifteen inches deep on the level,
and crusted over,--a delicate shimmering steel, which held up men
and the lighter animals on its surface. Will could not get to
town with his team, but would walk over to the store with a sack
on his back. Snow-drifts were ten and fifteen feet deep. Days
were bright, sunshiny and zero at noontime. Nights were clear,
white-lighted, and twenty-two below.</p>
<p>All winter the deep snows held. On ranches farther west
thousands of cattle died. The spring found many of the ranchers
ruined. The snows melted and the streams ran high. Stove Creek
came half way up the pasture, and departing, left behind the slag
of the creek-bed.</p>
<p>When the weather settled, the Deals started the new house. And
Abbie Deal thought heaven could not hold more joy than the
planning of those five rooms. Will hauled stone from Louisville
and pine and cottonwood lumber from Nebraska City. And one day
when there was a sick cow and he could not leave, Abbie went
alone for the lumber. Old Asy Drumm came with his hammer and his
saw and his plug of tobacco, and watching him labor, one would
have thought there was some invisible mechanical connection
between his jaws and the other tools, so harmoniously did they
work.</p>
<p>"We'll have the sitting-room there and the kitchen here,"
Abbie told Asy. And old Asy, with few comments but much tobacco
chewing, placed the sitting-room there and the kitchen here. The
result was weatherproof and sturdy, but only in the light of
later years was it proven artless. Only to other than the eyes of
Abbie Deal did it ever appear devoid of artistry. To Abbie it was
always a thing of architectural beauty, for it was conceived from
love and desire in the days of her youth.</p>
<p>There were three rooms downstairs,--a sitting-room, a kitchen,
and a bedroom for Will, Abbie and little Isabelle. Up the
uncarpeted pine stairs was a room for Margaret, and one for Mack
and John.</p>
<p>"I've planned it so we can build on a room later right to the
front," Abbie would say. "Then, some day we can cut double doors
from the sitting-room into a new parlor."</p>
<p>The cedar trees, which Abbie had set out years before, had not
lived through the droughts. So now, they put out a new group,
nine on each side of a potential path leading up to the front of
the house. Lombardy poplars in a long row were set at right
angles to the main road, following the track to the barn which
Will's wagon had worn in the thirteen years. "It'll make a nice
shady lane road," Abbie would plan, "and some day we'll have the
white picket-fence." Yes, the real home was beginning to shape
itself.</p>
<p>In the middle of the summer they moved into the half-finished
house. They scarcely knew what to do with all the space. They
could not quite get used to the fact that the family of six could
spread itself out all over five rooms. After the old two-roomed
soddie, the simple, plain house seemed a palace. It represented a
big move forward. They were about to see daylight. After thirteen
years they were actually beginning to witness results. Trees were
commencing to give shade. Orchards were beginning to bear. Better
crops were being harvested and higher prices given. To Abbie it
seemed that for the first time they were really going to
live.</p>
<p>The Deal family was representative of other families, its
condition indicative of state conditions. The western half of the
state began to be settled. The old range cattle ranches were
practically finished. The "grain farmer" was moving in. Wagons
again passed the Deal home, going west this time. Prairie
schooners once more crawled over the old buffalo trail, pushing
on now to the grassy valleys which lay between the sand hills or
to the fertile plains beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c18" id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There were good crops again the next year. No longer did the
dry, fluffy clouds scud high across the blue. They gathered and
fell in a benediction of rains. And there were no hot winds. It
put courage and high hopes into every one. A great relief was in
Abbie's mind. There seemed something to live for, something ahead
for the family, at last.</p>
<p>Abbie had her house-yard fence now, so that the chickens could
not molest her flowers. Sea-blue larkspur and blood-red
hollyhocks flaunted their colors against the dazzling white of
the pickets. Flowers in the yard! No one but a rancher's wife,
who had lived in a soddie and up to whose door had come the pigs
and the calves and the chickens, could realize what it meant to
have a fenced house-yard with flowers.</p>
<p>Life was crowded with hard work for Abbie, but it was also
full of compensations. There were the children, well, capable,
bright.</p>
<p>Mack at fifteen was big, overgrown, with a round, freckled
face that reminded Abbie somehow of her mother's fat, placid one.
Mack made friends everywhere. He seemed to have that knack of
fitting in with every one. "It may stand him in good stead some
time," Abbie would say to Will. He lived the life of the typical
farm boy who had to work by the side of his father. With two old
coats, a cap, a muffler and overalls tucked into knee boots, he
froze in the winter hauling wood or caring for the stock. With a
hickory shirt, home-made pants, galluses and a flappy straw hat,
he roasted in the summer at the plowing or haying.</p>
<p>Margaret, thirteen, was always drawing. Her sleek dark braids
and gray eyes were bent above paper and pencil whenever she had
leisure time. The cottonwoods and the cedars, a bit of path
between the elderberry bushes, a spray of graceful
goldenrod,--she was always trying to get these down on paper.</p>
<p>John, ten now, gave evidence of being a replica of his father,
quiet, serious, uncomplaining, reminding Abbie of Will when he
was a boy. Isabelle gave promise of becoming the family beauty,
for although only seven, she was attractive with her
reddish-brown curls, her brown eyes and her fair skin,--and
always singing at her play in a clear childish voice. "My little
'lovely lady,'" Abbie used to say to herself. "How glad I am I
named her Isabelle."</p>
<p>It had been thirteen years since Abbie and Will had followed
the trail behind old Red and Baldy, and Abbie had not been back
home.</p>
<p>"You can come back to visit whenever you want to, I promise
you that, Abbie," Will had said. And she had not gone back once.
But she did not blame Will. He had been helpless to keep that
promise. And now this summer he said that she must go. All the
plans were made, with a new brown cashmere dress in the process
of construction. Abbie sang at her work, that after all these
years she was to go back home and see her mother and Belle, Janet
and Mary and the boys.</p>
<p>And then, Mack did not feel well. Dr. Hornby came and after
some time decided it was to be a run of fever,--typhoid. Abbie
put away the unfinished dress and hung over Mack's bed for weeks.
He pulled through, but by the time he was strong enough to be up,
the fall had come and the rains, so that the roads to Lincoln and
Nebraska City were impassable, and Abbie's plan for a trip back
home had gone into nothing.</p>
<p>It was only a few weeks later that Will came in from putting
up the team after a trip to Weeping Water and said: "Abbie, you
can get out your old paints. There's a woman in Weeping Water
just come from some place back east and they say she's a real
artist. They say she'll take some pupils and I told 'em my wife
was always wanting to try her hand . . ."</p>
<p>Abbie was already on her way to the calf-skin box under the
bed, with Margaret close behind her. When she had come out with
the chest and opened it, Margaret was still at her elbow, her
gray eyes wide with anticipation.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother,--I didn't know you had any paints now. You just
said you <i>used</i> to . . . Oh, Mother, <i>why</i> did you
never tell me?"</p>
<p>"Why did you want to know?"</p>
<p>The young girl's eyes were bright gray lights. "Oh, Mother . .
. I want to use them . . . I want to go and see that woman . . .
Oh, Mother . . . <i>something</i> in me . . ."</p>
<p>Will was cross. "That'll do, Margaret. You don't understand.
Before you were born, when your mother came out here, she wanted
to . . ."</p>
<p>"Will," said Abbie sternly, "hush! Of <i>course</i> you may
try them, Margaret. And we'll take you over to Weeping Water some
time to see the artist."</p>
<p>When Abbie left the room, Margaret did not even look up. She
was sorting the tubes in the little box, touching them lovingly
as one would touch jewels.</p>
<p>When Mack was seventeen, he went to Omaha with his father and
came back changed. He was through with farm life and he didn't
care who knew it. Will said he'd better settle down and get to
work and Mack said no, he wanted to get a job in Omaha. Will said
it was a boy's fool notion and Mack said it was nothing of the
kind, that he was almost eighteen and he knew what he wanted.
Never did Abbie feel so helpless to handle a situation, so
uncertain what to say or do.</p>
<p>"He doesn't want to sweat," Will told her with sarcasm. "He
wants to wear a white collar."</p>
<p>"What do you want to do up there?" Abbie was trying to keep
the conversation peaceful.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know just <i>what.</i> Get in somewhere and work
up."</p>
<p>"Get in <i>somewhere</i> . . . but <i>where</i> . . . and
what?" Will had no patience with the wild scheme.</p>
<p>"Anything that's where there's business and a big town . . .
anything but the farm."</p>
<p>And Will had said that the Deals had always been for the
land.</p>
<p>Abbie stood between them for days. "Oh, Will, don't you see?
The farm is distasteful to Mack."</p>
<p>"A farm has been good enough for smarter men than Mack."</p>
<p>"We don't all want to do the same thing, and Will, you said
you couldn't do anything just working for your father. You've
always been so understanding. Then try to understand Mack."</p>
<p>Abbie talked and prayed. "Oh, God, it's such little things we
need help in,--such every day affairs." She saw Will's
disappointment and she saw Mack's ambitions. Torn between the
two, she could only smooth matters over for both.</p>
<p>"Let him go, then," Will said suddenly, as one who could no
longer hold to his point. "But I wish to God, Margaret and
Isabelle had been boys. Maybe we could get something done around
here then." He slammed the kitchen door and went down to the
barn. Abbie, fighting back the tears, told herself that he didn't
mean it. Will loved his girls,--and he didn't mean it.</p>
<p>By fall Mack had a job in an Omaha bank. Henry Lutz knew one
of the officers well, and it was through him that Mack landed the
work which consisted in part of sweeping and dusting, but which
"beat plowing corn all to pieces," according to the wielder of
the broom and duster.</p>
<p>Abbie had thought she could not stand it to see Mack leave
home. All day long she had sewed shirts and mended socks for
him,--and all night she had stared into the dark with the worry
of her boy going to the city. But with the arrival of his
letters, some of her anxiety vanished. When at Christmas time he
came home to spend the day, he was full of "bank talk." One would
have gathered from his conversation that he was at least on the
board of directors.</p>
<p>In the spring of '85, the day which had been set aside by the
various governors for planting trees was legalized as a
holiday,--and J. Sterling Morton had given Arbor Day to Nebraska,
which, in turn, was eventually to give it to the other states.
That summer Abbie again planned the delayed trip back home.
Before she was ready word was noised about that an academy was to
open in Weeping Water in the fall. It was to have a full
three-year academic course preparing students for college, with
special attention to the languages.</p>
<p>"For what anybody two vays vant to talk . . . ?" Christine
asked.</p>
<p>"I felt like telling her no one could object if <i>she</i>
would stick to one way," Abbie told Will. Christine's language
was no better than when she had first arrived in the prairie
schooner. Quite often she used both the German and the English
words in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Emma Lutz, Margaret's chum, and a year younger, was going to
the academy. Henry and Sarah drove over to Weeping Water in their
high-topped buggy with the natural-colored maple wheels and a red
tassel on the whip, to get a place for Emma to board.</p>
<p>Abbie could think of nothing else when she heard it. An
academy! Margaret ought to go,--Margaret, at sixteen, with her
braids of soft dark hair, her big gray eyes, her gentle manner,
and her love of painting. She ought to have more schooling, to
meet more young people. Several times that summer Emil
Reinmueller had come over to take her to neighborhood socials. It
worried Abbie a little. Emil was nineteen, a blond young giant,
stolid, crude, virile. What if . . . ? "Thou art mated to a clown
and the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee
down," Abbie had read from Tennyson's <i>Locksley Hall.</i> Emil
was no mate for Margaret with her love of the niceties of life.
What could a mother do? What had <i>her</i> mother done? Nothing.
"I married the man I wanted," Abbie thought. What if Margaret,
with her high ideals and her painting talent--what if she should
suddenly turn and say, "Mother, I'm going to marry Emil." What
could one do? The worry of it was constantly with Abbie.</p>
<p>She began trying to plan how she could send Margaret to the
academy with little expense. The money for the trip back home
would pay the first tuition. Will did not like the idea. "You've
planned this trip for years. You ought not to give it up for her.
And she's just where she can really help you, now, at home." He
argued, "You've got yourself to think about."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I haven't," Abbie said quickly, "I've got the
<i>children</i> to think about."</p>
<p>He gave in, a little grudgingly. If Abbie thought she could
manage--And Abbie knew she <i>must</i> manage.</p>
<p>She took the team and drove the ten miles to Weeping Water.
When she came back, she had a place in the minister's family for
Margaret to work for her board, and a dress pattern of red and
gray plaid for best. It was all they could afford now, but on the
way home Abbie mentally made over Margaret's old dress and one of
her own, trimmed a hat, and relined a winter coat.</p>
<p>In the last half of the summer they tied two quilts, as
Margaret had to furnish her own bedding. They made over the
clothes in accordance with Abbie's previous brain convolutions,
mended cotton stockings, ironed out hair ribbons, made a
work-apron out of flour-sacking, and packed and repacked the
small trunk. Abbie could not think how the home would be without
Margaret. Quiet, gentle, fun-loving, ready to help, Margaret had
always been at her right hand.</p>
<p>Will was to take Margaret and Emma in the lumber-wagon, so the
trunks could go with them. Emma had several new dresses and a
dolman,--the latest thing in wraps. It was made of black watered
silk, waist length in the back and to the bottom of the skirt in
front, with cape-like appendages for sleeves, and rows of braid,
cord, beads and buttons rambling nonchalantly all over the whole
structure. Added to this grandeur was a new gold watch on a long
chain which went twice around her neck and eventually came to
rest in a pocket sewed on her bosom, the pocket constructed of
lace so that the gold of the watch would shine through. Henry
Lutz was very proud of his purchase. "There's a whole horse
around Emma's neck," he would announce with complacence. It
sounded rather startling at first hearing, until one realized he
meant no acrobatic feat, but that the price of a horse had gone
into the chain.</p>
<p>Will went over to town after Emma and her trunk first, and
then the two came back to the farm for Margaret, who had been
ready for an hour.</p>
<p>"You're sure you'll get along, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course I'll get along." Abbie was outwardly calm and
confident, while all the time there was that queer sensation of a
wind rushing by,--a wind she could not stop,--Time going by which
she could not stay. Oh, stop the clock hands! Stop Time for a
minute until she could think whether it was right for Margaret to
go away and leave her.</p>
<p>"Good-by, dear!" Oh, stop the clock hands!</p>
<p>Will was calling. "Trunk's in. All ready in there?" Stop Time
for a while,--until she could think--!</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother, do you think I <i>ought</i> to go?"</p>
<p>"Of <i>course</i> you ought to go." Head up, Abbie was
smiling.</p>
<p>"Good-by, then . . . !"</p>
<p>They were down the lane road now, past the Lombardy poplars.
Now they had turned east onto the main road. Margaret was
dividing her handkerchief between her eyes and waving. Abbie
waved and smiled,--waved and smiled,--as long as they were in
sight. Then she turned and ran blindly into her bedroom and shut
the door. And, whether she has driven away in a lumber-wagon or a
limousine, the mother whose daughter has left her for the first
time, will understand why Abbie Deal ran blindly into her bedroom
and shut the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c19" id="c19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>That fall, Dr. Hornby, Henry Lutz and Will Deal went up to
Omaha to interview the powers that were, in regard to the
railroad coming through Cedartown instead of farther to the north
as the plans seemed to be. Later the Superintendent came down and
was driven through the farming section by Henry Lutz. In
consequence, Cedartown drew the branch line, and with many an
expression of high glee, figuratively made faces at the Weeping
Water delegation which had worked against the southern route.</p>
<p>Margaret's school year was a wonderful experience. There were
thirty tuition pupils, about half from the town of Weeping Water
and half from farm homes. The minister, in whose family Margaret
stayed, had a nephew who was studying to be a doctor, and who had
come to visit his uncle. "His name is Fred Baker and I wish you
could know him, Mother," Margaret reported. "You never in your
<i>life</i> saw such a fine young man."</p>
<p>Abbie wondered.</p>
<p>In July of '86, the railroad was finished through to Lincoln.
And now, Cedartown would no longer sit out on the prairie by
herself. No longer would twenty-three miles of snow drifts or
deep ruts of mud lie between her and the capital city. Cedartown
residents held their heads a little higher, spoke largely of
"train-time" and "making connections for Omaha." Already the
stones were in place for the foundation of the station. A train
each way every day, mail in a sack being thrown carelessly out of
a baggage-car instead of from a pony's back, a telegraph machine
clicking noisily in a three-roomed station. What more
metropolitan atmosphere could one desire?</p>
<p>The day that the first train came through was a gala one. Word
had been wafted about by some occult means that any one who
wanted to do so could ride to the end of the line free of charge.
The entire Cedartown population, including two puppies and a cat,
was on hand to pile hilariously into the box-cars and ride to the
end of the road. Old Asy Drumm took his hammer and his saw and
his tobacco, and drove over to the track with the Deals, as he
had just finished building another room to the rear of the house.
Upon their return from the free railroad trip, Abbie and Margaret
began painting the pine woodwork in the new kitchen. Margaret,
since her year in the academy, was a little fussy about the way
things looked.</p>
<p>Abbie's plans for going back home that summer had gone into
nothing on account of the new kitchen and the fact that she
realized more and more that, because Isabelle was the musical one
of the family, she must have an organ.</p>
<p>The Lutzes were getting Emma a fine new piano, so Will bought
their second-hand reed-organ. On Isabelle's ninth birthday he
brought it home in the lumber-wagon. Isabelle was beside herself
with excitement. Her little legs pumped furiously up and down to
get air into the creature's cloth lungs and her little, slender,
tapering fingers ran nimbly over the keys.</p>
<p>Abbie, herself, sat down and tried to pick out a few chords of
an old song, but her fingers were stiff and clumsy.</p>
<p>"By George, you're the one that ought to take lessons," Will
said suddenly, "the way you always wanted . . ."</p>
<p>"No . . ." Abbie got up from the whirling carpet-covered
stool. "No." Her lips trembled a little so that she did not look
up. "At forty it's too late."</p>
<p>In the spring of '87 the community was presented with the
first issue of the Cedartown <i>Headlight,</i> a small sheet with
growing pains. It contained a great many items pertaining to "the
growth of our fair city." It said that Mr. William Deal arrived
in front of the editorial office in a fine new green lumber-wagon
with red wheels, that on April fools' day a cow of Mr. Oscar
Lutz's presented him with twin calves, that a box social was held
in the G. A. R. hall, at which a good time was had by all. One
gathered from an editorial that subscriptions could be paid with
cobs, butchered beef and money, but that the greatest of these
was money.</p>
<p>Crops continued to be good. Abbie thought that this coming
summer of '87 would prove to be the one in which she could go
back home. And then, before she was ready, she knew she was to be
a mother. With Isabelle, her youngest child, nearly ten, Abbie
thought she could not face motherhood again,--not at
forty-one.</p>
<p>"That means I won't go back to the academy, Mother," Margaret
told her. But Abbie said she would manage, that she <i>had</i> to
manage somehow, for Margaret must finish.</p>
<p>In the fall, with Will protesting a little, Margaret and John
both went to Weeping Water to school. And in November, Maggie
O'Conner Mackenzie died, without having seen Abbie in twenty
years. Bitterness came over Abbie with her grief. Why should life
on the prairie have demanded so much of her? Why should twenty
years have been so hard, so barren? By her condition, both her
grief and her bitterness were accentuated.</p>
<p>At Christmas time, which was cold with deep snow, Margaret and
John came home,--Margaret with her gray eyes luminous, her cheeks
flushed with prairie-rose tints. She could not wait to tell her
mother shyly that the young Fred Baker, who was a nephew of the
minister, had been there again. He had only two more years in
medical school and then he would be <i>Doctor</i> Fred Baker. He
wanted her to write to him. And she liked him,--oh, <i>how</i>
she liked him.</p>
<p>And Abbie wondered.</p>
<p>John, serious, quiet, "liked his work all right." Of all the
children, John was the hardest to understand. One almost had to
read his mind to get anything out of him. Mack, too, was home for
the day. He had graduated from the broom-and-dust-cloth and was
on the books all the time. His round face, from which the
freckles had miraculously disappeared, had taken on a more alert
look, his round china-blue eyes a keener expression.</p>
<p>Isabelle played and sang for them, "Way Down Upon the Swanee
River," and "Bonny Charlie's Now Awa'," her childish voice
soaring forth lustily, her slim little legs pumping
vigorously.</p>
<p>Abbie was thankful the children were all doing so well.</p>
<p>Christmas over, Mack left for Omaha, and after New Year,
Margaret and John went back to the academy. Elsa Reinmueller came
over three mornings in the week to help.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the twelfth of January, Abbie put her
shawl over her shoulders and walked down the road to
Reinmuellers'. The day was like a spring one,--a soft, mild,
spring day.</p>
<p>"It's probably the last time I can go to any of the
neighbor's," she had said to Will, "and it will do Christine good
to think I made the effort to come over once more to see
her."</p>
<p>The sun was warm. There was moisture on the sides of the
cedars and cottonwoods. Hens scratched in the damp, steaming
ground on the south side of the straw stacks, their liege lords
crowing ecstatically over their activities.</p>
<p>Abbie walked cumbersomely, heavy with child. It was hard for
her at forty-one to get about. The old buffalo trail of twenty
years before, with its faintly outlined tracks, was a
well-defined road now, running on to the big town of Lincoln, as
straight as the crow, except for one short deviation, where it
formed a letter S over the new Missouri Pacific railroad.</p>
<p>As she neared the Reinmueller house, Gus drove out of the yard
with two of the younger boys on their way to town.</p>
<p>Abbie drew her shawl closer around her and called pleasantly,
"Spring is here."</p>
<p>"Ya," shouted Gus. "She's come, all right. Weather-breeder,
that's what she is. Ya . . . look at that." Pigeons had settled
down before his horses' hoofs, to rise with a whirr of wings and
settle again. What did Gus mean? Was it a bad sign? Grandma Deal
would have said it was.</p>
<p>How queer that Gus used so much better English than Christine,
Abbie was thinking. It seemed that Christine didn't even try to
talk right.</p>
<p>She found Christine alone in the square, box-like house which
had replaced the dug-out. The girls had gone over to Lutz's
store, Christine said. Rosie was going to work at Dr.
Hornby's.</p>
<p>The two women talked for some time about trivial neighborhood
things, beyond which they had little in common.</p>
<p>Neighborliness, caused by the proximity of their houses and
the fact that they had come into the new country at the same
time, held them together. Christine was paradoxically rough and
kind, penurious and unselfish. After a time, Abbie rose
laboriously and said she must go. At the door she and Christine
stood for a few minutes in parting. The northern sky was the
color of dark gray ashes. It was very quiet,--the hushed quiet of
a waiting storm god who gloats a little over the peace of Nature
before he assaults. Suddenly Abbie felt half frightened and did
not know why.</p>
<p>The great gray clouds were now coming in from the northwest,
rolling low over the land like billows of thick smoke from a
thousand factories of the storm gods located somewhere beyond on
the prairie. A single snarling blast came out of the clouds and
needles of snow struck Abbie in the face.</p>
<p>Even while she hurried out of the yard, the wind was whipping
her shawl about her and a great smother of snow was engulfing
her.</p>
<p>"Come back, you," Christine was at Abbie's side.</p>
<p>"No, Christine, I must get home." She had to say it close to
Christine's ear in the roaring of the storm.</p>
<p>Christine ran her arm through Abbie's, "With you I go." Abbie
made a single feeble protest and then clung to Christine.</p>
<p>In the welter of snow they reached the far side of the road
opposite the Reinmuellers', and Christine with her left arm
hooked through Abbie's, ran her right hand along the top of the
wire fence for guidance. The wind lashed them until they cowered
from it. The snow, in great swirling masses, drove its stinging
clods into their eyes and nostrils. Irregular drifts formed at
their feet in a moment's time. When there came one terrific blast
of wind more infuriated than others, Christine clung harder to
the wire, the ugly barbs digging the flesh until the blood came.
And then the composition of the snow seemed to change. It was no
longer even slightly pliable, but a cruel, hard, dry substance
which cut at them like bullets and nails and knives.</p>
<p>Abbie's strength in her present physical condition was going.
She stopped and moaned at the necessity of pushing her cumbersome
self into the jaws of the storm. Christine, with her more wiry
robustness, half dragged the lagging body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the barbed-wire gave place to picket and Christine
knew that the Deals' yard-fence was reached.</p>
<p>"Now, not so far," she shouted into Abbie's ear. They
wallowed, slackened, stopped altogether, crouched before the
fury, and then gathered themselves together and plunged on again.
Abbie, with her waning strength, had ceased to think, except to
obey Christine.</p>
<p>And then the pickets ended abruptly in a post, with space
beyond, and Christine realized that it was the open lane-gate and
that she had unknowingly passed the small front gate.</p>
<p>"Vait," she shouted. But she had no reason to encourage Abbie
in waiting. For Abbie had sunk into the icy bed of a huge drift
with the pangs of childbirth upon her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c20" id="c20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And now Christine had to pull Abbie out of the drift and put
forth all her effort to get the suffering woman to retrace her
steps to the little front gate. She did not dare turn into the
wide open gateway and run the risk of losing her bearings in the
uncharted wilderness of the lane road.</p>
<p>In the added fear of her childbirth warnings, Abbie clung to
Christine with all her strength. "Oh, . . . Christine . . . I
can't go any farther . . ." The storm god took the words and
threw them back into her face.</p>
<p>"Come . . . you!" Christine hurled savagely into Abbie's ear.
"Of your man t'ink. Of your <i>kinder</i> t'ink. You're
<i>verrückt</i> . . . crazy!"</p>
<p>Christine kept her freezing right arm through Abbie's, and
plunging slowly ahead, grasped every picket with her left.
Pausing, cowering, plunging, pulling Abbie's half-prostrate body,
she came to the welcome cross-pieces of the small gate. "By de
cedars ve tell," she called in Abbie's ear. They turned blindly,
for all directions seemed lost in the mad whirl of snow, crawled
through the gateway, and grasped the first cedar. "How many?"
Christine was calling.</p>
<p>"Nine," Abbie moaned. She held onto the last far-reaching
branch of the first cedar while Christine felt for the
second.</p>
<p><i>"Zwei!"</i></p>
<p>Pushing on, cowering before the white smother, they crawled.
The storm tore Abbie's shawl from her and the frozen icicles of
her wet hair beat her face like tiny razor blades.</p>
<p><i>"Drei."</i></p>
<p>As she felt Christine pulling her forward, the hideous
agonizing childbirth pains shook her freezing body again and she
sank in a wildly whirling drift.</p>
<p><i>"Du narr!"</i> Christine snarled at her ear. "Come <i>. . .
du narr</i> . . . fool!"</p>
<p>She set her teeth and plunged ahead while the icy needles drew
something moist and trickling from her face.</p>
<p><i>"Vier."</i></p>
<p>And now her breath was going. One could not struggle on when
there was no air to breathe. Christine was pulling her. Because
she had no breath, Christine was pulling her.</p>
<p><i>"Fünf."</i></p>
<p>Abbie sank to her knees in pain. Christine jerked at her
fiercely. "Get you up." In her ear Christine was yelling. "You
die . . . you like dat dyin' maybe . . . nein? Your baby . . .
you keel heem . . . you like dat keelin' your baby maybe?" No,
she must not kill her baby, so she must do as Christine said. But
it was so painful--</p>
<p><i>"Sechs."</i></p>
<p>Abbie began to be too numb to feel the cold. What was the use
of obeying Christine? Christine had no right to boss so.</p>
<p><i>"Sieben."</i></p>
<p>The white suffocating smother was turning dark. There seemed
no use fighting the hideous black thing that was closing her
breath.</p>
<p><i>"Acht!"</i></p>
<p>Christine was pushing and dragging her. She ought to help
Christine push and drag . . .</p>
<p><i>"Neun!"</i></p>
<p>Together they plunged to the wall of the house. By the loyal
cedars they had found their way. In a war of snow, when the whole
world was fighting it in mortal combat, only the cedars seemed
not to have lost their heads. Only Abbie's cedars and Christine
seemed faithful to her. Abbie knew that Christine was dragging
her now into the warm shelter of the house. She heard Christine
say something about: "Heis vater, qvick!" and then she tumbled
into a sea of suffering to which there seemed no shore and in
which time was not measured. It was hard to breathe. Sometimes
she saw faces dimly which came and went. Sometimes she vaguely
heard whisperings. Sometimes she smelled steamy woolens and moist
hot flannels. Most of the time she was sinking under cold
smothering water. Only one thing brought her back,--a light,--a
lantern shining down into the icy waters. It shone to light the
way back up for her. Each time she sank, she kept her eyes on the
light and said, "Will . . . Mack . . . Margaret . . . John . . .
Isabelle . . ." And the saying of the names bore her back to the
surface and the light.</p>
<p>And then, in some queer intuitive way, she knew her life was
going out with the tide. The light grew fainter and farther
away.</p>
<p>She did not care especially, except for one thing. The light!
She ought not lose sight of its faint gleam. Some tiny spark of
memory kept reminding her that she must never take her eyes away
from the far-off glow of the lantern. So that, sinking, she kept
pulling herself feebly back toward its faint gleam with "Will . .
. Mack . . . Margaret . . . John . . . Isabelle." She told the
words over as a nun touches her beads.</p>
<p>Her mind was not lucid enough to understand that through
constant utterance, she was trying to pray that she might come
back to her responsibility,--that she had so much to do yet for
the family,--that they could not get along without her. Over and
over, she said them, "Will . . . Mack . . . Margaret . . . John .
. . Isabelle." Each name a bead--each bead a prayer. And when her
mind cleared a little, and she heard a strange new wail, she
remembered a new responsibility and said them over again, "Will .
. . Mack . . . Margaret . . . John . . . Isabelle . . . <i>the
baby.</i>" Each name a bead,--each bead a prayer. Fighting the
icy waters feebly, with only the thought of the light to keep
them from closing over her, she came back at times to the
consciousness of the homely red face of Christine by her bed,
nodding, jerking up, nodding--</p>
<p>And when the light grew clearer and more steady and the cold
water seemed gone, Will told her that the baby was a girl.</p>
<p>"We'll name her Grace," Abbie said feebly, "Grace of God.
She'll be a comfort. She'll stay with us longer . . . maybe . . .
than a boy. Where's Christine, Will?"</p>
<p>Christine Reinmueller came in to stand by the bed, her short
shapeless body in a blue calico dress, her greasy little tight
braids of hair wound flat from ear to ear, her fat red face
scarred with scratches.</p>
<p>Abbie reached up and pulled her down. Arms close around her,
she kissed her rough cheek. "Christine . . . my friend . . . my
friend for all my life."</p>
<p>Christine writhed in embarrassment, <i>"Ach! Du sans
garrich</i> . . . voolish." She pulled away. <i>"Es ist nix . .
.</i> nossing."</p>
<p>It seemed odd to Abbie to have a baby again after ten years.
Sometimes she said she was afraid she had forgotten how to care
for one. But when she grew strong, it all came back to her. The
Abbie Deals do not forget.</p>
<p>Margaret graduated from the academy in the spring of that
year. Fred Baker, the minister's nephew, who was to be a
full-fledged doctor in one more year, arrived in time for the
graduating exercises, and brought her a stereoscope with views of
"Niagara Falls," "Hudson Bay by Moonlight," "The Wedding Party,"
and several others with subtle suggestions of a romantic nature.
Margaret rode home in the lumber-wagon with the stereoscopic
views in her lap and her head somewhere beyond the prairie
clouds.</p>
<p>John went back to the academy in the fall, but Margaret was at
home with Abbie for the year. And that year was to seem very
short to Abbie, for Margaret was getting ready to marry the
embryonic doctor. And as all the estate, real or personal, which
the two owned, consisted of the stereoscope and the twelve
picturesquely romantic views, the year was crowded with the
making of quilts, the hemming of sheets, and the sewing of
carpet-rags.</p>
<p>The next spring, Abbie's dream of a parlor came into the world
of reality. They built it on the south side of the old part,
protruding toward the road. They wanted it done before Margaret's
wedding, and the wedding was already set for June. Old Asy Drumm,
a little more stooped and silent and tobacco-stained, finished
the last door-latch and the last piece of mop-board several weeks
before the momentous occasion. John and Will painted the pine
exterior and Abbie and Margaret varnished the pine interior.
There were two modish details about that parlor of which Abbie
was inordinately proud,--the fan-shaped colored-glass window
toward the road and the double doors that slipped mysteriously
into the wall when pushed backward. To be sure, in looking
through the fan-shaped glass one saw a bilious green sky, sickly
yellow cedars, a wavering blue picket fence and a nightmarish red
lawn, but this was a mere bagatelle beside the touch of
distinction it gave. Also the doors, after mysteriously
disappearing into the walls, could not always be coaxed readily
out of their hiding places, so that the women folk would have to
call "John . . ." or "Father . . . come help us, will you?" Abbie
was proud of them, though, and all her life made loyal excuses
for "the doors sticking just a little to-day."</p>
<p>Abbie and Margaret rode up to Lincoln on the branch line, with
its small engine, its one coach and baggage car, and bought a red
and green sale carpet for the new parlor, Nottingham curtains, an
oak patent-swinging rocker, and a marble-topped stand with a blue
plush album. It seemed too much grandeur at one time for a single
family to acquire. Abbie's rather critical conscience reminded
her constantly that Rome was at the height of its glory just
before the fall. She sewed the strips of carpet together and then
the united family put it down over a layer of newspapers and
fresh oat straw. Will, Abbie and John crawled along one side of
the room on their hands and knees, pulling and stretching and
tacking, while Margaret kept the straw pushed down as level as
she could, so the result would not be Rocky-Mountain-like, and
Isabelle kept little Grace, a year and a half old now, from
putting the tacks into her mouth. When these two stupendous tasks
were accomplished, and the carpet was taut and springy over its
oat field, they put up the curtains, moved in the organ and the
what-not, Abbie's old painting of the prairie, the new chair and
the stand, the blue plush album and the stereopticon views,
which, luckily, were to remain in the parlor through the wedding.
Surveying the finished product, Abbie wondered if any of the
Astors or Vanderbilts about whom she had read, ever had anything
quite so stylish.</p>
<p>And then Margaret's dress was to be made and all the wedding
to be planned. Margaret said she had her heart set on a navy blue
silk with white ruching and--</p>
<p>Her mother stopped her. "Don't you . . ." Abbie was wistful.
"Don't you wish we could afford a white satin dress and white
slippers and a veil?"</p>
<p>"No, Mother . . . the navy blue silk is just what I want. As
long as Fred and I are going right to the rooms over the drug
store, I want my clothes to be suitable and I might never have
use for a white satin again. Besides, now that I'm going to live
in Lincoln, I want to save every penny toward painting supplies.
I'm never happier than when I'm opening up the paint-box and
getting at the oil and brushes. You know, Mother, my housework
won't be much . . . just think . . . those few tiny rooms to keep
and not any of the work there is here on the farm . . . and I'm
going into my painting for all it's worth. I can't explain it to
you, Mother, but there's something in me . . . that if I could
just get down on canvas the way the cottonwoods look against the
sky, or the way the prairie looks at sunset with the pink light .
. ." she broke off. "Oh, I suppose you think I'm daffy . . . you
wouldn't understand."</p>
<p>Abbie, at the east kitchen window, looked over the low rolling
hills where the last of the May sunshine lay in yellow-pink pools
on the prairie. Her lips trembled a little. "Yes, I would," she
said simply. "I'd understand."</p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, it was the night of the wedding. The
moon slipped up from a fleecy cloud-bed and with silvery
congratulations swung low over the farmhouse behind the cedars.
The whole countryside was there. In a community where there have
been few lines drawn, one does not begin to draw them at wedding
times. The lane road held all manner of vehicles,--lumber-wagons,
buggies, phaetons, carts, surreys, hayracks. The Lutzes were all
there and all of the Reinmuellers but Emil, who sat on a milk
stool in the barn at home all evening and sulked. Sarah Lutz
looked stylish in her tight-fitting black dress of stiff silk,
with jet earrings against her rosy cheeks. Christine had a new
blue calico gathered on full at the waistline.</p>
<p>Mack surprised them all by driving up the lane road in a
shining black buggy with canary yellow wheels, yellow lines over
the horse's black back, and a yellow whip. He drove over to the
Lutz's and came back with Emma Lutz, who was trying her best not
to look important.</p>
<p>The presents were all in the sitting-room, the small things on
tables. There were two red plush chairs, a stylish castor, a
green glass pitcher with frosted glasses, three lamps with snow
scenes on the globes, several hand-made splashers and tidies, and
enough cold meat and pickle forks to supply a garrison of
soldiers with fighting equipment. Gus and Christine, out of
deference to the literary tastes of the family, had bought a huge
volume, their decision over the purchase having been based upon
weight rather than content, and which now, upon inspection,
proved to be <i>Twenty Lessons in Etiquette.</i></p>
<p>Some time before the ceremony Abbie climbed the uncarpeted
pine stairs with the little calf-skin-covered chest under her
arm. Just as her mother had climbed the sapling ladder in the old
log cabin, she was thinking. Wasn't life queer? Such a little
while ago, it seemed. Where had the time gone? Blown away by the
winds you could not stop,--ticked off by the clock hands you
could not stay.</p>
<p>Margaret was nearly dressed. Her blue silk, with its fifteen
yards of goods, was looped back modishly over a bustle, the train
dragging behind her with stylish abandon. Abbie sat down on the
edge of her daughter's bed, the chest in her lap. "You know,
Margaret, it was always a kind-of dream of mine that by the time
you were married, we'd be well enough off to do a lot of things
for you. I always saw you in my mind dressed in white with a veil
and slippers,--not just that I wanted you dressed that one
way,--but I mean as a sort of symbol,--that we'd be able to do
all the things for you that should rightfully go with the pearls.
But," Abbie's voice broke a little and she stopped to steady it,
"things don't always turn out just as we dream,--and we're not
able to do much for you. But anyway, you shall wear the pearls
to-night if you want to."</p>
<p>Margaret, holding up her long dress, crossed the rag-carpeted
floor in little swift happy steps, and threw young arms around
her mother.</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> know all you've done for me, Mother." She took
Abbie's rough hands in her own firm ones and held them to her
lips. "And it's <i>everything,</i>--just <i>everything</i> that
you could do. Never as long as I live can I ever repay it." There
were tears in the young girl's eyes and to keep them back, she
said lightly, "No, thanks, Mother, dear. I'm all right with my
lovely blue silk and the white silk ruching at my neck. Keep them
for Isabelle or baby Grace. You and father will be well-fixed in
a few years. The land will be higher. You're having good crops
now and by the time Isabelle is married, your dream can come
true. And besides, Mother, dear," she put her young cheek against
Abbie's, "<i>you know</i> that when you marry the man you love,
you don't need jewels to make you happy."</p>
<p>Yes, yes,--how the words came back, borne on the breeze of
memories! How swiftly the clock hands had gone around! Abbie
could not speak. She must shed no tears on her little girl's
wedding day. So, she only patted her and kissed her, smiling at
her through a thousand unshed tears. And you, who have seen your
mother smile when you left her,--or have smiled at your
daughter's leaving,--know it is the most courageous smile of
all.</p>
<p>And then it was time to go downstairs. Margaret and young
Doctor Fred Baker came down the enclosed pine stairway and across
the parlor, Margaret's silk dress dragging stylishly over the red
and green spirals of the sale carpet. Isabelle pedaled and played
the wedding march, lustily, the sound of the wind pumping into
the reeds rather prominent above the melody.</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell on the friends gathered from all the farms
and the little village. Abbie stood by Will, who was holding
Grace in his arms. John was at her other side. Mack sauntered
over and stood by Emma Lutz. Isabelle stopped playing and the
voice of the preacher came hurtling against the silence:</p>
<p>"Inasmuch as we are gathered together--"</p>
<p>Abbie thought she could not stand it. She must call out in one
great scream that she could not let her little girl go away from
her.</p>
<p>"For better or for worse." <i>Oh, God, don't let Margaret have
to go through all the hardships I did.</i></p>
<p>"Until death do you part." There, they were speaking of death
again. Why did they always talk about death when there was only
life before them?</p>
<p>"Do you take this man. . . ."</p>
<p>And now Abbie was going to break down and cry. She threw up
her head. No, not a tear, not a single tear! If she started, she
would turn into a Niobe to weep herself to death.</p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, Margaret Deal was Mrs. Fred
Baker.</p>
<p>After that, with Isabelle pumping away faithfully, if windily,
on the "Blue Danube Waltz," and "By the Blue Alsatian Mountains,"
some of the young folks danced on the new sale carpet, with the
straw underneath working itself up into little hummocks.</p>
<p>There were biscuits and pressed chickens, cakes and lemonade
out on the side porch. Christine Reinmueller and Sarah Lutz took
turns in shaking the fly-brush with its long paper streamers over
the tables, so that no unusual number of flies would light on the
food. Every one had a grand and glorious time. There was only one
queer thing about the whole affair,--a new dish among the
refreshments which no one in the community had served before. Men
folks going home, asked their wives why in Sam Hill the potatoes
were all cold, and their wives said to hush and not show their
ignorance, that it was something new called "potato salad" and it
was <i>supposed</i> to be cold. At which, most of the men laughed
long and raucously and said by golly, for their part, they'd take
theirs hot-fried or baked in the skins.</p>
<p>And back on the porch of the farmhouse behind the cedars,
Abbie Deal stood and watched her married daughter drive away
under the starlit summer sky. Then she turned and went into the
kitchen and wound the old Seth Thomas clock with the little brown
church painted on the glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c21" id="c21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>After Margaret's marriage, life seemed to move along in a
monotonous regularity that summer. Letters came from her twice a
week and they were full of enthusiasm and plans. It was nice to
have her so happily married, Abbie thought. Mack did not write so
often. When he did, the letter was brief and businesslike. He had
received a raise in wages. The president, himself, commended him
about something. Omaha was growing. You would be surprised to see
how large it was getting. One gathered the impression from Mack
that he was joint-owner in all the enterprises. Well, it was a
good trait, Abbie thought. Loyalty! It was nice for a boy to feel
so much a part of a town.</p>
<p>John was helping his father with the farm work,--a silent boy.
Abbie, looking at him curiously at times, wondered if she would
ever understand him. Isabelle, at twelve, was practicing several
hours a day, with no coaxing, "General Grant's Grand March" and
"Dance of the Flowers."</p>
<p>Sometimes, in her interest over it, she would forget time
altogether, and Abbie would scold, "Come, Isabelle, too much of
that at once isn't good for you." Little Grace at eighteen months
was toddling everywhere and into everything. It seemed to Abbie
that she pulled her out of one thing, only to turn and see her
getting into something else. She loved her deeply. "Whatever
would we have done without her?" she would say to Will.</p>
<p>There had been days of ordinary happenings in the summer of
'89 until the heat of August hung over the land like a
blanket.</p>
<p>Abbie had learned to know the prairie in all its moods,--and
the mood of August was a lazy, somnolent one. There was a
noticeable decrease in the songs of birds, for molting time had
begun, although one could hear the cardinal's "what cheer" and
the pee-wee calling his own name with plaintive patience all
through the day and even after sunset and twilight. Elderberry
bushes massed along Stove Creek, had exchanged their lacy
headgear for black bonnets of ripe fruit. Along the grassy
roadway, one's skirts touched Queen Anne's lace, field mustard
and yarrow. Wild morning-glories tangled through the grass, and
metallic beetles of iridescent red and green climbed the sticky
stems of milkweeds. The yellow of sunflowers, the white of
boneset and the azure blue of chicory stood in friendly groups on
all sides, and everywhere there were plumes of goldenrod, like
plumes from the hats of lovely ladies. Spiders, the highwaymen of
all the insects, spread their webs in the pastures to hold up
their victims. A covey of baby quail, nearly full-grown, could be
flushed almost any time a horse and rider crossed a field, and
down by the creek bed the mink and muskrat families had begun
breaking home ties, with the brown sons and daughters hunting for
themselves.</p>
<p>On one of these August afternoons, with the sun hot, and the
hollyhocks blood-red against Abbie's white pickets, with the
sound of crooning hens outside the windows and a settled air of
languor over the whole farm, Abbie heard a sound of snorting
horses, and looked out of the east kitchen window to see John's
team charging down the field, the knives of the mower close upon
their heels, and John not in sight.</p>
<p>With a horrible sensation of fright, so nightmarish that she
seemed not able to pull her wooden limbs along, she ran out. John
was lying against the barbed wire of the fence, white as the
pickets of the garden gate, a sickening stream of scarlet
trickling from his foot. Ill at the sight, Abbie ran to a small
new plum tree and broke off its top. She pulled up the lower
barbed wire of the fence and crawled through, snatching off her
apron, and binding it above the ankle, with the plum stick
knotted in between. John's eyes opened, and clung in fright to
his mother.</p>
<p>"Mother, do something for me," he moaned in the old,
little-boy way.</p>
<p>Abbie heard some one, who seemed not herself, saying, in a
steady cool voice, "Yes, John, trust Mother."</p>
<p>The horses, frothing, now, at the bits and flanks, were
standing against the fence at the far side of the field, trying
to reach green corn-ears over the wire. Across the hay-stubble
Abbie ran to them. On the way she kept saying, "Oh, God . . . one
more thing . . . help me through this <i>one</i> more thing."
With frantic movements, she unhitched and led the team back into
the yard and hitched them to the lumber-wagon. She seemed to have
acquired Amazonian strength. Isabelle, who had run out, was
crying in silent fright. "Bring pillows from the beds," Abbie
called. Back into the field she drove in the wagon. Fearful to
leave the horses, which had not yet settled down to their usual
docility, she tied them to the fence post.</p>
<p>"Mother . . . do something."</p>
<p>"Yes, John,--trust Mother."</p>
<p>Together, Abbie and Isabelle, pulling and lifting, got the
suffering boy into the wagon with his head on a pillow. Already
the apron was scarlet. Abbie jerked off the wagon-seat, piling
the other pillows on it, and propped up the mangled foot. She
jumped out, untied the team, and climbed back over the wheel into
the wagon-box.</p>
<p>"Look after the baby," she called to Isabelle, and started the
horses out of the field on a gallop. Against the dashboard she
stood and clung to the lines which almost cut her as they sawed
through her hands. The wagon bounced and careened and rocked. The
pins came from Abbie's hair, and the red-brown mass, faded now,
and with a few graying streaks, fell over her shoulders.</p>
<p>In Cedartown, people ran out of their houses and looked after
her. As she reached Dr. Hornby's, she had to use all her strength
to get the team stopped. Men, running out from the little stores,
came to help, catching the horses by the bits and tying them to
one of the long row of hitching posts. Dr. Hornby and Henry Lutz
and Asy Drumm carried the boy into the one-story office.</p>
<p>"Stay by me, Mother."</p>
<p>"Yes, John, I won't leave you."</p>
<p>Abbie held the boy's hand, her thick hair still tumbled over
her shoulders while Dr. Hornby cut and cleansed and tied. When
the last neat bandage was fastened, Abbie Deal slipped to the
floor in a crumpled heap.</p>
<p>John's life was saved only by a few moments,--only by the time
gained through Abbie's wild drive into town. For weeks, his foot
propped in its one position, he suffered all the agonies of a cut
and tortured tendon of Achilles. And always he was to carry a
horny scar.</p>
<p>It was the nearest that death had come to the family since
Abbie's long illness. Will and Abbie, sitting on the side porch,
on a warm August evening, talked of it in low tones.</p>
<p>"Death . . . Will," Abbie said. "How the fear of it always
hangs over me. If John had died . . ."</p>
<p>"Death," Will repeated it. "Death . . ." He looked beyond the
Lombardy poplars, stared for a moment up into the deepening
prairie twilight. "I wonder why we fear it?" He spoke as though
to himself. "The naturalness of it! Wild geese flying over . . .
cattle coming home . . . birds to their nests . . . leaves to the
winter mold . . . the last sleep. How natural they all are, and
yet of them all, we fear only the sleep. When my time comes I
wish my family and friends could think of it that way . . .
without tears."</p>
<p>"Oh, Will, don't talk so. If you should be taken away from me,
I couldn't stand it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you could, Abbie-girl. You could stand it. It's the
people who have loved and then lost their love . . . who have
failed each other in some way, who couldn't stand it. With you
and me . . . all we've been through together and all we've meant
to each other . . . with us, it couldn't be so terrible. Nothing
could take away the past from us. You are so much a part of me,
that if you were taken away, I think it would seem that you just
went on with me. And I'm sure if I were the one taken I would go
on with you, remembering all you had been to me."</p>
<p>So seldom did Will speak that which was in his heart. And now
he had spoken. Abbie sat and looked out into the star-filled sky.
There were the summer night odors,--clover hay and ripening
apples and sweet alyssum. There were the summer night
sounds,--cicada and frogs and a crooning bird. There were the
summer night movements,--the trembling of the leaves on the
poplars, a night hawk dipping low, a bit of lacy cloud slipping
across the moon. For a moment, Abbie Deal seemed greater than
herself, larger than humanity. For a brief time, a sense of deep
wisdom was within her, a flood of infinite strength and peace
enveloped her.</p>
<p><i>I would go on with you . . . remembering . . .</i></p>
<p>All fall and early winter John, suffering, blue, discouraged,
was kept in with his bad foot. It had been a terrible cut, but it
was healing; and he was not going to be crippled, thanks to the
ministrations of a country doctor with few instruments and meager
equipment, but with a sound surgical knowledge. Young Dr.
Frederick Baker commended the older doctor's care of the case
with the cheerful condescension of the recent graduate.</p>
<p>By studying at home and taking his tests, John was able to
graduate with his class at the academy. Still favoring his foot a
little, he went into the field with his father.</p>
<p>That summer of '90 was the summer of the great drought. Day
after day, Will came into the kitchen with the pails of morning
milk to say, "Another scorcher. Not a cloud in the sky."</p>
<p>The hot belching winds blew in from the southwest. The grass
in the pastures knotted and scorched on its roots. The brittle
leaves of weeds rattled, like so many tiny castanets, whenever
the chickens walked through them. Blackberries hardened on the
bushes and fell to the ground. Raspberries were purple warts.
Peaches dried in the forming.</p>
<p>The small grain amounted to very little. The corn began to
curl and brown and bake on its roots. Crops were stillborn in the
womb of Nature.</p>
<p>Reports from other parts of the country were the same. The
state seemed to have slipped backward into its beginnings, to be
going through the same hard period experienced in the 'seventies.
Rumor came from the northern border that the Indians were dancing
the ghost dance. Abbie commenced to wish the family had not been
so extravagant,--buying the organ and the carpet, and building on
the room. That joke of hers about the fall of Rome was beginning
to seem ill-timed.</p>
<p>But the bad summer seemed not to bother the children. Grace
was two and a half now, "a smart little tike," every one said.
Margaret came home sometimes, but her young doctor husband was
too fearful of missing a case in the growing town of Lincoln to
leave often. Margaret was as happy as Abbie had ever wished her
to be. She was busy, too, with her painting, reveling in the time
and opportunity to work with it. She brought sketches out to show
Abbie and the two spent long moments talking them over.</p>
<p>Mack had good reports to make. Whenever he came for an
occasional Sunday in his friendly, breezy way, Abbie always felt
a renewal of pride in his virile young manhood, a feeling of
elation over his unceasing energy.</p>
<p>"People like Mack," she would say to Will, "but what's better,
they have confidence in him."</p>
<p>John was Will's standby in the farm work. Quiet, serious,
seldom speaking his mind, he seemed to Abbie more and more like
Will.</p>
<p>Isabelle was talking and thinking "music" all day. She was
taking lessons now from a woman in Cedartown. Abbie always drove
with her over to town on Saturday afternoons. While Isabelle took
her lesson, Abbie traded out the butter and eggs she had brought
to the Lutz store.</p>
<p>On one late Saturday afternoon in October, as Abbie was taking
Isabelle over to town for her music lesson, she met Dr. Fred and
Margaret riding out home with Oscar Lutz. They had come on the
late afternoon train to surprise the home folks.</p>
<p>A warm feeling of happiness was with Abbie when she drove the
old white mare back toward the lane road by the Lombardy poplars.
Mack was coming the next day, too. Never did life seem so
complete as when the children were all at home. Home was the hub
of the wheel. Always she and Will would live there, and always,
no matter where the children's activities led them, they would
come home to father and mother in the white farmhouse behind the
cedars. She was thinking this in a general way, and that she
would have chicken and hot biscuits for Sunday dinner, when she
turned into the lane road by the poplars.</p>
<p>Every one was out by the windmill,--John, Margaret, Dr. Fred
Baker, Grace, Oscar Lutz, Gus Reinmueller. They were standing in
a group,--a quiet, silent group,--only standing and doing
nothing. Something smote Abbie like a chilling hand, clutching at
her heart and throat. There was complete silence in the crowd,--a
whispering silence,--the same hushed silence of the time when the
baby was born dead. They all turned when she came up the lane
road,--turned toward her, but did not move,--looked at her,--and
were silent. Abbie got out of the buggy with wooden movements and
went over to the group. Dr. Fred Baker was kneeling on the grass.
By his side Will lay at the foot of the windmill, staring beyond
the Lombardy poplars.</p>
<p>Abbie knelt down by him, too. But he did not look at her. He
only lay and looked beyond the Lombardy poplars,--stared up into
the deepening prairie twilight.</p>
<p>Oscar Lutz's voice, hoarse and far away, said: "Is he . . .
?"</p>
<p>Dr. Fred's, low and far away, also, said: "Yes . . . gone." He
turned his head away and slipped a hand gently over Will's
eyelids.</p>
<p>Gus Reinmueller gave a sob. Oscar Lutz said, "There was a
<i>man</i> . . ." The children,--John, Margaret, Isabelle, little
Grace,--all began to cry wildly.</p>
<p>Abbie Deal dragged her eyes away from Will and looked across
the prairie as toward Golgotha. No one moved. There was no sound
but the children crying.</p>
<p>The cows were coming up to the pasture gate. The leaves of the
Lombardys floated onto the lane road. A bird flew into the
cedars. A long wedge-shaped line of wild geese flew low. Will lay
sleeping.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Abbie Deal seemed greater than herself, larger than
humanity. A sense of deep wisdom was within her, a flood of
infinite strength enveloped her. She rose and threw up her head.
"Hush!" she said quietly to the children. Almost sternly she said
it: "Hush! Not a child of Will Deal's is to shed a tear."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c22" id="c22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the prerogative of the dramatist to lower the curtain
upon a scene and raise it upon a later one,--of the story-teller
to close one chapter and begin another when time has passed. Real
life is not so. There is no kind interval of time as the settings
of the various experiences shift,--no heart-easing period of days
between the chapters of life.</p>
<p>Life is Time's galley-slave, forever shackled to its
relentless master. If its hardest blow be dealt at three o'clock,
then four o'clock must be met and five and six,--the first dark,
agonizing night and the first pale, torturing dawn.</p>
<p>And so it is unreal, even cowardly, to leave Abbie Deal
wrestling with her deepest emotions,--living two lives; one
within herself, wracked and tortured,--the other, an outward one
which met all the old duties and trivial obligations with
composure,--leave her in the garden of her Gethsemane, to meet
her many months later. Only the children had kept her going. Only
her motherhood, whose first characteristic was love and whose
second was duty, had kept her hands busy and her head unbowed.
These,--and one other thing which she could not explain: the
unseen presence of Will himself. She told no one,--made no
attempt to discuss the experience with any other. But much of the
time Will did not seem to be away. Whether the phenomenon were of
the spirit world with the metaphysical involved, a touch of the
supernatural which no man understands, or only a comforting
memory, she did not know. She accepted the solace in blind faith
and with soul-filled gratitude.</p>
<p>Through what agency came the consolation she could not say,
but she felt able to keep in touch with him. There was nothing of
the weird about it,--no foolish incantations to the dead. He just
seemed with her. It grew in time to give her a slight sense of
peace. It took from the separation the raw, tearing hurt. They
had been so close, so companionable, that she seemed always to
know what he would have said or done under any conditions. She
grew to imagine she was talking to him,--telling him the small
inconsequential affairs of the household, just as she had always
done. And he seemed to answer.</p>
<p>"We had the Lutzes out for supper, Will."</p>
<p><i>That was pleasant, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>She knew that she made her own answers, but paradoxically,
they seemed not to be. She had known Will's opinions so
thoroughly that, almost without her volition, the answers sprang
to her mind.</p>
<p>"The Reinmuellers were quarreling to-day, Will. You know,
Will, sometimes I think you and I are nearer even now than Gus
and Christine."</p>
<p><i>That's true, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>"I shall never tell any one," she said to herself. "I know
just how they would feel. They would look at me queerly and think
I was 'touched.' You do talk to me, Will, don't you?"</p>
<p><i>Why, of course, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p>And so, like an unseen presence, it came to give her a sense
of comfort, until the day on which there would come a reaction,
and she would plunge into a dark state of depression during which
she would turn upon herself with accusations of a childish belief
in her own fragile imagination. And then, in time,--something
would quiet her again. Something,--she did not know what,--the
wind in the Lombardy poplars,--the spirit of the deepening
prairie twilight,--the stillness of the star-filled summer
night,--or the memory of a voice saying, "I would go on with you
. . . remembering . . ."</p>
<p>The greatest antidote in the world for grief is work, and the
necessity of work. And Abbie had more to do than she had ever
done in her busy life.</p>
<p>John was the one upon whom she most depended. All the winter,
after his father's death, he had looked after the stock and all
spring he had worked faithfully putting in the new crop. Many
times one of the Reinmuellers had helped out, but John had
shouldered the greater share of the field work. His presence was
the only solution now to the problem of making a living on the
place. He was only eighteen, but in the years to come, if he
wanted to marry, Abbie told herself that he could have a small
house built near by,--or perhaps it would be better the other way
around,--she and Isabelle and Grace could live in the small
cottage and let John have the bigger house. John was so much like
his father, quiet, faithful, uncomplaining. He had none of Mack's
friendliness toward every one, but a reserve which was close to
dignity. Every night, all winter, after the chores were done, he
had cleaned up and with no explanation, mounted the enclosed
stairs to his own room. What did he do there, Abbie wondered, as
she built up the fire, so that the room above, heated by a "drum"
on the stovepipe, would be warm enough.</p>
<p>It was when she was cleaning the room in the spring that she
found the Blackstone tucked away between a homemade book-shelf
and the wall.</p>
<p>"John," Abbie said to him, "something is on your mind. What is
it? Won't you tell Mother?"</p>
<p>She had to work to get it out of him. And then, like one whose
resistance had snapped, he turned on her, "It's working on this
darned farm all my life. I hate it, I tell you." He had the fury
of a reserved person who stores up his grievances until one
exploding moment. It reminded Abbie of the few outbursts of Will
during their years together.</p>
<p>Abbie put her hand on the back of a chair to steady herself.
"What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>"Study law." And Will had said that the Deals were always for
the land. "I think of it all day and then dream it. And I'm going
to, some day."</p>
<p>That was like Will, too, Abbie thought,--to think a thing over
for a long time and then come to an irrevocable decision.</p>
<p>"But I know what you'll say to that." He spoke almost
sullenly.</p>
<p>It hurt Abbie so, to have him turn on her that way.</p>
<p>"I'm not unsympathetic, John. We'll have to plan some way it
can be done if you feel that way."</p>
<p>"Yes, and have you mad and disappointed about it." Why, oh
why, did children say things to hurt one?</p>
<p>"No, I'll not be mad," she controlled her trembling lips, "and
I'm not disappointed. I'm proud of your desire, John. For just a
few minutes I was . . . was confused."</p>
<p>"Then promise me you'll sell the place and take the two girls
and move into town."</p>
<p>"No, John," Abbie said with dignity. "I'll not sell. Land is
low, . . . and last year's crops so poor . . . No, it's my place
and I'm going to stay on it. We'll manage, somehow."</p>
<p>"Then that settles it. I'll stay too."</p>
<p>For long weeks Abbie labored with him. He was such a good boy,
so clean and energetic, and so stubborn. Then, when Abbie had
argued over and over again how she could manage by renting part
of the acreage to Oscar Lutz on shares, and hiring Pete
Reinmueller for the part of the work she could not do herself,
John went away to the University in the fall, with his one suit,
a few dollars in his pocket, and the promise of two jobs,--caring
for a professor's fires and a doctor's horses.</p>
<p>Isabelle entered Weeping Water Academy that fall, doing
part-time work in the minister's family for her board. And not
once did either she or John ever realize how many times their
mother put on an old coat and felt hat of their father's and went
out to some of the heavy work herself. Isabelle began immediately
to make splendid progress in music under a good teacher from the
East. "It's her voice, though, that's going to count," the
instructor said. "We must watch it and guard it."</p>
<p>In the summer, almost the first minute that John came home, he
put on his old clothes and went out to the field to work. But his
course was to be long and Isabelle's must contain all the music
she could get, so Abbie began figuring in what ways she could
help the two more. After several weeks of thinking it over and
consulting the boys, she took Oscar Lutz's offer for eighty acres
or half the farm. Oscar paid her one thousand dollars in cash and
gave his note for the other three thousand.</p>
<p>"It's not good business to sell for that," Abbie said. "I
think land's going to be higher some day, but it's now that the
children need a little help. I can get along. With the chickens
and eggs and butter and my pension money, I can keep things
going."</p>
<p>The crops were poor again, the drought of the year before
almost repeated. In spite of the general depression Henry and
Sarah Lutz went away on a trip back to the World's Fair at
Chicago. Henry had many irons in the fire, a blacksmith shop, his
store, the farms. He and Oscar seemed to get along. They always
"came out of the big end of the horn," people said. Sarah looked
dressy when she started away. She had a flaring black skirt and
white shirt-waist and a stiff black hat which she told Abbie was
a genuine Knox sailor.</p>
<p>"So's mine," said Abbie, good-naturedly. She took off her own
shabby old hat and twirled it on her hand. <i>"Hard
knocks."</i></p>
<p>When Sarah came back, she had some little garnet earrings and
a half-dozen spoons with the Fair buildings engraved on them and
pictures of the Infanta Eulalie from Spain and Mrs. Potter
Palmer.</p>
<p>In September, Abbie left Grace, nearly five now, with Sarah
and went up to Lincoln to be with Margaret. She drove the team
and took along the feed for it to save the two-dollar train fare
that would pay for four music lessons for Isabelle.</p>
<p>She got up at three and had started at four. Hours later, at
Stevens Creek bridge, she rested the team under some cottonwoods
and ate breakfast out of a shoe box. It showered during the last
three miles and the wheels threw mud and the buggy almost
mired.</p>
<p>The Bakers had moved into a house with a yard and a stable.
Dr. Baker's practice was picking up, although fees were hard to
collect. The hard times permeated into all businesses.</p>
<p>Abbie walked the floor in an agony of sympathy for Margaret.
"I went through this six times," she thought, "but this is harder
than any of them." Sometimes she slipped into the bedroom.
"Mother's here, Margaret," she said, cheerfully, "keep up your
courage."</p>
<p>And then the Bakers had a son,--Fred, Jr., they called
him.</p>
<p>At home again, Abbie found everything all right. Christine had
milked the two cows and had taken care of the pigs and chickens.
The farm activities, thanks to the Reinmuellers, had gone right
on. Only the clock had stopped.</p>
<p>Abbie wound the works behind the door with the little brown
church painted on the glass. She stood for a few minutes and
looked at the homely painted face of the old Seth Thomas
time-piece and listened to its sturdy faithful ticking. "A
grandmother!" she said to it. "I'm a grandmother. And it's not
quite believable."</p>
<p>
"You--can't--stop--time--you--can't--stop--time--you--can't--"</p>
<p>"Yes, you're right," Abbie admitted. "We won't argue it." She
put the key behind the little brown church painted on the glass
and shut the front.</p>
<p>"Well, Will," she said to that comrade who was only spirit and
memory, "you have a grandson."</p>
<p><i>I'm pretty proud of that, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>And then, the next spring, the whole community knew that Mack
was going to marry Emma Lutz,--Emma, with her mother's beady
black eyes and her rosy cheeks and a merry come-hither in her
eyes. And apparently the whole community was pleased, for
good-natured Emma Lutz was the village belle.</p>
<p>Mack was twenty-five, and having been promoted to a window in
the Omaha bank with the mystic word, "Teller" on it, he was by
way of being something of a capitalist in the eyes of his old
neighbors.</p>
<p>They were married at the Lutz house over in Cedartown on an
October evening of 1893. The Lutzes had a new house with a
squatty cupola on the southwest corner that looked like a
shingled bee-hive. The ceilings were high and there were wooden
rosettes over all the doors and windows and some new-fashioned
spindles on the stairway, through which little Grace fed
wedding-cake to the monkeys, actively impersonated by the Oscar
Lutz grandchildren. Mack and Emma left for Omaha at once, where
Mack had rented a little cottage on Dodge Street.</p>
<p>Abbie was forty-six now. The gray streaks in the red-brown
hair were prominent. There was a noticeable slumping of the lithe
shoulders, a thickening of hips. The peasant body of the
O'Conners was coming into its own. In all these years Abbie Deal
had not done anything with her voice, and she had not painted.
But as every good mother lives again in her children, her
personal disappointments were assuaged by Isabelle giving great
promise in her music, and Margaret improving in every canvas she
did. So Abbie felt that the children were doing the things she
had so deeply wanted to do. She realized that the time was long
past for her to build any more hopes on developing either of
those two talents for herself, but she still cherished a secret
ambition to write something.</p>
<p>"If I could just get down life as I have seen it," she would
think, ". . . and people as I have known them. . . . Old Grandpa
Deal with his shaggy head and the twinkle in his eyes, and his
wit and his patience with Grandma . . . the story of my mother
with her head-shawl and her Irish eyes, pulling a rose for my
father . . . Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, trying to make a lady of
her little Irish peasant daughter-in-law . . . the journey out
from Illinois with the stolid old oxen and the smell of the
burning maple boughs in one's nostrils . . . the first lonely
nights of camping in Nebraska with the silence of the stars and
the sky and the shivering of the prairie grass." It was something
she could do. She vaguely sensed her power to construct the
scenes in writing, knew that she possessed the emotions which one
must feel before he can transfer those feelings to another.</p>
<p>It gave her a delightful sense of anticipation on this October
day. With the half-crop husked and in the crib, she could begin
to write down some of the things she desired. It gave her a
feeling of buoyancy that all her hard work could not down,--a
renewal of youthful desires. By careful management she could plan
her time, so that there would be moments each day in which she
could forget everything else and carry out this dream that was as
old as herself. If the results seemed clever--the thought gave
her a warm sensation of pleasure--she would show them to the
children. And then,--if they were good enough,--there were
several ladies' magazines now, which printed such things. How
proud the older children would be of her,--Mack and Margaret,
John and Isabelle.</p>
<p>"Do you think I could, Will?"</p>
<p><i>I'm sure you could, Abbie-girl.</i> Yes, that was the
answer Will would have made. Always kind, always encouraging, he
would have said just that.</p>
<p>In the sheer pleasure which the vision gave her, she pulled
little Grace up to her and hugged her. "Maybe Mother can find
time now to do something she's always wanted to, darling."</p>
<p>Grace, looking over her mother's shoulder, pulled away.</p>
<p>"Look, Mother,--who's that coming?"</p>
<p>Gus Reinmueller was driving away from the front gate, and a
tiny little figure in black, with huge old-fashioned bonnet, was
hobbling up the path between the cedars, half-carrying and
half-dragging an old black valise.</p>
<p>Amazed, and uncertain who her visitor might be, Abbie went out
to meet her. It was Grandma,--Grandma Deal,--eighty years old,
with a thousand wrinkles in her little shriveled brown face.</p>
<p>"Why, Grandma Deal!"</p>
<p>"Well, Abbie, I've come to live with you. I'd rather live with
you than any of my own blood. It won't be long, though. I shan't
last long. Why didn't I die when Pa did? What makes old folks
hang on when they ain't no good any more to their relatives? What
makes my daughters so hard to get along with?"</p>
<p>Abbie could scarcely believe it,--that Grandma Deal had packed
up and come alone out to her. What could she do with her? How
could she take care of her? In kaleidoscopic fashion her thoughts
tumbled about. Why, it was all she could do to help Isabelle at
the Academy, to give John assistance sometimes, look after the
house and farm-work, and take care of little Grace. And this last
plan,--this new thing of writing she was just planning to do.
Why, it would take time to do it! How could she add Grandma Deal
to her burdens?</p>
<p>Grandma stood in the pathway, the old valise by her side.</p>
<p>"Maybe you don't want me?" her voice rose thin and querulous.
"Maybe you're like all the rest of 'em. Maybe I'd better go back.
I won't go back to Regina's though, that's sure."</p>
<p>"Oh, Will, how can I ever take care of her, too?"</p>
<p><i>She's my mother, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p>Abbie put warm, tender arms around the little old black
figure.</p>
<p>"Why, Grandma, how can you think it? You're Will's own mother.
Of course I'll take care of you."</p>
<p>Grandma Deal pulled away and looked around her. "Whatever did
you set out them cottonwoods for? I can't bear that white fuzz
blowin' around. What did you face the house south for?" A
thousand wrinkles in her little thin, brown face, a thousand
worries under the old, rusty, black bonnet.</p>
<p>One arm around the bent, wiry figure, the black valise in the
other hand, Abbie piloted the arrival into the sitting-room,
where Grace was crying silently for fear of the queer little old
woman.</p>
<p>"Why, Grace, this is your own Grandma,--Father's mother, and
she's come to live with us. We'll give you our bedroom, Grandma,
and Grace and I'll go upstairs to sleep."</p>
<p>"What you goin' to put me in a bedroom on the east side for?
Sun's hot there in summer and east winds blow on it in the
winter."</p>
<p>"Well, you try it a while, Grandma, and we'll change the bed
if you're not comfortable. Now, you rest and I'll go out and get
supper." Oh, where would she get the strength to be patient with
Grandma?</p>
<p>Out in the kitchen, she stepped to the side porch and looked
up at the sky beyond the Lombardy poplars. How could she do any
more than she was doing now? Where did a person get help for all
the trials of life? Why must she always be doing something for
some one else? Why had Will been taken away? How could she assume
this added burden without him?</p>
<p>Whether it was of the spirit world, a touch of the
supernatural, the wind in the Lombardys, or only a memory,--she
did not know. But quite distinctly she heard it:</p>
<p><i>I would go on with you . . . remembering. . . .</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c23" id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Grandma Deal lived with Abbie for two years, the last thirteen
months of which she was bedridden, and during which she was
consistent in only one thing,--regularly spending a portion of
each day in wishing she had not come. Abbie washed for her and
ironed for her and cooked as well as she could with a frugal
larder, to satisfy her childish cravings. Sometimes she picked up
the frail little body and carried her to a couch near the window.
And in the two years, she did not leave Grandma with any one else
a half-dozen times. Margaret and Mack and John all scolded about
it. "It seems as though Mother <i>always</i> has some big extra
job on her hands," they would tell each other. Regina, fat and
easy-going, came out once to help with the care, but the
arrangement was not a particularly happy one, inasmuch as Abbie
had two to wait on then, rather than one.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, of the whole family, Grandma took the
greatest liking to the one who did the least for her,--Isabelle.
Dreamy-eyed, thinking of nothing but music, Isabelle seldom did
anything for Grandma but sing for her. Home from the academy that
summer, the girl was expressing her desire constantly for a piano
instead of the old reed organ.</p>
<p>"What you alwa's wishin' for a pianny for when you know you
can't have it?" Grandma wanted to know.</p>
<p>"I might just as well have some fun wishing for it," she
announced pleasantly,--Isabelle was always pleasant,--"when I
know it's as far away as the moon." And she sat down at the old
reed organ and played a windy accompaniment to her thrush-like
singing of "Home to Our Mountains."</p>
<p>Grandma lifted her little wizened face from the clean white
pillow. "Come here," she said suddenly. "Bring me the black bag
out o' my valise, and mind you don't look in it, either."</p>
<p>When Isabelle had brought the bag, Grandma took out a smaller
pouch, and with Isabelle's eyes almost starting from her head,
counted out fifteen great gold double-eagles.</p>
<p>"There's your pianny," Grandma said tartly. "Gold . . . all of
'em . . . and minted in the 'fifties. I'm savin' ten of 'em to
bury me. You tell your Ma. Tell her when I die . . . I want her
to take the money out o' this bag and buy herself a railroad
ticket and go along home with me. I ain't goin' to have no
mistake made. Like's not if she wa'n't along they'd send me on to
Chillicothe or Kalamazoo."</p>
<p>"Oh, Grandma . . ." Isabelle could not yet comprehend the gift
of gold that had come from the Aladdin lamp of the little black
bag. "How can I <i>thank</i> . . . oh, Grandma . . . I
<i>never</i> can thank . . ."</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, Grandma broke into a dry old sobbing. "Don't
thank <i>me</i> . . ." Her voice cracked weirdly. "Thank your
dead father. 'Twas his draft money. I'd never touch it." Her
quavering old voice was torn into hoarse shreds, "Thirty years I
kep' it . . . come in the house 'n' put it in my lap . . . said,
'Mother, there's your money' . . . blood money . . . I alwa's
said 'twas. . . ."</p>
<p>Isabelle was frightened and ran out for her mother.</p>
<p>When Fritz Reinmueller and John, Oscar and Henry Lutz unloaded
the wonderful shining affair at the parlor door, Isabelle would
not have exchanged places with the first lady of the land.
Grandma greeted the purchase with "What'd you get that color for?
Why didn't you get a plush stool? What're you settin' it in
<i>that</i> corner for?"</p>
<p>On a morning in July, Grandma's restless spirit took its
grumbling flight, sputtering a little at the Lord for the time
spent upon her demise. Abbie took a piece of Will's gold draft
money, and with Grace, accompanied all that was mortal of Grandma
back to the old home. "Poor Grandma," thought Abbie on the train,
"I wonder if she's finding fault with the way the angels' wings
are put on and the direction the River of Life flows."</p>
<p>It had been twenty-eight years since Abbie had traveled the
miles toward the setting sun behind old Red and Baldy. After the
services for Grandma, she stayed a week, finding a thousand
changes. But the greatest change of all she found in herself. She
did not like the old places as well as she had always dreamed.
Houses were too thick. Trees were too close and shady. The air
was too humid. She felt hemmed in. "I would want to see out
more," she thought to herself, ". . . to far horizons. I belong
to the prairie. That's home now."</p>
<p>She visited her mother's grave and Grandpa Deal's and the tiny
one of Janet's baby with the wild honeysuckle tangled over it.
Her mother lay under a tall pine on which the dried cones rustled
all the afternoon in the summer breezes. Abbie sat and thought
about her,--the little peasant girl whose life had changed
because a young hunter rode by. She thought of the trail of
graves across the country. Her father was buried in New York
State, a little brother in Illinois, her mother in Iowa, her
husband in Nebraska. A trail of graves marked the westward trek
of her family.</p>
<p>When she got back to town they asked her to guess whoever she
supposed could be there. "Dr. Ed Matthews' wife from New York
City," they told her.</p>
<p>Abbie could not think that it would be so hard to meet any
one. Surely, at forty-seven one did not care about things like
that.</p>
<p>The woman was slender, wasp-waisted, beautifully dressed, her
huge leg-o'-mutton sleeves the height of style. She had on a
whole garnet set, a pin, earbobs and bracelet.</p>
<p>"They tell me you are one of Doctor's old sweethearts." She
smiled at Abbie with her graying hair and her sunburned skin and
her work-worn hands. Abbie's heart was pounding ridiculously.
Certainly at forty-seven one ought to have more poise than that.
She leaned over Grace and fixed her sash. When she raised her
face it was composed. She smiled back, "Oh, he used to come past
the school-house sometimes where I taught . . . and stop to
talk."</p>
<p>When Abbie came back, she stopped in Lincoln a day to visit
Margaret. Fred, Jr. was two years old now, and sitting up to the
table on Gus's and Christine's wedding gift of <i>Twenty Lessons
in Etiquette,</i> but as far as Abbie could see, the association
was a lost cause, for Fred, Jr.,'s table activities were of such
an adventurous type that an onlooker might gather he was sitting
on <i>The Life and Voyages of Columbus.</i></p>
<p>Abbie arrived at the farm to face the utter ruin of her corn
crop. During that week of July in which she had been back to the
old home, the hot winds had blown out of the southwest with their
scorching, blighting breath, and the young, shoulder-high stalks
were so many blistered pieces of pulp.</p>
<p>She had been home two days when Henry Lutz drove out to tell
her that Sarah was not well enough to go to Omaha to be with Emma
during confinement and to ask her to go in Sarah's place. The hot
winds had wearied Sarah, Henry said,--just tired her out.</p>
<p>For a few brief moments Abbie felt a fierce resentment that
Sarah was always so well taken care of. Wasn't it hot for her
too? Just back from burying Grandma, after caring for her two
years, with the chickens and the house and everything to see
to,--wasn't <i>she</i> weary, too? Oh, why could she never live
any life of her own? For a few minutes resentful thoughts tumbled
about in her mind, and then she said cheerfully, "Why, yes, tell
Sarah I'll go."</p>
<p>Mack and Emma had a sturdy little son, now, too,--Stanley,
they called him.</p>
<p>"Another grandson, Will," Abbie said at home again.</p>
<p><i>We're both pleased, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>That fall Abbie put in her first small sowing of winter wheat,
the new experiment about which some of the farmers were talking.
In November, with a light dash of snow on it, the small rectangle
of vivid green stood out on the landscape like a bit of spring
which had lost its reckoning of time. The crop in its
experimental stage did well enough so that she added to her list
a small sowing of the other new one, alfalfa, the tiny
bluish-purple flowers later sending out a haunting fragrance that
vied with the sweet fresh odor of the red clover.</p>
<p>But in general, it was a hard row that Abbie was having to
hoe. Under the best of circumstances, with plenty of man-power on
the farm, the owners were having a series of hard years. For a
woman to face the problems seemed next to impossible. She rented
parts of the eighty to Oscar Lutz and Gus Reinmueller for a share
in the grain. But one year of drought followed another, so that a
share in a poor crop was sometimes next to nothing. Pete and
Heinie Reinmueller worked for her at times on shares. If they
butchered they took their pay in meat, if they cut down trees
they took it in wood. The chickens, the horses and the two cows
she cared for herself, and except at farrowing time, the pigs.
She made butter and sold it to town customers, and she traded
eggs and chickens for staples at the Lutz store. Aside from a
cloak which Mack gave her one Christmas and a dress from
Margaret, Abbie Deal had nothing new in the way of clothes for
years. Every stitch, every penny, every thought was for the
schooling of the children. "If you can help any one, help John
and Isabelle get through school," she would say to Mack and
Margaret. And those who think she was not cheerful through it
all, do not know the Abbie Deals of the old pioneer stock.</p>
<p>She made light of her hard times. "I've worn the same black
hat for so many years," she would say, "it's like an old friend.
The jet ornament on it has gone the whole rounds. It's been sewed
on the front and on both sides and on the back. And now next
year, I'm going to try it sort of northeast between the front and
side."</p>
<p>The Lutz families and the Reinmuellers had gone away beyond
their original ownership of land. Henry and Oscar Lutz had bought
several eighties from families who had given up and returned
East. Gus Reinmueller owned six eighties now, instead of the two
of the earlier days. He and Christine seemed to have a perfect
obsession for adding acres to their possession. Everything went
into more land,--nothing into the house or for the children. The
Henry Lutz family was now the "best fixed" one in Cedartown.
Henry had done well in the store, had bought and sold land by
that sharp businesslike bargaining which brought him always the
better of the trade. Unlike the Reinmuellers, the Lutz family was
the first to get new things and conveniences. Sarah Lutz, with
her little black beady eyes and her still rosy cheeks, was always
well dressed, always merry, always hospitable in the new house
with the fancy wooden rosettes and the stylish cupola.</p>
<p>The year that John finished his law course found an
opportunity presenting itself to locate in Iowa with a friend. He
took the Iowa bar examination and was in the firm by mid-summer.
It seemed queer to Abbie that John should go back to her old
state to live.</p>
<p>That same June, Isabelle finished the Academy, the star pupil
in piano and voice. Abbie in her turned and made-over dress,
sitting in the audience of the church where the exercises were
held, cried a little behind her program, and there are those who
will understand the nature of her tears.</p>
<p>That was the same summer too, that Mack and Emma turned into
the lane on a tandem bicycle one afternoon. Abbie could not
believe her eyes,--that Emma, the mother of a year-old boy, would
pedal from Omaha on one of the mannish-looking things. Emma was
gay and unconcerned about little Stanley. She had left him with
"the girl." He was as "fine as a fiddle" and the girl knew "just
what to do with him." Yes, Emma was going to be as carefree and
irresponsible a person as Sarah, her mother. Dressy, too, like
her mother. She had on a dark green wool skirt, tight-fitting
over the hips and bell-shaped at the bottom. Her white waist had
sleeves the size of smoked hams. She wore a green necktie, and on
top of her huge head of black hair was perched a little creased
felt hat with a green quill at one side,--an "Alpine hat," she
told Abbie. How could a young mother take her duties so lightly,
thought Abbie.</p>
<p>In the fall, Isabelle, dreamy-eyed with musical plans, went up
to Lincoln to live with Margaret and attend the University. Abbie
sometimes opened the sliding double doors and went into the
parlor where the piano stood, silent now, and ran her long
slender fingers, stiff and knotted with outdoor work, over the
keyboard. Sometimes she sighed a little for a lost dream, but
more often she thought only of her pride in Isabelle.</p>
<p>Grace, at eight was in the Cedartown school, quick,
keen-eyed,--"smart as a whip," people said. For two years, Abbie
had hitched up on bad days and taken her in to school, but now a
second building had gone up in the north end of town, and Grace
was no farther away from it than many of the town children. It
lightened Abbie's work materially when Grace could skip off to
school by herself down the lane road under the poplars.</p>
<p>It was not until early winter again, with its half-crop of
husking out of the way, that Abbie turned to that old desire of
hers, that girlish ambition to write some of the things she had
heard and seen and lived.</p>
<p>In that saving, frugal way, born of necessity, she ironed out
dark brown wrapping paper, which she had saved for years, and cut
it into sheets. At forty-nine Abbie was finding her first
opportunity to take time from duties which had always confronted
her, to carry out this old ambition. For several afternoons she
wrote of the things she had been wanting forever to get down on
paper. The things she had wanted to say did not come as readily
as she had always anticipated. The task was a little more labored
than she had thought. When she had finished several of the brown
papers, she put them away carefully in her bureau drawer.</p>
<p>Duties descended upon her again before she had a chance to
read over what she had written--those urgent duties which seemed
always to confront her. Isabelle came home for vacation, burning
incense before Euterpe's shrine. Even as a freshman, she had been
chosen one of the new members in a musical organization, and what
was of more practical benefit, had been asked to sing in one of
the church choirs. Isabelle's fresh mellow voice was the open
sesame to meeting many new friends and experiences.</p>
<p>Christmas came and went with every one, but John, home. On one
of the short January days with the snow thick on the Lombardy
poplars, Abbie, with almost a girlish enthusiasm, took out of the
drawer the story she had written in the fall. She read it through
and then, amazed and chagrined, she read it a second time. It was
flat, insipid. None of the things which she had been thinking as
she wrote, was there. The statements were dull and lifeless.
Grace, at nine, might almost have written them. What was the
matter? She, who had so loved life, and so deeply lived it, could
she not of all people get down on paper that which she had lived
and loved? Apparently not.</p>
<p>How did they do it, she wondered? How did those writers you
loved make you live in their stories? How did their people move
across the pages like flesh and blood friends? How could they
bring tears to your eyes and laughter to your lips? How could the
winds sweep through their books so that you heard its endless
rushing? How could the prairie grass blow for them so that you
saw it wave and ripple? How could the Mayflowers and the
honey-locusts drip their fragrance for them, so that you smelled
it across the years? She did not know.</p>
<p>For some time she sat in stunned disappointment and looked at
the snow thick on the cedars, and the gray bowl of a sky turned
over the world. All her life she had dreamed of constructing
something. She had told herself that if only she could find time,
she would write of life as it was. And she had found time. But
she could not write of life as it was. She had tried to tell of
the journey over the uncharted sea of grass, of the nights under
the star-filled sky, and the winds that were never still. But the
words she had set down had not told it. Only the memory of it
remained in her heart, like a song that would never be sung. She
thought of her younger days,--the gleam which seemed always
ahead,--of the vague allure which accomplishing something in the
arts had always held for her. And now she was nearly fifty and
she was not to know the fruition of any of those hopes.</p>
<p>"Oh, Will, I am so disappointed," she said to that invisible
comrade who was only spirit and memory. "I can only <i>feel</i>
those things,--not do them."</p>
<p><i>Isn't motherhood, itself, an accomplishment?</i></p>
<p>She knew that she made her own answer, and yet it gave her a
sense of satisfaction and peace. Will might have said it. It
sounded like him.</p>
<p>"But I've made so many mistakes . . . Will . . . even in
that."</p>
<p><i>You are a good mother, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p>Yes, it gave her a sense of peace and comfort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c24" id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed to Abbie that the years began to move more quickly
now. The leaves of the almanac over the wooden kitchen sink were
turned with almost unbelievable rapidity. Abbie never tore them
out and never destroyed one of these outlived chronicles of
time.</p>
<p>"Don't you ever burn up any of the old things that have
accumulated?" Isabelle asked when she was home from the
University.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Abbie said hastily.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Oh . . . I don't know. Some one might need them sometime.
I've always found a use for everything." And so every button,
every string, every paper sack was carefully hoarded.</p>
<p>Isabelle was in the second semester of her sophomore year. She
had only two dresses,--her brown school dress and her tan Sunday
one, but she had a knack of wearing them well. It was the Era of
Throttled Throats. Isabelle would pin a long ribbon at the front
of her neck, wrap it tightly several times around that maltreated
part of her anatomy and tie it in a huge bow under her ear.</p>
<p>"It's a wonder it doesn't shut off your epiglottis or whatever
it is you sing with," Abbie said in disgust.</p>
<p>Isabelle was attractive with her reddish-brown hair and eyes
and her mellow voice,--attractive apparently to Harrison Rhodes,
a young man who sang in the same choir with her. When he had been
out to the farm and sung "Whispering Hope," with Isabelle,
looking down at her while she played the accompaniment, Abbie
thought that all who ran could read, and the language of the
message was in that Esperanto, the universal language of
romance.</p>
<p>"But then I'm sort of romantic, Will, and maybe I just imagine
it."</p>
<p><i>I thought so, too, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>In June of that year a national political convention named a
Nebraska man for its presidential candidate. He was defeated in
November, but Abbie said, "At least they know now there are some
states west of the Mississippi."</p>
<p>Letters came from John regularly and Abbie thought to herself,
with no small amount of glee, that John was far more
communicative through the medium of pen and paper than when he
was with her. His firm was "getting along pretty well," although
he himself was not doing much more than the collections and
looking up references. He would be glad when he had a real case.
Later he had joined the local unit of National Guards. They met
and drilled right along. Rather foolish, maybe, when there was no
likelihood of war, but it was good for them, as they were mostly
fellows in offices. His foot bothered him yet sometimes,--a
little stiff after he had drilled.</p>
<p>Peace had been over the land for thirty years,--and then
suddenly there was no peace. Spanish-American controversies,
which had been piling up like so many logs on a pyre, were
touched off by a match of news which flashed across the land. The
<i>Maine</i> had been sunk in Havana's harbor. And in the
wing-and-ell farmhouse behind the cedars, Abbie Deal was reading
a letter from John:</p>
<p>"And so we arrived here in camp Des Moines, Tuesday. It was
the most impressive and magnificent sight I ever saw yesterday
morning when we left. The G.A.R. and band and drum corps escorted
us to the depot, and thousands of people on every side waved
flags and cheered and cried as we marched along. At the station
friends were bidding good-bys, and mothers, sisters and
sweethearts were weeping and saying their farewells. . . . We
arrived in Des Moines and our regiment was quartered in the speed
stables. . . . We have ten box stalls to each company. . . . I
didn't come home first for I didn't want to say good-by to you. I
know how you will feel, Mother. But if you saw a bully licking a
little youngster, you would think I was cowardly, if I didn't
jump in and . . ."</p>
<p>Yes, yes, how the words came back! A boy she knew long ago had
said that same thing.</p>
<p>War! War again! How terrible! O God, stop war!</p>
<p>"Our John's going to war, Will!" Abbie's stiff lips could
hardly frame the words.</p>
<p><i>I would have wanted him to do his duty.</i></p>
<p>And then Abbie could think of almost nothing but her boy;
could do almost nothing but fix things to send him,--cookies, a
cake, a needle-book, a Testament. Always the Abbie Deals must be
doing something for their children.</p>
<p>The letters came frequently. John was willing enough now to
pour out his thoughts to his mother.</p>
<p>"Our regiments commence where the numbers of the regiments of
the Civil War ceased,--that is, the First National Guard (the
regiment our company belongs to) is now the Forty-Ninth."</p>
<p>Why, how terrible! Abbie looked up from her letter. How
terrible that the numbers should go right on. Would they always
go on? Mack's little boy, Stanley,--little Fred Baker, Jr.--four
and six now,--In twenty or thirty years--The idea was
unthinkable. O God, don't let the numbers of the regiments go
right on!</p>
<p>"We found that we all had to submit to another physical
examination by a regular army physician. This was bad news for me
and I feared it on account of the scar on my ankle. A number were
rejected and I was one. . . ." Abbie's heart gave a bound of
relief. John's near-tragedy, then, had been a blessing in
disguise . . . "but another examination before a board of
regimental surgeons passed me. . . ."</p>
<p>And so there was no relief and no blessing,--nothing but
war.</p>
<p>There were other boys of the neighborhood going, too. Fritz
Reinmueller for one. <i>"Ach!</i> Wid plantin' time come,"
Christine said in her half-English. "Such a <i>schlechte</i>
<i>zeit . .</i> . bad time." How queer Christine was,--to think
always of the land and the crops and the money.</p>
<p>It had been in April that John's first letter had come from
the box-stall in the Des Moines speed stable.</p>
<p>On a warm night in May, Isabelle came walking up the lane road
under the poplars. Abbie had not expected her home and she ran to
the sitting-room door with cheery words of greeting. On the porch
steps Isabelle stood and looked at her mother with wide tragic
eyes. Did nothing,--said nothing,--but stood and looked with wide
tragic eyes.</p>
<p>"Isabelle!" Abbie's heart was pounding tumultuously. "What is
it?"</p>
<p>"I'm married." The girl's voice was dull, without
expression.</p>
<p>"Married?" Abbie repeated in a voice equally as dull, and with
equal lack of expression.</p>
<p>Isabelle put out her hand. There was a wide gold band on her
slender finger.</p>
<p>"Last night. And he's gone."</p>
<p>"You mean you're married to . . . to . . . ?"</p>
<p>"He's gone," she repeated dully. There was only one man in the
world, so why name him?</p>
<p>"You married Harrison Rhodes . . . before he left?"</p>
<p>"For San Francisco."</p>
<p>Abbie pulled Isabelle into the house and with shaking hands
took off the girl's hat.</p>
<p>"They'll be sent to the Philippines," Isabelle said in that
same expressionless way. Abbie was trembling in every limb. She
had read about such things happening to other mothers. And now it
was happening to her. She could not think it,--that her own
little Isabelle Deal had married in that hasty manner. Why, she
wasn't even Isabelle Deal,--she was Isabelle Rhodes. Everything
seemed tumbling about Abbie's head,--all her plans for her
musical girl. Why, Isabelle was only finishing her sophomore
year. And then, suddenly, Abbie thought of the pearls lying in
their velvet box in the old calf-skin-covered chest, waiting for
Isabelle to be a bride. For a moment, a great disappointment
overtopped all her other emotions. Oh, why had Isabelle done this
hasty thing?</p>
<p>"Oh, Isabelle . . . without a wedding! I've always wanted
every one of my girls to have a wedding at home."</p>
<p>"Oh, what difference is a <i>wedding?"</i> And Isabelle began
to cry, great wrenching sobs that shook her.</p>
<p>Abbie put comforting arms around her. "There . . . there . . .
dearie. That's right . . . after all . . . what difference
<i>is</i> a wedding?"</p>
<p>"He cared for nothing in the world but me and music," Isabelle
said in her bitterness, "but he went to war."</p>
<p>Abbie held her close, rocked her as if she were a child.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, Isabelle. They care for nothing in the world but
women and their work . . . and they go to war."</p>
<p>Isabelle would not go back to school for the remaining few
weeks of the year. She would only sit at home and wait dully. And
now Abbie had the new experience of attempting to keep another
person courageous. It was more trying than to keep up her own
spirits. Why must she always be strong for other people? How
Isabelle sapped at her strength! She seemed to have no stamina.
Sometimes Abbie thought the girl was selfish in it, and then she
would say. "But I'm her <i>mother.</i> I'm the <i>one</i> for her
to take her troubles to." Abbie had John to think about also. She
felt a little jealous that Isabelle was thinking of Harrison all
the time, when John was in the same danger.</p>
<p>By the middle of June, John, the lawyer, was sweltering at
drill in Camp Libre in Florida; and Harrison, who cared for
nothing in the world but Isabelle and music, was sweltering
before Fort Malati, doing outpost duty.</p>
<p>They came home in the summer of '99. Harrison, who had been in
much action, came home fairly well; John, who had done only camp
and guard duty, came pale, emaciated and weak from typhoid
contracted in Cuba. Harrison and Isabelle made plans to move
immediately to Chicago. Abbie thought she could not stand it,--to
have Isabelle live so far away. Why did children do that? It made
her envy Christine, whose children were all settling down on the
various eighties that Gus had bought,--Heinie here, Emil there,
even Fritz, just home from the Philippines, had married and
started into the field.</p>
<p>Isabelle took the piano. "I hate to, Mother, with Grace eleven
now. It seems selfish."</p>
<p>"No, you take it," Abbie told her. "Grace can't bear to
practice. She just reads and reads. My,--how different you
children all are."</p>
<p>And then it came about that Chicago seemed not far, almost
neighborly, in comparison with John's new location. After
recuperating at home that summer, John left for Seattle and Nome.
Abbie was stunned. Nome,--in Alaska,--from which there could be
no return in the fall after the ice had frozen, from which there
could come no word until late spring when the ice had gone out.
In his characteristic way, John had told his plan casually only a
few days before he left. There was a future in Alaska. It was the
place for young fellows. Fortunes awaited their picking up. He
would open a law office in Nome and keep his eyes open for
anything presenting itself on the side. He was using his army
money for the purpose. How queer, thought Abbie,--just as Will
had taken his army money for the long-ago trip into Nebraska.
Soldiers of fortune, both.</p>
<p>Calm and dry-eyed, Abbie told her son good-by. But all winter,
day and night, her thoughts were with him. Every night when she
was ready for bed she would look over the snow-covered prairie to
the northwest, toward the land to which no word could go,--toward
the land from which no word could come.</p>
<p>It was June before the first of the winter letters came. There
were many. John had written her often. Many nights, then, as she
had stood looking across the snow-wrapped prairie, John had been
writing to her. After all, no distance could sever the tie that
bound them,--nothing come between her and her silent boy. The
letters were of an intense interest to home-keeping
Abbie,--descriptive of the gold rush. Most important of all, John
had been appointed U. S. Commissioner and was going up above the
Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>In the late fall of that year, when Mack's and Emma's boy,
Stanley, was six, a second son was born to them. They named him
Donald. And he immediately upset Abbie's plans for Christmas by
acquiring colic to such a noisy degree that the Mackenzie Deal
family decided to stay in Omaha behind closed doors with their
vociferous offspring.</p>
<p>The annual Deal reunion did not prove so complete a success as
usual with John and Mack's family all absent. Abbie went through
all the preparations for the event, as she always did,--the
pop-corn balls and the taffy candy, the tree and the little
hidden packages, but it was never the same for her when one child
was missing. This was the fourth Christmas John had been away
from them. More than ever, Abbie's thoughts were with John in
that far-off land of the midnight sun, now that he was so much
farther away than Nome.</p>
<p>What was there about John that seemed always to bring her
thoughts of anxiety, Abbie wondered? From the time he was small,
it seemed that she had always thought and prayed more about John
than any of the others. His silence, his independence, his way of
doing things without telling her, worried her. And now in Alaska,
above the Arctic Circle, with no means of communication until the
ice floe should go out,--what was he doing? What were his
experiences? His pastimes? His temptations? What sort of women
was he meeting? Abbie would stop in her work and utter a prayer
for him,--and, sent as it were from the bow of a mother's
watchful care, bound by the cord of a mother's love, the little
winged arrow on its flight must have reached Some
one,--Somewhere.</p>
<p>The Dr. Fred Bakers were out at Christmas. Grace, twelve, and
Fred Jr., eight, were the only children at the Christmas reunion
that year.</p>
<p>Isabelle and Harrison, though, came from Chicago, enthusiastic
over their music. They were both studying and practicing hours
every day, and singing in a suburban church choir. They each had
a few music pupils. Isabelle looked stylish in her brown silk
shirtwaist and wide brown serge skirt with fifteen gores,
stiffened with buckram.</p>
<p>The two stayed a day after the Fred Bakers had gone.</p>
<p>"Don't you get tired of all the extra noise and work, Mother?"
Isabelle wanted to know when they were alone.</p>
<p>"Oh, my! No, dear," Abbie returned. "When you have children,
Isabelle, you'll understand what I mean."</p>
<p>"I might as well tell you now, Mother,--we're not having
children."</p>
<p>"Not . . . <i>what,</i> Isabelle?"</p>
<p>"I'd really rather be honest with you than hear you talk that
way. We're not having a family."</p>
<p>"Why, Isabelle, you talk as though . . . as though . . ."</p>
<p>"But I mean it. We're really not well enough off. You know,
yourself, Mother, that Harrison and I will never be rich and
what's more, neither one of us really cares. Mack has a good
business head on him and is well on the way now to being
well-to-do. Doctor and Margaret seem to have the ability to lay
up treasures where moth can corrupt. No telling what John will
do. He may be a big attorney some day. We don't know Grace's
future when she's only twelve. But all Harrison and I care for is
our art. Music is our very life. Knowing that we're going to be
so devoted to it and perhaps never be well enough off, we're just
not having children."</p>
<p>"But, Isabelle, if people waited to be rich to have children.
If <i>we! . . .</i> Oh, Isabelle! . . . You'd make me laugh if I
didn't feel so like crying. 'Can't afford it?' How can you afford
to <i>miss</i> it . . . little children . . . their soft warm
bodies and their little clinging hands . . . their cunning ways .
. . miss <i>motherhood?"</i></p>
<p>"Of course, I might have known you wouldn't like it . . . but
I want to devote all of my time to my voice. To have children you
ought to have plenty of time and money for their
development."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal looked out of the window, down through the long row
of cedars. "To have plenty of time and money for their
development." Instead of the cedars, heavy with snow, she was
looking into a sod-house where a little painted blackboard stood
against the mud-plastered walls, seeing one shelf of books and a
slate and some ironed pieces of brown wrapping-paper. The mother
there was hearing reading lessons while she kneaded bread, was
teaching songs while she scrubbed, was giving out spelling words
while she mended, was instilling into childish minds, ideals of
honesty and clean living with every humble task.</p>
<p>For a long time Abbie Deal sat and looked out at the cedars
bending under the snow, like so many mothers bending under their
burdens. But she did not answer Isabelle. Maybe there was no
answer. Perhaps there was no argument. She did not know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c25" id="c25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>John's letters came again in the late spring, in them an echo
of the breeze that blows over the Kotzebue Sound. "For Christmas
dinner we had fish balls and egg sauce, baked white-fish,
ptarmigan pot-roast, mashed potatoes, baked dressing, ice cream
from condensed milk, and coffee. After the white people ate, the
Eskimos took turn and made a thorough clean-up. When one of them
found something that struck his palate, he proceeded to devour
the entire contents of the dish. Eighty white people ate and
twenty-five Eskimos. The miners came dressed in their parkas and
mukluks. . . .</p>
<p>"Thermometer has been down to 38 degrees all day, 46 below in
the night. This morning about eleven the ice began moving on the
Keewalik and kept coming all day. There is an ice jam at the
bluffs below town, and a number of cabins are in danger of being
carried away. . . .</p>
<p>"Strike on Kugruh has been confirmed,--the whole river and
benches have been staked."</p>
<p>Abbie, with the letters in her lap, would look out over the
familiar fields, green in their spring wheat and their parallel
rows of young corn, and wonder how a child of the prairie could
have gone so far away.</p>
<p>And now Nature began to seem less parsimonious with her rains.
No longer was the sky a dry blue bowl turned over the dry brown
earth. Heavy with moisture, the clouds gathered and fell in a
blessing of light showers or heavy, soaking rains. Out of
Nature's benediction grew fine crops, better times, high land
prices.</p>
<p>A union of farmers to market their own crops was being formed
in many localities. Abbie took two shares of stock in the
Cedartown Elevator. "It's the beginning of something pretty big,
I believe," she told Mack.</p>
<p>In the fall, Henry Lutz died. And over in the house with the
cupola and the wooden rosettes and the fancy grill-work, Sarah
Lutz clung to Abbie constantly, so there was one more duty at
hand for her. After her father's death, Emma came into the
possession of a large amount of land. Selling here, buying there
with good business judgment, and aided by the upward swing of
prices, Mack, who was now assistant cashier of the bank, placed
the Mackenzie Deal family on the best of financial footing.</p>
<p>One more year went by with John proving his ownership of the
title "Judge Deal" in the land of the dog-team, and then he came
back. In that characteristic way of suddenly doing something with
no preliminary talk, he opened a law office in Cedartown. To
Abbie, it seemed unbelievable and far too good to be true, that
the wanderer of the family should settle down closer to her than
any of the others.</p>
<p>Margaret was painting many canvases every year now. Pencil and
drawing-book with her, she often came out home to wander for
hours in the vicinity, sketching the cottonwoods or the maples or
a rolling bit of pasture land. "When the day comes, Mother," she
would say, "that I can get the light that lies over the prairie
at evening, to suit me, I believe I'll be satisfied."</p>
<p>Isabelle, in Chicago for three years, was forging ahead in her
career, singing at some of the select musical affairs. Abbie's
natural garment of modesty showed large perforations in it, when
it came to anything concerning her children's accomplishments.
More than once she hitched up the old white mare and drove into
the <i>Headlight</i> office to proffer some item about one of her
offspring's achievements.</p>
<p>"The Deals all seem to do things," Abbie heard a visitor to
the community say to Oscar Lutz once. The two men were sitting on
a bench under her kitchen window, before one of the many
neighborhood suppers. Abbie, paring potatoes, could hear every
word of Oscar's reply.</p>
<p>"The children do. Will, himself, was a good man but not much
of a manager. Was always planning some wild scheme for the whole
community. You can't get anywhere if you spread your plans all
out over the whole country. At all the school meetings he talked
about the day when the country school would be graded like the
town. Talked about the day when the roads would be fixed. Had
some fool plan about hauling little stones from the quarry at
Louisville . . . loads of little stones and gravel and running a
roller over 'em. Heard him say once right after a long drought
that Nebraska was the best state in the Union . . . had the best
soil . . . that the day would come that the climate conditions
would change and it would be the most productive of them all.
Talked about trees . . . trees . . . trees. Was as loony as old
J. Sterling Morton himself about setting out timber. Would go
after saplings and cuttings and help haul 'em in for the careless
ones if they'd set 'em out. No, he wasn't lazy . . . lord, no. .
. . Just plannin' fer the whole kit 'n' bilin' of 'em instead of
himself. Carried the whole precinct on his shoulders. Didn't
leave Abbie anything very much besides this one half-section, but
the five children and the good name o' Deal."</p>
<p>Abbie, bending over the potatoes, with the neighbor women
bustling around her, said softly to one they could not see,
"Will, I'm glad,--glad that you left me the children and the good
name of Deal."</p>
<p>John was not much more than settled in his new Cedartown
office when his thirtieth birthday arrived, via the 1902
calendar. Thirty having been the meridian between youth and old
bachelorhood in Abbie's young day, she concluded quite definitely
that he was never going to marry. And as has happened since the
time Naomi's sons appeared before her with Ruth and Orpha, Abbie
was suddenly astounded by John writing her, while on a business
trip, that he was bringing home a bride. She was Eloise
Wentworth, a teacher he had met in Iowa, and they would arrive on
the four o'clock, Saturday.</p>
<p>Abbie sat with the letter in her lap, the world tumbling
grotesquely about her. This bolt from the blue, so characteristic
of John, was hard to realize. A peculiar form of jealousy tore at
her. "I'll bet she did the courting herself," Abbie said grimly,
and was too wrought up to laugh at herself. Why hadn't he picked
out some one she knew? Emma Lutz, Dr. Fred Baker, Harrison
Rhodes,--she had met and known them all before they came into the
family. Why had he done this, anyway? Did he know the girl well?
What was she like? Of all the children, John was the one who had
to be handled with gloves. Would she know how to get along with
him? Why hadn't he married one of the home girls? Why hadn't he
ever mentioned the girl? All at once Abbie began to laugh aloud,
almost hysterically. "I'm talking for all the world like
Grandma," she said. "Oh, I mustn't let myself get like Grandma
Deal."</p>
<p>She never dreaded anything so much in her life as the
prospects of that meeting on Saturday. It took all of her
will-power to set herself in hand to welcome them. She was glad
that Grace was home with her. Grace was fourteen now and in the
Cedartown High School. No longer did children of the community
have to go from home and board at the old Weeping Water Academy,
for the Cedartown High School was now accredited to the
University. Grace was a nice girl and a good student,--efficient,
neat, a little prim. Looking at her sometimes, critically, Abbie
wondered why a keen sense of humor had been omitted from Grace's
makeup. She laughed at a joke when it was in a column duly
labeled as one, and warranted to tickle the risibilities. But
humor, that vague, elusive thing which had pulled Abbie through
many a monotonous day and over many a harsh experience, seemed a
missing ingredient.</p>
<p>The two, Abbie and Grace, met the newly-married couple with
the surrey. Abbie was fifty-five now, her once glorious
reddish-brown hair colorless where it was not gray, her shoulders
drooping, her body rather shapeless.</p>
<p>Eloise was pleasant,--a nice looking young woman with firm
lips. She had on an Alice-blue skirt made the new way with all
the gathers in the back, and dragging a little on the station
platform. A tight silk waist of the same shade with a
cream-colored lace fichu, and a blue hat fitting firmly to her
coils of light hair in the back but protruding fashionably to the
front far over the large roll of a high pompadour, completed her
most up-to-date costume. She met Abbie half-way with cordiality.
She fitted herself into the family, firmly, as though she had
arrived with the preconceived idea that she was going to make the
most of John's mother. Grace took a liking to her immediately.
The two discussed school affairs earnestly, with Grace hanging on
her new sister's every firm word. Abbie, cleaning up the table
and listening to them, said to herself, "For all the world, I
believe she and Grace are two of a kind."</p>
<p>"Mother," Eloise said firmly, after supper when John had gone
over to the office, "I'm going to call you 'Mother' right on the
start and then it won't be hard."</p>
<p>"I hope," said Abbie gently, "it won't be hard to call me
'Mother.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Eloise said firmly. "I'm not going to <i>let</i> it
be hard. That's why I'm beginning at once. Mother, John's and my
marriage is to be different from other marriages."</p>
<p>"How, Eloise?"</p>
<p>"Because I'm going at it in a businesslike, systematic
way."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Abbie, "that's a good way."</p>
<p>"I'm going to make our home a well-organized place of rest and
peace for John."</p>
<p>"That will be nice."</p>
<p>"You see mistakes on all sides and <i>I'm</i> not going to
make any."</p>
<p>"No," said Abbie, "of course you won't."</p>
<p>"I've been reading everything on the subject and I <i>know</i>
that I'm well prepared."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Abbie meekly, "I think you are."</p>
<p>"She has everything, Will," Abbie said to the spirit who was
comrade and confidante, "education, looks, high ideals,
efficiency,--everything but a sense of humor. And oh, Will,
<i>how</i> John will miss it."</p>
<p><i>He admires her, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>"And loves her, Will, and love covers many things."</p>
<p>The next year Abbie sold the rest of the acreage to Gus
Reinmueller, retaining the five acres which contained the house
and out-buildings, the orchard and one pasture. Gus paid twelve
thousand dollars for it, giving four thousand in cash and an
interest-bearing note. "Now we can plan for Grace to go to the
University," Abbie said. "Grace wants to be a teacher and now I
can help her."</p>
<p>Now that the land was sold, Abbie did not have to think of the
responsibility of the crops, but her hands were still busy with
chickens, and pigs and the cow. She drove a sorrel mare now back
and forth, attending everything that went on in Cedartown, which
she felt would benefit her mentally, and she did not miss a
church service or Ladies' Aid. One of the attractions that
summer, which she and Grace patronized, was an entertainment in
the opera house, purporting to be a sort of magic-lantern show in
which the people in the picture would move about as they were
thrown on the sheet.</p>
<p>"It may be true," Abbie admitted, but added with frank
suspicion that there was probably a catch in it somewhere.</p>
<p>The program opened with a piece by the Cedartown orchestra.
Probably the Boston Symphony could have done as well, but old
Charlie Beadle, who was leader and drummer, would not have
admitted it. A male quartet next sang, "Out on the Deep When the
Sun Is Low." One gathered the rather disquieting impression from
their forlorn and hopeless tones that there was small prospect of
ever seeing the center of the solar system again. Miss Happy Joy
Hansen then spoke "The Raggedy Man, He Works for Paw," with so
much childish lisping and so much coy twisting of an imaginary
apron, that one never in the world could have guessed her age,
unless he had known, as all Cedartown did, that, neither happily
nor joyously, would she ever, ever again see thirty-two.</p>
<p>And then, the picture. The male quartet, having apparently
recovered from the sad effects of the setting sun, launched forth
into a spirited presentation of "When Kate and I Were Coming
Through the Rye." A field of grain was plainly visible on the
cloth, and, incredulous as it seemed, it waved and jerked and
twitched. Kate came into sight, and, unbelievable as it was, Kate
also waved and jerked and twitched. A young man close behind her,
with every indication of St. Vitus' Dance, also waved and jerked
and twitched. But they moved. The advertisement had not lied.
Across the sheet the people moved. "Dear, dear," Abbie said on
the way home. "What next can they do? There's just nothing now
left to be invented, Grace."</p>
<p>Late that fall, Abbie helped organize a Woman's Club. "I don't
know that we will do a great deal of good, but we won't do any
harm, and much of life is an experiment, anyway."</p>
<p>Christine was disgusted when Abbie told her. "A club!
<i>Ach!</i> for what? To hit mit?"</p>
<p>On the very day in which Abbie drove home with the office of
second vice president of the Cedartown Woman's Club upon her
shoulders, a touch of the old raw prairie days presented itself
like a bit of the past. She met Oscar Lutz with a wild deer which
he had shot and killed in the timber a mile east of Stove
Creek,--a young buck that, quivering and at bay, seemed the last
survivor of his comrades that had once roamed the east-Nebraska
country.</p>
<p>Grace graduated from High School when Abbie was fifty-eight.
She gave the valedictory for her class, an earnest if youthful
dissertation on "Heaven Is Not Reached by a Single Bound."</p>
<p>The Sunday after the exercises, all of the children, but
Isabelle, were home for dinner. At the table Mack said: "Mother,
you ought to offer the place for sale right away to get a buyer
by fall. It will make some farmer who wants to retire, a mighty
good place,--a nice little five-acre tract with the orchard and a
pasture and all."</p>
<p>"I would have before this," Abbie admitted, "but I haven't
been real sure in my mind that I'd leave at all."</p>
<p>They all voiced the same sentiment, "Oh, yes, Mother, you
ought to move to Lincoln with Grace."</p>
<p>"There's no real use for your staying."</p>
<p>"With Grace gone, just think how lonesome you'll be."</p>
<p>Dr. Baker and Margaret were willing to have Grace and her
mother live with them just as Isabelle had done for those two
years. The Bakers had been married fifteen years now. Dr. Baker's
firm was a leading one, Dr. Baker himself prominent in his
profession. They had a nice comfortable home. Lincoln was a
city.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I wouldn't want to do that," Abbie said. "Not
<i>both</i> of us. That would be one too many, anyway. If I go,
Grace and I will have a little place of our own."</p>
<p>That set them off on another tangent. There were nice cottages
going up everywhere, several attractive ones of the new type
called bungalows.</p>
<p>Before they left, they went over all the arguments for
selling. "The place is too big for you, Mother. What do you need
of a yard this size? Or a house with this many rooms? Or a barn?"
Their talk was sensible. All the arguments seemed on their side.
"And above all the reasons, is the one that it's going to be
lonesome for you here." They were unanimous in that opinion of
their mother's coming loneliness.</p>
<p>Abbie thought about it a great deal that summer before it was
time for Grace to go. At times she decided that she was foolish
to stay in the old place. The children were right. It was only
old-fashioned, narrow people who never made a change. She
believed she would go up to Lincoln and look at cottages. In the
city there would be a larger life for her, new contacts,
opportunities to see and hear better things. Just as she had half
reconciled herself to the plan, she would walk down the path
between the cedars, which she and Will had set out, look at her
hollyhocks and delphinium, blood-red and sea-blue against the
white pickets, stand for a time and gaze over toward the heavy
fringe of willows and oaks and elms along Stove Creek. Everything
looked familiar,--friendly. There would never be another real
home for her. Home was something besides so much lumber and
plaster. You built your thoughts into the frame work. You planted
a little of your heart with the trees and the shrubbery.</p>
<p>It was the only old home the children had ever known. There
ought to be a home for children to come to,--and <i>their</i>
children,--a central place, to which they could always bring
their joys and sorrows,--an old familiar place for them to return
to on Sundays and Christmases. An old home ought always to stand
like a mother with open arms. It ought to be here waiting for the
children to come to it,--like homing pigeons.</p>
<p>On the next Sunday Abbie was ready with her decision. "No,
I've decided. I'm going to stay here. This is my home."</p>
<p>They went over all the arguments again. "The place is too big
for you, Mother. What do you need of a house this size? Or a
barn? And above all, with Grace gone, it will be too lonely for
you here. . . ."</p>
<p>Abbie looked beyond the poplars, stared for a moment beyond
the Lombardy poplars into the deepening prairie twilight.</p>
<p>"No," she said quietly, "you wouldn't understand. It won't be
lonely here."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c26" id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>That fall after Grace went away to school, John's and Eloise's
first child was born.</p>
<p>"You'll want me to come, won't you?" Abbie had asked Eloise
with her usual desire to be helpful.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Eloise had said hastily,--a little too hastily.
"John wants me to have a <i>trained</i> nurse,--the very
best."</p>
<p>Little hurts! Little pleasures! How they made up the whole of
Abbie Deal's life.</p>
<p>Eloise named the boy Wentworth, and proceeded to bring him up
by the ritual of a red volume in which she held implicit and
humorless faith.</p>
<p>"It would make a dog laugh, Will," Abbie said at home to that
invisible comrade who was only spirit and memory. "He was crying
and she ran and got the little red book and looked up something
in the index. I went over and picked him up and it was nothing
but a safety-pin sticking him."</p>
<p>That was the fall, too, in which Cedartown was astonished and
entertained by the spectacle of Mack Deal and Emma with the two
boys coming to town in one of the new automobiles. The noisy
approach was borne in upon the ears of the residenters some time
before the machine's actual appearance, so that a welcoming
committee, in the form of a large delegation of the citizens, was
on hand to greet the proud owners.</p>
<p>Mack and the ten-year-old Stanley were on the front seat. Mack
at the wheel, eyes bulging and elbows out at right angles, looked
neither to the right nor the left as he piloted the popping,
sputtering land craft through the choppy seas of a rough road.
Emma, in the back seat with the four-year-old Donald, was in a
state of perpetual motion, caused by dividing her frantic
clutches between her youthful offspring and her large flapping
hat, wound round with many yards of veiling. Through town and to
his mother's house, Mack and his new possession were followed by
a cavalcade of interested, not to say envious spectators. The
crowd surrounded him when he pulled up in front of the small
gate, Mack having decided that he would not try to navigate the
lane road, with the eventual possibility of his inability to turn
around or back out.</p>
<p>The machine, as red as Oscar Lutz's thrasher, was almost
immodest in the exposure of its many complicated internal
workings. There were wicker baskets along the side, which Mack
explained to inquirers were for picnic lunches. There were a
hundred other questions he was required to answer. Yes, he had
bought the windshield and the lights extra. Thought he might just
as well get everything while he was about it. Only thing he
hadn't bought was a top. They cost a lot more and anyway it was
so much harder to run the things with one on. You could get them
put on later any time you wanted to. Yes, he had come the
forty-six miles in three and one-half hours. At which almost
incredible statement, there was a shaking of heads and murmured,
"Gosh, . . . almost fifteen miles an hour."</p>
<p>All of the boys and most of the men in Cedartown visited the
exhibit during the day, and a large aggregation was on hand to
see the departure at four in the afternoon, the time Mack had set
for leaving, so that they could get back to Omaha before they
would have to light the carbon lamps in front.</p>
<p>The next year Abbie had five grandchildren, instead of four,
for Mack and Emma were the parents of a girl, whom they called
Katherine. There was considerable rejoicing in all branches of
the family, for this was the first girl among the five small
cousins.</p>
<p>Emma was back at her social activities soon after the baby's
advent, much to Abbie's uneasiness. "Emma certainly takes her
duties lightly," Abbie would say to Margaret, who was her
confidant in all the daughter-in-law gossip. "She and Eloise
ought to be shaken up in a hat. Emma is too easy about it all for
any use, and Eloise makes such hard work of it, that it's painful
to see her."</p>
<p>Near the close of her University course, Grace came home one
Friday evening, ate supper with her mother and wiped the dishes
for her, remarking quite casually, "Mother, Wilber Johnson, the
engineering student I told you about, asked me to marry him."</p>
<p>Abbie, who was cutting bacon in readiness for breakfast,
nearly cut a finger in her surprise and excitement.</p>
<p>"Why, Grace . . . and you've kept it from Mother two hours . .
. you rascal! Well, he's a nice boy, I'm sure. I knew his father
and mother years ago and better people never lived. She came as a
bride to the half-section across the creek from us . . . where
Fritz Reinmueller lives now. She could hardly help but have a
fine son. Well . . . well . . . <i>my baby!</i> I can't
<i>think,</i> Grace, that you're twenty and old enough to know
your own mind. How soon the years go by. . . . It's the right
way, though, and the natural one. . . . I'll be glad to see you.
. . ."</p>
<p>"Goodness, Mother, stop and listen. . . . I'm not going to
marry him."</p>
<p>"You're not?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course not. I didn't say so. I just said he asked me
to. I wouldn't <i>think</i> of it."</p>
<p>"Then you don't love him?"</p>
<p>"Of course not."</p>
<p>"That <i>is</i> a joke on me . . . going on that way. He's
such a nice boy and his folks are so nice and well fixed. I guess
I never gave it a thought but that you meant you wanted to marry
him."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't. I don't feel a bit like it."</p>
<p>"That's all right, dearie. I know just how you feel. He isn't
the one, is he? But you just wait. There will be some one,--and
then you can wear the pearls I've been keeping all this time for
one of my girls to wear. I'm glad you know your own mind. Lots of
girls don't. They just marry the first man that asks them. But
you're a strong character, Grace, and I'm glad of it. One of
these days the right one will come along. I've got a little poem
in my scrap book that says:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Asleep, awake, by night or day,<br>
The friends I seek are seeking me;<br>
No wind can drive my bark astray,<br>
Nor change the tide of destiny.<br>
The stars come nightly to the skies.<br>
The tidal wave unto the sea,<br>
Nor time, nor space, nor deep nor high<br>
Can keep my own away from me.</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>You just think of it that way and one of these days you'll
meet the right man."</p>
<p>Grace seemed a little impatient. "Oh, Mother, I don't know
that I want to."</p>
<p>"Want to what, Grace?"</p>
<p><i>"Ever</i> marry."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you do. Just now after this little affair you don't
think so. But you will, Grace, you just wait."</p>
<p>In 1909 Grace graduated from the University with Phi Beta
Kappa honors, secured a good high school position farther out in
the state, and was not home until the annual Christmas reunion.
When she came home she seemed to have developed a maternal
attitude toward her mother which was paradoxically pleasing and
irritating to Abbie. She was pleased that Grace was thoughtful
and considerate of her, irritated that she began to think of her
as old.</p>
<p>"Mother, you ought to take a nap every afternoon," Grace would
say didactically. To which Abbie would retort, "I'm not exactly
feeble yet, Grace." Or, "Mother, there's a splendid new book on
avoiding old age. You ought to read it."</p>
<p>"I'm only sixty-two, Grace, and I don't see any signs of
senility. You can't avoid old age, but you don't need to think
about it."</p>
<p>A week after she came home at the close of her spring term,
Grace went away to summer school. There was not a lazy bone in
Grace's body, Abbie often said. She was energetic, efficient.
Sometimes, watching her or thinking about her in the way Abbie
was always watching or thinking about the children, she wondered
if Grace was not just a bit hard, just a trifle unsympathetic.
She seemed to have no patience with inefficiency, no time for any
one who was not succeeding.</p>
<p>Abbie was ashamed of herself that she did not get more comfort
and companionship out of Grace. She loved her with her whole
being, but they seemed to antagonize each other at times. She
sometimes admitted reluctantly to herself that Grace was not the
daughter which she had dreamed she would be,--a daughter to sit
and talk, a companion with whom to hold long discussions. She was
too energetic to sit quietly anywhere, and whenever the two held
any discussions they usually ended in Abbie having her feelings
hurt.</p>
<p>Grace was always impatient with the old order of things,
always so sure of herself, so certain that one could accomplish
in this world whatever task he set himself to do. Her
conversation was always dotted with the words "progress,"
"efficiency," "ideals." She spoke of everything in generalities:
Citizenship, economics, causes, rights. Abbie was all for the
individual. "Yes, but old Mrs. Newsome, Grace. How about
<i>her?</i>" She could not think of people in masses. A great
sympathy would surge up in her heart for the one whom life had
used harshly. But when she would express herself, she would be
met with a flood of information from Grace, a flat statement of
statistics, before which she would be compelled to retire
ignominiously.</p>
<p>"Why, I'm glad she's that way," Abbie would say to herself.
"She's smart, Grace is. And she's only twenty-two. When you get
older, you get more sympathetic with the underdog. When you grow
out of your youthful years you have more charity for folks who
haven't succeeded." It was so characteristic of
Abbie,--charity,--charity that vaunteth not itself and is
kind,--that she could not see how others could ever leave it out
of their make-up.</p>
<p>In the last of the summer Grace was home again, having made
several credits toward her master's degree. She was energetic
even in the heat, ready to help with the work, full of plans for
improving the house. "Dear, dear," Abbie said to herself, "Grace
is so energetic, she is like the wind,--so active that she's
tiresome."</p>
<p>It was during these weeks of activity that Grace decided to
have an afternoon party for her mother,--some friends out from
Cedartown and two or three from Lincoln,--women whom Abbie had
met and enjoyed at Margaret's and at Sarah Lutz's. Abbie was
pleased with the idea. It was kind of Grace to do this for her.
"I suppose I would never get around to do it," Abbie admitted to
herself. "That's one thing about Grace, she does get things
accomplished."</p>
<p>Abbie made out her list, and Grace looked it over preparatory
to inviting the guests.</p>
<p>"Mother, you're not going to have Christine Reinmueller?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I am, Grace." Abbie was sure of herself.</p>
<p>"Not with those Lincoln women. I wouldn't care if it were just
the Cedartown people. But not with those Lincoln women and
especially not with Mrs. Wentworth. Whatever would <i>she</i>
think of Christine?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure, Grace, I can't help <i>what</i> Eloise's mother
would think of her!"</p>
<p>"I don't see how you can be so friendly with Christine,
anyway. She's so Dutchy and so narrow and so ignorant."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal set her mouth to keep it from trembling. Loyalty .
. . it was the very fiber of her. In that swift flight of memory
with which the human mind can make a non-stop journey across the
years, she heard: "Hold-tight. Get the ground up. You die already
yet. <i>Du narr!</i> Ya . . . you like dat dyin' . . . maybe."
She opened her eyes to the odor of steam, onions, hot water,
flannels, to the sight of the homely red face of Christine by her
bed, nodding,--jerking up,--nodding--</p>
<p>"Why, Grace!" Because she was so thoroughly agitated she said
it mildly. "Why, Grace, she saved our lives . . . yours and mine.
. ."</p>
<p>"I realize it, Mother. I've heard all that a hundred times.
But, heavens . . . is the debt never paid?"</p>
<p>To keep herself cool and poised and her lips from trembling,
Abbie rose and started into the next room. In the doorway she
turned.</p>
<p>"Never!" said Abbie Deal. "Never!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c27" id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The same summer that Sarah Lutz went abroad with Emma, Abbie
spent her spare time building the seat under the cedars. This was
her sixty-sixth summer. She had almost finished her sawing and
pounding on a warm August afternoon, when she looked up to see
Sarah driving into the lane road in her electric car.</p>
<p>Abbie's gray hair was stringing over her face,--perspiration
on her forehead.</p>
<p>Sarah piloted the car, which she had dubbed Napoleon, up to
the Lombardys, where Napoleon, with his usual caution, refused to
climb a little rise in the ground. Sarah looked "dressy." She had
on a lavender summer silk, little amethysts in her ears.</p>
<p>"Well, Sarah . . . you've been to London. And what did you do
there?"</p>
<p>"Abbie, I frightened a little mouse under the chair." Sarah
kissed Abbie, held her close for a moment. What good old friends
they were! And how they understood each other.</p>
<p>"Abbie Deal, whatever are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Sarah Lutz, I do hate to start anything I can't finish, but
if old Asy Drumm was alive I'd have him here on the dog
trot."</p>
<p>"But what <i>is</i> it?"</p>
<p>"It's a seat."</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"To sit on. I suppose you've grown so high-faluting in your
travel, Sarah, that you think a seat ought to be a
Louis-something <i>objet d'art,</i> as the magazines say. Well,
it isn't. It's to sit on. I've been on the go for sixty-six years
and now I'm going to sit down a little, and I can't think of a
place I'd rather sit than here where I can look off to the
fertile fields that have come out of the old rolling
prairie."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> pleasant, Abbie. There's something about it, . .
. after all my trip . . . the wide stretches of view . . . the
way the rolling land meets the blue sky. . . . Well, it calls you
back . . . the prairie does, just as the sea calls the fisher
folk."</p>
<p>And then Christine Reinmueller turned into the driveway,
trudging along in the inevitable blue calico, gathered full at
the waist, her little greasy braids of hair plaited flat from ear
to ear. Because she had looked so old when she was still young,
Christine seemed to have changed less than the others. There was
something ageless about her. As she had had no youth, she now had
no age.</p>
<p>"Well, girls, here we all are."</p>
<p>For a long time the three "girls" sat under the trees and
visited,--Abbie Deal and Sarah Lutz and Christine
Reinmueller,--Abbie, the motherly home woman,--Sarah, who loved
dress and travel,--Christine, with no thought but the
accumulation of the land. Three varying personalities they
were,--held together by a strange tie of memory,--friends,
because on a long-ago hot summer day, three covered wagons in a
long straggling line lurched over the prairie together.</p>
<p>When John's and Eloise's son Wentworth was nine, they welcomed
a daughter, whom they named Laura, and whom Eloise proceeded to
bring up by the ritual of a blue book, child training fads having
changed, and the old red book of Wentworth's baby days having
become a back number.</p>
<p>Abbie had six grandchildren now. Mack's sons, Stanley and
Donald, were twenty and fourteen. Stanley, having graduated from
an Omaha High School, was East, at Dartmouth, and Mack and Emma
were talking of sending Donald to a select school for boys. "He
needs culture and poise," Emma explained to Abbie.</p>
<p>"Dear, dear," said Abbie, "culture and poise! At his age, his
father needed clothing and provender."</p>
<p>Emma laughed. That was one thing about Emma,--she was like
Sarah, her mother, good-natured, ready to laugh at herself as
readily as at another. Abbie felt as close to her as to her own
girls.</p>
<p>Katherine, Mack's little daughter was eight,--an active child,
always on tiptoe like some gay sprite, too full of the joy of
living to settle down.</p>
<p>Fred Baker, Jr., was twenty-two, already taking a medical
course, with that characteristic following of his father which a
doctor's son seems so often to possess.</p>
<p>As for Abbie's sons, themselves, they progressed. Mack, who
had been in the bank twenty-seven years, was now a heavy
stock-holder. John did law work for half the county.</p>
<p>The old Weeping Water Academy, closed now in 1915, its
usefulness over. High Schools, accredited to the University, were
accessible to every boy and girl. The state owned nearly two
million acres of school land, which, under the law, could not be
sold. And it held first place in literacy.</p>
<p>The summer Abbie was seventy was the one in which the children
planned an intensive campaign against her staying longer in the
old home.</p>
<p>"We've just got to take things in our own hands," they told
each other. "Mother's fairly well, but no woman of seventy ought
to live alone like this on the edge of town."</p>
<p>"Why hadn't she?" Abbie Deal asked. "What's the dif-ference .
. . the <i>edge</i> of town or the <i>middle</i> of town?"</p>
<p>They talked it over,--she might have a room at John's in
Cedartown. Then she would not be so far from old friends. "If she
lives with me," Eloise informed them firmly, "I shall take it
upon myself to see that she gets the right balance in her meals,
and the right number of hours of sleep. I've always thought
Mother Deal ate more protein and less carbohydrates than she
should, and she gets up too early for a woman of her age."</p>
<p>"So I'm to be brought up according to a <i>green</i> book, I
expect," Abbie Deal said grimly to herself.</p>
<p>"I think my home is the natural place," Margaret told them.
"I'm the oldest daughter and Mother is as interested in my oil
work as I am."</p>
<p>"We've got such a lot of room," Mack put in. "I don't know
what a person wants so much for, anyway. But now that we've got
it, I wish Mother would come with us and help fill it up. What do
you say, Em?"</p>
<p>Good-natured Emma was willing, although she reserved certain
secret doubts over the compatibility of Mother Deal and
eleven-year-old Katherine.</p>
<p>Isabelle's Chicago apartment was permanently out of the
competition. But there remained one other plan. Grace could give
up her work and come home.</p>
<p>"I'll be willing to, Mother, if you just <i>won't</i> consent
to leaving. I'd come right in and take charge of everything."
Grace's sense of organization, like a pointer, was already
scenting out a dozen little hidden plans. And her
forty-horse-power energy was already tiring Abbie. "I'd turn the
parlor into a room for Mother and take her bedroom for mine. Then
I'd be down here close to her. I'd get a tea-cart in case she
needed a meal in her room. . . ."</p>
<p>"And you could wheel the chickens in, on the wheelbarrow, for
me to feed," Abbie retorted. Now she ought not to have said that,
she was thinking. Why, she ought to be thankful they were so
kind. How many mothers could have that number of good homes at
their disposal? But she did resent being planned about and talked
over. After all they were her children. In spite of their years,
she was still their mother. She had never let them run over her
and she wasn't going to now. When they had quite definitely
decided on Margaret's home for her, she spoke up:</p>
<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind. I'll stay right here. And kindly
let me alone. Because a woman is getting old, has she no
rights?"</p>
<p>Eloise was almost openly relieved. Emma knew in her heart that
the possibility of certain dramatic situations between the rather
high-strung Katherine and her grandmother were now permanently
avoided. Grace admitted to herself that it would have been more
of a sacrifice for her to give up her work than the others could
dream; and Margaret, with a slight sinking sensation, pondered
for a moment over the mental picture of the marble-topped stand,
the blue plush album and the patent swinging-rocker, rubbing
elbows with the furnishings of her artistic house.</p>
<p>So they "let her alone." But from that time on they said among
themselves that mother was childish, that you had to overlook an
elderly woman's vagaries, and that they must drive in more
frequently to watch her so that no harm would come to her.</p>
<p>When Wentworth was thirteen, and Laura four, John's and
Eloise's third child was born. It was a boy and they named him
Millard. John telephoned the news to his mother, who was now
seventy-one. Abbie hung up the receiver, put on her hat,--a new
one since the demise of the rusty black with the itinerant
ornament,--and walked over to Cedartown. She could not wait
longer to see the baby. She had borne six children, herself, and
this was her seventh grandchild, but she experienced that same
excited interest over its advent she had known at all of those
other times. The first thing she saw when she entered the house
was a new book on child rearing lying on the table,--a
<i>brown</i> book.</p>
<p>"Mother, you shouldn't have done this," John was
half-provoked. "I would have come out to get you."</p>
<p>"I am a little tired, I'll admit, but as long as I've got two
good . . . well, we used to say limbs . . . but they're legs now,
so I'll says 'legs,' . . . I'm not going to lose the use of them
if I can help it."</p>
<p>She held the baby (to Eloise's discomfiture, for it said not
to do so on page nineteen), turned it to the light . . . said she
saw a little of Eloise about its mouth, John in the shape of its
head, something of Laura, and even, by some wild stretch of
imagination, a look of its great-grandfather Deal around the
eyes.</p>
<p>Eloise, weak and nervous, was complaining about her help. The
maid was cleaning and cooking all right but she did not know how
to handle Laura.</p>
<p>Immediately Abbie was offering: "Let me take Laura home,
Eloise. I'd like to so well. I'll take good care of her for a
week or so . . . as long as you'll let her stay."</p>
<p>Eloise was a little dubious about the proposition and took no
pains to hide it. "What do you think, John?"</p>
<p>"I'm wondering if Mother ought to. She's seventy-one,
Eloise."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not of your mother I'm thinking." No, it would not
be of her mother-in-law that Eloise would be thinking.</p>
<p>"Well, you folks decide." Abbie slipped out into the other
room. But Eloise was one of those quaint souls who think that
because a woman is old she is also deaf, and her voice carried
very clearly to Abbie:</p>
<p>"It's Laura, herself, I'm thinking about. You know, yourself,
John, that your mother is terribly old-fashioned. And I don't
know just whether to . . . well, <i>trust</i> Laura with her that
long. She thinks every one ought to drink sassafras tea in the
spring. She would still use goose-grease on a child's neck for
colds and wrap a flannel around it." Abbie heard John's low
chuckle.</p>
<p>"And do you know what I heard her say?" She was earnest and
serious. "She actually said, John, that a <i>red</i> flannel was
better."</p>
<p>John laughed aloud. "Oh, Eloise, you never did quite
understand Mother. That was a joke."</p>
<p>"Well, I must say I can't always tell when she's joking,
then."</p>
<p>But, between the devil, rather mildly represented by the maid,
and the deep sea, quite definitely represented by her
mother-in-law's out-of-date notions about children, Eloise chose
what seemed the lesser of the two evils, and packed Laura home
with her grandmother.</p>
<p>Abbie and the maid and John picked out the things which the
triumvirate thought Laura would need during the stay, materially
assisted by the traveler, herself, who put in a few choice
articles in the way of a one-eyed doll, some red beads in a
bottle and a tooth of her dog which had been presented to her by
the veterinarian and which had escaped the sanitary eye of her
mother.</p>
<p>John drove out home with them, let them out under the Lombardy
poplars, and took the little bag up to the screened-in porch. And
if Eloise could have known the supreme faith and confidence with
which her husband was looking upon the situation she would have
been attacked by the little green god of jealousy.</p>
<p>Abbie led Laura by the hand up the steps of the porch. It was
not possible to say which was looking forward to the visit the
more,--the guest or hostess. For Abbie, with Laura's little warm
hand in hers, was happy almost to the point of excitement. No,
Abbie Deal would never get over being a mother.</p>
<p>"We'll gather the eggs first," Abbie's voice held all the
notes of interest which an anticipated journey might have brought
forth. "And feed the chickens and then we'll have a little
supper."</p>
<p>"What will we have, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll have . . . we'll have . . . What would you like . .
. nice fresh eggs boiled in Grandma's new little kettle . . . or
some creamed toast . . . or baked potatoes . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Mother doesn't let me eat potatoes at night."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. That's all right. We'll do as Mother wishes."</p>
<p>"What are you smiling at, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"I guess I was just smiling to think how nice it is that you
have so many things to choose from for your meals. You see when
my children were little, it was so hard to get enough food for
them, that <i>anything</i> agreed with them."</p>
<p>They gathered the eggs. ". . . in the very same egg pail your
papa used to gather them," Abbie told Laura. And the child gazed
with awe at the antique which had been saved from an age that
seemed as remote to her as the one in which Noah's ark figured.
They fed and watered the chickens. ". . . and see, . . . every
time they take a drink they look up and thank God for it," said
Abbie Deal, with a fine disregard for natural science and a
sublime faith in her fowls' morale. They ate supper. ". . . and
now, you'll wipe the dishes when Grandma washes them, . . ." with
Laura excited beyond measure at the unusual confidence placed
upon her close associations with chinaware.</p>
<p>Afterwards they went out on the porch and Abbie held the
little girl on her lap. She cuddled her up and put her wrinkled
cheek against the child's firm one. Oh, why didn't mothers do it
more when they had the chance? What were clubs and social affairs
and freedom by comparison? And what <i>was</i> freedom?</p>
<p>"Tell a story now, Grandma."</p>
<p>"A fairy one or a real one?"</p>
<p>"A real one about when you were little."</p>
<p>"Well, when I was a little girl . . ." Laura wiggled with
contentment. "When I was a little girl I had a doll and you never
could guess what it was made out of."</p>
<p>"No . . . what was it made out of, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"A stone . . . and it had a little round stone head. . .
."</p>
<p>Yes, Abbie Deal was contented,--as contented as countless
mothers, in a rather topsy-turvy world, are still contented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c28" id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And now war again,--war, spreading its fear and heartaches
like the circling ripples of a wave to the most remote farms
beyond the tiniest village. And in the old farmhouse behind the
cedars Abbie had said good-by to young Dr. Fred Baker and Stanley
Deal, her two oldest grandsons, looking big and fine in their
khaki.</p>
<p>"You know, Grandma, from the time Germany ran over little
Belgium, . . ."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't want us to stand by and let a bully . . ."</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the words came back,--the same words,--the same
spirit. How the clock hands went around.</p>
<p>She saw them drive down the lane road, saw them turn at the
big gate, through which they had so often come to play, and wave
their khaki hats gayly. The wind was blowing from the east and
the cedars bent before it,--blowing from the east like the breath
of the war god. And Fred and Stanley were waving their hats gayly
back to her, while the cedars bent and the wind blew from the
east. They were like her own boys marching off to war. Children
of her children, she loved them as she had loved their parents.
Did a woman never get over loving? Deep love brought relatively
deep heartaches. Why could not a woman of her age, whose family
was raised, relinquish the hold upon her emotions? Why could she
not have a peaceful old age, wherein there entered neither great
affection nor its comrade, great sorrow? She had seen old women
who seemed not to care as she was caring, whose emotions seemed
to have died with their youth. Could she not be one of them? For
a long time she stood in the window and looked at the cedars
twisting before the east wind, like so many helpless women
writhing under the call from the east.</p>
<p>All during those following strenuous months she felt almost as
though the very outcome of the struggle depended upon her
individual efforts. So she knit at home and at the G.A.R. hall,
bought a liberty bond whenever she could, and conserving
everything, ate frugally. And prayed,--prayed that right would
prevail.</p>
<p>Fate willed that Fred Baker, Jr., and Stanley Deal should come
back to their people from overseas. Young Dr. Fred went into
partnership with his father, immediately; and Stanley, after a
three-month' period of recuperation, took back his old job in the
bank.</p>
<p>Grace was teaching now in Wesleyan University. Life was still
real and life was still earnest to Grace, splitting an infinitive
one of its cardinal sins.</p>
<p>At thirty she received her second proposal of marriage from
one of the younger college professors,--and refused him. Abbie
was deeply concerned about it.</p>
<p>"Are you certain, Grace, you don't love him?"</p>
<p>"Quite certain, Mother." Grace was airily sure of herself.</p>
<p>"But Grace, . . . you're thirty . . . even if you don't look
it."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm thirty, Mother. And thank you for the implied
compliment."</p>
<p>"Of course . . . if you don't love him. . . . But he is such a
<i>nice</i> man . . . and your being thirty. . . ." Abbie's voice
trailed off uncertainly.</p>
<p>Grace laughed. "Can't you conceive of a woman being happy,
Mother, without a man at her heels?"</p>
<p>"But, Grace, it's so natural, . . . so . . . normal."</p>
<p>"Well, that sort of thing doesn't appeal to <i>me</i>."</p>
<p>"'That sort of thing!' Why, Grace, it's the finest thing in
the world when it's the right man."</p>
<p>Grace was impatient. "See here, Mother, I have my life all
mapped out, and a man doesn't figure in it. I want to be free and
independent. I want to do more research work in the East. And I'm
perfectly satisfied with my lot. I have at present one hundred
and twenty students in my classes, a large number of whom are
fitting themselves to be teachers. If two-thirds of them go out
to teach, that will be eighty new instructors. They, in time,
will teach an average of forty students each and the result is, I
have directly and indirectly influenced three thousand two
hundred students."</p>
<p>"Goodness sakes, Grace," Abbie said in exasperation, "you
sound like government statistics."</p>
<p>And so Grace was not to be married and the pearls would still
lie in the velvet box waiting for a Mackenzie bride.</p>
<p>But if there were no romance in the world for Grace, the
little winged god was not without its victims in the Deal clan,
for Stanley Deal and Dr. Fred Baker, Jr., were both married the
same year, Stanley to an Omaha girl,--"popular in the younger
set," as the papers unanimously agreed, and young Dr. Fred to a
red-headed nurse with whom he had worked during the days in camp
before going overseas.</p>
<p>The year that John was elected to the legislature, Mack was
made a vice-president of his bank. John was forty-eight, tall,
straight, his black hair showing two silver patches above the
ear, his whole physique always reminding Abbie of his father.</p>
<p>Mack was fifty-three, and a bird's-eye view of him standing
east and west, if the spectator chanced to be looking north,
would resemble nothing in the world so much as one of the portly
pigeons around his mother's old hay loft. He wore horn-rimmed
glasses, went in for golf and Rotary and the Commercial Club,
freely paid his church and associated charity subscriptions,
thought a great deal of his first wife, who was also his last,
and altogether was so decent and clean and so respected in the
rather nervous business world, that he would have made an ideal
target for the shots of any of the most weightily important and
wordily devastating of the critics of our social structure.</p>
<p>Abbie took Lincoln, Omaha and Chicago papers, and with the
same scissors that had cut out their homemade clothes, carefully
cut out every item concerning her now rather well-known children.
Sometimes she would run across one which gave her a few moments
of almost wicked glee. One such was:</p>
<p>"Perhaps more through the influence of Mackenzie Deal than any
other single person, this series of Shakespearean plays is being
brought to Omaha, . . ."</p>
<p>For a few moments Abbie saw, in retrospect, a freckle-faced
boy in a sod-house, hunching over a thick volume of plays and
saying, "Aw, what's the sense in this?"</p>
<p>"Dear, dear," she said to herself, "'There <i>is</i> a
divinity which shapes our ends, rough hew them how we will.'"</p>
<p>After a year, Dr. Fred Baker, Jr., and his wife were parents
of a sturdy son. Dr. Fred, Sr., and Margaret were grandparents.
Abbie was a great-grandmother. Where had the time gone? Blown by
the winds she could not stop,--ticked off by the clock hands she
could not stay.</p>
<p>Tourists were flocking back now into war-torn Europe and one
spring Grace began making plans to go abroad in the summer. She
was thirty-three now. "Only four years younger than my mother was
when we made the journey from Illinois," Abbie thought. "And
Mother looked old enough to be her mother, if not her
grandmother." What was the secret of it, she wondered.</p>
<p>One Friday night with the April buds bursting into pink froth
on the peach trees, and the April moon caught in the top of a
Lombardy poplar, Grace arrived home unexpectedly.</p>
<p>"Well . . . well . . . it's my baby." Abbie was as delighted
as she was surprised. Life was full of nice things.</p>
<p>Grace, too, was happy to see her mother. "And why do you think
I came?" She was sparkling, vivacious.</p>
<p>"You've got a beau," Abbie guessed right away. "You're not . .
. oh, Grace, . . . you're not going to be married?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother." Grace laughed light-heartedly. "You're
incorrigibly romantic, aren't you? Heavens, no! How you would
enjoy tying me down for life. No . . . it's something about
you."</p>
<p>"About me?"</p>
<p>"Yes." She seemed fairly exuding mystery and excitement.</p>
<p>"I never could guess, Grace."</p>
<p>"You're going abroad with me."</p>
<p>"Oh, no." Abbie was incredulous. "I don't think I could,
Grace. You don't think I could, do you?"</p>
<p>"I certainly do. You know, Mother, I got to thinking about it
in school and you are going, too. We'll take it very slowly.
You're pretty well, you know, for a woman of your age. It just
came to me as suddenly as a flash, . . . why couldn't Mother go,
too? I didn't write it because I was too anxious to talk it over
with you. You will have to decide right away on account of
reservations."</p>
<p>"My! My! Grace." Abbie could not quite face the reality of the
plan.</p>
<p>"Listen, Mother. How would you like to see the 'green coast of
Ireland'?"</p>
<p>"My! . . . My! . . ." In moments of great emotion Abbie's
words were few.</p>
<p>"And London Tower?"</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, to Abbie Deal, from somewhere out of the past
there came a haunting melody. Its lilting notes wove in and out
of the magical things Grace was saying. She could not quite catch
its refrain, and the words, too, evaded her. In and out of her
mind it danced with elfish glee, a little half-memory. Something
about "having gold and having land."</p>
<p>"And go to Scotland and look up the old Mackenzie estate?"</p>
<p>"My! . . . My! . . ." That old refrain,--what was it? It
seemed to come to her out of the night.</p>
<p>"And Stratford-on-Avon with Ann Hathaway's cottage? . . ."</p>
<p>"My! . . . My! . . ." Little half-memory, singing
tantalizingly near her,--something that was "dreaming visions
longingly." It flickered ahead of her, a will-o'-the-wisp from
out of the past, beckoning her to come and do this thing. She
could not place it, could not catch it. Whether song or poem,
story or scene, she was not sure. She only knew it was something
that was mostly joyous, but a little sad.</p>
<p>Bewildered, incredulous, undecided, she went to bed. "Will,
what do you think?"</p>
<p><i>I think it would be fine.</i></p>
<p>All night she turned and tossed with the excitement and the
responsibility of the decision. Once she got up and rubbed
liniment on her knees. Toward morning she slept, but
fitfully.</p>
<p>When she made her kitchen fire and cooked breakfast, all the
high enthusiasm of the evening before had vanished. She hated to
meet Grace and break the news, dreaded to see the eager interest
fade from her face.</p>
<p>As soon as Grace came down the old enclosed stairway, Abbie
told her. "Grace, I can't go."</p>
<p>"Why, Mother! I thought last night you would."</p>
<p>"No, I can't, Grace. But you don't know how I appreciate your
thinking of it, and wanting me. Don't I realize how much easier
it would be for you to get around without me? Well, that makes me
appreciate it all the more. It's one of the nicest, if not the
very nicest thing you ever did for me,--to come home to talk it
over. But I can't go."</p>
<p>"I think you're making a mistake, Mother. I'm quite sure you
could get through the trip all right."</p>
<p>"No, Grace. I'm more disappointed than you can ever realize.
I'm so disappointed that I almost wish you hadn't put it into my
head. Isn't that childish? Last night I couldn't sleep for
thinking about it. I was that excited . . . but when I woke up
this morning from a little nap I had, I knew I couldn't go. I
have pains in my knees sometimes until the tears come. And my
spells of asthma are coming a little closer. I'm tied to a whole
row of little bottles on the top pantry shelf. You wouldn't want
me to have a spell of asthma in front of the Louvre or have to
sit down on the Bridge of Sighs because I was all out of breath.
It wouldn't be appropriate somehow. All the time my heart tells
me to go, my mind says not. Desire says one thing and good sense
another."</p>
<p>"I thought you would love it so."</p>
<p>"Oh, Grace, I would . . . when I was younger, <i>how</i> I
would! Things just don't connect sometimes. When I was young I
had no means or time, and now I have the means and time, I have
no youth."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't want to be responsible about urging you against
your judgment, of course. But I'm certainly sorry. I said to
myself, 'I'll get half of my enjoyment from seeing Mother's
enthusiasm.'"</p>
<p>"Thank you, dearie, for the thought, but I'll stay home and
read about the trip. You write me from all the places you stop.
And I'll just stay in my chair and travel with you. And if
<i>anybody</i> could take a trip that way I know I can, for I've
always thrilled over reading travels."</p>
<p>Grace was loath to accept the decision. "As I said, I'm sorry.
You owe it to yourself, if you possibly can go. Your life has
been so narrow, Mother . . . just here, all the time. You ought
to get out now and see things."</p>
<p>Unwittingly, as so often she did, Grace had hurt her Mother's
feelings. For a moment Abbie nursed her little hurt, and then she
said quietly, "You know, Grace, it's queer, but I don't
<i>feel</i> narrow. I <i>feel</i> broad. How can I explain it to
you, so you would understand? I've seen everything . . . and I've
hardly been away from this yard. I've seen cathedrals in the snow
on the Lombardy poplars. I've seen the sun set behind the Alps
over there when the clouds have been piled up on the edge of the
prairie. I've seen the ocean billows in the rise and the fall of
the prairie grass. I've seen history in the making . . . three
ugly wars flare up and die down. I've sent a lover and two
brothers to one, a son and son-in-law to another, and two
grandsons to the other. I've seen the feeble beginnings of a raw
state and the civilization that developed there, and I've been
part of the beginning and part of the growth. I've married . . .
and borne children and looked into the face of death. Is
childbirth narrow, Grace? Or marriage? Or death? When you've
experienced all those things, Grace, the spirit has traveled
although the body has been confined. I think travel is a rare
privilege and I'm glad you can have it. But not every one who
stays at home is narrow and not every one who travels is broad. I
think if you can understand humanity . . . can sympathize with
every creature . . . can put yourself into the personality of
every one . . . you're not narrow . . . you're broad."</p>
<p>Rather strangely, Grace was neither antagonistic nor
argumentative. "You know, Mother . . . there's something to that
thought. And another thing, Mother,--do you know, there's
something about you at times that is sort of majestic and
poetical. I believe if you had ever done anything with it, you
might have written."</p>
<p>"No, . . ." Abbie Deal said wistfully, "no . . . I was only
meant to appreciate it,--not do it."</p>
<p>At the close of the day Abbie went contentedly to bed. Her
head was heavy. Her limbs ached. It seemed a little hard to
breathe. But a warm feeling of comfort was upon her that she was
to stay in the quiet backwater of her own home.</p>
<p>"I'm not going, Will."</p>
<p><i>That's too bad, Abbie. It would have been
wonderful.</i></p>
<p>"I know it would have, Will. But you understand how it
is."</p>
<p><i>I understand, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p>"I knew you would. Whenever I tell you things, Will, I always
know you'll understand."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c29" id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>At seventy-eight, Abbie had shriveled as the hazel-nuts near
the old Iowa schoolhouse shrivel when the frost comes on. Her
O'Conner body was shaped like her mother's had been,--a
pudding-bag tied in the middle. Her shoulders were rounded. Her
hair was drawn back into a small white knot at the nape of her
neck. The girls were always trying to fix her up. They brought
her dresses and shoes and gloves. But the feet that had carried
her through nearly eight decades of activities had not kept their
neat shape. The long Mackenzie fingers were as gnarled as they
were tapered. Two of them twisted together grotesquely.</p>
<p>"Let me be," she said. "You can't make me over now . . . it's
too late. I'll just keep on using plenty of soap and water. I
like to see you girls look so nice. But there are too many things
to do, to fuss with myself so much."</p>
<p>That summer the old settlers held a big picnic down on the
Chautauqua grounds near Stove Creek. It was a gala occasion.
Youth must be served,--but not on the day of an old settlers'
reunion. Every one knew every one else. On all sides one heard
the same type of comment: "Well . . . well . . . if it ain't
Mamie Balderman. I'd never have known you. Heavier, ain't
you?"</p>
<p>"That's Anne Jorden. I declare I believe she's carrying the
same brown parasol."</p>
<p>"Yes, that parasol's as old as the schoolhouse."</p>
<p>"Your daughter, Lizzie? No . . . not <i>grand</i>daughter . .
. you don't mean it? Why, it seems only a few years ago I was at
your wedding."</p>
<p>Most of the old folks, who were there, had come into the
country as young married people. Some of them were bent and
gnarled and weather-beaten. Others looked sturdy and clear-eyed.
Many of the babies who had been wrapped in old shawls in covered
wagons or born later in the soddies were there,--now farmers and
attorneys, doctors, preachers and bankers. By some peculiar
thrust of Fate, that wag who plays jokes on us all, it seemed
that those who had been poorest in the early days, were now the
wealthiest,--those who had been of least importance, now the most
prominent. Some call it the law of compensation,--others, luck.
It is, of course, neither one.</p>
<p>Standing about in twos or knots, they were all talking in
reminiscent mood. One heard snatches of life stories on all
sides,--a whole drama in every detached phrase:</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, when I got into Omaha, . . . I had ten cents. Two
men had just been drowned in the old Missouri, and I made the
coffins, . . . got ten dollars for them."</p>
<p>"When the Mormon train went by, women and children were
pulling carts. A child was crying . . . its foot painin' from a
loose laced shoe. Ma said she used to have a kind of nightmare
afterwards . . . 'n' in her sleep she would always be tryin' to
find that child cryin' . . . in a long train of ox-carts that
kept goin' by 'n' goin' by."</p>
<p>"Shucks, we made <i>our</i> syrup by boilin' down watermelon
juice. . . . <i>Sure,</i> it took an awful lot!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Zim's gone. He and Aunt Mandy used to say if they
ever saved a thousand dollars, they'd take it and get back East
as fast as they could go. Finally they made it, but thought it
would be lots nicer to have two thousand, so they saved and
accumulated and then set the amount to four thousand. Never went
back at all. Died four years ago, a few months apart. Left
several large farms and bank stock besides ten thousand dollars
to each of their seven grandchildren."</p>
<p>All of the groups were not of a peaceful character. Some were
having heated arguments over the trivial details of episodes a
half century forgotten.</p>
<p>"No . . . you're wrong, Sam, . . . it was eighteen
seventy-one."</p>
<p>"No, . . . Joe, 'seventy-two. I remember because it was the
year the pie-plant froze."</p>
<p>Or, "I remember you coming just as well that day because I saw
your wagons . . ."</p>
<p>"I don't know why you say 'wagons,' Celia. There was no plural
number, when all we had was a bed and two chairs and a bob-tailed
cow."</p>
<p>And then it was time for the speech of the day. The young
county attorney made it, from the airy heights of the band stand,
at his side a glass of water on Abbie Deal's marble-topped
table.</p>
<p>It was a good speech. It flapped its wings and soared over the
oaks and elms, and eventually came home to roost with: "You . . .
<i>you</i> were the intrepid people! You, my friends, were the
sturdy ones. Your days have been magnificent poems of labor. Your
years have been as heroic stories as the sagas. Your lives have
been dauntless, courageous, sweeping epics."</p>
<p>"'Sweeping' is the word, Sarah!" Abbie said when the applause
had faded away into the grove. "I wish I had a dollar for every
broom I've worn out."</p>
<p>Sarah Lutz's little black eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>"How about it, Abbie, do you feel like a poem?"</p>
<p>"No, Sarah, I was always too busy filling up the youngsters
and getting the patches on the overalls to notice that I was part
of an epic."</p>
<p>It was after the speech that Abbie first saw Oscar Lutz, who,
at eighty-four, a little bent but as hardy as any old hickory,
had come from California to be present at the reunion. Of the
four old neighbors, Will Deal, Henry and Oscar Lutz and Gus
Reinmueller, Oscar was now the only one living. He was well-to-do
with his bonds and mortgages, his land and his California
home.</p>
<p>"How are you, Oscar?"</p>
<p>"How are you, Abbie? It's mighty nice to be back . . . mighty
nice."</p>
<p>"We're glad to have you, Oscar . . ."</p>
<p>"Went down to Plattsmouth yestidy and found the post where the
boats tied up fifty-eight years ago."</p>
<p>"My! My! Oscar! Is the post still there?"</p>
<p>"Still there, Abbie. Gettin' old like us . . . a little rotten
. . . but still there . . . and a good mile and a quarter away
from water. River bed's changed that much."</p>
<p>"I can scarcely believe it."</p>
<p>"Everything changes, Abbie . . . folks and rivers. I kicked
the old post when I found it."</p>
<p>"What for, Oscar?"</p>
<p>"Don't know, exactly, Abbie. Kind of a ceremony, I guess." He
had a far-away look in his eyes. "Remember how I told you I
kicked it when Henry and I was waitin' for the boat to come
bringin' Martha 'n' Sarah 'n' Grandpa?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember, Oscar, . . . you said you was so impatient
waitin' for Martha you had to take it out on some thing."</p>
<p>"Well. . . ." He was silent so long that Abbie thought he had
finished with the subject. ". . . Martha's been gone twenty-two
years . . ." The old man fussed with his watch. "Twenty-two
years! Went down to Plattsmouth yestidy 'n' kicked the post again
. . . like I was waitin' for somethin' . . . a boat to come in .
. . or somethin'. . . . Foolish, wasn't it? Kind of a ceremony, I
guess."</p>
<p>After the old settlers' reunion, Abbie spent a few days with
Margaret Baker in Lincoln. John Deal took his mother up in the
big sedan. On the same road that Abbie had driven her team over
thirty years before, stopping at Stevens Creek to eat her lunch,
John took his mother now over the hard packed gravel in forty
minutes. He growled a good deal at the county commissioners over
a mile stretch in which he had to slow down a little.</p>
<p>The Bakers had one of the lovely new homes of the city,
artistic in every point, from the dwarf evergreens in front to
the Russian olives in the rear of the garden. Margaret had
overseen every detail to the last door knob. Dr. Baker was a
specialist now. <i>"Which</i> side of the heart is your
particular line?" Abbie asked him in mock seriousness. "Dear,
dear, you doctors have got our anatomy so divided up and
pigeon-holed that nobody knows where to go if he just happens to
feel bad all over. You're not as smart as our old Dr. Hornby.
When he first came to Nebraska, he practiced medicine and
surgery, fitted glasses and pulled teeth, was a notary public and
sold sewing-machines."</p>
<p>Margaret Deal Baker was fifty-four now, gray-haired,
calm-eyed, level-headed, one of the substantial women of the
city, her name a part of every artistic and civic endeavor.
"'Poise' is Aunt Margaret's middle name," Katherine Deal, who was
sixteen and given to expressing herself freely, would say.
Democratic to the finger-tips, Margaret Baker, with her lovely
home and her prominent position, refused to forget her humble
beginnings. "When I was a girl . . ." she would say, and go off
into a hearty peal of laughter over the memory of some funny
episode out on the prairie when the state was new.</p>
<p>"Yes, I go to the beauty parlor every week," she would say
frankly to a group of well-groomed women. "I have a shampoo and
hot-oil massage and wave. And when I was a girl, I was thankful
to wash my hair myself once in a while with water from a
rain-barrel with drowned gnats in it."</p>
<p>Grace, lacking humor, was sometimes disturbed by her sister's
attitude. "There's no use <i>parading</i> the fact that you once
lived on beans and cornmeal," she would say.</p>
<p>"But plenty of use in parading the fact that it was your
ancestor who hung the light in old North tower," Margaret would
get back, with her mother's twinkle in her gray eyes. The
Revolutionary ancestors on her father's side were a source of
great pride and solace to Grace Deal.</p>
<p>"At least Aunt Grace believes in the D.A.R. part of the Darwin
theory," was another of Katherine Deal's airy quips.</p>
<p>On this visit of Abbie's to Margaret, she found the latter
just finishing a canvas with final loving touches.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Mother?" Margaret, in her studio smock,
stood back to watch her mother's face.</p>
<p>Abbie came a step nearer to get the best vision. For some time
she stood and looked at the unframed scene standing on the easel.
When she turned, her wrinkled face was aglow. "You've got it,
Margaret. It's there at last, . . . the light lying in little
pools on the prairie. You've caught it . . . just as you said you
wanted to."</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe I've caught it. But think, Mother, I've been
trying for thirty years to get it as I wanted it. What was the
matter with me before?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, dear. I guess it's always that way. There's no
short-cut to anything. The Master demands full time of us before
we are paid."</p>
<p>For some reason little Laura Deal continued to be Abbie's
favorite grandchild. The little girl answered Abbie's deep love
for her with an affection equally sincere,--or perhaps, it was
the other way. Perhaps the fact that Laura held such admiration
for her grandmother enkindled its answer in Abbie's heart. From
the time Laura was five she had brought her grandmother little
stories of her own composition. Abbie had them all in safe
keeping, just as she had everything else which had ever come into
her possession.</p>
<p>One of the first of these literary achievements, laboriously
printed, was:</p>
<p>"A man once on a time had a poket-buk ful of munny he lost the
munny and too this day he has to worck."</p>
<p>"Laura has the right idea," Abbie told the relatives in high
glee. "She has the whole philosophy of life summed up in a short
story. She'll be a writer some day."</p>
<p>At eight, she had brought her grandmother more lengthy
compositions, running largely to an atmosphere of delectable
foods, and over which the whole clan surreptitiously laughed:
"'Oh, no,' said the young lady, as she nibbled daintily at a
piece of chocolate pie with whipped cream on it and a cherry on
top of that and a nut on top of that."</p>
<p>At eleven, Laura had discovered what romance meant, and her
writing leaned conspicuously toward that direction. Abbie was
sitting on a bench under the cedars on a mild spring afternoon
when Laura came out of the house bearing the inevitable pencil
and notebook.</p>
<p>"Listen here, Grandma. Here's my new one. It's called 'My
Dream of Imagination.':</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"I was once a princess, a captive in castle
grim<br>
And a dragon wanted to drag me to come and live with him.<br>
<br>
Now I had violet eyes and long yellow gleaming hair<br>
And people said I was beautiful with my pure white skin so
fair."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Abbie listened with undiminished interest to the twenty-six
verses of dramatic, not to say gory, suspense, through:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"'Twas a terrible sight to see prince after prince
fall dead<br>
But the dragon only laughed with glee and said he'd have me to
wed,"</i>
<p><i> </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the happy ending of:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"I gazed out of my turret,--it was my wedding
day<br>
When suddenly I saw some one riding who was not far away<br>
<br>
I watched the shine of his armour glitter in the sun's bright
ray<br>
<br>
Then nimbly and quickly I saw him dismount. He had stopped to
pray.<br>
<br>
Then slowly arising I saw him make the sign of the cross<br>
While grasping his sword in his right hand, he mounted upon his
hoss.</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>"You know, Grandma, that worries me, to have to say 'hoss.' It
isn't just right but neither is 'horse' with 'cross'."</p>
<p>And so they discussed it seriously, Abbie who knew that one
may laugh <i>with</i> a child but not <i>at</i> him, and Laura,
who knew that Grandma was one unfailing source of sympathy and
understanding in a world which was beginning to be critical.</p>
<p>"Now, tell me about when you were young, Grandma . . . some of
the things you've never told me."</p>
<p>"Well, there is something I never told one of my children . .
. but now I'll tell it to you. Before I married your grandfather,
another young man wanted to marry me. He was quite the catch of
the community."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you, Grandma . . . why didn't you marry him?"</p>
<p>"I had a very pretty voice and he wanted me to marry him and
go to New York to study music while he took some medical work. I
was anxious to cultivate my voice and the whole thing was a very
wonderful opportunity for me so I very nearly married the young
man. But something happened that made me realize it was just the
thought of the New York opportunity that was influencing my
decision, rather than love for the young man himself."</p>
<p>"What happened, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"I saw Will Deal coming down the lane."</p>
<p>"Just coming down the lane, Grandma? Was that all?"</p>
<p>"Just coming down the lane."</p>
<p>"What became of the young man, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"He became a big New York surgeon . . . so . . . if I had
married him . . . my life would have been very different. I guess
women have done that from time immemorial. A young man walks down
a lane . . . and a whole life changes."</p>
<p>"And you had to tell the other young man you wouldn't marry
him, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"Yes, . . . I told him."</p>
<p>"Was he sad?"</p>
<p>"A little sad . . . and a little angry . . . and terribly
surprised."</p>
<p>"Why was he so surprised, Grandma?"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal smiled reminiscently. "I think it had never
occurred to him that any girl would refuse him."</p>
<p>"And what did he say?"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal pondered a moment. "That I cannot tell you."</p>
<p>"Because it was too romantic, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"No . . ." said Abbie Deal. And by this, quite suddenly she
knew that she was an old woman. "No . . . because I have
forgotten."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c30" id="c30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>You will remember that Basil Mackenzie, an aristocratic young
Scotchman, of Aberdeen, riding to the hares and hounds, wooed and
won Maggie O'Conner from the whins and silver hazels of
Ballyporeen. But what you do not know is that several generations
later, the good Saints, up in high heaven's court, gave that
couple three chances each to mold the life of a descendant . . .
a baby girl . . . just born upon earth. Basil Mackenzie first
crowned her with hair like the mist around the mountains of
Glencoe when the sun shines through,--and immediately Maggie
O'Conner gave her eyes the color of the blue-black waters at
Kilkee. Then the man, remembering sensibly that the outward
appearance is not all, endowed her with a keen Scotch mind,--but
the woman smiled and slipped an Irish heart into her. For a long
time Basil pondered cannily, wondering how he might use his last
chance and finally gave her the sturdiest of Scotch chins,--but
Maggie O'Conner laughed and pressed a roguish V-shaped cleft into
the center of it.</p>
<p>Practical folks there are, who will not believe this; but
here, nineteen years later, was Katherine Deal with her misty
Glencoe hair and her blue-black Kilkenny eyes and her gay
great-granny's dimple in the middle of her daur
great-grandfaither's chin. Sure, and what more proof could a-body
be needin'? Here she was,--Katherine, the only daughter of
Mackenzie Deal,--this warm summer afternoon, stretched out in her
Grandmother Deal's hammock on the screened-in sitting-room porch
of the farmhouse, her slim lithe body in its blue and white sport
suit curved comfortably in the hammock's old meshes, one slim
silken foot rhythmically tapping the floor.</p>
<p>"As free and irresponsible as any colt in a pasture," old
Abbie Deal thought, as she look out at her granddaughter, "and
just about as untamed too."</p>
<p>Across the lane road, under the Lombardys, Abbie could see the
latest model of sport roadster, blue and white, a special order
of Mack's. Whether Katherine's dress had been ordered to match
the car, or the car to match the dress, Abbie did not know.</p>
<p>Old Abbie Deal and her granddaughter did not have a great many
interests in common. They did not seem able to get along
comfortably for any length of time. Katherine had not the
slightest atom of her cousin Laura's interest in either the
grandmother's opinions or reminiscences. With her usual blunt
frankness, she had more than once announced before a group of the
relatives, including the object of her remarks: "Granny Deal. . .
." (Incidentally, she was the only one of the seven grandchildren
who called her "Granny.") "Granny Deal and I don't hit it off any
too well." She said it with the air of one who modestly announces
an accomplishment.</p>
<p>But for some reason, she had driven in alone from Omaha
several times recently. The dashing new roadster had bitten off
the graveled miles between Omaha and Cedartown frequently this
summer of Abbie Deal's seventy-ninth year. Rather strangely, for
her usual active self, the girl seemed to like to sit quietly
under the cedars or swing idly in the hammock on the screen
porch. This afternoon she had a book into which she occasionally
dived, and as often dropped back in her lap.</p>
<p>Abbie pulled her chintz-covered rocker up closer to the screen
door.</p>
<p>"What are you reading, Kathie?" she called.</p>
<p>"Michael Arlen . . . nothing but. He's delicious. Everything
he says sounds silky. Listen to this, Granny:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'. . . <i>love is like a hammer</i> . . .'</p>
<p><i>'Oh, not a hammer!'</i></p>
<p><i>'A hammer, darling. It beats and beats inside him and
presently it doesn't beat so regularly, and presently it doesn't
beat at all. . . .'</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Doesn't that just melt in your mouth?"</p>
<p>"The words are very clever. But not all clever words are
true."</p>
<p>"You said a bookful, Granny. And inversely most things that
are true are not clever."</p>
<p>She seemed to have everything, thought old Abbie Deal,
studying her attractive granddaughter. She had the Irish wit of
the O'Conners, the Scotch canniness of the Mackenzies, the German
self-interest of the Lutzes, the Yankee determination of the
Deals. She carried everything before her. People did whatever she
wished. She breezed in and out of every setting with
self-assurance. She dominated every situation with poise. She
told her parents what she thought of them and handed out
indiscriminate advice to any of her relatives. And through it all
she looked as lovely as a picture.</p>
<p>And now, Abbie, thinking of what the girl had just read, to
her, returned thoughtfully, "You can't describe love, Kathie and
you can't define it. Only it goes with you all your life. I think
that love is more like a light that you carry. At first childish
happiness keeps it lighted and after that romance. Then
motherhood lights it and then duty . . . and maybe after that
sorrow. You wouldn't think that sorrow could be a light would
you, dearie? But it can. And then after that, service lights it.
Yes. . . . I think that is what love is to a woman . . . a
lantern in her hand."</p>
<p>"Prosaic. . . . Granny, prosaic and uninteresting, albeit the
romance chapter has possibilities. I choose to think of Mike's
variety that 'beats and beats.' It's more thrilling."</p>
<p>"You'll see, Kathie, when it comes."</p>
<p>"Heavens,--the little grandmother speaks in the future
tense,--and to me, Katherine Elaine Deal, wot has had several
distinct and separate love affairs."</p>
<p>"Oh, Kathie, how can you speak so? . . . I doubt if one of
those 'affairs,' as you call them, was love."</p>
<p>"Oh, but they <i>were, cher ami</i> . . . or <i>cher amie</i>
. . . whichever you are. They were deep, thrilling, luscious love
affairs while they lasted. <i>While</i> they lasted . . . !" She
went off into a little rippling laugh.</p>
<p>Abbie Deal did not argue. She did not answer. She only sat and
looked out at her granddaughter, flippant, sophisticated, wise,
irresponsible, lovely. Because she had a deep-rooted clannish
love for all her own people, Abbie Deal loved the girl,--but she
did not understand her. They lived in two worlds. No, Granny Deal
and Katherine did not hit it off any too well.</p>
<p>It was only a week later that Sarah Lutz came out to spend a
few days with Abbie. Her seventy-seven years sat lightly upon
Sarah. Her white hair, dressed rather elaborately, held a gayly
colored, green jeweled comb in its coils and she had little
emerald earrings in her small colorless ears. The natural pink in
her cheeks of the early days had been replaced by natural pink
from a box, and her small merry eyes behind their shell-rimmed
glasses were still bright and twinkling. Her dress was of modern
cut, and her dainty high-heeled slippers, by the side of Abbie's
broad and altogether serviceable kids, looked, as they walked
through the yard, like gay little yachts towing broad barges into
harbor.</p>
<p>The two had just reached the sitting-room when they both
jumped at the sharp sound of an auto-horn and looked out to see
Katherine in the brilliant roadster turning into the lane road
under the Lombardys.</p>
<p>"Honk . . . honk . . . the lark at heaven's gate sings," she
called out breezily and slipped out of the car to run up to the
house, her lithe young body aglow with health and energy.</p>
<p>"No?" she said in mock agitation at the sight of both
grandmothers. "Not <i>two</i> old noble ancestors?" Katherine's
reverence for old age was on a precise equality with her general
timidity.</p>
<p>She gave them each a hasty peck and took immediate possession
of the conversation. "I haven't seen very much of you lately,
Sarah. But Abbie, here, . . . I have been cultivating her
acquaintance this summer with malice. And the queer part,
Sarah,--is that the little old dear doesn't have the slightest
idea why I have been dropping in so solicitously."</p>
<p>Sarah laughed good naturedly, and Abbie asked, "Then it wasn't
just because you wanted to see me, Kathie?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," she admitted blithely, "it's all on account of
Jimmie."</p>
<p>"Jimmie?"</p>
<p>"Jimmie Buchanan."</p>
<p>"Oh, . . ." Abbie remembered. "The young man in John's law
office."</p>
<p>"'The very same,' quoth the maiden, 'as a tear stood in her
eye.' I've had a crush on him ever since I first saw him striding
along with his little old textbooks across the campus. But I
never dated him then. I suppose you can guess why?"</p>
<p>"No." Abbie Deal and Sarah Lutz gave up immediately, for the
answers to Katherine's conundrums were usually as unique as they
were varied.</p>
<p>"Because," Katherine said, mysteriously, "he was a barb."</p>
<p>"No," said Abbie. "Not that bad?" Abbie might not be
conversant with half of Katherine's modern vernacular, but she
did know that a barb was a non-fraternity man.</p>
<p>"Now . . . Granny . . . you're turning on the sarcasm. Don't
you make merry with me. Yes, my loves, a barb, . . . <i>never</i>
went into a frat." It was as though she spoke of Lucifer's fall
or Napoleon's exile. "He probably washed his own shirts on
Saturdays and ate at hamburger joints . . . and here I'm crazy
about him. But he won't have me. I've done everything but fling
myself on the cement walk in front of Uncle John's office and
yell until he comes out and picks me up. Mother is getting a
little discouraged about marrying me to the Prince of Wales. But
she is still counting on some one of the Vanderastors . . . and
here I am just foolish about Jimmie Buchanan and ready to throw
myself at his re-soled Oxfords. He'll be Governor some day or
Secretary of the Exterior. But in the meantime, he'll marry some
neat little Jane that'll economize and have twins . . ."</p>
<p>"Kathie!" It was both grandmothers, simultaneously.</p>
<p>"Oh . . . very well . . . one at a time if you prefer," she
went on unblushingly.</p>
<p>"He's a nice boy," Abbie Deal broke in to avert other verbal
catastrophes. "John speaks so highly of him. I'll invite him out
some night to supper when you're here."</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't bother. I have already. It's tonight." She
smiled at them cheerfully. "I'm going in to get him at six.
You'll fix a nice little dinner, won't you, Granny?"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal sat down weakly. Flesh of her flesh was saying
that. Blood of her blood was taking the initiative in a love
affair. "Oh, Kathie . . . girls are so queer now-days. They do
such <i>forward</i> things. It would have been nicer for me
to."</p>
<p>"Girls now-days," said Miss Deal, "do things immediately . . .
right off the bat . . . snap . . . just like that."</p>
<p>"So I see," said Abbie Deal dryly.</p>
<p>"Now, here's the idea," Kathie went on, unperturbed. "You two
old baby-dolls get up a nice little dinner while I go after
Jimmie. Then I'll come home with him and put on a fetching pink
apron and set the table and bring in the provender . . . and
Jimmie will begin to think <i>I'm</i> the neat little Jane." She
smiled at them with gay nonchalance. She patted them both. She
kissed them each a time or two. And they gave in.</p>
<p>"She's yours, Sarah, as much as she's mine," Abbie said, when
they were starting the meal, "and I, for one, am ashamed of
her."</p>
<p>"Oh, . . . she's all right, Abbie. She's just outspoken."</p>
<p>"At nineteen, Sarah, I was married, and had Katherine's
father, and had washed and ironed and sewed and made soap and
woven rag carpet . . . and . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes . . . but, Abbie, you just couldn't do anything else. I
can think of a dozen things that Kathie could do right now if she
set her mind to it."</p>
<p>They prepared the dinner . . . the two old belles of another
generation.</p>
<p>A little after six, Katherine dashed into the lane road at a
speed which jangled the nerves of a flock of stolid Plymouth Rock
hens, and set the brakes a few inches from a gander that stuck
out his neck and expressed disapproval of the blue and white
monstrosity.</p>
<p>"Honk honk, yourself," Katherine called out to the offended
dignitary, and then came into the house with a nice-looking,
clean-cut young fellow. She came triumphantly. "Well . . . here's
Jimmie. It took handcuffs and an anesthetic to get him but I did
the deed. Jimmie, you know Grandmother Deal, . . . but I want to
present you to Grandmother Lutz. Grandma . . . Jimmie Buchanan .
. . the conquered. Well," she waved an airy hand at the two old
ladies, "how do you like 'em, Jimmie? I could love either . . .
'were t'other dear charmer away.'"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal was embarrassed beyond measure. She was used to the
girl's wild talk before her own people, but she did not dream
Kathie would keep it up when the young man came. Abbie looked at
him. He was not disgusted. He was looking at Katherine with
approbation and liking . . . even admiration. He <i>liked</i> her
flippant talk. The young man, himself, <i>liked</i> it. Well, she
gave up. She washed her hands of the present generation. They
were away beyond her.</p>
<p>Katherine put on a rose-pink apron which she had brought with
evident forethought, and winked openly at her respective
progenitors as she carried in the food.</p>
<p>They ate the palatable if simple dinner together,--this rather
incongruous little group, after which Katherine said demurely,
"Now, Jimmie and I'll wash the dishes, won't we, Jimmie?" Which
was something of an astonishing innovation in itself, as,
heretofore, dish-washing had not been one of Katherine's favorite
indoor sports.</p>
<p>A half-hour later, Abbie and Sarah went into the kitchen, just
as Katherine was hanging up her dishpan. "Everything all right,
Granny?" she wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Why, I think so, Katherine. It looks very nice."</p>
<p>"Neat little Jane, am I not?" She grinned brazenly at Abbie
Deal, who immediately reddened for her.</p>
<p>"Well, Sarah," said Abbie when they were alone, "my mother
blushed and gave my father a rose by a well on the Scottish
moors. I cried on Will's shoulder in an old honey-locust lane.
Mack courted Emma after church and singing-school. And Kathie . .
. Kathie goes out and gets her man."</p>
<p>Sarah Lutz laughed. "After all, Abbie, there's something
honest about it and frank and aboveboard."</p>
<p>Abbie put the butter-crock back into the big white
refrigerator. "Sarah," she said, "it may be honest and it may be
frank and it may be aboveboard,--but it's not <i>subtle</i> and
it's not <i>romantic</i> and it's not <i>artistic."</i></p>
<p>Sarah Lutz's bright black eyes twinkled behind her
shell-rimmed glasses. "If you're not all wet, old lady," she said
solemnly, . . . <i>"you've said a mouthful."</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c31" id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Abbie made her usual extensive preparations for Christmas that
year. The daughters and daughters-in-law said a great deal
against her using up so much energy. "But you might as well talk
to the wind," Grace wrote to Isabelle. "There's something
stubborn about Mother. She is bound to go through with all that
mince-meat, doughnut, pop-corn-ball ordeal even if she's sick in
bed afterward. Margaret wants us to come there to save her all
that work, and Emma and Eloise have both offered their homes,
too, but she won't listen. 'No,' she says, 'as long as I'm here,
the Christmas gathering is here.' I've tried to tell her over and
over that conditions have changed, that we don't live out on an
isolated prairie any more; that she doesn't make one thing that
she couldn't buy, but she just won't catch up with the times.
'They're not so full of the Christmas spirit when you don't fix
them yourself,' she says. Isn't that the last word in
old-fashioned ideas?"</p>
<p>So the clan came once more to the old farmhouse behind the
cedars. Grace was the first to arrive in her own roadster, coming
over the graveled highway from Wesleyan University. The others
arrived at various times before Christmas eve. Mack and Emma,
Donald and Katherine came. Only Stanley was missing from the Mack
Deal family. Having married, Stanley had discovered that a wife's
people must also be reckoned with. Margaret and Dr. Fred Baker,
Dr. Fred, Jr., and his wife and two little boys came. Isabelle
and Harrison Rhodes got in from Chicago on the afternoon train,
the road boasting a flyer now instead of the old baggage-and-day
affair of the time when the children were small. John and Eloise,
Wentworth and Laura and Millard, who was eight now, all came over
from their home on the other side of Cedartown in time for the
evening meal. Every car was loaded to the doors with
packages.</p>
<p>Abbie had an oyster supper. That, too, was a hang-over from
the days when sea food was scarce and expensive. No matter that
the bi-valves were on every menu placed before the various
members of the Deal family these days, Abbie continued to have an
oyster supper each Christmas eve,--bowls of crackers alternating
down the long table with celery, standing upright in vase-looking
dishes, like so many bouquets from the greenhouse.</p>
<p>Jimmie Buchanan came over later in the evening and brought
Katherine a gift. Jimmie was rather astounded at the sight of so
many relatives.</p>
<p>"Every one has to be here," Katherine told him. "In all the
wedding ceremonies, whenever a Deal is married, the question is
asked, 'Do you solemnly promise to spend all your Christmases at
Granny Deal's, forsaking all others as long as you shall live?'
And if you can't promise,--out you go before you're in."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal was embarrassed beyond words. To speak so to a
young man with whom you were keeping company!</p>
<p>Katherine went on, "No, sir,--it wouldn't be Christmas without
the wax flowers in the parlor and the patent rocking-chair and
the painting of the purple cow and the <i>whut-nut.</i> Grandma
makes us all animal cookies yet. Can you beat it? When I was big
enough to read love stories by the dozens, she gave me 'The Frog
That Would A-Wooing Go,'--not but that it had its romantic
appeal, too. We always stay two nights and we have to have beds
everywhere. Granny puts us in corners, on couches, sinks,
bath-tubs, ironing-boards . . . and not one of us would miss it.
Donald passed up a dance at the Fontanelle for it. You can't tell
the reason, but the minute you see those old cedar trees and come
up the lane under the Bombarded poplars with snow on 'em, you're
just little and crazy over Christmas."</p>
<p>There were some very lovely presents the next morning,--the
radio in its dull-finished cabinet for Abbie, jewelry, a fur,
expensive toys and books,--an old musty smelling one for Emma,
who had gone in for first and rare editions. Margaret gave her
mother the painting of the prairie with the sunshine lying in
little yellow-pink pools between the low rolling hills. "For I
think you made me love it, Mother, when I was a little girl. I
learned to see it through your eyes," she told her.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mackenzie Deal, the Omaha banker, in an
overcoat and old muffler that had been his father's, spent a
large share of his time out in the barn cracking walnuts on a
cottonwood chunk. John Deal, the state legislator, went up into
the hay-loft and potted a few pigeons with an old half-rusty
rifle. Isabelle Deal Rhodes, the well-known Chicago singer,
called her husband to help her get the old reed-organ out of the
storehouse. She dusted it, and then, amid a great deal of
hilarity, pumped out, "By the Blue Alsatian Mountains." One of
the keys gave forth no sound at all, so that whenever she came to
it the young folks all shouted the missing note.</p>
<p>By evening the younger members of the group had gone,--Fred
Jr. and his family back to Lincoln, Donald and Wentworth to
Omaha, while Katherine was off somewhere with Jimmie Buchanan.
But the others, in the early dusk of the Christmas twilight,
gathered in the parlor with the homely coal-burner and the lovely
floor lamp, with Abbie's crude painting of the prairie and
Margaret's exquisite one, with the what-not and the blue plush
album and the tidy on the back of the patent-rocker.</p>
<p>"There was one Christmas we had, Mother," Mack said, "that I
always remember more than the others. I can see the things
yet,--my old brass cornet, a big wooden horse made out of logs, a
tree that looked . . . well, I've never seen a tree since look so
grand. Where in Sam Hill did you raise all the things in those
days?"</p>
<p>"I think I know which one you mean," Abbie was reminiscent.
"It was the year after the grasshoppers. Well, my son, your
father and I made all of those things out of sticks and rags and
patches and love."</p>
<p>It brought on a flood of reminiscences.</p>
<p>"Remember, Mack, the Sunday afternoon we were herding hogs on
the prairie and that Jake Smith that kept the store at Unadilla,
came along with his girl in a spring wagon, and threw a whole
handful of stick candy out in the grass for us?" Mrs. Frederick
Hamilton Baker, well-known artist and club woman of Lincoln, was
speaking.</p>
<p>"Do I? I can see them yet, red and white striped,--and looking
as big as barber-poles to me. I wondered how any one in the world
could be that rich and lavish," Mackenzie Deal, a vice-president
of one of the Omaha banks, was answering.</p>
<p>"And do you remember, John, how scared you were . . . the time
we chased the calf and you grabbed it by the tail when it ran by
you and the tail was frozen and came off in your hands?"</p>
<p>When they had all laughed at the recollection, Isabelle put
in, "But I'll bet he wasn't as scared as I was once, . . . the
time a man came to the door and told Father he was drawn on the
jury. You all stood around looking solemn, and I took a run for
Mother's old wardrobe and hid in behind the clothes and
cried."</p>
<p>"Why . . . what did you think?" They were all asking.</p>
<p>"Well, I knew 'jury' had something to do with law and jails
and penitentiaries. And I had heard of 'hung,' 'quartered' and
<i>'drawn'</i> so the inference was that Father was going to be
hung in the penitentiary."</p>
<p>"I remember once when I wasn't scared but <i>mad</i>." It was
Grace's contribution. "It was when Aunt Regina came to help
Mother take care of Grandma. I was modestly effacing myself under
the dining-room table and she scooped me out with a sprightly,
'So this is little Grace.' Then she took me on her lap and put
her arms around me and pressed me to her bosom and apparently
forgot me, while she and mother verbally married off and buried
all the relatives over my head."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you have the gumption to get down?"</p>
<p>"Too bashful, I suppose. That's where your ancient theories of
child training come in. No modern child would stand it. But I
just sat on while my legs went to sleep and my brain atrophied. I
used to think I sat there a month. But I know now it couldn't
have been more than a week."</p>
<p>"That's as bad as I was." It was John. "Remember that preacher
that used to stop at our house, the one with the beard that
looked as though it was made out of yellow rope?"</p>
<p>"Who could forget it? He tied it up like a horse's tail when
he ate." They were all answering at once.</p>
<p>"The first time he stopped, he said to Mack, 'What's your
name, son?' Mack said, 'Mackenzie.' 'And what's yours, little
man?' he said to me. I was so scared I said 'Mackenzie,' too. Can
you beat it? I'll bet there isn't a kid living to-day as bashful
as that."</p>
<p>"Do you remember," it was Isabelle, "the old milk-wagon, John,
you rigged up to peddle your milk in? I can smell the inside of
it yet, the damp, sweetish odor of warm milk. Remember how you
used to ring an old cow-bell and the women would come out with
their pans and pitchers, and have their aprons twisted up over
their heads? Think of the evil-looking germs that must have
perched on the rims of those pitchers when the dust swirled
around!"</p>
<p>And so they went on, recalling their childhood days,--days of
sunburn and days of chilblains, of made-over clothes and
corn-bread meals, of trudging behind plows or picking up
potatoes, of work that was interwoven with fun, because youth was
youth. Prairie children never forget.</p>
<p>Far into the evening they sat around the old coal burner,
talking and laughing, with tears not far behind the
laughter,--the state legislator and the banker, the artist, the
singer, and the college teacher. And in their midst, rocking and
smiling, sat the little old lady who had brought them up with a
song upon her lips and a lantern in her hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c32" id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Mackenzie Deals were leaving the morning after
Christmas.</p>
<p>"Can't you and Katherine stay longer?" Abbie asked Emma, a
little wistfully.</p>
<p>''No, Granny," Katherine assumed the responsibility for the
decision. "I've had a grand time, but now I must go, for I have a
date to-night,--and a blind one at that, . . . a Minnesota U.
man."</p>
<p>"'A blind date.' For goodness' sake, Katherine, what is
that?"</p>
<p>"Blind, Grandmother mine, means 'not seeing.' A date is a man
with whom to while away a boresome hour or two. There, you have
it . . . a man that you have never seen with whom to while away
an hour or two."</p>
<p>"Kathie . . . you mean you've never been introduced to
him?"</p>
<p>"Not only never introduced to him . . . but have never set
limpid violet eyes upon him."</p>
<p>"Kathie . . . how horrible! Why, it makes me think of veiled
people in heathenish countries."</p>
<p>"Quite so, and a merry little gamble it is. But see the thrill
of it! Is he going to be dark, light, short, tall, a keen looker,
or a crock . . . interesting or a prune? Will he glide up in a
high-powered machine or rattle up in an egg-beater?"</p>
<p>"Kathie!"</p>
<p>"If Jimmie were going to be there I wouldn't have made the
date. But Jimmie's not going to be there . . . and a poor girl
has to have somebody to love her."</p>
<p>"Kathie," Abbie looked at her granddaughter as at some queer
museum specimen, "do you know, you just make me wonder whatever
your great-great-grandmother would have thought of you. Isabelle
Anders-Mackenzie, her name was. She was gentle and refined,--very
lovely and very aristocratic. She lived on the beautiful
Mackenzie estates . . ."</p>
<p>"Stop . . . stop right there!" Katherine sat up, alert as a
young deer with uplifted head. "For heaven's sake, why has no one
ever told me that before? Why, our sorority is just <i>keen</i>
about family. That's our <i>line.</i> I've been sort of uncertain
about the past . . . a little shy in mentioning some of our
aunty-cedents and uncle-cedents . . . not ashamed of anybody,
y'unn'erstan', but just supposing they were all this same kind, .
. . out-of-the-soil-up-to-God."</p>
<p>"Kathie!"</p>
<p>"And all the time I had this keen ancestor. Now, say it again,
and very slowly . . . 'Katherine, your great-great-grandmother
was Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, a beautiful, aristocratic snob.
She <i>was</i> an awful snob, wasn't she, Granny?"</p>
<p>"Kathie!"</p>
<p>"Think how my marriage could read: 'The marriage of Miss
Katherine Elaine Deal to Mr. James Worden Buchanan . . .' I
haven't said anything about this yet to Jimmie, but as the
Chinaman says, 'Can happen,' and there's nothing like taking time
by the fetlock. Picture this in bold bad type in the Sunday
edition: 'Miss Deal is a direct descendant of the
Anders-Mackenzies of Aberdeen, Scotland, Knights of the Garters'
. . ."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal's old eyes twinkled. "But don't forget the other
side of the house, too, Kathie. There were knights of the
suspenders, too. Don't forget old Grandmother Bridget O'Conner,
Kathie. She was an Irish peasant woman and she lived in a shack
at the side of a hill on the edge of the moors. The chickens and
the pigs ran in and out of the thatch-covered hut. She couldn't
read a word and she couldn't write her name, and she smoked a
black pipe. But if it wasn't for the sturdy plebeian blood of her
daughter, Maggie (my mother, Kathie) you wouldn't be here."</p>
<p>Katherine waved it aside. "We'll pass lightly over the
O'Conners. It's the Mackenzies that intrigue me. What more do you
know about them?"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal told all that she could remember hearing from her
sister Belle,--the story of the lovely lady,--of her
reddish-brown hair and tapering fingers, and of the picture that
hung on the landing of the stairway in the great hall.</p>
<p>"That settles it," Katherine arose. "I'm going right up to
Jimmie and bring matters to a climax, by revealing to him just
who I am. Right into the office I go and say, 'Jimmie, here comes
the Lady Katherine Elaine Anders-Mackenzie Deal,
great-great-granddaughter of Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, who had
flowing white fingers and a long reddish-brown nose that tapered
at the end."</p>
<p>When the door had closed behind her, Abbie sighed and said,
"Whatever are you going to do with her, Emma?"</p>
<p>"Oh, she's all right, Mother." Emma was always like Sarah, her
mother, good-natured, easy-going. "She's just breezy. She tells
me everything." Mrs. Mackenzie Deal temporarily disregarded the
recollection of some of the things Katherine had told her.</p>
<p>When they had all gone, Abbie took a great deal of comfort
with her new radio. The dull-finished, beautifully-polished
cabinet put a new interest in life for her. At first in the
wonderment of the thing, she rubbed the Aladdin lamp all day
long. Sermons, jazz bands, market reports, monologues, she
listened to them all with equal interest and amazement. A sermon
from Denver, a talk on fruit tree culture from Lincoln, a dance
orchestra from Omaha, interested her with equal intensity.
Preaching and pruning and prancing, they were all the same to
her. And when "The Ring of the Piper's Tune" came in, she shut
her eyes and saw her Irish mother lift her skirts and do the
Kerry dance as lightly as a thistledown.</p>
<p>"My, I wish you could hear the music, Will."</p>
<p><i>I've heard wondrous music, Abbie.</i></p>
<p>"There's nothing more now, Will, that can be invented."</p>
<p><i>There are things undreamed of, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p>And then Abbie had a letter from Isabelle. She was to sing
from a Chicago station on February third.</p>
<p>"Find the station beforehand, Mother," Isabelle wrote, "so
you'll not have any trouble that night or lose time trying to
locate it while the program is on."</p>
<p>On the night of the third, Abbie sat up later than was her
custom, so that she could hear Isabelle. Even then she
experienced a little trouble in getting the station. "I suppose
nothing's just perfect," she thought. "We always have to have
some little grief to make us . . ." Suddenly she had them. But
the program had begun. Isabelle's voice came forth in an aria as
plainly as though she were in the room. When she had finished,
the announcer spoke. "Mrs. Rhodes will sing her second number
especially for her mother, listening in at Cedartown,
Nebraska."</p>
<p>The piano, with violin accompaniment, played a few notes and
then Isabelle's voice came again, full and clear:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea<br>
Fair and young and gay was she<br>
Beautiful exceedingly<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>And then it came to Abbie Deal. That was it,--the little
half-memory! That was the old strain that had haunted her and
which she could not quite remember.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Many a wooer sought her hand<br>
For she had gold and she had land . . ."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>That was the forgotten melody,--the song of her youth.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Everything at her command<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She was young again, singing on a grassy knoll, with the
future all before her, with the years of her life still
unlived.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh, the Lady of the Lea<br>
Fair and young and gay was she . . ."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Where had they gone, those years? Blown away by the winds you
could not stop,--ticked off by the clock hands you could not
stay.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Dreaming visions longingly<br>
The Lady of the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Isabelle finished the last verse of the song. Abbie turned off
the radio, performed all the little nightly duties about the
house, and undressed for bed. When she had turned out the lights,
she stood for a few minutes at the bedroom window looking out at
the night. It was moonlight and cloudless and very still. The
trees stood etched in black against the white of the snow, their
shadows as real as their substance. For some time Abbie looked
out at the cedars standing silently there in the snow and the
moonlight, like old women listening for something,--perhaps the
strains of a song of their youth, and the dreams of desire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c33" id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In the spring, Katherine's affair with Jimmie Buchanan
culminated in an engagement, duly announced on the part of Mr.
and Mrs. Mackenzie Deal, by way of an elaborate luncheon and the
Sunday papers,--the wedding to take place in the early fall. The
immediate effect upon Abbie was to have her begin a quilt for the
bride-to-be, on Monday morning, as soon as the chickens were fed
and the dishes washed. For some time she pondered whether to do
"The Basket of Flowers" pattern, "The Rising Sun," or "The Rose
of Sharon," eventually deciding on the rose pattern, done in pink
and white. Grace came home to find her in a puddle of pink and
white blocks, her blue-veined fingers trembling a little over the
stitches.</p>
<p>Grace scolded. "Mother, whatever are you doing that for? You
can walk into any department store now and buy these very same
old-fashioned patterns."</p>
<p>"They cost an awful lot."</p>
<p>"Maybe they <i>are</i> expensive. All nice hand work is. But
<i>think</i> of the labor! Please, Mother . . . I'll be glad to
get it for you . . . any pattern you say . . . if you'll just put
the thought about doing it yourself out of your mind."</p>
<p>"No . . . it's more like a real gift if you do it
yourself."</p>
<p>"But, Mother, Katherine wouldn't <i>care.</i> And there'll be
<i>thousands</i> of stitches in it."</p>
<p>"And a thousand thoughts of love caught in the stitches,
Grace."</p>
<p>No, you could not do much with old Abbie Deal when she had
made up her mind.</p>
<p>Sometimes when she had sewed all afternoon she would walk over
to Christine's "to get the cricks out of her back." On a cool
April evening she found Christine sitting up close to her
cook-stove cutting up potatoes for the morrow's planting. She
wore the inevitable faded blue calico dress gathered full at her
portly waist line. Her little greasy braids, neither white nor
gray, nor yet any particular color, were wound flat from ear to
ear.</p>
<p>"Oh . . . So it's you. Come in. Shall I make a light?"
Christine wanted to know. And then added, with characteristic
frugality, "If we sit up close the stove by, we not have to make
it. Ya?"</p>
<p>Abbie looked around for Anna, Christine's granddaughter, who
had been living with her for several years. "Where's Anna,
Christine?"</p>
<p>"Huh!" Christine was evidently disgruntled about something.
"Anna, she's gone to Omaha up."</p>
<p>"Omaha?"</p>
<p>"Ya. To vork . . . until she some money earn." She was
excited. Her broken words came tumbling over each other. "I give
Anna land all the same to her . . . eighty acres. Eighty acres to
every child I give, I tell you. I give Anna the land from her
dead mother. What keep I? Three eighties. Ya! Out of all that
eleven eighties, for myself three I keep. Maybe I starve. Maybe I
go the county house by. How they like their old mother go the
poorhouse by? Anna care nothing. She come by me and say,
'Grandmudder . . . I haf it . . . the land . . . but I haf taxes
to pay. Can I haf money the taxes to pay?' How you like? Huh? The
land I gif her . . . do you hear . . . Abbie Deal? Eighty acres I
gif her and she come already yet and say, 'For taxes no money I
haf.' I say, 'Better you get and money earn for taxes then.
Nein?'"</p>
<p>"Oh, and she's gone?"</p>
<p>"Ya, she's vent."</p>
<p>"But, Christine, Omaha is such a city. Don't you know about
her . . . where she first went?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I guess herself she take care. She svill pigs and corn
shuck. You learn 'em svill and shuck, and demselves they take
care."</p>
<p>"Christine, why don't you sell some of your land and use the
money for yourself? The three eighties you kept for yourself are
worth a lot of money now. Sell one of the eighties and have more
comforts and conveniences."</p>
<p>"Ya . . . and go the poorhouse by. How long I know I live?
Only eighty-two I am. A man I know a hundred-and-four was when he
die. Maybe like dat I live. Maybe twenty year I live yet already.
I guess dey not all my land get. Ya . . . when I die, over it
quick dey fight. Not while here I stay."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal sighed. Well, she thought, one gets out of life
largely what one puts in. Christine had put all her time and
thought on the land and for reward she had . . . land.</p>
<p>As soon as the Cedartown school was out that summer, Laura
came over to spend a few days with her grandmother. Abbie still
found pleasant companionship in this particular grandchild, an
understanding and sympathy deeper than the usual twelve-year-old
girl possessed. The two seemed to hold a oneness of thought, a
kinship of mind as well as of body. With none of Katherine's
sophistication, the child yet seemed mature.</p>
<p>On this visit she would help her grandmother with the
morning's work and then fly to the pencil and tablet which she
kept hidden under the bench by the long double row of cedars. It
was on a late June morning that the two were seated there under
the big trees which, toy-size, the Deals had planted a
half-century before. Laura took out her portfolio from the box
under the bench, with, "Listen, Grandma . . . listen to this that
I wrote this morning. It's about you and Grandfather Deal:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"I know not if 'twas beating rain,<br>
That lightly tapped the window pane,<br>
Or if the dying embers flare<br>
Shone softly on my old arm chair.<br>
<br>
"But in the scent of dusky gloom,<br>
That stole within my chamber room,<br>
It seemed that from the shadowy wall<br>
I dreamed I heard you softly call.<br>
<br>
"Maybe it was only the book I'd read,<br>
But I heard your voice,--you, who are dead.<br>
You called me by a name most dear<br>
And then I knew that you were near."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>There were tears in Abbie Deal's eyes. "Why, Laura,--you
didn't do that yourself?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did."</p>
<p>"But how could you . . . a little girl like you . . . how
<i>could</i> you have the feeling?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know . . . I can't quite tell you. But I get to
thinking about a thing and it almost hurts me . . . kind-of in my
throat or somewhere . . . and then when I work away and get it
all written down, I feel sort of happy afterward. I don't suppose
you'd understand it."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I would," said old Abbie Deal. "I'd understand."</p>
<p>"I like to read my things to you, Grandma."</p>
<p>"And I like to have you, Laura. They seem splendid to me. I
suppose they are not what critics call technically correct, but
that can come with the years. It's the feeling you show."</p>
<p>For a long time they sat there in the morning sunshine under
the cedars that had grown old. The flyer went through town, it's
thick black smoke writing spiral-shaped figures across the blue
slate of the sky. To the east, the wide rolling prairie held on
it's breast the young corn and wheat and the grass of the
pastures. The Reinmueller boys, grandsons of Christine, were
plowing corn, with a new type cultivator. To the south and west,
Cedartown with its comfortable homes and its paved streets
overhung with elms and maples, sat astride the great highway that
was once a buffalo trail. To the north, behind the curving arch
of a wide graveled driveway lay the silent city of the dead,--on
a knoll in the center, the monuments of the Deal and Lutz
families.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"That your life is like a field-glass, Laura. When you look
into the one end, the landscape is dwarfed and far away,--when
you look into the other, it looms large as though it were near at
hand. Things that happened seventy years ago seem like yesterday.
But, when I was a girl, eighty years seemed too remote to
contemplate. And now, it has passed. The story is written."</p>
<p>"You sound as though you were sorry about something,
Grandma."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to, but I was thinking that when I was a little
girl, my sister Belle used to tell me about our grandmother . . .
that would be your great-great-grandmother. Her name was Isabelle
Anders-Mackenzie. She was wealthy and beautiful and accomplished
for her time. I used to think I would grow up to look just like
her. I pictured her as an ideal and I would say to her in my
mind, 'You'll be proud some day of the things I am going to
accomplish.' All my girlhood I always planned to do something big
. . . something constructive. It's queer what ambitious dreams a
girl has when she is young. I thought I would sing before big
audiences or paint lovely pictures or write a splendid book. I
always had that feeling in me of wanting to do something worth
while. And just think, Laura . . . now I am eighty and I have not
painted nor written nor sung."</p>
<p>"But you've done lots of things, Grandma. You've baked bread .
. . and pieced quilts . . . and taken care of your children."</p>
<p>Old Abbie Deal patted the young girl's hand. "Well . . . well
. . . out of the mouths of babes. That's just it, Laura, I've
<i>only</i> baked bread and pieced quilts and taken care of
children. But some women have to, don't they? . . . But I've
dreamed dreams, Laura. All the time I was cooking and patching
and washing, I dreamed dreams. And I think I dreamed them into
the children . . . and the children are carrying them out . . .
doing all the things I wanted to and couldn't. Margaret has
painted for me and Isabelle has sung for me. Grace has taught for
me . . . and you, Laura . . . you'll write my book for me I
think. You'll have a fine education and you will probably travel.
But I don't believe you can write a story because you have a fine
education and have traveled. I think you must first have a seeing
eye and an understanding heart and the knack of expressing what
you see and feel. And you have them. So I think you, too, are
going to do one of the things I wanted to do and never did."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal thoroughly enjoyed talking to this grandchild. Any
of the rest of the family would have been a little impatient with
an old woman's musings. The others were always so alert, so
active, so poised for flight. Of them all, only little Laura Deal
wanted to sit and talk and dream. She told her that now.</p>
<p>"You are a great comfort to me, Laura. You are something like
me . . . a part of me. We think alike . . . you and I. Between
you and me, I think my reminiscences bore the others. Well, well
. . . old people used to bore me when I was young."</p>
<p>"They don't bore <i>me,</i> Grandma. They interest me."</p>
<p>Abbie smiled across at her. No longer could she look down upon
Laura. The twelve-year-old girl was larger than her little
grandmother.</p>
<p>"And we old pioneers dreamed other things, too, Laura. We
dreamed dreams into the country. We dreamed the towns and the
cities, the homes and the factories, the churches and the
schools. We dreamed the huge new capitol. When you walk under its
wonderful tower, you say to yourself, 'My Grandfather and
Grandmother Deal dreamed all this . . . they, and a thousand
other young couples dreamed it all in the early days . . . and
the architect had the imagination to catch the dream and
materialize it. It is their vision solidified. They were like the
foundation stones under the capitol . . . not decorative, but
strong. They were not well-educated. They were not sophisticated.
They were not cultured. But they had innate refinement and
courage. And they could see visions and dream dreams."</p>
<p>"How does it feel to be old, Grandma?"</p>
<p>Abbie laughed. "Laura, it doesn't <i>feel</i> at all. People
don't understand about old age. I am an old woman . . . but
<i>I</i> haven't changed. I'm still Abbie Deal. They think we're
different . . . we old ones. The real Abbie Deal still has many
of the old visions and longings. I'm fairly contented here in the
old home. . . . There was a time when I thought I never could be
. . . but . . . some way . . . we get adjusted. I've never grown
tired of life as some old people do. I'm only tired of the aches
and the pains and the inability to make my body do what I want it
to do. I would like to live a long time yet . . . to see what can
still be invented . . . to read the new things that will be
written . . . to hear the new songs that will be sung . . . to
see heavy foliage on all the new shrubbery . . . to see all the
babies grow into men and women. But there comes an end . . ."</p>
<p>"Don't talk that way, Grandma. It makes me feel like
crying."</p>
<p>"Why, it ought not, Laura . . . not when Grandma has happy
memories to live over."</p>
<p>"What memories do you have, Grandma?"</p>
<p>"I have many . . . my little girlhood days when Chicago was a
village . . . the three weeks' journey from Illinois into Iowa .
. . the fun in the Big Woods behind my sister Janet's house. I
can shut my eyes and smell the dampness and the Mayflowers there.
The old log school and then the new white one with green shutters
. . . my wedding . . . the trip from Iowa into Nebraska. . . .
There are many memories. But I'll tell you the one I like to
think of best of all. It's just a homely everyday thing, but to
me it is the happiest of them all. It is evening time here in the
old house and the supper is cooking and the table is set for the
whole family. It hurts a mother, Laura, when the plates begin to
be taken away one by one. First there are seven and then six and
then five . . . and on down to a single plate. So I like to think
of the table set for the whole family at supper time. The robins
are singing in the cottonwoods and the late afternoon sun is
shining across the floor. Will, your grandfather, is coming in to
supper . . . and the children are all playing out in the yard. I
can hear their voices and happy laughter. There isn't much to
that memory is there? Out of a lifetime of experiences you would
hardly expect that to be the one I would choose as the happiest,
would you? But it is. The supper cooking . . . the table set for
the whole family . . . the afternoon sun across the floor . . .
the robins singing in the cottonwoods . . . the children's merry
voices . . . Will coming in . . . eventide."</p>
<p>"I think it's a nice memory, Grandma, but something about the
way you say it makes me sad."</p>
<p>"But it's not sad, Laura. My memories are not sad. They're
pleasant. I'm happy when I'm living them over. You'll find out
when you get old, Laura, that some of the realities seem dreams .
. . but the dreams, Laura, . . . the dreams are all real."</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><a name="c34" id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>That summer,--the one in which Abbie Deal was eighty,--was the
summer of the Great Harvest.</p>
<p>Nebraska was favored of the gods. Ceres' throne was in
Nebraska. It was as though she chose the state from all others
upon which to lavish her goods,--as though the bulk of her
fortune had been given to a favorite child. From the old Missouri
to the foot of the sand-hills,--from the Kansas border to the
land of the Dakotas, the wheat fields, like the sun's reflection,
lay ripe under the July sky. In every direction one saw a
thrasher belching out its yellow breath of wheat straw.</p>
<p>The fields were springs from which never-ending brooklets of
yellow wheat, pouring into the thrashers, rolled forth in golden
streams to form a mighty river of grain.</p>
<p>The barley, rye and oats yield was also heavy. The beet sugar
output was to be of gigantic proportions. A bumper corn crop
loomed in promise for the fall,--three hundred million bushels
were being predicted. Those who juggled with figures said that it
would bring four hundred million dollars. The combined sum of all
the grain figures was almost beyond comprehension. Poor
conditions in many of the neighboring states, and a shortage in
production in the east and south, added to the fancy that
Nebraska seemed to hold the gifts of the gods in her lap that
summer.</p>
<p>The crop moved to market in an unprecedented volume. The
various transportation systems had prepared for their part in
this great procession of the grains. Tens of thousands of workers
had bent their backs to the task. Tens of thousands of freight
cars had been assembled at various points, awaiting the signal to
move. And the grain came in,--and the cars moved. To the east and
to the west they moved for weeks, carrying new life blood to the
nation.</p>
<p>It filled old Abbie Deal with an overwhelming pride. "Do you
know, John," she said to her attorney son, "it makes me happy . .
. proud and happy. When I think of all those early lean years . .
. the droughts . . . the grasshoppers . . . the crop failures . .
. and then this! 'Poor Nebraska' people said. They looked down on
us . . . as though we were a lot of destitute relations. They
sent us old clothes and seeds and dried apples. And to think
we're sending grain in great trainloads."</p>
<p>"Mother," John chuckled, "to hear you, anybody would think you
owned the state."</p>
<p>"I do, John. She's mine in spirit. I feel as though she had
been on trial before a world court and the trial dragged out over
many years. We, who loved her, had faith to believe she would
come through unscathed. And in these later years she's acquitted
. . . and vindicated. And to think she's one of the wealthiest
states in the union . . . the only one, I guess, with no bonded
indebtedness! I wish your father might have lived to see it. He
was so loyal . . . and so faithful . . . and so hopeful. He
didn't live to see all his hopes fulfilled . . . but he did his
part in making them materialize. They were prophets, John . . .
prophets in a strange country . . . those hardy young men who
ferried across the Missouri and forded the Platte and the Weeping
Water and the other streams. What a legacy they've left you
all,--farms and cities . . . cattle on a thousand hills, . . .
manufactories, . . . great educational institutions . . ."</p>
<p>"Mother, that sounds quite oratorical. You can put all that
into a speech up at Lincoln on the twenty-ninth. That's what I
came over to see you about. They told me in Lincoln to-day that
they wanted you to come up and speak at the unveiling of the
Donovan Marker. That's the sixtieth anniversary, you know, of
choosing the site of Lincoln for the capital. They want those
present who were here then."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I wasn't here, John. That was almost a whole year
before we came. I've only been here fifty-nine years."</p>
<p>"Fifty-nine years is quite a while, Mother, and you're getting
to be one of the few left, who came that long ago. They want you
to make a little talk."</p>
<p>"But what can you say in a few words, John, that will cover
fifty-nine years? I guess 'Behold what God hath wrought,' is the
most condensed statement I can think of."</p>
<p>And then it turned out that there were to be two big events
for Abbie Deal in July. Katherine's wedding, which was to have
been in the fall, was suddenly set for the twentieth. John was
sending Jimmie Buchanan east on business, and in spite of the
off-season time of year, the wedding was to take place so that
Katherine could go with him. Already Katherine was being dined
and fêted and showered by the friends who were still in town.
Sarah Lutz was in California and was not coming back. "So
<i>you</i> must be careful and not get sick, Granny," Katherine
told her, "or we wouldn't have either of you at the big doings."
She and her mother had driven down one afternoon to see Abbie.
They brought her a lavender silk dress and a real lace
cape-collar which Emma had bought in Vienna.</p>
<p>"You must be all dolled up, Granny," Katherine told her. "You
must be massaged and manicured and you ought to have a permanent.
I believe you would take a lovely one." She bent low over her
grandmother's head and examined a strand of snow-white hair. "It
looks as though it might have had a bit of natural curl in it
once."</p>
<p>Oh, why couldn't they know? Why did an old woman seem always
to have been old? Abbie was back on the knoll near the Big Woods,
singing . . . her head thrown back . . . her thick hair curling
and rippling over her creamy white shoulders. Why couldn't they
understand that once she had kept tryst with Youth? Why didn't
they realize that some day, they, too, must hold rendezvous with
Age?</p>
<p>"Yes," said old Abbie Deal, simply, "it used to be quite
curly."</p>
<p>It was just before they left, that Abbie said, "I have two
presents for you, Kathie."</p>
<p>"Two, Granny? How lovely! Why two?"</p>
<p>"Well, one I am making myself so that you will always have
something of Grandma's hand work. The other . . . the other,
Kathie, is an heirloom, a string of little pearls. I want you not
to plan for anything else for your neck. They're beautiful. Even
you, with all your nice things, will be proud to own them."</p>
<p>"Fine . . . Granny! Fine!" Even so, it was said half
carelessly. Things had come so easily to Kathie.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks, Abbie worked hard to finish the pink
and white quilt with its rose-shaped blocks rambling up the
borders. On the nineteenth, Grace came from summer school where
she was teaching, and left immediately for Omaha in her roadster,
as she had some shopping to do before the wedding. Early on the
morning of the twentieth, Christine Reinmueller came over to
receive her instructions from Abbie for caring for the place. The
chickens were to be fed. Abbie gave minute directions for the
ceremony,--the laying hens in the chicken-yard, whole corn out of
one box,--the fries so-and-so out of a certain can. If it looked
like rain, Christine was to turn the water-spout into the
cistern. But if it rained too long, it ought to be turned out
before it started to run over. And Christine was to pick the
sweet-peas and nasturtiums.</p>
<p>John and Eloise Deal, with Wentworth and Laura and Millard,
came for Abbie in the big sedan. Abbie had on her black silk with
white collar and cuffs, and a new hat with a noble-appearing
pom-pon on one side, which the milliner had told her looked
"chic." Above Abbie's old wrinkled face it looked as chic as a
painted one would have looked atop the portrait of Whistler's
mother.</p>
<p>She had the quilt done up in a big flat package, and she put
her feet on it in the car, as though it might, from sheer
naturalness of the roses, ramble out of the sedan window. The
pearls in the little box she held tightly in the bag in her
hands.</p>
<p>The big car shot out over the graveled roads. Wentworth was at
the wheel. Abbie wished John would do the driving. As a matter of
fact Wentworth, born to the wheel, with all the younger
generation, was the more alert driver, but Abbie could not think
so.</p>
<p>"You know, Wentworth, I wish you wouldn't go so fast. Can't we
go a little slower and see the country better?"</p>
<p>"You're sort of cracked about the country, aren't you,
Grandma?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I guess I am, Wentworth. But if you'd gone over these
same roads in a covered wagon, when there wasn't even a trail in
the grass, you'd be, too."</p>
<p>At the top of a hill, John said something to his son, and the
big car slowed down and stopped. "Take a drink, Mother," John
waved his hand to the panorama before them, "but don't get
intoxicated."</p>
<p>In the distance the Platte sprawled out lazily in the morning
sun, the thick foliage of its tree-borders green against the
sky's summer blue. There were acres of yellow wheat stubble where
once the buffalo had wallowed, fields of young corn where once
the prairie grass had grown, great comfortable homes and barns
where once the soddies had stood. There were orchards and
pastures and cattle, and a town nestling under the sheltering
shade of huge trees. And soft white languorous clouds slipped
into the east.</p>
<p>As they looked, there was a humming sound, and like one of the
dragon-flies from the old creek bed, an aeroplane came out of the
southwest. As direct and as fast as the southwest winds, it shot
toward Omaha, back over the road that the Deals' and Lutzes' and
the Reinmuellers' plodding oxen had come. From the hilltop near
the Platte, Abbie Deal watched the mail plane go back over the
road that the plodding oxen had come.</p>
<p>They slipped into Omaha at ten o'clock,--the Omaha that had
been the raw frontier town, but was now a city of nearly a
quarter million.</p>
<p>Mack, at home from the bank, came out to meet them when they
turned into the driveway. The Mackenzie Deal place, a huge brick
structure, with its clipped lawn and its sunken garden and its
lily pools, was lovely in the morning sunlight. And it belonged
to a man who had lived in a soddie until his thirteenth year, and
to a woman whose first home on the prairie was hung with burlap
to keep out the cold.</p>
<p>"Let me take your bag, Mother."</p>
<p>"Take the package, Mack, but I want to carry this myself." And
they all laughed that Mother would trust no one with the pearls.
She got slowly out of the car, her limbs a little numb. For a few
moments she could not walk steadily, so that Mack put his arm
around her and helped her up the wide steps.</p>
<p>In the house, Abbie asked at once for Katherine. The moment
had come. It had been sixty-two years coming and now it was here.
The winds had blown it by . . . the winds she could not stop. The
clock hands had ticked it off . . . the time she could not
stay.</p>
<p>Old Abbie Deal, with her snow-white hair, and her eighty years
beginning to sit heavily upon her, climbed the mahogany-railed
stairway with its imported carpet. A ladder with sapling
cross-pieces . . . bare pine steps . . . a mahogany-railed
stairway with thick imported carpet.</p>
<p>Katherine was in her room. Abbie knocked and went in, the
little bag tightly clutched in her hand.</p>
<p>"Well . . . Granny?" Katherine did not seem flippant to-day.
She was gentle, a little tender. She kissed her grandmother with
genuine affection and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>"Here they are, dear." Abbie laid the pearls in Katherine's
lap, her blue-veined hands trembling.</p>
<p>It was as though they had brought everything to
Katherine,--had heaped their all into her lap,--the fruits of
their labor, the results of their pioneering. The price of the
prairie had been paid. The debt was canceled. For Katherine they
had fought the prairie fires, split open the prairie furrows, and
planted the corn. For Katherine they had set out the trees and
made the roads and built the bridges.</p>
<p>Katherine took the pearls out of the little velvet box.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Granny, dear. They're darling."</p>
<p>There was no great surprise. She had spoken in a
matter-of-fact way. "Thanks, Granny, dear. They're darling."
Well, she could not sense it. She was young and had never wanted
for a thing in her life. She could not realize all the hardships
which had been undergone since Abbie Deal's wedding night,--all
the privations which had been endured while the pearls lay in the
box for sixty-two years waiting for the time to come when a
Mackenzie bride could wear them.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you about them. Could you . . . for just a few
minutes, Kathie? I don't want to take your time . . ."</p>
<p>"Sure . . . Granny . . . tell me about them."</p>
<p>"They were Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie's, Kathie. After her
death they became my mother's and then she gave them to me in the
old log-cabin on my wedding night. They always seemed to me a
sort of symbol . . . standing for everything that was fine and
artistic and lovely. You probably don't understand, but the work
on the land in our early days was so hard that it took all of our
time and strength to keep body and soul together. There was
neither time nor opportunity for the things that many of us
wanted, with all our hearts, to do. But we kept our eyes on a
sort of gleam ahead, a hope that our boys and girls could have
all the things we could not have. And so the pearls became a
symbol to me of those things. I said Margaret could wear them at
her wedding, thinking we would have everything to go with them.
But you can't always do with life as you wish. Sometimes life
does things to you. And so we didn't have much to do with, and
Margaret was married without them. Isabelle was married suddenly
on the eve of war, and Grace never married . . . and now they're
yours, the first granddaughter to marry. They've gone in a sort
of circle, from wealth, through hard times, back to
prosperity."</p>
<p>"I'll love them, Granny." Katherine kissed her grandmother
again. Then she rose and slipped her arm through Abbie's. "Now,
Granny, I want you to come in and see the spoils of war."</p>
<p>Out in the upper hall, with Persian rugs hanging over the
mahogany-railed balcony, most of the relatives seemed gathering.
Margaret and Dr. Baker had just driven in. Isabelle and Harrison
Rhodes had arrived the previous evening. Stanley's and young Dr.
Fred's wives were both there with their children. One room had
been converted into a receiving room for the gifts, and it was
into this one that the whole clan gathered. Dainty gifts from
exclusive shops were there. Many countries had contributed their
loveliest to Katherine Deal. Abbie, wandering among the tables,
made little clucking noises of delight. "My, my, Kathie, whatever
can you do with them all? How beautiful! And to think that I was
happy to get some quilts and plain dishes and an old rooster and
six hens!"</p>
<p>Mack came in and wandered aimlessly about. Every one was there
in the room, now,--Mack and Emma, Isabelle and Harrison, Margaret
and Doctor Baker, Grace, John and Eloise, Laura, Wentworth,
Stanley's and Fred Jr.'s wives, Katherine and Jimmie
Buchanan--Suddenly it seemed to Abbie that there was some
concerted plan that they should all gather. Two or three were
whispering mysteriously.</p>
<p>"Are you ready, Daddy?" It was Katherine. "There's something
else we want to show you, Granny. We're too anxious for you to
see."</p>
<p>Abbie turned toward Katherine who was holding the cord of a
silken drape in her hand. Katherine's head was thrown back. Her
eyes were merry. She was excited about something. "All set. Eyes
front and guide right, Granny."</p>
<p>She pulled the silken cord and the drape parted. Behind the
soft folds there hung a huge painting in a wide dull gold
frame,--the painting of a lovely lady in velvet draperies, her
reddish-brown hair curling over her shoulder, and a string of
pearls at her neck. A hat with a sweeping plume was in one
hand,--held by long slender fingers that tapered at the ends.</p>
<p>Katherine waved an airy hand. "Here she is, Granny. Allow me
to introduce to you Isabelle Anders-Mackenzie, painted with my
pearls on her . . . the little wretch."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal stared. The faint coloring of excitement under her
old cheeks slipped away. One hand went up to her wrinkled throat
and the other above her pounding heart. She turned to Mack. "You
don't . . . not really, Mack? It isn't . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, Mother . . . your grandmother . . . my
great-grandmother . . . Kathie's great-great-grandmother. It's
the original and it cost like the old Harry, but Katherine has
been after me ever since she heard you tell about it. I had the
deuce of a time getting it, too. The agent traced it from
Aberdeen to London and then to Edinburgh and back to London."</p>
<p>Abbie turned to the picture again.</p>
<p>"Can you beat it, Granny?" Katherine was laughing and calling
to her. "All in one fell swoop I get six tons of china, nine
carloads of silver, a darling new house, a homely new husband,
<i>and</i> a snobocratic ancestor and her pearls."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal stood in front of the picture with Katherine's
flippant words rippling past her. Old Abbie Deal, with her
snow-white hair in its neat little knot at the back of her head,
with her dumpy pudding-bag figure and her long, gnarled fingers
that tapered at the ends, stood and stared at the picture. And
standing there, looking up at the lovely lady, old Abbie Deal
began to cry. They are the most painful tears in the world . . .
the tears of the aged . . . for they come from dried beds where
the emotions have long burned low.</p>
<p>Mack put an arm around his mother and patted her shoulder
awkwardly. "Why, Mother, dear! Katherine, we shouldn't have . . .
I never thought, Mother . . . only the pleasure . . ."</p>
<p>They all closed around her, making comments. Jimmie Buchanan
and Wentworth stood off, a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>The others all explained it volubly to each other.</p>
<p>"It was too much of a surprise . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, she's too old to have a surprise sprung . . ."</p>
<p>"The trip up here was too much for mother at her age."</p>
<p>"It's those weeks of sewing. I told her that quilt was too
much . . ."</p>
<p>"No,--it's the whole excitement together."</p>
<p>Laura Deal came through the little knot. "It isn't <i>any</i>
of those reasons, is it, Grandma?" she said. "I know what it is .
. . but I don't know how to say it."</p>
<p>Abbie dried her eyes. "I'm all right now." She even smiled at
them. "My, my, Kathie, tears on your wedding day. Whatever will
you think? How selfish of me,--I'm that ashamed! But when I saw .
. . when I saw the lovely lady that I used to dream about . . .
it just came over me . . . in a sort of wave . . . all the
wonderful things I planned to do when I was young . . . and never
did."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c35" id="c35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Abbie was back in her bedroom and dressed, now, for the
wedding, in the lavender silk with the lace collar from Vienna.
Margaret had dressed her hair and Isabelle had manicured her
nails and Grace had powdered her skin,--with Abbie a little
uncertain of the outcome as though, in her excitement, Grace
might have purchased gunpowder by mistake.</p>
<p>She loved the beauty of everything connected with the affair,
but she was tired. It was queer how much more she could stand
around home than when she was away. The work in the house, the
care of the chickens and flowers,--the whole responsibility of
the home place was not so tiring as something unusual and out of
the ordinary like this.</p>
<p>It was nearly time to go to the church when there was a little
movement outside the door and she heard Katherine's voice, "I
want to see grandmother."</p>
<p>The door opened and Katherine stood on the threshold, in the
exquisite whiteness of filmy lace, her eyes luminous, her face
softened.</p>
<p>"My . . . my!" Abbie Deal raised her hands in admiration, "you
take my breath away. You look like <i>her,</i> Kathie . . . but
you're even lovelier."</p>
<p>With a swift little movement of the short lacy skirt,
Katherine was across the floor and down by her grandmother. She
caught Abbie Deal's wrinkled old hands in her firm young ones.
"Granny . . . I wanted to see you a minute. You've not liked me a
lot of times, I know. We've been miles apart most of the time . .
. but I wanted to come in and tell you that nothing really counts
but Jimmie. Oh, Granny, I'd go with Jimmie . . . just as you did
with grandfather. I'd live on pumpkin seeds, you know." She was
laughing a little, with moist eyes. "And dig a house in the side
of a tree, just as you did . . . you know . . . all those things
I've heard you tell about . . . Oh, heavens, I'm going to cry and
I'm all made up, but Granny . . . I wanted you to know . . .
that, after all. I'm just a lot of things you think I'm not . . .
Oh, you won't understand . . ."</p>
<p>Abbie Deal patted the lacy shoulders and with gentle old
fingers touched the upturned face. "Why of course, Kathie, . . .
of course, dear, . . . Grandma understands, the clock hands go
round . . . and Grandma understands . . ."</p>
<p>The wedding was all that the wedding of Mackenzie Deal's
daughter would be,--a thing of extravagant simplicity. There were
beribboned pews, soft lights, and chaste white tapers in silver
candelabra against green palms. There was the organ's mellow
voice and the rich contralto one of the bride's aunt, Isabelle
Deal Rhodes, the well-known Chicago singer. There was Mackenzie
Deal with his bald head and his horn-rimmed glasses and a lump in
his throat. There was Mrs. Mackenzie Deal in her orchid and
silver lace, a little too concerned over the details of the
affair to think of her emotions. There were all the Deal
relatives, well-groomed and prosperous-looking. And there was old
Abbie Deal, sunk down low in the pew, the lavender silk dress
with its lace collar from Vienna over her pudding-bag body, a
knot of white hair at the nape of her neck, her tapering, gnarled
fingers trembling with age in her lap.</p>
<p>The bride was at the altar now,--lovely Katherine, in her
white lace and satin, with the heirloom of pearls around her
neck. Old Abbie's thoughts went over the cycle of one hundred and
thirty-five years. Satin and pearls in a Scottish mansion,--a
peasant dress and a head-shawl in an Irish hut,--a wine-colored
hoop-skirted merino in a log cabin,--a navy-blue silk in a
cottonwood and pine farmhouse,--white lace and satin and the
pearls again in their beautiful modern setting.</p>
<p>"Do you take this man . . . for better . . . for worse . . .
death do you part?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>The same solemn question, solemnly answered. Would it be as
faithfully kept? Abbie wondered.</p>
<p>And now it was all over. Katherine and Jimmie had left for the
east. The big house had been quietly put to rights by two
soft-footed maids. The whole Deal clan was gathering in the
sun-room with its striking green and black and orchid English
chintz hangings, and its fountain spraying over cool ferns and
rocks.</p>
<p>Emma was bustling about hospitably, seeing that every one was
comfortable. "Come on in, Donald. Sit here, Grace."</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway, Abbie heard Margaret coaxing Fred
Jr.'s youngest with "Come to Grandma, Baby." It was still hard
for Abbie to remember that two of her children were
grandparents.</p>
<p>Then they saw her standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Come in, Mother."</p>
<p>"Sit here, Mother."</p>
<p>"No,--over here, Mother."</p>
<p>Mack brought a cushion, Isabelle a stool.</p>
<p>"Are you comfortable, Mother?"</p>
<p>How they thought of her bodily comfort,--always her physical
needs. Not one ever said, "Are you sad, Mother?" or "How does
your mind feel?" or "Does anything hurt your heart?"</p>
<p>Abbie, sitting in the big ivory chair with cushions at her
back, found herself slipping away from the group, standing apart
from it, looking at the members of it in a detached way. How
efficient they all were,--and how smart,--and how easily they did
things. They went hither and yon, either for business or pleasure
affairs,--into Chicago, down south . . . sometimes abroad. Mack,
now, was saying something about going down to New York the last
of the week.</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> had a chance . . ." For the first time Abbie Deal
spoke. Her voice cracked a little because of its age. From the
depths of the big chair it cracked in its earnestness. "<i>I</i>
had a chance to go to New York once."</p>
<p>Grace looked up quickly and then walked over to Isabelle. She
spoke very low and turned her head so that her mother might not
hear: "See! That's what I've been telling you. I've noticed that
in her quite a little lately. Just detached sentences like that
with no special meaning. It would just <i>kill</i> me if her mind
. . . at the last. . . . But she does that quite often, now.
'Well, well, the clock hands go 'round,' she'll say, right out of
a clear sky. Or, 'Dear, dear, the winds blew it all away.' And
now this one, '<i>I</i> had a chance to go to New York, once,' .
. . childish, that way."</p>
<p>In the big chair, Abbie Deal was chuckling a little to
herself, shaking with silent laughter.</p>
<p>"What's the joke, Mother?" Mack spoke from across the
room.</p>
<p>"Nothing much. I was just wondering about all of you . . . now
. . . if I had gone."</p>
<p>"See . . . ?" Grace was grave in her anxiety, ". . . like
<i>that."</i></p>
<p>Abbie Deal sat looking out at the family gathered there in the
beautiful sun-parlor, sat there with half-closed eyes like an old
Buddha looking out on the generations. Eighty years of living
were behind her,--most of them spent in fighting,--fighting the
droughts, the snows, the hot winds, the prairie fires, the
blizzards,--fighting for the children's physical and mental and
spiritual development, fighting to make a civilization on the raw
prairie. Bending her back to the toil, hiding her heart's
disappointments, giving her all in service, she was like an old
mother partridge who had plucked all the feathers from her breast
for the nest of her young.</p>
<p>Old Abbie Deal, so near the borderland now that she held
intercourse with both worlds, sat there looking out through
half-closed eyes at the children and the grandchildren and the
great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>"Well, Will . . . there they all are. What do you think of
them? I did the best I could."</p>
<p><i>You did well, Abbie-girl.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="c36" id="c36">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Grace Deal, in her roadster, went back to summer school early
in the morning. John Deal and his family left about the same time
for Cedartown. Isabelle and Harrison Rhodes were remaining in
Omaha for a few days' visit at Mack's, before making the rounds
of the other homes. Abbie rode back with Margaret and Dr.
Baker.</p>
<p>On the way, Margaret asked: "Don't you want to go on up to
Lincoln with us for a few days, Mother?"</p>
<p>"No. Oh, no," Abbie said hastily. "I'm tired and I'll be real
glad to get home again."</p>
<p>When the big car stopped under the Lombardy poplars near the
sitting-room porch of the old farmhouse, Margaret got out with
her mother and helped her up the short walk to the house.</p>
<p>"I just can't bear to leave you here alone, Mother. Don't you
want me to stay all night with you? Fred could run out and get me
to-morrow or I could go in on the morning train."</p>
<p>"No. Oh, no. I'm all right. I'm just tired from the
excitement. When you're used to being alone you don't mind it a
bit."</p>
<p>"Promise me you would call some one on the phone the first
minute you didn't feel well."</p>
<p>"I promise. I would call Christine. She's got a phone in now,
but she certainly begrudges the money. Anyway, I won't be alone
much more this summer. Isabelle will be here next week, and Grace
will be home again soon, and Laura is going to come and stay a
few days."</p>
<p>When they had gone, Abbie Deal opened some of the windows to
air out the house. She had a whimsical notion that the things
seemed glad to have her back,--the table where old Doc Matthews
had rolled his pills, the walnut cupboard, Will's corner
what-not. There was something human about them as though they
shared her thoughts,--as though, having come up through the years
with her, they held the same memories.</p>
<p>She fed her chickens, watered the sweet-peas, picked the dried
leaves off her geraniums, and went over the whole yard as though
to greet every bush and shrub after her absence.</p>
<p>For the next few days she went slowly about her household
duties with the same little sense of pleasure she always
experienced after she had been to one of the children's homes.
How could old women bear to sit around with folded hands? What
mattered it that the children all had such nice houses, there
would never be any real home for her but the old wing-and-upright
set in the cedars and poplars.</p>
<p>By Friday night she had accomplished a lot of extra small
tasks, setting an old hen that was foolishly wanting to raise a
family out of season, gathering some early poppy-seeds and
putting fresh papers on her pantry shelves. At five-thirty she
started her supper. As she worked she tried to hum an old tune
she had known when she was young, an old song she had not thought
of for years and years, until Isabelle had sung it over the radio
in the winter:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Oh . . . the La . . . dy of . . . the Lea,<br>
Fair and . . . young and . . . gay was . . .
she"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She had to make long pauses between the syllables to get her
breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Beau . . . tiful . . . exceed . . . ingly<br>
The La . . . dy of . . . the Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Her voice cracked and went up or down without her volition, so
that even though her mind heard the song, her ear scarcely
recognized the melody.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"Many . . . a woo . . . er sought her . . .
hand<br>
For she . . . had gold . . . and she . . . had land,<br>
Every . . . thing . . . la la . . . la la"</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She had forgotten what the words were right there.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><i>"The La . . . dy of . . . the
Lea."</i></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>She was completely out of breath, so that she had to sit down
a few minutes before starting to put her dishes on the kitchen
table. As she sat looking at the old table, she suddenly wished
that she could pull it out, put in all the leaves, set the places
for the children and then call them in from play,--not the
prosperous grown people she had been with so recently in Omaha,
but just as they were when they were little. Queer how plainly
she could see them in her mind: Mack's merry round face with its
sprinkling of freckles, Margaret's long dark pig-tail, her gray
eyes and her laughter, Isabelle's reddish-brown curls and her big
brown eyes, Grace's square little body with her apron-strings
always untied, John's serious face,--a sort of little old man who
did not want to be hugged. How real they seemed to her. One could
almost imagine that it was they who were playing, "Run, Sheep
Run" out there now instead of the neighbor children.</p>
<p>Abbie Deal had never forbidden the north-end children access
to her yard, and their high-pitched voices calling "Going-east .
. . going west . . ." came to her now from the region of the
cottonwood windbreak. Yes, it sounded for all the world like her
own children out there.</p>
<p>As she got up and went about her supper, putting a little
piece of meat on to cook, her mind slipped to the fact that she
had promised to make a short talk on the following week at the
sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the city of Lincoln. She
must begin to think of what she could say. There was plenty to
talk about but she dreaded the speaking. She hoped her voice
wouldn't quaver and break. That was the trouble of being old.
Your body no longer obeyed you. It did unruly and unreasonable
things. An eye suddenly might not see for a moment. Your knees
gave out at the wrong time, so that when you thought you were
walking north, you might find yourself going a little northwest.
Your brain, too, had that same flighty trick. You might be
speaking of something and forget it temporarily,--your mind going
off at a little to the northwest, too, so to speak.</p>
<p>She glanced up to see what time it was, and discovered that
the clock had stopped. Whatever had happened to the faithful old
thing? It must be wearing out, for she was sure she had wound
it.</p>
<p>She opened the door with the little brown church painted on
the glass, and reached for the key. Suddenly,--so suddenly that
it was like a flash,--a queer feeling came over Abbie Deal. It
was unlike any she had ever experienced,--a tightening of the
throat and chest as of cold icy hands upon her. She tried to take
her arms down from their stretched position, but it was almost
impossible to move them for the pain. In a moment the icy hands
released their hold upon her as quickly as they had clutched at
her, but they left her so weak and shaken that she started into
her bedroom holding onto the backs of the chairs.</p>
<p>She lay down on her bed to get herself in hand. There was a
sharp pain now in the back of her head and it seemed a little
hard to breathe. For a moment she wondered if it could be that
her time to die had come. No, that could not be. She was a little
sick, but she had been so many times, "I never <i>do</i> die,"
she said to herself and smiled a little at the humor of it.</p>
<p>The sun's rays slanted along the floor from the west
sitting-room windows. The meat was cooking, for the air was
filled with the odor of it. Robins were singing outside in the
poplars. The neighbors' children ran across the yard with cries
of "All's out's in free." They would trample the grass a little,
but children were worth more than grass anyway. She must not get
sick, for she was planning to go to something in a few days. For
a few moments she could not think what it was, and then she
remembered. It was the old settlers' meeting in Lincoln. There
would be a lot of old folks there and they would tell their
reminiscences all day. No doubt she would be bored to
distraction. Old people usually bored her. No, that was not
right. Something was wrong with that thought. She was not young.
She was <i>old.</i> She, herself, was one of the old settlers.
How strange! Well, she would go. Her mind seemed not quite under
control. She tried hard to think whether she was to go in the big
shining sedan on the straight graveled roads or in the creaking
wagon through the long swaying grass. <i>Blow</i> . . . <i>wave .
. . ripple</i> . . . <i>dip. Blow . . . wave</i> . . .
<i>ripple</i> . . . <i>dip.</i> She felt ill. It was the swaying
of the prairie grass that made her ill.</p>
<p>If she were taken sick she had promised to do
something,--something with the little brown box at the side of
the bed. Suddenly, she remembered . . . call Christine. That was
it. Good old Christine! . . . Old friends . . . were best. Maybe
she ought to call Christine in the little brown box. Her arm
slipped around the rolled silk quilt at the foot of the bed. Such
a soft silk quilt . . . and an old patched quilt in front of a
sheep-shed for a door. There it was again,--her mind going
northwest.</p>
<p>The sun slanted farther across the carpet. Whoever was frying
that meat, was letting it burn. The children shouted very close
to the house: "Run, sheep, run." It was nice to know the children
were all well and out there playing,--Mack and Margaret, John and
Isabelle, Grace and the baby. She hoped they were taking good
care of the baby,--the baby with a face like a little white rose.
She would let them play on until she got to feeling better, and
then she would get up and finish supper.</p>
<p>That queer thought of death intruded itself again, but she
reasoned, slowly and simply, with it. If death were near she
would be frightened. Death was her enemy. All her life she had
hated death and feared it. It had taken her mother, and Will and
the baby and countless old friends. But Death was not near. The
children playing outdoors, the sun slanting over the familiar
carpet, the meat frying for supper,--all the old simple things to
which she was accustomed, reassured her. A warm feeling of
contentment slipped over her to hear the children's happy voices.
"All's out's in free," they called. It was almost time for Will
to come in to his supper. It was the nicest part of the day--the
robins singing in the poplars--the meat cooking--the supper table
set--every one coming home--the whole family around the
table--all--Will--the children. She must wind the clock before
they came in. You--couldn't--stop--Time--</p>
<p>It was hard again to breathe,--the icy pain--in her
chest--</p>
<p><i>Oh</i> . . .</p>
<p>Immediately the children were quiet. The robin had stopped
singing. Whoever had been frying meat had removed it from the
stove, and some one must have pulled down all the shades. It was
strange to have all those things happen at once,--the robin cease
singing, the children stop playing, the meat taken from the
stove, and the shades pulled down. For a moment it was as though
one could neither see nor hear nor smell. At any rate she felt
much better. The pressure in her chest and in the back of her
head was gone. That was nice. It seemed good to be relieved of
that. She breathed easily,--so very easily that she seemed not to
be breathing at all. She sat up on the edge of the bed. She felt
light, buoyant. "I'll wind the clock and finish supper now and
call them in."</p>
<p>Through the semi-darkness of the house there was no sight or
sound. But as she looked up, she saw Will standing in the
doorway. For a moment she thought he was standing under
honey-locust branches in a lane, but saw at once that it was only
shadows.</p>
<p>"Well, Will!" She stood up. "I'm so glad you're home. You've
been away all day, haven't you? Where were you, Will? Isn't that
stupid of me not to remember?" She moved lightly toward him, but
suddenly stopped, sensing that for some reason there was a
strangeness about his presence. She stood looking at him
questioningly, a little confused.</p>
<p>Will was looking intently at her, half-smiling. She would have
thought he was joking her--teasing her a little--if his
expression had not been too tender for that.</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand, Will. Did you want something of me?
. . ." That was a way of Will's,--always so quiet that you almost
had to read his mind. There was no answer, but at once she seemed
to know that Will was waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Oh, I must tell the children first. They <i>never</i> want me
to go." She turned to the window. "Listen, children," she called,
"I'm going away with Father. If some one would pull up the shades
I could see you, but it doesn't really matter. Listen closely . .
. I'm only going to be gone a little while. Be good children . .
. You'll get along just fine."</p>
<p>She turned to the doorway. "It seems a little dark. You know,
Will, I think we will need the lantern. I've always kept the
lantern . . ." Her voice trailed off into nothing. For Will was
still smiling at her, questioningly, quizzically,--but with
something infinitely more tender,--something protecting,
enveloping. Slowly it came to her. Hesitatingly she put her hand
up to her throat. "Will . . . you don't mean it! . . . Not
<i>that</i> . . . not <i>Death</i> . . . so <i>easy?</i> That
it's nothing more than <i>this</i> . . . ? Why . . .
<i>Will!</i>"</p>
<p>Abbie Deal moved lightly, quickly, over to her husband,
slipped her hand into his and went with him out of the old house,
past the Lombardy poplars, through the deepening prairie
twilight,--into the shadows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was old Christine Reinmueller, who came in and found
her.</p>
<p><i>"Ach</i> . . . <i>Gott!"</i> She wrung her hard old hands.
"Mine friend . . . de best voman dat efer on de eart'
valked."</p>
<p>The children all came hastily in response to the messages. In
the old parlor with the what-not and the marble-topped stand and
the blue plush album, they said the same things over and over to
each other.</p>
<p>"Didn't she seem as well to you last week as ever?"</p>
<p>"Do you suppose she suffered much?"</p>
<p>"Or called for us?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it <i>dreadful.</i> Poor mother . . . all alone . . .
not one of us here . . . as though we had all forsaken her just
when she needed us most . . . and after all she's done for us . .
."</p>
<p>It was then that little twelve-year-old Laura Deal turned away
from the window where she had been looking down the long double
row of cedars and said in a voice so certain that it was almost
exalted:</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> don't think it's so dreadful. I think it was kind-of
nice. Maybe she didn't miss you. Maybe she didn't miss you <i>at
all.</i> One time grandma told me she was the very happiest when
she was living over all her memories. Maybe . . ." She looked
around the circle of her relatives,--and there was a little about
her of another twelve-year-old Child who stood in the midst of
his elders in Temple,--"maybe she was doing that . . . then."</p>
