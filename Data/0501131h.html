    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was nearly a year since her husband's death,
      Emmeline Lucas (universally known to her friends as Lucia)
      still wore the deepest and most uncompromising mourning.
      Black certainly suited her very well, but that had nothing
      to do with this continued use of it, whatever anybody said.
      Pepino and she had been the most devoted couple for over
      twenty-five years, and her grief at his loss was
      heart-felt: she missed him constantly and keenly. But
      months ago now, she, with her very vital and active
      personality, had felt a most natural craving to immerse
      herself again in all those thrilling interests which made
      life at this Elizabethan village of Riseholme so exciting a
      business, and she had not yet been able to make up her mind
      to take the plunge she longed for. Though she had not made
      a luxury out of the tokens of grief, she had perhaps made,
      ever so slightly, a stunt of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance. There was that book-shop on the green, 'Ye
      Signe of ye Daffodille', under the imprint of which Pepino
      had published his severely limited edition of <i>Fugitive
      Lyrics</i> and <i>Pensieri Persi.</i> A full six months
      after his death Lucia had been walking past it with Georgie
      Pillson, and had seen in the window a book she would have
      liked to purchase. But next to it, on the shelf, was the
      thin volume of Pepino's <i>Pensieri Persi,</i> and,
      frankly, it had been rather stuntish of her to falter on
      the threshold and, with eyes that were doing their best to
      swim, to say to Georgie:
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't quite face going in, Georgie. Weak of me, I know,
      but there it is. Will you please just pop in, caro, and ask
      them to send me <i>Beethoven's Days of Boyhood?</i> I will
      stroll on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Georgie had pressed her hand and done this errand for
      her, and of course he had repeated this pathetic little
      incident to others. Tasteful embroideries had been tacked
      on to it, and it was soon known all over Riseholme that
      poor Lucia had gone into 'Ye Signe of ye Daffodille' to buy
      the book about Beethoven's boyhood, and had been so sadly
      affected by the sight of Pepino's poems in their rough
      brown linen cover with dark-green tape to tie them up with
      (although she constantly saw the same volume in her own
      house), that she had quite broken down. Some said that sal
      volatile had been administered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, she had never been able to bring herself to have
      a game of golf, or to resume her Dante-readings, and having
      thus established the impression that her life had been
      completely smashed up it had been hard to decide that on
      Tuesday or Wednesday next she would begin to glue it
      together again. In consequence she had remained in as many
      pieces as before. Like a sensible woman she was very
      careful of her physical health, and since this stunt of
      mourning made it impossible for her to play golf or take
      brisk walks, she sent for a very illuminating little book,
      called <i>An Ideal System of Callisthenics for those no
      longer Young,</i> and in a secluded glade of her garden she
      exposed as much of herself as was proper to the
      invigorating action of the sun, when there was any, and had
      long bouts of skipping, and kicked, and jerked, and swayed
      her trunk, gracefully and vigorously, in accordance with
      the instructions laid down. The effect was most
      satisfactory, and at the very, very back of her mind she
      conceived it possible that some day she might conduct
      callisthenic classes for those ladies of Riseholme who were
      no longer young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the greater matter of the Elizabethan fête
      to be held in August next, when Riseholme would be swarming
      with tourists. The idea of it had been entirely Lucia's,
      and there had been several meetings of the fête-committee
      (of which, naturally, she was President) before Pepino's
      death. She had planned the great scene in it: this was to
      be Queen Elizabeth's visit to the <i>Golden Hind,</i> when,
      on the completion of Francis Drake's circumnavigation of
      the world, Her Majesty went to dine with him on board his
      ship at Deptford and knighted him. The <i>Golden Hind</i>
      was to be moored in the pond on the village green; or, more
      accurately, a platform on piles was to be built there, in
      the shape of a ship's deck, with masts and rudder and
      cannons and bulwarks, and banners and ancients,
      particularly ancients. The pond would be an admirable
      stage, for rows of benches would be put up all round it,
      and everybody would see beautifully. The Queen's procession
      with trumpeters and men-at-arms and ladies of the Court was
      planned to start from the Hurst, which was Lucia's house,
      and make its glittering and melodious way across the green
      to Deptford to the sound of madrigals and medieval marches.
      Lucia would impersonate the Queen, Pepino following her as
      Raleigh, and Georgie would be Francis Drake. But at an
      early stage of these incubations Pepino had died, and Lucia
      had involved herself in this inextricable widowhood. Since
      then the reins of government had fallen into Daisy
      Quantock's podgy little hands, and she, in this as in all
      other matters, had come to consider herself quite the Queen
      of Riseholme, until Lucia could get a move on again and
      teach her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning in June, some seven weeks before the date fixed
      for the fête, Mrs Quantock telephoned from her house a
      hundred yards away to say that she particularly wanted to
      see Lucia, if she might pop over for a little talk. Lucia
      had heard nothing lately about the preparations for the
      fête, for the last time that it had been mentioned in her
      presence, she had gulped and sat with her hand over her
      eyes for a moment overcome with the memory of how gaily she
      had planned it. But she knew that the preparations for it
      must by this time be well in hand, and now she instantly
      guessed that it was on this subject that Daisy wanted to
      see her. She had premonitions of that kind sometimes, and
      she was sure that this was one of them. Probably Daisy
      wanted to address a moving appeal to her that, for the sake
      of Riseholme generally, she should make this fête the
      occasion of her emerging from her hermetic widowhood. The
      idea recommended itself to Lucia, for before the date fixed
      for it, she would have been a widow for over a year, and
      she reflected that her dear Pepino would never have wished
      her to make this permanent suttee of herself: also there
      was the prestige of Riseholme to be considered. Besides,
      she was really itching to get back into the saddle again,
      and depose Daisy from her awkward, clumsy seat there, and
      this would be an admirable opportunity. So, as was usual
      now with her, she first sighed into the telephone, said
      rather faintly that she would be delighted to see dear
      Daisy, and then sighed again. Daisy, very stupidly, hoped
      she had not got a cough, and was reassured on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a few moments' thought as to whether she would
      be found at the piano, playing the funeral march from
      Beethoven's Sonata in A flat which she now knew by heart,
      or be sitting out in Perdita's garden, reading Pepino's
      poems. She decided on the latter, and putting on a shady
      straw hat with a crêpe bow on it, and taking a copy of the
      poems from the shelf, hurried out into Perdita's garden.
      She also carried with her a copy of to-day's <i>Times,</i>
      which she had not yet read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perdita's garden requires a few words of explanation. It
      was a charming little square plot in front of the timbered
      façade of the Hurst, surrounded by yew-hedges and
      intersected with paths of crazy pavement, carefully
      smothered in stone-crop, which led to the Elizabethan
      sundial from Wardour Street in the centre. It was gay in
      spring with those flowers (and no others) on which Perdita
      doted. There were 'violets dim', and primroses and
      daffodils, which came before the swallow dared and took the
      winds (usually of April) with beauty. But now in June the
      swallow had dared long ago, and when spring and the
      daffodils were over, Lucia always allowed Perdita's garden
      a wider, though still strictly Shakespearian scope. There
      was eglantine (Penzance briar) in full flower now, and
      honeysuckle and gillyflowers and plenty of pansies for
      thoughts, and yards of rue (more than usual this year), and
      so Perdita's garden was gay all the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then, this morning, Lucia seated herself by the
      sundial, all in black, on a stone bench on which was carved
      the motto 'Come thou north wind, and blow thou south, that
      my garden spices may flow forth.' Sitting there with
      Pepino's poems and <i>The Times</i> she obscured about
      one-third of this text, and fat little Daisy would obscure
      the rest . . . It was rather annoying that the tapes which
      tied the covers of Pepino's poems had got into a hard knot,
      which she was quite unable to unravel, for she had meant
      that Daisy should come up, unheard by her, in her
      absorption, and find her reading Pepino's lyric called
      'Loneliness'. But she could not untie the tapes, and as
      soon as she heard Daisy's footsteps she became lost in
      reverie with the book lying shut on her lap, and the famous
      far-away look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very hot morning. Daisy, like many middle-aged
      women who enjoyed perfect health, was always practising
      some medical regime of a hygienic nature, and just now she
      was a devoted slave to the eliminative processes of the
      body. The pores of the skin were the most important of
      these agencies, and, after her drill of physical jerks by
      the open window of her bedroom, she had trotted in all this
      heat across the green to keep up the elimination. She
      mopped and panted for a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Made quite a new woman of me,' she said. 'You should try
      it, dear Lucia. But so good of you to see me, and I'll come
      to the point at once. The Elizabethan fête, you know. You
      see it won't be till August. Can't we persuade you, as they
      say, to come amongst us again? We all want you: such a
      fillip you'd give it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made no doubt that this request implied the hope that
      she might be induced to take the part of Queen Elizabeth,
      and under the spell of the exuberant sunshine that poured
      in upon Perdita's garden, she felt the thrill and the pulse
      of life bound in her veins. The fête would be an admirable
      occasion for entering the arena of activities again, and,
      as Daisy had hinted (delicately for Daisy), more than a
      year of her widowhood would have elapsed by August. It was
      self-sacrificing, too, of Daisy to have suggested this
      herself, for she knew that according to present
      arrangements Daisy was to take the part of the Virgin
      Queen, and Georgie had told her weeks ago (when the subject
      of the fête had been last alluded to) that she was already
      busy pricking her fingers by sewing a ruff to go round her
      fat little neck, and that she had bought a most sumptuous
      string of Woolworth pearls. Perhaps dear Daisy had realized
      what a very ridiculous figure she would present as Queen,
      and was anxious for the sake of the fête to retire from so
      laughable a role. But, however that might be, it was nice
      of her to volunteer abdication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt that it was only proper that Daisy should press
      her a little. She was being asked to sacrifice her personal
      feelings which so recoiled from publicity, and for the sake
      of Riseholme to rescue the fête from being a farce. She was
      most eager to do so, and a very little pressing would be
      sufficient. So she sighed again, she stroked the cover of
      Pepino's poems, but she spoke quite briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Daisy,' she said, 'I don't think I could face it. I
      cannot imagine myself coming out of my house in silks and
      jewels to take my place in the procession without my
      Pepino. He was to have been Raleigh, you remember, and to
      have walked immediately behind me. The welcome, the
      shouting, the rejoicing, the madrigals, the Morris-dances
      and me with my poor desolate heart! But perhaps I ought to
      make an effort. My dear Pepino, I know, would have wished
      me to. You think so, too, and I have always respected the
      soundness of your judgment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight change came over Daisy's round red face. Lucia was
      getting on rather too fast and too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, none of us ever thought of asking you to be Queen
      Elizabeth,' she said. 'We are not so unsympathetic, for of
      course that would be far too great a strain on you. You
      must not think of it. All that I was going to suggest was
      that you might take the part of Drake's wife. She only
      comes forward just for a moment, and makes her curtsey to
      me--I mean to the Queen--and then walks backwards again
      into the chorus of ladies-in-waiting and halberdiers and
      things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's beady eyes dwelt for a moment on Daisy's rather
      anxious face with a glance of singular disdain. What a fool
      poor Daisy was to think that she, Lucia, could possibly
      consent to take any subordinate part in tableaux or
      processions or anything else at Riseholme where she had
      been Queen so long! She had decided in her own mind that
      with a very little judicious pressing she would take the
      part of the Queen, and thus make her superb entry into
      Riseholme life again, but all the pressure in the world
      would not induce her to impersonate anyone else, unless she
      could double it with the Queen. Was there ever anything so
      tactless as Daisy's tact? . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a wintry smile, and stroked the cover of Pepino's
      poems again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet of you to suggest it, dear,' she said, 'but indeed
      it would be quite too much for me. I was wrong to entertain
      the idea even for a moment. Naturally I shall take the
      greatest, the <i>very</i> greatest interest in it all, and
      I am sure you will understand if I do not even feel equal
      to coming to it, and read about it instead in the
      <i>Worcestershire Herald.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Perhaps it would be more in keeping with her
      empty heart to say nothing more about the fête. On the
      other hand, she felt a devouring curiosity to know how they
      were getting on. She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must begin to interest myself in things again,' she
      said. 'So tell me about it all, Daisy, if you would like
      to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was much relieved to know that even the part of
      Drake's wife was too much for Lucia. She was safe now from
      any risk of having the far more arduous part of the Queen
      snatched from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All going splendidly,' she said. 'Revels on the green to
      open with, and madrigals and Morris-dances. Then comes the
      scene on the <i>Golden Hind</i> which was entirely your
      idea. We've only elaborated it a little. There will be a
      fire on the poop of the ship, or is it the prow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It depends, dear, which end of the ship you mean,' said
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The behind part, the stern. Poop, is it? Well, there will
      be a fire on the poop for cooking. Quite safe, they say, if
      the logs are laid on a sheet of iron. Over the fire we
      shall have an Elizabethan spit, and roast a sheep on it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't,' said Lucia, feeling the glamour of these
      schemes glowing in her. 'Half of it will be cinders and the
      rest blood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, dear,' said Daisy. 'It will really be roasted first at
      the Ambermere Arms, and then just hung over the fire on the
      <i>Golden Hind.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes: just to get a little kippered in the smoke,' said
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to matter. Of course I shan't really eat any, because
      I never touch meat of any sort now: I shall only pretend
      to. But there'll be the scene of cooking going on for the
      Queen's dinner on the deck of the <i>Golden Hind,</i> just
      to fill up, while the Queen's procession is forming. Oh, I
      wonder if you would let us start the procession from your
      house rather than mine. The route would be so much more in
      the open: everyone will see it better. I would come across
      to dress, if you would let me, half an hour before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia of course knew perfectly well that Daisy was to be
      the Queen, but she wanted to make her say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly start from here,' said Lucia. 'I am only too
      happy to help. And dress here yourself. Let me see: what
      are you going to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They've all insisted that I should be Queen Elizabeth,'
      said Daisy hurriedly. 'Where had we got to? Oh yes: as the
      procession is forming, the cooking will be going on. Songs
      of course, a chorus of cooks. Then the procession will
      cross the green to the <i>Golden Hind,</i> then dinner, and
      then I knight Drake. Such a lovely sword. Then Elizabethan
      games, running, jumping, wrestling and so on. We thought of
      baiting a bear, one out of some menagerie that could be
      trusted not to get angry, but we've given that up. If it
      didn't get angry, it wouldn't be baited, and if it did get
      angry it would be awful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very prudent,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I steal away into the Ambermere Arms which is quite
      close, and change into a riding-dress. There'll be a white
      palfrey at the door, the one that draws the milk-cart. Oh,
      I forgot. While I'm dressing, before the palfrey comes
      round, a rider gallops in from Plymouth on a horse covered
      with soapsuds to say that the Spanish Armada has been
      sighted. I think we must have a megaphone for that, or no
      one will hear. So I come out, and mount my palfrey, and
      make my speech to my troops at Tilbury. A large board, you
      know, with Tilbury written up on it like a station. That's
      quite in the Shakespearian style. I shall have to learn it
      all by heart, and just have Raleigh standing by the palfrey
      with a copy of my speech to prompt me if I forget.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old familiar glamour glowed brighter and brighter to
      Lucia as Daisy spoke. She wondered if she had made a
      mistake in not accepting the ludicrous part of Drake's
      wife, just in order to get a footing in these affairs again
      and attend committees, and, gradually ousting Daisy from
      her supremacy, take the part of the Queen herself. She felt
      that she must think it all over, and settle whether, in so
      advanced a stage of the proceedings, it could be done. At
      present, till she had made up her mind, it was wiser, in
      order to rouse no suspicions, to pretend that these things
      were all very remote. She would take a faint though kindly
      interest in them, as if some elderly person was watching
      children at play, and smiling pensively at their pretty
      gambols. But as for watching the fête when the date
      arrived, that was unthinkable. She would either be Queen
      Elizabeth herself, or not be at Riseholme at all. That was
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you have got your work cut out for you, dear Daisy,'
      she said, giving a surreptitious tug at the knotted tape of
      Pepino's poems. 'What fun you will have, and, dear me, how
      far away it all seems!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy wrenched her mind away from the thought of the fête.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It won't always, dear,' she said, making a sympathetic
      little dab at Lucia's wrist. 'Your joy in life will revive
      again. I see you've got Pepino's poems there. Won't you
      read me one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia responded to this gesture with another dab.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you remember the last one he wrote?' she said. 'He
      called it "Loneliness". I was away in London at the time.
      Beginning:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The spavined storm-clouds limp down the ruinous sky,<br>
           While I sit alone.<br>
      Thick through the acid air the dumb leaves fly . . .<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But I won't read it you now. Another time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy gave one more sympathetic poke at her wrist, and rose
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Must be off,' she said. 'Won't you come round and dine
      quietly to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't, many thanks. Georgie is dining with me. Any news
      in Riseholme this morning?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes,' she said. 'Mrs Antrobus's got a wonderful new
      apparatus. Not an ear-trumpet at all. She just bites on a
      small leather pad, and hears everything perfectly. Then she
      takes it out of her mouth and answers you, and puts it back
      again to listen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Lucia excitedly. 'All wet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite dry. Just between her teeth. No wetter anyhow than a
      pen you put in your mouth, I assure you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy hurried away to do some more exercises and drink
      pints and pints of hot water before lunch. She felt that
      she had emerged safely from a situation which might easily
      have become menacing, for without question Lucia, in spite
      of her sighs and her wistful stroking of the covers of
      Pepino's poems, and her great crêpe bow, was beginning to
      show signs of her old animation. She had given Daisy a
      glance or two from that beady eye which had the qualities
      of a gimlet about it, she had shown eager interest in such
      topics as the roasting of the sheep and Mrs Antrobus's
      gadget, which a few weeks ago would not have aroused the
      slightest response from her stricken mind, and it was
      lucky, Daisy thought, that Lucia had given her the definite
      assurance that even the part of Drake's wife in the fête
      would be too much for her. For goodness only knew, when
      once Lucia settled to be on the mend, how swift her
      recuperation might be, or what mental horse-power in the
      way of schemings and domination she might not develop after
      this fallow period of quiescence. There was a new
      atmosphere about her to-day: she was like some spring
      morning when, though winds might still be chilly and the
      sun still of tepid and watery beams, the air was pregnant
      with the imminent birth of new life. But evidently she
      meant to take no hand in the fête, which at present
      completely filled Daisy's horizon. 'She may do what she
      likes afterwards,' thought Daisy, breaking into a trot,
      'but I will be Queen Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her house, with its mulberry-tree in front and its garden
      at the back, stood next Georgie Pillson's on the edge of
      the green, and as she passed through it and out on to the
      lawn behind, she heard from the other side of the paling
      that tap-tap of croquet-mallet and ball which now almost
      without cessation punctuated the hours of any fine morning.
      Georgie had developed a craze for solitary croquet: he
      spent half the day practising all by himself, to the great
      neglect of his water-colour painting and his piano-playing.
      He seemed indeed, apart from croquet, to be losing his zest
      for life; he took none of his old interest in the thrilling
      topics of Riseholme. He had not been a bit excited at
      Daisy's description of Mrs Antrobus's new apparatus, and
      the prospect of impersonating Francis Drake at the
      forthcoming fête aroused only the most tepid enthusiasm in
      him. A book of Elizabethan costumes, full of sumptuous
      coloured plates, had roused him for a while from his
      lethargy, and he had chosen a white satin tunic with puffed
      sleeves slashed with crimson, and a cloak of rose-coloured
      silk, on the reproduction of which his peerless parlourmaid
      Foljambe was at work, but he didn't seem to have any
      keenness about him. Of course he had had some rather cruel
      blows of Fate to contend against lately: Miss Olga Bracely
      the prima donna to whom he had been so devoted had left
      Riseholme a month ago for a year's operatic tour in the
      United States and Australia, and that was a desolate
      bereavement for him, while Lucia's determination not to do
      any of all these things which she had once enjoyed so much
      had deprived him of all the duets they used to play
      together. Moreover, it was believed in Riseholme (though
      only whispered at present) that Foljambe, that paragon of
      parlourmaids, in whom the smoothness and comfort of his
      domestic life was centred, was walking out with Cadman,
      Lucia's chauffeur. It might not mean anything, but if it
      did, if Foljambe and he intended to get married and
      Foljambe left Georgie, and if Georgie had got wind of this,
      then indeed there would be good cause for that lack of
      zest, that air of gloom and apprehension which was now so
      often noticeable in him. All these causes, the blows Fate
      had already rained on him, and the anxiety concerning this
      possible catastrophe in the future, probably contributed to
      the eclipsed condition of his energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy sat down on a garden-bench, and began to do a little
      deep-breathing, which was a relic of the days when she had
      studied Yoga. It was important to concentrate (otherwise
      the deep-breathing did no good at all), or rather to attain
      a complete blankness of mind and exclude from it all
      mundane interests which were Maya, or illusion. But this
      morning she found it difficult: regiments of topics grew up
      like mushrooms. Now she congratulated herself on having
      made certain that Lucia was not intending to butt into the
      fête, now she began to have doubts--these were
      disconcerting mushrooms--as to whether that was so certain,
      for Lucia was much brisker to-day than she had been since
      Pepino's death, and if that continued, her reawakened
      interest in life would surely seek for some outlet. Then
      the thought of her own speech to her troops at Tilbury
      began to leak into her mind: would she ever get it so
      thoroughly by heart that she could feel sure that no attack
      of nervousness or movement on the part of her palfrey would
      put it out of her head? Above all there was that disturbing
      tap-tap going on from Georgie's garden, and however much
      she tried to attain blankness of mind, she found herself
      listening for the next tap . . . It was no use and she got
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, are you there?' she called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' came his voice, trembling with excitement. 'Wait a
      minute. I've gone through nine hoops and--Oh, how tarsome,
      I missed quite an easy one. What is it? I rather wish you
      hadn't called me just then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was tall, and he could look over the paling. Daisy
      pulled her chair up to it, and mounted on it, so that they
      could converse with level heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So sorry, Georgie,' she said, 'I didn't know you were
      making such a break. Fancy! Nine! I wanted to tell you I've
      been to see Lucia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that all? I knew that because I saw you,' said Georgie.
      'I was polishing my bibelots in the drawing-room. And you
      sat in Perdita's garden.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And there's a change,' continued Daisy, who had kept her
      mouth open, in order to go on again as soon as Georgie
      stopped. 'She's better. Distinctly. More interested, and
      not so faint and die-away. Sarcastic about the roast sheep
      for instance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What? Did she talk about the fête again?' asked Georgie.
      'That is an improvement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was what I went to talk about. I asked her if she
      wouldn't make an effort to be Drake's wife. But she said it
      would be too great a strain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, you didn't ask her to be Drake's wife?' said
      Georgie incredulously. 'You might as well have asked her to
      be a confused noise within. What can you have been thinking
      of?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyhow, she said she couldn't be anything at all,' said
      Daisy. 'I have her word for that. But if she is recovering,
      and I'm sure she is, her head will be full of plans again.
      I'm not quite happy about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What you mean is that you're afraid she may want to be the
      Queen,' observed Georgie acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't give it up,' said Daisy very firmly, not troubling
      to confirm so obvious an interpretation. 'I've had all the
      trouble of it, and very nearly learnt the speech to the
      troops, and made my ruff and bought a rope of pearls. It
      wouldn't be fair, Georgie. So don't encourage her, will
      you? I know you're dining with her to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I won't encourage her,' said he. 'But you know what
      Lucia is, when she's in working order. If she wants a
      thing, she gets it somehow. It happens. That's all you can
      say about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, this one shan't happen,' said Daisy, dismounting
      from her basket-chair which was beginning to sag. 'It would
      be too mean. And I wish you would come across now and let
      us practise that scene where I knight you. We must get it
      very slick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not this morning,' said Georgie. 'I know my bit: I've only
      got to kneel down. You can practise on the end of a sofa.
      Besides, if Lucia is really waking up, I shall take some
      duets across this evening, and I must have a go at some of
      them. I've not touched my piano for weeks. And my
      shoulder's sore where you knighted me so hard the other
      day. Quite a bruise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy suddenly remembered something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Lucia repeated me several lines out of one of Pepino's
      last poems,' she said. 'She couldn't possibly have done
      that a month ago without breaking down. And I believe she
      would have read one to me when I asked her to, but I'm
      pretty sure she couldn't undo one of those tapes that the
      book is tied up with. A hard knot. She was picking at it .
      . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, she must be better,' said he. 'Ever so much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Georgie went in to practise some of the old duets in
      case Lucia felt equal to evoking the memories of happier
      days at the piano, and Daisy hit the end of her sofa some
      half-dozen times with her umbrella bidding it rise Sir
      Francis Drake. She still wondered if Lucia had some foul
      scheme in her head, but though there had ticked by some
      minutes, directly after their talk in Perdita's garden,
      which might have proved exceedingly dangerous to her own
      chance of being the Queen, these, by the time that she was
      knighting the sofa, had passed. For Lucia, still meditating
      whether she should not lay plots for ousting Daisy, had, in
      default of getting that knotted tape undone, turned to her
      unread <i>Times,</i> and scanned its columns with a rather
      absent eye. There was no news that could interest anybody,
      and her glance wandered up and down the lists of situations
      vacant and wanted, of the sailings of steamers, and finally
      of houses to be let for summer months. There was a picture
      of one with a plain pleasant Queen Anne front looking on to
      a cobbled street. It was highly attractive, and below it
      she read that Miss Mapp sought a tenant for her house in
      Tilling, called Mallards, for the months of August and
      September. Seven bedrooms, four sitting-rooms, h. &amp; c.
      and an old-world garden. At that precise psychological
      moment Daisy's prospects of being Queen Elizabeth became
      vastly rosier, for this house to let started an idea in
      Lucia's mind which instantly took precedence of other
      schemes. She must talk to Georgie about it this evening:
      till then it should simmer. Surely also the name of Miss
      Mapp aroused faint echoes of memory in her mind: she seemed
      to remember a large woman with a wide smile who had stayed
      at the Ambermere Arms a few years ago, and had been very
      agreeable but slightly superior. Georgie would probably
      remember her . . . But the sun had become extremely
      powerful, and Lucia picked up her <i>Times</i> and her book
      of poems and went indoors to the cool lattice-paned parlour
      where her piano stood. By it was a book-case with volumes
      of bound-up music, and she drew from it one which contained
      the duets over which Georgie and she used to be so gay and
      so industrious. These were Mozart quartettes arranged for
      four hands, delicious, rippling airs: it was months since
      she had touched them, or since the music-room had resounded
      to anything but the most sombre and pensive strains. Now
      she opened the book and put it on the music-rest. <i>'Uno,
      due, tre,'</i> she said to herself and began practising the
      treble part which was the more amusing to play.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie saw the difference in her at once when he arrived
      for dinner that evening. She was sitting outside in
      Perdita's garden and for the first time hailed him as of
      old in brilliant Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Buona sera, caro,'</i> she said. '<i>Come sta?'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'Molto bene,' he answered, 'and what a <i>caldo</i> day.
      I've brought a little music across with me in case you felt
      inclined. Mozartino.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a good idea! We will have <i>un po</i>' <i>di
      musica</i> afterwards, but I've got <i>tanto, tanto</i> to
      talk to you about. Come in: dinner will be ready. Any
      news?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me think,' he said. 'No, I don't think there's much.
      I've got rather a bruised shoulder where Daisy knighted me
      the other day--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Daisy!' said Lucia. 'A little heavy-handed sometimes,
      don't you find? Not a light touch. She was in here this
      morning talking about the fête. She urged me to take part
      in it. What part do you think she suggested, Georgie?
      You'll never guess.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never should have, if she hadn't told me,' he said. 'The
      most ludicrous thing I ever heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm afraid not much more ludicrous than her being Queen
      Elizabeth,' she said. 'Daisy on a palfrey addressing her
      troops! Georgie dear, think of it! It sounds like that
      rather vulgar game called "Consequences". Daisy, I am
      afraid, has got tipsy with excitement at the thought of
      being a queen. She is running amok, and she will make a
      deplorable exhibition of herself, and Riseholme will become
      the laughing-stock of all those American tourists who come
      here in August to see our lovely Elizabethan village. The
      Village will be all right, but what of Elizabeth? <i>Tacete
      un momento,</i> Georgie. <i>Le domestiche?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's Italian was rusty after so much disuse, but he
      managed to translate this sentence to himself, and
      unerringly inferred that Lucia did not want to pursue the
      subject while Grosvenor, the parlourmaid, and her colleague
      were in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Sicuro,'</i> he said, and made haste to help himself to
      his fish. The <i>domestiche</i> thereupon left the room
      again, to be summoned back by the stroke of a silver bell
      in the shape of a pomander which nestled among pepper- and
      mustard-pots beside Lucia. Almost before the door had
      closed on their exit, Lucia began to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course after poor Daisy's suggestion I shall take no
      part myself in this fête,' she said; 'and even if she
      besought me on her knees to play Queen Elizabeth, I could
      not dream of doing so. She cannot deprive me of what I may
      call a proper pride, and since she has thought good to
      offer me the role of Drake's wife, who, she hastened to
      explain, only came on for one moment and curtsied to her,
      and then retired into the ranks of men-at-arms and
      ladies-in-waiting again, my sense of dignity, of which I
      have still some small fragments left, would naturally
      prevent me from taking any part in the performance, even at
      the end of a barge-pole. But I am sorry for Daisy, since
      she knows her own deficiencies so little, and I shall mourn
      for Riseholme if the poor thing makes such a mess of the
      whole affair as she most indubitably will if she is left to
      organize it herself. That's all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, however, that there was a little more, for
      Lucia quickly finished her fish, and continued at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So after what she said to me this morning, I cannot myself
      offer to help her, but if you like to do so, Georgie, you
      can tell her--not from me, mind, but from your own
      impression--that you think I should be perfectly willing to
      coach her and make the best I can of her as the embodiment
      of great Queen Bess. Something might be done with her. She
      is short, but so was the Queen. She has rather bad teeth,
      but that doesn't matter, for the Queen had the same. Again
      she is not quite a lady, but the Queen also had a marked
      strain of vulgarity and bourgeoisie. There was a coarse
      fibre in the Tudors, as I have always maintained. All this,
      dear Georgie, is to the good. If dear Daisy will only not
      try to look tall, and if she will smile a good deal, and
      behave naturally, these are advantages, real advantages.
      But in spite of them Daisy will merely make herself and
      Riseholme silly if she does not manage to get hold of some
      semblance of dignity and queenship. Little gestures, little
      turnings of the head, little graciousnesses; all that
      acting means. I thought it out in those dear old days when
      we began to plan it, and, as I say, I shall be happy to
      give poor Daisy all the hints I can, if she will come and
      ask me to do so. But mind, Georgie, the suggestion must not
      come from me. You are at liberty to say that you think I
      possibly might help her, but nothing more than that.
      <i>Capite?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Italian word, not understanded of the people, came
      rather late, for already Lucia had struck the bell, as,
      unconsciously, she was emphasizing her generous proposal,
      and Grosvenor and her satellite had been in the room quite
      a long time. Concealment from <i>le domestiche</i> was
      therefore no longer possible. In fact both Georgie and
      Lucia had forgotten about the <i>domestiche</i> altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's most kind of you, Lucia,' said Georgie. 'But you
      know what Daisy is. As obstinate as--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As a palfrey,' interrupted Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, quite. Certainly I'll tell her what you say, or
      rather suggest what you might say if she asked you to coach
      her, but I don't believe it will be any use. The whole fête
      has become an awful bore. There are six weeks yet before
      it's held, and she wants to practise knighting me every
      day, and has processions up and down her garden, and she
      gets all the tradesmen in the place to walk before her as
      halberdiers and sea-captains, when they ought to be
      attending to their businesses and chopping meat and milking
      cows. Everyone's sick of it. I wish you would take it over,
      and be Queen yourself. Oh, I forgot, I promised Daisy I
      wouldn't encourage you. Dear me, how awful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed, positively laughed. This was an enormous
      improvement on the pensive smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not awful at all, <i>Georgino mio,'</i> she said. 'I can
      well imagine poor Daisy's feverish fear that I should try
      to save her from being ridiculous. She loves being
      ridiculous, dear thing; it's a complex with her--that
      wonderful new book of Freud's which I must read--and
      subconsciously she pines to be ridiculous on as large a
      scale as possible. But as for my taking it over, that's
      quite out of the question. To begin with, I don't suppose I
      shall be here. Twelfth of August isn't it? Grouse-shooting
      opens in Scotland and bear-baiting at Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, that was given up,' said Georgie. 'I opposed it
      throughout on the committee. I said that even if we could
      get a bear at all, it wouldn't be baited if it didn't get
      angry--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that if it did get angry it would be awful,' she put
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. How did you know I said that?' asked Georgie. 'Rather
      neat, wasn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very neat indeed, <i>caro,'</i> said she. 'I knew you said
      it because Daisy told me she had said it herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a cheat!' said Georgie indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked at him wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you mustn't think hardly of poor dear Daisy,' she
      said. 'Cheat is too strong a word. Just a little envious,
      perhaps, of bright clever things that other people say, not
      being very quick herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyhow, I shall tell her that I know she has bagged my
      joke,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, not worth while. You'll make quantities of
      others. All so trivial, Georgie, not worth noticing.
      Beneath you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia leaned forward with her elbows on the table, quite in
      the old braced way, instead of drooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we've got far more important things to talk about than
      Daisy's little pilferings,' she said. 'Where shall I
      begin?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From the beginning,' said Georgie greedily. He had not
      felt so keen about the affairs of daily life since Lucia
      had buried herself in her bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the real beginning was this morning,' she said,
      'when I saw something in <i>The Times.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'More than I did,' said Georgie. 'Was it about Riseholme or
      the fête? Daisy said she was going to write a letter to
      <i>The Times</i> about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must have missed that,' said Lucia, 'unless by any
      chance they didn't put it in. No, not about the fête, nor
      about Riseholme. Very much not about Riseholme. Georgie, do
      you remember a woman who stayed at the Ambermere Arms one
      summer called Miss Mapp?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie concentrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remember the name, because she was rather globular, like
      a map of the world,' he said. 'Oh, wait a moment:
      something's coming back to me. Large, with a great smile.
      Teeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that's the one,' cried Lucia. 'There's telepathy
      going on, Georgie. We're suggesting to each other . . .
      Rather like a hyena, a handsome hyena. Not hungry now but
      might be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And talked about a place called Tilling, where she
      had a Queen Anne house. We rather despised her for that.
      Oh, yes, and she came to a garden-party of mine. And I know
      when it was too. It was that summer when you invented
      saying "Au reservoir" instead <i>of "Au revoir".</i> We all
      said it for about a week and then got tired of it. Miss
      Mapp came here just about then, because she picked it up at
      my garden-party. She stopped quite to the end, eating
      quantities of red-currant fool, and saying that she had
      inherited a recipe from her grandmother which she would
      send me. She did, too, and my cook said it was rubbish.
      Yes: it was the au reservoir year, because she said au
      reservoir to everyone as they left, and told me she would
      take it back to Tilling. That's the one. Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, your memory's marvellous,' said Lucia. 'Now about
      the advertisement I saw in <i>The Times.</i> Miss Mapp is
      letting her Queen Anne house called Mallards, h. &amp; c.
      and old-world garden, for August and September. I want you
      to drive over with me to-morrow and see it. I think that
      very likely, if it's at all what I hope, I shall take it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' cried Georgie. 'Why of course I'll drive there with
      you to-morrow. What fun! But it will be too awful if you go
      away for two months. What shall I do? First there's Olga
      not coming back for a year, and now you're thinking of
      going away, and there'll be nothing left for me except my
      croquet and being Drake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him one of those glances behind which lurked so
      much purpose, which no doubt would be disclosed at the
      proper time. The bees were astir once more in the hive, and
      presently they would stream out for swarmings or stingings
      or honey-harvesting . . . It was delightful to see her
      looking like that again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, I want change,' she said, 'and though I'm much
      touched at the idea of your missing me, I think I must have
      it. I want to get roused up again and shaken and made to
      tick. Change of air, change of scene, change of people. I
      don't suppose anyone alive has been more immersed than I in
      the spacious days of Elizabeth, or more devoted to
      Shakespearian tradition and environment--perhaps I ought to
      except Sir Sidney Lee, isn't it?--than I, but I want for
      the present anyhow to get away from it, especially when
      poor Daisy is intending to make this deplorable public
      parody of all that I have held sacred so long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia swallowed three or four strawberries as if they had
      been pills and took a gulp of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I could bear to be here for all the
      rehearsals,' she said; 'to look out from the rue and
      honeysuckle of my sweet garden and see her on her palfrey
      addressing her lieges of Riseholme, and making them walk in
      procession in front of her. It did occur to me this morning
      that I might intervene, take the part of the Queen myself,
      and make a pageant such as I had planned in those happy
      days, which would have done honour to the great age and
      credit to Riseholme, but it would spoil the dream of
      Daisy's life, and one must be kind. I wash my hands of it
      all, though of course I shall allow her to dress here, and
      the procession to start from my house. She wanted that, and
      she shall have it, but of course she must state on the
      programmes that the procession starts from Mrs Philip
      Lucas's house. It would be too much that the visitors, if
      there are any, should think that my beautiful Hurst belongs
      to Daisy. And, as I said, I shall be happy to coach her,
      and see if I can do anything with her. But I won't be here
      for the fête, and I must be somewhere and that's why I'm
      thinking of Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had moved into the music-room where the bust of
      Shakespeare stood among its vases of flowers, and the
      picture of Lucia by Tancred Sigismund, looking like a
      chessboard with some arms and legs and eyes sticking out of
      it, hung on the wall. There were Georgie's sketches there,
      and the piano was open, and <i>Beethoven's Days of
      Boyhood</i> was lying on the table with the paper-knife
      stuck between its leaves, and there was animation about the
      room once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia seated herself in the chair that might so easily have
      come from Anne Hathaway's cottage, though there was no
      particular reason for supposing that it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, I am beginning to feel alive again,' she said.
      'Do you remember what wonderful Alfred says in <i>Maud?</i>
      "My life hath crept so long on a broken wing." That's what
      my life has been doing, but now I'm not going to creep any
      more. And just for the time, as I say, I'm "off" the age of
      Elizabeth, partly poor Daisy's fault, no doubt. But there
      were other ages, Georgie, the age of Pericles, for
      instance. Fancy sitting at Socrates's feet or Plato's, and
      hearing them talk while the sun set over Salamis or
      Pentelicus. I must rub up my Greek, Georgie. I used to know
      a little Greek at one time, and if I ever manage any
      tableaux again, we must have the death of Agamemnon. And
      then there's the age of Anne. What a wonderful time, Pope
      and Addison! So civilized, so cultivated. Their routs and
      their tea-parties and rapes of the lock. With all the
      greatness and splendour of the Elizabethan age, there must
      have been a certain coarseness and crudity about them. No
      one reveres it more than I, but it is a mistake to remain
      in the same waters too long. There comes a tide in the
      affairs of men, which, if you don't nip it in the bud,
      leads on to boredom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, is that yours?' said Georgie. 'And absolutely
      impromptu like that! You're too brilliant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not quite impromptu, for Lucia had thought of it in
      her bath. But it would be meticulous to explain that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wicked of me, I'm afraid,' she said. 'But it expresses my
      feelings just now. I do want a change, and my happening to
      see this notice of Miss Mapp's in <i>The Times</i> seems a
      very remarkable coincidence. Almost as if it was sent: what
      they call a leading. Anyhow, you and I will drive over to
      Tilling tomorrow and see it. Let us make a jaunt of it,
      Georgie, for it's a long way, and stay the night at an inn
      there. Then we shall have plenty of time to see the place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather a daring project, and Georgie was not quite
      sure if it was proper. But he knew himself well enough to
      be certain that no passionate impulse of his would cause
      Lucia to regret that she had made so intimate a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That'll be the greatest fun,' he said. 'I shall take my
      painting things. I haven't sketched for weeks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Cattivo ragazzo!'</i> said Lucia. 'What have you been
      doing with yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing. There's been no one to play the piano with, and
      no one, who knows, to show my sketches to. Hours of
      croquet, just killing the time. Being Drake. How that fête
      bores me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Oo poor thing!' said Lucia, using again the baby-talk in
      which she and Georgie used so often to indulge. 'But me's
      back again now, and me will scold 'oo vewy vewy much if 'oo
      does not do your lessons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And me vewy glad to be scolded again,' said Georgie. 'Me
      idle boy! Dear me, how nice it all is!' he exclaimed
      enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on the old oak dresser struck ten, and Lucia
      jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, ten o'clock already,' she cried. 'How time has
      flown. Now I'll write out a telegram to be sent to Miss
      Mapp first thing to-morrow to say we'll get to Tilling in
      the afternoon, to see her house, and then ickle
      <i>musica.</i> There was a Mozart duet we used to play. We
      might wrestle with it again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the book that stood on the piano. Luckily that
      was the very one Georgie had been practising this morning.
      (So too had Lucia.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will be lovely,' he said. 'But you mustn't scold me
      if I play vewy badly. Months since I looked at it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me too,' said Lucia. 'Here we are! Shall I take the
      treble? It's a little easier for my poor fingers. Now:
      <i>Uno, due, tre!</i> Off we go!'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c02"
          id="c02">CHAPTER 2</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at Tilling in the middle of the afternoon,
      entering it from the long level road that ran across the
      reclaimed marshland to the west. Blue was the sky overhead,
      complete with larks and small white clouds; the town lay
      basking in the hot June sunshine, and its narrow streets
      abounded in red-brick houses with tiled roofs, that shouted
      Queen Anne and George I in Lucia's enraptured ears, and
      made Georgie's fingers itch for his sketching-tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie, perfectly enchanting!' exclaimed Lucia. 'I
      declare I feel at home already. Look, there's another
      lovely house. We must just drive to the end of this street,
      and then we'll inquire where Mallards is. The people, too,
      I like their looks. Faces full of interest. It's as if they
      expected us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The car had stopped to allow a dray to turn into the High
      Street from a steep cobbled way leading to the top of the
      hill. On the pavement at the corner was standing quite a
      group of Tillingites: there was a clergyman, there was a
      little round bustling woman dressed in a purple frock
      covered with pink roses which looked as if they were made
      of chintz, there was a large military-looking man with a
      couple of golf-clubs in his hand, and there was a hatless
      girl with hair closely cropped, dressed in a fisherman's
      jersey and knickerbockers, who spat very neatly in the
      roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must ask where the house is,' said Lucia, leaning out
      of the window of her Rolls-Royce. 'I wonder if you would be
      so good as to tell me--'
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It'll be Miss Mapp's house you're seeking,' he said in a
      broad Scotch accent. 'Straight up the street, to yon
      corner, and it's right there is Mistress Mapp's house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The odd-looking girl gave a short hoot of laughter, and
      they all stared at Lucia. The car turned with difficulty
      and danced slowly up the steep narrow street.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, he told me where it was before I asked,' said
      Lucia. 'It must be known in Tilling that I was coming. What
      a strange accent that clergyman had! A little tipsy, do you
      think, or only Scotch? The others too! All most interesting
      and unusual. Gracious, here's an enormous car coming down.
      Can we pass, do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of both cars driving on to the pavement on each
      side of the cobbled roadway, the passage was effected, and
      Lucia caught sight of a large woman inside the other, who
      in spite of the heat of the day wore a magnificent sable
      cloak. A small man with a monocle sat eclipsed by her side.
      Then, with glimpses of more red-brick houses to right and
      left, the car stopped at the top of the street opposite a
      very dignified door. Straight in front where the street
      turned at a right angle, a room with a large bow-window
      faced them; this, though slightly separate from the house,
      seemed to belong to it. Georgie thought he saw a woman's
      face peering out between half-drawn curtains, but it
      whisked itself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, a dream,' whispered Lucia, as they stood on the
      doorstep waiting for their ring to be answered. 'That
      wonderful chimney, do you see, all crooked. The church, the
      cobbles, the grass and dandelions growing in between them .
      . . Oh, is Miss Mapp in? Mrs Lucas. She expects me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had hardly stepped inside, when Miss Mapp came
      hurrying in from a door in the direction of the bow-window
      where Georgie had thought he had seen a face peeping out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Mrs Lucas,' she said. 'No need for introductions,
      which makes it all so happy, for how well I remember you at
      Riseholme, your lovely Riseholme. And Mr Pillson! Your
      wonderful garden-party! All so vivid still. Red-letter
      days! Fancy your having driven all this way to see my
      little cottage! Tea at once, Withers, please. In the
      garden-room. Such a long drive but what a heavenly day for
      it. I got your telegram at breakfast-time this morning. I
      could have clapped my hands for joy at the thought of
      possibly having such a tenant as Mrs Lucas of Riseholme.
      But let us have a cup of tea first. Your chauffeur? Of
      course he will have his tea here, too. Withers: Mrs Lucas's
      chauffeur. Mind you take care of him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp took Lucia's cloak from her, and still keeping up
      an effortless flow of hospitable monologue, led them
      through a small panelled parlour which opened on to the
      garden. A flight of eight steps with a canopy of wistaria
      overhead led to the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My little plot,' said Miss Mapp. 'Very modest, as you see,
      three-quarters of an acre at the most, but well screened.
      My flower-beds: sweet roses, tortoiseshell butterflies.
      Rather a nice clematis. My Little Eden I call it, so small,
      but so well beloved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Enchanting!' said Lucia, looking round the garden before
      mounting the steps up to the garden-room door. There was a
      very green and well-kept lawn, set in bright flower-beds. A
      trellis at one end separated it from a kitchen-garden
      beyond, and round the rest ran high brick walls, over which
      peered the roofs of other houses. In one of these walls was
      cut a curved archway with a della Robbia head above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we just pop across the lawn,' said Miss Mapp,
      pointing to this, 'and peep in there while Withers brings
      our tea? Just to stretch the--the limbs, Mrs Lucas, after
      your long drive. There's a wee little plot beyond there
      which is quite a pet of mine. And here's sweet Puss-Cat
      come to welcome my friends. Lamb! Love-bird!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Love-bird's welcome was to dab rather crossly at the
      caressing hand which its mistress extended, and to trot
      away to ambush itself beneath some fine hollyhocks, where
      it regarded them with singular disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My little secret garden,' continued Miss Mapp as they came
      to the archway. 'When I am in here and shut the door, I
      mustn't be disturbed for anything less than a telegram. A
      rule of the house: I am very strict about it. The tower of
      the church keeping watch, as I always say over my little
      nook, and taking care of me. Otherwise not overlooked at
      all. A little paved walk round it, you see, flower-beds, a
      pocket-handkerchief of a lawn, and in the middle a pillar
      with a bust of good Queen Anne. Picked it up in a shop here
      for a song. One of my lucky days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh Georgie, isn't it too sweet?' cried Lucia. <i>'Un
      giardino segreto. Molto bello!'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp gave a little purr of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How lovely to be able to talk Italian like that,' she
      said. 'So pleased you like my little . . <i>. giardino
      segreto,</i> was it? Now shall we have our tea, for I'm
      sure you want refreshment, and see the house afterwards? Or
      would you prefer a little whisky and soda, Mr Pillson? I
      shan't be shocked. Major Benjy--I should say Major
      Flint--often prefers a small whisky and soda to tea on a
      hot day after his game of golf, when he pops in to see me
      and tell me all about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The intense interest in humankind, so strenuously
      cultivated at Riseholme, obliterated for a moment Lucia's
      appreciation of the secret garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if it was he whom we saw at the corner of the
      High Street,' she said. 'A big soldier-like man, with a
      couple of golf-clubs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How you hit him off in a few words,' said Miss Mapp
      admiringly. 'That can be nobody else but Major Benjy. Going
      off no doubt by the steam-tram (most convenient, lands you
      close to the links) for a round of golf after tea. I told
      him it would be far too hot to play earlier. I said I
      should scold him if he was naughty and played after lunch.
      He served for many years in India. Hindustanee is quite a
      second language to him. Calls <i>"Quai-hai"</i> when he
      wants his breakfast. Volumes of wonderful diaries, which we
      all hope to see published some day. His house is next to
      mine down the street. Lots of tiger-skins. A rather
      impetuous bridge-player: quite wicked sometimes. You play
      bridge of course, Mrs Lucas. Plenty of that in Tilling.
      Some good players.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had strolled back over the lawn to the garden-room
      where Withers was laying tea. It was cool and spacious, one
      window was shaded with the big leaves of a fig-tree,
      through which, unseen, Miss Mapp so often peered out to see
      whether her gardener was idling. Over the big bow-window
      looking on to the street one curtain was half-drawn, a
      grand piano stood near it, book-cases half-lined the walls,
      and above them hung many water-colour sketches of the sort
      that proclaims a domestic origin. Their subjects also
      betrayed them, for there was one of the front of Miss
      Mapp's house, and one of the secret garden, another of the
      crooked chimney, and several of the church tower looking
      over the house-roofs on to Miss Mapp's lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she continued to spray on her visitors a perpetual
      shower of flattering and agreeable trifles, Miss Mapp's
      inner attention was wrestling with the problem of how much
      a week, when it came to the delicate question of terms for
      the rent of her house, she should ask Lucia. The price had
      not been mentioned in her advertisement in <i>The
      Times,</i> and though she had told the local house-agent to
      name twelve guineas a week, Lucia was clearly more than
      delighted with what she had seen already, and it would be a
      senseless Quixotism to let her have the house for twelve,
      if she might, all the time, be willing to pay fifteen.
      Moreover, Miss Mapp (from behind the curtain where Georgie
      had seen her) was aware that Lucia had a Rolls-Royce car,
      so that a few additional guineas a week would probably be
      of no significance to her. Of course, if Lucia was not
      enthusiastic about the house as well as the garden, it
      might be unwise to ask fifteen, for she might think that a
      good deal, and would say something tiresome about letting
      Miss Mapp hear from her when she got safe away back to
      Riseholme, and then it was sure to be a refusal. But if she
      continued to rave and talk Italian about the house when she
      saw over it, fifteen guineas should be the price. And not a
      penny of that should Messrs Woolgar &amp; Pipstow, the
      house-agents, get for commission since Lucia had said
      definitely that she saw the advertisement in <i>The
      Times.</i> That was Miss Mapp's affair: nothing to do with
      Woolgar &amp; Pipstow. Meantime she begged Georgie not to
      look at those water-colours on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Little daubs of my own,' she said, most anxious that this
      should be known. 'I should sink into the ground with shame,
      clear Mr Pillson, if you looked at them, for I know what a
      great artist you are yourself. And Withers has brought us
      our tea . . . You like the one of my little <i>giardino
      segreto?</i> (I must remember that beautiful phrase.) How
      kind of you to say so! Perhaps it isn't quite so bad as the
      others, for the subject inspired me, and it's so important,
      isn't it, to love your subject? Major Benjy likes it too.
      Cream, Mrs Lucas? I see Withers has picked some
      strawberries for us from my little plot. Such a year for
      strawberries! And Major Benjy was chatting with friends
      I'll be bound, when you passed him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, a clergyman,' said Lucia, 'who kindly directed us to
      your house. In fact he seemed to know we were going there
      before I said so, didn't he, Georgie? A broad Scotch
      accent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Padre!' said Miss Mapp. 'It's one of his little ways
      to talk Scotch, though he came from Birmingham. A very good
      bridge-player when he can spare time as he usually can.
      Reverend Kenneth Bartlett. Was there a teeny little thin
      woman with him like a mouse? It would be his wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not thin, at all,' said Lucia thoroughly interested.
      'Quite the other way round: in fact round. A purple coat
      and a skirt covered with pink roses that looked as if they
      were made of chintz.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp nearly choked over her first sip of tea, but just
      saved herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I declare I'm quite frightened of you, Mrs Lucas,' she
      said. 'What an eye you've got. Dear Diva Plaistow, whom
      we're all devoted to. Christened Godiva! Such a handicap!
      And they <i>were</i> chintz roses, which she cut out of an
      old pair of curtains and tacked them on. She's full of
      absurd delicious fancies like that. Keeps us all in fits of
      laughter. Anyone else?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, a girl with no hat and an Eton crop. She was dressed
      in a fisherman's jersey and knickerbockers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp looked pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quaint Irene,' she said. 'Irene Coles. Just a touch of
      unconventionality, which sometimes is very refreshing, but
      can be rather embarrassing. Devoted to her art. She paints
      strange pictures, men and women with no clothes on. One has
      to be careful to knock when one goes to see quaint Irene in
      her studio. But a great original.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then when we turned up out of the High Street,' said
      Georgie eagerly, 'we met another Rolls-Royce. I was afraid
      we shouldn't be able to pass it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So was I,' said Miss Mapp unintentionally betraying the
      fact that she had been watching from the garden-room. 'That
      car is always up and down this street here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A large woman in it,' said Lucia. 'Wrapped in sables on
      this broiling day. A little man beside her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr and Mrs Wyse,' said Miss Mapp. 'Lately married. She was
      Mrs Poppit, MBE. Very worthy, and such a crashing snob.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as tea was over and the inhabitants of Tilling thus
      plucked and roasted, the tour of the house was made. There
      were charming little panelled parlours with big windows
      letting in a flood of air and sunshine and vases of fresh
      flowers on the tables. There was a broad staircase with
      shallow treads, and every moment Lucia became more and more
      enamoured of the plain well-shaped rooms. It all looked so
      white and comfortable, and, for one wanting a change, so
      different from the Hurst with its small latticed windows,
      its steep irregular stairs, its single steps, up or down,
      at the threshold of every room. People of the age of Anne
      seemed to have a much better idea of domestic convenience,
      and Lucia's Italian exclamations grew gratifyingly
      frequent. Into Miss Mapp's own bedroom she went alone with
      the owner, leaving Georgie on the landing outside, for
      delicacy would not permit his looking on the scene where
      Miss Mapp nightly disrobed herself, and the bed where she
      nightly disposed herself. Besides, it would be easier for
      Lucia to ask that important point-blank question of terms,
      and for herself to answer it if they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm charmed with the house,' said Lucia. 'And what
      exactly, how much I mean, for a period of two months--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fifteen guineas a week,' said Miss Mapp without pause.
      'That would include the use of my piano. A sweet instrument
      by Blumenfelt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will take it for August and September,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I'm sure I hope you'll be as pleased with it,' said
      Miss Mapp, 'as I'm sure I shall be with my tenant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright idea struck her, and she smiled more widely than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would not include, of course, the wages of my
      gardener, such a nice steady man,' she said, 'or
      garden-produce. Flowers for the house by all means, but not
      fruit or vegetables.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Lucia, blinded by passion for Mallards,
      Tilling and the Tillingites, would have willingly agreed to
      pay the water-rate as well. If Miss Mapp had guessed that,
      she would certainly have named this unusual condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp, as requested by Lucia, had engaged rooms for her
      and Georgie at a pleasant hostelry near by, called the
      Trader's Arms, and she accompanied them there with Lucia's
      car following, like an empty carriage at a funeral, to see
      that all was ready for them. There must have been some
      misunderstanding of the message, for Georgie found that a
      double bedroom had been provided for them. Luckily Lucia
      had lingered outside with Miss Mapp, looking at the view
      over the marsh, and Georgie with embarrassed blushes
      explained at the bureau that this would not do at all, and
      the palms of his hands got cold and wet until the mistake
      was erased and remedied. Then Miss Mapp left them and they
      went out to wander about the town. But Mallards was the
      magnet for Lucia's enamoured eye, and presently they stole
      back towards it. Many houses apparently were to be let
      furnished in Tilling just now, and Georgie too grew
      infected with the desire to have one. Riseholme would be
      very dismal without Lucia, for the moment the fête was over
      he felt sure that an appalling reaction after the
      excitement would settle on it; he might even miss being
      knighted. He had sketched everything sketchable, there
      would be nobody to play duets with, and the whole place
      would stagnate again until Lucia's return, just as it had
      stagnated during her impenetrable widowhood. Whereas here
      there were innumerable subjects for his brush, and Lucia
      would be installed in Mallards with a Blumenfelt in the
      garden-room, and, as was already obvious, a maelstrom of
      activities whirling in her brain. Major Benjy interested
      her, so did quaint Irene and the Padre, all the group, in
      fact, which had seen them drive up with such pre-knowledge,
      so it seemed, of their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall of Miss Mapp's garden, now known to them from
      inside, ran up to where they now stood, regarding the front
      of Mallards, and Georgie suddenly observed that just beside
      them was the sweetest little gabled cottage with the board
      announcing that it was to be let furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look, Lucia,' he said. 'How perfectly fascinating! If it
      wasn't for that blasted fête, I believe I should be tempted
      to take it, if I could get it for the couple of months when
      you are here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had been waiting just for that. She was intending to
      hint something of the sort before long unless he did, and
      had made up her mind to stand treat for a bottle of
      champagne at dinner, so that when they strolled about again
      afterwards, as she was quite determined to do, Georgie,
      adventurous with wine, might find the light of the late
      sunset glowing on Georgian fronts in the town and on the
      levels of the surrounding country, quite irresistible. But
      how wise to have waited, so that Georgie should make the
      suggestion himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, what a delicious idea!' she said. 'Are you really
      thinking of it? Heavenly for me to have a friend here
      instead of being planted among strangers. And certainly it
      is a darling little house. It doesn't seem to be occupied,
      no smoke from any of the chimneys. I think we might really
      peep in through the windows and get some idea of what it's
      like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to stand on tiptoe to do this, but by shading
      their eyes from the westerly sun they could get a very
      decent idea of the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This must be the dining-room,' said Georgie, peering in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A lovely open fireplace,' said Lucia. 'So cosy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved on sideways like crabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A little hall,' said Lucia. 'Pretty staircase going up out
      of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      More crab-like movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The sitting-room,' said Georgie. 'Quite charming, and if
      you press your nose close you can see out of the other
      window into a tiny garden beyond. The wooden paling must be
      that of your kitchen-garden.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They stepped back into the street to get a better idea of
      the topography, and at this moment Miss Mapp looked out of
      the bow-window of her garden-room and saw them there. She
      was as intensely interested in this as they in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And three bedrooms I should think upstairs,' said Lucia,
      'and two attics above. Heaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall go and see the agent to-morrow morning,' said
      Georgie. 'I can imagine myself being very comfortable
      there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled off into the disused graveyard round the
      church. Lucia turned to have one more look at the front of
      Mallards, and Miss Mapp made a low swift curtsey, remaining
      down so that she disappeared completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About that old fête,' said Georgie, 'I don't want to throw
      Daisy over, because she'll never get another Drake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you can go down there for the week,' said Lucia who
      had thought it all out, 'and come back as soon as it's
      over. You know how to be knighted by now. You needn't go to
      all those endless rehearsals. Georgie, look at that
      wonderful clock on the church.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lovely,' said Georgie absently. 'I told Daisy I simply
      would not be knighted every day. I shall have no shoulder
      left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I think that must be the Town Hall,' said Lucia.
      'Quite right about not being knighted so often. What a
      perfect sketch you could do of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heaps of room for us all in the cottage,' said Georgie. 'I
      hope there's a servants' sitting-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They'll be in and out of Mallards all day,' said Lucia. 'A
      lovely servants' hall there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I can get it, I will,' said Georgie. 'I shall try to
      let my house at Riseholme, though I shall take my bibelots
      away. I've often had applications for it in other years. I
      hope Foljambe will like Tilling. She will make me miserable
      if she doesn't. Tepid water, fluff on my clothes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time to get back to their inn to unpack, but Georgie
      longed for one more look at his cottage, and Lucia for one
      at Mallards. Just as they turned the corner that brought
      them in sight of these there was thrust out of the window
      of Miss Mapp's garden-room a hand that waved a white
      handkerchief. It might have been samite.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, what can that be?' whispered Lucia. 'It must be a
      signal of some sort. Or was it Miss Mapp waving us good
      night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not very likely,' said he. 'Let's wait one second.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly spoken when Miss Coles, followed by the
      breathless Mrs Plaistow hurried up the three steps leading
      to the front door of Mallards and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva and quaint Irene,' said Lucia. 'It must have been a
      signal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might be a coincidence,' said Georgie. To which puerile
      suggestion Lucia felt it was not worth while to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was a signal and one long prearranged, for it
      was a matter of the deepest concern to several householders
      in Tilling, whether Miss Mapp found a tenant for Mallards,
      and she had promised Diva and quaint Irene to wave a
      handkerchief from the window of the garden-room at six
      o'clock precisely, by which hour it was reasonable to
      suppose that her visitors would have left her. These two
      ladies, who would be prowling about the street below, on
      the look-out, would then hasten to hear the best or the
      worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their interest in the business was vivid, for if Miss Mapp
      succeeded in letting Mallards, she had promised to take
      Diva's house, Wasters, for two months at eight guineas a
      week (the house being much smaller) and Diva would take
      Irene's house, Taormina (smaller still) at five guineas a
      week, and Irene would take a four-roomed labourer's cottage
      (unnamed) just outside the town at two guineas a week, and
      the labourer, who, with his family would be harvesting in
      August and hop-picking in September, would live in some
      sort of shanty and pay no rent at all. Thus from top to
      bottom of this ladder of lessors and lessees they all
      scored, for they all received more than they paid, and all
      would enjoy the benefit of a change without the worry and
      expense of travel and hotels. Each of these ladies would
      wake in the morning in an unfamiliar room, would sit in
      unaccustomed chairs, read each other's books (and possibly
      letters), look at each other's pictures, imbibe all the
      stimulus of new surroundings, without the wrench of leaving
      Tilling at all. No true Tillingite was ever really happy
      away from her town; foreigners were very queer
      untrustworthy people, and if you did not like the food it
      was impossible to engage another cook for an hotel of which
      you were not the proprietor. Annually in the summer this
      sort of ladder of house-letting was set up in Tilling and
      was justly popular. But it all depended on a successful
      letting of Mallards, for if Elizabeth Mapp did not let
      Mallards, she would not take Diva's Wasters nor Diva
      Irene's Taormina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva and Irene therefore hurried to the garden-room where
      they would hear their fate; Irene forging on ahead with
      that long masculine stride that easily kept pace with Major
      Benjy's, the short-legged Diva with that twinkle of feet
      that was like the scudding of a thrush over the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Mapp, what luck?' asked Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp waited till Diva had shot in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I shall tease you both,' said she playfully with
      her widest smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, hurry up,' said Irene. 'I know perfectly well from
      your face that you've let it. Otherwise it would be all
      screwed up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp, though there was no question about her being the
      social queen of Tilling, sometimes felt that there were
      ugly Bolshevistic symptoms in the air, when quaint Irene
      spoke to her like that. And Irene had a dreadful gift of
      mimicry, which was a very low weapon, but formidable. It
      was always wise to be polite to mimics.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Patience, a little patience, dear,' said Miss Mapp
      soothingly. 'If you know I've let it, why wait?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I should like a cocktail,' said Irene. 'If you'll
      just send for one, you can go on teasing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I've let it for August and September,' said Miss
      Mapp, preferring to abandon her teasing than give Irene a
      cocktail. 'And I'm lucky in my tenant. I never met a
      sweeter woman than dear Mrs Lucas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank God,' said Diva, drawing up her chair to the still
      uncleared table. 'Give me a cup of tea, Elizabeth. I could
      eat nothing till I knew.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much did you stick her for it?' asked Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Beg your pardon, dear?' asked Miss Mapp, who could not be
      expected to understand such a vulgar expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What price did you screw her up to? What's she got to pay
      you?' said Irene impatiently. 'Damage: dibs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She instantly closed with the price I suggested,' said
      Miss Mapp. 'I'm not sure, quaint one, that anything beyond
      that is what might be called your business.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I disagree about that,' said the quaint one. 'There ought
      to be a sliding-scale. If you've made her pay through the
      nose, Diva ought to make you pay through the nose for her
      house, and I ought to make her pay through the nose for
      mine. Equality, Fraternity, Nosality.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp bubbled with disarming laughter and rang the bell
      for Irene's cocktail, which might stop her pursuing this
      subject, for the sliding-scale of twelve, eight and five
      guineas a week had been the basis of previous calculations.
      Yet if Lucia so willingly consented to pay more, surely
      that was nobody's affair but that of the high contracting
      parties. Irene, soothed by the prospect of her cocktail,
      pursued the dangerous topic no further, but sat down at
      Miss Mapp's piano and picked out God Save the King, with
      one uncertain finger. Her cocktail arrived just as she
      finished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, dear,' said Miss Mapp. 'Sweet music.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cheerio!' said Irene. 'Are you charging Lucas anything
      extra for use of a fine old instrument?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp was goaded into a direct and emphatic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, darling, I am not,' she said, 'as you are so
      interested in matters that don't concern you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, no offence meant,' said Irene. 'Thanks for the
      cocktail. Look in to-morrow between twelve and one at my
      studio, if you want to see far the greater part of a
      well-made man. I'll be off now to cook my supper. Au
      reservoir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp finished the few strawberries that Diva had
      spared and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our dear Irene has a very coarse side to her nature,
      Diva,' she said. 'No harm in her, but just common. Sad!
      Such a contrast to dear Mrs Lucas. So refined: scraps of
      Italian beautifully pronounced. And so delighted with
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ought we to call on her?' asked Diva. 'Widow's mourning,
      you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp considered this. One plan would be that she
      should take Lucia under her wing (provided she was willing
      to go there), another to let it be known in Tilling (if she
      wasn't) that she did not want to be called upon. That would
      set Tilling's back up, for if there was one thing it hated
      it was anything that (in spite of widow's weeds) might be
      interpreted into superiority. Though Lucia would only be
      two months in Tilling, Miss Mapp did not want her to be too
      popular on her own account, independently. She wanted . . .
      she wanted to have Lucia in her pocket, to take her by the
      hand and show her to Tilling, but to be in control. It all
      had to be thought out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll find out when she comes,' she said. 'I'll ask her,
      for indeed I feel quite an old friend already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And who's the man?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Mr Georgie Pillson. He entertained me so charmingly
      when I was at Riseholme for a night or two some years ago.
      They are staying at the Trader's Arms, and off again
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What? Staying there together?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp turned her head slightly aside as if to avoid
      some faint unpleasant smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva dear,' she said. 'Old friends as we are, I should be
      sorry to have a mind like yours. Horrid. You've been
      reading too many novels. If widow's weeds are not a
      sufficient protection against such innuendoes, a baby girl
      in its christening-robe wouldn't be safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gracious me, I made no innuendo,' said the astonished
      Diva. 'I only meant it was rather a daring thing to do. So
      it is. Anything more came from your mind, Elizabeth, not
      mine. I merely ask you not to put it on to me, and then say
      I'm horrid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp smiled her widest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I accept your apology, dear Diva,' she said.
      'Fully, without back-thought of any kind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I haven't apologized and I won't,' cried Diva. 'It's
      for you to do that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To those not acquainted with the usage of the ladies of
      Tilling, such bitter plain-speaking might seem to denote a
      serious friction between old friends. But neither Elizabeth
      nor Diva had any such feeling: they would both have been
      highly surprised if an impartial listener had imagined
      anything so absurd. Such breezes, even if they grew far
      stronger than this, were no more than bracing airs that
      disposed to energy, or exercises to keep the mind fit. No
      malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Another cup of tea, dear?' said Miss Mapp earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was so like her, thought Diva: that was Elizabeth all
      over. When logic and good feeling alike had produced an
      irresistible case against her, she swept it all away, and
      asked you if you would have some more cold tea or cold
      mutton, or whatever it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva gave up. She knew she was no match for her and had
      more tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About our own affairs then,' she said, 'if that's all
      settled--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear: so sweetly so harmoniously,' said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva swallowed a regurgitation of resentment, and went on
      as if she had not been interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--Mrs Lucas takes possession on the first of August,' she
      said. 'That's to say, you would like to get into Wasters
      that day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Early that day, Diva, if you can manage it,' said
      Elizabeth, 'as I want to give my servants time to clean and
      tidy up. I would pop across in the morning, and my servants
      follow later. All so easy to manage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then there's another thing,' said Diva. 'Garden-produce.
      You're leaving yours, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp gave a little trill of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shan't be digging up all my potatoes and stripping the
      beans and the fruit-trees,' she said. 'And I
      thought--correct me if I am wrong--that my eight guineas a
      week for your little house included garden-produce, which
      is all that really concerns you and me. I think we agreed
      as to that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp leaned forward with an air of imparting luscious
      secret information, as that was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva: something thrilling,' she said. 'I happened to be
      glancing out of my window just by chance a few minutes
      before I waved to you, and there were Mrs Lucas and Mr
      Pillson peering, positively peering into the windows of
      Mallards Cottage. I couldn't help wondering if Mr Pillson
      is thinking of taking it. They seemed to be so absorbed in
      it. It is to let, for Isabel Poppit has taken that little
      brown bungalow with no proper plumbing out by the
      golf-links.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thrilling!' said Diva. 'There's a door in the paling
      between that little back-yard at Mallards Cottage and your
      garden. They could unlock it--'
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, for this was a development of the trend of
      ideas for which neither of them had apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But even if Mr Pillson is thinking of taking it, what
      next, Elizabeth?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp bent to kiss the roses in that beautiful vase of
      flowers which she had cut this morning in preparation for
      Lucia's visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing particular, dear,' she said. 'Just one of my
      madcap notions. You and I might take Mallards Cottage
      between us, if it appealed to you. Sweet Isabel is only
      asking four guineas a week for it. If Mr Pillson
      happens--it's only a speculation--to want it, we might ask,
      say, six. So cheap at six.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shan't touch it,' she said. 'What if Mr Pillson doesn't
      want it? A pure speculation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps it would be rather risky,' said Miss Mapp. 'And
      now I come to think of it, possibly, possibly rather
      stealing a march--don't they call it--on my friends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, decidedly,' said Diva. 'No "possibly possibly" about
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp winced for a moment under this smart rap, and
      changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall have little more than a month, then, in my dear
      house,' she said, 'before I'm turned out of it. I must make
      the most of it, and have a quantity of little gaieties for
      you all.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie and Lucia had another long stroll through the town
      after their dinner. The great celestial signs behaved
      admirably; it was as if the spirit of Tilling had arranged
      that sun, moon and stars alike should put forth their
      utmost arts of advertisement on its behalf, for scarcely
      had the fires of sunset ceased to blaze on its red walls
      and roofs and to incarnadine the thin skeins of mist that
      hung over the marsh, than a large punctual moon arose in
      the east and executed the most wonderful nocturnes in black
      and silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a great grey Norman tower keeping watch seaward,
      an Edwardian gate with drum towers looking out landward:
      they found a belvedere platform built out on a steep slope
      to the east of the town, and the odour of the flowering
      hawthorns that grew there was wafted to them as they gazed
      at a lighthouse winking in the distance. In another street
      there stood Elizabethan cottages of brick and timber, very
      picturesque, but of no interest to those who were at home
      in Riseholme. Then there were human interests as well:
      quaint Irene was sitting, while the sunset flamed, on a
      camp-stool in the middle of a street, hatless and
      trousered, painting a most remarkable picture, apparently
      of the Day of Judgment, for the whole world was enveloped
      in fire. Just as they passed her her easel fell down, and
      in a loud angry voice she said, 'Damn the beastly thing.'
      Then they saw Diva scuttling along the High Street carrying
      a bird-cage. She called up to an open window very
      lamentably, 'Oh, Dr Dobbie, please! My canary's had a fit!'
      From another window, also open and unblinded, positively
      inviting scrutiny, there came a baritone voice singing
      'Will ye no' come back again?' and there, sure enough, was
      the Padre from Birmingham, with the little grey mouse
      tinkling on the piano. They could not tear themselves away
      (indeed there was quite a lot of people listening) till the
      song was over, and then they stole up the street, at the
      head of which stood Mallards, and from the house just below
      it came a muffled cry of '<i>Quai-hai',</i> and Lucia's
      lips formed the syllables 'Major Benjy. At his diaries.'
      They tiptoed on past Mallards itself, for the garden-room
      window was open wide, and so past Mallards Cottage, till
      they were out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, entrancing,' said Lucia. 'They're all being
      themselves, and all so human and busy--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I don't get Mallards Cottage,' said Georgie, 'I shall
      die.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you must. You shall. Now it's time to go to bed,
      though I could wander about for ever. We must be up early
      in order to get to the house-agents' as soon as it's open.
      Woggles &amp; Pickstick, isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you've confused me,' said Georgie. 'Rather like it,
      but not quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs to bed: their rooms were next each
      other, with a communicating door. There was a bolt on
      Georgie's side of it, and he went swiftly across to this
      and fastened it. Even as he did so, he heard a key quietly
      turned from the other side of it. He undressed with the
      stealth of a burglar prowling about a house, for somehow it
      was shy work that he and Lucia should be going to bed so
      close to each other; he brushed his teeth with infinite
      precaution and bent low over the basin to eject (spitting
      would be too noisy a word) the water with which he had
      rinsed his mouth, for it would never do to let a sound of
      these intimate manoeuvres penetrate next door. When
      half-undressed he remembered that the house-agents' name
      was Woolgar &amp; Pipstow, and he longed to tap at Lucia's
      door and proclaim it, but the silence of the grave reigned
      next door, and perhaps Lucia was asleep already. Or was
      she, too, being as stealthy as he? Whichever it was
      (particularly if it was the last) he must not let a
      betrayal of his presence reach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got into bed and clicked out his light. That could be
      done quite boldly: she might hear that, for it only
      betokened that all was over. Then, in spite of this long
      day in the open air, which should have conduced to
      drowsiness, he felt terribly wide-awake, for the subject
      which had intermittently occupied his mind, shadowing it
      with dim apprehension, ever since Pepino's death, presented
      itself in the most garish colours. For years, by a pretty
      Riseholme fantasy, it had always been supposed that he was
      the implacably Platonic but devout lover of Lucia: somehow
      that interesting fiction had grown up, and Lucia had
      certainly abetted it as well as himself. She had let it be
      supposed that he was, and that she accepted this chaste
      fervour. But now that her year of widowhood was nearly
      over, there loomed in front of Georgie the awful fact that
      very soon there could be no earthly reason why he should
      not claim his reward for these years of devotion and
      exchange his passionate celibacy for an even more
      passionate matrimony. It was an unnerving thought that he
      might have the right before the summer was over, to tap at
      some door of communication like that which he had so
      carefully bolted (and she locked) and say, 'May I come in,
      darling?' He felt that the words would freeze on his tongue
      before he could utter them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Lucia expect him to ask to marry her? There was the
      crux and his imagination proceeded to crucify him upon it.
      They had posed for years as cherishing for each other a
      stainless devotion, but what if, with her, it had been no
      pose at all, but a dreadful reality? Had he been
      encouraging her to hope, by coming down to stay at this
      hotel in this very compromising manner? In his ghastly
      midnight musing, it seemed terribly likely. He had been
      very rash to come, and all this afternoon he had been
      pursuing his foolhardy career. He had said that life wasn't
      worth living if he could not get hold of Mallards Cottage,
      which was less than a stone's throw (even he could throw a
      stone as far as that) from the house she was to inhabit
      alone. Really it looked as if it was the proximity to her
      that made the cottage so desirable. If she only knew how
      embarrassing her proximity had been just now when he
      prepared himself for bed! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lucia always got what she wanted. There was a force
      about her he supposed (so different from poor Daisy's
      violent yappings and scufflings), which caused things to
      happen in the way she wished. He had fallen in with all her
      plans with a zest which it was only reasonable she should
      interpret favourably: only an hour or two ago he had
      solemnly affirmed that he must take Mallards Cottage, and
      the thing already was as good as done, for they were to
      breakfast to-morrow morning at eight, in order to be at the
      house-agents' (Woggle &amp; Pipsqueak, was it? He had
      forgotten again), as soon as it opened. Things happened
      like that for her: she got what she wanted. 'But never,
      never,' thought Georgie, 'shall she get me. I couldn't
      possibly marry her, and I won't. I want to live quietly and
      do my sewing and my sketching, and see lots of Lucia, and
      play any amount of duets with her, but not marry her. Pray
      God, she doesn't want me to!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was lying awake, too, next door, and if either of
      them could have known what the other was thinking about,
      they would both instantly have fallen into a refreshing
      sleep, instead of tossing and turning as they were doing.
      She, too, knew that for years she and Georgie had let it be
      taken for granted that they were mutually devoted, and had
      both about equally encouraged that impression. There had
      been an interlude, it is true, when that wonderful Olga
      Bracely had shone (like evening stars singing) over
      Riseholme, but she was to be absent from England for a
      year; besides she was married, and even if she had not been
      would certainly not have married Georgie. 'So we needn't
      consider Olga,' thought Lucia. 'It's all about Georgie and
      me. Dear Georgie: he was so terribly glad when I began to
      be myself again, and how he jumped at the plan of coming to
      Tilling and spending the night here! And how he froze on to
      the idea of taking Mallards Cottage as soon as he knew I
      had got Mallards! I'm afraid I've been encouraging him to
      hope. He knows that my year of widowhood is almost over,
      and on the very eve of its accomplishment, I take him off
      on this solitary expedition with me. Dear me: it looks as
      if I was positively asking for it. How perfectly horrible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was quite dark, Lucia felt herself blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What on earth am I to do?' continued these disconcerting
      reflections. 'If he asks me to marry him, I must certainly
      refuse, for I couldn't do so: quite impossible. And then
      when I say no, he has every right to turn on me, and say
      I've been leading him on. I've been taking moonlight walks
      with him, I'm at this moment staying alone with him in an
      hotel. Oh dear! Oh dear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sat up in bed and listened. She longed to hear sounds
      of snoring from the next room, for that would show that the
      thought of the fulfilment of his long devotion was not
      keeping him awake, but there was no sound of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must do something about it to-morrow,' she said to
      herself, 'for if I allow things to go on like this, these
      two months here with him will be one series of agitating
      apprehensions. I must make it quite clear that I won't
      before he asks me. I can't bear to think of hurting
      Georgie, but it will hurt him less if I show him beforehand
      he's got no chance. Something about the beauty of a
      friendship untroubled with passion. Something about the
      tranquillity that comes with age . . . There's that eternal
      old church clock striking three. Surely it must be fast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia lay down again: at last she was getting sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mallards,' she said to herself. 'Quaint Irene . . .
      Woffles and . . . Georgie will know. Certainly Tilling is
      fascinating . . . Intriguing, too . . . characters of
      strong individuality to be dealt with . . . A great
      variety, but I think I can manage them . . . And what about
      Miss Mapp? . . . Those wide grins . . . We shall see about
      that . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia awoke herself from a doze by giving a loud snore, and
      for one agonized moment thought it was Georgie, whom she
      had hoped to hear snoring, in alarming proximity to
      herself. That nightmare-spasm was quickly over, and she
      recognized that it was she that had done it. After all her
      trouble in not letting a sound of any sort penetrate
      through that door!
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie heard it. He was getting sleepy, too, in spite of
      his uneasy musings, but he was just wide-awake enough to
      realize where that noise had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if she snores as well . . .' he thought, and dozed
      off.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly nine o'clock in the morning when they set out
      for the house-agents', and the upper circles of Tilling
      were not yet fully astir. But there was a town-crier in a
      blue frock-coat ringing a bell in the High Street and
      proclaiming that the water-supply would be cut off that day
      from twelve noon till three in the afternoon. It was
      difficult to get to the house-agents', for the street where
      it was situated was being extensively excavated and they
      had chosen the wrong side of the road, and though they saw
      it opposite them when halfway down the street, a long
      detour must be made to reach it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But so characteristic, so charming,' said Lucia.
      'Naturally there is a town-crier in Tilling, and naturally
      the streets are up. Do not be so impatient, Georgie. Ah, we
      can cross here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a further period of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The occupier of Mallards Cottage,' said Mr Woolgar (or it
      might have been Mr Pipstow), 'is wanting to let for three
      months, July, August and September. I'm not so sure that
      she would entertain--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then will you please ring her up,' interrupted Georgie,
      'and say you've had a firm offer for two months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Woolgar turned round a crank like that used for starting
      rather old-fashioned motor-cars, and when a bell rang, he
      gave a number, and got into communication with the brown
      bungalow without proper plumbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very sorry, sir,' he said, 'but Miss Poppit has gone out
      for her sun-bath among the sand-dunes. She usually takes
      about three hours if fine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we're leaving again this morning,' said Georgie.
      'Can't her servant, or whoever it is, search the sand-dunes
      and ask her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll inquire, sir,' said Mr Woolgar sympathetically. 'But
      there are about two miles of sand-dunes, and she may be
      anywhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please inquire,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awful period, during which Mr Woolgar kept on
      saying 'Quite', 'Just so', 'I see', 'Yes, dear', with the
      most tedious monotony, in answer to unintelligible quacking
      noises from the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite impossible, I am afraid,' he said at length. 'Miss
      Poppit only keeps one servant, and she's got to look after
      the house. Besides, Miss Poppit likes . . . likes to be
      private when she's enjoying the sun.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how tarsome,' said Georgie. 'What am I to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, sir, there's Miss Poppit's mother you might get hold
      of. She is Mrs Wyse now. Lately married. A beautiful
      wedding. The house you want is her property.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know,' broke in Lucia. 'Sables and a Rolls-Royce. Mr
      Wyse has a monocle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, if you know the lady, madam, that will be all right,
      and I can give you her address. Starling Cottage, Porpoise
      Street. I will write it down for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, Porpoise Street!' whispered Lucia in an entranced
      aside. <i>'Com' e bello e molto characteristuoso!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was being done, Diva suddenly blew in, beginning
      to speak before she was wholly inside the office. A short
      tempestuous interlude ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--morning, Mr Woolgar,' said Diva, 'and I've let Wasters,
      so you can cross it off your books: such a fine morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, madam,' said Mr Woolgar. 'Very satisfactory. And I
      hope your dear little canary is better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still alive and in less pain, thank you, pip,' said Diva,
      and plunged through the excavations outside sooner than
      waste time in going round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Woolgar apparently understood that 'pip' was not a
      salutation but a disease of canaries, and did not say 'So
      long' or 'Pip pip'. Calm returned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll ring up Mrs Wyse to say you will call, madam,' he
      said. 'Let me see: what name? It has escaped me for the
      moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had never known it, it was difficult to see how it
      could have escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs Lucas and Mr Pillson,' said Lucia. 'Where is Porpoise
      Street?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two minutes' walk from here, madam. As if you were going
      up to Mallards, but first turning to the right just short
      of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Many thanks,' said Lucia, 'I know Mallards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The best house in Tilling, madam,' said Mr Woolgar, 'if
      you were wanting something larger than Mallards Cottage. It
      is on our books, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The pride of proprietorship tempted Lucia for a moment to
      say 'I've got it already,' but she refrained. The
      complications which might have ensued, had she asked the
      price of it, were endless . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'A great many houses to let in Tilling,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, madam, a rare lot of letting goes on about this time
      of year,' said Mr Woolgar, 'but they're all snapped up very
      quickly. Many ladies in Tilling like a little change in the
      summer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible (since time was so precious, and Georgie
      so feverishly apprehensive, after this warning, that
      somebody else would secure Mallards Cottage before him,
      although the owner was safe in the sand-dunes for the
      present) to walk round the excavations in the street, and
      like Diva they made an intrepid short cut among gas-pipes
      and water-mains and braziers and bricks to the other side.
      A sad splash of mud hurled itself against Georgie's
      fawn-coloured trousers as he stepped in a puddle, which was
      very tarsome, but it was useless to attempt to brush it off
      till it was dry. As they went up the now familiar street
      towards Mallards they saw quaint Irene leaning out of the
      upper window of a small house, trying to take down a board
      that hung outside it which advertised that this house, too,
      was to let: the fact of her removing it seemed to indicate
      that from this moment it was to let no longer. Just as they
      passed, the board, which was painted in the most amazing
      colours, slipped from her hand and crashed on to the
      pavement, narrowly missing Diva who simultaneously popped
      out of the front door. It broke into splinters at her feet,
      and she gave a shrill cry of dismay. Then perceiving Irene
      she called up, 'No harm done, dear,' and Irene, in a voice
      of fury, cried, 'No harm? My beautiful board's broken to
      smithereens. Why didn't you catch it, silly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A snort of infinite contempt was the only proper reply, and
      Diva trundled swiftly away into the High Street again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's like a game of general post, Georgie,' said Lucia
      excitedly, 'and we're playing too. Are they all letting
      their houses to each other? Is that it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't care whom they're letting them to,' said Georgie,
      'so long as I get Mallards Cottage. Look at this tarsome
      mud on my trousers, and I daren't try to brush it off. What
      will Mrs Wyse think? Here's Porpoise Street anyhow, and
      there's Starling Cottage. Elizabethan again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was of old oak, without a handle, but with a
      bobbin in the strictest style, and there was a thickly
      patinated green bronze chain hanging close by, which
      Georgie rightly guessed to be the bell-pull, and so he
      pulled it. A large bronze bell, which he had not perceived,
      hanging close to his head, thereupon broke into a clamour
      that might have been heard not only in the house but all
      over Tilling, and startled him terribly. Then bobbins and
      gadgets were manipulated from within and they were shown
      into a room in which two very diverse tastes were clearly
      exhibited. Oak beams crossed the ceiling, oak beams made a
      criss-cross on the walls: there was a large open fireplace
      of grey Dutch bricks, and on each side of the grate an
      ingle-nook with a section of another oak beam to sit down
      upon. The windows were latticed and had antique levers for
      their control: there was a refectory-table and a
      spice-chest and some pewter mugs and a Bible-box and a
      coffin-stool. All this was one taste, and then came in
      another, for the room was full of beautiful objects of a
      very different sort. The refectory-table was covered with
      photographs in silver frames: one was of a man in uniform
      and many decorations signed 'Cecco Faraglione', another of
      a lady in Court dress with a quantity of plumes on her head
      signed 'Amelia Faraglione'. Another was of the King of
      Italy, another of a man in a frock-coat signed 'Wyse'. In
      front of these, rather prominent, was an open purple
      morocco box in which reposed the riband and cross of a
      Member of the Order of the British Empire. There was a
      cabinet of china in one corner with a malachite vase above
      it: there was an occasional table with a marble mosaic top:
      there was a satinwood piano draped with a piece of
      embroidery: a palm-tree: a green velvet sofa over the end
      of which lay a sable coat, and all these things spoke of
      post-Elizabethan refinements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before Lucia had time to admire them all, there came a
      jingling from a door over which hung a curtain of reeds and
      beads, and Mrs Wyse entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs Lucas,' she said, 'but
      they thought I was in the garden, and I was in my boudoir
      all the time. And you must excuse my deshabille, just my
      shopping-frock. And Mr Pillson, isn't it? So pleased. Pray
      be seated.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She heaved the sable coat off the end of the sofa on to the
      window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We've just been to see the house-agent,' said Georgie in a
      great hurry, as he turned his muddied leg away from the
      light, 'and he told us that you might help me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most happy I am sure, if I can. Pray tell me,' said Mrs
      Wyse, in apparent unconsciousness of what she could
      possibly help him about.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mallards Cottage,' said Georgie. 'There seems to be no
      chance of getting hold of Miss Poppit and we've got to
      leave before she comes back from her sun-bath. I so much
      want to take it for August and September.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Wyse made a little cooing sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Isabel!' she said. 'My daughter. Out in the
      sand-dunes all morning! What if a tramp came along? I say
      to her. But no use: she calls it the Browning Society, and
      she must not miss a meeting. So quick and clever! Browning,
      not the poet but the action of the sun.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most amusing!' said Georgie. 'With regard to Mallards
      Cottage--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The little house is mine, as no doubt Mr Woolgar told
      you,' said Mrs Wyse, forgetting she had been in complete
      ignorance of these manoeuvres, 'but you must certainly come
      and see over it, before anything is settled . . . Ah, here
      is Mr Wyse. Algernon: Mrs Lucas and Mr Pillson. Mr Pillson
      wants to take Mallards Cottage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia thought she had never seen anyone so perfectly
      correct and polite as Mr Wyse. He gave little bows and
      smiles to each as he spoke to them, and that in no
      condescending manner, nor yet cringingly, but as one
      consorting with his high-bred equals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From your beautiful Riseholme, I understand,' he said to
      Lucia (bowing to Riseholme as well). 'And we are all
      encouraging ourselves to hope that for two months at the
      least the charm of our picturesque--do you not find it
      so?--little Tilling will give Susan and myself the
      inestimable pleasure of being your neighbours. We shall
      look forward to August with keen anticipation. Remind me,
      dear Susan, to tell Amelia what is in store for us.' He
      bowed to August, Susan and Amelia and continued--'And now I
      hear that Mr Pillson' (he bowed to Georgie and observed the
      drying spot of mud) 'is "after" as they say, after Mallards
      Cottage. This will indeed be a summer for Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, during this pretty speech which Mr Wyse delivered
      in the most finished manner, was taking notes of his
      costume and appearance. His clean-shaven face, with
      abundant grey hair brushed back from his forehead, was that
      of an actor who has seen his best days, but who has given
      command performances at Windsor. He wore a brown velveteen
      coat, a Byronic collar and a tie strictured with a
      cameo-ring: he wore brown knickerbockers and stockings to
      match, he wore neat golfing shoes. He looked as if he might
      be going to play golf, but somehow it didn't seem likely .
      . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie and Lucia made polite deprecating murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was telling Mr Pillson he must certainly see over it
      first,' said Mrs Wyse. 'There are the keys of the cottage
      in my boudoir, if you'll kindly fetch them, Algernon. And
      the Royce is at the door, I see, so if Mrs Lucas will allow
      us, we will all drive up there together, and show her and
      Mr Pillson what there is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      While Algernon was gone, Mrs Wyse picked up the photograph
      signed Amelia Faraglione.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You recognize, no doubt, the family likeness,' she said to
      Lucia. 'My husband's sister Amelia who married the Conte di
      Faraglione, of the old Neapolitan nobility. That is he.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charming,' said Lucia. 'And so like Mr Wyse. And that
      Order? What is that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Wyse hastily shut the morocco box.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So like servants to leave that about,' she said. 'But they
      seem proud of it. Graciously bestowed upon me. Member of
      the British Empire. Ah, here is Algernon with the keys. I
      was showing Mrs Lucas, dear, the photograph of Amelia. She
      recognized the likeness at once. Now let us all pack in. A
      warm morning, is it not? I don't think I shall need my
      furs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The total distance to be traversed was not more than a
      hundred yards, but Porpoise Street was very steep, and the
      cobbles which must be crossed very unpleasant to walk on,
      so Mrs Wyse explained. They had to wait some little while
      at the corner, twenty yards away from where they started,
      for a van was coming down the street from the direction of
      Mallards, and the Royce could not possibly pass it, and
      then they came under fire of the windows of Miss Mapp's
      garden-room. As usual at this hour she was sitting there
      with the morning paper in her hand in which she could
      immerse herself if anybody passed whom she did not wish to
      see, but was otherwise intent on the movements of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva Plaistow had looked in with the news that she had seen
      Lucia and Georgie at the house-agents', and that her canary
      still lived. Miss Mapp professed her delight to hear about
      the canary, but was secretly distrustful of whether Diva
      had seen the visitors or not. Diva was so imaginative; to
      have seen a man and a woman who were strangers was quite
      enough to make her believe she had seen Them. Then the
      Royce heaved into sight round the corner below, and Miss
      Mapp became much excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think, Diva,' she said, 'that this is Mrs Lucas's
      beautiful car coming. Probably she is going to call on me
      about something she wants to know. If you sit at the piano
      you will see her as she gets out. Then we shall know
      whether you really--'
    </p>
    <p>
      The car came slowly up, barked loudly and instead of
      stopping at the front door of Mallards, turned up the
      street in the direction of Mallards Cottage. Simultaneously
      Miss Mapp caught sight of that odious chauffeur of Mrs
      Wyse's. She could not see more than people's knees in the
      car itself (that was the one disadvantage of the
      garden-room window being so high above the street), but
      there were several pairs of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, it's only Susan's great lumbering bus,' she said,
      'filling up the street as usual. Probably she has found out
      that Mrs Lucas is staying at the Trader's Arms, and has
      gone to leave cards. Such a woman to shove herself in where
      she's not wanted <i>I</i> never saw. Luckily I told Mrs
      Lucas what a dreadful snob she was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A disappointment to you, dear, when you thought Mrs Lucas
      was coming to call,' said Diva. 'But I did see them this
      morning at Woolgar's and it's no use saying I didn't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp uttered a shrill cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva, they've stopped at Mallards Cottage. They're getting
      out. Susan first--so like her--and . . . it's Them. She's
      got hold of them somehow . . . There's Mr Wyse with the
      keys, bowing . . . They're going in . . . I was right,
      then, when I saw them peering in through the windows
      yesterday. Mr Pillson's come to see the house, and the
      Wyses have got hold of them. You may wager they know by now
      about the Count and Countess Faradiddleone, and the Order
      of the British Empire. I really didn't think Mrs Lucas
      would be so easily taken in. However, it's no business of
      mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There could not have been a better reason for Miss Mapp
      being violently interested in all that happened. Then an
      idea struck her and the agitated creases in her face faded
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us pop in to Mallards Cottage, Diva, while they are
      still there,' she said. 'I should hate to think that Mrs
      Lucas should get her ideas of the society she will meet in
      Tilling from poor common Susan. Probably they would like a
      little lunch before their long drive back to Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspection of the cottage had taken very little time.
      The main point in Georgie's mind was that Foljambe should
      be pleased, and there was an excellent bedroom for
      Foljambe, where she could sit when unoccupied. The rooms
      that concerned him had been viewed through the windows from
      the street the evening before. Consequently Miss Mapp had
      hardly had time to put on her garden-hat, and trip up the
      street with Diva, when the inspecting party came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet Susan!' she said. 'I saw your car go by . . . Dear
      Mrs Lucas, good morning, I just popped across--this is Mrs
      Plaistow--to see if you would not come and have an early
      lunch with me before you drive back to your lovely
      Riseholme. Any time would suit me, for I never have any
      breakfast. Twelve, half-past twelve? A little something?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So kind of you,' said Lucia, 'but Mrs Wyse has just asked
      us to lunch with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see,' said Miss Mapp, grinning frightfully. 'Such a
      pity. I had hoped--but there it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly it was incumbent on sweet Susan to ask her to join
      them at this early lunch, but sweet Susan showed no signs
      of doing anything of the sort. Off went Lucia and Georgie
      to the Trader's Arms to pack their belongings and leave the
      rest of the morning free, and the Wyses, after vainly
      trying to persuade them to drive there in the Royce, got
      into it themselves and backed down the street till it could
      turn in the slightly wider space opposite Miss Mapp's
      garden-room. This took a long time, and she was not able to
      get to her own front door till the manoeuvre was executed,
      for as often as she tried to get round the front of the car
      it took a short run forward, and it threatened to squash
      her flat against the wall of her own room if she tried to
      squeeze round behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were topics to gloat over which consoled her for
      this act of social piracy on the part of the Wyses. It was
      a noble stroke to have let Mallards for fifteen guineas a
      week without garden-produce, and an equally brilliant act
      to have got Diva's house for eight with garden-produce, for
      Diva had some remarkably fine plum-trees, the fruit of
      which would be ripe during her tenancy, not to mention
      apples: Miss Mapp foresaw a kitchen-cupboard the doors of
      which could not close because of the jam-pots within. Such
      reflections made a happy mental background as she hurried
      out into the town, for there were businesses to be
      transacted without delay. She first went to the
      house-agents' and had rather a job to convince Mr Woolgar
      that the letting of Mallards was due to her own
      advertisement in <i>The Times,</i> and that therefore she
      owed no commission to his firm, but her logic proved
      irresistible. Heated but refreshed by that encounter, she
      paid a visit to her greengrocer and made a pleasant
      arrangement for the sale of the produce of her own
      kitchen-garden at Mallards during the months of August and
      September. This errand brought her to the east end of the
      High Street, and there was Georgie already established on
      the belvedere busy sketching the Landgate, before he went
      to breakfast (as those Wyses always called lunch) in
      Porpoise Street. Miss Mapp did not yet know whether he had
      taken Mallards Cottage or not, and that must be instantly
      ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned on the railing close beside him, and moved a
      little, rustled a little, till he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr Pillson, how ashamed of myself I am!' she said.
      'But I couldn't help taking a peep at your lovely little
      sketch. So rude of me: just like an inquisitive stranger in
      the street. Never meant to interrupt you, but to steal away
      again when I'd had my peep. Every moment's precious to you,
      I know, as you're off this afternoon after your early
      lunch. But I must ask you whether your hotel was
      comfortable. I should be miserable if I thought that I had
      recommended it, and that you didn't like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very comfortable indeed, thank you,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp sidled up to the bench where he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will just perch here for a moment before I flit off
      again,' she said, 'if you'll promise not to take any notice
      of me, but go on with your picky, as if I was not here. How
      well you've got the perspective! I always sit here for two
      or three minutes every morning to feast my eyes on the
      beauty of the outlook. What a pity you can't stay longer
      here! You've only had a glimpse of our sweet Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie held up his drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have I got the perspective right, do you think?' he said.
      'Isn't it tarsome when you mean to make a road go downhill
      and it will go up instead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No fear of that with you!' ejaculated Miss Mapp. 'If I was
      a little bolder I should ask you to send your drawing to
      our Art Society here. We have a little exhibition every
      summer. Could I persuade you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm afraid I shan't be able to finish it this morning,'
      said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No chance then of your coming back?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In August, I hope,' said he, 'for I've taken Mallards
      Cottage for two months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr Pillson, that is good news!' cried Miss Mapp.
      'Lovely! All August and September. Fancy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got to be away for a week in August,' said Georgie,
      'as we've got an Elizabethan fête at Riseholme. I'm Francis
      Drake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a trove for Miss Mapp and must be published at
      once. She prepared to flit off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh how wonderful!' she said. 'Dear me, I can quite see
      you. The <i>Golden Hind!</i> Spanish treasure! All the pomp
      and majesty. I wonder if I could manage to pop down to see
      it. But I won't interrupt you any more. So pleased to think
      it's only au reservoir and not good-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up the street again, bursting with her budget of
      news. Only the Wyses could possibly know that Georgie had
      taken Mallards Cottage, and nobody that he was going to
      impersonate Francis Drake . . . There was the Padre talking
      to Major Benjy, no doubt on his way to the steam-tram, and
      there were Diva and Irene a little farther on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Padre: good morning, Major Benjy,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morrow, Mistress Mapp,' said the Padre. 'An' hoo's
      the time o' day wi' ye? 'Tis said you've a fair tenant for
      yon Mallards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp fired off her news in a broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, I have, Padre,' she said. 'And there's Mallards
      Cottage, too, about which you won't have heard. Mr Pillson
      has taken that, though he won't be here all the time as
      he's playing Francis Drake in a fête at Riseholme for a
      week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy was not in a very good temper. It was
      porridge-morning with him, and his porridge had been
      burned. Miss Mapp already suspected something of the sort,
      for there had been loud angry sounds from within as she
      passed his dining-room window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That fellow whom I saw with Mrs Lucas this morning with a
      cape over his arm?' he said scornfully. 'Not much of a hand
      against the Spaniards, I should think. Ridiculous!
      Tea-parties with a lot of old cats more in his line.
      Pshaw!' And away he went to the tram, shovelling passengers
      off the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Porridge burned, I expect,' said Miss Mapp, thoughtfully,
      'though I couldn't say for certain. Morning, dear Irene.
      Another artist is coming to Tilling for August and
      September.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoot awa', woman,' said Irene, in recognition of the
      Padre's presence. 'I ken that fine, for Mistress Wyse told
      me half an hour agone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he'll be away for a week, though of course you know
      that, too,' said Miss Mapp, slightly nettled. 'Acting
      Francis Drake in a fête at Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva trundled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't suppose you've heard, Elizabeth,' she said in a
      great hurry, 'that Mr Pillson has taken Mallards Cottage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp smiled pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite correct, dear Diva,' she said. 'Mr Pillson told me
      himself hours ago. He's sketching the Landgate now--a sweet
      picky--and insisted that I should sit down and chat to him
      while he worked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lor! How you draw them all in, Mapp,' said quaint Irene.
      'He looks a promising young man for his age, but it's time
      he had his hair dyed again. Grey at the roots.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre tore himself away; he had to hurry home and tell
      wee wifie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aweel, I mustn't stand daffing here,' he said, 'I've got
      my sermon to think on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp did a little more shopping, hung about on the
      chance of seeing Lucia again, and then went back to
      Mallards, to attend to her sweet flowers. Some of the beds
      wanted weeding, and now as she busied herself with that
      useful work and eradicated groundsel, each plant as she
      tore it up and flung it into her basket might have been Mr
      and Mrs Wyse. It was very annoying that they had stuck
      their hooks (so the process represented itself to her
      vigorous imagery) into Lucia, for Miss Mapp had intended to
      have no one's hook there but her own. She wanted to run
      her, to sponsor her, to arrange little parties for her, and
      cause Lucia to arrange little parties at her dictation,
      and, while keeping her in her place, show her off to
      Tilling. Providence, or whatever less beneficent power
      ruled the world, had not been considerate of her clear
      right to do this, for it was she who had been put to the
      expense of advertising Mallards in <i>The Times,</i> and it
      was entirely owing to that that Lucia had come down here,
      and wound up that pleasant machine of subletting houses, so
      that everybody scored financially as well as got a change.
      But there was nothing to be done about that for the
      present: she must wait till Lucia arrived here, and then be
      both benignant and queenly. A very sweet woman, up till
      now, was her verdict, though possibly lacking in fine
      discernment, as witnessed by her having made friends with
      the Wyses. Then there was Georgie: she was equally well
      disposed towards him for the present, but he, like Lucia,
      must be good, and recognize that she was the arbiter of all
      things social in Tilling. If he behaved properly in that
      regard she would propose him as an honorary member of the
      Tilling Art Society, and, as member of the hanging
      committee, see that his work had a conspicuous place on the
      walls of the exhibition, but it was worth remembering (in
      case he was not good) that quaint Irene had said that his
      hair was dyed, and that Major Benjy thought that he would
      have been very little use against the Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But thinking was hungry work, and weeding was dirty work,
      and she went indoors to wash her hands for lunch after this
      exciting morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dreadful block in Porpoise Street when Lucia's
      car came to pick up her and Georgie after their breakfast
      at Starling Cottage, for Mrs Wyse's Royce was already drawn
      up there. The two purred and backed and advanced foot by
      foot, they sidled and stood on pavements meant for
      pedestrians, and it was not till Lucia's car had gone
      backwards again round the corner below Miss Mapp's
      garden-room, and Mrs Wyse's forward towards the High
      Street, that Lucia's could come to the door, and the way
      down Porpoise Street lie open for their departure to
      Riseholme. As long as they were in sight, Susan stood
      waving her hand, and Algernon bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often during the drive Lucia tried, but always in vain, to
      start the subject which had kept them both awake last
      night, and tell Georgie that never would she marry again,
      but the moment she got near the topic of friendship, or
      even wondered how long Mrs Plaistow had been a widow or
      whether Major Benjy would ever marry, Georgie saw a cow or
      a rainbow or something out of the window and violently
      directed attention to it. She could not quite make out what
      was going on in his mind. He shied away from such topics as
      friendship and widowhood, and she wondered if that was
      because he was not feeling quite ready yet, but was
      screwing himself up. If he only would let her develop those
      topics she could spare him the pain of a direct refusal,
      and thus soften the blow. But she had to give it up,
      determining, however, that when he came to dine with her
      that evening, she would not be silenced by his
      irrelevances: she would make it quite clear to him, before
      he embarked on his passionate declaration that, with all
      her affection for him, she could never marry him . . . Poor
      Georgie!
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped him at his house, and as soon as he had told
      Foljambe about his having taken the house at Tilling (for
      that must be done at once), he would come across to the
      Hurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope she will like the idea,' said Georgie very gravely,
      as he got out, 'and there is an excellent room for her,
      isn't there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe opened the door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A pleasant outing, I hope, sir,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very indeed, thank you, Foljambe,' said Georgie. 'And I've
      got great news. Mrs Lucas has taken a house at Tilling for
      August and September, and so have I. Quite close to hers.
      You could throw a stone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That'll be an agreeable change,' said Foljambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think you'll like it. A beautiful bedroom for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure I shall,' said Foljambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was immensely relieved, and, as he went gaily
      across to the Hurst, he quite forgot for the time about
      this menace of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She likes the idea,' he said before he had opened the gate
      into Perdita's garden, where Lucia was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, the most wonderful thing,' cried she. 'Oh,
      Foljambe's pleased, is she? So glad. An excellent bedroom.
      I knew she would. But I've found a letter from Adele
      Brixton; you know, Lady Brixton who always goes to America
      when her husband comes to England, and the other way about,
      so that they only pass each other on the Atlantic; she
      wants to take the Hurst for three months. She came down
      here for a Sunday, don't you remember, and adored it. I
      instantly telephoned to say I would let it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that is luck for you,' said Georgie. 'But three
      months; what will you do for the third?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, I don't know, and I'm not going to think,' she
      said. 'Something will happen: it's sure to. My dear, it's
      perfect rapture to feel the great tide of life flowing
      again. How I'm going to set to work on all the old
      interests and the new ones as well. Tilling, the age of
      Anne, and I shall get a translation of Pope's <i>Iliad</i>
      and of Plato's <i>Symposium</i> till I can rub up my Greek
      again. I have been getting lazy, and I have been
      getting--let us go into dinner--narrow. I think you have
      been doing the same. We must open out, and receive new
      impressions, and adjust ourselves to new conditions!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This last sentence startled Georgie very much, though it
      might only apply to Tilling, but Lucia did not seem to
      notice his faltering step as he followed her into the
      panelled dining-room with the refectory-table, below which
      it was so hard to adjust the feet with any comfort, owing
      to the foot-rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those people at Tilling,' she said, 'how interesting it
      will all be. They seemed to me very much alive, especially
      the women, who appear to have got their majors and their
      padres completely under their thumbs. Delicious, isn't it,
      to think of the new interchange of experience which awaits
      us. Here, nothing happens. Our dear Daisy gets a little
      rounder and Mrs Antrobus a little deafer. We're in a rut:
      Riseholme is in a rut. We want, both of us, to get out of
      it, and now we're going to. Fresh fields and pastures new,
      Georgie . . . Nothing on your mind, my dear? You were so
      <i>distrait</i> as we drove home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some frightful revivification, thought poor Georgie, had
      happened to Lucia. It had been delightful, only a couple of
      days ago, to see her returning to her normal interests, but
      this repudiation of Riseholme and the craving for the
      <i>Iliad</i> and Tilling and the <i>Symposium</i> indicated
      an almost dangerous appetite for novelty. Or was it only
      that having bottled herself up for a year, it was natural
      that, the cork being now out, she should overflow in these
      ebullitions? She seemed to be lashing her tail, goading
      herself to some further revelation of her mental or
      spiritual needs. He shuddered at the thought of what
      further novelty might be popping out next. The question
      perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sorry I was <i>distrait,'</i> said he. 'Of course I
      was anxious about how Foljambe might take the idea of
      Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia struck the pomander, and it was a relief to Georgie
      to know that Grosvenor would at once glide in . . . She
      laughed and laid her hand affectionately on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, dear, you are'--she took refuge in Italian as
      Grosvenor appeared--'you are <i>una vecchia signorina.'</i>
      (That means 'old maid', thought Georgie.) 'Wider horizons,
      Georgie: that is what you want. Put the rest of the food on
      the table, Grosvenor, and we'll help ourselves. Coffee in
      the music-room when I ring.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was ghastly: Lucia, with all this talk of his being an
      old maid and needing to adapt himself to new conditions,
      was truly alarming. He almost wondered if she had been
      taking monkey-gland during her seclusion. Was she going to
      propose to him in the middle of dinner? Never, in all the
      years of his friendship with her, had he felt himself so
      strangely alien. But he was still the master of his fate
      (at least he hoped so), and it should not be that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I give you some strawberry fool?' he asked
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not seem to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, we must have ickle talk, before I ring for
      coffee,' she said. 'How long have you and I been dear
      friends? Longer than either of us care to think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But all so pleasant,' said Georgie, rubbing his cold moist
      hands on his napkin . . . He wondered if drowning was
      anything like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, what do the years matter, if they have only
      deepened and broadened our friendship? Happy years,
      Georgie, bringing their sheaves with them. That lovely
      scene in Esmondi; Winchester Cathedral! And now we're both
      getting on. You're rather alone in the world, and so am I,
      but people like us with this dear strong bond of friendship
      between us can look forward to old age--can't we?--without
      any qualms. Tranquillity comes with years, and that horrid
      thing which Freud calls sex is expunged. We must read some
      Freud, I think; I have read none at present. That was one
      of the things I wanted to say all the time that you would
      show me cows out of the window. Our friendship is just
      perfect as it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's relief when he found that Foljambe liked the idea
      of Tilling was nothing, positively nothing, to the relief
      he felt now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, how sweet of you to say that,' he said. 'I, too,
      find the quality of our friendship perfect in every way.
      Quite impossible, in fact, to think of--I mean, I quite
      agree with you. As you say, we're getting on in years, I
      mean I am. You're right a thousand times.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia saw the sunlit dawn of relief in Georgie's face, and
      though she had been quite sincere in hoping that he would
      not be terribly hurt when she hinted to him that he must
      give up all hopes of being more to her than he was, she had
      not quite expected this effulgence. It was as if instead of
      pronouncing his sentence, she had taken from him some
      secret burden of terrible anxiety. For the moment her own
      satisfaction at having brought this off without paining him
      was swallowed up in surprise that he was so far from being
      pained. Was it possible that all his concern to interest
      her in cows and rainbows was due to apprehension that she
      might be leading up, <i>via</i> the topics of friendship
      and marriage, to something exceedingly different from the
      disclosure which had evidently gratified him rather than
      the reverse?
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck the pomander quite a sharp blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us go and have our coffee then,' she said. 'It is
      lovely that we are of one mind. Lovely! And there's another
      subject we haven't spoken about at all. Miss Mapp. What do
      you make of Miss Mapp? There was a look in her eye when she
      heard we were going to lunch with Mrs Wyse that amazed me.
      She would have liked to bite her or scratch her. What did
      it mean? It was as if Mrs Wyse--she asked me to call her
      Susan by the way, but I'm not sure that I can manage it
      just yet without practising--as if Mrs Wyse had pocketed
      something of hers. Most extraordinary. I don't belong to
      Miss Mapp. Of course it's easy to see that she thinks
      herself very much superior to all the rest of Tilling. She
      says that all her friends are angels and lambs, and then
      just crabs them a little. <i>Marcate mie parole,
      Georgino!</i> I believe she wants to run me. I believe
      Tilling is seething with intrigue. But we shall see. How I
      hate all that sort of thing! We have had a touch of it now
      and then in Riseholme. As if it mattered who took the lead!
      We should aim at being equal citizens of a noble republic,
      where art and literature and all the manifold interests of
      the world are our concern. Now let us have a little music.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might be the state of affairs at Tilling,
      Riseholme during this month of July boiled and seethed with
      excitements. It was just like old times, and all circled,
      as of old, round Lucia. She had taken the plunge; she had
      come back (though just now for so brief a space before her
      entering upon Mallards) into her native centrality.
      Gradually, and in increasing areas, grey and white and
      violet invaded the unrelieved black in which she had spent
      the year of her widowhood; one day she wore a white belt,
      another there were grey panels in her skirt, another her
      garden-hat had a violet riband on it. Even Georgie, who had
      a great eye for female attire, could not accurately follow
      these cumulative changes: he could not be sure whether she
      had worn a grey cloak before, or whether she had had white
      gloves in church last Sunday. Then, instead of letting her
      hair droop in slack and mournful braids over her ears, it
      resumed its old polished and corrugated appearance, and on
      her pale cheeks (ashen with grief) there bloomed a little
      brown rouge, which made her look as if she had been playing
      golf again, and her lips certainly were ruddier. It was all
      intensely exciting, a series of subtle changes at the end
      of which, by the middle of July, her epiphany in church
      without anything black about her, and with the bloom of her
      vitality quite restored, passed almost unremarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      These outward and visible signs were duly representative of
      what had taken place within. Time, the great healer, had
      visited her sick-room, laid his hand on her languid brow,
      and the results were truly astonishing. Lucia became as
      good as new, or as good as old. Mrs Antrobus and her tall
      daughters, Piggy and Goosie, Georgie and Daisy and her
      husband, greedy Robert, Colonel Boucher and his wife, and
      the rest were all bidden to dinner at the Hurst once more,
      and sometimes Lucia played to them the slow movement of the
      'Moonlight' Sonata, and sometimes she instructed them in
      such elements of Contract Bridge as she had mastered during
      the day. She sketched, she played the organ in church in
      the absence of the organist who had measles, she sang a
      solo, 'O for the wings of a Dove' when he recovered and the
      leading chorister got chicken-pox, she had lessons in
      book-binding at 'Ye Signe of ye Daffodille', she sat in
      Perdita's garden, not reading Shakespeare, but Pope's
      <i>Iliad,</i> and murmured half-forgotten fragments of
      Greek irregular verbs as she went to sleep. She had a plan
      for visiting Athens in the spring ("the violet-crowned", is
      not that a lovely epithet, Georgie?') and in compliment to
      Queen Anne regaled her guests with rich thick chocolate.
      The hounds of spring were on the winter traces of her
      widowhood, and snapped up every fragment of it, and indeed
      spring seemed truly to have returned to her, so various and
      so multi-coloured were the blossoms that were unfolding.
      Never at all had Riseholme seen Lucia in finer artistic and
      intellectual fettle, and it was a long time since she had
      looked so gay. The world, or at any rate Riseholme, which
      at Riseholme came to much the same thing, had become her
      parish again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, worked to the bone with playing duets, with
      consulting Foljambe as to questions of linen and plate (for
      it appeared that Isabel Poppit, in pursuance of the simple
      life, slept between blankets in the back-yard, and ate
      uncooked vegetables out of a wooden bowl like a dog), with
      learning Vanderbilt conventions, with taking part in Royal
      processions across the green, with packing his bibelots and
      sending them to the bank, with sketching, so that he might
      be in good form when he began to paint at Tilling with a
      view to exhibiting in the Art Society, wondered what was
      the true source of these stupendous activities of Lucia's,
      whether she was getting fit, getting in training, so to
      speak, for a campaign at Tilling. Somehow it seemed likely,
      for she would hardly think it worth while to run the
      affairs of Riseholme with such energy, when she was about
      to disappear from it for three months. Or was she intending
      to let Riseholme see how dreadfully flat everything would
      become when she left them? Very likely both these purposes
      were at work; it was like her to kill two birds with one
      stone. Indeed, she was perhaps killing three birds with one
      stone, for multifarious as were the interests in which she
      was engaged there was one, now looming large in Riseholme,
      namely the Elizabethan fête, of which she seemed strangely
      unconscious. Her drive, her powers of instilling her
      friends with her own fervour, never touched that: she did
      not seem to know that a fête was being contemplated at all,
      though now a day seldom passed without a procession of some
      sort crossing the green or a Morris-dance getting entangled
      with the choristers practising madrigals, or a crowd of
      soldiers and courtiers being assembled near the front
      entrance of the Ambermere Arms, while Daisy harangued them
      from a chair put on the top of a table, pausing
      occasionally because she forgot her words, or in order to
      allow them to throw up their hats and cry 'God Save the
      Queen's Grace', 'To hell with Spain', and other suitable
      ejaculations. Daisy, occasionally now in full dress, ruff
      and pearls and all, came across to the gate of the Hurst,
      to wait for the procession to join her, and Lucia sitting
      in Perdita's garden would talk to her about Tilling or the
      importance of being prudent if you were vulnerable at
      contract, apparently unaware that Daisy was dressed up at
      all. Once Lucia came out of the Ambermere Arms when Daisy
      was actually mounting the palfrey that drew the milk-cart
      for a full-dress rehearsal, and she seemed to be positively
      palfrey-blind. She merely said 'Don't forget that you and
      Robert are dining with me to-night. Half-past seven, so
      that we shall get a good evening's bridge,' and went on her
      way . . . Or she would be passing the pond on which the
      framework of the <i>Golden Hind</i> was already
      constructed, and on which Georgie was even then kneeling
      down to receive the accolade amid the faint cheers of Piggy
      and Goosie, and she just waved her hand to Georgie and
      said: <i>'Musica</i> after lunch, Georgie?' She made no
      sarcastic comments to anybody, and did not know that they
      were doing anything out of the ordinary.

    <p>
      Under this pointed unconsciousness of hers, a species of
      blight spread over the scheme to which Riseholme ought to
      have been devoting its most enthusiastic energies. The
      courtiers were late for rehearsals, they did not even
      remove their cigarettes when they bent to kiss the Queen's
      hand, Piggy and Goosie made steps of Morris-dances when
      they ought to have been holding up Elizabeth's train, and
      Georgie snatched up a cushion, when the accolade was
      imminent, to protect his shoulder. The choir-boys droned
      their way through madrigals, sucking peppermints, there was
      no life, no keenness about it all, because Lucia, who was
      used to inspire all Riseholme's activities, was unaware
      that anything was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning when only a fortnight of July was still to run,
      Drake was engaged on his croquet-lawn tapping the balls
      about and trying to tame his white satin shoes which hurt
      terribly. From the garden next door came the familiar
      accents of the Queen's speech to her troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And though I am only a weak woman,' declaimed Daisy who
      was determined to go through the speech without referring
      to her book. 'Though I am only a weak woman, a weak
      woman--' she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yet I have the heart of a Prince,' shouted Drake with the
      friendly intention of prompting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, Georgie. Or ought it to be Princess, do you
      think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No: Prince,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prince,' cried Daisy. 'Though I am only a weak woman, yet
      I have the heart of a Prince . . . Let me see . . .
      Prince.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie,' said Daisy in her ordinary voice. 'Do stop your
      croquet a minute and come to the paling. I want to talk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm trying to get used to these shoes,' said Georgie.
      'They hurt frightfully. I shall have to take them to
      Tilling and wear them there. Oh, I haven't told you, Lady
      Brixton came down yesterday evening--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that,' said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--and she thinks that her brother will take my house for a
      couple of months, as long as I don't leave any servants.
      He'll be here for the fête, if he does, so I wonder if you
      could put me up. How's Robert's cold?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Worse,' she said. 'I'm worse too. I can't remember half of
      what I knew by heart a week ago. Isn't there some
      memory-system?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lots, I believe,' said Georgie. 'But it's rather late.
      They don't improve your memory all in a minute. I really
      think you had better read your speech to the troops, as if
      it was the opening of Parliament.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't,' said Daisy, taking off her ruff. 'I'll learn it
      if it costs me the last breath of blood in my body--I mean
      drop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well it will be very awkward if you forget it all,' said
      Georgie. 'We can't cheer nothing at all. Such a pity,
      because your voice carries perfectly now. I could hear you
      while I was breakfasting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it's not only that,' said Daisy. 'There's no life in
      the thing. It doesn't look as if it was happening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, that's true,' said Georgie. 'These tarsome shoes of
      mine are real enough, though!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I begin to think we ought to have had a producer,' said
      Daisy. 'But it was so much finer to do it all ourselves,
      like--like Oberammergau. Does Lucia ever say anything about
      it? I think it's too mean for words of her to take no
      interest in it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you must remember that you asked her only to be my
      wife,' said Georgie. 'Naturally she wouldn't like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She ought to help us instead of going about as if we were
      all invisible,' exclaimed Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, she did offer to help you. At least, I told you
      ages ago, that I felt sure she would if you asked her to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I feel inclined to chuck the whole thing,' said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you can't. Masses of tickets have been sold. And who's
      to pay for the <i>Golden Hind</i> and the roast sheep and
      all the costumes?' asked Georgie. 'Not to mention all our
      trouble. Why not ask her to help, if you want her to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, will you ask her?' said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' said Georgie very firmly. 'You've been
      managing it from the first. It's your show. If I were you,
      I would ask her at once. She'll be over here in a few
      minutes, as we're going to have a music. Pop in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A melodious cry of <i>'Georgino mio!'</i> resounded from
      the open window of Georgie's drawing-room, and he hobbled
      away down the garden walk. Ever since that beautiful
      understanding they had arrived at, that both of them
      shrank, as from a cup of hemlock, from the idea of
      marriage, they had talked Italian or baby-language to a
      surprising extent from mere lightness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me tummin',' he called. ''Oo very good girl, Lucia. 'Oo
      <i>molto punctuale.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      (He was not sure about that last word, nor was Lucia, but
      she understood it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Georgino! Che curiose scalpe!'</i> said Lucia, leaning
      out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be so <i>cattiva.</i> They are <i>cattivo</i>
      enough,' said Georgie. 'But Drake did have shoes exactly
      like these.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The mere mention of Drake naturally caused Lucia to talk
      about something else. She did not understand any allusion
      to Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now for a good practice,' she said, as Georgie limped into
      the drawing-room. 'Foljambe beamed at me. How happy it all
      is! I hope you said you were at home to nobody. Let us
      begin at once. Can you manage the <i>sostenuto</i> pedal in
      those odd shoes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs Quantock, sir,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Daisy darling,' said Lucia effusively. 'Come to hear our
      little practice? We must play our best, Georgino.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was still in queenly costume, except for the ruff.
      Lucia seemed as usual to be quite unconscious of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucia, before you begin--' said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So much better than interrupting,' said Lucia. 'Thank you,
      dear. Yes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About this fête. Oh, for gracious sake don't go on seeming
      to know nothing about it. I tell you there is to be one.
      And it's all nohow. Can't you help us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sprang from the music-stool. She had been waiting for
      this moment, not impatiently, but ready for it if it came,
      as she knew it must, without any scheming on her part. She
      had been watching from Perdita's garden the straggling
      procession smoking cigarettes, the listless halberdiers not
      walking in step, the courtiers yawning in Her Majesty's
      face, the languor and the looseness arising from the lack
      of an inspiring mind. The scene on the <i>Golden Hind,</i>
      and that of Elizabeth's speech to her troops were equally
      familiar to her, for though she could not observe them from
      under her garden-hat close at hand, her husband had been
      fond of astronomy and there were telescopes great and
      small, which brought these scenes quite close. Moreover,
      she had that speech which poor Daisy found so elusive by
      heart. So easy to learn, just the sort of cheap bombast
      that Elizabeth would indulge in: she had found it in a
      small history of England, and had committed it to memory,
      just in case . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I'll willingly help you, dear Daisy,' she said. 'I
      seem to remember you told me something about it. You as
      Queen Elizabeth, was it not, a roast sheep on the <i>Golden
      Hind,</i> a speech to the troops, Morris-dances,
      bear-baiting, no, not bear-baiting. Isn't it all going
      beautifully?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! It isn't,' said Daisy in a lamentable voice. 'I want
      you to help us, will you? It's all like dough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was Lucia. There was no rubbing in: there was no
      hesitation, there was nothing but helpful sunny cordiality
      in response to this SOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How you all work me!' she said, 'but I'll try to help you
      if I can. Georgie, we must put off our practice, and get to
      grips with all this, if the fête is to be a credit to
      Riseholme. <i>Addio, caro Mozartino</i> for the present.
      Now begin, Daisy, and tell me all the trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next week Mozartino and the <i>Symposium</i> and
      Contract Bridge were non-existent and rehearsals went on
      all day. Lucia demonstrated to Daisy how to make her first
      appearance, and, when the trumpeters blew a fanfare, she
      came out of the door of the Hurst, and without the
      slightest hurry majestically marched down the crazy
      pavement. She did not fumble at the gate as Daisy always
      did, but with a swift imperious nod to Robert Quantock,
      which made him pause in the middle of a sneeze, she caused
      him to fly forward, open it, and kneel as she passed
      through. She made a wonderful curtsey to her lieges and
      motioned them to close up in front of her. And all this was
      done in the clothes of today, without a ruff or a pearl to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Something like that, do you think, dear Daisy, for the
      start of the procession?' she said to her. 'Will you try it
      like that and see how it goes? And a little more briskness,
      gentlemen, from the halberdiers. Would you form in front of
      me now, while Mrs Quantock goes into the house . . . Ah,
      that has more snap, hasn't it? Excellent. Quite like
      guardsmen. Piggy and Goosie, my dears, you must remember
      that you are Elizabethan Countesses. Very stately, please,
      and Countesses never giggle. Sweep two low curtsies, and
      while still down pick up the Queen's train. You opened the
      gate very properly, Robert. Very nice indeed. Now may we
      have that all over again. Queen, please,' she called to
      Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy came out of the house in all the panoply of Majesty,
      and with the idea of not hurrying came so slowly that her
      progress resembled that of a queen following a hearse. ('A
      little quicker, dear,' called Lucia encouragingly. 'We're
      all ready.') Then she tripped over a piece of loose crazy
      pavement. Then she sneezed, for she had certainly caught
      Robert's cold. Then she forgot to bow to her lieges, until
      they had closed up in procession in front of her, and then
      bobbed to their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hey ho, nonny, nonny,' sang Lucia to start the chorus.
      'Off we go! Right, left--I beg your pardon, how stupid of
      me--Left, right. Crescendo, choir. Sing out, please. We're
      being Merrie England. Capital!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia walked by the side of the procession across the
      green, beating time with her parasol, full of encouragement
      and enthusiasm. Sometimes she ran on in front and observed
      their progress, sometimes she stood still to watch them go
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Open out a little, halberdiers,' she cried, 'so that we
      can get a glimpse of the Queen from in front. Hey nonny!
      Hold that top G, choir-boys! Queen, dear, don't attempt to
      keep step with the halberdiers. Much more royal to walk as
      you choose. The train a little higher, Piggy and Goosie.
      Hey nonny, nonny HEY!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round as they got near the <i>Golden Hind,</i>
      to see if the cooks were basting the bolster that did duty
      for the sheep, and that Drake's sailors were dancing their
      hornpipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dance, please, sailors,' she shrieked. 'Go on basting,
      cooks, until the procession stops, and then begins the
      chorus of sailors on the last "nonny Hey". Cooks must join
      in, too, or we shan't get enough body of sound. Open out,
      halberdiers, leave plenty of room for the Queen to come
      between you. Slowly, Elizabeth! "When the storm winds blow
      and the surges sweep." Louder! Are you ready, Georgie? No;
      don't come off the <i>Golden Hind.</i> You receive the
      Queen on the deck. A little faster, Elizabeth, the chorus
      will be over before you get here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A moment, please,' she said. 'A wonderful scene. But just
      one suggestion. May I be Queen for a minute and show you
      the effect I want to get, dear Daisy? Let us go back,
      procession, please, twenty yards. Halberdiers still walking
      in front of Queen. Sailors' chorus all over again. Off we
      go! Now, halberdiers, open out. Half right and left turn
      respectively. Two more steps and halt, making an avenue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly timed. Lucia moved forward up the avenue
      of halberdiers, and just as the last 'Yo ho' was yelled by
      cooks, courtiers and sailors, she stepped with
      indescribable majesty on to the deck of the <i>Golden
      Hind.</i> She stood there a moment quite still, and
      whispered to Georgie, 'Kneel and kiss my hand, Georgie.
      Now, everybody together! "God save the Queen". "Hurrah".
      Hats in the air. Louder, louder! Now die away! There!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had been waving her own hat, and shrilly cheering
      herself, and now she again clapped her hands for attention,
      as she scrutinized the deck of the <i>Golden Hind.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I don't see Drake's wife,' she said. 'Drake's wife,
      please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Drake's wife was certainly missing. She was also the
      grocer's wife, and as she had only to come forward for one
      moment, curtsey and disappear, she was rather slack at her
      attendance of rehearsals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It doesn't matter,' said Lucia. 'I'll take Drake's wife,
      just for this rehearsal. Now we must have that over again.
      It's one of the most important moments, this Queen's entry
      on to the <i>Golden Hind.</i> We must make it rich in
      romance, in majesty, in spaciousness. Will the procession,
      please, go back, and do it over again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      This time poor Daisy was much too early. She got to the
      <i>Golden Hind</i> long before the cooks and the chorus
      were ready for her. But there was a murmur of applause when
      Mrs Drake (so soon to be Lady Drake) ran forward and threw
      herself at the Queen's feet in an ecstasy of loyalty, and
      having kissed her hand walked backwards from the Presence
      with head bent low, as if in adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now step to the Queen's left, Georgie,' said Lucia, 'and
      take her left hand, holding it high and lead her to the
      banquet. Daisy dear, you <i>must</i> mind your train. Piggy
      and Goosie will lay it down as you reach the deck, and then
      you must look after it yourself. If you're not careful
      you'll tread on it and fall into the Thames. You've got to
      move so that it follows you when you turn round.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I kick it?' asked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, it can be done without. You must practise that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole company now, sailors, soldiers, courtiers and all
      were eager as dogs are to be taken out for a walk by their
      mistress, and Lucia reluctantly consented to come and look
      at the scene of the review at Tilbury. Possibly some little
      idea, she diffidently said, might occur to her; fresh eyes
      sometimes saw something, and if they all really wanted her
      she was at their disposal. So off they went to the
      rendezvous in front of the Ambermere Arms, and the fresh
      eyes perceived that according to the present grouping of
      soldiers and populace no spectator would see anything of
      the Queen at all. So that was rectified, and the mob was
      drilled to run into its proper places with due eagerness,
      and Lucia sat where the front row of spectators would be to
      hear the great speech. When it was over she warmly
      congratulated the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'm so glad you liked it,' said the Queen. 'Is there
      anything that strikes you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sat for a while in pensive silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just one or two little tiny things, dear,' she said,
      thoughtfully. 'I couldn't hear very well. I wondered
      sometimes what the mob was cheering about. And would it
      perhaps be safer to read the speech? There was a good deal
      of prompting that was quite audible. Of course there are
      disadvantages in reading it. It won't seem so spontaneous
      and inspiring if you consult a paper all the time. Still, I
      dare say you'll get it quite by heart before the time
      comes. Indeed, the only real criticism I have to make is
      about your gestures, your movements. Not quite, quite
      majestic enough, not inspiring enough. Too much as if you
      were whisking flies away. More breadth!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed, she appeared to be lost in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What kind of breadth?' asked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So difficult to explain,' said Lucia. 'You must get more
      variety, more force, both in your gestures and your voice.
      You must be fierce sometimes, the great foe of Spain, you
      must be tender, the mother of your people. You must be a
      Tudor. The daughter of that glorious cad, King Hal. Coarse
      and kingly. Shall I show you for a moment the sort of thing
      I mean? So much easier to show than to explain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy's heart sank: she was full of vague apprehensions.
      But having asked for help, she could hardly refuse this
      generous granting of it, for indeed Lucia was giving up her
      whole morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very good of you,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lend me your copy of the speech, then,' said Lucia, 'and
      might I borrow your ruff, just to encourage myself. Now let
      me read through the speech to myself. Yes . . . yes . . .
      crescendo, and flare up then . . . pause again; a touch of
      tenderness . . . Well, as you insist on it I'll try to show
      you what I mean. Terribly nervous, though.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia advanced and spoke in the most ingratiating tones to
      her army and the mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please have patience with me, ladies and gentlemen,' she
      said, 'while I go through the speech once more. Wonderful
      words, aren't they? I know I shan't do them justice. Let me
      see: the palfrey with the Queen will come out from the
      garden of the Ambermere Arms, will it not? Then will the
      whole mob, please, hurry into the garden and then come out
      romping and cheering and that sort of thing in front of me.
      When I get to where the table is, that is to say, where the
      palfrey will stand as I make my speech, some of the mob
      must fall back, and the rest sit on the grass, so that the
      spectators may see. Now, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia stalked in from the garden, joining the mob now and
      then to show them how to gambol, and nimbly vaulted (thanks
      to callisthenics) on to the table on which was the chair
      where she sat on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with a great sweep of her arm she began to speak. The
      copy of the speech which she carried flew out of her hand,
      but that made no difference, for she had it all by heart,
      and without pause, except for the bursts of cheering from
      the mob, when she pointed at them, she declaimed it all,
      her voice now rising, now falling, now full of fire, now
      tender and motherly. Then she got down from the table, and
      passed along the line of her troops, beckoned to the
      mob--which in the previous scene had been cooks and sailors
      and all sorts of things--to close up behind her with shouts
      and cheers and gambollings, and went off down the garden
      path again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That sort of thing, dear Daisy, don't you think?' she said
      to the Queen, returning her ruff. 'So crude and awkwardly
      done I know, but perhaps that may be the way to put a
      little life into it. Ah, there's your copy of the speech.
      Quite familiar to me, I found. I dare say I learned it when
      I was at school. Now, I really must be off. I wish I could
      think that I had been any use.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Lucia was too busy to superintend the
      rehearsal: she was sure that Daisy would manage it
      beautifully, and she was indeed very busy watching through
      a field-glass in the music-room the muddled and anaemic
      performance. The halberdiers strolled along with their
      hands in their pockets. Piggy and Goosie sat down on the
      grass, and Daisy knew less of her speech than ever. The
      collective consciousness of Riseholme began to be aware
      that nothing could be done without Lucia, and
      conspiratorial groups conferred stealthily, dispersing or
      dropping their voices as Queen Elizabeth approached and
      forming again when she had gone by. The choir which had
      sung so convincingly when Lucia was there with her loud
      'Hey nonny nonny', never bothered about the high G at all,
      but simply left it out; the young Elizabethans who had
      gambolled like intoxicated lambkins under her stimulating
      eye sat down and chewed daisies; the cooks never attempted
      to baste the bolster; and the Queen's speech to her troops
      was received with the most respectful tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, in Drake's shoes which were becoming less
      agonizing with use, lunched with Colonel and Mrs Boucher.
      Mrs Boucher was practically the only Riseholmite who was
      taking no part in the fête, because her locomotion was
      confined to the wheels of a bath-chair. But she attended
      every rehearsal and had views which were as strong as her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may like it or not,' she said very emphatically, 'but
      the only person who can pull you through is Lucia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody can pull poor Daisy through,' said Georgie.
      'Hopeless!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what I mean,' said she. 'If Lucia isn't the Queen,
      I say give it all up. Poor Daisy's bitten off, if you won't
      misunderstand me, as we're all such friends of hers, more
      than she can chew. My kitchen-cat, and I don't care who
      knows it, would make a better Queen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But Lucia's going off to Tilling, next week,' said
      Georgie. 'She won't be here even.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, beg and implore her not to desert Riseholme,' said
      Mrs Boucher. 'Why, everybody was muttering about it this
      morning, army and navy and all. It was like a revolution.
      There was Mrs Antrobus; she said to me, "Oh dear, oh dear,
      it will never do at all," and there was poor Daisy standing
      close beside her; and we all turned red. Most awkward. And
      it's up to you, Georgie, to go down on your knees to Lucia
      and say "Save Riseholme!" There!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she refused to have anything to do with it, after
      Daisy asked her to be my wife,' said Georgie Drake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naturally she would be most indignant. An insult. But you
      and Daisy must implore her. Perhaps she could go to Tilling
      and settle herself in and then come back for the fête, for
      she doesn't need any rehearsals. She could act every part
      herself if she could be a crowd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marvellous woman!' said Colonel Boucher. 'Every word of
      the Queen's speech by heart, singing with the choir,
      basting with the cooks, dancing with the sailors. That's
      what I call instinct, eh? You'd have thought she had been
      studying it all the time. I agree with my wife, Georgie.
      The difficulty is Daisy. <i>Would</i> she give it up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She did say that she felt inclined to chuck the whole
      thing, a few days ago,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There you are, then,' said Mrs Boucher. 'Remind her of
      what she said. You and she go to Lucia before you waste
      time over another rehearsal without her, and implore her.
      Implore! I shouldn't a bit wonder if she said yes. Indeed,
      if you ask me, I believe that she's been keeping out of it
      all until you saw you couldn't do without her. Then she
      came to help at a rehearsal, and you all saw what you could
      do when she was there. Why, I burst out cheering myself
      when she said she had the heart of a Prince. Then she
      retires again as she did this morning, and more than ever
      you see you can't do without her. I say she's waiting to be
      asked. It would be like her, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was an illuminating thought; it certainly seemed
      tremendously like Lucia at her very best.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you're right. She's cleverer than all of us put
      together,' said Georgie. 'I shall go over to Daisy at once
      and sound her. Thank God, my shoes are better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gloomy queen that Georgie found, a Queen of Sheba
      with no spirit left in her, but only a calmness of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It went worse than ever this morning,' she remarked. 'And
      I dare say we've not touched bottom yet. Georgie, what is
      to be done?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more delicate to give Daisy the chance of abdicating
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure I don't know,' said he. 'But something's got to
      be done. I wish I could think what.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was rent with pangs of jealousy and of consciousness
      of her supreme impotence. She took half a glass of port,
      which her regime told her was deadly poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie! Do you think there's the slightest chance of
      getting Lucia to be the Queen and managing the whole
      affair?' she asked quaveringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We might try,' said Georgie. 'The Bouchers are for it, and
      everybody else as well, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, come quick then, or I may repent,' said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had seen them coming, and sat down at her piano. She
      had not time to open her music, and so began the first
      movement of the 'Moonlight' Sonata.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, how nice!' she said. 'Georgie, I'm going to practise
      all afternoon. Poor fingers so rusty! And did you have a
      lovely rehearsal this morning? Speech going well, Daisy?
      I'm sure it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Couldn't remember a word,' said Daisy. 'Lucia, we all want
      to turn the whole thing over to you, Queen and all. Will
      you--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, Lucia,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked from one to the other in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, dear things, how can I?' she said. 'I shan't be here
      to begin with, I shall be at Tilling. And then all the
      trouble you've been taking, Daisy. I couldn't. Impossible.
      Cruel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can't do it at all without you,' said Daisy firmly. 'So
      that's impossible too. Please, Lucia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia seemed quite bewildered by these earnest entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't you come back for the fête?' said Georgie. 'Rehearse
      all day, every day, till the end of the month. Then go to
      Tilling, and you and I will return just for the week of the
      fête.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia seemed to be experiencing a dreadful struggle with
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie, dear Daisy, you're asking a great sacrifice
      of me,' she said. 'I had planned my days here so carefully.
      My music, my Dante: all my lessons! I shall have to give
      them all up, you know, if I'm to get this fête into any
      sort of shape. No time for anything else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A miserable two-part fugue of 'Please, Lucia. It's the only
      chance. We can't do it unless you're Queen,' suddenly burst
      into the happy strains of 'It is good of you. Oh, thank
      you, Lucia,' and the day was won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly she became extremely business-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No time to waste then,' she said. 'Let us have a full
      rehearsal at three, and after that I'll take the
      Morris-dancers and the halberdiers. You and Georgie must be
      my lieutenants, dear Daisy. We shall all have to pull
      together. By the way, what will you be now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever you like,' said Daisy recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked at her fixedly with that gimlet eye, as if
      appraising, at their highest, her possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then let us see, dear Daisy,' she said, 'what you can make
      of Drake's wife. Quite a short part, I know, but so
      important. You have to get into that one moment all the
      loyalty, all the devotion of the women of England to the
      Queen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us begin working at once,' she said. 'This is the
      <i>Golden Hind:</i> I have just stepped on to it. Now go
      behind the piano, and then come tripping out, full of awe,
      full of reverence . . . Oh, dear me, that will never do.
      Shall I act it for you once more? . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

          id="c04">CHAPTER 4</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had come back to Tilling last night from the fêteful
      week at Riseholme, and she was sitting next morning after
      breakfast at the window of the garden-room in Miss Mapp's
      house. It was a magic casement to anyone who was interested
      in life, as Lucia certainly was, and there was a tide every
      morning in the affairs of Tilling which must be taken at
      the flood. Mrs Wyse's Royce had lurched down the street,
      Diva had come out with her market-basket from quaint
      Irene's house, of which she was now the tenant, Miss Mapp's
      (she was already by special request 'Elizabeth') gardener
      had wheeled off to the greengrocer his daily barrowful of
      garden-produce. Elizabeth had popped in to welcome her on
      her return from Riseholme and congratulate her on the fête
      of which the daily illustrated papers had been so full,
      and, strolling about the garden with her, had absently
      picked a few roses (Diva's had green fly); the Padre
      passing by the magic casement had wished her good morrow,
      Mistress Lucas, and finally Major Benjy had come out of his
      house on the way to catch the tram to the golf-links. Lucia
      called <i>'Quai-hai'</i> to him in silvery tones, for they
      had made great friends in the days she had already spent at
      Tilling, and reminded him that he was dining with her that
      night. With great gallantry he had taken off his cap, and
      bawled out that this wasn't the sort of engagement he was
      in any danger of forgetting, au reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide had ebbed now, and Lucia left the window. There
      was so much to think about that she hardly knew where to
      begin. First her eyes fell on the piano which was no longer
      the remarkable Blumenfelt belonging to Elizabeth on which
      she had been granted the privilege to play, but one which
      she had hired from Brighton. No doubt it was quite true
      that, as Elizabeth had said, her Blumenfelt had been
      considered a very fine instrument, but nobody, for the last
      twenty years or so, could have considered it anything but a
      remarkable curiosity. Some notes sounded like the chirping
      of canaries (Diva's canary was quite well again after its
      pip), others did not sound at all, and the <i>sostenuto</i>
      pedal was a thing of naught. So Lucia had hired a new
      piano, and had put the canary-piano in the little
      telephone-room off the hall. It filled it up, but it was
      still possible to telephone if you went in sideways.
      Elizabeth had shown traces of acidity about this when she
      discovered the substitution, and had rather pensively
      remarked that her piano had belonged to her dearest mamma,
      and she hoped the telephone-room wasn't damp. It seemed
      highly probable that it had been her mother's if not her
      grandmother's, but after all Lucia had not promised to play
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the piano. There lay on it now a china bowl
      full of press-cuttings, and Lucia glanced at a few,
      recalling the triumphs of the past week. The fête, favoured
      by brilliant weather and special trains from Worcester and
      Gloucester and Birmingham, had been a colossal success. The
      procession had been cinematographed, so too had the scene
      on the <i>Golden Hind</i> and the click of cameras
      throughout the whole performance had been like the noise of
      cicadas in the south. The Hurst had been the target for
      innumerable lenses (Lucia was most indulgent) and she was
      photographed at her piano and in Perdita's garden and
      musing in an arbour, as Queen Elizabeth and as herself, and
      (she had got one of those artists to take, rather
      reluctantly) a special photograph of Drake's poor wife.
      That had not been a success, for Daisy had moved, but
      Lucia's intention was of the kindest. And throughout, to
      photographers and interviewers alike, Lucia (knowing that
      nobody would believe it) had insisted that all the credit
      was due to Drake's wife, who had planned everything (or
      nearly) and had done all the spade-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had nearly been one dreadful disaster. In fact there
      had been the disaster, but the amazing Lucia, quite
      impromptu, had wrung a fresh personal triumph out of it. It
      was on the last day of the fête, when the green would
      hardly contain the influx of visitors, and another tier of
      benches had been put up round the pond where the <i>Golden
      Hind</i> lay, that this excruciating moment had occurred.
      Queen Elizabeth had just left the deck where she had
      feasted on a plateful of kippered cinders, and the
      procession was escorting her away, when the whole of the
      stern of the <i>Golden Hind,</i> on which was the fire and
      the previously roasted sheep and a mast, streaming with
      ancients and the crowd of cheering cooks, broke off, and
      with a fearful splash and hiss fell into the water. Before
      anyone could laugh, Lucia (remembering that the water was
      only three feet deep at the most and so there was no danger
      of anyone drowning) broke into a ringing cry. 'Zounds and
      Zooks,' she shouted. 'Thus will I serve the damned galleons
      of Spain,' and with a magnificent gesture of disdain at the
      cooks standing waist-high in the water, she swept on with
      her procession. The reporters singled out for special
      notice this wonderful piece of symbolism. A few of the most
      highbrow deemed it not quite legitimate business, but none
      questioned the superb dramatic effect of the device, for it
      led on with such perfect fitness to the next topic, namely
      the coming of the Armada. The cooks waded ashore, rushed
      home to change their clothes, and were in time to take
      their places in the mob that escorted her white palfrey.
      Who would mind a ducking in the service of such a
      resourceful Queen? Of all Lucia's triumphs during the week
      that inspired moment was the crown, and she could not help
      wondering what poor Daisy would have done, if she had been
      on the throne that day. Probably she would have said: 'Oh
      dear, oh dear, they've all fallen into the water. We must
      stop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Riseholme was proud of Lucia, and Tilling which
      had been greedily devouring the picture papers was proud
      too. There was one possible exception, she thought, and
      that was Elizabeth, who in her visit of welcome just now
      had said, 'How dreadful all this publicity must be for you,
      dear! How you must shrink from it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lucia, as usual, had been quite up to the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet of you to be so sympathetic, Elizabeth,' she had
      said. 'But it was my duty to help dear Riseholme, and I
      mustn't regard the consequences to myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That put the lid on Elizabeth: she said no more about the
      fête.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, as these random thoughts suggested by that stack of
      press-cuttings flitted through her brain, felt that she
      would have soon to bring it to bear on Elizabeth, for she
      was becoming something of a problem. But first, for this
      was an immediate concern, she must concentrate on Georgie.
      Georgie at the present moment, unconscious of his doom, and
      in a state of the highest approbation with life generally,
      was still at Riseholme, for Adele Brixton's brother,
      Colonel Cresswell, had taken his house for two months and
      there were many bits of things, embroidery and sketches and
      little bottles with labels, 'For outward application only',
      which he must put away. He had been staying with Daisy for
      the fête, for Foljambe and the rest of his staff had come
      to Tilling at the beginning of August and it was not worth
      while taking them all back, though it would be difficult to
      get on without Foljambe for a week. Then he had stopped on
      for this extra day with Daisy after the fête was over, to
      see that everything was tidy and discreet and Lucia
      expected him back this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had very upsetting news for him: ghastly in fact. The
      vague rumours which had been rife at Riseholme were all too
      true, and Cadman, her chauffeur, had come to Lucia last
      night with the bomb-shell that he and Foljambe were
      thinking of getting married. She had seen Foljambe as well,
      and Foljambe had begged her to break the news to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should take it very kind of you, ma'am, if you would,'
      Foljambe had said, 'for I know I could never bring myself
      to do it, and he wouldn't like to feel that I had made up
      my mind without telling him. We're in no hurry, me and
      Cadman, we shouldn't think of being married till after we
      got back to Riseholme in the autumn, and that'll give Mr
      Georgie several months to get suited. I'm sure you'll make
      him see it the right way, if anybody can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This handsome tribute to her tact had had its due weight,
      and Lucia had promised to be the messenger of these dismal
      tidings. Georgie would arrive in time for lunch to-day, and
      she was determined to tell him at once. But it was dreadful
      to think of poor Georgie on his way now, full of the
      pleasantest anticipations for the future (since Foljambe
      had expressed herself more than pleased with her bedroom)
      and rosy with the remarkable success of his Drake, and the
      very substantial rent for which he had let his house for
      two months, with this frightful blow so soon to be dealt
      him by her hand. Lucia had no idea how he would take it,
      except that he was certain to be terribly upset. So,
      leaving the garden-room and establishing herself in the
      pleasant shade on the lawn outside, she thought out quite a
      quantity of bracing and valuable reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her thoughts towards Elizabeth Mapp. During
      those ten days before Lucia had gone to Riseholme for the
      fête, she had popped in every single day: it was quite
      obvious that Elizabeth was keeping her eye on her. She
      always had some glib excuse: she wanted a hot-water bottle,
      or a thimble or a screw-driver that she had forgotten to
      take away, and declining all assistance would go to look
      for them herself, feeling sure that she could put her hand
      on them instantly without troubling anybody. She would go
      into the kitchen wreathed in smiles and pleasant
      observations for Lucia's cook, she would pop into the
      servants' hall and say something agreeable to Cadman, and
      pry into cupboards to find what she was in search of. (It
      was during one of these expeditions that she had discovered
      her dearest mamma's piano in the telephone-room.) Often she
      came in without knocking or ringing the bell, and then if
      Lucia or Grosvenor heard her clandestine entry, and came to
      see who it was, she scolded herself for her stupidity in
      not remembering that for the present, this was not her
      house. So forgetful of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of these occasions she had popped out into the
      garden, and found Lucia eating a fig from the tree that
      grew against the garden-room, and was covered with fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh you dear thief!' she said. 'What about garden-produce?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing Lucia's look of blank amazement, she had given
      a pretty peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lulu, dear! Only my joke,' she cried. 'Poking a little fun
      at Queen Elizabeth. You may eat every fig in my garden, and
      I wish there were more of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion Elizabeth had found Major Benjy having
      tea with Lucia, and she had said, 'Oh, how disappointed I
      am! I had so hoped to introduce you to each other, and now
      someone else has taken that treat from me. Who was the
      naughty person?' But perhaps that was a joke too. Lucia was
      not quite sure that she liked Elizabeth's jokes, any more
      than she liked her informal visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, Lucia cast an eye over her garden. The lawn
      badly wanted cutting, the flower-beds wanted weeding, the
      box-edgings to them wanted clipping, and it struck her that
      the gardener, whose wages she paid, could not have done an
      hour's work here since she left. He was never in this part
      of the garden at all, she seemed to remember, but was
      always picking fruit and vegetables in the kitchen-garden,
      or digging over the asparagus-bed, or potting
      chrysanthemums, or doing other jobs that did not concern
      her own interests but Elizabeth's. There he was now, a nice
      genial man, preparing a second basketful of garden-produce
      to take to the greengrocer's, from whom eventually Lucia
      bought it. An inquiry must instantly be held.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Coplen,' she said. 'I want you to cut the
      lawn to-day. It's got dreadfully long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very sorry, ma'am,' said he. 'I don't think I can find
      time to-day myself. I could get a man in perhaps to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should prefer that you should,' said Lucia. 'You can get
      a man in to pick those vegetables.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's not only them,' he said. 'Miss Mapp she told me to
      manure the strawberry-beds to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what has Miss Mapp got to do with it?' said she.
      'You're in my employment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that does only seem fair,' said the impartial
      Coplen. 'But you see, ma'am, my orders are to go to Miss
      Mapp every morning and she tells me what she wants done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then for the future please come to me every morning and
      see what I want done,' she said. 'Finish what you're at
      now, and then start on the lawn at once. Tell Miss Mapp by
      all means that I've given you these instructions. And no
      strawberry-bed shall be manured to-day, nor indeed until my
      garden looks less like a tramp who hasn't shaved for a
      week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported by an impregnable sense of justice but still
      dangerously fuming, Lucia went back to her garden-room, to
      tranquillize herself with an hour's practice on the new
      piano. Very nice tone; she and Georgie would be able to
      start their musical hours again now. This afternoon,
      perhaps, if he felt up to it after the tragic news, a duet
      might prove tonic. Not a note had she played during that
      triumphant week at Riseholme. Scales first then, and
      presently she was working away at a new Mozart, which she
      and Georgie would subsequently read over together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a tap at the door of the garden-room. It opened
      a chink, and Elizabeth in her sweetest voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I pop in once more, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was out of breath. She had hurried up from the
      High Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So sorry to interrupt your sweet music, <i>Lucia mia,'</i>
      she said. 'What a pretty tune! What fingers you have! But
      my good Coplen has come to me in great perplexity. So much
      better to clear it up at once, I thought, so I came
      instantly though rather rushed to-day. A little
      misunderstanding, no doubt. Coplen is not clever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth seemed to be labouring under some excitement
      which might account for this loss of wind. So Lucia waited
      till she was more controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--And your new piano, dear?' asked Elizabeth. 'You like
      it? It sounded so sweet, though not quite the tone of
      dearest mamma's. About Coplen then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, about Coplen,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He misunderstood, I am sure, what you said to him just
      now. So distressed he was. Afraid I should be vexed with
      him. I said I would come to see you and make it all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing easier, dear,' said Lucia. 'We can put it all
      right in a minute. He told me he had not time to cut the
      lawn today because he had to manure your strawberry-beds,
      and I said "The lawn please, at once," or words to that
      effect. He didn't quite grasp, I think, that he's in my
      employment, so naturally I reminded him of it. He
      understands now, I hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked rather rattled at these energetic remarks,
      and Lucia saw at once that this was the stuff to give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my garden-produce, you know, dear Lulu,' said
      Elizabeth. 'It is not much use to me if all those beautiful
      pears are left to rot on the trees till the wasps eat
      them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt that is so,' said Lucia; 'but Coplen, whose wages
      I pay, is no use to me if he spends his entire time in
      looking after your garden-produce. I pay for his time, dear
      Elizabeth, and I intend to have it. He also told me he took
      his orders every morning from you. That won't do at all. I
      shan't permit that for a moment. If I had engaged your cook
      as well as your gardener, I should not allow her to spend
      her day in roasting mutton for you. So that's all settled.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was borne in upon Elizabeth that she hadn't got a leg to
      stand upon and she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lulu,' she said, 'anything would be better than that I
      should have a misunderstanding with such a dear as you are.
      I won't argue, I won't put my point of view at all. I
      yield. There! If you can spare Coplen for an hour in the
      morning to take my little fruits and vegetables to the
      greengrocer's I should be glad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite impossible, I'm afraid, dear Elizabeth,' said Lucia
      with the greatest cordiality. 'Coplen has been neglecting
      the flower-garden dreadfully, and for the present it will
      take him all his time to get it tidy again. You must get
      someone else to do that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked quite awful for a moment: then her face
      was wreathed in smiles again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Precious one!' she said. 'It shall be exactly as you wish.
      Now I must run away. Au reservoir. You're not free, I
      suppose, this evening to have a little dinner with me? I
      would ask Major Benjy to join us, and our beloved Diva, who
      has a passion, positively a passion for you. Major Benjy
      indeed too. He raves about you. Wicked woman, stealing all
      the hearts of Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt positively sorry for the poor thing. Before she
      left for Riseholme last week, she had engaged Diva and
      Major Benjy to dine with her to-night, and it was quite
      incredible that Elizabeth, by this time, should not have
      known that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet of you,' she said, 'but I have a tiny little party
      myself to-night. Just one or two, dropping in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth lingered a moment yet, and Lucia said to herself
      that the thumb-screw and the rack would not induce her to
      ask Elizabeth, however long she lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and she exchanged kissings of the hand as Elizabeth
      emerged from the front door, and tripped down the street.
      'I see I must be a little firm with her,' thought Lucia,
      'and when I've taught her her place, then it will be time
      to be kind. But I won't ask her to dinner just yet. She
      must learn not to ask me when she knows I'm engaged. And
      she shall not pop in without ringing. I must tell Grosvenor
      to put the door on the chain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia returned to her practice, but shovelled the new
      Mozart out of sight, when, in one of her glances out of the
      open window, she observed Georgie coming up the street, on
      his way from the station. He had a light and airy step,
      evidently he was in the best of spirits and he waved to her
      as he caught sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just going to look in at the cottage one second,' he
      called out, 'to see that everything's all right, and then
      I'll come and have a chat before lunch. Heaps to tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So have I,' said Lucia, ruefully thinking what one of
      those things was. 'Hurry up, Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He tripped along up to the cottage, and Lucia's heart was
      wrung for him, for all that gaiety would soon suffer a
      total eclipse, and she was to be the darkener of his day.
      Had she better tell him instantly, she wondered, or hear
      his news first, and outline the recent Manoeuvres of Mapp.
      These exciting topics might prove tonic, something to fall
      back on afterwards. Whereas, if she stabbed him straight
      away, they would be of no service as restoratives. Also
      there was stewed lobster for lunch, and Georgie who adored
      it would probably not care a bit about it if the blow fell
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie began to speak almost before he opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All quite happy at the cottage,' he said, 'and Foljambe
      ever so pleased with Tilling. Everything in spick-and-span
      order and my paint-box cleaned up and the hole in the
      carpet mended quite beautifully. She must have been busy
      while I was away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ('Dear, oh dear, she has,' thought Lucia.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'And everything settled at Riseholme,' continued poor
      Georgie. 'Colonel Cresswell wants my house for three
      months, so I said yes, and now we're both homeless for
      October, unless we keep on our houses here. I had to put on
      my Drake clothes again yesterday, for the <i>Birmingham
      Gazette</i> wanted to photograph me. My dear, what a huge
      success it all was, but I'm glad to get away, for
      everything will be as flat as ditchwater now, all except
      Daisy. She began to buck up at once the moment you left,
      and I positively heard her say how quickly you picked up
      the part of the Queen after watching her once or twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! Poor thing!' said Lucia with deep compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now tell me all about Tilling,' said Georgie, feeling he
      must play fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Things are beginning to move, Georgie,' said she,
      forgetting for the time the impending tragedy.
      'Night-marches, Georgie, manoeuvres. Elizabeth, of course.
      I'm sure I was right, she wants to run me, and if she can't
      (if!) she'll try to fight me. I can see glimpses of hatred
      and malice in her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you'll fight her?' asked Georgie eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing of the kind, my dear,' said Lucia. 'What do you
      take me for? Every now and then, when necessary, I shall
      just give her two or three hard slaps. I gave her one this
      morning: I did indeed. Not a very hard one, but it stung.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! Do tell me,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a short but perfectly accurate description of
      the gardener-crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I stopped that,' she said, 'and there are several other
      things I shall stop. I won't have her, for instance,
      walking into my house without ringing. So I've told
      Grosvenor to put up the chain. And she calls me Lulu which
      makes me sick. Nobody's ever called me Lulu and they shan't
      begin now. I must see if calling her Liblib will do the
      trick. And then she asked me to dinner to-night, when she
      must have known perfectly well that Major Benjy and Diva
      are dining with me. You're dining too, by the way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not sure if I'd better,' said Georgie. 'I think
      Foljambe might expect me to dine at home the first night I
      get back. I know she wants to go through the linen and
      plate with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Georgie, quite unnecessary,' said she. 'I want you to
      help me to give the others a jolly comfortable evening.
      We'll play bridge and let Major Benjy lay down the law.
      We'll have a genial evening, make them enjoy it. And
      to-morrow I shall ask the Wyses and talk about Countesses.
      And the day after I shall ask the Padre and his wife and
      talk Scotch. I want you to come every night. It's new in
      Tilling I find, to give little dinners. Tea is the usual
      entertainment. And I shan't ask Liblib at all till next
      week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my dear, isn't that war?' asked Georgie. (It did look
      rather like it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not the least. It's benevolent neutrality. We shall see if
      she learns sense. If she does, I shall be very nice to her
      again and ask her to several pleasant little parties. I am
      giving her every chance. Also Georgie . . .' Lucia's eyes
      assumed that gimlet-like expression which betokened an
      earnest purpose, 'I want to understand her and be fair to
      her. At present I can't understand her. The idea of her
      giving orders to a gardener to whom I give wages! But
      that's all done with. I can hear the click of the
      mowing-machine on the lawn now. Just two or three things I
      won't stand. I won't be patronized by Liblib, and I won't
      be called Lulu, and I won't have her popping in and out of
      my house like a cuckoo clock.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch drew to an end. There was Georgie looking so
      prosperous and plump, with his chestnut-coloured hair no
      longer in the least need of a touch of dye, and his
      beautiful clothes. Already Major Benjy, who had quickly
      seen that if he wanted to be friends with Lucia he must be
      friends with Georgie too, had pronounced him to be the
      best-dressed man in Tilling, and Lucia, who invariably
      passed on dewdrops of this kind, had caused Georgie the
      deepest gratification by repeating this. And now she was
      about to plunge a dagger in his heart. She put her elbows
      on the table, so as to be ready to lay a hand of sympathy
      on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, I've got something to tell you,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure I shall like it,' said he. 'Go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, you won't like it at all,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It flashed through his mind that Lucia had changed her mind
      about marrying him, but it could not be that, for she would
      never have said he wouldn't like it at all. Then he had a
      flash of intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Something about Foljambe,' he said in a quavering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She and Cadman are going to marry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie turned on her a face from which all other
      expression except hopeless despair had vanished, and her
      hand of sympathy descended on his, firmly pressing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When?' he said, after moistening his dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not for the present. Not till we get back to Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie pushed away his untasted coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the most dreadful thing that's ever happened to me,'
      he said. 'It's quite spoiled all my pleasure. I didn't
      think Foljambe was so selfish. She's been with me fifteen
      years, and now she goes and breaks up my home like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, that's rather an excessive statement,' said
      Lucia. 'You can get another parlourmaid. There are others.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you come to that, Cadman could get another wife,' said
      Georgie, 'and there isn't another parlourmaid like
      Foljambe. I have suspected something now and then, but I
      never thought it would come to this. What a fool I was to
      leave her here when I went back to Riseholme for the fête!
      Or if only we had driven back there with Cadman instead of
      going by train. It was madness. Here they were with nothing
      to do but make plans behind our backs. No one will ever
      look after my clothes as she does. And the silver. You'll
      miss Cadman, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but I don't think he means to leave me,' said Lucia in
      some alarm. 'What makes you think that? He said nothing
      about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then perhaps Foljambe doesn't mean to leave me,' said
      Georgie, seeing a possible dawn on the wreck of his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's rather different,' said Lucia. 'She'll have to look
      after his house, you see, by day, and then at night
      he'd--he'd like her to be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Horrible to think of,' said Georgie bitterly. 'I wonder
      what she can see in him. I've got a good mind to go and
      live in an hotel. And I had left her five hundred pounds in
      my will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, that was very generous of you. Very,' put in
      Lucia, though Georgie would not feel the loss of that large
      sum after he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But now I shall certainly add a codicil to say "if still
      in my service",' said Georgie rather less generously. 'I
      didn't think it of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was silent a moment. Georgie was taking it very much
      to heart indeed, and she racked her ingenious brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got an idea,' she said at length. 'I don't know if it
      can be worked, but we might see. Would you feel less
      miserable about it if Foljambe would consent to come over
      to your house say at nine in the morning and be there till
      after dinner? If you were dining out as you so often are,
      she could go home earlier. You see Cadman's at the Hurst
      all day, for he does odd jobs as well, and his cottage at
      Riseholme is quite close to your house. You would have to
      give them a charwoman to do the housework.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that is a good idea,' said Georgie, cheering up a
      little. 'Of course I'll give her a charwoman or anything
      else she wants if she'll only look after me as before. She
      can sleep wherever she likes. Of course there may be
      periods when she'll have to be away, but I shan't mind that
      as long as I know she's coming back. Besides, she's rather
      old for that, isn't she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no use counting the babies before they were born,
      and Lucia glided along past this slightly indelicate
      subject with Victorian eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's worth while seeing if she'll stay with you on these
      terms,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather. I shall suggest it at once,' said Georgie. 'I
      think I shall congratulate her very warmly, and say how
      pleased I am, and then ask her. Or would it be better to be
      very cold and preoccupied and not talk to her at all? She'd
      hate that, and then when I ask her after some days whether
      she'll stop on with me, she might promise anything to see
      me less unhappy again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not quite approve of this Machiavellian policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the other hand, it might make her marry Cadman
      instantly, in order to have done with you,' she suggested.
      'You'd better be careful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll think it over,' said Georgie. 'Perhaps it would be
      safer to be very nice to her about it and appeal to her
      better nature, if she's got one. But I know I shall never
      manage to call her Cadman. She must keep her maiden name,
      like an actress.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia duly put in force her disciplinary measures for the
      reduction of Elizabeth. Major Benjy, Diva and Georgie dined
      with her that night, and there was a plate of nougat
      chocolates for Diva, whose inordinate passion for them was
      known all over Tilling, and a fiery curry for the Major to
      remind him of India, and a dish of purple figs bought at
      the greengrocer's but plucked from the tree outside the
      garden-room. She could not resist giving Elizabeth ever so
      gentle a little slap over this, and said that it was rather
      a roundabout process to go down to the High Street to buy
      the figs which Coplen plucked from the tree in the garden,
      and took down with other garden-produce to the shop: she
      must ask dear Elizabeth to allow her to buy them, so to
      speak, at the pit-mouth. But she was genuinely astonished
      at the effect this little joke had on Diva. Hastily she
      swallowed a nougat chocolate entire and turned bright red.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But doesn't Elizabeth give you garden-produce?' she asked
      in an incredulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no,' said Lucia, 'Just flowers for the house. Nothing
      else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I never!' said Diva. 'I fully understood, at least I
      thought I did--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia got up. She must be magnanimous and encourage no
      public exposure, whatever it might be, of Elizabeth's
      conduct, but for the pickling of the rod of discipline she
      would like to hear about it quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's go into the garden-room and have a chat,' she said.
      'Look after Major Benjy, Georgie, and don't sit too long in
      bachelordom, for I must have a little game of bridge with
      him. I'm terribly frightened of him, but he and Mrs
      Plaistow must be kind to beginners like you and me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The indignant Diva poured out her tale of Elizabeth's
      iniquities in a turgid flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So like Elizabeth,' she said. 'I asked her if she gave you
      garden-produce, and she said she wasn't going to dig up her
      potatoes and carry them away. Well, of course I thought
      that meant she did give it you. So like her. Bismarck,
      wasn't it, who told the truth in order to deceive? And so
      of course I gave her my garden-produce and she's selling
      one and eating the other. I wish I'd known I ought to have
      distrusted her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia smiled that indulgent Sunday-evening smile which
      meant she was thinking hard on week-day subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like Elizabeth so much,' she said, 'and what do a few
      figs matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but she always scores,' said Diva, 'and sometimes it's
      hard to bear. She got my house with garden-produce thrown
      in for eight guineas a week and she lets her own without
      garden-produce for twelve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No dear, I pay fifteen,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva stared at her open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it was down in Woolgar's books at twelve,' she said.
      'I saw it myself. She is a one: isn't she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia maintained her attitude of high nobility, but this
      information added a little more pickling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Elizabeth!' she said. 'So glad that she was sharp
      enough to get a few more guineas, I expect she's very
      clever, isn't she? And here come the gentlemen. Now for a
      jolly little game of bridge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was astonished at Lucia. She was accustomed to lay
      down the law with considerable firmness, and instruct
      partners and opponents alike, but to-night a most unusual
      humility possessed her. She was full of diffidence about
      her own skill and of praise for her partner's: she sought
      advice, even once asking Georgie what she ought to have
      played, though that was clearly a mistake, for next moment
      she rated him. But for the other two she had nothing but
      admiring envy at their declarations and their management of
      the hand, and when Diva revoked she took all the blame on
      herself for not having asked her whether her hand was bare
      of the suit. Rubber after rubber they played in an amity
      hitherto unknown in the higher gambling circles of Tilling;
      and when, long after the incredible hour of twelve had
      struck, it was found on the adjustment of accounts that
      Lucia was the universal loser, she said she had never
      bought experience so cheaply and pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy wiped the foam of his third (surreptitious and
      hastily consumed) whisky and soda from his
      walrus-moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most agreeable evening of bridge I've ever spent in
      Tilling,' he said. 'Bless me, when I think of the scoldings
      I've had in this room for some little slip, and the
      friction there's been . . . Mrs Plaistow knows what I
      mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should think I did,' said Diva, beginning to simmer
      again at the thought of garden-produce. 'Poor Elizabeth!
      Lessons in self-control are what she wants and after that a
      few lessons on the elements of the game wouldn't be amiss.
      Then it would be time to think about telling other people
      how to play.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This very pleasant party broke up, and Georgie, hurrying
      home to Mallards Cottage, thought he could discern in these
      comments the key to Lucia's unwonted humility at the
      card-table. For herself she had only kind words on the
      subject of Elizabeth as befitted a large-hearted woman, but
      Diva and Major Benjy could hardly help contrasting
      brilliantly to her advantage, the charming evening they had
      spent with the vituperative scenes which usually took place
      when they played bridge in the garden-room. 'I think Lucia
      has begun,' thought Georgie to himself as he went
      noiselessly upstairs so as not to disturb the slumbers of
      Foljambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was known, of course, all over Tilling the next morning
      that there had been a series of most harmonious rubbers of
      bridge last night at Mallards till goodness knew what hour,
      for Diva spent half the morning in telling everybody about
      it, and the other half in advising them not to get their
      fruit and vegetables at the shop which dealt in the
      garden-produce of the Bismarckian Elizabeth. Equally well
      known was it that the Wyses were dining at Mallards
      to-night, for Mrs Wyse took care of that, and at eight
      o'clock that evening the Royce started from Porpoise
      Street, and arrived at Mallards at precisely one minute
      past. Georgie came on foot from the Cottage thirty yards
      away in the other direction, in the highest spirits, for
      Foljambe after consultation with her Cadman had settled to
      continue on day-duty after the return to Riseholme. So
      Georgie did not intend at present to execute that
      vindictive codicil to his will. He told the Wyses whom he
      met on the doorstep of Mallards about the happy termination
      of this domestic crisis, while Mrs Wyse took off her sables
      and disclosed the fact that she was wearing the order of
      the MBE on her ample bosom; and he observed that Mr Wyse
      had a soft crinkly shirt with a low collar, and velveteen
      dress clothes: this pretty costume caused him to look
      rather like a conjurer. There followed very polite
      conversations at dinner, full of bows from Mr Wyse; first
      he talked to his hostess, and when Lucia tried to produce
      general talk and spoke to Georgie, he instantly turned his
      head to the right, and talked most politely to his wife
      about the weather and the news in the evening paper till
      Lucia was ready for him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hear from our friend Miss Mapp,' he said to her, 'that
      you speak the most beautiful and fluent Italian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was quite ready to oblige.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, <i>che bella lingua!'</i> said she. <i>'Ma ho
      dimenticato tutto, non parla nessuno</i> in Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I hope you will have the opportunity of speaking it
      before long in Tilling,' said Mr Wyse. 'My sister Amelia,
      Contessa Faraglione, may possibly be with us before long
      and I shall look forward to hearing you and she talk
      together. A lovely language to listen to, though Amelia
      laughs at my poor efforts when I attempt it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia smelled danger here. There had been a terrible
      occasion once at Riseholme when her bilingual reputation
      had been shattered by her being exposed to the full tempest
      of Italian volleyed at her by a native, and she had been
      unable to understand anything that he said. But Amelia's
      arrival was doubtful and at present remote, and it would be
      humiliating to confess that her knowledge was confined to a
      chosen though singularly limited vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, we must rub up our Italian again,' she said. 'Mr
      Wyse's sister may be coming here before long. What an
      opportunity for us to practise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not imagine that you have much need of practice,'
      said Mr Wyse, bowing to Lucia. 'And I hear your Elizabethan
      fête' (he bowed to Queen Elizabeth) 'was an immense
      success. We so much want somebody at Tilling who can
      organize and carry through schemes like that. My wife does
      all she can, but she sadly needs someone to help, or indeed
      direct her. The hospital for instance, terribly in need of
      funds. She and I were talking as to whether we could not
      get up a garden fête with some tableaux or something of the
      sort to raise money. She has designs on you, I know, when
      she can get you alone, for indeed there is no one in
      Tilling with ability and initiative.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it struck Lucia that though this was very
      gratifying to herself, it had another purpose, namely to
      depreciate somebody else, and surely that could only be one
      person. But that name must not escape her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My services, such as they are, are completely at Mrs
      Wyse's disposal,' she said, 'as long as I am in Tilling.
      This garden for instance. Would that be a suitable place
      for something of the sort?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse bowed to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The ideal spot,' said he. 'All Tilling would flock here at
      your bidding. Never yet in my memory has the use of it been
      granted for such a purpose; we have often lamented it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There could no longer be much doubt as to the sub-current
      in such remarks, but the beautiful smooth surface must not
      be broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I quite feel with you,' said Lucia. 'If one is fortunate
      enough, even for a short time, to possess a pretty little
      garden like this, it should be used for the benefit of
      charitable entertainment. The hospital: what more deserving
      object could we have? Some tableaux, you suggested. I'm
      sure Mr Pillson and I would be only too glad to repeat a
      scene or two from our fête at Riseholme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse bowed so low that his large loose tie nearly dipped
      itself in an ice pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was trying to summon my courage to suggest exactly
      that,' he said. 'Susan, Mrs Lucas encourages us to hope
      that she will give you a favourable audience about the
      project we talked over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourable audience began as soon as the ladies rose,
      and was continued when Georgie and Mr Wyse followed them.
      Already it had been agreed that the Padre might contribute
      an item to the entertainment, and that was very convenient,
      for he was to dine with Lucia the next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His Scotch stories,' said Susan. 'I can never hear them
      too often, for though I've not got a drop of Scotch blood
      myself, I can appreciate them. Not a feature of course, Mrs
      Lucas, but just to fill up pauses. And then there's Mrs
      Plaistow. How I laugh when she does the sea-sick passenger
      with an orange, though I doubt if you can get oranges now.
      And Miss Coles. A wonderful mimic. And then there's Major
      Benjy. Perhaps he would read us portions of his diary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed. Lucia had one of those infallible
      presentiments that a certain name hitherto omitted would
      follow. It did.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if Miss Mapp would supply the refreshment department
      with fruit from her garden here, that would be a great
      help,' said Mrs Wyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia caught in rapid succession the respective eyes of all
      her guests, each of whom in turn looked away. 'So Tilling
      knows all about the garden-produce already,' she thought to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge followed, and here she could not be as humble as she
      had been last night, for both the Wyses abased themselves
      before she had time to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We know already,' said Algernon, 'of the class of player
      that you are, Mrs Lucas,' he said. 'Any hints you will give
      Susan and me will be so much appreciated. We shall give you
      no game at all I am afraid, but we shall have a lesson.
      There is no one in Tilling who has any pretensions of being
      a player. Major Benjy and Mrs Plaistow and we sometimes
      have a well-fought rubber on our own level, and the Padre
      does not always play a bad game. But otherwise the less
      said about our bridge the better. Susan, my dear, we must
      do our best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was a reward for Lucia's humility last night.
      The winners had evidently proclaimed her consummate skill,
      and was that, too, a reflection on somebody else, only once
      hitherto named, and that in connection with garden-produce?
      To-night Lucia's hands dripped with aces and kings: she
      denuded her adversaries of all their trumps, and then led
      one more for safety's sake, after which she poured forth a
      galaxy of winners. Whoever was her partner was in luck, and
      to-night it was Georgie who had to beg for change for a
      ten-shilling note and leave the others to adjust their
      portions. He recked nothing of this financial disaster, for
      Foljambe was not lost to him. When the party broke up Mrs
      Wyse begged him to allow her to give him a lift in the
      Royce, but as this would entail a turning of that majestic
      car, which would take at least five minutes followed by a
      long drive for them round the church square and down into
      the High Street and up again to Porpoise Street, he
      adventured forth on foot for his walk of thirty yards and
      arrived without undue fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie and Lucia started their sketching next morning.
      Like charity, they began at home, and their first subjects
      were each other's houses. They put their camp-stools side
      by side, but facing in opposite directions, in the middle
      of the street half-way between Mallards and Mallards
      Cottage; and thus, by their having different objects to
      portray, they avoided any sort of rivalry, and secured each
      other's companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So good for our drawing,' said Georgie. 'We were getting
      to do nothing but trees and clouds which needn't be
      straight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got the crooked chimney,' said Lucia proudly. 'That
      one beyond your house. I think I shall put it straight.
      People might think I had done it crooked by accident. What
      do you advise?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I wouldn't,' said he. 'There's character in its
      crookedness. Or you might make it rather more crooked than
      it is: then there won't be any doubt . . . Here comes the
      Wyses' car. We shall have to move on to the pavement.
      Tarsome.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud hoot warned them that that was the safer course, and
      the car lurched towards them. As it passed, Mr Wyse saw
      whom he had disturbed, stopped the Royce (which had so much
      better a right to the road than the artists) and sprang
      out, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A thousand apologies,' he cried. 'I had no idea who it
      was, and for what artistic purpose, occupying the roadway.
      I am indeed distressed, I would instantly have retreated
      and gone round the other way had I perceived in time. May I
      glance? Exquisite! The crooked chimney! Mallards Cottage!
      The west front of the church!' He bowed to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed that evening the third dinner-party when the
      Padre and wee wifie made the quartet. The Royce had called
      for him that day to take him to lunch in Porpoise Street
      (Lucia had seen it go by), and it was he who now introduced
      the subject of the proposed entertainment on behalf of the
      hospital, for he knew all about it and was ready to help in
      any way that Mistress Lucas might command. There were some
      Scottish stories which he would be happy to narrate, in
      order to fill up intervals between the tableaux, and he had
      ascertained that Miss Coles (dressed as usual as a boy)
      would give her most amusing parody of 'The boy stood on the
      burning deck', and that Mistress Diva said she thought that
      an orange or two might be procured. If not, a ripe tomato
      would serve the purpose. He would personally pledge himself
      for the services of the church choir to sing catches and
      glees and madrigals, whenever required. He suggested also
      that such members of the workhouse as were not bedridden
      might be entertained to tea, in which case the choir would
      sing grace before and after buns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As to the expense of that, if you approve,' he said, 'put
      another baubee on the price of admission, and there'll be
      none in Tilling to grudge the extra expense wi' such
      entertainment as you and the other leddies will offer
      them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me, how quickly it is all taking shape,' said Lucia,
      finding that almost without effort on her part she had been
      drawn into the place of prime mover in all this, and that
      still a sort of conspiracy of silence prevailed with regard
      to Miss Mapp's name, which hitherto had only been mentioned
      as a suitable provider of fruit for the refreshment
      department. 'You must form a little committee, Padre, for
      putting all the arrangements in hand at once. There's Mr
      Wyse who really thought of the idea, and you--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And with yourself,' broke in the Padre, 'that will make
      three. That's sufficient for any committee that is going to
      do its work without any argle-bargle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There flashed across Lucia's mind a fleeting vision of what
      Elizabeth's face would be like when she picked up, as she
      would no doubt do next morning, the news of all that was
      becoming so solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I had better not be on the committee,' she said,
      quite convinced that they would insist on it. 'It should
      consist of real Tillingites who take the lead among you in
      such things. I am only a visitor here. They will all say I
      want to push myself in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, but we can't get on wi' out ye, Mistress Lucas,' said
      the Padre. 'You must consent to join us. An' three, as I
      say, makes the perfect committee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Bartlett had been listening to all this with a look of
      ecstatic attention on her sharp but timid little face. Here
      she gave vent to a series of shrill minute squeaks which
      expressed a mouse-like merriment, quite unexplained by
      anything that had been actually said, but easily accounted
      for by what had not been said. She hastily drank a sip of
      water and assured Lucia that a crumb of something (she was
      eating a peach) had stuck in her throat and made her cough.
      Lucia rose when the peach was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To-morrow we must start working in earnest,' she said.
      'And to think that I planned to have a little holiday in
      Tilling! You and Mr Wyse are regular slave-drivers, Padre.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie waited behind that night after the others had gone,
      and bustled back to the garden-room after seeing them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, it's getting too exciting,' he said. 'But I
      wonder if you're wise to join the committee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know what you mean,' said Lucia, 'but there really is no
      reason why I should refuse, because they won't have
      Elizabeth. It's not me, Georgie, who is keeping her out.
      But perhaps you're right, and I think tomorrow I'll send a
      line to the Padre and say that I am really too busy to be
      on the committee, and beg him to ask Elizabeth instead. It
      would be kinder. I can manage the whole thing just as well
      without being on the committee. She'll hear all about the
      entertainment to-morrow morning, and know that she's not
      going to be asked to do anything, except supply some
      fruit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She knows a good deal about it now,' said Georgie. 'She
      came to tea with me to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! I didn't know you had asked her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't,' said Georgie. 'She came.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what did she say about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not very much, but she's thinking hard what to do. I could
      see that. I gave her the little sketch I made of the
      Landgate when we first came down here, and she wants me to
      send in another picture for the Tilling Art Exhibition. She
      wants you to send something too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly she shall have my sketch of Mallards Cottage and
      the crooked chimney,' said Lucia. 'That will show good
      will. What else did she say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's getting up a jumble-sale in aid of the hospital,'
      said Georgie. 'She's busy, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, that's copied from us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it is; she wants to have a show of her own, and
      I'm sure I don't wonder. And she knows all about your three
      dinner-parties.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia nodded. 'That's all right then,' she said. 'I'll ask
      her to the next. We'll have some duets that night, Georgie.
      Not bridge I think, for they all say she's a perfect terror
      at cards. But it's time to be kind to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, it's becoming a frightful rush already,' she
      said. 'This entertainment which they insist on my managing
      will make me very busy, but when one is appealed to like
      that, one can't refuse. Then there's my music, and
      sketching, and I haven't begun to rub up my Greek . . . And
      don't forget to send for your Drake clothes. Good night, my
      dear. I'll call to you over the garden-paling to-morrow if
      anything happens.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I feel as if it's sure to,' said Georgie with enthusiasm.

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was writing letters in the window of the garden-room
      next morning. One, already finished, was to Adele Brixton
      asking her to send to Mallards the Queen Elizabeth costume
      for the tableaux: a second, also finished, was to the
      Padre, saying that she found she would not have time to
      attend committees for the hospital fête, and begging him to
      co-opt Miss Mapp. She would, however, do all in her power
      to help the scheme, and make any little suggestions that
      occurred to her. She added that the chance of getting fruit
      gratis for the refreshment department would be far brighter
      if the owner of it was on the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third letter, firmly beginning 'Dearest Liblib' (and to
      be signed very large, LUCIA), asking her to dine in two
      days' time, was not quite done when she saw dearest Liblib,
      with a fixed and awful smile, coming swiftly up the street.
      Lucia, sitting sideways to the window, could easily appear
      absorbed in her letter and unconscious of Elizabeth's
      approach, but from beneath half-lowered eyelids she watched
      her with the intensest interest. She was slanting across
      the street now, making a bee-line for the door of Mallards
      ('and if she tries to get in without ringing the bell,
      she'll find the chain on the door,' thought Lucia).
    </p>
    <p>
      The abandoned woman, disdaining the bell, turned the handle
      and pushed. It did not yield to her intrusion, and she
      pushed more strongly. There was the sound of jingling
      metal, audible even in the garden-room, as the hasp that
      held the end of the chain gave way; the door flew open
      wide, and with a few swift and nimble steps she just saved
      herself from falling flat on the floor of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, pale with fury, laid down her pen and waited for the
      situation to develop. She hoped she would behave like a
      lady, but was quite sure it would be a firm sort of lady.
      Presently up the steps to the garden-room came that fairy
      tread, the door was opened an inch, and that odious voice
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I come in, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said Lucia brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lulu dear,' said Elizabeth, tripping across the room with
      little brisk steps. 'First I must apologize: so humbly.
      Such a stupid accident. I tried to open your front door,
      and gave it a teeny little push and your servants had
      forgotten to take the chain down. I am afraid I broke
      something. The hasp must have been rusty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But didn't Grosvenor come to open the door when you rang?'
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was just what I forgot to do, dear,' said Elizabeth.
      'I thought I would pop in to see you without troubling
      Grosvenor. You and I such friends, and so difficult to
      remember that my dear little Mallards--Several things to
      talk about!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us first see what damage you have done,' she said with
      an icy calmness, and marched straight out of the room,
      followed by Elizabeth. The sound of the explosion had
      brought Grosvenor out of the dining-room, and Lucia picked
      up the dangling hasp and examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no sign of rust,' she said. 'Grosvenor, you must go
      down to the ironmonger and get them to come up and repair
      this at once. The chain must be made safer and you must
      remember always to put it on, day and night. If I am out, I
      will ring.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So awfully sorry, dear Lulu,' said Elizabeth, slightly
      cowed by this firm treatment. 'I had no idea the chain
      could be up. We all keep our doors on the latch in Tilling.
      Quite a habit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always used to in Riseholme,' said Lucia. 'Let us go
      back to the garden-room, and you will tell me what you came
      to talk about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Several things,' said Elizabeth when they had settled
      themselves. 'First, I am starting a little jumble-sale for
      the hospital, and I wanted to look out some old curtains
      and rugs, laid away in cupboards, to give to it. May I just
      go upstairs and downstairs and poke about to find them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'By all means,' said Lucia. 'Grosvenor shall go round with
      you as soon as she has come back from the ironmonger's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, dear,' said Elizabeth, 'though there's no need
      to trouble Grosvenor. Then another thing. I persuaded Mr
      Georgie to send me a sketch for our picky exhibition.
      Promise me that you'll send me one too. Wouldn't be
      complete without something by you. How you get all you do
      into the day is beyond me; your sweet music, your
      sketching, and your dinner-parties every evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia readily promised, and Elizabeth then appeared to lose
      herself in reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There <i>is</i> one more thing,' she said at last. 'I have
      heard a little gossip in the town both to-day and yesterday
      about a fête which it is proposed to give in my garden. I
      feel sure it is mere tittle-tattle, but I thought it would
      be better to come up here to know from you that there is no
      foundation for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I hope there is a great deal,' said Lucia. 'Some
      tableaux, some singing, in order to raise funds for the
      hospital. It would be so kind of you if you would supply
      the fruit for the refreshment booth from your garden.
      Apropos I should be so pleased to buy some of it every day
      myself. It would be fresher than if, as at present, it is
      taken down to the greengrocer and brought up again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anything to oblige you, dear Lulu,' said Elizabeth. 'But
      that would be difficult to arrange. I have contracted to
      send all my garden-produce to Twistevant's--such a quaint
      name, is it not?--for these months, and for the same reason
      I should be unable to supply this fête which I have heard
      spoken of. The fruit is no longer mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had already made up her mind that, after this affair
      of the chain, nothing would induce her to propose that
      Elizabeth should take her place on the committee. She would
      cling to it through storm and tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see,' she said. 'Perhaps then you could let us have some
      fruit from Diva's garden, unless you have sold that also.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth came to the point, disregarding so futile a
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The fête itself, dear one,' she said, 'is what I must
      speak about. I cannot possibly permit it to take place in
      my garden. The rag-tag and bob-tail of Tilling passing
      through my hall and my sweet little sitting-room and
      spending the afternoon in my garden! All my carpets soiled
      and my flower-beds trampled on! And how do I know that they
      will not steal upstairs and filch what they can find?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's blood had begun to boil: nobody could say that she
      was preserving a benevolent neutrality. In consequence she
      presented an icy demeanour, and if her voice trembled at
      all, it was from excessive cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There will be no admission to the rooms in the house,' she
      said. 'I will lock all the doors, and I am sure that nobody
      in Tilling will be so ill bred as to attempt to force them
      open.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a nasty one. Elizabeth recoiled for a moment from
      the shock, but rallied. She opened her mouth very wide to
      begin again, but Lucia got in first.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They will pass straight from the front door into the
      garden,' she said, 'where we undertake to entertain them,
      presenting their tickets of admission or paying at the
      door. As for the carpet in your sweet little sitting-room,
      there isn't one. And I have too high an opinion of the
      manners of Tilling in general to suppose that they will
      trample on your flowerbeds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you would like to hire a menagerie,' said
      Elizabeth, completely losing her self-control, 'and have an
      exhibition of tigers and sharks in the garden-room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No: I should particularly dislike it,' said Lucia
      earnestly. 'Half of the garden-room would have to be turned
      into a sea-water tank for the sharks and my piano would be
      flooded. And the rest would have to be full of horse-flesh
      for the tigers. A most ridiculous proposal, and I cannot
      entertain it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth gave a dreadful gasp as if she was one of the
      sharks and the water had been forgotten. She adroitly
      changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then again, there's the rumour--of course it's only
      rumour--that there is some idea of entertaining such
      inmates of the workhouse as are not bedridden. Impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fancy the Padre is arranging that,' said Lucia. 'For my
      part, I'm delighted to give them a little treat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And for my part,' said Miss Mapp, rising (she had become
      Miss Mapp again in Lucia's mind), 'I will not have my
      little home-sanctuary invaded by the rag-tag--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The tickets will be half a crown,' interposed Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--and bob-tail of Tilling,' continued Miss Mapp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As long as I am tenant here,' said Lucia, 'I shall ask
      here whom I please, and when I please, and--and how I
      please. Or do you wish me to send you a list of the friends
      I ask to dinner for your sanction?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp, trembling very much, forced her lips to form the
      syllables:
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, dear Lulu--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Elizabeth, I must beg you not to call me Lulu,' she
      said. 'Such a detestable abbreviation--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor had appeared at the door of the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Grosvenor, what is it?' asked Lucia in precisely the
      same voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The ironmonger is here, ma'am,' she said, 'and he says
      that he'll have to put in some rather large screws, as
      they're pulled out--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever is necessary to make the door safe,' said Lucia.
      'And Miss Mapp wants to look into cupboards and take some
      things of her own away. Go with her, please, and give her
      every facility.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, quite in the grand style, turned to look out of the
      window in the direction of Mallards Cottage, in order to
      give Miss Mapp the opportunity of a discreet exit. She
      threw the window open.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgino! Georgino!' she called, and Georgie's face
      appeared above the paling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come round and have ickle talk, Georgie,' she said.
      'Sumfin' I want to tell you. Presto!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed her hand to Georgie and turned back into the
      room. Miss Mapp was still there, but now invisible to
      Lucia's eye. She hummed a gay bar of Mozartino, and went
      back to her table in the bow-window where she tore up the
      letter of resignation and recommendation she had written to
      the Padre, and the half-finished note to Miss Mapp, which
      so cordially asked her to dinner, saying that it was so
      long since they had met, for they had met again now. When
      she looked up she was alone, and there was Georgie tripping
      up the steps by the front door. Though it was standing open
      (for the ironmonger was already engaged on the firm
      restoration of the chain) he very properly rang the bell
      and was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There you are,' said Lucia brightly as he came in.
      'Another lovely day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfect. What has happened to your front door?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elizabeth came to see me,' she said gaily. 'The chain was
      on the door, as I have ordered it always shall be. But she
      gave the door such a biff that the hasp pulled out. It's
      being repaired.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Georgie, 'and did you give her what for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She had several things she wanted to see me about,' said
      Lucia, keeping an intermittent eye on the front door. 'She
      wanted to get out of her cupboards some stuff for the
      jumble-sale she is getting up in aid of the hospital, and
      she is at it now under Grosvenor's superintendence. Then
      she wanted me to send a sketch for the picture exhibition,
      I said I would be delighted. Then she said she could not
      manage to send any fruit for our fête here. She did not
      approve of the fête at all, Georgie. In fact, she forbade
      me to give it. We had a little chat about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what's to be done then?' asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing that I know of, except to give the fête,' said
      Lucia. 'But it would be no use asking her to be on the
      committee for an object of which she disapproved, so I tore
      up the letter I had written to the Padre about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly focused her eyes and her attention on the
      front door, and a tone of warm human interest melted the
      deadly chill of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, there she goes,' she said. 'What a quantity of
      things! There's an old kettle and a boot-jack, and a rug
      with a hole in it, and one stair-rod. And there's a shaving
      from the front door where they are putting in bigger
      screws, stuck to her skirt . . . And she's dropped the
      stair-rod . . . Major Benjy's picking it up for her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hurried to the window to see these exciting
      happenings, but Miss Mapp, having recovered the stair-rod,
      was already disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I hadn't given her my picture of the Landgate,'
      said he. 'It was one of my best. But aren't you going to
      tell me all about your interview? Properly, I mean:
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not worth speaking of,' said Lucia. 'She asked me if I
      would like to have a menagerie and keep tigers and sharks
      in the garden-room. That sort of thing. Mere raving. Come
      out, Georgie. I want to do a little shopping. Coplen told
      me there were some excellent greengages from the garden
      which he was taking down to Twistevant's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour when the collective social life of Tilling
      was at its briskest. The events of the evening before,
      tea-parties and games of bridge had become known and were
      under discussion, as the ladies of the place with their
      baskets on their arms collided with each other as they
      popped in and out of shops and obstructed the pavements.
      Many parcels were being left at Wasters which Miss Mapp now
      occupied, for jumble-sales on behalf of deserving objects
      were justly popular, since everybody had a lot of junk in
      their houses, which they could not bear to throw away, but
      for which they had no earthly use. Diva had already been
      back from Taormina to her own house (as Elizabeth to hers)
      and had disinterred from a cupboard of rubbish a pair of
      tongs, the claws of which twisted round if you tried to
      pick up a lump of coal and dropped it on the carpet, but
      which were otherwise perfect. Then there was a scuttle
      which had a hole in the bottom, through which coal dust
      softly dribbled, and a candlestick which had lost one of
      its feet, and a glass inkstand once handsome, but now
      cracked. These treasures, handsome donations to a
      jumble-sale, but otherwise of no particular value, she
      carried to her own hall, where donors were requested to
      leave their offerings, and she learned from Withers, Miss
      Mapp's parlourmaid, the disagreeable news that the
      jumble-sale was to be held here. The thought revolted her;
      all the rag-tag and bob-tail of Tilling would come
      wandering about her house, soiling her carpets and smudging
      her walls. At this moment Miss Mapp herself came in
      carrying the tea kettle and the boot-jack and the other
      things. She had already thought of half a dozen withering
      retorts she might have made to Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elizabeth, this will never do,' said Diva. 'I can't have
      the jumble-sale held here. They'll make a dreadful mess of
      the place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, dear,' said Miss Mapp, with searing memories of a
      recent interview in her mind. 'The people will only come
      into your hall where you see there's no carpet, and make
      their purchases. What a beautiful pair of tongs! For my
      sale? Fancy! Thank you, dear Diva.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I forbid the jumble-sale to be held here,' said Diva.
      'You'll be wanting to have a menagerie here next.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was amazing luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, dear, I couldn't dream of it,' said Miss Mapp. 'I
      should hate to have tigers and sharks all over the place.
      Ridiculous!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall put up a merry-go-round in quaint Irene's studio
      at Taormina,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I doubt if there's room, dear,' said Miss Mapp, scoring
      heavily again, 'but you might measure. Perfectly
      legitimate, of course, for if my house may be given over to
      parties for paupers, you can surely have a merry-go-round
      in quaint Irene's and I a jumble-sale in yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's not the same thing,' said Diva. 'Providing beautiful
      tableaux in your garden is quite different from using my
      panelled hall to sell kettles and coal-scuttles with holes
      in them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dare say I could find a good many holes in the
      tableaux,' said Miss Mapp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva could think of no adequate verbal retort to such
      coruscations, so for answer she merely picked up the tongs,
      the coal-scuttle, the candlestick and the inkstand, and put
      them back in the cupboard from which she had just taken
      them, and left her tenant to sparkle by herself.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the damaged objects for the jumble-sale must have
      arrived by now, and after arranging them in tasteful groups
      Miss Mapp sat down in a rickety basket-chair presented by
      the Padre for fell meditation. Certainly it was not pretty
      of Diva (no one could say that Diva was pretty) to have
      withdrawn her treasures, but that was not worth thinking
      about. What did demand her highest mental activities was
      Lucia's conduct. How grievously different she had turned
      out to be from that sweet woman for whom she had originally
      felt so warm an affection, whom she had planned to take so
      cosily under her wing, and administer in small doses as
      treats to Tilling society! Lucia had turned upon her and
      positively bitten the caressing hand. By means of showy
      little dinners and odious flatteries, she had quite
      certainly made Major Benjy and the Padre and the Wyses and
      poor Diva think that she was a very remarkable and
      delightful person and in these manoeuvres Miss Mapp saw a
      shocking and sinister attempt to set herself up as the
      Queen of Tilling society. Lucia had given dinner-parties on
      three consecutive nights since her return, she had put
      herself on the committee for this fête, which (however much
      Miss Mapp might say she could not possibly permit it) she
      had not the slightest idea how to stop, and though Lucia
      was only a temporary resident here, these weeks would be
      quite intolerable if she continued to inflate herself in
      this presumptuous manner. It was certainly time for Miss
      Mapp to reassert herself before this rebel made more
      progress, and though dinner-giving was unusual in Tilling,
      she determined to give one or two most amusing ones
      herself, to none of which, of course, she would invite
      Lucia. But that was not nearly enough: she must administer
      some frightful snub (or snubs) to the woman. Georgie was in
      the same boat and must suffer too, for Lucia would not like
      that. So she sat in this web of crippled fire-irons and
      napless rugs like a spider, meditating reprisals. Perhaps
      it was a pity, when she needed allies, to have quarrelled
      with Diva, but a dinner would set that right. Before long
      she got up with a pleased expression. 'That will do to
      begin with: she won't like that at all,' she said to
      herself and went out to do her belated marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed Lucia and Georgie, but decided not to see them,
      and, energetically waving her hand to Mrs Bartlett, she
      popped into Twistevant's, from the door of which they had
      just come out. At that moment quaint Irene, after a few
      words with the Padre, caught sight of Lucia, and hurried
      across the street to her. She was hatless, as usual, and
      wore a collarless shirt and knickerbockers unlike any other
      lady of Tilling, but as she approached Lucia her face
      assumed an acid and awful smile, just like somebody else's,
      and then she spoke in a cooing velvety voice that was quite
      unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The boy stood on the burning deck, Lulu,' she said.
      'Whence all but he had fled, dear. The flames that lit the
      battle-wreck, sweet one, shone round him--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Quaint Irene broke off suddenly, for within a yard of her
      at the door of Twistevant's appeared Miss Mapp. She looked
      clean over all their heads, and darted across the street to
      Wasters, carrying a small straw basket of her own delicious
      greengages.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, lor!' said Irene. 'The Mapp's in the fire, so that's
      done. Yes. I'll recite for you at your fête. Georgie, what
      a saucy hat! I was just going to Taormina to rout out some
      old sketches of mine for the Art Show, and then this
      happens. I wouldn't have had it not happen for a hundred
      pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come and dine to-night,' said Lucia warmly, breaking all
      records in the way of hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, if I needn't dress, and you'll send me home
      afterwards. I'm half a mile out of the town and I may be
      tipsy, for Major Benjy says you've got jolly good booze,
      <i>"quai-hai",</i> the King, God bless him! Good-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'Most original!' said Lucia. 'To go on with what I was
      telling you, Georgie, Liblib said she would not have her
      little home-sanctuary--Good morning, Padre. Miss Mapp
      shoved her way into Mallards this morning without ringing,
      and broke the chain which was on the door, such a hurry was
      she in to tell me that she will not have her little
      home-sanctuary, as I was just saying to Georgie, invaded by
      the rag-tag and bobtail of Tilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoots awa!' said the Padre. 'What in the world has
      Mistress Mapp got to do with it? An' who's holding a
      jumble-sale in Mistress Plaistow's? I keeked in just now
      wi' my bit o' rubbish and never did I see such a mess. Na,
      na! Fair play's a jool, an' we'll go richt ahead. Excuse
      me, there's wee wifie wanting me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's war,' said Georgie as the Padre darted across to the
      Mouse, who was on the other side of the street, to tell her
      what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'm just defending myself,' said Lucia. 'It's right
      that people should know she burst my door-chain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I feel like the fourth of August, 1914,' said
      Georgie. 'What do you suppose she'll do next?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may depend upon it, Georgie, that I shall be ready for
      her whatever it is,' said Lucia. 'I shan't raise a finger
      against her, if she behaves. But she <i>shall</i> ring the
      bell and I <i>won't</i> be dictated to and I <i>won't</i>
      be called Lulu. However, there's no immediate danger of
      that. Come, Georgie, let us go home and finish our
      sketches. Then we'll have them framed and send them to
      Liblib for the picture exhibition. Perhaps that will
      convince her of my general good will, which I assure you is
      quite sincere.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The jumble-sale opened next day, and Georgie, having taken
      his picture of Lucia's house and her picture of his to be
      framed in a very handsome manner, went on to Wasters with
      the idea of buying anything that could be of the smallest
      use for any purpose, and thus showing more good will
      towards the patroness. Miss Mapp was darting to and fro
      with lures for purchasers, holding the kettle away from the
      light so that the hole in its bottom should not be noticed,
      and she gave him a smile that looked rather like a snarl,
      but after all very like the smile she had for others.
      Georgie selected a hearth-brush, some curtain-rings and a
      kettle-holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in a dark corner he came across a large cardboard
      tray, holding miscellaneous objects with the label 'All
      6<i>d</i> Each'. There were thimbles, there were
      photographs with slightly damaged frames, there were
      chipped china ornaments and cork-screws, and there was the
      picture of the Landgate which he had painted himself and
      given Miss Mapp. Withers, Miss Mapp's parlourmaid, was at a
      desk for the exchange of custom by the door, and he
      exhibited his purchases for her inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ninepence for the hearth-brush and threepence for the
      curtain-rings,' said Georgie in a trembling voice, 'and
      sixpence for the kettle-holder. Then there's this little
      picture out of the sixpenny tray, which makes just two
      shillings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Laden with these miscellaneous purchases he went swiftly up
      the street to Mallards. Lucia was at the window of the
      garden-room, and her gimlet eye saw that something had
      happened. She threw the sash up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm afraid the chain is on the door, Georgie,' she called
      out. 'You'll have to ring. What is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll show you,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deposited the hearth-brush, the curtain-rings and the
      kettle-holder in the hall, and hurried out to the
      garden-room with the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The sketch I gave her,' he said. 'In the sixpenny tray.
      Why, the frame cost a shilling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's face became a flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never heard of such a thing, Georgie,' said she. 'The
      monstrous woman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It may have got there by mistake,' said Georgie,
      frightened at this Medusa countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rubbish, Georgie,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Pictures for the annual exhibition of the Art Society of
      which Miss Mapp was President had been arriving in
      considerable numbers at Wasters, and stood stacked round
      the walls of the hall where the jumble-sale had been held a
      few days before, awaiting the judgment of the hanging
      committee which consisted of the President, the Treasurer
      and the Secretary: the two latter were Mr and Mrs Wyse.
      Miss Mapp had sent in half a dozen water-colours, the
      Treasurer a study in still-life of a teacup, an orange and
      a wallflower, the Secretary a pastel portrait of the King
      of Italy, whom she had seen at a distance in Rome last
      spring. She had reinforced the vivid impression he had made
      on her by photographs. All these, following the precedent
      of the pictures of Royal Academicians at Burlington House,
      would be hung on the line without dispute, and there could
      not be any friction concerning them. But quaint Irene had
      sent some at which Miss Mapp felt lines must be drawn. They
      were, as usual, very strange and modern: there was one,
      harmless but insane, that purported to be Tilling church by
      moonlight: a bright green pinnacle all crooked (she
      supposed it was a pinnacle) rose up against a strip of
      purple sky and the whole of the rest of the canvas was
      black. There was the back of somebody with no clothes on
      lying on an emerald-green sofa: and, worst of all, there
      was a picture called 'Women Wrestlers', from which Miss
      Mapp hurriedly averted her eyes. A proper regard for
      decency alone, even if Irene had not mimicked her reciting
      'The boy stood on the burning deck', would have made her
      resolve to oppose, tooth and nail, the exhibition of these
      shameless athletes. Unfortunately Mr Wyse had the most
      unbounded admiration for quaint Irene's work, and if she
      had sent in a picture of mixed wrestlers he would probably
      have said, 'Dear me, very powerful!' He was a hard man to
      resist, for if he and Miss Mapp had a very strong
      difference of opinion concerning any particular canvas he
      broke off and fell into fresh transports of admiration at
      her own pictures and this rather disarmed opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting of the hanging committee was to take place this
      morning at noon. Half an hour before that time, an
      errand-boy arrived at Wasters from the frame-maker's
      bringing, according to the order he had received, two
      parcels which contained Georgie's picture of Mallards and
      Lucia's picture of Mallards Cottage: they had the cards of
      their perpetrators attached. 'Rubbishy little daubs,'
      thought Miss Mapp to herself, 'but I suppose those two
      Wyses will insist.' Then an imprudent demon of revenge
      suddenly took complete possession of her, and she called
      back the boy, and said she had a further errand for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter before twelve the boy arrived at Mallards and
      rang the bell. Grosvenor took down the chain and received
      from him a thin square parcel labelled 'With care'. One
      minute afterwards he delivered a similar parcel to Foljambe
      at Mallards Cottage, and had discharged Miss Mapp's further
      errand. The two maids conveyed these to their employers,
      and Georgie and Lucia, tearing off the wrappers, found
      themselves simultaneously confronted with their own
      pictures. A typewritten slip accompanied each, conveying to
      them the cordial thanks of the hanging committee and its
      regrets that the limited wall-space at its disposal would
      not permit of these works of art being exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie ran out into his little yard and looked over the
      paling of Lucia's garden. At the same moment Lucia threw
      open the window of the garden-room which faced towards the
      paling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, have you received--' she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So have I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you going to do?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's face assumed an expression eager and pensive, the
      far-away look with which she listened to Beethoven. She
      thought intently for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall take a season ticket for the exhibition,' she
      said, 'and constantly--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't quite hear you,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia raised her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall buy a season ticket for the exhibition,' she
      shouted, 'and go there every day. Believe me, that's the
      only way to take it. They don't want our pictures, but we
      mustn't be small about it. Dignity, Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to add to so sublime a declaration and
      Lucia went across to the bow-window, looking down the
      street. At that moment the Wyses' Royce lurched out of
      Porpoise Street, and turned down towards the High Street.
      Lucia knew they were both on the hanging committee which
      had just rejected one of her own most successful sketches
      (for the crooked chimney had turned out beautifully), but
      she felt not the smallest resentment towards them. No doubt
      they had acted quite conscientiously and she waved her hand
      in answer to a flutter of sables from the interior of the
      car. Presently she went down herself to the High Street to
      hear the news of the morning, and there was the Wyses' car
      drawn up in front of Wasters. She remembered then that the
      hanging committee met this morning, and a suspicion, too
      awful to be credible, flashed through her mind. But she
      thrust it out, as being unworthy of entertainment by a
      clean mind. She did her shopping and on her return took
      down a pale straw-coloured sketch by Miss Mapp that hung in
      the garden-room, and put in its place her picture of
      Mallards Cottage and the crooked chimney. Then she called
      to mind that powerful platitude, and said to herself that
      time would show . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp had not intended to be present at the desecration
      of her garden by paupers from the workhouse and such low
      haunts. She had consulted her solicitor, about her power to
      stop the entertainment, but he assured her that there was
      no known statute in English law, which enabled her to
      prevent her tenant giving a party. So she determined, in
      the manner of Lucia and the Elizabethan fête at Riseholme,
      to be unaware of it, not to know that any fête was
      contemplated, and never afterwards to ask a single question
      about it. But as the day approached she suspected that the
      hot tide of curiosity, rapidly rising in her, would
      probably end by swamping and submerging her principles. She
      had seen the Padre dressed in a long black cloak, and
      carrying an axe of enormous size, entering Mallards; she
      had seen Diva come out in a white satin gown and scuttle
      down the street to Taormina, and those two prodigies taken
      together suggested that the execution of Mary Queen of
      Scots was in hand. (Diva as the Queen!) She had seen boards
      and posts carried in by the garden-door and quantities of
      red cloth, so there was perhaps to be a stage for these
      tableaux. More intriguing yet was the apparition of Major
      Benjy carrying a cardboard crown glittering with gold
      paper. What on earth did that portend? Then there was her
      fruit to give an eye to: those choir-boys, scampering all
      over the garden in the intervals between their glees, would
      probably pick every pear from the tree. She starved to know
      what was going on, but since she avoided all mention of the
      fête herself, others were most amazingly respectful to her
      reticence. She knew nothing, she could only make these
      delirious guesses, and there was <i>that</i> Lucia, being
      the centre of executioners and queens and choir-boys,
      instead of in her proper place, made much of by kind Miss
      Mapp, and enjoying such glimpses of Tilling society as she
      chose to give her. 'A fortnight ago,' thought kind Miss
      Mapp, 'I was popping in and out of the house, and she was
      Lulu. Anyhow, that was a nasty one she got over her
      picture, and I must bear her no grudge. I shall go to the
      fête because I can't help it, and I shall be very cordial
      to her and admire her tableaux. We're all Christians
      together, and I despise smallness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was distressing to be asked to pay half a crown for
      admittance to her own Mallards, but there seemed positively
      no other way to get past Grosvenor. Very distressing, too,
      it was, to see Lucia in full fig as Queen Elizabeth,
      graciously receiving newcomers on the edge of the lawn,
      precisely as if this was her party and these people who had
      paid half a crown to come in, her invited guests. It was a
      bitter thought that it ought to be herself who (though not
      dressed in all that flummery, so unconvincing by daylight)
      welcomed the crowd; for to whom, pray, did Mallards belong,
      and who had allowed it (since she could not stop it) to be
      thrown open? At the bottom of the steps into the
      garden-room was a large placard 'Private', but of course
      that would not apply to her. Through the half-opened door,
      as she passed, she caught a glimpse of a familiar figure,
      though sadly travestied, sitting in a robe and a golden
      crown and pouring something into a glass: no doubt then the
      garden-room was the green-room of performers in the
      tableaux, who, less greedy of publicity than Lulu, hid
      themselves here till the time of their exposure brought
      them out. She would go in there presently, but her
      immediate duty, bitter but necessary, was to greet her
      hostess. With a very happy inspiration she tripped up to
      Lucia and dropped a low curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your Majesty's most obedient humble servant,' she said,
      and then trusting that Lucia had seen that this obeisance
      was made in a mocking spirit, abounded in geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, what a love of a costume!' she said. 'And what a
      lovely day for your fête! And what a crowd! How the
      half-crowns have been pouring in! All Tilling seems to be
      here, and I'm sure I don't wonder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rivalled these cordialities with equal fervour and
      about as much sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elizabeth! How nice of you to look in!' she said.
      <i>'Ecco, le due Elizabethe!</i> And you like my frock?
      Sweet of you! Yes. Tilling has indeed come to the aid of
      the hospital! And your jumble-sale too was a wonderful
      success, was it not? Nothing left, I am told.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp had a moment's hesitation as to whether she
      should not continue to stand by Lucia and shake hands with
      new arrivals and give them a word of welcome, but she
      decided she could do more effective work if she made
      herself independent and played hostess by herself. Also
      this mention of the jumble-sale made her slightly uneasy.
      Withers had told her that Georgie had bought his own
      picture of the Landgate from the sixpenny tray, and Lucia
      (for all her cordiality) might be about to spring some
      horrid trap on her about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, indeed,' she said. 'My little sale-room was soon as
      bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard. But I mustn't monopolize
      you, dear, or I shall be lynched. There's a whole
      <i>queue</i> of people waiting to get a word with you. How
      I shall enjoy the tableaux! Looking forward to them so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sidled off into the crowd. There were those dreadful
      old wretches from the workhouse, snuffy old things, some of
      them smoking pipes on her lawn and scattering matches, and
      being served with tea by Irene and the Padre's curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So pleased to see you all here,' she said, 'sitting in my
      garden and enjoying your tea. I must pick a nice nosegay
      for you to take back home. How de do, Mr Sturgis. Delighted
      you could come and help to entertain the old folks for us.
      Good afternoon, Mr Wyse; yes, my little garden is looking
      nice, isn't it? Susan, dear! Have you noticed my bed of
      delphiniums? I must give you some seed. Oh, there is the
      town-crier ringing his bell! I suppose that means we must
      take our places for the tableaux. What a good stage! I hope
      the posts will not have made very big holes in my lawn. Oh,
      one of those naughty choir-boys is hovering about my
      fig-tree. I cannot allow that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried off to stop any possibility of such
      depredation, and had made some telling allusions to the
      eighth commandment when on a second peal of the
      town-crier's bell, the procession of mummers came down the
      steps of the garden-room and advancing across the lawn
      disappeared behind the stage. Poor Major Benjy (so weak of
      him to allow himself to be dragged into this sort of thing)
      looked a perfect guy in his crown (who could he be meant
      for?) and as for Diva--Then there was Georgie (Drake
      indeed!), and last of all Queen Elizabeth with her train
      held up by two choir-boys. Poor Lucia! Not content with a
      week of mumming at Riseholme she had to go on with her
      processions and dressings-up here. Some people lived on
      limelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp could not bring herself to take a seat close to
      the stage, and be seen applauding--there seemed to be some
      hitch with the curtain: no, it righted itself, what a
      pity!--and she hung about on the outskirts of the audience.
      Glees were interposed between the tableaux; how thin were
      the voices of those little boys out of doors! Then Irene,
      dressed like a sailor, recited that ludicrous parody. Roars
      of laughter. Then Major Benjy was King Cophetua: that was
      why he had a crown. Oh dear, oh dear! It was sad to reflect
      that an elderly, sensible man (for when at his best, he was
      that) could be got hold of by a pushing woman. The final
      tableau, of course (anyone might have guessed that), was
      the knighting of Drake by Queen Elizabeth. Then amid
      sycophantic applause the procession of guys returned and
      went back into the garden-room. Mr and Mrs Wyse followed
      them, and it seemed pretty clear that they were going to
      have a private tea there. Doubtless she would be soon
      sought for among the crowd with a message from Lucia to
      hope that she would join them in her own garden-room, but
      as nothing of the sort came, she presently thought that it
      would be only kind to Lucia to do so, and add her voice to
      the general chorus of congratulation that was no doubt
      going on. So with a brisk little tap on the door, and the
      inquiry 'May I come in?' she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they all were, as pleased as children with
      dressing-up. King Cophetua still wore his crown, tilted
      slightly to one side like a forage cap, and he and Queen
      Elizabeth and Queen Mary were seated round the tea-table
      and calling each other your Majesty. King Cophetua had a
      large whisky and soda in front of him and Miss Mapp felt
      quite certain it was not his first. But though sick in soul
      at these puerilities she pulled herself together and made a
      beautiful curtsey to the silly creatures. And the worst of
      it was that there was no one left of her own intimate
      circle to whom she could in private express her disdain,
      for they were all in it, either actively or, like the
      Wyses, truckling to Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia for the moment seemed rather surprised to see her,
      but she welcomed her and poured her out a cup of rather
      tepid tea, nasty to the taste. She must truckle, too, to
      the whole lot of them, though that tasted nastier than the
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I congratulate you all,' she cried. 'Padre, you looked
      too cruel as executioner, your mouth so fixed and stern. It
      was quite a relief when the curtain came down. Irene,
      quaint one, how you made them laugh! Diva, Mr Georgie, and
      above all our wonderful Queen Lucia. What a treat it has
      all been! The choir! Those beautiful glees. A thousand
      pities, Mr Wyse, that the Contessa was not here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still Susan to whom she ought to say something
      pleasant, but positively she could not go on, until she had
      eaten something solid. But Lucia chimed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And your garden, Elizabeth,' she said. 'How they are
      enjoying it. I believe if the truth was known they are all
      glad that our little tableaux are over, so that they can
      wander about and admire the flowers. I must give a little
      party some night soon with Chinese lanterns and
      fairy-lights in the beds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my word, your Majesty is spoiling us all,' said Major
      Benjy. 'Tilling's never had a month with so much pleasure
      provided for it. Glorious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp had resolved to stop here if it was anyhow
      possible, till these sycophants had dispersed, and then
      have one private word with Lucia to indicate how ready she
      was to overlook all the little frictions that had
      undoubtedly arisen. She fully meant, without eating a
      morsel of humble pie herself, to allow Lucia to eat proud
      pie, for she saw that just for the present she herself was
      nowhere and Lucia everywhere. So Lucia should glut herself
      into a sense of complete superiority, and then it would be
      time to begin fresh manoeuvres. Major Benjy and Diva soon
      took themselves off: she saw them from the garden-window
      going very slowly down the street, ever so pleased to have
      people staring at them, and Irene, at the Padre's request,
      went out to dance a hornpipe on the lawn in her sailor
      clothes. But the two Wyses (always famous for sticking)
      remained and Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse got up from the tea-table and passed round behind
      Miss Mapp's chair. Out of the corner of her eye she could
      see he was looking at the wall where a straw-coloured
      picture of her own hung. He always used to admire it, and
      it was pleasant to feel that he was giving it so careful
      and so respectful a scrutiny. Then he spoke to Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How well I remember seeing you painting that,' he said,
      'and how long I took to forgive myself for having disturbed
      you in my blundering car. A perfect little masterpiece,
      Mallards Cottage and the crooked chimney. To the life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan heaved herself up from the sofa and joined in the
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfectly delightful,' she said. 'The lights, the shadows.
      Beautiful! What a touch!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp turned her head slowly as if she had a stiff
      neck, and verified her awful conjecture that it was no
      longer a picture of her own that hung there, but the very
      picture of Lucia's which had been rejected for the Art
      Exhibition. She felt as if no picture but a bomb hung
      there, which might explode at some chance word, and blow
      her into a thousand fragments. It was best to hurry from
      this perilous neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Lucia,' she said, 'I must be off. Just one little
      stroll, if I may, round my garden, before I go home. My
      roses will never forgive me, if I go away without noticing
      them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I wish I had known it was finished!' said Mr Wyse. 'I
      should have begged you to allow us to have it for our Art
      Exhibition. It would have been the gem of it. Cruel of you,
      Mrs Lucas!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I sent it in to the hanging committee,' said Lucia.
      'Georgie sent his, too, of Mallards. They were both sent
      back to us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse turned from the picture to Lucia with an expression
      of incredulous horror, and Miss Mapp quietly turned to
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But impossible,' he said. 'I am on the hanging committee
      myself, and I hope you cannot think I should have been such
      an imbecile. Susan is on the committee too: so is Miss
      Mapp. In fact, we are the hanging committee. Susan, that
      gem, that little masterpiece never came before us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never,' said Susan. 'Never. Never, never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse's eye transferred itself to Miss Mapp. She was
      still stone and her face was as white as the wall of
      Mallards Cottage in the masterpiece. Then for the first
      time in the collective memory of Tilling Mr Wyse allowed
      himself to use slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There has been some hanky-panky,' he said. 'That picture
      never came before the hanging committee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone image could just move its eyes and they looked,
      in a glassy manner, at Lucia. Lucia's met them with one
      short gimlet thrust, and she whisked round to Georgie. Her
      face was turned away from the others, and she gave him a
      prodigious wink, as he sat there palpitating with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Georgino mio,'</i> she said. 'Let us recall exactly
      what happened. The morning, I mean, when the hanging
      committee met. Let me see: let me see. Don't interrupt me:
      I will get it all clear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pressed her hands to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have it,' she said. 'It is perfectly vivid to me now.
      You had taken our little pictures down to the framer's,
      Georgie, and told him to send them in to Elizabeth's house
      direct. That was it. The errand-boy from the framer's came
      up here that very morning, and delivered mine to Grosvenor,
      and yours to Foljambe. Let me think exactly when that was.
      What time was it, Mr Wyse, that the hanging committee met?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At twelve, precisely,' said Mr Wyse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That fits in perfectly,' said Lucia. 'I called to Georgie
      out of the window here, and we told each other that our
      pictures had been rejected. A moment later, I saw your car
      go down to the High Street and when I went down there soon
      afterwards, it was standing in front of Miss--I mean
      Elizabeth's house. Clearly what happened was that the
      framer misunderstood Georgie's instructions, and returned
      the pictures to us before the hanging committee sat at all.
      So you never saw them, and we imagined all the time--did we
      not, Georgie?--that you had simply sent them back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what must you have thought of us?' said Mr Wyse, with
      a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, that you did not conscientiously think very much of
      our art,' said Lucia. 'We were perfectly satisfied with
      your decision. I felt sure that my little picture had a
      hundred faults and feeblenesses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp had become unpetrified. Could it be that by some
      miraculous oversight she had not put into those parcels the
      formal, typewritten rejection of the committee? It did not
      seem likely, for she had a very vivid remembrance of the
      gratification it gave her to do so, but the only
      alternative theory was to suppose a magnanimity on Lucia's
      part which seemed even more miraculous. She burst into
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How we all congratulate ourselves,' she cried, 'that it
      has all been cleared up! Such a stupid errand-boy! What are
      we to do next, Mr Wyse? Our exhibition must secure Lucia's
      sweet picture, and of course Mr Pillson's too. But how are
      we to find room for them? Everything is hung.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing easier,' said Mr Wyse. 'I shall instantly withdraw
      my paltry little piece of still-life, and I am sure that
      Susan--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, that would never do,' said Miss Mapp, currying favour
      all round. 'That beautiful wallflower, I could almost smell
      it: that King of Italy. Mine shall go: two or three of
      mine. I insist on it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse bowed to Lucia and then to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have a plan better yet,' he said. 'Let us put--if we may
      have the privilege of securing what was so nearly lost to
      our exhibition--let us put these two pictures on easels as
      showing how deeply we appreciate our good fortune in
      getting them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to his wife, he bowed--was it quite a bow?--to
      Miss Mapp, and had there been a mirror, he would no doubt
      have bowed to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Besides,' he said, 'our little sketches will not thus
      suffer so much from their proximity to--' and he bowed to
      Lucia. 'And if Mr Pillson will similarly allow us--' he
      bowed to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, following Lucia's lead, graciously offered to go
      round to the Cottage and bring back his picture of
      Mallards, but Mr Wyse would not hear of such a thing. He
      and Susan would go off in the Royce now, with Lucia's
      masterpiece, and fetch Georgie's from Mallards Cottage, and
      the sun should not set before they both stood on their
      distinguished easels in the enriched exhibition. So off
      they went in a great hurry to procure the easels before the
      sun went down and Miss Mapp, unable alone to face the
      reinstated victims of her fraud, scurried after them in a
      tumult of mixed emotions. Outside in the garden Irene,
      dancing hornpipes, was surrounded by both sexes of the
      enraptured youth of Tilling, for the boys knew she was a
      girl, and the girls thought she looked so like a boy. She
      shouted out 'Come and dance, Mapp,' and Elizabeth fled from
      her own sweet garden as if it had been a plague-stricken
      area, and never spoke to her roses at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen and Drake were left alone in the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I never!' said Georgie. 'Did you? She sent them back
      all by herself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not the least surprised,' said Lucia. 'It's like her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why did you let her off?' he asked. 'You ought to have
      exposed her and have done with her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia showed a momentary exultation, and executed a few
      steps from a Morris-dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Georgie, that would have been a mistake,' she said.
      'She knows that we know, and I can't wish her worse than
      that. And I rather think, though he makes me giddy with so
      much bowing, that Mr Wyse has guessed. He certainly
      suspects something of the sort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he said there had been some hanky-panky,' said
      Georgie. 'That was a strong thing for him to say. All the
      same--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'm right,' she said. 'Don't you see I've taken the
      moral stuffing out of that woman far more completely than
      if I had exposed her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she's a cheat,' cried Georgie. 'She's a liar, for she
      sent back our pictures with a formal notice that the
      committee had rejected them. She hasn't got any moral
      stuffing to take out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pondered this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true, there doesn't seem to be much,' she said.
      'But even then, think of the moral stuffing that I've put
      into myself. A far greater score, Georgie, than to have
      exposed her, and it must be quite agonizing for her to have
      that hanging over her head. Besides, she can't help being
      deeply grateful to me if there are any depths in that poor
      shallow nature. There may be: we must try to discover them.
      Take a broader view of it all, Georgie . . . Oh, and I've
      thought of something fresh! Send round to Mr Wyse for the
      exhibition your picture of the Landgate, which poor
      Elizabeth sold. He will certainly hang it and she will see
      it there. That will round everything off nicely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia moved across to the piano and sat down on the treble
      music-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us forget all about these <i>piccoli disturbi,</i>
      Georgie,' she said, 'and have some music to put us in tune
      with beauty again. No, you needn't shut the door: it is so
      hot, and I am sure that no one else will dream of passing
      that notice of "Private", or come in here unasked. Ickle
      bit of divine Mozartino?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia found the duet at which she had worked quietly at odd
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let us try this,' she said, 'though it looks rather diffy.
      Oh, one thing more, Georgie. I think you and I had better
      keep those formal notices of rejection from the hanging
      committee just in case. We might need them some day, though
      I'm sure I hope we shan't. But one must be careful in
      dealing with that sort of woman. That's all I think. Now
      let us breathe harmony and loveliness again. <i>Uno,
      due</i> . . . pom.'
    </p>

          id="c06">CHAPTER 6</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mellow morning of October, the season, as Lucia
      reflected, of mists and mellow fruitfulness, wonderful John
      Keats. There was no doubt about the mists, for there had
      been several sea-fogs in the English Channel, and the
      mellow fruitfulness of the garden at Mallards was equally
      indisputable. But now the fruitfulness of that sunny plot
      concerned Lucia far more than it had done during August and
      September, for she had taken Mallards for another month
      (Adele Brixton having taken the Hurst, Riseholme, for
      three), not on those original Shylock terms of fifteen
      guineas a week, and no garden-produce--but of twelve
      guineas a week, and all the garden-produce. It was a
      wonderful year for tomatoes: there were far more than a
      single widow could possibly eat, and Lucia, instead of
      selling them, constantly sent little presents of them to
      Georgie and Major Benjy. She had sent one basket of them to
      Miss Mapp, but these had been returned and Miss Mapp had
      written an effusive note saying that they would be wasted
      on her. Lucia had applauded that; it showed a very proper
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain of consequences, therefore, of Lucia's remaining
      at Mallards was far-reaching. Miss Mapp took Wasters for
      another month at a slightly lower rent, Diva extended her
      lease of Taormina, and Irene still occupied the four-roomed
      labourer's cottage outside Tilling, which suited her so
      well, and the labourer and his family remained in the
      hop-picker's shanty. It was getting chilly of nights in the
      shanty, and he looked forward to the time when, Adele
      having left the Hurst, his cottage could be restored to
      him. Nor did the chain of consequences end here, for
      Georgie could not go back to Riseholme without Foljambe,
      and Foljambe would not go back there and leave her Cadman,
      while Lucia remained at Mallards. So Isabel Poppit
      continued to inhabit her bungalow by the sea, and Georgie
      remained in Mallards Cottage. With her skin turned black
      with all those sun-baths, and her hair spiky and wiry with
      so many sea-baths, Isabel resembled a cross between a
      kipper and a sea-urchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      September had been full of events. The Art Exhibition had
      been a great success, and quantities of the pictures had
      been sold. Lucia had bought Georgie's picture, of Mallards,
      Georgie had bought Lucia's picture of Mallards Cottage, Mr
      Wyse had bought his wife's pastel of the King of Italy, and
      sent it as a birthday present to Amelia, and Susan Wyse had
      bought her husband's teacup and wallflower and kept them
      herself. But the greatest gesture of all had been Lucia's
      purchase of one of Miss Mapp's six exhibits, and this had
      practically forced Miss Mapp, so powerful was the
      suggestion hidden in it, to buy Georgie's picture of the
      Landgate, which he had given her, and which she had sold
      (not even for her own benefit but for that of the hospital)
      for sixpence at her jumble-sale. She had had to pay a
      guinea to regain what had once been hers, so that in the
      end the revengeful impulse which had prompted her to put it
      in the sixpenny tray had been cruelly expensive. But she
      had still felt herself to be under Lucia's thumb in the
      whole matter of the exhibition (as indeed she was) and this
      purchase was of the nature of a propitiatory act. They had
      met one morning at the show, and Lucia had looked long at
      this sketch of Georgie's and then, looking long at
      Elizabeth, she had said it was one of the most charming and
      exquisite of his water-colours. Inwardly raging, yet
      somehow impotent to resist, Elizabeth had forked up. But
      she was now busily persuading herself that this purchase
      had something to do with the hospital, and that she need
      not make any further contributions to its funds this year:
      she felt there was a very good chance of persuading herself
      about this. No one had bought quaint Irene's pictures, and
      she had turned the women wrestlers into men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then Miss Mapp had been very busy with the conversion
      of the marvellous crop of apples, plums and red-currants in
      Diva's garden into jam and jelly. Her cook could not tackle
      so big a job alone, and she herself spent hours a day in
      the kitchen, and the most delicious odours of boiling
      preserves were wafted out of the windows into the High
      Street. It could not be supposed that they would escape
      Diva's sharp nose, and there had been words about it. But
      garden-produce (Miss Mapp believed) meant what it said, or
      would dear Diva prefer that she let the crop rot on the
      trees, and be a portion for wasps. Diva acknowledged that
      she would. And when the fruit was finished Miss Mapp
      proposed to turn her attention to the vegetable marrows,
      which, with a little ginger, made a very useful preserve
      for the household. She would leave a dozen of these pots
      for Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the jam-making was over now and Miss Mapp was glad of
      that, for she had scalded her thumb: quite a blister. She
      was even gladder that the Art Exhibition was over. All the
      important works of the Tilling school (except the pastel of
      the King of Italy) remained in Tilling, she had made her
      propitiatory sacrifice about Georgie's sketch of the
      Landgate, and she had no reason to suppose that Lucia had
      ever repented of that moment of superb magnanimity in the
      garden-room, which had averted an exposure of which she
      still occasionally trembled to think. Lucia could not go
      back on that now, it was all over and done with like the
      jam-making (though, like the jam-making, it had left a
      certain seared and sensitive place behind) and having held
      her tongue then, Lucia could not blab afterwards. Like the
      banns in church, she must for ever hold her peace. Miss
      Mapp had been deeply grateful for that clemency at the
      time, but no one could go on being grateful indefinitely.
      You were grateful until you had paid your debt of
      gratitude, and then you were free. She would certainly be
      grateful again, when this month was over and Lucia and
      Georgie left Tilling, never, she hoped, to return, but for
      the last week or two she had felt that she had discharged
      in full every groat of gratitude she owed Lucia, and her
      mind had been busier than usual over plots and plans and
      libels and inductions with regard to her tenant who, with
      those cheese-paring ways so justly abhorred by Miss Mapp,
      had knocked down the rent to twelve guineas a week and
      grabbed the tomatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Mapp did not yet despair of dealing Lucia some
      nasty blow, for the fact of the matter was (she felt sure
      of it) that Tilling generally was growing a little restive
      under Lucia's autocratic ways. She had been taking them in
      hand, she had been patronizing them, which Tilling never
      could stand, she had been giving them treats, just like
      that! She had sent out cards for an evening party (not
      dinner at all) with <i>'un po' di musica'</i> written in
      the left-hand corner. Even Mr Wyse, that notorious
      sycophant, had raised his eyebrows over this, and had
      allowed that this was rather an unusual inscription:
      <i>'musica'</i> (he thought) would have been more ordinary,
      and he would ask Amelia when she came. That had confirmed a
      secret suspicion which Miss Mapp had long entertained that
      Lucia's Italian (and, of course, Georgie's too) was really
      confined to such words as '<i>ecco'</i> and <i>'bon
      giorno'</i> and <i>'bello'</i> and she was earnestly hoping
      that Amelia would come before October was over, and they
      would all see what these great talks in Italian, to which
      Mr Wyse was so looking forward, would amount to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what an evening that 'po-di-mu' (as it was already
      referred to with faint little smiles) had been! It was a
      wet night and in obedience to her command (for at that time
      Lucia was at the height of the ascendancy she had acquired
      at the hospital fête), they had all put mackintoshes over
      their evening clothes, and galoshes over their evening
      shoes, and slopped up to Mallards through the pouring rain.
      A couple of journeys of Lucia's car could have brought them
      all in comfort and dryness, but she had not offered so
      obvious a convenience. Mrs Wyse's Royce was being
      overhauled, so they had to walk too, and a bedraggled and
      discontented company had assembled. They had gone into the
      garden-room dripped on by the wistaria, and an interminable
      po-di-mu ensued. Lucia turned off all the lights in the
      room except one on the piano, so that they saw her profile
      against a black background, like the head on a postage
      stamp, and first she played the slow movement out of the
      'Moonlight' Sonata. She stopped once, just after she had
      begun, because Diva coughed, and when she had finished
      there was a long silence. Lucia sighed and Georgie sighed,
      and everyone said 'Thank you' simultaneously. Major Benjy
      said he was devoted to Chopin and Lucia playfully told him
      that she would take his musical education in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had allowed the lights to be turned up again, and
      there was a few minutes' pause to enable them to conquer
      the poignancy of emotion aroused by that exquisite
      rendering of the 'Moonlight' Sonata, to disinfect it so to
      speak with cigarettes, or drown it, as Major Benjy did, in
      rapid whiskies and sodas, and when they felt braver the
      po-di-mu began again, with a duet, between her and Georgie,
      of innumerable movements by Mozart, who must indeed have
      been a most prolific composer if he wrote all that. Diva
      fell quietly asleep, and presently there were indications
      that she would soon be noisily asleep. Miss Mapp hoped that
      she would begin to snore properly, for that would be a good
      set-down for Lucia, but Major Benjy poked her stealthily on
      the knee to rouse her. Mr Wyse began to stifle yawns,
      though he sat as upright as ever, with his eyes fixed
      rather glassily on the ceiling, and ejaculated 'Charming'
      at the end of every movement. When it was all over there
      were some faintly murmured requests that Lucia would play
      to them again, and without any further pressing, she sat
      down. Her obtuseness was really astounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How you all work me!' she said. 'A fugue by Bach then, if
      you insist on it, and if Georgie will promise not to scold
      me if I break down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily amid suppressed sighs of relief, she did break
      down, and though she was still perfectly willing to try
      again, there was a general chorus of unwillingness to take
      advantage of her great good nature, and after a wretched
      supper, consisting largely of tomato-salad, they trooped
      out into the rain, cheered by the promise of another
      musical evening next week when she would have that
      beautiful fugue by heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the next week but the same week that they had
      all been bidden to a further evening of harmony, and
      symptoms of revolt, skilfully fomented by Miss Mapp, were
      observable. She had just received her note of invitation
      one morning, when Diva trundled in to Wasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Another po-di-mu already,' said she sarcastically. 'What
      are you--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Isn't it unfortunate?' interrupted Elizabeth, 'for I hope,
      dear Diva, you have not forgotten that you promised to come
      in that very night--Thursday, isn't it--and play piquet
      with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva returned Elizabeth's elaborate wink. 'So I did,' she
      said. 'Anyhow, I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Consequently we shall have to refuse dear Lucia's
      invitation,' said Elizabeth regretfully. 'Lovely, wasn't
      it, the other night? And so many movements of Mozart. I
      began to think he must have discovered the secret of
      perpetual motion, and that we should be stuck there till
      Doomsday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva was fidgeting about the room in her restless manner.
      ('Rather like a spinning top,' thought Miss Mapp, 'bumping
      into everything. I wish it would die.')
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think she plays bridge very well,' said Diva. 'She
      began, you know, by saying she was so anxious to learn, and
      that we all played marvellously, but now she lays down the
      law like anything, telling us what we ought to have
      declared, and how we ought to have played. It's quite
      like--'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to say 'It's quite like playing with you,'
      but luckily stopped in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't had the privilege of playing with her. Evidently
      I'm not up to her form,' said Elizabeth, 'but I hear, only
      report, mind, that she doesn't know the elements of the
      game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, not much more,' said Diva. 'And she says she will
      start a bridge class if we like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She spoils us! And who will the pupils be?' asked
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know one who won't,' said Diva darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And one and one make two,' observed Elizabeth. 'A pity
      that she sets herself up like that. Saying the other night
      that she would take Major Benjy's musical education in
      hand! I always thought education began at home, and I'm
      sure I never heard so many wrong notes in my life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva ruminated a moment, and began spinning again. 'She
      offered to take the choir-practices in church, only the
      Padre wouldn't hear of it,' she said. 'And there's talk of
      a class to read Homer in Pope's translation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has every accomplishment,' said Elizabeth, 'including
      push.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva bumped into another topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I met Mr Wyse just now,' she said. 'Countess Amelia
      Faraglione is coming to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not really?' she cried. 'Why, she'll be here for Lucia's
      po-di-mu on Thursday. And the Wyses will be going, that's
      certain, and they are sure to ask if they may bring the
      Faradidleone with them. Diva, dear, we must have our piquet
      another night. I wouldn't miss that for anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just think what will happen! She'll be forced to talk
      Italian, for Mr Wyse has often said what a treat it will be
      to hear them talk it together, and I'm sure Lucia doesn't
      know any. I must be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But if she does know it, it will be rather a sell,' said
      Diva. 'We shall have gone there for nothing except to hear
      all that Mozart over again and to eat tomatoes. I had
      heart-burn half the night afterwards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trust me, Diva,' said Elizabeth. 'I swear she doesn't know
      any Italian. And how on earth will she be able to wriggle
      out of talking it? With all her ingeniousness, it can't be
      done. She can't help being exposed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that would be rather amusing,' said Diva. 'Being put
      down a peg or two certainly wouldn't hurt her. All right.
      I'll say I'll come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp's policy was now of course the exact reverse of
      what she had first planned. Instead of scheming to get all
      Tilling to refuse Lucia's invitation to listen to another
      po-di-mu, her object was to encourage everyone to go, in
      order that they might listen not so much to Mozart as to
      her rich silences or faltering replies when challenged to
      converse in the Italian language. She found that the Padre
      and Mrs Bartlett had hurriedly arranged a choir-practice
      and a meeting of the girl-guides respectively to take place
      at the unusual hour of half-past nine in the evening in
      order to be able to decline the po-di-mu, but Elizabeth,
      throwing economy to the winds, asked them both to dine with
      her on the fatal night, and come on to Lucia's delicious
      music afterwards. This added inducement prevailed, and off
      they scurried to tell choir-boys and girl-guides that the
      meetings were cancelled and would be held at the usual hour
      the day after. The curate needed no persuasion, for he
      thought that Lucia had a wonderful touch on the piano, and
      was already looking forward to more; Irene similarly had
      developed a violent <i>schwärm</i> for Lucia and had
      accepted, so that Tilling, thanks to Elizabeth's friendly
      offices, would now muster in force to hear Lucia play duets
      and fugues and not speak Italian. And when, in casual
      conversation with Mr Wyse, Elizabeth learned that he had
      (as she had anticipated) ventured to ask Lucia if she would
      excuse the presumption of one of her greatest admirers, and
      allow him to bring his sister Amelia to her <i>soirée</i>
      and that Lucia had sent him her most cordial permission to
      do so, it seemed that nothing could stand in the way of the
      fulfilment of Elizabeth's romantic revenge on that upstart
      visitor for presuming to set herself up as Queen of the
      social life of Tilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as need hardly be explained, this aspect of the
      affair which so strongly appealed to the sporting instincts
      of the place. Miss Mapp had long been considered by others
      as well as herself the first social citizen of Tilling, and
      though she had often been obliged to fight desperately for
      her position, and had suffered from time to time manifold
      reverses, she had managed to maintain it, because there was
      no one else of so commanding and unscrupulous a character.
      Then, this alien from Riseholme had appeared and had not so
      much challenged her as just taken her sceptre and her crown
      and worn them now for a couple of months. At present all
      attempts to recapture them had failed, but Lucia had grown
      a little arrogant, she had offered to take choir-practice,
      she had issued her invitations (so thought Tilling) rather
      as if they had been commands, and Tilling would not have
      been sorry to see her suffer some set-back. Nobody wanted
      to turn out in the evening to hear her play Mozart (except
      the curate), no one intended to listen to her read Pope's
      translation of Homer's <i>Iliad,</i> or to be instructed
      how to play bridge, and though Miss Mapp was no favourite,
      they would have liked to see her score. But there was
      little partisanship; it was the sporting instinct which
      looked forward to witnessing an engagement between two
      well-equipped Queens, and seeing whether one really could
      speak Italian or not, even if they had to listen to all the
      fugues of Bach first. Everyone, finally, except Miss Mapp,
      wherever their private sympathies might lie, regretted that
      now in less than a month, Lucia would have gone back to her
      own kingdom of Riseholme, where it appeared she had no
      rival of any sort, for these encounters were highly
      stimulating to students of human nature and haters of Miss
      Mapp. Never before had Tilling known so exciting a season.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On this mellow morning, then, of October, Lucia, after
      practising her fugue for the coming po-di-mu, and observing
      Coplen bring into the house a wonderful supply of tomatoes,
      had received that appalling note from Mr Wyse, conveyed by
      the Royce, asking if he might bring Contessa Amelia di
      Faraglione to the musical party to which he so much looked
      forward. The gravity of the issue was instantly clear to
      Lucia, for Mr Wyse had made no secret about the pleasure it
      would give him to hear his sister and herself mellifluously
      converse in the Italian tongue, but without hesitation she
      sent back a note by the chauffeur and the Royce, that she
      would be charmed to see the Contessa. There was no getting
      out of that, and she must accept the inevitable before
      proceeding irresistibly to deal with it. From the window
      she observed the Royce backing and advancing and backing
      till it managed to turn and went round the corner to
      Porpoise Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia closed the piano, for she had more cosmic concerns to
      think about than the fingerings of a fugue. Her party of
      course (that required no consideration) would have to be
      cancelled, but that was only one point in the problem that
      confronted her. For that baleful bilinguist the Contessa di
      Faraglione was not coming to Tilling (all the way from
      Italy) for one night but she was to stay here so Mr Wyse's
      note had mentioned, for 'about a week', after which she
      would pay visits to her relations the Wyses of Whitchurch
      and others. So for a whole week (or about) Lucia would be
      in perpetual danger of being called upon to talk Italian.
      Indeed, the danger was more than mere danger, for if
      anything in this world was certain, it was that Mr Wyse
      would ask her to dinner during this week, and exposure
      would follow. Complete disappearance from Tilling during
      the Contessa's sojourn here was the only possible plan, yet
      how was that to be accomplished? Her house at Riseholme was
      let, but even if it had not been, she could not leave
      Tilling tomorrow, when she had invited everybody to a party
      in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck noon: she had meditated for a full
      half-hour, and now she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can only think of influenza,' she said to herself. 'But
      I shall consult Georgie. A man might see it from another
      angle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at once to her SOS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Georgino mio,'</i> began Lucia, but then suddenly
      corrected herself. 'Georgie,' she said. 'Something very
      disagreeable. The Contessa Thingummy is coming to the Wyses
      tomorrow, and he's asked me if he may bring her to our
      <i>musica.</i> I had to say yes; no way out of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was often very perceptive. He saw what this meant
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Lord,' he said. 'Can't you put it off? Sprain your
      thumb.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's angle was not being of much use so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a bit of good,' she said. 'She'll be here about a
      week, and naturally I have to avoid meeting her altogether.
      The only thing I can think of is influenza.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie never smoked in the morning, but the situation
      seemed to call for a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would do it,' he said. 'Rather a bore for you, but
      you could live in the secret garden a good deal. It's not
      overlooked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped: the unusual tobacco had stimulated his
      perceptive powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what about me?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure I don't know,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're not looking far enough,' said Georgie. 'You're not
      taking the long view which you so often talk to me about. I
      can't have influenza too, it would be too suspicious. So
      I'm bound to meet the Faraglione and she'll see in a minute
      I can't talk Italian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?' said Lucia in a very selfish manner, as if he
      didn't matter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'm not thinking about myself only,' said Georgie in
      self-defence. 'Not so at all. It'll react on you. You and I
      are supposed to talk Italian together, and when it's
      obvious I can't say more than three things in it, the fat's
      in the fire, however much influenza you have. How are you
      going to be supposed to jabber away in Italian to me when
      it's seen that I can't understand a word of it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was the male angle, and an extremely awkward
      angle it was. For a moment Lucia covered her face with her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, what are we to do?' she asked in a stricken
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was a little ruffled at having been considered of
      such absolute unimportance until he pointed out to Lucia
      that her fate was involved with his, and it pleased him to
      echo her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure I don't know,' he said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia hastened to smooth his smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, I'm so glad I thought of consulting you,' she
      said. 'I knew it would take a man's mind to see all round
      the question, and how right you are! I never thought of
      that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite,' said Georgie. 'It's evident you haven't grasped
      the situation at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She paced up and down the garden-room in silence, recoiling
      once from the window, as she saw Elizabeth go by and kiss
      her hand with that awful hyena grin of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, 'oo not cross with poor Lucia?' she said,
      resorting to the less dangerous lingo which they used in
      happier days. This softened Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was rather,' said Georgie, 'but never mind that now.
      What am I to do? <i>Che faro,</i> in fact.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, for goodness' sake, don't talk Italian,' she said.
      'It's that we've got to avoid. It's odd that we have to
      break ourselves of the habit of doing something we can't do
      . . . And you can't have influenza too. It would be too
      suspicious if you began simultaneously with me to-morrow.
      I've often wondered, now I come to think of it, if that
      woman, that Mapp, hasn't suspected that our Italian was a
      fake, and if we both had influenza exactly as the
      Faraglione arrived, she might easily put two and two
      together. Her mind is horrid enough for anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know she suspects,' said Georgie. 'She said some word in
      Italian to me the other day, which meant paper-knife, and
      she looked surprised when I didn't understand, and said it
      in English. Of course, she had looked it out in a
      dictionary: it was a trap.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A flood of horrid light burst in on Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie,' she cried. 'She tried me with the same word.
      I've forgotten it again, but it did mean paper-knife. I
      didn't know it either, though I pretended it was her
      pronunciation that puzzled me. There's no end to her
      craftiness. But I'll get the better of her yet. I think
      you'll have to go away, while the Faraglione is here and I
      have influenza.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I don't want to go away,' began Georgie. 'Surely we
      can think of--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paid no heed to this attempt at protest: it is
      doubtful if she even heard it, for the spark was lit now,
      and it went roaring through her fertile brain like a
      prairie fire in a high gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must go away to-morrow,' she said. 'Far better than
      influenza, and you must stop away till I send you a
      telegram, that the Faraglione has left. It will be very
      dull for me because I shall be entirely confined to the
      house and garden all the time you are gone. I think the
      garden will be safe. I cannot remember that it is
      overlooked from any other house and I shall do a lot of
      reading, though even the piano won't be possible . . .
      Georgie, I see it all. You have not been looking very well
      lately (my dear, you're the picture of health really, I
      have never seen you looking younger or better) and so you
      will have gone off to have a week at Folkestone or
      Littlestone, whichever you prefer. Sea air; you needn't
      bathe. And you can take my car, for I shan't be able to use
      it, and why not take Foljambe as well to valet you, as you
      often do when you go for a jaunt? She'll have her Cadman:
      we may as well make other people happy, Georgie, as it all
      seems to fit in so beautifully. And one thing more: this
      little jaunt of yours is entirely undertaken for my sake,
      and I must insist on paying it all. Go to a nice hotel and
      make yourself thoroughly comfortable; half a bottle of
      champagne whenever you want it in the evening, and what
      extras you like, and I will telephone to you to say when
      you can come back. You must start to-morrow morning before
      the Faraglione gets here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie knew it was useless to protest when Lucia got that
      loud, inspired, gabbling ring in her voice; she would cut
      through any opposition, as a steam saw buzzes through the
      most solid oak board till, amid a fountain of flying
      sawdust, it has sliced its way. He did not want to go away,
      but when Lucia exhibited that calibre of determination that
      he should, it was better to yield at once than to collapse
      later in a state of wretched exhaustion. Besides, there
      were bright points in her scheme. Foljambe would be
      delighted at the plan, for it would give her and Cadman
      leisure to enjoy each other's society; and it would not be
      disagreeable to stay for a week at some hotel in Folkestone
      and observe the cargoes of travellers from abroad arriving
      at the port after a billowy passage. Then he might find
      some bibelots in the shops, and he would listen to a
      municipal band, and have a bathroom next his bedroom, and
      do some sketches, and sit in a lounge in a series of those
      suits which had so justly earned him the title of the
      best-dressed man in Tilling. He would have a fine
      Rolls-Royce in the hotel garage, and a smart chauffeur
      coming to ask for orders every morning, and he would be
      seen, an interesting and opulent figure, drinking his
      half-bottle of champagne every evening and he would
      possibly pick up an agreeable aquaintance or two. He had no
      hesitation whatever in accepting Lucia's proposal to stand
      the charges of this expedition, for, as she had most truly
      said, it was undertaken in her interests, and naturally she
      paid (besides, she was quite rich) for its equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main lines of this defensive campaign being thus laid
      down, Lucia, with her Napoleonic eye for detail, plunged
      into minor matters. She did not, of course, credit 'that
      Mapp' with having procured the visit of the Faraglione, but
      a child could see that if she herself met the Faraglione
      during her stay here the grimmest exposure of her ignorance
      of the language she talked in such admired snippets must
      inevitably follow. 'That Mapp' would pounce on this, and it
      was idle to deny that she would score heavily and horribly.
      But Georgie's absence (cheap at the cost) and her own
      invisibility by reason of influenza made a seemingly
      unassailable position and it was with a keen sense of
      exhilaration in the coming contest that she surveyed the
      arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sent for the trusty Grosvenor and confided in her
      sufficiently to make her a conspirator. She told her that
      she had a great mass of arrears to do in reading and
      writing, and that for the next week she intended to devote
      herself to them, and lead the life of a hermit. She wanted
      no callers, and did not mean to see anyone, and the easiest
      excuse was to say that she had influenza. No doubt there
      would be many inquiries, and so day by day she would issue
      to Grosvenor her own official bulletin. Then she told
      Cadman that Mr Georgie was far from well, and she had
      bundled him off with the car to Folkestone for about a
      week: he and Foljambe would accompany him. Then she made a
      careful survey of the house and garden to ascertain what
      freedom of movement she could have during her illness.
      Playing the piano, except very carefully with the soft
      pedal down, would be risky, but by a judicious adjustment
      of the curtains in the garden-room window, she could
      refresh herself with very satisfactory glances at the world
      outside. The garden, she was pleased to notice, was quite
      safe, thanks to its encompassing walls, from any prying
      eyes in the houses round: the top of the church tower alone
      overlooked it, and that might be disregarded, for only
      tourists ascended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then forth she went for the usual shoppings and chats in
      the High Street and put in some further fine work. The
      morning tide was already on the ebb, but by swift flirtings
      this way and that she managed to have a word with most of
      those who were coming to her po-di-mu tomorrow, and
      interlarded all she said to them with brilliant scraps of
      Italian. She just caught the Wyses as they were getting
      back into the Royce and said how <i>molto amabile</i> it
      was of them to give her the <i>gran' piacere</i> of seeing
      the Contessa next evening: indeed she would be a welcome
      guest, and it would be another <i>gran' piacere</i> to talk
      <i>la bella lingua</i> again. Georgie, alas, would not be
      there for he was <i>un po' ammalato,</i> and was going to
      spend a <i>settimana</i> by the <i>mare per stabilirsi.</i>
      Never had she been so fluent and idiomatic, and she
      accepted with <i>mille grazie</i> Susan's invitation to
      dine the evening after her music and renew the
      conversations to which she so much looked forward. She got
      almost tipsy with Italian . . . Then she flew across the
      street to tell the curate that she was going to shut
      herself up all afternoon in order to get the Bach fugue
      more worthy of his critical ear, she told Diva to come
      early to her party in order that they might have a little
      chat first, and she just managed by a flute-like 'Cooee' to
      arrest Elizabeth as she was on the very doorstep of
      Wasters. With glee she learned that Elizabeth was
      entertaining the Padre and his wife and Major Benjy to
      dinner before she brought them on to her party, and then,
      remembering the trap which that woman had laid for her and
      Georgie over the Italian paper-knife, she could not refrain
      from asking her to dine and play bridge on the third night
      of her coming illness. Of course she would be obliged to
      put her off, and that would be about square . . . This
      half-hour's active work produced the impression that,
      however little pleasure Tilling anticipated from
      to-morrow's po-di-mu, the musician herself looked forward
      to it enormously, and was thirsting to talk Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window of her bedroom next morning Lucia saw
      Georgie and Cadman and Foljambe set off for Folkestone, and
      it was with a Lucretian sense of pleasure in her own coming
      tranquillity that she contemplated the commotion and
      general upset of plans which was shortly to descend on
      Tilling. She went to the garden-room, adjusted the curtains
      and brewed the tempest which she now sent forth in the
      shape of a series of notes charged with the bitterest
      regrets. They were written in pencil (the consummate
      artist) as if from bed, and were traced in a feeble hand
      not like her usual firm script. 'What a disappointment!'
      she wrote to Mrs Wyse. 'How cruel to have got the
      influenza--where could she have caught it?--on the very
      morning of her party, and what a blow not to be able to
      welcome the Contessa today or to dine with dear Susan
      tomorrow!' There was another note to Major Benjy, and
      others to Diva and quaint Irene and the curate and the
      Padre and Elizabeth. She still hoped that possibly she
      might be well enough for bridge and dinner the day after
      tomorrow, but Elizabeth must remember how infectious
      influenza was, and again she herself might not be well
      enough. That seemed pretty safe, for Elizabeth had a
      frantic phobia of infection, and Wasters had reeked of
      carbolic all the time the jumble-sale was being held, for
      fear of some bit of rubbish having come in contact with
      tainted hands. Lucia gave these notes to Grosvenor for
      immediate delivery and told her that the bulletin for the
      day in answer to callers was that there was no anxiety, for
      the attack though sharp was not serious, and only demanded
      warmth and complete quiet. She then proceeded to get both
      by sitting in this warm October sun in her garden, reading
      Pope's translation of the <i>Iliad</i> and seeing what the
      Greek for it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three impregnable days passed thus. From behind the
      adjusted curtains of the garden-room she observed the
      coming of many callers and Grosvenor's admirable demeanour
      to them. The Royce lurched up the street, and there was
      Susan in her sables, and, sitting next her, a vivacious
      gesticulating woman with a monocle, who looked the sort of
      person who could talk at the most appalling rate. This
      without doubt was the fatal Contessa, and Lucia felt that
      to see her thus was like observing a lion at large from
      behind the bars of a comfortable cage. Miss Mapp on the
      second day came twice, and each time she glanced piercingly
      at the curtains, as if she knew that trick, and listened as
      if hoping to hear the sound of the piano. The Padre sent a
      note almost entirely in Highland dialect, the curate turned
      away from the door with evident relief in his face at the
      news he had received, and whistled the Bach fugue rather
      out of tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifth day of her illness new interests sprang up for
      Lucia that led her to neglect Pope's <i>Iliad</i>
      altogether. By the first post there came a letter from
      Georgie, containing an enclosure which Lucia saw (with a
      slight misgiving) was written in Italian. She turned first
      to Georgie's letter.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The most wonderful thing has happened [wrote Georgie] and
      you will be pleased . . . There's a family here with whom
      I've made friends, an English father, an Italian mother and
      a girl with a pigtail. Listen! The mother teaches the girl
      Italian, and sets her little themes to write on some
      subject or other, and then corrects them and writes a fair
      copy. Well, I was sitting in the lounge this morning while
      the girl was having her lesson, and Mrs Brocklebank (that's
      her name) asked me to suggest a subject for the theme, and
      I had the most marvellous idea. I said 'Let her write a
      letter to an Italian Countess whom she has never seen
      before, and say how she regretted having been obliged to
      put off her musical party to which she had asked the
      Countess and her brother, because she had caught influenza.
      She was so sorry not to meet her, and she was afraid that
      as the Countess was only staying a week in the place, she
      would not have the pleasure of seeing her at all.' Mrs B.
      thought that would do beautifully for a theme, and I
      repeated it over again to make sure. Then the girl wrote
      it, and Mrs B. corrected it and made a fair copy. I begged
      her to give it me, because I adored Italian (though I
      couldn't speak it) and it was so beautifully expressed. I
      haven't told this very well, because I'm in a hurry to
      catch the post, but I enclose Mrs B.'s Italian letter, and
      you just see whether it doesn't do the trick too
      marvellously. I'm having quite a gay time, music and drives
      and seeing the Channel boat come in, and aren't I clever?
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      Your devoted,
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      Georgie
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe and Cadman have had a row, but I'm afraid they've
      made it up.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, with her misgivings turned to joyful expectation,
      seized and read the enclosure. Indeed it was a miraculous
      piece of manna to one whom the very sight of it made
      hungry. It might have been the result of telepathy between
      Mrs Brocklebank and her own subconscious self, so aptly did
      that lady grasp her particular unspoken need. It expressed
      in the most elegant idiom precisely what met the situation,
      and she would copy out and send it to-day, without altering
      a single word. And how clever of Georgie to have thought of
      it. He deserved all the champagne he could drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia used her highest art in making a copy (on Mallard
      paper) of this document, as if writing hastily in a
      familiar medium. Occasionally she wrote a word (it did not
      matter what), erased it so as to render it illegible to the
      closest scrutiny, and then went on with Mrs Brocklebank's
      manuscript; occasionally she omitted a word of it and then
      inserted it with suitable curves of direction above. No one
      receiving her transcript could imagine that it was other
      than her own extempore scribble. Mrs Brocklebank had said
      that in two or three days she hoped to be able to see her
      friends again, and that fitted beautifully, because in two
      or three days now the Contessa's visit would have come to
      an end, and Lucia could get quite well at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second post arrived before Lucia had finished this
      thoughtful copy. There was a letter in Lady Brixton's
      handwriting, and hastily scribbling the final florid
      salutations to the Contessa, she opened this, and thereupon
      forgot Georgie and Mrs Brocklebank and everything else in
      the presence of the tremendous question which was brought
      for her decision. Adele had simply fallen in love with
      Riseholme; she affirmed that life was no longer worth
      living without a house there, and, of all houses, she would
      like best to purchase, unfurnished, the Hurst. Failing that
      there was another that would do, belonging to round red
      little Mrs Quantock, who, she had ascertained, might
      consider selling it. Could darling Lucia therefore let her
      know with the shortest possible delay whether she would be
      prepared to sell the Hurst? If she had no thought of doing
      so Adele would begin tempting Mrs Quantock at once. But if
      she had, let genteel indications about price be outlined at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain processes of mental solidification which
      take place with extraordinary rapidity, because the system
      is already soaked and super-saturated with the issues
      involved. It was so now with Lucia. Instantly, on the
      perusal of Adele's inquiries her own mind solidified. She
      had long been obliquely contemplating some such step as
      Adele's letter thrust in front of her, and she was
      surprised to find that her decision was already made.
      Riseholme, once so vivid and significant, had during these
      weeks at Tilling been fading like an ancient photograph
      exposed to the sun, and all its features, foregrounds and
      backgrounds had grown blurred and dim. If she went back to
      Riseholme at the end of the month, she would find there
      nothing to occupy her energies, or call out her unique
      powers of self-assertion. She had so swept the board with
      her management of the Elizabethan fête that no further
      progress was possible. Poor dear Daisy might occasionally
      make some minute mutinies, but after being Drake's wife
      (what a lesson for her!) there would be no real fighting
      spirit left in her. It was far better, while her own
      energies still bubbled within her, to conquer this fresh
      world of Tilling than to smoulder at Riseholme. Her work
      there was done, whereas here, as this week of influenza
      testified, there was a very great deal to do. Elizabeth
      Mapp was still in action and capable of delivering
      broadsides; innumerable crises might still arise, volcanoes
      smoked, thunder-clouds threatened, there were hostile and
      malignant forces to be thwarted. She had never been better
      occupied and diverted, the place suited her, and it
      bristled with opportunities. She wrote to Adele at once
      saying that dear as Riseholme (and especially the Hurst)
      was to her, she was prepared to be tempted, and indicated a
      sum before which she was likely to fall.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp by this fifth day of Lucia's illness was
      completely baffled. She did not yet allow herself to
      despair of becoming unbaffled, for she was certain that
      there was a mystery here, and every mystery had an
      explanation if you only worked at it enough. The
      coincidence of Lucia's illness with the arrival of the
      Contessa and Georgie's departure, supported by the trap she
      had laid about the paper-knife, was far too glaring to be
      overlooked by any constructive mind, and there must be
      something behind it. Only a foolish ingenuous child (and
      Elizabeth was anything but that) could have considered
      these as isolated phenomena. With a faith that would have
      removed mountains, she believed that Lucia was perfectly
      well, but all she had been able to do at present was to
      recite her creed to Major Benjy and Diva and others, and
      eagerly wait for any shred of evidence to support it.
      Attempts to pump Grosvenor and lynx-like glances at the
      window of the garden-room had yielded nothing, and her
      anxious inquiry addressed to Dr Dobbie, the leading
      physician of Tilling, had yielded a snub. She did not know
      who Lucia's doctor was, so with a view to ascertaining
      that, and possibly getting other information, she had
      approached him with her most winning smile, and asked how
      the dear patient at Mallards was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not attending any dear patient at Mallards,' had been
      his unpromising reply, 'and if I was I need hardly remind
      you that, as a professional man, I should not dream of
      answering any inquiry about my patients without their
      express permission to do so. Good morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very rude man,' thought Miss Mapp, 'but perhaps I had
      better not try to get at it that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at the church, wondering if she would find
      inspiration in that beautiful grey tower, which she had so
      often sketched, outlined against the pellucid blue of the
      October sky. She found it instantly, for she remembered
      that the leads at the top of it which commanded so broad a
      view of the surrounding country commanded also a perfectly
      wonderful view of her own little secret garden. It was a
      small chance, but no chance however small must be neglected
      in this famine of evidence, and it came to her in a flash
      that there could be no more pleasant way of spending the
      morning than making a sketch of the green, green marsh and
      the line of the blue, blue sea beyond. She hurried back to
      Wasters, pausing only at Mallards to glance at the
      garden-room where the curtains were adjusted in the most
      exasperatingly skilful manner, and to receive Grosvenor's
      assurance that the patient's temperature was quite normal
      today.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that is good news,' said Miss Mapp. 'Then tomorrow
      perhaps she will be about again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't say, miss,' said Grosvenor, holding on to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give her my fondest love,' said Miss Mapp, 'and tell her
      how rejoiced I am, please, Grosvenor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, miss,' said Grosvenor, and before Miss Mapp could
      step from the threshold, she heard the rattle of the chain
      behind the closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to lunch that day with the Wyses, a meal
      which Mr Wyse, in his absurd affected fashion, always
      alluded to as breakfast, especially when the Contessa was
      staying with them. Breakfast was at one, but there was time
      for an hour at the top of the church tower first. In order
      to see the features of the landscape better, she took up an
      opera-glass with her sketching things. She first put a blue
      watery wash on her block for the sky and sea, and a green
      one for the marsh, and while these were drying she examined
      every nook of her garden with the opera-glass. No luck, and
      she picked up her sketch again on which the sky was rapidly
      inundating the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had learned this morning <i>via</i> Grosvenor and her
      cook and Figgis, Mr Wyse's butler, that the week of the
      Contessa's stay here was to be curtailed by one day and
      that the Royce would convey her to Whitchurch next morning
      on her visit to the younger but ennobled branch of the
      family. Further intelligence from the same source made
      known that the breakfast to-day to which Miss Mapp was
      bidden was a Belshazzar breakfast, eight if not ten. This
      was good news: the period of Lucia's danger of detection
      would be over in less than twenty-four hours, and about the
      time that Miss Mapp at the top of the tower of Tilling
      Church was hastily separating the firmament from the dry
      land, Lucia wrote out a telegram to Georgie that he might
      return the following day and find all clear. Together with
      that she sent a request to Messrs Woolgar &amp; Pipstow
      that they should furnish her with an order to view a
      certain house she had seen just outside Tilling, near
      quaint Irene's cottage, which she had observed was for
      sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated about giving Grosvenor the envelope addressed
      to Contessa di Faraglione, which contained the transcript,
      duly signed, of Mrs Brocklebank's letter to a Countess, and
      decided, on the score of dramatic fitness, to have it
      delivered shortly after one o'clock when Mrs Wyse's
      breakfast would be in progress, with orders that it should
      be presented to the Contessa at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was feeling the want of vigorous exercise, and
      bethought herself of the <i>Ideal System of Callisthenics
      for those no longer Young.</i> For five days she had been
      confined to house and garden, and the craving to skip took
      possession of her. Skipping was an exercise highly
      recommended by the ideal system, and she told Grosvenor to
      bring back for her, with the order to view from Messrs
      Woolgar &amp; Pipstow, a simple skipping-rope from the
      toy-shop in the High Street. While Grosvenor was gone this
      desire for free active movement in the open air awoke a
      kindred passion for the healthful action of the sun on the
      skin, and she hurried up to her sick-room, changed into a
      dazzling bathing-suit of black and yellow, and, putting on
      a very smart dressing-gown gay with ribands, was waiting in
      the garden-room when Grosvenor returned, recalling to her
      mind the jerks and swayings which had kept her in such
      excellent health when grief forbade her to play golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was a quarter to one when Lucia tripped into the
      secret garden, shed her dressing-gown and began skipping on
      the little lawn with the utmost vigour. The sound of the
      church clock immediately below Miss Mapp's eyrie on the
      tower warned her that it was time to put her sketching
      things away, deposit them at Wasters and go out to
      breakfast. During the last half-hour she had cast
      periodical but fruitless glances at her garden, and had
      really given it up as a bad job. Now she looked down once
      more, and there close beside the bust of good Queen Anne
      was a gay striped figure of waspish colours skipping away
      like mad. She dropped her sketch, she reached out a
      trembling hand for her opera-glasses, the focus of which
      was already adjusted to a nicety, and by their aid she saw
      that this athletic wasp who was skipping with such
      exuberant activity was none other than the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp gave a shrill crow of triumph. All came to him
      who waited, and if she had known Greek she would
      undoubtedly have exclaimed 'Eureka': as it was she only
      crowed. It was all too good to be true, but it was all too
      distinct not to be. 'Now I've got her,' she thought. 'The
      whole thing is as clear as daylight. I was right all the
      time. She has not had influenza any more than I, and I'll
      tell everybody at breakfast what I have seen.' But the
      sight still fascinated her. What shameless vigour, when she
      should have been languid with fever! What abysses of
      falsehood, all because she could not talk Italian! What
      expense to herself in that unnecessary dinner to the Padre
      and Major Benjy! There was no end to it . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia stalked about the lawn with a high prancing motion
      when she had finished her skipping. Then she skipped again,
      and then she made some odd jerks, as if she was being
      electrocuted. She took long deep breaths, she lifted her
      arms high above her head as if to dive, she lay down on the
      grass and kicked, she walked on tiptoe like a ballerina,
      she swung her body round from the hips. All this had for
      Miss Mapp the fascination that flavours strong disgust and
      contempt. Eventually, just as the clock struck one, she
      wrapped herself in her dressing-gown, the best was clearly
      over. Miss Mapp was already late, and she must hurry
      straight from the tower to her breakfast, for there was no
      time to go back to Wasters first. She would be profuse in
      pretty apologies for her lateness; the view from the church
      tower had been so entrancing (this was perfectly true) that
      she had lost all count of time. She could not show her
      sketch to the general company, because the firmament had
      got dreadfully muddled up with the waters which were below
      it, but instead she would tell them something which would
      muddle up Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast-party was all assembled in Mrs Wyse's
      drawing-room with its dark oak beams and its silver-framed
      photographs and its morocco case containing the order of
      the MBE, still negligently open. Everybody had been
      waiting, everybody was rather grumpy at the delay, and on
      her entry the Contessa had clearly said <i>'Ecco!</i> Now
      at last!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They would soon forgive her when they learned what had
      really made her late, but it was better to wait for a
      little before imparting her news, until breakfast had put
      them all in a more appreciative mood. She hastened on this
      desired moment by little compliments all round: what a
      wonderful sermon the Padre had preached last Sunday: how
      well dear Susan looked: what a delicious dish these eggs
      <i>à la Capri</i> were, she must really be greedy and take
      a teeny bit more. But these dewdrops were only interjected,
      for the Contessa talked in a loud continuous voice as
      usual, addressing the entire table, and speaking with equal
      fluency whether her mouth was full or empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the opportunity arrived. Figgis brought in a note
      on an immense silver (probably plated) salver, and
      presented it to the Contessa: it was to be delivered at
      once. Amelia said <i>'Scusi'</i> which everybody
      understood--even Lucia might have understood that--and was
      silent for a space as she tore it open and began reading
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp decided to tantalize and excite them all before
      actually making her revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will give anybody three guesses as to what I have seen
      this morning,' she said. 'Mr Wyse, Major Benjy, Padre, you
      must all guess. It is about someone whom we all know, who
      is still an invalid. I was sketching this morning at the
      top of the tower, and happened to glance down into my pet
      little secret garden. And there was Lucia in the middle of
      the lawn. How was she dressed, and what was she doing?
      Three guesses each, shall it be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! The introductory tantalization had been too long, for
      before anybody could guess anything the Contessa broke in
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But never have I read such a letter!' she cried. 'It is
      from Mrs Lucas. All in Italian, and such Italian! Perfect.
      I should not have thought that any foreigner could have had
      such command of idiom and elegance. I have lived in Italy
      for ten years, but my Italian is a bungle compared to this.
      I have always said that no foreigner ever can learn Italian
      perfectly, and Cecco too, but we were wrong. This Mrs Lucas
      proves it. It is composed by the ear, the spoken word on
      paper. <i>Dio mio!</i> What an escape I have had, Algernon!
      You had a plan to bring me and your Mrs Lucas together to
      hear us talk. But she would smile to herself, and I should
      know what she was thinking, for she would be thinking how
      very poorly I talk Italian compared with herself. I will
      read her letter to you all, and though you do not know what
      it means you will recognize a fluency, a music. . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Contessa proceeded to do so, with renewed exclamations
      of amazement, and all that bright edifice of suspicion, so
      carefully reared by the unfortunate Elizabeth, that Lucia
      knew no Italian, collapsed like a house built of cards when
      the table is shaken. Elizabeth had induced everybody to
      accept invitations to the second po-di-mu in order that all
      Tilling might hear Lucia's ignorance exposed by the
      Contessa, and when she had wriggled out of that,
      Elizabeth's industrious efforts had caused the gravest
      suspicions to be entertained that Lucia's illness was
      feigned in order to avoid any encounter with one who did
      know Italian, and now not only was not one pane of that
      Crystal Palace left unshattered, but the Contessa was
      congratulating herself on her own escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth stirred feebly below the ruins: she was not quite
      crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure it sounds lovely,' she said when the recitation
      was over. 'But did not you yourself, dear Mr Wyse, think it
      odd that anyone who knew Italian should put <i>un po' di
      musica</i> on her invitation-card?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then he was wrong,' said the Contessa. 'No doubt that
      phrase is a little humorous quotation from something I do
      not know. Rather like you ladies of Tilling who so
      constantly say "au reservoir". It is not a mistake: it is a
      joke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth made a final effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if dear Lucia wrote that note herself,' she said
      pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pish! Her parlourmaid, doubtless,' said the Contessa. 'For
      me, I must spend an hour this afternoon to see if I can
      answer that letter in a way that will not disgrace me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed little more to be said on that subject and
      Elizabeth hastily resumed her tantalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody has tried to guess yet what I saw from the church
      tower,' she said. 'Major Benjy, you try! It was Lucia, but
      how was she dressed and what was she doing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a coldness about Major Benjy. He had allowed
      himself to suspect, owing to Elizabeth's delicate hints,
      that there was perhaps some Italian mystery behind Lucia's
      influenza, and now he must make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Couldn't say, I'm sure,' he said. 'She was sure to have
      been very nicely dressed from what I know of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll give you a hint then,' said she. 'I've never seen her
      dressed like that before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy's attention completely wandered. He made no
      attempt to guess but sipped his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You then, Mr Wyse, if Major Benjy gives up,' said
      Elizabeth, getting anxious. Though the suspected cause of
      Lucia's illness was disproved, it still looked as if she
      had never had influenza at all, and that was something.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My ingenuity, I am sure, will not be equal to the
      occasion,' said Mr Wyse very politely. 'You will be obliged
      to tell me. I give up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth emitted a shrill little titter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A dressing-gown,' she said. 'A bathing-costume. And she
      was skipping! Fancy! With influenza!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dreadful pause. No babble of excited inquiry
      and comment took place at all. The Contessa put up her
      monocle, focused Elizabeth for a moment, and this pause
      somehow was like the hush that succeeds some slight
      <i>gaffe,</i> some small indelicacy that had better have
      been left unsaid. Her host came to her rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is indeed good news,' said Mr Wyse. 'We may encourage
      ourselves to hope that our friend is well on the road to
      convalescence. Thank you for telling us that, Miss Mapp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Bartlett gave one of her little mouse-like squeals, and
      Irene said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hurrah! I shall try to see her this afternoon. I am glad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That again was an awful thought. Irene no doubt, if
      admitted, would give an account of the luncheon-party which
      would lose nothing in the telling, and she was such a
      ruthless mimic. Elizabeth felt a sinking feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would that be wise, dear?' she said. 'Lucia is probably
      not yet free from infection, and we mustn't have you down
      with it. I wonder where she caught it, by the way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But your point is that she's never had influenza at all,'
      said Irene with that dismal directness of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choking with this monstrous dose of fiasco, Elizabeth made
      for the present no further attempt to cause her friends to
      recoil from the idea of Lucia's skippings, for they only
      rejoiced that she was sufficiently recovered to do so. The
      party presently dispersed, and she walked away with her
      sketching things and Diva, and glanced up the street
      towards her house. Irene was already standing by the door,
      and Elizabeth turned away with a shudder, for Irene waved
      her hand to them and was admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all very strange, dear Diva, isn't it?' she said.
      'It's impossible to believe that Lucia's been ill, and it's
      useless to try to do so. Then there's Mr Georgie's
      disappearance. I never thought of that before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I were you, Elizabeth,' she said, 'I should hold my
      tongue about it all. Much wiser.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed?' said Elizabeth, beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I tell you so as a friend,' continued Diva firmly.
      'You got hold of a false scent. You made us think that
      Lucia was avoiding the Faraglione. All wrong from beginning
      to end. One of your worst shots. Give it up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there is something queer,' said Elizabeth wildly.
      'Skipping--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If there is,' said Diva, 'you're not clever enough to find
      it out. That's my advice. Take it or leave it. I don't
      care. Au reservoir.'
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Had Miss Mapp been able to hear what went on in the
      garden-room that afternoon, as well as she had been able to
      see what had gone on that morning in the garden, she would
      never have found Irene more cruelly quaint. Her account of
      this luncheon-party was more than graphic, for so well did
      she reproduce the Contessa's fervid monologue and poor
      Elizabeth's teasings over what she wanted them all to
      guess, that it positively seemed to be illustrated. Almost
      more exasperating to Miss Mapp would have been Lucia's
      pitiful contempt for the impotence of her malicious
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor thing!' she said. 'Sometimes I think she is a little
      mad. <i>Una pazza: un po' pazza . . .</i> But I regret not
      seeing the Contessa. Nice of her to have approved of my
      scribbled note, and I dare say I should have found that she
      talked Italian very well indeed. To-morrow--for after my
      delicious exercise on the lawn this morning, I do not feel
      up to more to-day--tomorrow I should certainly have hoped
      to call--in the afternoon--and have had a chat with her.
      But she is leaving in the morning, I understand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, looking the picture of vigour and vitality, swept
      across to the curtained window and threw back those
      screenings with a movement that made the curtain-rings
      chime together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor Elizabeth!' she repeated. 'My heart aches for her,
      for I am sure all that carping bitterness makes her
      wretched. I dare say it is only physical: liver perhaps, or
      acidity. The ideal system of callisthenics might do wonders
      for her. I cannot, as you will readily understand, dear
      Irene, make the first approaches to her after her conduct
      to me, and the dreadful innuendoes she has made, but I
      should like her to know that I bear her no malice at all.
      Do convey that to her sometime. Tactfully, of course. Women
      like her who do all they can on every possible occasion to
      hurt and injure others are usually very sensitive
      themselves, and I would not add to the poor creature's
      other chagrins. You must all be kind to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, you're too wonderful!' said Irene, in a sort of
      ecstasy. 'What a joy you are! But, alas, you're leaving us
      so soon. It's too unkind of you to desert us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had dropped on to the music-stool by the piano which
      had so long been dumb, except for a few timorous chords
      muffled by the <i>unsustenuto</i> pedal, and dreamily
      recalled the first bars of the famous slow movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene sat down on the cold hot-water pipes and yearned at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can do everything,' she said. 'You play like an angel,
      and you can knock out Mapp with your little finger, and you
      can skip and play bridge, and you've got such a lovely
      nature that you don't bear Mapp the slightest grudge for
      her foul plots. You are adorable! Won't you ask me to come
      and stay with you at Riseholme sometime?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, still keeping perfect time with her triplets while
      this recital of her perfections was going on, considered
      whether she should not tell Irene at once that she had
      practically determined not to desert them. She had intended
      to tell Georgie first, but she would do that when he came
      back to-morrow, and she wanted to see about getting a house
      here without delay. She played a nimble arpeggio on the
      chord of C sharp minor and closed the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too sweet of you to like me, dear,' she said, 'but as for
      your staying with me at Riseholme, I don't think I shall
      ever go back there myself. I have fallen in love with this
      dear Tilling, and I fully expect I shall settle here for
      good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Angel!' said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been looking about for a house that might suit me,'
      she continued when Irene had finished kissing her, 'and the
      house-agents have just sent me the order to view one which
      particularly attracts me. It's that white house on the road
      that skirts the marsh, half a mile away. A nice garden
      sheltered from the north wind. Right down on the level, it
      is true, but such a divine view. Broad, tranquil! A dyke
      and a bank just across the road, keeping back the high
      tides in the river.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But of course I know it; you mean Grebe,' cried Irene.
      'The cottage I am in now adjoins the garden. Oh, do take
      it! While you're settling in, I'll let Diva have Taormina,
      and Diva will let Mapp have Wasters, and Mapp will let you
      have Mallards till Grebe's ready for you. And I shall be at
      your disposal all day to help you with your furniture.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia decided that there was no real danger of meeting the
      Contessa if she drove out there: besides the Contessa now
      wanted to avoid her for fear of showing how inferior was
      her Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's such a lovely afternoon,' she said, 'that I think a
      little drive would not hurt me. Unfortunately Georgie, who
      comes back to-morrow, has got my car. I lent it him for his
      week by the sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, how like you!' cried Irene. 'Always unselfish!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie! So pleased to give him a little treat,' said
      Lucia. 'I'll ring up the garage and get them to send me
      something closed. Come with me, dear, if you have nothing
      particular to do, and we'll look over the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia found much to attract her in Grebe. Though it was
      close to the road it was not overlooked, for a thick hedge
      of hornbeam made a fine screen: besides, the road did not
      lead anywhere particular. The rooms were of good
      dimensions, there was a hall and dining-room on the ground
      floor, with a broad staircase leading up to the first floor
      where there were two or three bedrooms and a long admirable
      sitting-room with four windows looking across the road to
      the meadows and the high bank bounding the river. Beyond
      that lay the great empty levels of the marsh, with the hill
      of Tilling rising out of it half a mile away to the west.
      Close behind the house was the cliff which had once been
      the coastline before the marshes were drained and
      reclaimed, and this would be a rare protection against
      northerly and easterly winds. All these pleasant rooms
      looked south, and all had this open view away seawards;
      they had character and dignity, and at once Lucia began to
      see herself living here. The kitchen and offices were in a
      wing by themselves, and here again there was character, for
      the kitchen had evidently been a coach-house, and still
      retained the big double doors appropriate to such. There
      had once been a road from it to the end of the kitchen
      garden, but with its disuse as a coach-house, the road had
      been replaced by a broad cinder path now bordered with beds
      of useful vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Ma molto conveniente,'</i> said Lucia more than once,
      for it was now perfectly safe to talk Italian again, since
      the Contessa, no less than she, was determined to avoid a
      duet in that language. <i>'Mi piace molto. E un bel
      giardino.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I love hearing you talk Italian,' ejaculated Irene,
      'especially since I know it's the very best. Will you teach
      it me? Oh, I am so pleased you like the house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I am charmed with it,' said Lucia. 'And there's a
      garage with a very nice cottage attached which will do
      beautifully for Cadman and Foljambe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off suddenly, for in the fervour of her
      enthusiasm for the house, she had not thought about the
      awful catastrophe which must descend on Georgie, if she
      decided to live at Tilling. She had given no direct thought
      to him, and now for the first time she realized the cruel
      blow that would await him, when he came back to-morrow, all
      bronzed from his week at Folkestone. He had been a real
      <i>Deus ex machino</i> to her: his stroke of genius had
      turned a very hazardous moment into a blaze of triumph, and
      now she was going to plunge a dagger into his domestic
      heart by the news that she and therefore Cadman and
      therefore Foljambe were not coming back to Riseholme at all
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, are they going to marry?' asked Irene. 'Or do you mean
      they just live together? How interesting!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Irene, do not be so modern,' said Lucia, quite
      sharply. 'Marriage of course, and banns first. But never
      mind that for the present. I like those great double doors
      to the kitchen. I shall certainly keep them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How ripping that you're thinking about kitchen-doors
      already,' said Irene. 'That really sounds as if you did
      mean to buy the house. Won't Mapp have a fit when she hears
      it! I must be there when she's told. She'll say "Darling
      Lulu, what a joy," and then fall down and foam at the
      mouth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gazed out over the marsh where the level rays of
      sunset turned a few low-lying skeins of mist to rose and
      gold. The tide was high and the broad channel of the river
      running out to sea was brimming from edge to edge. Here and
      there, where the banks were low, the water had overflowed
      on to adjacent margins of land; here and there, spread into
      broad lakes, it lapped the confining dykes. There were
      sheep cropping the meadows, there were seagulls floating in
      the water, and half a mile away to the west the red roofs
      of Tilling glowed as if molten not only with the soft
      brilliance of the evening light, but (to the discerning
      eye) with the intensity of the interests that burned
      beneath them . . . Lucia hardly knew what gave her the most
      satisfaction, the magic of the marsh, her resolve to live
      here, or the recollection of the complete discomfiture of
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again the less happy thought of Georgie recurred, and
      she wondered what arguments she could use to induce him to
      leave Riseholme and settle here. Tilling with all its
      manifold interests would be incomplete without him, and how
      dismally incomplete Riseholme would be to him without
      herself and Foljambe. Georgie had of late taken his
      painting much more seriously than ever before, and he had
      often during the summer put off dinner to an unheard-of
      lateness in order to catch a sunset, and had risen at most
      inconvenient hours to catch a sunrise. Lucia had strongly
      encouraged this zeal, she had told him that if he was to
      make a real career as an artist he had no time to waste.
      Appreciation and spurring-on was what he needed: perhaps
      Irene could help.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to the glowing landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Irene, what would life be without sunsets?' she asked.
      'And to think that this miracle happens every day, except
      when it's very cloudy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked critically at the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Generally speaking, I don't like sunsets,' she said. 'The
      composition of the sky is usually childish. But good
      colouring about this one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There are practically no sunsets at Riseholme,' said
      Lucia. 'I suppose the sun goes down, but there's a row of
      hills in the way. I often think that Georgie's development
      as an artist is starved there. If he goes back there he
      will find no one to make him work. What do you think of his
      painting, dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think of it at all,' said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No? I am astonished. Of course your own is so different in
      character. Those wrestlers! Such movement! But personally I
      find very great perception in Georgie's work. A
      spaciousness, a calmness! I wish you would take an interest
      in it and encourage him. You can find beauty anywhere if
      you look for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I'll do my best if you want me to,' said Irene.
      'But it will be hard work to find beauty in Georgie's
      little valentines.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do try. Give him some hints. Make him see what you see.
      All that boldness and freedom. That's what he wants . . .
      Ah, the sunset is fading. <i>Buona notte, bel sole!</i> We
      must be getting home too. <i>Addio, mia bella casa.</i> But
      Georgie must be the first to know, Irene, do not speak of
      it until I have told him. Poor Georgie: I hope it will not
      be a terrible blow to him.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie came straight to Mallards on his arrival next
      morning from Folkestone with Cadman and Foljambe. His
      recall, he knew, meant that the highly dangerous Contessa
      had gone, and his admission by Grosvenor, after the door
      had been taken off the chain, that Lucia's influenza was
      officially over. He looked quite bronzed, and she gave him
      the warmest welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It all worked without a hitch,' she said as she told him
      of the plots and counter-plots which had woven so brilliant
      a tapestry of events. 'And it was that letter of Mrs
      Brocklebank's which you sent me that clapped the lid on
      Elizabeth. I saw at once what I could make of it. Really,
      Georgie, I turned it into a stroke of genius.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it was a stroke of genius already,' said Georgie. 'You
      only had to copy it out and send it to the Contessa.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was slightly ashamed of having taken the supreme
      credit for herself: the habit was hard to get rid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, all the credit shall be yours then,' she said
      handsomely. 'It was your stroke of genius. I copied it out
      very carelessly as if I had scribbled it off without
      thought. That was a nice touch, don't you think? The
      effect? Colossal, so Irene tells me, for I could not be
      there myself. That was only yesterday. A few desperate
      wriggles from Elizabeth, but of course no good. I do not
      suppose there was a more thoroughly thwarted woman in all
      Sussex than she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie gave a discreet little giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what's so terribly amusing is that she was right all
      the time about your influenza and your Italian and
      everything,' he said. 'Perfectly maddening for her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, she was malicious,' she observed, 'and that never
      pays.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Besides, it serves her right for spying on you,' Georgie
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, poor thing. But I shall begin now at once to be kind
      to her again. She shall come to lunch to-morrow, and you of
      course. By the way, Georgie, Irene takes so much interest
      in your painting. It was news to me, for her style is so
      different from your beautiful, careful work.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! That's news to me too,' said Georgie. 'She never
      seemed to see my sketches before: they might have been
      blank sheets of paper. Does she mean it? She's not pulling
      my leg?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing of the sort. And I couldn't help thinking it was a
      great opportunity for you to learn something about more
      modern methods. There is something you know in those fierce
      canvases of hers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish she had told me sooner,' said Georgie. 'We've only
      got a fortnight more here. I shall be very sorry when it's
      over, for I felt terribly pleased to be getting back to
      Tilling this morning. It'll be dull going back to
      Riseholme. Don't you feel that too? I'm sure you must. No
      plots: no competition.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had just received a telegram from Adele concerning
      the purchase of the Hurst, and it was no use putting off
      the staggering moment. She felt as if she was Zeus about to
      discharge a thunderbolt on some unhappy mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, I'm not going back to Riseholme at all,' she
      said. 'I have sold the Hurst: Adele Brixton has bought it.
      And, practically, I've bought that white house with the
      beautiful garden, which we admired so much, and that view
      over the marsh (how I thought of you at sunset yesterday),
      and really charming rooms with character.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sat open-mouthed, and all expression vanished from
      his face. It became as blank as a piece of sunburnt paper.
      Then slowly, as if he was coming round from an anaesthetic
      while the surgeon was still carving dexterously at living
      tissue, a look of intolerable anguish came into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But Foljambe, Cadman!' he cried. 'Foljambe can't come back
      here every night from Riseholme. What am I to do? Is it all
      irrevocable?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia bridled. She was quite aware that this parting (if
      there was to be one) between him and Foljambe would be a
      dagger; but it was surprising, to say the least, that the
      thought of the parting between herself and him should not
      have administered him the first shock. However, there it
      was. Foljambe first by all means.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I knew parting from Foljambe would be a great blow to
      you,' she said, with an acidity that Georgie could hardly
      fail to notice. 'What a pity that row you told me about
      came to nothing! But I am afraid that I can't promise to
      live in Riseholme for ever in order that you may not lose
      your parlourmaid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's not only that,' said Georgie, aware of this
      acidity and hastening to sweeten it. 'There's you as well.
      It will be ditchwater at Riseholme without you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, Georgie,' said Lucia. 'I wondered if and when,
      as the lawyers say, you would think of that. No reason why
      you should, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt that this was an unjust reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, after all, you settled to live in Tilling,' he
      retorted, 'and said nothing about how dull it would be
      without me. And I've got to do without Foljambe as well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had recourse to the lowest artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie-orgie, 'oo not cwoss with me?' she asked in an
      innocent, childish voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was not knocked out by this sentimental stroke
      below the belt. It was like Lucia to settle everything in
      exactly the way that suited her best, and then expect her
      poor pawns to be stricken at the thought of losing their
      queen. Besides, the loss of Foljambe <i>had</i> occurred to
      him first. Comfort, like charity, began at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'm not cross,' he said, utterly refusing to adopt
      baby-talk which implied surrender. 'But I've got every
      right to be hurt with you for settling to live in Tilling
      and not saying a word about how you would miss me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, I knew you would take that for granted,' began
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then why shouldn't you take it for granted about me?' he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ought to have,' she said. 'I confess it, so that's all
      right. But why don't you leave Riseholme too and settle
      here, Georgie? Foljambe, me, your career, now that Irene is
      so keen about your pictures, and this marvellous sense of
      not knowing what's going to happen next. Such stimulus,
      such stuff to keep the soul awake. And you don't want to go
      back to Riseholme: you said so yourself. You'd moulder and
      vegetate there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's different for you,' said Georgie. 'You've sold your
      house and I haven't sold mine. But there it is: I shall go
      back, I suppose, without Foljambe or you--I mean you or
      Foljambe. I wish I had never come here at all. It was that
      week when we went back for the fête, leaving Cadman and her
      here, which did all the mischief.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no use in saying anything more at present, and
      Georgie, feeling himself the victim of an imperious friend
      and of a faithless parlourmaid, went sadly back to Mallards
      Cottage. Lucia had settled to leave Riseholme without the
      least thought of what injury she inflicted on him by
      depriving him at one fell blow of Foljambe and her own
      companionship. He was almost sorry he had sent her that
      wonderful Brocklebank letter, for she had been in a very
      tight place, especially when Miss Mapp had actually seen
      her stripped and skipping in the garden as a cure for
      influenza; and had he not, by his stroke of genius, come to
      her rescue, her reputation here might have suffered an
      irretrievable eclipse, and they might all have gone back to
      Riseholme together. As it was, he had established her on
      the most exalted pinnacle and her thanks for that boon were
      expressed by dealing this beastly blow at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself down, in deep dejection, on the sofa in
      the little parlour of Mallards Cottage, in which he had
      been so comfortable. Life at Tilling had been full of
      congenial pleasures, and what a spice all these excitements
      had added to it! He had done a lot of painting, endless
      subjects still awaited his brush, and it had given him a
      thrill of delight to know that quaint Irene, with all her
      modern notions about art, thought highly of his work. Then
      there was the diversion of observing and nobly assisting in
      Lucia's campaign for the sovereignty, and her wars, as he
      knew, were far from won yet, for Tilling certainly had
      grown restive under her patronizings and acts of autocracy,
      and there was probably life in the old dog (meaning
      Elizabeth Mapp) yet. It was dreadful to think that he would
      not witness the campaign that was now being planned in
      those Napoleonic brains. These few weeks that remained to
      him here would be blackened by the thought of the wretched
      future that awaited him, and there would be no savour in
      them, for in so short a time now he would go back to
      Riseholme in a state of the most pitiable widowerhood,
      deprived of the ministering care of Foljambe, who all these
      years had made him so free from household anxieties, and of
      the companion who had spurred him on to ambitions and
      activities. Though he had lain awake shuddering at the
      thought that perhaps Lucia expected him to marry her, he
      felt he would almost sooner have done that than lose her
      altogether. 'It may be better to have loved and lost,'
      thought Georgie, 'than never to have loved at all, but it's
      very poor work not having loved and also to have lost' . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Foljambe singing in a high buzzing voice as she
      unpacked his luggage in his room upstairs, and though it
      was a rancid noise, how often had it filled him with the
      liveliest satisfaction, for Foljambe seldom sang, and when
      she did, it meant that she was delighted with her lot in
      life and was planning fresh efforts for his comfort. Now,
      no doubt, she was planning all sorts of pleasures for
      Cadman, and not thinking of him at all. Then there was
      Lucia: through his open window he could already hear the
      piano in the garden-room, and that showed a horrid
      callousness to his miserable plight. She didn't care; she
      was rolling on like the moon or the car of Juggernaut. It
      was heartless of her to occupy herself with those gay
      tinkling tunes, but the fact was that she was odiously
      selfish, and cared about nothing but her own successes . .
      . He abstracted himself from those painful reflections for
      a moment and listened more attentively. It was clearly
      Mozart that she was practising, but the melody was new to
      him. 'I bet,' thought Georgie, 'that this evening or
      tomorrow, she'll ask me to read over a new Mozart, and
      it'll be that very piece that she's practising now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His bitterness welled up within him again, as that pleasing
      reflection faded from his mind, and almost involuntarily he
      began to revolve how he could pay her back for her
      indifference to him. A dark but brilliant thought (like a
      black pearl) occurred to him. What if he dismissed his own
      chauffeur, Dickie, at present in the employment of his
      tenant at Riseholme, and, by a prospect of a rise in wages,
      seduced Cadman from Lucia's service, and took him and
      Foljambe back to Riseholme? He would put into practise the
      plan that Lucia herself had suggested, of establishing them
      in a cottage of their own, with a charwoman, so that
      Foljambe's days should be his, and her nights Cadman's.
      That would be a nasty one for Lucia, and the idea was
      feasible, for Cadman didn't think much of Tilling, and
      might easily fall in with it. But hardly had this devilish
      device occurred to him than his better nature rose in
      revolt against it. It would serve Lucia right, it is true,
      but it was unworthy of him. 'I should be descending to her
      level,' thought Georgie very nobly, 'if I did such a thing.
      Besides, how awful it would be if Cadman said no, and then
      told her that I had tempted him. She would despise me for
      doing it, as much as I despise her, and she would gloat
      over me for having failed. It won't do. I must be more
      manly about it all somehow. I must be like Major Benjy and
      say "Damn the woman! Faugh!" and have a drink. But I feel
      sick at the idea of going back to Riseholme alone . . . I
      wish I had eyebrows like a paste-brush, and could say damn
      properly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With a view to being more manly he poured himself out a
      very small whisky and soda, and his eye fell on a few
      letters lying for him on the table, which must have come
      that morning. There was one with the Riseholme postmark,
      and the envelope was of that very bright blue which he
      always used. His own stationery evidently, of which he had
      left a supply, without charge, for the use of his tenant.
      He opened it, and behold there was dawn breaking on his
      dark life, for Colonel Cresswell wanted to know if he had
      any thoughts of selling his house. He was much taken by
      Riseholme, his sister had bought the Hurst, and he would
      like to be near her. Would Georgie therefore let him have a
      line about this as soon as possible, for there was another
      house, Mrs Quantock's, about which he would enter into
      negotiations, if there was no chance of getting Georgie's .
      . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The revulsion of feeling was almost painful. Georgie had
      another whisky and soda at once, not because he was
      depressed, but because he was so happy. 'But I mustn't make
      a habit of it,' he thought, as he seized his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's first impulse when he had written his letter to
      Colonel Cresswell was to fly round to Mallards with this
      wonderful news, but now he hesitated. Some hitch might
      arise, the price Colonel Cresswell proposed might not come
      up to his expectations, though--God knew--he would not
      dream of haggling over any reasonable offer. Lucia would
      rejoice at the chance of his staying in Tilling but she did
      not deserve to have such a treat of pleasurable expectation
      for the present. Besides, though he had been manly enough
      to reject with scorn the wiles of the devil who had
      suggested the seduction of Cadman, he thought he would
      tease her a little even if his dream came true. He had
      often told her that if he was rich enough he would have a
      flat in London, and now, if this sale of his house came
      off, he would pretend that he was not meaning to live in
      Tilling at all, but would live in town, and he would see
      how she would take that. It would be her turn to be hurt,
      and serve her right. So instead of interrupting the
      roulades of Mozart that were pouring from the window of the
      garden-room, he walked briskly down to the High Street to
      see how Tilling was taking the news that it would have
      Lucia always with it, if her purchase of Grebe had become
      public property. If not, he would have the pleasure of
      disseminating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hint of seafaring about Georgie's costume as
      befitted one who had lately spent so much time on the pier
      at Folkestone. He had a very nautical-looking cap, with a
      black shining brim, a dark-blue double-breasted coat, white
      trousers and smart canvas shoes: really he might have been
      supposed to have come up to Tilling in his yacht, and have
      landed to see the town . . . A piercing whistle from the
      other side of the street showed him that his appearance had
      at once attracted attention, and there was Irene planted
      with her easel in the middle of the pavement, and painting
      a row of flayed carcasses that hung in the butcher's shop.
      Rembrandt had better look out . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'Avast there, Georgie,' she cried. 'Home is the sailor,
      home from sea. Come and talk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather more attention than Georgie had
      anticipated, but as Irene was quite capable of shouting
      nautical remarks after him if he pretended not to hear, he
      tripped across the street to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you seen Lucia, Commodore?' she said. 'And has she
      told you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About her buying Grebe?' asked Georgie. 'Oh, yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's all right then. She told me not to mention it till
      she'd seen you. Mapp's popping in and out of the shops, and
      I simply must be the first to tell her. Don't cut in in
      front of me, will you? Oh, by the way, have you done any
      sketching at Folkestone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One or two,' said Georgie. 'Nothing very much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense. Do let me come and see them. I love your
      handling. Just cast your eye over this and tell me what's
      wrong with--There she is. Hi! Mapp!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, like Georgie, apparently thought it more prudent
      to answer that summons and avoid further public
      proclamation of her name, and came hurrying across the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Irene mine,' she said. 'What a beautiful
      picture! All the poor skinned piggies in a row, or are they
      sheep? Back again, Mr Georgie? How we've missed you. And
      how do you think dear Lulu is looking after her illness?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mapp, there's news for you,' said Irene, remembering the
      luncheon-party yesterday. 'You must guess: I shall tease
      you. It's about your Lulu. Three guesses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a relapse, I hope?' said Elizabeth brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite wrong. Something much nicer. You'll enjoy it
      tremendously.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Another of those beautiful musical parties?' asked
      Elizabeth. 'Or has she skipped a hundred times before
      breakfast?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, much nicer,' said Irene. 'Heavenly for us all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of apprehension had come over Elizabeth's face, as
      an awful idea occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear one, give over teasing,' she said. 'Tell me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's not going away at the end of the month,' said Irene.
      'She's bought Grebe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Blank dismay spread over Elizabeth's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, what a joy!' she said. 'Lovely news.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried off to Wasters, too much upset even to make
      Diva, who was coming out of Twistevant's, a partner in her
      joy. Only this morning she had been consulting her calendar
      and observing that there were only fifteen days more before
      Tilling was quit of Lulu, and now at a moderate estimate
      there might be at least fifteen years of her. Then she
      found she could not bear the weight of her joy alone and
      sped back after Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva dear, come in for a minute,' she said. 'I've heard
      something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva looked with concern at that lined and agitated face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter?' she said. 'Nothing serious?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh no, lovely news,' she said with bitter sarcasm.
      'Tilling will rejoice. <i>She's</i> not going away.
      <i>She's</i> going to stop here for ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to ask who 'she' was. For weeks Lucia had
      been 'she'. If you meant Susan Wyse, or Diva or Irene, you
      said so. But 'she' was Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suspected as much,' said Diva. 'I know she had an order
      to view Grebe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, in a spasm of exasperation, banged the door of
      Wasters so violently after she and Diva had entered, that
      the house shook and a note leaped from the wire letter-box
      on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Steady on with my front door,' said Diva, 'or there'll be
      some dilapidations to settle.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth took no notice of this petty remark, and picked
      up the note. The handwriting was unmistakable, for Lucia's
      study of Homer had caused her (subconsciously or not) to
      adopt a modified form of Greek script, and she made her 'a'
      like alpha and her 'e' like epsilon. At the sight of it
      Elizabeth suffered a complete loss of self-control, she
      held the note on high as if exposing a relic to the gaze of
      pious worshippers, and made a low curtsey to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And this is from Her,' she said. 'Oh, how kind of Her
      Majesty to write to me in her own hand with all those
      ridiculous twiddles. Not content with speaking Italian
      quite perfectly, she must also write in Greek. I dare say
      she talks it beautifully too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, pull yourself together, Elizabeth,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not aware that I am coming to bits, dear,' said
      Elizabeth, opening the note with the very tips of her
      fingers, as if it had been written by someone infected with
      plague or at least influenza. 'But let me see what Her
      Majesty says . . . "Dearest Liblib" . . . the impertinence
      of it! Or is it Riseholme humour?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you call her Lulu,' said Diva. 'Do get on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth frowned with the difficulty of deciphering this
      crabbed handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Now that I am quite free of infection,"' she
      read--(Infection indeed. She never had flu at all)--'"of
      infection, I can receive my friends again, and hope so much
      you will lunch with me to-morrow. I hasten also to tell you
      of my change of plans, for I have so fallen in love with
      your delicious Tilling that I have bought a house
      here--(Stale news!)--and shall settle into it next month.
      An awful wrench, as you may imagine, to leave my dear
      Riseholme--(Then why wrench yourself?)--. . . and poor
      Georgie is in despair, but Tilling and all you dear people
      have wrapt yourselves round my heart. (Have we? The same to
      you!)--and it is no use my struggling to get free. I wonder
      therefore if you would consider letting me take your
      beautiful Mallards at the same rent for another month,
      while Grebe is being done up, and my furniture being
      installed? I should be so grateful if this is possible,
      otherwise I shall try to get Mallards Cottage when my
      Georgie--(My!)--goes back to Riseholme. Could you, do you
      think, let me know about this to-morrow, if, as I hope, you
      will send me <i>un amabile 'si'</i>--(What in the world is
      an <i>amabile si?)</i>--and come to lunch? <i>Tanti
      saluti,</i> Lucia."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understand,' said Diva. 'It means "an amiable yes",
      about going to lunch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, Diva. You are quite an Italian scholar too,'
      said Elizabeth. 'I call that a thoroughly heartless letter.
      And all of us, mark you, must serve her convenience. I
      can't get back into Mallards, because She wants it, and
      even if I refused, She would be next door at Mallards
      Cottage. I've never been so long out of my own house
      before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Both ladies felt that it would be impossible to keep up any
      semblance of indignation that Lucia was wanting to take
      Mallards for another month, for it suited them both so
      marvellously well.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are in luck,' said Diva, 'getting another month's let
      at that price. So am I too, if you want to stop here, for
      Irene is certain to let me stay on at her house, because
      her cottage is next to Grebe and she'll be in and out all
      day--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor Irene seems to be under a sort of spell,' said
      Elizabeth in parenthesis. 'She can think about nothing
      except that woman. Her painting has fallen off terribly.
      Coarsened . . . Yes, dear, I think I will give the Queen of
      the Italian language an <i>amabile si</i> about Mallards. I
      don't know if you would consider taking rather a smaller
      rent for November. Winter prices are always lower.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not,' said Diva. 'You're going to get the same
      as before for Mallards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's my affair, dear,' said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And this is mine,' said Diva firmly. 'And will you go to
      lunch with her to-morrow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, now comparatively calm, sank down in the
      window-seat, which commanded so good a view of the High
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose I shall have to,' she said. 'One must be civil,
      whatever has happened. Oh, there's Major Benjy. I wonder if
      he's heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped at the window and threw it open. He came
      hurrying across the street and began to speak in a loud
      voice before she could get in a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That amusing guessing game of yours, Miss Elizabeth,' he
      said, just like Irene. 'About Mrs Lucas. I'll give you
      three--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One's enough: we all know,' said Elizabeth. 'Joyful news,
      isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed, it is delightful to know that we are not going to
      lose one who--who has endeared herself to us all so much,'
      said he very handsomely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. His tone lacked sincerity; there seemed to be
      something in his mind which he left unsaid. Elizabeth gave
      him a piercing and confidential look.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Major Benjy?' she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced round like a conspirator to see there was no one
      eavesdropping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those parties, you know,' he said. 'Those entertainments
      which we've all enjoyed so much. Beautiful music. But
      Grebe's a long way off on a wet winter night. Not just
      round the corner. Now if she was settling in Mallards--'
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw at once what an appalling interpretation might be
      put on this, and went on in a great hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll have to come to our rescue, Miss Elizabeth,' he
      said, dropping his voice so that even Diva could not hear.
      'When you're back in your own house again, you'll have to
      look after us all as you always used to. Charming woman,
      Mrs Lucas, and most hospitable, I'm sure, but in the
      winter, as I was saying, that long way out of Tilling, just
      to hear a bit of music, and have a tomato, if you see what
      I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, of course I see what you mean,' murmured Elizabeth.
      'The dear thing, as you say, is so hospitable. Lovely music
      and tomatoes, but we must make a stand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you can have too much of a good thing,' said Major
      Benjy, 'and for my part a little Mozart lasts me a long
      time, especially if it's a long way on a wet night. Then
      I'm told there's an idea of callisthenic classes, though no
      doubt they would be for ladies only--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't be too sure about that,' said Elizabeth. 'Our
      dear friend has got enough--shall we call it
      self-confidence?--to think herself capable of teaching
      anybody anything. If you aren't careful, Major Benjy,
      you'll find yourself in a skipping-match on the lawn at
      Grebe, before you know what you're doing. You've been King
      Cophetua already, which I, for one, never thought to see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was just once in a way,' said he. 'But when it comes
      to callisthenic classes--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva, in an agony at not being able to hear what was going
      on, had crept up behind Elizabeth, and now crouched close
      to her as she stood leaning out of the window. At this
      moment, Lucia, having finished her piano-practice, came
      round the corner from Mallards into the High Street.
      Elizabeth hastily withdrew from the window and bumped into
      Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So sorry: didn't know you were there, dear,' she said. 'We
      must put our heads together another time, Major Benjy. Au
      reservoir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, do tell me what you're going to put your heads
      together about,' said Diva. 'I only heard just the end.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was important to get allies: otherwise Elizabeth would
      have made a few well-chosen remarks about eavesdroppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is sad to find that just when Lucia has settled never
      to leave us any more,' she said, 'that there should be so
      much feeling in Tilling about being told to do this and
      being made to listen to that. Major Benjy--I don't know if
      you heard that part, dear--spoke very firmly, and I thought
      sensibly about it. The question really is if England is a
      free country or not, and whether we're going to be trampled
      upon. We've been very happy in Tilling all these years,
      going our own way, and living in sweet harmony together,
      and I for one, and Major Benjy for another, don't intend to
      put our necks under the yoke. I don't know how you feel
      about it. Perhaps you like it, for after all you were Mary
      Queen of Scots just as much as Major Benjy was King
      Cophetua.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't go to any po-di-mus, after dinner at Grebe,' said
      Diva. 'I shouldn't have gone to the last, but you persuaded
      us all to go. Where was your neck then, Elizabeth? Be
      fair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be fair yourself, Diva,' said Elizabeth with some heat.
      'You know perfectly well that I wanted you to go in order
      that you might all get your necks from under her yoke, and
      hear that she couldn't speak a word of Italian.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And a nice mess you made of that,' said Diva. 'But never
      mind. She's established now as a perfect Italian linguist,
      and there it is. Don't meddle with that again, or you'll
      only prove that she can talk Greek too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth rose and pointed at her like one of Raphael's
      Sibyls.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva, to this day I don't believe she can talk Italian. It
      was a conjuring trick, and I'm no conjurer but a plain
      woman, and I can't tell you how it was done. But I will
      swear it was a trick. Besides, answer me this! Why doesn't
      she offer to give us Italian lessons if she knows it? She
      has offered to teach us bridge and Homer and callisthenics
      and take choir-practices and arranged tableaux. Why not
      Italian?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's curious,' said Diva thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not the least curious. The reason is obvious. Everyone
      snubbed me and scolded me, you among others, at that
      dreadful luncheon-party, but I know I'm right, and some day
      the truth will come out. I can wait. Meantime what she
      means to do is to take us all in hand, and I won't be taken
      in hand. What is needed from us all is a little firmness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva went home thrilled to the marrow of her bones at the
      thought of the rich entertainment that these next months
      promised to provide. Naturally she saw through Elizabeth's
      rodomontade about yokes and free countries: what she meant
      was that she intended to assert herself again, and topple
      Lucia over. Two could not reign in Tilling, as everybody
      could see by this time. 'All most interesting,' said Diva
      to herself. 'Elizabeth's got hold of Major Benjy for the
      present, and Lucia's going to lose Georgie, but then men
      don't count for much in Tilling: it's brains that do it.
      There'll be more bridge-parties and teas this winter than
      ever before. Really, I don't know which of them I would
      back. Hullo, there's a note from her. Lunch to-morrow, I
      expect . . . I thought so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's luncheon-party next day was to be of the nature of
      a banquet to celebrate the double event of her recovery and
      of the fact that Tilling, instead of mourning her
      approaching departure, was privileged to retain her, as
      Elizabeth had said, for ever and ever. The whole circle of
      her joyful friends would be there, and she meant to give
      them to eat of the famous dish of lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme,</i> which she had provided for Georgie, a few
      weeks ago, to act as a buffer to break the shock of
      Foljambe's engagement. It had already produced a great deal
      of wild surmise in the minds of the housewives at Tilling
      for no one could conjecture how it was made, and Lucia had
      been deaf to all requests for the recipe: Elizabeth had
      asked her twice to give it her, but Lucia had merely
      changed the subject without attempt at transition: she had
      merely talked about something quite different. This
      secretiveness was considered unamiable, for the use of
      Tilling was to impart its culinary mysteries to friends, so
      that they might enjoy their favourite dishes at each
      other's houses, and lobster <i>à la Riseholme</i> had long
      been an agonizing problem to Elizabeth. She had made an
      attempt at it herself, but the result was not encouraging.
      She had told Diva and the Padre that she felt sure she had
      'guessed it', and, when bidden to come to lunch and partake
      of it, they had both anticipated a great treat. But
      Elizabeth had clearly guessed wrong, for lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme à la Mapp</i> had been found to consist of
      something resembling lumps of india-rubber (so tough that
      the teeth positively bounced away from them on contact)
      swimming in a dubious pink gruel, and both of them left a
      great deal on their plates, concealed as far as possible
      under their knives and forks, though their hostess
      continued manfully to chew, till her jaw-muscles gave out.
      Then Elizabeth had had recourse to underhand methods. Lucia
      had observed her more than once in the High Street, making
      herself suspiciously pleasant to her cook, and from the
      window of the garden-room just before her influenza, she
      had seen her at the back door of Mallards again in
      conversation with the lady of the kitchen. On this
      occasion, with an unerring conviction in her mind, she had
      sent for her cook and asked her what Miss Mapp wanted. It
      was even so: Elizabeth's ostensible inquiry was for an
      egg-whisk, which she had left by mistake at Mallards three
      months ago, but then she had unmasked her batteries, and,
      actually fingering a bright half-crown, had asked
      point-blank for the recipe of this lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme.</i> The cook had given her a polite but firm
      refusal, and Lucia was now more determined than ever that
      Elizabeth should never know the exquisite secret. She
      naturally felt that it was beneath her to take the
      slightest notice of this low and paltry attempt to obtain
      by naked bribery a piece of private knowledge, and she
      never let Elizabeth know that she was cognizant of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the morning before Lucia's luncheon-party a telegram
      had come for Georgie from Colonel Cresswell making a firm
      and very satisfactory offer for his house at Riseholme,
      unfurnished. That had made him really busy: first he had to
      see Foljambe and tell her (under seal of secrecy, for he
      had his little plot of teasing Lucia in mind) that he was
      proposing to settle in Tilling. Foljambe was very pleased
      to hear it, and in a burst of most unusual feeling, had
      said that it would have gone to her heart to leave his
      service, after so many harmonious years, when he went back
      to Riseholme, and that she was very glad to adopt the plan,
      which she had agreed to, when it was supposed that they
      would all go back to Riseholme together. She would do her
      work all day in Georgie's house, and retire in the evening
      to the connubialities of the garage at Grebe. When this
      affecting interview was over, she went back to her jobs,
      and again Georgie heard her singing as she cleaned the
      silver. 'So that's beautiful,' he said to himself, 'and the
      cloud has passed for ever. Now I must instantly see about
      getting a house here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out. There was still an hour before he was due
      at the lobster lunch. Though he had left the seaside
      twenty-four hours ago, he put on his yachtsman's cap and,
      walking on air, set off for the house-agents'. Of all the
      houses in the place which he had seen, he was sure that
      none would suit him as well as this dear little Mallards
      Cottage which he now occupied; he liked it, Foljambe liked
      it, they all liked it, but he had no idea whether he could
      get a lease from kippered Isabel. As he crossed the High
      Street, a wild hoot from a motor-horn just behind him gave
      him a dreadful fright, but he jumped nimbly for the
      pavement, reached it unhurt, and though his cap fell off
      and landed in a puddle, he was only thankful to have
      escaped being run down by Isabel Poppit on her motor-cycle.
      Her hair was like a twisted mop, her skin incredibly
      tanned, and mounted on her cycle she looked like a sort of
      modernized Valkyrie in rather bad repair . . . Meeting her
      just at this moment, when he was on his way to inquire
      about Mallards Cottage, seemed a good omen to Georgie, and
      he picked up his cap and ran back across the street, for in
      her natural anxiety to avoid killing him she had swerved
      into a baker's cart, and had got messed up in the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do apologize, Miss Poppit,' he said. 'Entirely my fault
      for not looking both ways before I crossed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No harm done,' said she. 'Oh, your beautiful cap. I am
      sorry. But after all the wonderful emptiness and silence
      among the sand-dunes, a place like a town seems to me a
      positive nightmare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, the emptiness and silence does seem to suit you,'
      said Georgie, gazing in astonishment at her mahogany face.
      'I never saw anybody looking so well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel, with a tug of her powerful arms, disentangled her
      cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the simple life,' said she, shaking her hair out of
      her eyes. 'Never again will I live in a town. I have taken
      the bungalow I am in now for six months more, and I only
      came in to Tilling to tell the house-agent to get another
      tenant for Mallards Cottage, as I understand that you're
      going back to Riseholme at the end of this month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had never felt more firmly convinced that a wise
      and beneficent Providence looked after him with the most
      amiable care.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I was also on my way to the house-agents',' he said,
      'to see if I could get a lease of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gracious! What a good thing I didn't run over you just
      now,' said Isabel, with all the simplicity derived from the
      emptiness and silence of sand-dunes. 'Come on to the
      agents'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Within half an hour the whole business was as good as
      settled. Isabel held a lease from her mother of Mallards
      Cottage, which had five years yet to run, and she agreed to
      transfer this to Georgie, and store her furniture. He had
      just time to change into his new mustard-coloured suit with
      its orange tie and its topaz tie-pin, and arrived at the
      luncheon-party in the very highest spirits. Besides, there
      was his talk with Lucia when other guests had gone, to look
      forward to. How he would tease her about settling in
      London!
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Tilling regarded the joyful prospect of Lucia's
      never going away again with certain reservations, and, in
      the case of Elizabeth, with nothing but reservations, her
      guests vied with each other in the fervency of their
      self-congratulations, and Elizabeth outdid them all, as she
      took into her mouth small fragments of lobster, in the
      manner of a wine-taster, appraising subtle flavours. There
      was cheese, there were shrimps, there was cream: there were
      so many things that she felt like Adam giving names to the
      innumerable procession of different animals. She had helped
      herself so largely that when the dish came to Georgie there
      was nothing left but a little pink juice, but he hardly
      minded at all, so happy had the events of the morning made
      him. Then when Elizabeth felt that she would choke if she
      said anything more in praise of Lucia, Mr Wyse took it up,
      and Georgie broke in and said it was cruel of them all to
      talk about the delicious busy winter they would have, when
      they all knew that he would not be here any longer but back
      at Riseholme. In fact, he rather overdid his lamentations,
      and Lucia, whose acute mind detected the grossest
      insincerity in Elizabeth's raptures, began to wonder
      whether Georgie for some unknown reason was quite as woeful
      as he professed to be. Never had he looked more radiant,
      not a shadow of disappointment had come over his face when
      he inspected the casserole that had once contained his
      favourite dish, and found nothing left for him. There was
      something up--what on earth could it be? Had Foljambe
      jilted Cadman?--and just as Elizabeth was detecting
      flavours in the mysterious dish, so Lucia was trying to
      arrive at an analysis of the gay glad tones in which
      Georgie expressed his misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's too tarsome of you all to go on about the lovely
      things you're going to do,' he said. 'Callisthenic classes
      and Homer and bridge, and poor me far away, I shall tell
      myself every morning that I hate Tilling; I shall say like
      Coué, "Day by day in every way, I dislike it more and
      more," until I've convinced myself that I shall be glad to
      go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse made him a beautiful bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We too shall miss you very sadly, Mr Pillson,' he said,
      'and for my part I shall be tempted to hate Riseholme for
      taking from us one who has so endeared himself to us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ask to be allowed to associate myself with those
      sentiments,' said Major Benjy, whose contempt for Georgie
      and his sketches and his needlework had been intensified by
      the sight of his yachting cap, which he had pronounced to
      be only fit for a popinjay. It had been best to keep on
      good terms with him while Lucia was at Mallards, for he
      might poison her mind about himself, and now that he was
      going, there was no harm in these handsome remarks. Then
      the Padre said something Scotch and sympathetic and
      regretful, and Georgie found himself, slightly to his
      embarrassment, making bows and saying 'thank you' right and
      left in acknowledgment of these universal expressions of
      regret that he was so soon about to leave them. It was
      rather awkward, for within a few hours they would all know
      that he had taken Mallards Cottage unfurnished for five
      years, which did not look like an immediate departure. But
      this little deception was necessary if he was to bring off
      his joke against Lucia, and make her think that he meant to
      settle in London. And after all, since everybody seemed so
      sorry that (as they imagined) he was soon to leave Tilling,
      they ought to be very much pleased to find that he was
      doing nothing of the kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests dispersed soon after lunch and Georgie, full of
      mischief and naughtiness, lingered with his hostess in the
      garden-room. All her gimlet glances during lunch had failed
      to fathom his high good humour: here was he on the eve of
      parting with his Foljambe and herself, and yet his face
      beamed with content. Lucia was in very good spirits also,
      for she had seen Elizabeth's brow grow more and more
      furrowed as she strove to find a formula for the lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a lovely luncheon-party, although I got no lobster at
      all,' said Georgie, as he settled himself for his teasing.
      'I did enjoy it. And Elizabeth's rapture at your stopping
      here! She must have an awful blister on her tongue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sapphira must look to her laurels, poor thing,' she
      observed pensively. 'And how sorry they all were that you
      are going away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wasn't it nice of them?' said Georgie. 'But never mind
      that now: I've got something wonderful to tell you. I've
      never felt happier in my life, for the thing I've wanted
      for so many years can be managed at last. You will be
      pleased for my sake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laid a sympathetic hand on his. She felt that she had
      shown too little sympathy with one who was to lose his
      parlourmaid and his oldest friend so soon. But the gaiety
      with which he bore his double stroke was puzzling . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie,' she said, 'anything that makes you happy
      makes me happy. I am rejoiced that something of the sort
      has occurred. Really rejoiced. Tell me what it is
      instantly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie drew a long breath. He wanted to give it out all in
      a burst of triumph like a fanfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too lovely,' he said. 'Colonel Cresswell has bought my
      house at Riseholme--such a good price--and now at last I
      shall be able to settle in London. I was just as tired of
      Riseholme as you, and now I shall never see it again or
      Tilling either. Isn't it a dream? Riseholme, stuffy little
      Mallards Cottage, all things of the past! I shall have a
      nice little home in London, and you must promise to come up
      and stay with me sometimes. How I looked forward to telling
      you! Orchestral concerts at Queen's Hall, instead of our
      fumbling little arrangements of Mozartino for four hands.
      Pictures, a club if I can afford it, and how nice to think
      of you so happy down at Tilling! As for all the fuss I made
      yesterday about losing Foljambe, I can't think why it
      seemed to me so terrible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him one more gimlet glance, and found she did
      not believe a single word he was saying except as regards
      the sale of his house at Riseholme. All the rest must be
      lies, for the Foljambe-wound could not possibly have healed
      so soon. But she instantly made up her mind to pretend to
      believe him, and clapped her hands for pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie! What splendid news!' she said. 'I am
      pleased. I've always felt that you, with all your keenness
      and multifarious interests in life, were throwing your life
      away in these little backwaters like Riseholme and Tilling.
      London is the only place for you! Now, tell me: Are you
      going to get a flat or a house? And where is it to be? If I
      were you I should have a house!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not quite what Georgie had expected. He had
      thought that Lucia would suggest that now that he was quit
      of Riseholme he positively must come to Tilling, but not
      only did she fail to do that, but she seemed delighted that
      no such thought had entered into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't really thought about that yet,' he said.
      'There's something to be said for a flat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No doubt. It's more compact, and then there's no bother
      about rates and taxes. And you'll have your car, I suppose.
      And will your cook go with you? What does she say to it
      all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't told her yet,' said Georgie, beginning to get a
      little pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really? I should have thought you would have done that at
      once. And isn't Foljambe pleased that you are so happy
      again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She doesn't know yet,' said Georgie. 'I thought I would
      tell you first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie, how sweet of you,' said Lucia. 'I'm sure
      Foljambe will be as pleased as I am. You'll be going up to
      London, I suppose, constantly now till the end of this
      month, so that you can get your house or your flat,
      whichever it is, ready as soon as possible. How busy you
      and I will be, you settling into London and I into Tilling.
      Do you know, supposing you had thought of living
      permanently here, now that you've got rid of your house at
      Riseholme, I should have done my best to persuade you not
      to, though I know in my selfishness that I did suggest that
      yesterday. But it would never do, Georgie. It's all very
      well for elderly women like me, who just want a little
      peace and quietness, or for retired men like Major Benjy or
      for dilettantes like Mr Wyse, but for you, a thousand times
      no. I am sure of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie got thoughtfuller and thoughtfuller. It had been
      rather a mistake to try to tease Lucia, for so far from
      being teased she was simply pleased. The longer she went on
      like this, and there seemed no end to her expressions of
      approval, the harder it would be to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you really think that?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Indeed I do. You would soon be terribly bored with
      Tilling. Oh, Georgie, I am so pleased with your good
      fortune and your good sense. I wonder if the agents here
      have got any houses or flats in London on their books.
      Let's go down there at once and see. We might find
      something. I'll run and put on my hat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie threw in his hand. As usual Lucia had come out on
      top.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're too tarsome,' he said. 'You don't believe a single
      word I've been telling you of my plans.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, of course I don't,' said Lucia brightly. 'I never
      heard such a pack of rubbish. Ananias is not in it. But it
      is true about selling your Riseholme house, I hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that part is,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then of course you're going to live here,' said she. 'I
      meant you to do that all along. Now how about Mallards
      Cottage? I saw that Yahoo in the High Street this morning,
      and she told me she wanted to let it for the winter. Let's
      go down to the agents' as I suggested, and see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've done that already,' said Georgie, 'for I met her too,
      and she nearly knocked me down. I've got a five years'
      lease of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Lucia's nature to crow over anybody. She
      proved her quality and passed on to something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfect!' she said. 'It has all come out just as I
      planned, so that's all right. Now, if you've got nothing to
      do, let us have some music.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She got out the new Mozart which she had been practising.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This looks a lovely duet,' she said, 'and we haven't tried
      it yet. I shall be terribly rusty, for all the time I had
      influenza, I hardly dared to play the piano at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie looked at the new Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does look nice,' he said. 'Tum-ti-tum. Why, that's the
      one I heard you practising so busily yesterday morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia took not the slightest notice of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We begin together,' she said, 'on the third beat. Now . .
      . <i>Uno, due, TRE!'</i>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The painting and decorating of Grebe began at once. Irene
      offered to do all the painting with her own hands, and
      recommended as a scheme for the music-room, a black ceiling
      and four walls of different colours, vermilion, emerald
      green, ultramarine and yellow. It would take a couple of
      months or so to execute, and the cost would be considerable
      as lapis lazuli must certainly be used for the ultramarine
      wall, but she assured Lucia that the result would be unique
      and marvellously stimulating to the eye, especially if she
      would add a magenta carpet and a nickel-plated mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It sounds too lovely, dear,' said Lucia, contemplating the
      sample of colours which Irene submitted to her, 'but I feel
      sure I shan't be able to afford it. Such a pity! Those
      beautiful hues!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Irene besought her to introduce a little variety into
      the shape of the windows. It would be amusing to have one
      window egg-shaped, and another triangular, and another with
      five or six or seven irregular sides, so that it looked as
      if it was a hole in the wall made by a shell. Or how about
      a front door that, instead of opening sideways, let down
      like a portcullis?
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene rose to more daring conceptions yet. One night she
      had dined on a pot of strawberry jam and half a pint of
      very potent cocktails, because she wanted her eye for
      colour to be at its keenest round about eleven o'clock when
      the moon would rise over the marsh, and she hoped to put
      the lid for ever on Whistler's naïve old-fashioned attempts
      to paint moonlight. After this salubrious meal she had come
      round to Mallards, waiting for the moon to rise and sat for
      half an hour at Lucia's piano, striking random chords, and
      asking Lucia what colour they were. These musical rainbows
      suggested a wonderful idea, and she shut down the piano
      with a splendid purple bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Darling, I've got a new scheme for Grebe,' she said. 'I
      want you to furnish a room sideways, if you understand what
      I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I do,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, like this,' said Irene very thoughtfully. 'You would
      open the door of the room and find you were walking about
      on wallpaper with pictures hanging on it. (I'll do the
      pictures for you.) Then one side of the room where the
      window is would be whitewashed as if it was a ceiling and
      the window would be the skylight. The opposite side would
      be the floor; and you would have the furniture screwed on
      to it. The other walls, including the one which would be
      the ceiling in an ordinary room, would be covered with
      wallpaper and more pictures and a book-case. It would all
      be sideways, you see: you'd enter through the wall, and the
      room would be at right angles to you; ceiling on the left,
      floor on the right, or vice versa. It would give you a
      perfectly new perception of the world. You would see
      everything from a new angle, which is what we want so much
      in life nowadays. Don't you think so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene's speech was distinct and clear cut, she walked up
      and down the garden-room with a firm unwavering step, and
      Lucia put from her the uneasy suspicion that her dinner had
      gone to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be most delightful,' she said, 'but slightly too
      experimental for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then, you see,' continued Irene, 'how useful it would
      be if somebody tipsy came in. It would make him sober at
      once, for tipsy people see everything crooked, and so your
      sideways-room, being crooked, would appear to him straight,
      and so he would be himself again. Just like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That would be splendid,' said Lucia, 'but I can't provide
      a room where tipsy people could feel sober again. The house
      isn't big enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene sat down by her, and passionately clasped one of her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucia, you're too adorable,' she said. 'Nothing defeats
      you. I've been talking the most abject nonsense, though I
      do think that there may be something in it, and you remain
      as calm as the moon which I hope will rise over the marsh
      before long, unless the almanack in which I looked it out
      is last year's. Don't tell anybody else about the
      sideways-room, will you, or they might think I was drunk.
      Let it be our secret, darling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia wondered for a moment if she ought to allow Irene to
      spend the night on the marsh, but she was perfectly capable
      of coherent speech and controlled movements, and possibly
      the open air might do her good.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a soul shall know, dear,' she said. 'And now if you're
      really going to paint the moon, you had better start. You
      feel quite sure you can manage it, don't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I can manage the moon,' said Irene stoutly.
      'I've managed it lots of times. I wish you would come with
      me. I always hate leaving you. Or shall I stop here, and
      paint you instead? Or do you think Georgie would come? What
      a lamb, isn't he? Pass the mint-sauce please, or shall I go
      home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps that would be best,' said Lucia. 'Paint the moon
      another night.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia next day hurried up the firm to which she had
      entrusted the decoration of Grebe, in case Irene had some
      new schemes, and half-way through November, the house was
      ready to receive her furniture from Riseholme. Georgie
      simultaneously was settling into Mallards Cottage, and in
      the course of it went through a crisis of the most
      agitating kind. Isabel had assured him that by noon on a
      certain day men would arrive to take her furniture to the
      repository where it was to be stored, and as the vans with
      his effects from Riseholme had arrived in Tilling the night
      before, he induced the foreman to begin moving everything
      out of the house at nine next morning and bring his
      furniture in. This was done, and by noon all Isabel's
      tables and chairs and beds and crockery were standing out
      in the street ready for her van. They completely blocked it
      for wheeled traffic, though pedestrians could manage to
      squeeze by in single file. Tilling did not mind this little
      inconvenience in the least, for it was all so interesting,
      and tradesmen's carts coming down the street were
      cheerfully backed into the churchyard again and turned
      round in order to make a more circuitous route, and those
      coming up were equally obliging, while foot-passengers,
      thrilled with having the entire contents of a house exposed
      for their inspection, were unable to tear themselves away
      from so intimate an exhibition. Then Georgie's furniture
      was moved in, and there were dazzling and fascinating
      objects for inspection, pictures that he had painted,
      screens and bedspreads that he had worked, very pretty
      woollen pyjamas for the winter and embroidered covers for
      hot-water bottles. These millineries roused Major Benjy's
      manliest indignation, and he was nearly late for the tram
      to take him out to play golf, for he could not tear himself
      away from the revolting sight. In a few hours Georgie's
      effects had passed into the house, but still there was no
      sign of anyone coming to remove Isabel's from the street,
      and, by dint of telephoning, it was discovered that she had
      forgotten to give any order at all about them, and the men
      from the repository were out on other jobs. It then began
      to rain rather heavily, and though Georgie called heaven
      and earth to witness that all this muddle was not his fault
      he felt compelled, out of mere human compassion, to have
      Isabel's furniture moved back into his house again. In
      consequence the rooms and passages on the ground floor were
      completely blocked with stacks of cupboards and tables
      piled high with books and crockery and saucepans, the front
      door would not shut, and Foljambe, caught upstairs by the
      rising tide, could not come down. The climax of intensity
      arrived when she let down a string from an upper window,
      and Georgie's cook attached a small basket of nourishing
      food to it. Diva was terribly late for lunch at the Wyses,
      for she was rooted to the spot, though it was raining
      heavily, till she was sure that Foljambe would not be
      starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the time that the month of November was over, the
      houses of the new-comers were ready to receive them, and a
      general post of owners back to their homes took place after
      a remunerative let of four months. Elizabeth returned to
      Mallards from Wasters, bringing with her, in addition to
      what she had taken there, a cargo of preserves made from
      Diva's garden of such bulk that Coplen had to make two
      journeys with her large wheelbarrow. Diva returned to
      Wasters from Taormina, quaint Irene came back to Taormina
      from the labourer's cottage with a handcart laden with
      striking canvases including that of the women wrestlers who
      had become men, and the labourer and his family were free
      to trek to their own abode from the hop-picker's shanty
      which they had inhabited so much longer than they had
      intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed several extremely busy days for most of the
      returning emigrants. Elizabeth in particular was occupied
      from morning till night in scrutinizing every corner of
      Mallards and making out a list of dilapidations against
      Lucia. There was a teacup missing, the men who removed
      Lucia's hired piano from the garden-room had scraped a
      large piece of paint off the wall, Lucia had forgotten to
      replace dearest mamma's piano which still stood in the
      telephone-room, and there was no sign of a certain
      egg-whisk. Simultaneously Diva was preparing a similar list
      for Elizabeth which would astonish her, but was pleased to
      find that the tenant had left an egg-whisk behind; while
      the wife of the labourer, not being instructed in
      dilapidations, was removing from the whitewashed wall of
      her cottage the fresco which Irene had painted there in her
      spare moments. It wasn't fit to be seen, that it wasn't,
      but a scrubbing-brush and some hot water made short work of
      all those naked people. Irene, for her part, was
      frantically searching among her canvases for a picture of
      Adam and Eve with quantities of the sons of God shouting
      for joy: an important work. Perhaps she had left it at the
      cottage, and then remembering that she had painted it on
      the wall, she hurried off there in order to varnish it
      against the inclemencies of weather. But it was already too
      late, for the last of the sons of God was even then
      disappearing under the strokes of the scrubbing-brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, though not at once, these claims and
      counterclaims were (with the exception of the fresco)
      adjusted to the general dissatisfaction. Lucia acknowledged
      the charge for the re-establishment of dearest mamma's
      piano in the garden-room, but her cook very distinctly
      remembered that on the day when Miss Mapp tried to bribe
      her to impart the secret of lobster <i>à la Riseholme,</i>
      she took away the egg-whisk, which had formed the gambit of
      Miss Mapp's vain attempt to corrupt her. So Lucia reminded
      Elizabeth that not very long ago she had called at the back
      door of Mallards and had taken it away herself. Her cook
      believed that it was in two if not three pieces. So Miss
      Mapp, having made certain it had not got put by mistake
      among the pots of preserves she had brought from Wasters,
      went to see if she had left it there, and found not it
      alone, but a preposterous list of claims against her from
      Diva. But by degrees these billows, which were of annual
      occurrence, subsided, and apart from Elizabeth's chronic
      grievance against Lucia for her hoarding the secret of the
      lobster, they and other differences in the past faded away
      and Tilling was at leisure to turn its attention again to
      the hardly more important problems and perplexities of life
      and the menaces that might have to be met in the future.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, on this morning of mid-December, was quite
      settled into Mallards again, egg-whisk and all, and the
      window of her garden-room was being once more used by the
      rightful owner for the purpose of taking observations. It
      had always been a highly strategic position; it commanded,
      for instance, a perfect view of the front door of Taormina,
      which at the present moment quaint Irene was painting in
      stripes of salmon pink and azure. She had tried to
      reproduce the lost fresco on it, but there had been earnest
      remonstrances from the Padre, and also the panels on the
      door broke it up and made it an unsuitable surface for such
      a cartoon. She therefore was contenting herself with
      brightening it up. Then Elizabeth could see the mouth of
      Porpoise Street and register all the journeys of the Royce.
      These, after a fortnight's intermission, had become
      frequent again, for the Wyses had just come back from
      'visiting friends in Devonshire', and though Elizabeth had
      strong reason to suspect that friends in Devonshire denoted
      nothing more than an hotel in Torquay, they had certainly
      taken the Royce with them, and during its absence the
      streets of Tilling had been far more convenient for
      traffic. Then there was Major Benjy's house as before,
      under her very eye, and now Mallards Cottage as well was a
      point that demanded frequent scrutiny. She had never cared
      what that distraught Isabel Poppit did, but with Georgie
      there it was different, and neither Major Benjy nor he (nor
      anybody else visiting them) could go in or out of either
      house without instant detection. The two most important men
      in Tilling, in fact, were powerless to evade her
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing particular was happening at the moment, and
      Elizabeth was making a mental retrospect rather as if she
      was the King preparing his speech for the opening of
      Parliament. Her relations with foreign powers were
      excellent, and though during the last six months there had
      been disquieting incidents, there was nothing immediately
      threatening . . . Then round the corner of the High Street
      came Lucia's car and the King's speech was put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car stopped at Taormina. Quaint Irene instantly put
      down her painting paraphernalia on the pavement, and stood
      talking into the window of the car for quite a long time.
      Clearly therefore Lucia, though invisible, was inside it.
      Eventually Irene leaned her head forward into the car,
      exactly as if she was kissing something, and stepping back
      again upset one of her paint-pots. This was pleasant, but
      not of first-rate importance compared with what the car
      would do next. It turned down into Porpoise Street:
      naturally there was no telling for certain what happened to
      it there, for it was out of sight, but a tyro could
      conjecture that it had business at the Wyses', even if he
      had been so deaf as not to hear the clanging of that
      front-door bell. Then it came backing out again, went
      through the usual manoeuvres of turning, and next stopped
      at Major Benjy's. Lucia was still invisible, but Cadman got
      down and delivered a note. The tyro could therefore
      conjecture by this time that invitations were coming from
      Grebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slid her chair a little farther back behind the
      curtain, feeling sure that the car would stop next at her
      own door. But it turned the corner below the window without
      drawing up, and Elizabeth got a fleeting glance into the
      interior, where Lucia was sitting with a large book open in
      her lap. Next it stopped at Mallards Cottage: no note was
      delivered there, but Cadman rang the bell, and presently
      Georgie came out. Like Irene, he talked for quite a long
      time into the window of the car, but, unlike her, did not
      kiss anything at the conclusion of the interview. The
      situation was therefore perfectly clear: Lucia had asked
      Irene and Major Benjy and Georgie and probably the Wyses to
      some entertainment, no doubt the house-warming of which
      there had been rumours, but had not asked her. Very well.
      The relations with foreign powers therefore had suddenly
      become far from satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth quitted her seat in the window, for she had
      observed enough to supply her with plenty of food for
      thought, and went back, in perfect self-control, to the
      inspection of her household books; adding up figures was a
      purely mechanical matter, which allowed the intenser
      emotions full play. Georgie would be coming in here
      presently, for he was painting a sketch of the interior of
      the garden-room; this was to be his Christmas present to
      Lucia (a surprise, about which she was to know nothing), to
      remind her of the happy days she had spent in it. He
      usually left his sketch here, for it was not worth while to
      take it backwards and forwards, and there it stood, propped
      up on the bookcase. He had first tried an Irene-ish
      technique, but he had been obliged to abandon that, since
      the garden-room with this handling persisted in looking
      like Paddington Station in a fog, and he had gone back to
      the style he knew, in which book-cases, chairs and curtains
      were easily recognizable. It needed a few mornings' work
      yet, and now the idea of destroying it, and, when he
      arrived, of telling him that she was quite sure he had
      taken it back with him yesterday darted unbidden into
      Elizabeth's mind. But she rejected it, though it would have
      been pleasant to deprive Lucia of her Christmas present . .
      . and she did not believe for a moment that she had ordered
      a dozen eggs on Tuesday and a dozen more on Thursday. The
      butcher's bill seemed to be correct, though extortionate,
      and she must find out as soon as possible whether the Padre
      and his wife and Diva were asked to Grebe too. If they
      were--but she banished the thought of what was to be done
      if they were: it was difficult enough to know what to do
      even if they weren't.
    </p>
    <p>
      The books were quickly done, and Elizabeth went back to
      finish reading the morning paper in the window. Just as she
      got there Georgie, with his little cape over his shoulders
      and his paint-box in his hand, came stepping briskly along
      from Mallards Cottage. Simultaneously Lucia's great bumping
      car returned round the corner by the churchyard, in the
      direction of Mallards.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspiration of purest ray serene seized Elizabeth. She
      waited till Georgie had rung the front-door bell, at which
      psychological moment Lucia's car was straight below the
      window. Without a second's hesitation Elizabeth threw up
      the sash, and, without appearing to see Lucia at all,
      called out to Georgie in a high cheerful voice, using
      baby-language.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Oo is very naughty boy, Georgie!' she cried. 'Never ring
      Elizabeth's belly-pelly. 'Oo walk straight in always, and
      sing out for her. There's no chain up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie looked round in amazement. Never had Elizabeth
      called him Georgie before, or talked to him in the language
      consecrated for his use and Lucia's. And there was Lucia's
      car close to him. She must have heard this affectionate
      welcome, and what would she think? But there was nothing to
      do but to go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still without seeing (far less cutting) Lucia, Elizabeth
      closed the window again, positively dazzled by her own
      brilliance. An hour's concentrated thought could not have
      suggested to her anything that Lucia would dislike more
      thoroughly than hearing that gay little speech, which
      parodied her and revealed such playful intimacy with
      Georgie. Georgie came straight out to the garden-room,
      saying 'Elizabeth, Elizabeth' to himself below his breath,
      in order to get used to it, for he must return this token
      of friendship in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Elizabeth,' he said firmly (and the worst
      was over until such time as he had to say it again in
      Lucia's presence).
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Georgie,' she said by way of confirmation.
      'What a lovely light for your painting this morning. Here
      it is ready for you, and Withers will bring you out your
      glass of water. How you've caught the feel of my dear
      little room!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another glance out of the window as she brought him his
      sketch was necessary, and she gasped. There was Cadman on
      the doorstep just handing Withers a note. In another minute
      she came into the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From Mrs Lucas,' she said. 'She forgot to leave it when
      she went by before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's about the house-warming, I'm sure,' said Georgie,
      getting his paint-box ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was done, was done, and there was no use in thinking
      about that. Elizabeth tore the note open.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A house-warming?' she said. 'Dear Lucia! What a treat that
      will be. Yes, you're quite right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's sending her car up for the Padre and his wife and
      Irene and Mrs Plaistow,' said Georgie, 'and asked me just
      now if I would bring you and Major Benjy. Naturally I
      will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth's brilliant speech out of the window had assumed
      the aspect of a gratuitous act of war. But she could not
      have guessed that Lucia had merely forgotten to leave her
      invitation. The most charitable would have assumed that
      there was no invitation to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How kind of you!' she said. 'To-morrow night, isn't it?
      Rather short notice. I must see if I'm disengaged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lucia had asked the whole of the élite of Tilling, this
      proved to be the case. But Elizabeth still pondered as to
      whether she should accept or not. She had committed one
      unfriendly act in talking baby-language to Georgie, with a
      pointed allusion to the door-chain, literally over Lucia's
      head, and it was a question whether, having done that, it
      would not be wise to commit another (while Lucia, it might
      be guessed, was still staggering) by refusing to go to the
      house-warming. She did not doubt that there would be war
      before long: the only question was if she was ready now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was pondering Withers came in to say that Major
      Benjy had called. He would not come out into the
      garden-room, but he would like to speak to her a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Evidently he has heard that Georgie is here,' thought
      Elizabeth to herself as she hurried into the house. 'Dear
      me, how men quarrel with each other, and I only want to be
      on good terms with everybody. No doubt he wants to know if
      I'm going to the house-warming--Good morning, Major Benjy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thought I wouldn't come out,' said this bluff fellow, 'as
      I heard your Miss Milliner Michael-Angelo, ha, was with
      you--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh Major Benjy, fie!' said Elizabeth. 'Cruel of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, leave it at that. Now about this party to-morrow. I
      think I shall make a stand straight away, for I'm not going
      to spend the whole of the winter evenings tramping through
      the mud to Grebe. To be sure it's dinner this time, which
      makes a difference.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth found that she longed to see what Lucia had made
      of Grebe, and what she had made of her speech from the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I quite agree in principle,' she said, 'but a
      house-warming, you know. Perhaps it wouldn't be kind to
      refuse. Besides, Georgie--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh?' said the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Pillson, I mean,' said Elizabeth, hastily correcting
      herself, 'has offered to drive us both down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And back?' asked he suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course. So just for once, shall we?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very good. But none of those after-dinner musicals, or
      lessons in bridge for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Major Benjy!' said Elizabeth. 'How can you talk so? As
      if poor Lucia would attempt to teach <i>you</i> bridge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This could be taken in two ways, one interpretation would
      read that he was incapable of learning, the other that
      Lucia was incapable of teaching. He took the more obvious
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon my soul she did, at the last game I had with her,'
      said he. 'Laid out the last three tricks and told me how to
      play them. Beyond a joke. Well, I won't keep you from your
      dressmaker.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O fie!' said Elizabeth again. 'Au reservoir.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, meantime, had driven back to Grebe with that mocking
      voice still ringing in her ears, and a series of most
      unpleasant images, like some diabolical film, displaying
      themselves before her inward eye. Most probably Elizabeth
      had seen her when she called out to Georgie like that, and
      was intentionally insulting her. Such conduct called for
      immediate reprisals and she must presently begin to think
      these out. But the alternative, possible though not
      probable, that Elizabeth had not seen her, was infinitely
      more wounding, for it implied that Georgie was guilty of
      treacheries too black to bear looking at. Privately, when
      she herself was not present, he was on Christian-name terms
      with that woman, and permitted and enjoyed her obvious
      mimicry of herself. And what was Georgie doing popping in
      to Mallards like this, and being scolded in baby-voice for
      ringing the bell instead of letting himself in, with
      allusions of an absolutely unmistakable kind to that
      episode about the chain? Did they laugh over that together:
      did Georgie poke fun at his oldest friend behind her back?
      Lucia positively writhed at the thought. In any case,
      whether or not he was guilty of this monstrous infidelity,
      he must be in the habit of going into Mallards, and now she
      remembered that he had his paint-box in his hand. Clearly
      then he was going there to paint, and in all their talks
      when he so constantly told her what he had been doing, he
      had never breathed a word of that. Perhaps he was painting
      Elizabeth, for in this winter weather he could never be
      painting in the garden. Just now too, when she called at
      Mallards Cottage, and they had had a talk together, he had
      refused to go out and drive with her, because he had some
      little jobs to do indoors, and the moment he had got rid of
      her--no less than that--he had hurried off to Mallards with
      his paint-box. With all this evidence, things looked very
      dark indeed, and the worst and most wounding of these two
      alternatives began to assume probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was coming to tea with her that afternoon, and she
      must find out what the truth of the matter was. But she
      could not imagine herself saying to him: 'Does she really
      call you Georgie, and does she imitate me behind my back,
      and are you painting her?' Pride absolutely forbade that:
      such humiliating inquiries would choke her. Should she show
      him an icy aloof demeanour, until he asked her if anything
      was the matter? But that wouldn't do, for either she must
      say that nothing was the matter, which would not help, or
      she must tell him what the matter was, which was
      impossible. She must behave to him exactly as usual, and he
      would probably do the same. 'So how am I to find out?' said
      the bewildered Lucia quite aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another extremely uncomfortable person in tranquil Tilling
      that morning was Georgie himself. As he painted this sketch
      of the garden-room for Lucia, with Elizabeth busying
      herself with dusting her piano and bringing in
      chrysanthemums from her greenhouse, and making bright
      little sarcasms about Diva who was in ill odour just now,
      there painted itself in his mind, in colours growing ever
      more vivid, a most ominous picture of Lucia. If he knew her
      at all, and he was sure he did, she would say nothing
      whatever about that disconcerting scene on the doorstep.
      Awkward as it would be, he would be obliged to protest his
      innocence, and denounce Elizabeth. Most disagreeable, and
      who could foresee the consequences? For Lucia (if he knew
      her) would see red, and there would be war. Bloody war of
      the most devastating sort. 'But it will be rather exciting
      too,' thought he, 'and I back Lucia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie could not wait for tea-time, but set forth on his
      uncomfortable errand soon after lunch. Lucia had seen him
      coming up the garden, and abandoned her musings and sat
      down hastily at the piano. Instantly on his entry she
      sprang up again, and plunged into mixed Italian and
      baby-talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'Ben arrivato, Georgino,'</i> she cried. 'How early you
      are, and so we can have cosy ickle chat-chat before tea.
      Any newsy-pewsy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie took the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell Lucia, presto. 'Oo think me like it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It'll interest you,' said Georgie guardedly. 'Now! When I
      was standing on Mallards doorstep this morning, did you
      hear what that old witch called to me out of the
      garden-room window?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia could not repress a sigh of relief. The worst could
      not be true. Then she became herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me see now!' she said. 'Yes. I think I did. She called
      you Georgie, didn't she: she scolded you for ringing.
      Something of that sort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And she talked baby-talk like you and me,'
      interrupted Georgie, 'and she said the door wasn't on the
      chain. I want to tell you straight off that she never
      called me Georgie before, and that we've never talked
      baby-talk together in my life. I owe it to myself to tell
      you that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia turned her piercing eye on to Georgie. There seemed
      to be a sparkle in it that boded ill for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you think she saw me, Georgie?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course she did. Your car was directly below her
      window.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am afraid there is no doubt about it,' said Lucia. 'Her
      remarks, therefore, seem to have been directed at me. A
      singularly ill-bred person. There's one thing more. You
      were taking your paint-box with you--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that's all right,' said he. 'I'm doing a sketch of the
      garden-room. You'll know about that in time. And what are
      you going to do?' he asked greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed in her most musical manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, first of all I shall give her a very good dinner
      tomorrow, as she has not had the decency to say she was
      engaged. She telephoned to me just now telling me what a
      joy it would be, and how she was looking forward to it. And
      mind you call her Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've done that already,' said Georgie proudly. 'I
      practised saying it to myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good. She dines here then to-morrow night, and I shall be
      her hostess and shall make the evening as pleasant as I can
      to all my guests. But apart from that, Georgie, I shall
      take steps to teach her manners if she's not too old to
      learn. She will be sorry; she will wish she had not been so
      rude. And I can't see any objection to our other friends in
      Tilling knowing what occurred this morning, if you feel
      inclined to speak of it. I shan't, but there's no reason
      why you shouldn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hurrah, I'm dining with the Wyses to-night,' said Georgie.
      'They'll soon know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia knitted her brows in profound thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then there's that incident about our pictures, yours
      and mine, being rejected by the hanging committee of the
      Art Club,' said she. 'We have both kept the forms we
      received saying that they regretted having to return them,
      and I think, Georgie, that while you are on the subject of
      Elizabeth Mapp, you might show yours to Mr Wyse. He is a
      member, so is Susan, of the committee, and I think they
      have a right to know that our pictures were rejected on
      official forms without ever coming before the committee at
      all. I behaved towards our poor friend with a magnanimity
      that now appears to me excessive, and since she does not
      appreciate magnanimity we will try her with something else.
      That would not be amiss.' Lucia rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now let us leave this very disagreeable subject for
      the present,' she said, 'and take the taste of it out of
      our mouths with a little music. Beethoven, noble Beethoven,
      don't you think? The fifth symphony, Georgie, for four
      hands. Fate knocking at the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie rather thought that Lucia smacked her lips as she
      said, 'this very disagreeable subject', but he was not
      certain, and presently Fate was knocking at the door with
      Lucia's firm fingers, for she took the treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a nice long practice, and when it was time to go
      home Lucia detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got one thing to say to you, Georgie,' she said,
      'though not about that paltry subject. I've sold the Hurst,
      I've bought this new property, and so I've made a new will.
      I've left Grebe and all it contains to you, and also, well,
      a little sum of money. I should like you to know that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was much touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, how wonderful of you,' he said. 'But I hope it
      will be ages and ages before--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So do I, Georgie,' she said in her most sincere manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilling had known tensions before and would doubtless know
      them again. Often it had been on a very agreeable rack of
      suspense, as when, for instance, it had believed (or
      striven to believe) that Major Benjy might be fighting a
      duel with that old crony of his, Captain Puffin, lately
      deceased. Now there was a suspense of a more intimate
      quality (for nobody would have cared at all if Captain
      Puffin had been killed, nor much, if Major Benjy), for it
      was as if the innermost social guts of Tilling were
      attached to some relentless windlass, which, at any moment
      now, might be wound, but not relaxed. The High Street next
      morning, therefore, was the scene of almost painful
      excitement. The Wyses' Royce, with Susan smothered in
      sables, went up and down, until she was practically certain
      that she had told everybody that she and Algernon had
      retired from the hanging committee of the Art Club, pending
      explanations which they had requested Miss (no longer
      Elizabeth) Mapp to furnish, but which they had no hope of
      receiving. Susan was perfectly explicit about the cause of
      this step, and Algernon who, at a very early hour, had
      interviewed the errand-boy at the frame-shop, was by her
      side, to corroborate all she said. His high-bred reticence,
      indeed, had been even more weighty than Susan's volubility.
      'I am afraid it is all too true,' was all that could be got
      out of him. Two hours had now elapsed since their
      resignations had been sent in, and still no reply had come
      from Mallards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that situation was but an insignificant fraction of the
      prevalent suspense, for the exhibition had been open and
      closed months before, and if Tilling was to make a practice
      of listening to such posthumous revelations, life would
      cease to have any poignant interest, but be wholly occupied
      in retrospective retributions. Thrilling therefore as was
      the past, as revealed by the stern occupants of the Royce,
      what had happened only yesterday on the doorstep of
      Mallards was far more engrossing. The story of that, by
      11.30 a.m., already contained several remarkable variants.
      The Padre affirmed that Georgie had essayed to enter
      Mallards without knocking, and that Miss Mapp (the tendency
      to call her Miss Mapp was spreading) had seen Lucia in her
      motor just below the window of the garden-room, and had
      called out 'Turn in, <i>Georgino mio,</i> no tarsome chains
      now that Elizabeth has got back to her own housie-pousie.'
      Diva had reason to believe that Elizabeth (she still stuck
      to that) had not seen Lucia in her motor, and had called
      out of the window to Georgie 'Ring the belly-pelly, dear,
      for I'm afraid the chain is on the door.' Mrs Bartlett (she
      was no use at all) said, 'All so distressing and exciting
      and Christmas Day next week, and very little good will, oh
      dear me!' Irene had said, 'That old witch will get what
      for.'

      Again, it was known that Major Benjy had called at Mallards
      soon after the scene, whatever it was, had taken place, and
      had refused to go into the garden-room, when he heard that
      Georgie was painting Elizabeth's portrait. Withers was
      witness (she had brought several pots of jam to Diva's
      house that morning, not vegetable marrow at all, but
      raspberry, which looked like a bribe) that the Major had
      said 'Faugh!' when she told him that Georgie was there.
      Major Benjy himself could not be cross-examined because he
      had gone out by the eleven o'clock tram to play golf. Lucia
      had not been seen in the High Street at all, nor had Miss
      Mapp, and Georgie had only passed through it in his car,
      quite early, going in the direction of Grebe. This absence
      of the principals, in these earlier stages of development,
      was felt to be in accordance with the highest rules of
      dramatic technique, and everybody, as far as was known, was
      to meet that very night at Lucia's house-warming. Opinion
      as to what would happen then was as divergent as the
      rumours of what had happened already. Some said that Miss
      Mapp had declined the invitation on the plea that she was
      engaged to dine with Major Benjy. This was unlikely,
      because he never had anybody to dinner. Some said that she
      had accepted, and that Lucia no doubt intended to send out
      a message that she was not expected, but that Georgie's car
      would take her home again. So sorry. All this, however, was
      a matter of pure conjecture, and it was work enough to sift
      out what had happened, without wasting time (for time was
      precious) in guessing what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church clock had hardly struck half-past eleven (winter
      time) before the first of the principals appeared on the
      stage of the High Street. This was Miss Mapp, wreathed in
      smiles, and occupied in her usual shopping errands. She
      trotted about from grocer to butcher, and butcher to
      general stores, where she bought a mouse-trap, and was
      exceedingly affable to tradespeople. She nodded to her
      friends, she patted Mr Woolgar's dog on the head, she gave
      a penny to a ragged individual with a lugubrious baritone
      voice who was singing 'The Last Rose of Summer', and said
      'Thank you for your sweet music.' Then after pausing for a
      moment on the pavement in front of Wasters, she rang the
      bell. Diva, who had seen her from the window, flew to open
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, Diva dear,' she said. 'I just looked in. Any
      news?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good gracious, it's I who ought to ask you that,' said
      Diva. 'What <i>did</i> happen really?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked very much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How? When? Where?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As if you didn't know,' said Diva, fizzing with
      impatience. 'Mr Georgie, Lucia, paint-boxes, no chain on
      the door, you at the garden-room window, belly-pelly.
      Etcetera. Yesterday morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth put her finger to her forehead, as if trying to
      recall some dim impression. She appeared to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear gossipy one,' she said, 'I believe I know what you
      mean. Georgie came to paint in the garden-room, as he so
      often does--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you call him Georgie?' asked Diva in an eager
      parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I fancy that's his name, and he calls me Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Elizabeth. 'Do not interrupt me, dear . . . I
      happened to be at the window as he rang the bell, and I
      just popped my head out, and told him he was a naughty boy
      not to walk straight in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In baby-talk?' asked Diva. 'Like Lucia?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like any baby you chance to mention,' said Elizabeth. 'Why
      not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But with her sitting in her car just below?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear, it so happened that she was just coming to
      leave an invitation on me for her house-warming tonight.
      Are you going?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course, everybody is. But how could you do it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sat wrapped in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm beginning to see what you mean,' she said at length.
      'But what an absurd notion. You mean, don't you, that dear
      Lulu thinks--goodness, how ridiculous--that I was mimicking
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody knows what she thinks,' said Diva. 'She's not been
      seen this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But gracious goodness me, what have I done?' asked
      Elizabeth. 'Why this excitement? Is there a law that only
      Mrs Lucas of Grebe may call Georgie, Georgie? So ignorant
      of me if there is. Ought I to call him Frederick? And pray,
      why shouldn't I talk baby-talk? Another law perhaps. I must
      get a book of the laws of England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you knew she was in the car just below you and must
      have heard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was now in possession of what she wanted to know.
      Diva was quite a decent barometer of Tilling weather, and
      the weather was stormy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rubbish, darling,' she said. 'You are making mountains out
      of mole-hills. If Lulu heard--and I don't know that she
      did, mind--what cause of complaint has she? Mayn't I say
      Georgie? Mayn't I say "vewy naughty boy"? Let us hear no
      more about it. You will see this evening how wrong you all
      are. Lulu will be just as sweet and cordial as ever. And
      you will hear with your own ears how Georgie calls me
      Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These were brave words, and they very fitly represented the
      stout heart that inspired them. Tilling had taken her
      conduct to be equivalent to an act of war, exactly as she
      had meant it to be, and if anyone thought that E. M. was
      afraid they were wrong . . . Then there was that matter of
      Mr Wyse's letter, resigning from the hanging committee. She
      must tap the barometer again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think everybody is a shade mad this morning,' she
      observed, 'and I should call Mr Wyse, if anybody asked me
      to be candid, a raving lunatic. There was a little
      misunderstanding months and months ago--I am vague about
      it--concerning two pictures that Lulu and Georgie sent in
      to the art exhibition in the summer. I thought it was all
      settled and done with. But I did act a little irregularly.
      Technically I was wrong, and when I have been wrong about a
      thing, as you very well know, dear Diva, I am not ashamed
      to confess it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course you were wrong,' said Diva cordially, 'if Mr
      Wyse's account of it is correct. You sent the pictures
      back, such beauties, too, with a formal rejection from the
      hanging committee when they had never seen them at all. So
      rash, too: I wonder at you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These unfavourable comments did not make the transaction
      appear any the less irregular.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I said I was wrong, Diva,' remarked Elizabeth with some
      asperity, 'and I should have thought that was enough. And
      now Mr Wyse, raking bygones up again in the way he has, has
      written to me to say that he and Susan resign their places
      on the hanging committee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know: they told everybody,' said Diva. 'Awkward. What
      are you going to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The barometer had jerked alarmingly downwards on this
      renewed tapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall cry peccavi,' said Elizabeth, with the air of
      doing something exceedingly noble. 'I shall myself resign.
      That will show that whatever anybody else does, I am doing
      the best in my power to put right a technical error. I hope
      Mr Wyse will appreciate that, and be ashamed of the letter
      he wrote me. More than that, I shall regard his letter as
      having been written in a fit of temporary insanity, which I
      trust will not recur.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; I suppose that's the best thing you can do,' said
      Diva. 'It will show him that you regret what you did, now
      that it's all found out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is not generous of you, Diva,' cried Elizabeth, 'I am
      sorry you said that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'More than I am,' said Diva. 'It's a very fair statement.
      Isn't it now? What's wrong with it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth suddenly perceived that at this crisis it was
      unwise to indulge in her usual tiffs with Diva. She wanted
      allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva, dear, we mustn't quarrel,' she said. 'That would
      never do. I felt I had to pop in to consult you as to the
      right course to take with Mr Wyse, and I'm so glad you
      agree with me. How I trust your judgment! I must be going.
      What a delightful evening we have in store for us. Major
      Benjy was thinking of declining, but I persuaded him it
      would not be kind. A house-warming, you know. Such a
      special occasion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening to which everybody had looked forward so much
      was, in the main, a disappointment to bellicose spirits.
      Nothing could exceed Lucia's cordiality to Elizabeth unless
      it was Elizabeth's to Lucia: they left the dining-room at
      the end of dinner with arms and waists intertwined, a very
      bitter sight. They then played bridge at the same table,
      and so loaded each other with compliments while deploring
      their own errors, that Diva began to entertain the most
      serious fears that they had been mean enough to make it up
      on the sly, or that Lucia in a spirit of Christian
      forbearance, positively unnatural, had decided to overlook
      all the attacks and insults with which Elizabeth had tried
      to provoke her. Or did Lucia think that this degrading
      display of magnanimity was a weapon by which she would
      secure victory, by enlisting for her the sympathy and
      applause of Tilling? If so, that was a great mistake;
      Tilling did not want to witness a demonstration of
      forgiveness or white feathers but a combat without quarter.
      Again, if she thought that such nobility would soften the
      malevolent heart of Mapp, she showed a distressing
      ignorance of Mapp's nature, for she would quite properly
      construe this as not being nobility at all but the most
      ignoble cowardice. There was Georgie under Lucia's very
      nose, interlarding his conversation with far more
      'Elizabeths' than was in the least necessary to show that
      he was talking to her, and she volleyed 'Georgies' at him
      in return. Every now and then, when these discharges of
      Christian names had been particularly resonant, Elizabeth
      caught Diva's eye with a glance of triumph as if to remind
      her that she had prophesied that Lulu would be all
      sweetness and cordiality, and Diva turned away sick at
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there were still grounds for hope, and,
      as the evening went on, these became more promising: they
      were like small caps of foam and cats'-paws of wind upon a
      tranquil sea. To begin with, it was only this morning that
      the baseness of Elizabeth in that matter concerning the art
      committee had come to light. Georgie, not Lucia, had been
      directly responsible for that damning disclosure, but it
      must be supposed that he had acted with her connivance, if
      not with her express wish, and this certainly did not look
      so much like forgiveness as a nasty one for Elizabeth. That
      was hopeful, and Diva's eagle eye espied other signs of bad
      weather. Elizabeth, encouraged by Lucia's compliments and
      humilities throughout a long rubber, began to come out more
      in her true colours, and to explain to her partner that she
      had lost a few tricks (no matter) by not taking a finesse,
      or a whole game by not supporting her declaration, and Diva
      thought she detected a certain dangerous glitter in Lucia's
      eye as she bent to these chastisements. Surely, too, she
      bit her lip when Elizabeth suddenly began to call her Lulu
      again. Then there was Irene's conduct to consider: Irene
      was fizzing and fidgeting in her chair, she cast glances of
      black hatred at Elizabeth, and once Diva distinctly saw
      Lucia frown and shake her head at her. Again, at the
      voluptuous supper which succeeded many rubbers of bridge,
      there was the famous lobster <i>à la Riseholme.</i> It had
      become, as all Tilling knew, a positive obsession with
      Elizabeth to get the secret of that delicious dish, and
      now, flushed with continuous victories at bridge and with
      Lucia's persevering pleasantness, she made another direct
      request for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lulu dear,' she said, 'it would be sweet of you to give me
      the recipe for your lobster. So good . . .'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva felt this to be a crucial moment: Lucia had often
      refused it before, but now if she was wholly Christian and
      cowardly she would consent. But once more she gave no
      reply, and asked the Padre on what day of the week
      Christmas fell. So Diva heaved a sigh of relief, for there
      was still hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this rebuff, it was hardly to be wondered at
      that Elizabeth felt in a high state of elation when the
      evening was over. The returning revellers changed the order
      of their going, and Georgie took back her and Diva. He went
      outside with Diva, for, during the last half-hour, Mapp (as
      he now mentally termed her in order to be done with
      Elizabeth) had grown like a mushroom in complaisance and
      self-confidence, and he could not trust himself, if she
      went on, as she would no doubt do, in the same strain, not
      to rap out something very sharp. 'Let her just wait,' he
      thought, 'she'll soon be singing a different tune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's precautions in going outside, well wrapped up in
      his cap and his fur tippet and his fur rug, were well
      founded, for hardly had Mapp kissed her hand for the last
      time to Lulu (who would come to the door to see them off),
      and counted over the money she had won, than she burst into
      staves of intolerable triumph and condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So that's that!' she said, pulling up the window. 'And if
      I was to ask you, dear Diva, which of us was right about
      how this evening would go off, I don't think there would be
      very much doubt about the answer. Did you ever see Lulu so
      terribly anxious to please me? And did you happen to hear
      me say Georgie and him say Elizabeth? Lulu didn't like it,
      I am sure, but she had to swallow her medicine, and she did
      so with a very good grace, I am bound to say. She just
      wanted a little lesson, and I think I may say I've given it
      her. I had no idea, I will confess, that she would take it
      lying down like that. I just had to lean out of the window,
      pretend not to see her, and talk to Georgie in that silly
      voice and language and the thing was done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva had been talking simultaneously for some time, but
      Elizabeth only paused to take breath, and went on in a
      slightly louder tone. So Diva talked louder too, until
      Georgie turned round to see what was happening. They both
      broke off, and smiled at him, and then both began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you would allow me to get a word in edgeways,' said
      Diva, who had some solid arguments to produce, and, had she
      not been a lady, could have slapped Mapp's face in impotent
      rage--
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think,' said Elizabeth, 'that we shall have much
      more trouble with her and her queenly airs. Quite a
      pleasant house-warming, and there was no doubt that the
      house wanted it, for it was bitterly cold in the
      dining-room, and I strongly suspect that chicken-cream of
      being rabbit. She only had to be shown that whatever
      Riseholme may have stood from her in the way of
      condescensions and graces, she had better not try them on
      at Tilling. She was looking forward to teaching us, and
      ruling us and guiding us. Pop! Elizabeth (that's me, dear!)
      has a little lamb, which lives at Grebe and gives a
      house-warming, so you may guess who <i>that</i> is. The way
      she flattered and sued to-night over our cards when but a
      few weeks ago she was thinking of holding bridge classes--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were just as bad,' shouted Diva. 'You told her she
      played beauti--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was "all over me", to use that dreadful slang
      expression of Major Benjy's,' continued Mapp. 'She was like
      a dog that has had a scolding and begs--so prettily--to be
      forgiven. Mind, dear, I do not say that she is a bad sort
      of woman by any means, but she required to be put in her
      place, and Tilling ought to thank me for having done so.
      Dear me, here we are already at your house. How short the
      drive has seemed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyhow, you didn't get the recipe for the lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme,</i>' said Diva, for this was one of the things
      she most wanted to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A little final wriggle,' said Mapp. 'I have not the least
      doubt that she will think it over and send it me to-morrow.
      Good night, darling. I shall be sending out invitations for
      a cosy evening of bridge some time at the end of this
      week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The baffled Diva let herself into Wasters in low spirits,
      so convinced and lucid had been Mapp's comments on the
      evening. It was such a dismal conclusion to so much
      excitement; and all that thrilling tension, instead of
      snapping, had relaxed into the most depressing slackness.
      But she did not quite give up hope, for there had been
      cats'-paws and caps of foam on the tranquil sea. She fell
      asleep visualizing these.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Though Georgie had thought that the garden-room would have
      to give him at least two more sittings before his sketch
      arrived at that high state of finish which he, like the
      Pre-Raphaelites, regarded as necessary to any work of art,
      he decided that he would leave it in a more impressionist
      state, and sent it next morning to be framed. In
      consequence the glass of water which Elizabeth had brought
      out for him in anticipation of his now usual visit at
      eleven o'clock remained unsullied by washings from his
      brush, and at twelve, Elizabeth, being rather thirsty in
      consequence of so late a supper the night before, drank it
      herself. On the second morning, a very wet one, Major Benjy
      did not go out for his usual round of golf, and again
      Georgie did not come to paint. But at a few minutes to one
      she observed that his car was at the door of Mallards
      Cottage; it passed her window, it stopped at Major Benjy's,
      and he got in. It was impossible not to remember that Lucia
      always lunched at one in the winter because a later hour
      for <i>colazione</i> made the afternoon so short. But it
      was a surprise to see Major Benjy driving away with Miss
      Milliner Michael-Angelo, and difficult to conjecture where
      else it was at all likely that they could have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was half an hour yet to her own luncheon, and she
      wrote seven post cards inviting seven friends to tea on
      Saturday, with bridge to follow. The Wyses, the Padres,
      Diva, Major Benjy and Georgie were the <i>destinataires</i>
      of these missives; these, with herself, made eight, and
      there would thus be two tables of agreeable gamblers. Lucia
      was not to be favoured: it would be salutary for her to be
      left out every now and then, just to impress upon her the
      lesson of which she had stood so sadly in need. She must
      learn to go to heel, to come when called, and to produce
      recipes when desired, which at present she had not done.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been several days of heavy rain, but early in the
      afternoon it cleared up, and Elizabeth set out for a brisk
      healthy walk. The field-paths would certainly make very
      miry going, for she saw from the end of the High Street
      that there was much water lying in the marsh, and she
      therefore kept to that excellent road, which, having passed
      Grebe, went nowhere particular. She was prepared to go in
      and thank Lucia for her lovely house-warming, in order to
      make sure whether Georgie and Major Benjy had gone to lunch
      with her, but no such humiliating need occurred, for there
      in front of the house was drawn up Georgie's motor-car, so
      (whether she liked it or not, and she didn't) <i>that</i>
      problem was solved. The house stood quite close to the
      road: a flagged pathway of half a dozen yards, flanked at
      the entrance-gate by thick hornbeam hedges on which the
      leaf still lingered, separated it from the road, and just
      as Elizabeth passed Georgie's car drawn up there, the front
      door opened, and she saw Lucia and her two guests on the
      threshold. Major Benjy was laughing in that fat voice of
      his, and Georgie was giving forth his shrill little neighs
      like a colt with a half-cracked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temptation to know what they were laughing at was
      irresistible. Elizabeth moved a few steps on and, screened
      by the hornbeam hedge, held her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy gave another great haw-haw and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon my word, did she really?' he said. 'Do it again, Mrs
      Lucas. Never laughed so much in my life. Infernal
      impertinence!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the voice and the words that
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Oo is vewy naughty boy, Georgie,' said Lucia. 'Never ring
      Elizabeth's belly-pelly--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth hurried on, as she heard steps coming down that
      short flagged pathway. But hurry as she might, she heard a
      little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Oo walk straight in always and sing out for her,'
      continued the voice, repeating word for word the speech of
      which she had been so proud. 'There's no chain up'--and
      then came loathsome parody--'now that Liblib has ritornata
      to Mallardino.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a scared mood, as if she had heard or seen a
      ghost, that Elizabeth hastened along up the road that led
      nowhere in particular, before Lucia's guests could emerge
      from the gate. Luckily at the end of the kitchen-garden the
      hornbeam hedge turned at right angles, and behind this
      bastion she hid herself till she heard the motor move away
      in the direction of Tilling, the prey of the most agitated
      misgivings. Was it possible that her own speech, which she
      had thought had scarified Lucia's pride, was being turned
      into a mockery and a derision against herself? It seemed
      not only possible but probable. And how dare Mrs Lucas
      invent and repeat as if spoken by herself that rubbish
      about ritornata and Mallardino? Never in her life had she
      said such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coast was clear, she took the road again, and
      walked quickly on away from Tilling. The tide was very
      high, for the river was swollen with rain, and the waters
      overbrimmed its channel and extended in a great lake up to
      the foot of the bank and dyke which bounded the road.
      Perturbed as she was, Miss Mapp could not help admiring
      that broad expanse of water, now lit by a gleam of sun, in
      front of which to the westward, the hill of Tilling rose
      dark against a sky already growing red with the winter
      sunset. She had just turned a corner in the road, and now
      she perceived that close ahead of her somebody else was
      admiring it too in a more practical manner, for there by
      the roadside within twenty yards of her sat quaint Irene,
      with her mouth full of paint-brushes and an easel set up in
      front of her. She had not seen Irene since the night of the
      house-warming, when the quaint one had not been very
      cordial, and so, thinking she had walked far enough, she
      turned back. But Irene had quite evidently seen her, for
      she shaded her eyes for a moment against the glare, took
      some of the paint-brushes out of her mouth and called to
      her with words that seemed to have what might be termed a
      dangerous undertow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hullo, Mapp,' she said. 'Been lunching with Lulu?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a lovely sketch, dear,' said Mapp. 'No, just a brisk
      little walk. Not been lunching at Grebe to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene laughed hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't think it was very likely, but thought I would
      ask,' she said. 'Yes; I'm rather pleased with my sketch. A
      bloody look about the sunlight, isn't there, as if the Day
      of Judgment was coming. I'm going to send it to the winter
      exhibition of the Art Club.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear girlie, what do you mean?' asked Mapp. 'We don't have
      winter exhibitions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but we're going to,' said girlie. 'A new hanging
      committee, you see, full of pep and pop and vim. Haven't
      they asked you to send them something . . . Of course the
      space at their disposal is very limited.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mapp laughed, but not with any great exuberance. This
      undertow was tweaking at her disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's news to me,' she said. 'Most enterprising of Mr
      Wyse and dear Susan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet Lulu's idea,' said Irene. 'As soon as you sent in
      your resignation, of course they asked her to be
      President.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is nice for her,' said Mapp enthusiastically. 'She
      will like that. I must get to work on some little picky to
      send them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's that one you did from the church tower when Lucia
      had influenza,' said this awful Irene. 'That would be nice
      . . . Oh, I forgot. Stupid of me. It's by invitation: the
      committee are asking a few people to send pickies. No doubt
      they'll beg you for one. Such a good plan. There won't be
      any mistakes in the future about rejecting what is sent
      in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mapp gave a gulp but rallied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see. They'll be all Academicians together, and be hung
      on the line,' said she unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. On the line or be put on easels,' said Irene. 'Curse
      the light! It's fading. I must pack up. Hold these brushes,
      will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then we'll walk back home together, shall we? A cup of
      tea with me, dear?' asked Mapp, anxious to conciliate and
      to know more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm going into Lucia's, I'm afraid. Wyses tummin' to play
      bridgey and hold a committee meeting,' said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a cruel thing to imitate poor Lulu,' said Mapp.
      'How well you've caught that silly baby-talk of hers. Just
      her voice. Bye-bye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Same to you,' said Irene.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was undoubtedly, thought Mapp, as she scudded swiftly
      homewards alone, a sort of mocking note about quaint
      Irene's conversation, which she did not relish. It was full
      of hints and awkward allusions; it bristled with hidden
      menace, and even her imitation of Lucia's baby-talk was not
      wholly satisfactory, for quaint Irene might be mimicking
      her imitation of Lucia, even as Lucia herself had done, and
      there was very little humour in that. Presently she passed
      the Wyses' Royce going to Grebe. She kissed her hand to a
      mound of sables inside, but it was too dark to see if the
      salute was returned. Her brisk afternoon's walk had not
      freshened her up; she was aware of a feeling of fatigue, of
      a vague depression and anxiety. And mixed with that was a
      hunger not only for tea but for more information. There
      seemed to be things going on of which she was sadly
      ignorant, and even when her ignorance was enlightened, they
      remained rather sad. But Diva (such a gossip) might know
      more about this winter exhibition, and she popped into
      Wasters. Diva was in, and begged her to wait for tea: she
      would be down in a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cosy little room, looking out on to the garden
      which had yielded her so many pots of excellent preserves
      during the summer, but dreadfully untidy, as Diva's house
      always was. There was a litter of papers on the table,
      notes half-thrust back into their envelopes, crossword
      puzzles cut out from the <i>Evening Standard</i> and
      partially solved: there was her own post card to Diva sent
      off that morning and already delivered, and there was a
      sheet of paper with the stamp of Grebe upon it and Lucia's
      monogram, which seemed to force itself on Elizabeth's eye.
      The most cursory glance revealed that this was a request
      from the Art Committee that Mrs Plaistow would do them the
      honour to send them a couple of her sketches for the
      forthcoming winter exhibition. All the time there came from
      Diva's bedroom, directly overhead, the sound of rhythmical
      steps or thumps, most difficult to explain. In a few
      minutes these ceased, and Diva's tread on the stairs gave
      Elizabeth sufficient warning to enable her to snatch up the
      first book that came to hand, and sink into a chair by the
      fire. She saw, with some feeling of apprehension similar to
      those which had haunted her all afternoon, that this was a
      copy of <i>An Ideal System of Callisthenics for those no
      longer Young,</i> of which she seemed to have heard. On the
      title-page was an inscription 'Diva from Lucia', and in
      brackets, like a prescription, 'Ten minutes at the
      exercises in Chapter I, twice a day for the present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva entered very briskly. She was redder in the face than
      usual, and, so Elizabeth instantly noticed, lifted her feet
      very high as she walked, and held her head well back and
      her breast out like a fat little pigeon. This time there
      was to be no question about getting a word in edgeways, for
      she began to talk before the door was fully open.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad to see you, Elizabeth,' she said, 'and I shall be
      very pleased to play bridge on Saturday. I've never felt so
      well in my life, do you know, and I've only been doing them
      two days. Oh, I see you've got the book.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I heard you stamping and thumping, dear,' said Elizabeth.
      'Was that them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, twice a day, ten minutes each time. It clears the
      head, too. If you sit down to a crossword puzzle afterwards
      you find you're much brighter than usual.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Callisthenics <i>à la Lucia?'</i> asked Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Irene and Mrs Bartlett and I all do them, and Mrs
      Wyse is going to begin, but rather more gently. Hasn't
      Lucia told you about them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was another revelation of things happening. Elizabeth
      met it bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Dear Lulu knows my feelings about that sort of fad. A
      brisk walk such as I've had this afternoon is all I
      require. Such lovely lights of sunset and a very high tide.
      Quaint Irene was sketching on the road just beyond Grebe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She's going to send it in and three more for the
      winter exhibition. Oh, perhaps you haven't heard. There's
      to be an exhibition directly after Christmas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a good idea: I've been discussing it,' said
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva's eye travelled swiftly and suspiciously to the table
      where this flattering request to her lay on the top of the
      litter. Elizabeth did not fail to catch the significance of
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Irene told me,' she said hastily, 'I must see if I can
      find time to do them something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, then they have asked you,' said Diva with a shade of
      disappointment in her voice. 'They've asked me too--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! Really?' said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--so of course I said yes, but I'm afraid I'm rather out
      of practice. Lucia is going to give an address on modern
      art at the opening, and then we shall all go round and look
      at each other's pictures.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What fun!' said Elizabeth cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea had been brought in. There was a pot of greenish jam
      and Elizabeth loaded her buttered toast with it, and put it
      into her mouth. She gave a choking cry and washed it down
      with a gulp of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anything wrong?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dear. I'm afraid it's fermenting,' said Elizabeth,
      laying down the rest of her toast. 'And I can't conceive
      what it's made of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva looked at the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You ought to know,' she said. 'It's one of the pots you
      gave me. Labelled vegetable marrow. So sorry it's not
      eatable. By the way, talking of food, did Lucia send you
      the recipe for the lobster?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth smiled her sweetest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Lucia,' she said. 'She's been so busy with art and
      callisthenics. She must have forgotten. I shall jog her
      memory.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon had been full of rather unpleasant surprises,
      thought Elizabeth to herself, as she went up to Mallards
      that evening. They were concerned with local activities,
      art and gymnastics, of which she had hitherto heard
      nothing, and they all seemed to show a common origin: there
      was a hidden hand directing them. This was disconcerting,
      especially since, only a few nights ago, she had felt so
      sure that that hand had been upraised to her, beseeching
      pardon. Now it rather looked as if that hand had spirited
      itself away and was very busy and energetic on its own
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused on her doorstep. There was a light shining out
      through chinks behind the curtains in Mallards Cottage, and
      she thought it would be a good thing to pop in on Georgie
      and see if she could gather some further gleanings. She
      would make herself extremely pleasant: she would admire his
      needlework if he was at it, she would praise the beautiful
      specklessness of his room, for Georgie always appreciated
      any compliment to Foljambe, she would sing the praises of
      Lucia, though they blistered her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe admitted her. The door of the sitting-room was
      ajar, and as she put down her umbrella, she heard Georgie's
      voice talking to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Saturday, half-past four,' he said. 'I've just found a
      post card. Hasn't she asked you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, as Elizabeth had often observed, was deafer than
      he knew (which accounted for his not hearing all the wrong
      notes she played in his duets with Lucia) and he had not
      heard her entry, though Foljambe spoke her name quite loud.
      He was listening with rapt attention to what was coming
      through and saying 'My dear!' or 'No!' at intervals. Now,
      however, he turned and saw her, and with a scared
      expression hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me, I never heard you come in!' he said. 'How nice! I
      was just going to tell Foljambe to bring up tea. Two cups,
      Foljambe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm interrupting you,' said Elizabeth. 'I can see you were
      just settling down to your sewing and a cosy bachelor
      evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a bit,' said Georgie. 'Do have a chair near the fire.'
      It was not necessary to explain that she had already had
      tea with Diva, even if one mouthful of fermenting vegetable
      could properly be called tea, and she took the chair he
      pulled up for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such beautiful work,' she said, looking at Georgie's
      tambour of <i>petit point,</i> which lay near by. 'What
      eyes you must have to be able to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, they're pretty good yet,' said Georgie, slipping his
      spectacle-case into his pocket. 'And I shall be delighted
      to come to tea and bridge on Saturday. Thanks so much. Just
      got your invitation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mapp knew that already.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's charming,' she said. 'And how I envy you your
      Foljambe. Not a speck of dust anywhere. You could eat your
      tea off the floor, as they say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie noticed that she did not use his Christian name.
      This confirmed his belief that the employment of it was
      reserved for Lucia's presence as an annoyance to her. Then
      the telephone-bell rang again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I?' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went across to it, rather nervous. It was as he thought:
      Lucia was at it again, explaining that somebody had cut her
      off. Listen as she might, Miss Mapp, from where she sat,
      could only hear a confused quacking noise. So to show how
      indifferent she was as to the conversation, she put her
      fingers close to her ears ready to stop them when Georgie
      turned round again, and listened hard to what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes . . . yes,' said Georgie. 'Thanks so much--lovely.
      I'll pick him up then, shall I? Quarter to eight, is it?
      Yes, her too. Yes, I've done them once to-day: not a bit
      giddy . . . I can't stop now, Lucia. Miss Ma--Elizabeth's
      just come in for a cup of tea . . . I'll tell her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth felt she understood all this; she was an adept at
      telephonic reconstruction. There was evidently another
      party at Grebe. 'Him' and 'her' no doubt were Major Benjy
      and herself, whom Georgie would pick up as before. 'Them'
      were exercises, and Georgie's promise to tell 'her' clearly
      meant that he should convey an invitation. This was
      satisfactory: evidently Lucia was hoping to propitiate.
      Then Georgie turned round and saw Elizabeth smiling gaily
      at the fire with her hands over her ears. He moved into her
      field of vision and she uncorked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Finished?' she said. 'Hope you did not cut it short
      because of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' said Georgie, for she couldn't (unless she
      was pretending) have heard him say that he had done
      precisely that. 'It was Lucia ringing up. She sends you her
      love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sweet of her, such a pet,' said Elizabeth, and waited for
      more about picking up and that invitation. But Lucia's love
      appeared to be all, and Georgie asked her if she took
      sugar. She did, and tried if he in turn would take another
      sort of sugar, both for himself and Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a lovely house-warming,' she said, 'and how we all
      enjoyed ourselves. Lucia seems to have time for everything,
      bridge, those lovely duets with you, Italian, Greek (though
      we haven't heard much about that lately), a winter art
      exhibition, and an address (how I shall look forward to
      it!) on modern art, callisthenics--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you ought to try those,' said Georgie. 'You stretch
      and stamp and feel ever so young afterwards. We're all
      doing them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And does she take classes as she threat--promised to do?'
      asked Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She will when we've mastered the elements,' said Georgie.
      'We shall march round the kitchen-garden at Grebe--cinder
      paths you know, so good in wet weather--keeping time, and
      then skip and flex and jerk. And if it's raining we shall
      do them in the kitchen. You can throw open those double
      doors, and have plenty of fresh air which is so important.
      There's that enormous kitchen-table too, to hold on to,
      when we're doing that swimming movement. It's like a great
      raft.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth had not the nerve to ask if Major Benjy was to be
      of that company. It would be too bitter to know that he,
      who had so sternly set his face against Lucia's domination,
      was in process of being sucked down in that infernal
      whirlpool of her energetic grabbings. Almost she wished
      that she had asked her to be one of her bridge-party
      to-morrow: but it was too late now. Her seven
      invitations--seven against Lucia--had gone forth, and not
      till she got home would she know whether her two
      bridge-tables were full.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And this winter exhibition,' she asked. 'What a good idea!
      We're all so idle in the winter at dear old Tilling, and
      now there's another thing to work for. Are you sending that
      delicious picture of the garden-room? How I enjoyed our
      lovely chatty mornings when you were painting it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      By the ordinary rules of polite conversation, Georgie ought
      to have asked her what she was sending. He did nothing of
      the kind, but looked a little uncomfortable. Probably then,
      as Irene had told her, the exhibition was to consist of
      pictures sent by request of the committee, and at present
      they had not requested her. She felt that she must make
      sure about that, and determined to send in a picture
      without being asked. That would show for certain what was
      going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Weren't those mornings pleasant?' said the evasive
      Georgie. 'I was quite sorry when my picture was finished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie appeared unusually reticent: he did not volunteer
      any more information about the winter exhibition, nor about
      Lucia's telephoning, nor had he mentioned that he and Major
      Benjy had lunched with her to-day. She would lead him in
      the direction of that topic . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      'How happy dear Lucia is in her pretty Grebe,' she said. 'I
      took my walk along the road there to-day. Her garden, so
      pleasant! A high tide this afternoon. The beautiful river
      flowing down to the sea, and the tide coming up to meet it.
      Did you notice it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie easily saw through that: he would talk about tides
      with pleasure, but not lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It looked lovely,' he said, 'but they tell me that in ten
      days' time the spring tides are on, and they will be much
      higher. The water has been over the road in front of
      Lucia's house sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth went back to Mallards more uneasy than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was indeed busy arranging callisthenic classes and
      winter exhibitions and, clearly, some party at Grebe, but
      not a word had she said to her about any of these things,
      nor had she sent the recipe for lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme.</i> But there was nothing more to be done
      to-night except to take steps concerning the picture
      exhibition to which she had not been asked to contribute.
      The house was full of her sketches, and she selected quite
      the best of them and directed Withers to pack it up and
      send it, with her card, to the Committee of the Art Club,
      Grebe.

      The winter bridge-parties in Tilling were in their main
      features of a fixed and invariable pattern. An exceedingly
      substantial tea, including potted-meat sandwiches, was
      served at half-past four, and, after that was disposed of,
      at least three hours of bridge followed. After such a tea,
      nobody, as was perfectly well known, dreamed of having
      dinner: and though round about eight o'clock, the party
      broke up, with cries of astonishment at the lateness of the
      hour, and said it must fly back home to dress, this was a
      mere fashion of speech. 'A tray' was the utmost refreshment
      that anyone could require, and nobody dressed for a
      solitary tray. Elizabeth was a great upholder of the
      dress-and-dinner fiction, and she had been known to leave a
      bridge-party at nine, saying that Withers would scold her
      for being so late, and that her cook would be furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on this Saturday afternoon the party of eight (for all
      seven had accepted) assembled at Mallards. They were
      exceedingly cordial: it was as if they desired to
      propitiate their hostess for something presently to emerge.
      Also it struck that powerful observer that there was not
      nearly so much eaten as usual. She had provided the caviare
      sandwiches of which Mrs Wyse had been known absentmindedly
      to eat nine, she had provided the nougat chocolates of
      which Diva had been known to have eaten all, but though the
      chocolates were in front of Diva, and the caviare in front
      of Susan, neither of them exhibited anything resembling
      their usual greed. There was Scotch shortbread for the
      Padre, who, though he came from Birmingham, was insatiable
      with regard to that national form of biscuit, and there was
      whisky and soda for Major Benjy, who had no use for tea,
      and both of them, too, were mysteriously abstemious.
      Perhaps this wet muggy weather, thought Elizabeth, had made
      them all a trifle liverish, or very likely those
      callisthenics had taken away their appetites. It was
      noticeable, moreover, that throughout tea nobody mentioned
      the name of Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They adjourned to the garden-room where two tables were set
      out for bridge, and till half-past six nothing momentous
      occurred. At that hour Elizabeth was partner to Major
      Benjy, and she observed with dark misgivings that when she
      had secured the play of the hand (at a staggering
      sacrifice, as it was soon to prove) he did not as usual
      watch her play, but got up, and standing by the fireplace
      indulged in some very antic movements. He bent down,
      apparently trying to touch his toes with his fingers and a
      perfect fusillade of small crackling noises from his joints
      (knee or hip it was impossible to tell) accompanied these
      athletic flexings. Then he whisked himself round to right
      and left as if trying to look down his back, like a parrot.
      This was odd and ominous conduct, this strongly suggested
      that he had been sucked into the callisthenic whirlpool,
      and what was more ominous yet was that when he sat down
      again he whispered to Georgie, who was at the same table,
      'That makes my ten minutes, old boy.' Elizabeth did not
      like that at all. She knew now what the ten minutes must
      refer to, and that endearing form of address to Miss
      Milliner Michael-Angelo was a little worrying. The only
      consolation was that Georgie's attention was diverted from
      the game, and that he trumped his partner's best card. At
      the conclusion of the hand, Elizabeth was three tricks
      short of her contract, and another very puzzling surprise
      awaited her, for instead of Major Benjy taking her failure
      in very ill part, he was more than pleasant about it. What
      could be the matter with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well played, Miss Elizabeth,' he said. 'I was afraid
      that after my inexcusable declaration we should lose more
      than that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth began to feel more keenly puzzled as to why none
      of them had any appetites, and why they were all so
      pleasant to her. Were they rallying round her again, was
      their silence about Lucia a tactful approval of her
      absence? Or was there some hidden connection between their
      abstemiousness, their reticence and their unwontedly
      propitiatory attitude? If there was, it quite eluded her.
      Then as Diva dealt in her sloppy manner Lucia's name came
      up for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Georgie, you ought not to have led trumps,' she said.
      'Lucia always says--Oh, dear me, I believe I've misdealt.
      Oh no, I haven't. That's all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth pondered this as she sorted her cards. Nobody
      inquired what Lucia said, and Diva's swift changing of the
      subject as if that name had slipped out by accident, looked
      as if possibly they none of them desired any allusion to be
      made to her. Had they done with her? she wondered. But if
      so, what about the callisthenics?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dummy now and was absorbed in watching Major
      Benjy's tragical mismanagement of the hand, for he was
      getting into a sadder bungle than anyone, except perhaps
      Lucia, could have involved himself in. Withers entered
      while this was going on, and gave Elizabeth a parcel. With
      her eye and her mind still glued to the cards, she absently
      unwrapped it, and took its contents from its coverings just
      as the last trick was being played. It was the picture she
      had sent to the art committee the day before and with it
      was a typewritten form to convey its regrets that the
      limited wall-space at its disposal would not permit of Miss
      Mapp's picture being exhibited. This slip floated out on to
      the floor, and Georgie bent down and returned it to her.
      She handed it and the picture and the wrappings to Withers,
      and told her to put them in the cupboard. Then she leaned
      over the table to her partner, livid with mixed and
      uncontrollable emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Major Benjy, what a hash!' she said. 'If you had
      pulled out your cards at random from your hand, you could
      not, bar revokes, have done worse. I think you must have
      been having lessons from dear Lulu. Never mind: live and
      unlearn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awful pause. Even the players at the other
      table were stricken into immobility and looked at each
      other with imbecile eyes. Then the most surprising thing of
      all happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Pon my word, partner,' said Major Benjy, 'I deserve all
      the scoldings you can give me. I played it like a baby. I
      deserve to pay all our losings. A thousand apologies.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, though she did not feel like it, had to show
      that she was generous too. But why didn't he answer her
      back in the usual manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naughty Major Benjy!' she said. 'But what does it matter?
      It's only a game, and we all have our ups and downs. I have
      them myself. That's the rubber, isn't it? Not very
      expensive after all. Now let us have another and forget all
      about this one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva drew a long breath, as if making up her mind to
      something, and glanced at the watch set with false pearls
      (Elizabeth was sure) on her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather late to begin again,' she said. 'I make it ten
      minutes to seven. I think I ought to be going to dress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, dear,' said Elizabeth. 'Much too early to leave
      off. Cut, Major Benjy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He also appeared to take his courage in his hands, not very
      successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, upon my word, do you know, really Miss Elizabeth,'
      he babbled, 'a rubber goes on sometimes for a very long
      while, and if it's close on seven now, if, you know what I
      mean . . . What do you say, Pillson?' It was Georgie's
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too tarsome,' he said, 'but I'm afraid personally that I
      must stop. Such a delightful evening. Such good rubbers . .
      .'
    </p>
    <p>
      They all got up together, as if some common mechanism
      controlled their movements. Diva scuttled away to the other
      table, without even waiting to be paid the sum of one and
      threepence which she had won from Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll see how they're getting on here,' she said. 'Why
      they're just adding up, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sat where she was and counted out fifteen
      pennies.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would serve Diva right for going at ten minutes to
      seven. Then she saw that the others had got up in a hurry,
      for Susan Wyse said to Mrs Bartlett, 'I'll pay you later
      on,' and her husband held up her sable coat for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva, your winnings,' said Elizabeth, piling up the
      coppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva whisked round, and instead of resenting this ponderous
      discharge of the debt, received it with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, Elizabeth,' she said. 'All coppers: how nice!
      So useful for change. Good night, dear. Thanks ever so
      much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment by the door, already open, by which
      Georgie was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you'll call for me at twenty minutes to eight,' she
      said to him in the most audible whisper, and Georgie with a
      nervous glance in Elizabeth's direction gave a silent
      assent. Diva vanished into the night where Major Benjy had
      gone. Elizabeth rose from her deserted table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you're not all going too?' she said to the others. 'So
      early yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse made a profound bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I regret that my wife and I must get home to dress,' he
      said. 'But one of the most charming evenings of bridge I
      have ever spent, Miss Mapp. So many thanks. Come along,
      Susan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Delicious bridge,' said Susan. 'And those caviare
      sandwiches. Good night, dear. You must come round and play
      with us some night soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A grand game of bridge, Mistress Mapp,' said the Padre.
      'Ah, wee wifie's callin' for me. Au reservoir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment Elizabeth was alone. Georgie had followed on
      the heels of the others, closing the door very carefully,
      as if she had fallen asleep. Instead of that she hurried to
      the window and peeped out between the curtains. There were
      three or four of them standing on the steps while the Wyses
      got into the Royce, and they dispersed in different
      directions like detected conspirators, as no doubt they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The odd disconnected little incidents of the evening, the
      lack of appetites, the propitiatory conduct to herself,
      culminating in this unexampled departure a full hour before
      bridge-parties had ever been known to break up, now grouped
      themselves together in Elizabeth's constructive mind. They
      fitted on to other facts that had hitherto seemed
      unrelated, but now were charged with significance. Georgie,
      for instance, had telephoned the day and the hour of this
      bridge-party to Lucia, he had accepted an invitation to
      something at a quarter to eight: he had promised to call
      for 'him' and 'her'. There could be no reasonable doubt
      that Lucia had purposely broken up Elizabeth's party at
      this early hour by bidding to dinner the seven guests who
      had just slunk away to dress . . . And her picture had been
      returned by the art committee, two of whom (though she did
      them the justice to admit that they were but the cat's-paws
      of a baleful intelligence) had hardly eaten any caviare
      sandwiches at all, for fear that they should not have good
      appetites for dinner. Hence also Diva's abstention from
      nougat chocolate, Major Benjy's from whisky, and the
      Padre's from shortbread. Nothing could be clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was far from feeling unhappy or deserted, and
      very very far from feeling beaten. Defiance and hatred
      warmed her blood most pleasantly, and she spent half an
      hour sitting by the window, thoroughly enjoying herself.
      She meant to wait here till twenty minutes to eight, and if
      by that time she had not seen the Royce turning the corner
      of Porpoise Street, and Georgie's car calling at the
      perfidious Major Benjy's house, she would be ready to go
      barefoot to Grebe, and beg Lucia's pardon for having
      attributed to her so devilish a device. But no such
      humiliating pilgrimage awaited her, for all happened
      exactly as she knew it would. The great glaring head-lights
      of the Royce blazed on the house opposite the turning to
      Porpoise Street, its raucous fog-horn sounded, and the
      porpoise car lurched into view scaring everybody by its
      lights and its odious voice, and by its size making
      foot-passengers flatten themselves against the walls.
      Hardly had it cleared the corner into the High Street when
      Georgie's gay bugle piped out and his car came under the
      window of the garden-room, and stopped at Major Benjy's.
      Elizabeth's intellect, unaided by any direct outside
      information, except that which she had overheard on the
      telephone, had penetrated this hole-and-corner business,
      and ringing the bell for her tray, she ate the large
      remainder of caviare sandwiches and nougat chocolate and
      fed her soul with schemes of reprisals. She could not
      off-hand think of any definite plan of sufficiently
      withering a nature, and presently, tired with mental
      activity, she fell into a fireside doze and had a happy
      dream that Dr Dobbie had popped in to tell her that Lucia
      had developed undoubted symptoms of leprosy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During the positively voluptuous week that followed
      Elizabeth's brief bridge-party, no fresh development
      occurred of the drama on which Tilling was concentrated,
      except that Lucia asked Elizabeth to tea and that Elizabeth
      refused. The rivals therefore did not meet, and neither of
      them seemed aware of the existence of the other. But both
      Grebe and Mallards had been inordinately gay; at Grebe
      there had been many lunches with bridge afterwards, and the
      guests on several occasions had hurried back for tea and
      more bridge at Mallards. Indeed, Tilling had never had so
      much lunch and tea in its life or enjoyed so brilliant a
      winter season, for Diva and the Wyses and Mrs Padre
      followed suit in lavish hospitality, and Georgie on one
      notable morning remembered that he had not had lunch or tea
      at home for five days; this was a record that beat
      Riseholme all to fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these gaieties there were celebrated the
      nuptials of Foljambe and Cadman, conducted from the bride's
      home, and the disposition of Foljambe's time between days
      with Georgie and nights with Cadman was working to
      admiration: everybody was pleased. At Grebe there had been
      other entertainments as well; the callisthenic class met on
      alternate days and Lucia in a tunic rather like Artemis,
      but with a supplementary skirt and scarlet stockings,
      headed a remarkable procession, consisting of Diva and the
      Wyses and Georgie and Major Benjy and the Padres and quaint
      Irene, out on to the cinder path of the kitchen-garden, and
      there they copied her jerks and flexings and whirlings of
      the arms and touchings of the toes to the great amazement
      of errand-boys who came legitimately to the kitchen-door,
      and others who peered through the hornbeam hedge. On wet
      days the athletes assembled in the kitchen with doors flung
      wide to the open air, and astonished the cook with their
      swimming movements, an arm and leg together, while they
      held on with the other hand to the great kitchen-table.
      '<i>Uno, due, tre,'</i> counted Lucia, and they all kicked
      out like frogs. And quaint Irene in her knickerbockers,
      sometimes stood on her head, but nobody else attempted
      that. Lucia played them soothing music as they rested
      afterwards in her drawing-room; she encouraged Major Benjy
      to learn his notes on the piano, for she would willingly
      teach him: she persuaded Susan to take up her singing
      again, and played <i>'La ci darem'</i> for her, while Susan
      sang it in a thin shrill voice, and Mr Wyse said
      '<i>Brava!</i> How I wish Amelia was here.' Sometimes Lucia
      read them Pope's translation of the <i>Iliad</i> as they
      drank their lemonade and Major Benjy his whisky and soda,
      and not content with these diversions (the wonderful
      creature) she was composing the address on modern art which
      she was to deliver at the opening of the exhibition on the
      day following Boxing Day. She made notes for it and then
      dictated to her secretary (Elizabeth Mapp's face was
      something awful to behold when Diva told her that Lucia had
      a secretary) who took down what she said on a typewriter.
      Indeed, Elizabeth's face had never been more awful when she
      heard that, except when Diva informed her that she was
      quite certain that Lucia would be delighted to let her join
      the callisthenic class.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though, during these days, no act of direct aggression
      like that of Lucia's dinner-party causing Elizabeth's
      bridge-party to break up had been committed on either side,
      it was generally believed that Elizabeth was not done for
      yet, and Tilling was on tiptoe, expectant of some 'view
      halloo' call to show that the chase was astir. She had
      refused Lucia's invitation to tea, and if she had been done
      for or gone to earth she would surely have accepted.
      Probably she took the view that the invitation was merely a
      test question to see how she was getting on, and her
      refusal showed that she was getting on very nicely. It
      would be absolutely unlike Elizabeth (to adopt a further
      metaphor) to throw up the sponge like that, for she had not
      yet been seriously hurt, and the bridge-party-round had
      certainly been won by Lucia; there would be fierce boxing
      in the next. It seemed likely that, in this absence of
      aggressive acts, both antagonists were waiting till the
      season of peace and good will was comfortably over and then
      they would begin again. Elizabeth would have a God-sent
      opportunity at the opening of the exhibition, when Lucia
      delivered her address. She could sit in the front row and
      pretend to go to sleep or suppress an obvious inclination
      to laugh. Tilling felt that she must have thought of that
      and of many other acts of reprisal unless she was no longer
      the Elizabeth they all knew and (within limits) respected,
      and (on numerous occasions) detested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasant custom of sending Christmas cards prevailed in
      Tilling, and most of the world met in the stationer's shop
      on Christmas Eve, selecting suitable salutations from the
      threepenny, the sixpenny and the shilling trays. Elizabeth
      came in rather early and had almost completed her purchases
      when some of her friends arrived, and she hung about
      looking at the backs of volumes in the lending-library, but
      keeping an eye on what they purchased. Diva, she observed,
      selected nothing from the shilling tray any more than she
      had herself; in fact, she thought that Diva's purchases
      this year were made entirely from the threepenny tray.
      Susan, on the other hand, ignored the threepenny tray and
      hovered between the sixpennies and the shillings and
      expressed an odiously opulent regret that there were not
      some 'choicer' cards to be obtained. The Padre and Mrs
      Bartlett were certainly exclusively threepenny, but that
      was always the case. However they, like everybody else,
      studied the other trays, so that when, next morning, they
      all received seasonable coloured greetings from their
      friends, a person must have a shocking memory if he did not
      know what had been the precise cost of all that were sent
      him. But Georgie and Lucia as was universally noticed,
      though without comment, had not been in at all, in spite of
      the fact that they had been seen about in the High Street
      together and going into other shops. Elizabeth therefore
      decided that they did not intend to send any Christmas
      cards and before paying for what she had chosen, she
      replaced in the threepenny tray a pretty picture of a robin
      sitting on a sprig of mistletoe which she had meant to send
      Georgie. There was no need to put back what she had chosen
      for Lucia, since the case did not arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Day dawned, a stormy morning with a strong gale
      from the south-west, and on Elizabeth's breakfast-table was
      a pile of letters, which she tore open. Most of them were
      threepenny Christmas cards, a sixpenny from Susan, smelling
      of musk, and none from Lucia or Georgie. She had
      anticipated that, and it was pleasant to think that she had
      put back into the threepenny tray the one she had selected
      for him, before purchasing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of her post was bills, some of which must be
      stoutly disputed when Christmas was over, and she found it
      difficult to realize the jollity appropriate to the day.
      Last evening various choirs of amateur riff-raffs and
      shrill bobtails had rendered the night hideous by
      repetitions of 'Good King Wenceslas' and the 'First Noel',
      church bells borne on squalls of wind and rain had awakened
      her while it was still dark and now sprigs of holly kept
      falling down from the picture-frames where Withers had
      perched them. Bacon made her feel rather better, and she
      went to church, with a mackintosh against these driving
      gusts of rain, and a slightly blue nose against this
      boisterous wind. Diva was coming to a dinner-lunch: this
      was an annual institution held at Wasters and Mallards
      alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth hurried out of church at the conclusion of the
      service by a side door, not feeling equal to joining in the
      gay group of her friends who with Lucia as their centre
      were gathered at the main entrance. The wind was stronger
      than ever, but the rain had ceased, and she battled her way
      round the square surrounding the church before she went
      home. Close to Mallards Cottage she met Georgie holding his
      hat on against the gale. He wished her a merry Christmas,
      but then his hat had been whisked off his head; something
      very strange happened to his hair, which seemed to have
      been blown off his skull, leaving a quite bare place there,
      and he vanished in frenzied pursuit of his hat with long
      tresses growing from the side of his head streaming in the
      wind. A violent draught eddying round the corner by the
      garden-room propelled her into Mallards holding on to the
      knocker, and it was with difficulty that she closed the
      door. On the table in the hall stood a substantial package,
      which had certainly not been there when she left. Within
      its wrappings was a <i>terrine</i> of <i>pâté de foie
      gras</i> with a most distinguished label on it, and a card
      fluttered on to the floor, proclaiming that wishes for a
      merry Christmas from Lucia and Georgie accompanied it.
      Elizabeth instantly conquered the feeble temptation of
      sending this gift back again in the manner in which she had
      returned that basket of tomatoes from her own garden.
      Tomatoes were not <i>pâté.</i> But what a treat for Diva!
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva arrived, and they went straight in to the banquet. The
      <i>terrine</i> was wrapped in a napkin, and Withers handed
      it to Diva. She helped herself handsomely to the truffles
      and the liver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How delicious!' she said. 'And such a monster!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope it's good,' said Elizabeth, not mentioning the
      donors. 'It ought to be. Paris.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva suddenly caught sight of a small label pasted below
      the distinguished one. It was that of the Tilling grocer,
      and a flood of light poured in upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucia and Mr Georgie have sent such lovely Christmas
      presents to everybody,' she said. 'I felt quite ashamed of
      myself for only having given them threepenny cards.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How sweet of them,' said Elizabeth. 'What were they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A beautiful box of hard chocolates for me,' said Diva.
      'And a great pot of caviare for Susan, and an umbrella for
      the Padre--his blew inside out in the wind
      yesterday--and--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And this beautiful <i>pâté</i> for me,' interrupted
      Elizabeth, grasping the nettle, for it was obvious that
      Diva had guessed. 'I was just going to tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva knew that was a lie, but it was no use telling
      Elizabeth so, because she knew it too, and she tactfully
      changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall have to do my exercises three times to-day after
      such a lovely lunch,' she said, as Elizabeth began slicing
      the turkey. But that was not a well-chosen topic, for
      subjects connected with Lucia might easily give rise to
      discord and she tried again and again and again, bumping,
      in her spinning-top manner, from one impediment to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Major Benjy can play the scale of C with his right
      hand'--(No, that wouldn't do). 'What an odd voice Susan's
      got: she sang an Italian song the other day at'--(Worse and
      worse). 'I sent two pictures to the winter
      exhibition'--(Worse if possible: there seemed to be no safe
      topic under the sun). 'A terrific gale, isn't it? There'll
      be three days of tremendous high tides for the wind is
      heaping them up. I should not wonder if the road by
      Grebe--' (she gave it up: it was no use)'--isn't flooded
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth behaved like a perfect lady. She saw that Diva
      was doing her best to keep off disagreeable subjects on
      Christmas Day, but there were really no others. All topics
      led to Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope not,' she said, 'for with all the field-paths
      soaked from the rain it is my regular walk just now. But
      not very likely, dear, for after the last time that the
      road was flooded, they built the bank opposite--opposite
      that house much higher.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked for quite a long while about gales and tides
      and dykes in complete tranquillity. Then the proletarian
      diversions of Boxing Day seemed safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a new film to-morrow at the Picture Palace about
      tadpoles,' said Elizabeth. 'So strange to think they become
      toads: or is it frogs? I think I must go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucia's giving a Christmas-tree for the choir-boys in the
      evening, in that great kitchen of hers,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How kind!' said Elizabeth hastily, to show she took no
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And in the afternoon there's a whist drive at the
      Institute,' said Diva. 'I'm letting both my servants go,
      and Lucia's sending all hers too. I'm not sure I should
      like to be quite alone in a house along that lonely road.
      We in the town could scream from a top window if burglars
      got into our houses and raise the alarm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be a very horrid burglar who was so wicked on
      Boxing Day,' observed Elizabeth sententiously. 'Ah, here's
      the plum pudding! Blazing beautifully, Withers! So pretty!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva became justifiably somnolent when lunch was over, and
      after half an hour's careful conversation she went off home
      to have a nice long nap, which she expressed by the word
      exercises. Elizabeth wrote two notes of gratitude to the
      donors of the <i>pâté</i> and sat herself down to think
      seriously of what she could do. She had refused Lucia's
      invitation to tea a few days before, thus declaring her
      attitude, and now it seemed to her that that was a mistake,
      for she had cut herself off from the opportunities of
      reprisals which intercourse with her might have provided.
      She had been unable, severed like this, to devise anything
      at all effective; all she could do was to lie awake at
      night hating Lucia, and this seemed to be quite barren of
      results. It might be better (though bitter) to join that
      callisthenic class in order to get a foot in the enemy's
      territory. Her note of thanks for the <i>pâté</i> would
      have paved the way towards such a step, and though it would
      certainly be eating humble pie to ask to join an affair
      that she had openly derided, it would be pie with a
      purpose. As it was, for a whole week she had had no
      opportunities, she had surrounded herself with a
      smoke-cloud, she heard nothing about Lucia any more, except
      when clumsy Diva let out things by accident. All she knew
      was that Lucia, busier than any bee known to science, was
      undoubtedly supreme in all the social activities which she
      herself had been accustomed to direct, and to remain, like
      Achilles in his tent, did not lead to anything. Also she
      had an idea that Tilling expected of her some exhibition of
      spirit and defiance, and no one was more anxious than she
      to fulfil those expectations to the utmost. So she settled
      she would go to Grebe to-morrow, and, after thanking her in
      person for the <i>pâté,</i> ask to join the callisthenic
      class. Tilling, and Lucia too, no doubt would take that as
      a sign of surrender, but let them wait a while, and they
      should see.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't fight her unless I get in touch with her,'
      reflected Elizabeth; 'at least I don't see how, and I'm
      sure I've thought enough.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of this policy Elizabeth set out early in the
      afternoon next day to walk out to Grebe, and there eat pie
      with a purpose. The streets were full of holiday folk, and
      by the railings at the end of the High Street, where the
      steep steps went down to the levels below, there was a
      crowd of people looking at the immense expanse of water
      that lay spread over the marsh. The south-westerly gale had
      piled up the spring tides, the continuous rains had caused
      the river to come down in flood, and the meeting of the
      two, the tide now being at its height, formed a huge lake,
      a mile and more wide, which stretched seawards. The gale
      had now quite ceased, the sun shone brilliantly from the
      pale blue of the winter sky, and this enormous estuary
      sparkled in the gleam. Far away to the south a great bank
      of very thick vapour lay over the horizon, showing that out
      in the Channel there was thick fog, but over Tilling and
      the flooded marsh the heavens overhead were of a dazzling
      radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of Elizabeth's friends were there, the Padre and his
      wife (who kept exclaiming in little squeaks, 'Oh dear me,
      what a quantity of water!'), the Wyses who had dismounted
      from the Royce, which stood waiting, to look at the great
      sight, before they proceeded on their afternoon drive.
      Major Benjy was saying that it was nothing to the Jumna in
      flood, but then he always held up India as being far ahead
      of England in every way (he had even once said on an
      extremely frosty morning, that this was nothing to the
      bitterness of Bombay): Georgie was there and Diva. With
      them all Elizabeth exchanged the friendliest greetings, and
      afterwards, when the great catastrophe had happened,
      everyone agreed that they had never known her more cordial
      and pleasant, poor thing. She did not of course tell them
      what her errand was, for it would be rash to do that till
      she saw how Lucia received her, but merely said that she
      was going for her usual brisk walk on this lovely
      afternoon, and should probably pop into the Picture Palace
      to learn about tadpoles. With many flutterings of her hand
      and enough au reservoirs to provide water for the world,
      she tripped down the hill, through the Landgate, and out on
      to the road that led to Grebe and nowhere else particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed, as she neared Grebe, Lucia's four indoor
      servants and Cadman coming into the town, and, remembering
      that they were going to a whist drive at the Institute,
      wished them a merry Christmas and hoped that they would all
      win. (Little kindly remarks like that always pleased
      servants, thought Elizabeth; they showed a human sympathy
      with their pleasures, and cost nothing; so much better than
      Christmas boxes.) Her brisk pace made short work of the
      distance, and within quite a few minutes of her leaving her
      friends, she had come to the thick hornbeam hedge which
      shielded Grebe from the road. She stopped opposite it for a
      moment: there was that prodigious sheet of dazzling water
      now close to the top of the restraining bank to admire:
      there was herself to screw up to the humility required for
      asking Lucia if she might join her silly callisthenic
      class. Finally, coming from nowhere, there flashed into her
      mind the thought of lobster <i>à la Riseholme,</i> the
      recipe for which Lucia had so meanly withheld from her.
      Instantly that thought fructified into apples of Desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave one glance at the hornbeam hedge to make sure that
      she was not visible from the windows of Grebe. (Lucia used
      often to be seen spying from the windows of the garden-room
      during her tenancy of Mallards, and she might be doing the
      same thing here.) But the hedge was quite impenetrable to
      human eye, as Elizabeth had often regretfully observed
      already, and now instead of going in at the high wooden
      gate which led to the front door, she passed quickly along
      till she came to the far corner of the hedge bordering the
      kitchen-garden. So swift was thought to a constructive mind
      like hers already stung with desire, that, brisk though was
      her physical movement, her mind easily outstripped it, and
      her plan was laid before she got to the corner. Viz.:
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants were all out--of that she had received ocular
      evidence but a few moments before--and the kitchen would
      certainly be empty. She would therefore go round to the
      gate at the end of the kitchen-garden and approach the
      house that way. The cinder path, used for the prancing of
      the callisthenic class in fine weather, led straight to the
      big coachhouse doors of the kitchen, and she would
      ascertain by the simple device of trying the handle if
      these were unlocked. If they were locked, there was an end
      to her scheme, but if they were unlocked, she would quietly
      pop in, and see whether the cook's book of recipes was not
      somewhere about. If it was she would surely find in it the
      recipe for lobster <i>à la Riseholme.</i> A few minutes
      would suffice to copy it, and then tiptoeing out of the
      kitchen again, with the key to the mystery in her pocket,
      she would go round to the front door as cool as a cucumber,
      and ring the bell. Should Lucia (alone in the house and
      possibly practising for more po-di-mus) not hear the bell,
      she would simply postpone the eating of her humble pie till
      the next day. If, by ill chance, Lucia was in the garden
      and saw her approaching by this unusual route, nothing was
      easier than to explain that, returning from her walk, she
      thought she would look in to thank her for the <i>pâté</i>
      and ask if she might join her callisthenic class. Knowing
      that the servants were all out (she would glibly explain)
      she felt sure that the main gate on to the road would be
      locked, and therefore she tried the back way . . . The
      whole formation of the scheme was instantaneous; it was as
      if she had switched on the lights at the door of a long
      gallery, and found it lit from end to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without hurrying at all she walked down the cinder path and
      tested the kitchen-door. It was unlocked, and she slipped
      in, closing it quietly behind her. In the centre of the
      kitchen, decked and ready for illumination, stood the
      Christmas-tree designed for the delectation of the
      choir-boys that evening, and the great kitchen-table, with
      its broad skirting of board half-way down the legs, had
      been moved away and stood on its side against the dresser
      in order to give more room for the tree. Elizabeth hardly
      paused a second to admire the tapers, the reflecting glass
      balls, the bright tinselly decorations, for she saw a small
      shelf of books on the wall opposite, and swooped like a
      merlin on it. There were a few trashy novels, there was a
      hymn-book and a prayer-book, and there was a thick volume,
      with no title on the back, bound in American cloth. She
      opened it and saw at once that her claws had at last
      gripped the prey, for on one page was pasted a cutting from
      the daily press concerning <i>oeufs à l'aurore,</i> on the
      next was a recipe in manuscript for cheese straws. Rapidly
      she turned the leaves, and there manifest at last was the
      pearl of great price, lobster <i>à la Riseholme.</i> It
      began with the luscious words, 'Take two hen lobsters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Out came her pencil; that and a piece of paper in which had
      been wrapped a present for a choir-boy was all she needed.
      In a couple of minutes she had copied out the mystic spell,
      replaced the sacred volume on its shelf, and put in her
      pocket the information for which she had pined so long.
      'How odd,' she cynically reflected, 'that only yesterday I
      should have said to Diva that it must be a very horrid
      burglar who was so wicked as to steal things on Boxing Day.
      Now I'll go round to the front door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when this Mephistophelian thought came into
      her mind, she heard with a sudden stoppage of her
      heart-beat, a step on the crisp path outside, and the
      handle of the kitchen-door was turned. Elizabeth took one
      sideways stride behind the gaudy tree and peering through
      its branches, saw Lucia standing at the entrance. Lucia
      came straight towards her, not yet perceiving that there
      was a Boxing Day burglar in her own kitchen, and stood
      admiring her tree. Then with a startled exclamation she
      called out, 'Who's that?' and Elizabeth knew that she was
      discovered. Further dodging behind the decorated fir would
      be both undignified and ineffectual, however skilful her
      footwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's me, dear Lucia,' she said. 'I came to thank you in
      person for that delicious <i>pàté</i> and to ask if--'
    </p>
    <p>
      From somewhere close outside there came a terrific roar and
      rush as of great water-floods released. Reunited for the
      moment by a startled curiosity, they ran together to the
      open door, and saw, already leaping across the road and
      over the hornbeam hedge, a solid wall of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The bank has given way,' cried Lucia. 'Quick, into the
      house through the door in the kitchen, and up the stairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They fled back past the Christmas-tree, and tried the door
      into the house. It was locked: the servants had evidently
      taken this precaution before going out on their pleasuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We shall be drowned,' wailed Elizabeth, as the flood came
      foaming into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rubbish,' cried Lucia. 'The kitchen-table! We must turn it
      upside down and get on to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but the work of a moment to do this, for the table
      was already on its side, and the two stepped over the high
      boarding that ran round it. Would their weight be too great
      to allow it to float on the rushing water that now deepened
      rapidly in the kitchen? That anxiety was short-lived, for
      it rose free from the floor and bumped gently into the
      Christmas-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must get out of this,' cried Lucia. 'One doesn't know
      how much the water will rise. We may be drowned yet if the
      table-legs come against the ceiling. Catch hold of the
      dresser and pull.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no need for such exertion, for the flood,
      eddying fiercely round the submerged kitchen, took them out
      of the doors that it had flung wide, and in a few minutes
      they were floating away over the garden and the hornbeam
      hedge. The tide had evidently begun to ebb before the bank
      gave way, and now the kitchen-table, occasionally turning
      round in an eddy, moved off in the direction of Tilling and
      of the sea. Luckily it had not got into the main stream of
      the river but floated smoothly and swiftly along, with the
      tide and the torrent of the flood to carry it. Its two
      occupants, of course, had no control whatever over its
      direction, but soon, with an upspring of hope, they saw
      that the current was carrying it straight towards the steep
      slope above the Landgate, where not more than a quarter of
      an hour ago Elizabeth had interchanged greetings and au
      reservoirs with her friends who had been looking at the
      widespread waters. Little had she thought that so soon she
      would be involved in literal reservoirs of the most
      gigantic sort--but this was no time for light conceits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company of Tillingites was still there when the bank
      opposite Grebe gave way. All but Georgie had heard the rush
      and roar of the released waters, but his eyes were sharper
      than others, and he had been the first to see where the
      disaster had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look, the bank opposite Grebe has burst!' he cried. 'The
      road's under water, her garden's under water: the rooms
      downstairs must be flooded. I hope Lucia's upstairs, or
      she'll get dreadfully wet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that road is Elizabeth's favourite walk,' cried Diva.
      'She'll be on it now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she walks so fast,' said the Padre, forgetting to
      speak Scotch. 'She'll be past Grebe by now, and above where
      the bank has burst.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh dear, oh dear, and on Boxing Day!' wailed Mrs Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge flood was fast advancing on the town, but with
      this outlet over the fields, it was evident that it would
      get no deeper at Grebe, and that, given Lucia was upstairs
      and that Elizabeth had walked as fast as usual, there was
      no real anxiety for them. All eyes now watched the progress
      of the water. It rose like a wave over a rock when it came
      to the railway line that crossed the marsh and in a couple
      of minutes more it was foaming over the fields immediately
      below the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Georgie uttered woe like Cassandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's something coming,' he cried. 'It looks like a raft
      with its legs in the air. And there are two people on it.
      Now it's spinning round and round; now it's coming straight
      here ever so fast. There are two women, one without a hat.
      It's Them! It's Lucia and Miss Mapp! What <i>has</i>
      happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The raft, with legs sometimes madly waltzing, sometimes
      floating smoothly along, was borne swiftly towards the
      bottom of the cliff, below which the flood was pouring by.
      The Padre, with his new umbrella, ran down the steps that
      led to the road below in order to hook it in, if it
      approached within umbrella-distance. On and on it came, now
      clearly recognizable as Lucia's great kitchen-table upside
      down, until it was within a yard or two of the bank. To
      attempt to wade out to it, for any effective purpose, was
      useless: the strongest would be swept away in such a
      headlong torrent, and even if he reached the raft there
      would be three helpless people on it instead of two and it
      would probably sink. To hook it with the umbrella was the
      only chance, for there was no time to get a boat-hook or a
      rope to throw out to the passengers. The Padre made a
      desperate lunge at it, slipped and fell flat into the
      water, and was only saved from being carried away by
      clutching at the iron railing alongside the lowest of the
      submerged steps. Then some fresh current tweaked the table
      and, still moving in the general direction of the
      flood-water, it sheered off across the fields. As it
      receded Lucia showed the real stuff of which she was made.
      She waved her hand and her clear voice rang out gaily
      across the waste of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Au reservoir, all of you,' she cried. 'We'll come back:
      just wait till we come back,' and she was seen to put her
      arm round the huddled form of Mapp, and comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen-table was observed by the watchers to get into
      the main channel of the river, where the water was swifter
      yet. It twirled round once or twice as if waving a
      farewell, and then shot off towards the sea and that great
      bank of thick mist which hung over the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not yet any reason to despair. A
      telephone-message was instantly sent to the fishermen at
      the port, another to the coast-guards, another to the
      lifeboat, that a kitchen-table with a cargo of ladies on it
      was coming rapidly down the river, and no effort must be
      spared to arrest its passage out to sea. But, one after the
      other, as the short winter afternoon waned, came
      discouraging messages from the coast. The flood had swept
      from their moorings all the fishing boats anchored at the
      port or drawn up on the shore above high-water mark, and a
      coast-guardsman had seen an unintelligible object go
      swiftly past the mouth of the river before the
      telephone-message was received. He could not distinguish
      what it was, for the fog out in the Channel had spread to
      the coastline, and it had seemed to him more like the heads
      and necks of four sea-serpents playing together than
      anything else. But when interrogated as to whether it might
      be the legs of a kitchen-table upside down he acknowledged
      that the short glimpse which he obtained of it before it
      got lost in the fog would suit a kitchen-table as well as
      sea-serpents. He had said sea-serpents because it was in
      the sea, but it was just as like the legs of a
      kitchen-table, which had never occurred to him as possible.
      His missus had just such a kitchen-table--but as he seemed
      to be diverging into domestic reminiscences, the Mayor of
      Tilling, who himself conducted inquiries instead of opening
      the whist drive at the Institute with a short speech on the
      sin of gambling, cut him off. It was only too clear that
      this imaginative naturalist had seen--too late--the
      kitchen-table going out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lifeboat had instantly responded to the SOS call on its
      services, and the great torrent of the flood having now
      gone by, the crew had been able to launch the boat and had
      set off to search the English Channel, in the blinding fog,
      for the table. The tide was setting west down the coast,
      the flood pouring out from the river mouth was discharged
      east, but they had gone off to row about in every
      direction, where the kitchen-table might have been carried.
      Rockets had been sent up from the station in case the
      ladies didn't know where they were. That, so the Mayor
      reflected, might conceivably show the ladies where they
      were, but it didn't really enable them to get anywhere
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk drew on and the friends of the missing went back to
      their respective houses, for there was no good in standing
      about in this dreadful cold fog which had now crept up from
      the marsh. Pneumonia wouldn't help matters. Four of them,
      Georgie and Major Benjy and Diva and quaint Irene, lived
      solitary and celibate, and the prospect of a lonely evening
      with only suspense and faint hopes to feed upon was
      perfectly ghastly. In consequence, when each of them in
      turn was rung up by Mr Wyse, who hoped, in a broken voice,
      that he might find them disengaged and willing to come
      round to his house for supper (not dinner), they all gladly
      accepted. Mr Wyse requested them not to dress as for
      dinner, and this was felt to show a great delicacy: not
      dressing would be a sort of symbol of their common anxiety.
      Supper would be at half-past eight, and Mr Wyse trusted
      that there would be encouraging news before that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre and Mrs Bartlett had been bidden as well, so that
      there was a supper-party of eight. Supper began with the
      most delicious caviare, and on the black oak mantelpiece
      were two threepenny Christmas cards. Susan helped herself
      plentifully to the caviare. There was no use in not eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Lucia's Christmas present to me,' she said. 'Hers and
      yours I should say, Mr Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lucia sent me a wonderful box of nougat chocolates,' said
      Diva. 'She and you, I mean, Mr Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy audibly gulped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs Lucia,' he said, 'if I may call her so, sent me half a
      dozen bottles of pre-war whisky.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre had pulled himself together by this time, and
      spoke Scotch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had a wee mischance wi' my umbrella two days agone,' he
      said, 'and Mistress Lucia, such a menseful woman, sent me a
      new one. An' now that's gone bobbin' out to sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're too pessimistic, Kenneth,' said Mrs Bartlett. 'An
      umbrella soon gets waterlogged and sinks, I tell you. The
      chances are it will be picked up in the marsh to-morrow,
      and it'll find its way back to you, for there's that
      beautiful silver band on the handle with your name engraved
      on it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eh, 'twould be a bonnie thing to recover it,' said her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse thought that the conversation was getting a little
      too much concerned with minor matters; the recovery of an
      umbrella, though new, was a loss that might be lamented
      later. Besides, the other missing lady had not been
      mentioned yet. He pointed to the two threepenny Christmas
      cards on the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our friend Elizabeth Mapp sent those to my wife and me
      yesterday,' he said. 'We shall keep them always among our
      most cherished possessions in case--I mean in any case.
      Pretty designs. Roofs covered with snow. Holly. Robins. She
      had a very fine artistic taste. Her pictures had always
      something striking and original about them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody cudgelled their brains for something appropriate
      to say about Elizabeth's connection with Art. The effort
      was quite hopeless, for her ignoble trick in rejecting
      Lucia's and Georgie's pictures for the last exhibition, and
      the rejection by the new committee of her own for the
      forthcoming exhibition were all that could occur to the
      most nimble brain, and while the artist was in direst peril
      on the sea, or possibly now at rest beneath it, it would be
      in the worst taste to recall those discordant incidents. A
      very long pause of silence followed, broken only by the
      crashing of toast in the mouths of those who had not yet
      finished their caviare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene had eaten no caviare, nor hitherto had she
      contributed anything to the conversation. Now she suddenly
      burst into shrieks of hysterical laughter and sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What rubbish you're all talking,' she cried, wiping her
      eyes. 'How can you be so silly? I'm sure I beg your
      pardons, but there it is. I'll go home, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She fled from the room and banged the front door so loudly
      that the house shook, and one of Miss Mapp's cards fell
      into the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor thing. Very excitable and uncontrolled,' said Susan.
      'But I think she's better alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general feeling of relief that Irene had gone,
      and as Mrs Wyse's excellent supper progressed, with its
      cold turkey and its fried slices of plum pudding, its
      toasted cheese and its figs stuffed with almonds sent by
      Amelia from Capri, the general numbness caused by the
      catastrophe began to pass off. Consumed with anxiety as all
      were for the two (especially one of them) who had vanished
      into the Channel fogs on so unusual a vehicle, they could
      not fail to recognize what problems of unparalleled
      perplexity and interest were involved in what all still
      hoped might not turn out to be a tragedy. But whether it
      proved so or not, the whole manner of these happenings, the
      cause, the conditions, the circumstances which led to the
      two unhappy ladies whisking by on the flood must be
      discussed, and presently Major Benjy broke into this
      unnatural reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've seen many floods on the Jumna,' he said, refilling
      his glass of port, 'but I never saw one so sudden and
      so--so fraught with enigmas. They must have been in the
      kitchen. Now we all know there was a Christmas-tree
      there--'
    </p>
    <p>
      A conversational flood equal to the largest ever seen on
      the Jumna was unloosed; a torrent of conjectures, and
      reconstruction after reconstruction of what could have
      occurred to produce what they had all seen, was examined
      and rejected as containing some inherent impossibility. And
      then what did the gallant Lucia's final words mean, when
      she said, 'Just wait till we come back'? By now discussion
      had become absolutely untrammelled, the rivalry between the
      two, Miss Mapp's tricks and pointless meannesses, Lucia's
      scornful victories, and, no less, her domineering ways were
      openly alluded to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But "Just wait till we come back" is what we're talking
      about,' cried Diva. 'We must keep to the point, Major
      Benjy. I believe she simply meant "Don't give up hope. We
      <i>shall</i> come back." And I'm sure they will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, there's more in it than that,' said Georgie,
      interrupting. 'I know Lucia better than any of you. She
      meant that she had something frightfully interesting to
      tell us when she did come back, as of course she will, and
      I'd bet it was something about Elizabeth. Some new thing
      she'd found her out in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But at such a solemn moment,' said the Padre, again
      forgetting his pseudo-Highland origin, 'when they were
      being whirled out to sea with death staring them in the
      face, I hardly think that such trivialities as those which
      had undoubtedly before caused between those dear ladies the
      frictions which we all deplored--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense, Kenneth,' said his wife, rather to his relief,
      for he did not know how he was to get out of this sentence,
      'you enjoyed those rows as much as anybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't agree with you, Padre,' said Georgie. 'To begin
      with, I'm sure Lucia didn't think she was facing death and
      even if she did, she'd still have been terribly interested
      in life till she went phut.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank God I live on a hill,' exclaimed Major Benjy,
      thinking, as usual, of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wyse held up his hand. As he was the host, it was only
      kind to give him a chance, for he had had none as yet.
      'Your pardon,' he said, 'if I may venture to suggest what
      may combine the ideas of our reverend friend and of Mr
      Pillson'--he made them two bows--'I think Mrs Lucas felt
      she was facing death--who wouldn't?--but she was of that
      vital quality which never gives up interest in life, until,
      in fact (which we trust with her is not the case), all is
      over. But like a true Christian, she was, as we all saw,
      employed in comforting the weak. She could not have been
      using her last moments, which we hope are nothing of the
      sort, better. And if there had been frictions, they arose
      only from the contact of two highly vitalized--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She kissed Elizabeth too,' cried Mrs Bartlett. 'I saw her.
      She hasn't done that for ages. Fancy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to get back to the kitchen,' said Diva. 'What could
      have taken Elizabeth to the kitchen? I've got a brilliant
      idea, though I don't know what you'll think of it. She knew
      Lucia was giving a Christmas-tree to the choir-boys,
      because I told her so yesterday--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder what's happened to that,' said the Padre. 'If it
      wasn't carried away by the flood, and I think we should
      have seen it go by, it might be dried.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva, as usual when interrupted, had held her mouth open,
      and went straight on.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--and she knew the servants were out, because I'd told her
      that too, and she very likely wanted to see the
      Christmas-tree. So I suggest that she went round the back
      way into the kitchen--that would be extremely like her, you
      know--in order to have a look at it, without asking a
      favour of--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I do call that clever,' interrupted Georgie
      admiringly. 'Go on. What happened next?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva had not got further than that yet, but now a blinding
      brilliance illuminated her and she clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see, I see,' she cried. 'In she went into the kitchen
      and while she was looking at it, Lucia came in too, and
      then the flood came in too. All three of them. That would
      explain what was behind her words, "Just wait till we come
      back." She meant that she wanted to tell us that she'd
      found Elizabeth in her kitchen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was universally felt that Diva had hit it, and after
      such a stroke of reconstructive genius, any further
      discussion must be bathos. Instantly a sad reaction set in,
      and they all looked at each other much shocked to find how
      wildly interested they had become in these trivial affairs,
      while their two friends were, to put the most hopeful view
      of the case, on a kitchen-table somewhere in the English
      Channel. But still Lucia had said that she and her
      companion were coming back, and though no news had arrived
      of the castaways, every one of her friends, at the bottom
      of their hearts, felt that these were not idle words, and
      that they must keep alive their confidence in Lucia. Miss
      Mapp alone would certainly have been drowned long ago, but
      Lucia, whose power of resource all knew to be unlimited,
      was with her. No one could suggest what she could possibly
      do in such difficult circumstances, but never yet had she
      been floored, nor failed to emerge triumphant from the most
      menacing situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Wyse's cuckoo clock struck the portentous hour of 1
      a.m. They all sighed, they all got up, they all said good
      night with melancholy faces, and groped their ways home in
      the cold fog. Above Georgie's head as he turned the corner
      by Mallards there loomed the gable of the garden-room,
      where so often a chink of welcoming light had shone between
      the curtains, as the sound of Mozartino came from within.
      Dark and full of suspense as was the present, he could
      still, without the sense of something forever past from his
      life, imagine himself sitting at the piano again with
      Lucia, waiting for her <i>Uno, due, TRE</i> as they tried
      over for the first time the secretly familiar duets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the next day this thick fog continued both on
      land and water, but no news came from seawards save the
      bleating and hooting of fog-horns, and as the hours passed,
      anxiety grew more acute. Mrs Wyse opened the picture
      exhibition on behalf of Lucia, for it was felt that in any
      case she would have wished that, but owing to the extreme
      inclemency of the weather only Mr Wyse and Georgie attended
      this inaugural ceremony. Mrs Wyse in the lamented absence
      of the authoress read Lucia's lecture on modern art from
      the typewritten copy which she had sent Georgie to look
      through and criticize. It lasted an hour and twenty
      minutes, and after Georgie's applause had died away at the
      end, Mr Wyse read the speech he had composed to propose a
      vote of thanks to Lucia for her most enthralling address.
      This also was rather long, but written in the most
      classical and urbane style. Georgie seconded this in a
      shorter speech, and Mrs Wyse <i>(vice</i> Lucia) read
      another longer speech of Lucia's which was appended in
      manuscript to her lecture, in which she thanked them for
      thanking her, and told them how diffident she had felt in
      thus appearing before them. There was more applause, and
      then the three of them wandered round the room and peered
      at each other's pictures through the dense fog. Evening
      drew in again, without news, and Tilling began to fear the
      worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning there came a mute and terrible message from
      the sea. The fog had cleared, the day was of crystalline
      brightness, and since air and exercise would be desirable
      after sitting at home all the day before, and drinking that
      wonderful pre-war whisky, Major Benjy set off by the eleven
      o'clock tram to play a round of golf with the Padre. Though
      hope was fast expiring, neither of them said anything
      definitely indicating that they no longer really expected
      to see their friends again, but there had been talk
      indirectly bearing on the catastrophe; the Major had asked
      casually whether Mallards was a freehold, and the Padre
      replied that both it and Grebe were the property of their
      occupiers and not held on lease; he also made a distant
      allusion to memorial services, saying he had been to one
      lately, very affecting. Then Major Benjy lost his temper
      with the caddie, and their game assumed a more normal
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now come to the eighth hole, the tee of which was
      perched high like a pulpit on the sand-dunes and overlooked
      the sea. The match was most exciting: hole after hole had
      been halved in brilliant sixes and sevens, the players were
      both on the top of their form, and in their keenness had
      quite banished from their minds the overshadowing anxiety.
      Here Major Benjy topped his ball into a clump of bents
      immediately in front of the tee, and when he had finished
      swearing at his caddie for moving on the stroke, the Padre
      put his iron shot on to the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A glorious day,' he exclaimed, and, turning to pick up his
      clubs, gazed out seawards. The tide was low, and an immense
      stretch of 'shining sands' as in Charles Kingsley's poem
      was spread in front of him. Then he gave a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?' he said to Major Benjy, pointing with a
      shaking finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good God,' said Major Benjy. 'Pick up my ball, caddie.'
      They scrambled down the steep dunes and walked across the
      sands to where lay this object which had attracted the
      Padre's attention. It was an immense kitchen-table upside
      down with its legs in the air, wet with brine but still in
      perfect condition. Without doubt it was the one which they
      had seen two days before whirling out to sea. But now it
      was by itself, no ladies were sitting upon it. The Padre
      bared his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we abandon our game, Major?' he said. 'We had better
      telephone from the Club-house to the Mayor. And I must
      arrange to get some men to bring the table back. It's far
      too heavy for us to think of moving it.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The news that the table had come ashore spread swiftly
      through Tilling, and Georgie, hearing that the Padre had
      directed that when it had passed the Custom House it should
      be brought to the Vicarage, went round there at once. It
      seemed almost unfeeling in this first shock of bereavement
      to think about tables, but it would save a great deal of
      bother afterwards to see to this now. The table surely
      belonged to Grebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I quite understand your point of view,' he said to the
      Padre, 'and of course what is found on the seashore in a
      general way belongs to the finder, if it's a few oranges in
      a basket, because nobody knows who the real owner is. But
      we all know, at least we're afraid we do, where this came
      from.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre was quite reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean it ought to go back to Grebe,' he said. 'Yes, I
      agree. Ah, I see it has arrived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the street, where a trolley, bearing the
      table, had just drawn up. Then a difficulty arose. It was
      late, and the bearers demurred to taking it all the way out
      to Grebe to-night and carrying it through the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Move it in here then for the night,' said the Padre. 'You
      can get it through the back-yard and into the outhouse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt himself bound to object to this: the table
      belonged to Grebe, and it looked as if Grebe, alas,
      belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it had better come to Mallards Cottage,' said he
      firmly. 'It's only just round the corner, and it can stand
      in my yard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Padre was quite willing that it should go back to
      Grebe, but why should Georgie claim this object with all
      the painful interest attached to it? After all, he had
      found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so I don't quite see why you should have it,' he said
      a little stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie took him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's dreadful to talk about it so soon,' he said, 'but
      that is what I should like done with it. You see Lucia left
      me Grebe and all its contents. I still cling--can't help
      it--to the hope that neither it nor they may ever be mine,
      but in the interval which may elapse--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! Really!' said the Padre with a sudden thrill of
      Tillingite interest which it was no use trying to suppress.
      'I congrat--Well, well. Of course the kitchen-table is
      yours. Very proper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The trolley started again and by dint of wheedlings and
      cunning coaxings the sad substantial relic was induced to
      enter the back-yard of Mallards Cottage. Here for the
      present it would have to remain, but pickled as it was with
      long immersion in sea water, the open air could not
      possibly hurt it, and if it rained, so much the better, for
      it would wash the salt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, very tired and haggard with these harrowing
      arrangements, had a little rest on his sofa, when he had
      seen the table safely bestowed. His cook gave him a
      succulent and most nutritious dinner by way of showing her
      sympathy, and Foljambe waited on him with peculiar
      attention, constantly holding a pocket-handkerchief to the
      end of her nose, by way of expressing her own grief.
      Afterwards he moved to his sitting-room and took up his
      needlework, that 'sad narcotic exercise', and looked his
      loss in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was difficult to imagine what life would be like
      without Lucia, but there was no need to imagine it, for he
      was experiencing it already. There was nothing to look
      forward to, and he realized how completely Lucia and her
      manoeuvres and her indomitable vitality and her deceptions
      and her greatnesses had supplied the salt to life. He had
      never been in the least in love with her, but somehow she
      had been as absorbing as any wayward and entrancing
      mistress. 'It will be too dull for anything,' thought he,
      'and there won't be a single day in which I shan't miss her
      most dreadfully. It's always been like that: when she was
      away from Riseholme, I never seemed to care to paint or to
      play, except because I should show her what I had done when
      she came back, and now she'll never come back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He abandoned himself for quite a long time to despair with
      regard to what life would hold for him. Nobody else, not
      even Foljambe, seemed to matter at all. But then through
      the black, deep waters of his tribulation there began to
      appear little bubbles on the surface. It was like comparing
      a firefly with the huge night itself to weigh them against
      this all-encompassing darkness, but where for a moment each
      pricked the surface there was, it was idle to deny, just a
      spark that stood out momentarily against the blackness. The
      table, for instance: he would have a tablet fixed on to it,
      with a suitable inscription to record the tragic role it
      had played, a text, so to speak, as on a cenotaph. How
      would Lucia's last words do? 'Just wait till we come back.'
      But if this was a memorial table, it must record that Lucia
      was not coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fetched a writing-pad and began again. 'This is the
      table--' but that wouldn't do. It suggested 'This is the
      house that Jack built.' Then, 'It was upon this table on
      Boxing Day afternoon, 1930, that Mrs Emmeline Lucas, of
      Grebe, and Miss Elizabeth Mapp, of Mallards--' that was too
      prolix. Then, 'In memory of Emmeline Lucas and Elizabeth
      Mapp. They went to sea--' but that sounded like a nursery
      rhyme by Edward Lear, or it might suggest to future
      generations that they were sailors. Then he wondered if
      poetry would supply anything, and the lines, 'And may there
      be no sadness of farewell, when I embark,' occurred to him.
      But that wouldn't do: people would wonder why she had
      embarked on a kitchen-table, and even now, when the event
      was so lamentably recent, nobody actually knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hadn't any idea,' thought Georgie, 'how difficult it is
      to write a few well-chosen and heart-felt words. I shall go
      and look at the tombstones in the churchyard to-morrow.
      Lucia would have thought of something perfect at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiny as were these bubbles and others (larger ones) which
      Georgie refused to look at directly, they made a momentary,
      an evanescent brightness. Some of them made quite loud pops
      as they burst, and some presented problems. This
      catastrophe had conveyed a solemn warning against living in
      a house so low-lying, and Major Benjy had already expressed
      that sentiment when he gave vent to that self-centred
      <i>cri du coeur</i> 'Thank God I live on a hill,' but for
      Georgie that question would soon become a practical one,
      though he would not attempt to make up his mind yet. It
      would be absurd to have two houses in Tilling, to be the
      tenant of Mallards Cottage, and the owner of Grebe. Or
      should he live in Grebe during the summer, when there was
      no fear of floods, and Mallards Cottage in the winter?
    </p>
    <p>
      He got into bed: the sympathetic Foljambe, before going
      home, had made a beautiful fire, and his hot-water bottle
      was of such a temperature that he could not put his feet on
      it at all . . . If he lived at Grebe she would only have to
      go back across the garden to her Cadman, if Cadman remained
      in his service. Then there was Lucia's big car. He supposed
      that would be included in the contents of Grebe. Then he
      must remember to put a black bow on Lucia's picture in the
      Art Exhibition. Then he got sleepy . . .

    </p>
    <p>
      Though Georgie had thought that there would be nothing
      interesting left in life now that Lucia was gone, and
      though Tilling generally was conscious that the termination
      of the late rivalries would take all thrill out of
      existence as well as eclipsing its gaieties most
      dreadfully, it proved one morning when the sad days had
      begun to add themselves into weeks, that there was a great
      deal for him to do, as well as a great deal for Tilling to
      talk about. Lucia had employed a local lawyer over the
      making of her will, and to-day Mr Causton <i>(re</i> the
      affairs of Mrs Emmeline Lucas) came to see Georgie about
      it. He explained to him with a manner subtly compounded of
      sympathy and congratulation that the little sum of money to
      which Lucia had alluded was no less than £80,000. Georgie
      was, in fact, apart from certain legacies, her heir. He was
      much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too kind of her,' he said. 'I had no idea--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Causton went on with great delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be some months,' he said, 'before in the absence
      of fresh evidence, the death of my client can be legally
      assumed--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, the longer, the better,' said Georgie rather vaguely,
      wiping his eyes, 'but what do you mean about fresh
      evidence?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The recovery, by washing ashore or other identification,
      of the lamented corpses,' said Mr Causton. 'In the interval
      the--the possibly late Mrs Lucas has left no provision for
      the contingency we have to face. If and when her death is
      proved, the staff of servants will receive their wages up
      to date and a month's notice. Until then the estate, I take
      it, will be liable for the out-goings and the upkeep of
      Grebe. I would see to all that, but I felt that I must get
      your authority first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, naturally,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But here a difficulty arises,' said Mr Causton. 'I have no
      authority for drawing on the late--or, we hope, the present
      Mrs Lucas's balance at the bank. There is, you see, no fund
      out of which the current expenses of the upkeep of the
      house can be paid. There is more than a month's food and
      wages for her servants already owing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      George's face changed a little. A very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had better pay them myself,' he said. 'Would not that be
      the proper course?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think, under the circumstances, that it would,' said Mr
      Causton. 'In fact, I don't see what else is to be done,
      unless all the servants were discharged at once, and the
      house shut up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, that would never do,' said Georgie. 'I must go down
      there and arrange about it all. If Mrs Lucas returns, how
      horrid for her to find all her servants who had been with
      her so long, gone. Everything must carry on as if she had
      only gone for a visit somewhere and forgotten to send a
      cheque for expenses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then, at any rate, was something to do already, and
      Georgie, thinking that he would like a little walk on this
      brisk morning, and also feeling sure that he would like a
      little conversation with friends in the High Street, put on
      his thinner cape, for a hint of spring was in the air, and
      there were snowdrops abloom in the flower-border of his
      little garden. Lucia, he remembered, always detested
      snowdrops: they hung their heads and were feeble; they
      typified for her slack though amiable inefficiency. In
      order to traverse the whole length of the High Street and
      get as many conversations as possible he went down by
      Mallards and Major Benjy's house. The latter, from the
      window of his study, where he so often enjoyed a rest or a
      little refreshment before and after his game of golf, saw
      him pass, and beckoned him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good morning, old boy,' he said. 'I've had a tremendous
      slice of luck: at least that is not quite the way to put
      it, but what I mean is--In fact, I've just had a visit from
      the solicitor of our lamented friend Elizabeth Mapp, God
      bless her, and he told me the most surprising news. I was
      monstrously touched by it: hadn't a notion of it, I assure
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't mean to say,' began Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes I do. He informed me of the provisions of that dear
      woman's will. In memory of our long friendship, these were
      the very words--and I assure you I was not ashamed to turn
      away and wipe my eyes, when he told me--in memory of our
      long friendship she has left me that beautiful Mallards and
      the sum of ten thousand pounds, which I understand was the
      bulk of her fortune. What do you think of that?' he asked,
      allowing his exultation to get the better of him for the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Georgie, 'I congratulate--at least in case--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know,' said Major Benjy. 'If it turns out to be too true
      that our friends have gone for ever, you're friendly enough
      to be glad that what I've told you is too true, too. Eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite, and I've had a visit from Mr Causton,' said
      Georgie, unable to contain himself any longer, 'and Lucia's
      left me Grebe and eighty thousand pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My word! What a monstrous fortune,' cried the Major with a
      spasm of chagrin. 'I congrat--Anyhow, the same to you. I
      shall get a motor instead of going to my golf on that
      measly tram. Then there's Mallards for me to arrange about.
      I'm thinking of letting it furnished, servants and all.
      It'll be snapped up at ten guineas a week. Why, she got
      fifteen last summer from the other poor corpse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't,' said Georgie. 'Supposing she came back and
      found she couldn't get into her house for another month
      because you had let it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'God grant she may come back,' said the Major, without
      falling dead on the spot. 'But I see your point: it would
      be awkward. I'll think it over. Anyhow, of course, after a
      proper interval, when the tragedy is proved, I shall go and
      live there myself. Till then I shall certainly pay the
      servants' wages and the upkeep. Rather a drain, but it
      can't be helped. Board wages of twelve shillings a week is
      what I shall give them: they'll live like fighting cocks on
      that. By jove, when I think of that terrible sight of the
      kitchen-table lying out there on the beach, it causes me
      such a sinking still. Have a drink: wonderful pre-war
      whisky.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had not yet visited Grebe, and he found a thrilling
      though melancholy interest in seeing the starting-point of
      the catastrophe. The Christmas-tree, he ascertained, had
      stuck in the door of the kitchen, and the Padre had already
      been down to look at it, but had decided that the damage to
      it was irreparable. It was lying now in the garden from
      which soil and plants had been swept away by the flood, but
      Georgie could not bear to see it there, and directed that
      it should be put up, as a relic, in an empty outhouse.
      Perhaps a tablet on that as well as on the table. Then he
      had to interview Grosvenor, and make out a schedule of the
      servants' wages, the total of which rather astonished him.
      He saw the cook and told her that he had the kitchen-table
      in his yard, but she begged him not to send it back, as it
      had always been most inconvenient. Mrs Lucas, she told him,
      had had a feeling for it; she thought there was luck about
      it. Then she burst into tears and said it hadn't brought
      her mistress much luck after all. This was all dreadfully
      affecting, and Georgie told her that in this period of
      waiting during which they must not give up hope, all their
      wages would be paid as usual, and they must carry on as
      before, and keep the house in order. Then there were some
      unpaid bills of Lucia's, a rather appalling total, which
      must be discharged before long, and the kitchen must be
      renovated from the effects of the flood. It was after dark
      when he got back to Mallards Cottage again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of what Mr Causton called further evidence
      in the way of corpses, and of alibis in the way of living
      human bodies, the Padre settled in the course of the next
      week to hold a memorial service, for unless one was held
      soon, they would all have got used to the bereavement, and
      the service would lose point and poignancy. It was
      obviously suitable that Major Benjy and Georgie, being the
      contingent heirs of the defunct ladies, should sit by
      themselves in a front pew as chief mourners, and Major
      Benjy ordered a black suit to be made for him without delay
      for use on this solemn occasion. The church bell was tolled
      as if for a funeral service, and the two walked in side by
      side after the rest of the congregation had assembled, and
      took their places in a pew by themselves immediately in
      front of the reading-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service was of the usual character, and the Padre gave
      a most touching address on the text 'They were lovely and
      pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not
      divided.' He reminded his hearers how the two whom they
      mourned were as sisters, taking the lead in social
      activities, and dispensing to all who knew them their
      bountiful hospitalities. Their lives had been full of
      lovable energy. They had been at the forefront in all
      artistic and literary pursuits: indeed he might almost have
      taken the whole of the verse of which he had read them only
      the half as his text, and have added that they were swifter
      than eagles, they were stronger than lions. One of them had
      been known to them all for many years, and the name of
      Elizabeth Mapp was written on their hearts. The other was a
      newer comer, but she had wonderfully endeared herself to
      them in her briefer sojourn here, and it was typical of her
      beautiful nature that on the very day on which the disaster
      occurred, she had been busy with a Christmas-tree for the
      choristers in whom she took so profound an interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the last sad scene, he need not say much about
      it, for never would any of them forget that touching, that
      ennobling, that teaching sight of the two, gallant in the
      face of death as they had ever been in that of life, being
      whirled out to sea. Mrs Lucas in the ordeal which they
      would all have to face one day, giving that humorous
      greeting of hers, 'au reservoir', which they all knew so
      well, to her friends standing in safety on the shore, and
      then turning again to her womanly work of comforting and
      encouraging her weaker sister. 'May we all,' said the
      Padre, with a voice trembling with emotion, 'go to meet
      death in that serene and untroubled spirit, doing our duty
      to the last. And now--'
    </p>
    <p>
      This sermon, at the request of a few friends, he had
      printed in the Parish Magazine next week, and copies were
      sent to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was only natural that Tilling should feel relieved when
      the ceremony was over, for the weeks since the stranding of
      the kitchen-table had been like the period between a death
      and a funeral. The blinds were up again now, and life
      gradually resumed a more normal complexion. January ebbed
      away into February, February into March, and as the days
      lengthened with the returning sun, so the mirths and
      squabbles of Tilling grew longer and brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a certain stimulus which had enlivened them all since
      Lucia's advent from Riseholme was lacking. It was not
      wholly that there was no Lucia, nor, wholly, that there was
      no Elizabeth, it was the intense reactions which they had
      produced together that everyone missed so fearfully. Day
      after day those who were left met and talked in the High
      Street, but never was there news of that thrilling kind
      which since the summer had keyed existence up to so
      exciting a level. But it was interesting to see Major Benjy
      in his new motor, which he drove himself, and watch his
      hairbreadth escapes from collisions at sharp corners and to
      hear the appalling explosions of military language if any
      other vehicle came within a yard of his green bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He seems to think,' said Diva to Mrs Bartlett, as they met
      on shopping errands one morning, 'that now he has got a
      motor nobody else may use the road at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A trumpery little car,' said Mrs Bartlett, 'I should have
      thought, with ten thousand pounds as good as in his pocket,
      he might have got himself something better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing at the corner looking up towards
      Mallards, and Diva suddenly caught sight of a board on
      Major Benjy's house, announcing that it was for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, whatever's that?' she cried. 'That must have been put
      up only to-day. Good morning, Mr Georgie. What about Major
      Benjy's house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie still wore a broad black band on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, he told me yesterday that he was going to move into
      Mallards next week,' he said. 'And he's going to have a
      sale of his furniture almost immediately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That won't be much to write home about,' said Diva
      scornfully. 'A few moth-eaten tiger-skins which he said he
      shot in India.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think he wants some money,' said Georgie. 'He's bought a
      motor, you see, and he has to keep up Mallards as well as
      his own house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I call that very rash,' said Mrs Bartlett. 'I call that
      counting your chickens before they're hatched. Oh dear me,
      what a thing to have said! Dreadful!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie tactfully covered this up by a change of subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've made up my mind,' he said, 'and I'm going to put up a
      cenotaph in the churchyard to dear Lucia and Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What? Both?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I've thought it carefully over, and it's going to be
      both.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Major Benjy ought to go halves with you then,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I told him I was intending to do it,' said Georgie,
      'and he didn't catch on. He only said "Capital idea," and
      took some whisky and soda. So I shan't say any more. I
      would really just as soon do it all myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I do think that's mean of him,' said Diva. 'He ought
      anyhow to bear some part of the expense, considering
      everything. Instead of which he buys a motor-car which he
      can't drive. Go on about the cenotaph.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw it down at the stonemason's yard,' said Georgie,
      'and that put the idea into my head. Beautiful white marble
      on the lines, though of course much smaller, of the one in
      London. It had been ordered, I found, as a tombstone, but
      then the man who ordered it went bankrupt, and it was on
      the stonemason's hands.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've heard about it,' said Mrs Bartlett, in rather a
      superior voice. 'Kenneth told me you'd told him, and we
      both think that it's a lovely idea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The stonemason ought to let you have it cheap then,' said
      Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It wasn't very cheap,' said Georgie, 'but I've bought it,
      and they'll put it in its place to-day, just outside the
      south transept, and the Padre is going to dedicate it. Then
      there's the inscription. I shall have in loving memory of
      them, by me, and a bit of the Padre's text at the memorial
      service. Just "In death they were not divided."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite right. Don't put in about the eagles and the lions,'
      said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I thought I would leave that out. Though I like that
      part,' said Georgie for the sake of Mrs Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Talking of whisky,' said Diva, flying back, as her manner
      was, to a remote allusion, 'Major Benjy's finished all the
      pre-war whisky that Lucia gave him. At least I heard him
      ordering some more yesterday. Oh, and there's the notice of
      his sale. Old English furniture--yes, that may mean two
      things, and I know which of them it is. Valuable works of
      Art. Well I never! A print of the "Monarch of the Glen" and
      a photograph of the "Soul's Awakening". Rubbish! Fine
      tiger-skins! The skins may be all right, but they're bald.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, how severe you are,' said Georgie. 'Now I must go
      and see how they're getting on with the inscription. Au
      reservoir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva nodded at Evie Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nice to hear that again,' she said. 'I've not heard
      it--well, since.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cenotaph with its inscription in bold leaded letters to
      say that Georgie had erected it in memory of the two
      undivided ladies, roused much admiration, and a full-page
      reproduction of it appeared in the Parish Magazine for
      April, which appeared on the last day of March. The
      stone-cutter had slightly miscalculated the space at his
      disposal for the inscription, and the words 'Elizabeth
      Mapp' were considerably smaller than the words 'Emmeline
      Lucas' in order to get them into the line. Though Tilling
      said nothing about that, it was felt that the error was
      productive of a very suitable effect, if a symbolic meaning
      was interpreted into it. Georgie was considered to have
      done it very handsomely and to be behaving in a way that
      contrasted most favourably with the conduct of Major Benjy,
      for whereas Georgie was keeping up Grebe at great expense,
      and restoring, all at his own charge, the havoc the flood
      had wrought in the garden, Major Benjy, after
      unsuccessfully trying to let Mallards at ten guineas a
      week, had moved into the house, and, with a precipitation
      that was as rash as it was indelicate, was already
      negotiating about the disposal of his own, and was to have
      a sale of his furniture on April the first. He had bought a
      motor, he had replenished the cellars of Mallards with
      strong wines and more pre-war whisky, he was spending money
      like water and on the evening of this last day of March he
      gave a bridge-party in the garden-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie and Diva and Mrs Padre were the guests at this
      party: there had been dinner first, a rich elaborate
      dinner, and bridge afterwards up till midnight. It had been
      an uncomfortable evening, and before it was over they all
      wished they had not come, for Major Benjy had alluded to it
      as a house-warming, which showed that either his memory was
      going, or that his was a very callous nature, for no one
      whose perceptions were not of the commonest could possibly
      have used that word so soon. He had spoken of his
      benefactress with fulsome warmth, but it was painfully
      evident from what source this posthumous affection sprang.
      He thought of having the garden-room redecorated, the house
      wanted brightening up a bit, he even offered each of them
      one of Miss Mapp's water-colour sketches, of which was a
      profusion on the walls, as a memento of their friend, God
      bless her . . . There he was straddling in the doorway with
      the air of a vulgar <i>nouveau riche</i> owner of an
      ancestral property, as they went their ways homeward into
      the night, and they heard him bolt and lock the door and
      put up the chain which Lucia in her tenancy had had
      repaired in order to keep out the uninvited and informal
      visits of Miss Mapp. 'It would serve him jolly well right,'
      thought Georgie, 'if she came back.'

    </p>
    <p>
      It was a calm and beautiful night with a high tide that
      overflowed the channel of the river. There was spread a
      great sheet of moonlit water over the submerged meadows at
      the margin, and it came up to the foot of the rebuilt bank
      opposite Grebe. Between four and five of the morning of
      April the first, a trawler entered the mouth of the river,
      and just at the time when the stars were growing pale and
      the sky growing red with the coming dawn, it drew up at the
      little quay to the east of the town, and was moored to the
      shore. There stepped out of it two figures clad in overalls
      and tarpaulin jackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think we had better go straight to Mallards, dear,' said
      Elizabeth, 'as it's so close, and have a nice cup of tea to
      warm ourselves. Then you can telephone from there to Grebe,
      and tell them to send the motor up for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall ring up Georgie too,' said Lucia. 'I can't bear to
      think that his suspense should last a minute more than is
      necessary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth pointed upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'See, there's the sun catching the top of the church
      tower,' she said. 'Little did I think I should ever see
      dear Tilling again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never had the slightest doubt about it,' said Lucia.
      'Look, there are the fields we floated across on the
      kitchen-table. I wonder what happened to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed the steps at the south-east angle of the town,
      and up the slope to the path across the churchyard. This
      path led close by the south side of the church, and the
      white marble of the cenotaph gleamed in the early sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a handsome tomb,' said Elizabeth. 'It's quite new.
      But how does it come here? No one has been buried in the
      churchyard for a hundred years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a gasp as the polished lead letters caught her
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's us!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood side by side in their tarpaulins, and together
      in a sort of chant read the inscription aloud.

      'I've never heard of such a thing,' cried Lucia. 'I call it
      most premature of Georgie, assuming that I was dead like
      that. The inscription must be removed instantly. All the
      same it was kind of him and what a lot of money it must
      have cost him! Gracious me, I suppose he thought--Let us
      hurry, Elizabeth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was still staring at the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am puzzled to know why my name is put in such
      exceedingly small letters,' she said acidly. 'You can
      hardly read it. As you say, dear, it was most premature of
      him. I should call it impertinent, and I'm very glad dear
      Major Benjy had nothing to do with it. There's an
      indelicacy about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went quickly on past Mallards Cottage where the blinds
      were still down, and there was the window of the
      garden-room from which each had made so many thrilling
      observations, and the red-brick front, glowing in the
      sun-light, of Mallards itself. As they crossed the cobbled
      way to the front door, Elizabeth looked down towards the
      High Street and saw on Major Benjy's house next door the
      house-agents' board announcing that the freehold of this
      desirable residence was for disposal. There were bills
      pasted on the walls announcing the sale of furniture to
      take place there that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face turned white, and she laid a quaking hand on
      Lucia's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look, Major Benjy's house is for sale,' she faltered. 'Oh,
      Lucia, what has happened? Have we come back from the dead,
      as it were, to find that it's our dear old friend instead?
      And to think--' She could not complete the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dear, you mustn't jump at any such terrible
      conclusions,' said Lucia. 'He may, have changed his
      house--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth shook her head; she was determined to believe the
      worst, and indeed it seemed most unlikely that Major Benjy
      who had lived in the same house for a full quarter of a
      century could have gone to any new abode but one. Meantime,
      eager to put an end to this suspense, Elizabeth kept
      pressing the bell, and Lucia plying the knocker of
      Mallards.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They all sleep on the attic floor,' said Elizabeth, 'but I
      think they must hear us soon if we go on. Ah, there's a
      step on the stairs. Someone is coming down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the numerous bolts on the door shot back, they
      heard the rattle of the released chain. The door was opened
      and there within stood Major Benjy. He had put on his
      dinner jacket over his Jaeger pyjamas, and had carpet
      slippers on his feet. He was sleepy and bristly and very
      cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now what's all this about, my men,' he said, seeing two
      tarpaulined figures on the threshold. 'What do you mean by
      waking me up with that infernal--'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth's suspense was quite over.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You wretch,' she cried in a fury. 'What do <i>you</i>
      mean? Why are you in my house? Ah, I guess! He! He! He! You
      learned about my will, did you? You thought you wouldn't
      wait to step into a dead woman's shoes, but positively tear
      them off my living feet. My will shall be revoked this day:
      I promise you that . . . Now out you go, you horrid
      supplanter! Off to your own house with you, for you shan't
      spend another minute in mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this impassioned address Major Benjy's face changed
      to an expression of the blankest dismay, as if he had seen
      something much worse (as indeed he had) than a ghost. He
      pulled pieces of himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, my dear Miss Elizabeth,' he said. 'You'll allow me
      surely, to get my clothes on, and above all to say one word
      of my deep thankfulness that you and Mrs Lucas--it is Mrs
      Lucas, isn't it?--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get out!' said Elizabeth, stamping her foot. 'Thankfulness
      indeed! There's a lot of thankfulness in your face! Go
      away! Shoo!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Benjy had faced wounded tigers (so he said) in India,
      but then he had a rifle in his hand. He could not face his
      benefactress, and, with first one slipper and then the
      other dropping off his feet, he hurried down the few yards
      of pavement to his own house. The two ladies entered:
      Elizabeth banged the door and put up the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So that's that,' she observed (and undoubtedly it was).
      'Ah, here's Withers. Withers, we've come back, and though
      you ought never to have let the Major set foot in my house,
      I don't blame you, for I feel sure he bullied you into it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, miss!' said Withers. 'Is it you? Fancy! Well, that is
      a surprise!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now get Mrs Lucas and me a cup of tea,' said Elizabeth,
      'and then she's going back to Grebe. That wretch hasn't
      been sleeping in my room, I trust?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, in the best spare bedroom,' said Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then get my room ready, and I shall go to bed for a few
      hours. We've been up all night. Then, Withers, take all
      Major Benjy's clothes and his horrid pipes, and all that
      belongs to him, and put them on the steps outside. Ring him
      up, and tell him where he will find them. But not one foot
      shall he set in <i>my</i> house again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia went to the telephone and rang up Cadman's cottage
      for her motor. She heard his exclamation of 'My Gawd', she
      heard (what she supposed was) Foljambe's cry of
      astonishment, and then she rang up Georgie. He and his
      household were all a-bed and asleep when the telephone
      began its summons, but presently the persistent tinkle
      penetrated into his consciousness, and made him dream that
      he was again watching Lucia whirling down the flood on the
      kitchen-table and ringing an enormous dinner-bell as she
      swept by the steps. Then he became completely awake and
      knew it was only the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The tarsome thing!' he muttered. 'Who on earth can it be
      ringing one up at this time? Go on ringing then till you're
      tired. I shall go to sleep again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of these resolutions, he did nothing of the kind.
      So ceaseless was the summons that in a minute or two he got
      out of bed, and putting on his striped dressing-gown (blue
      and yellow) went down to his sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Who is it? What do you want?' he said crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a little merry laugh, and then a voice, which he
      had thought was silent for ever, spoke in unmistakable
      accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie! <i>Georgino mio!'</i> it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What? What?' he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it's Lucia,' said the voice. 'Me's tum home,
      Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighty thousand pounds (less death duties) and Grebe seemed
      to sweep by him like an avalanche, and fall into the gulf
      of the things that might have been. But it was not the cold
      blast of that ruin that filled his eyes with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh my dear!' he cried. 'Is it really you? Lucia, where are
      you? Where are you talking from?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mallards. Elizabeth and I--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What, both of you?' called Georgie. 'Then--where's Major
      Benjy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just gone home,' said Lucia discreetly. 'And as soon as
      I've had a cup of tea I'm going to Grebe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I must come round and see you at once,' said Georgie.
      'I'll just put some things on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, do,' said Lucia. 'Presto, presto, Georgie.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Careless of his reputation for being the best-dressed man
      in Tilling, he put on his dress trousers and a pullover,
      and his thick brown cape, and did not bother about his
      <i>toupet.</i> The front door of Mallards was open, and
      Elizabeth's servants were laying out on the top step a
      curious collection of golf-clubs and tooth-brushes and
      clothes. From mere habit--everyone in Tilling had the
      habit--he looked up at the window of the garden-room as he
      passed below it, and was astonished to see two mariners in
      sou'wester caps and tarpaulin jackets kissing their hands
      to him. He had only just time to wonder who these could
      possibly be when he guessed. He flew into Lucia's arms,
      then wondered if he ought to kiss Elizabeth too. But there
      was a slight reserve about her which caused him to refrain.
      He was not brilliant enough at so early an hour to guess
      that she had seen the smaller lettering in which her loving
      memory was recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but time for a few ejaculations and a promise
      from Georgie to dine at Grebe that night, before Lucia's
      motor arrived, and the imperturbable Cadman touched his cap
      and said to Lucia, 'Very pleased to see you back, ma'am,'
      as she picked her way between the growing deposits of socks
      and other more intimate articles of male attire which were
      now being ranged on the front steps. Georgie hurried back
      to Mallards Cottage to dress in a manner more worthy of his
      reputation, and Elizabeth up to her bedroom for a few
      hours' sleep. Below her oil-skins she still wore the ragged
      remains of the clothes in which she had left Tilling on
      Boxing Day, and now she drew out of the pocket of her
      frayed and sea-stained jacket, a half-sheet of discoloured
      paper. She unfolded it and having once more read the mystic
      words 'Take two hen lobsters', she stowed it safely away
      for future use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Major Benjy next door had been the prey of the
      most sickening reflections; whichever way he turned, fate
      gave him some stinging blow that set him staggering and
      reeling in another direction. Leaning out of an upper
      window of his own house, he observed his clothes and boots
      and articles of toilet being laid out like a bird's
      breakfast on the steps of Mallards, and essaying to grind
      his teeth with rage he discovered that his upper dental
      plate must still be reposing in a glass of water in the
      best spare bedroom which he had lately quitted in such
      haste. To recover his personal property was the first
      necessity, and when from his point of observation he saw
      that the collection had grown to a substantial size, he
      crept up the pavement, seized a bundle of miscellaneous
      articles, as many as he could carry, then stole back again,
      dropping a nail-brush here and a sock-suspender there, and
      dumped them in his house. Three times he must go on these
      degrading errands, before he had cleared all the bird's
      breakfast away; indeed he was an early bird feeding on the
      worms of affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilling was beginning to awake now: the milkman came
      clattering down the street and, looking in amazement at his
      dishevelled figure, asked whether he wanted his morning
      supply left at his own house or at Mallards: Major Benjy
      turned on him so appalling a face that he left no milk at
      either and turned swiftly into the less alarming air of
      Porpoise Street. Again he had to make the passage of his
      Via Dolorosa to glean the objects which had dropped from
      his overburdened arms, and as he returned he heard a
      bumping noise behind him, and saw his new portmanteau
      hauled out by Withers rolling down the steps into the
      street. He emerged again when Withers had shut the door,
      put more gleanings into it and pulled it into his house.
      There he made a swift and sorry toilet, for there was
      business to be done which would not brook delay. Already
      the preparations for the sale of his furniture were almost
      finished; the carpet and hearth-rug in his sitting-room
      were tied up together and labelled Lot 1; the fire-irons
      and a fishing-rod and a rhinoceros-hide whip were Lot 2; a
      kitchen tray with packs of cards, a tobacco jar, a piece of
      chipped <i>cloisonné</i> ware and a roll of toilet paper
      formed an unappetizing Lot 3. The sale must be stopped at
      once and he went down to the auctioneer's in the High
      Street and informed him that owing to circumstances over
      which he had no control he was compelled to cancel it. It
      was pointed out to him that considerable expense had
      already been incurred for the printing and display of the
      bills that announced it, for the advertisements in the
      local press, for the time and trouble already spent in
      arranging and marking the lots, but the Major bawled out:
      'Damn it all, the things are mine and I won't sell one of
      them. Send me in your bill.' Then he had to go to the
      house-agents' and tell them to withdraw his house from the
      market and take down his board, and coming out of the
      office he ran into Irene, already on her way to Grebe, who
      cried out: 'They've come back, old Benjywenjy. Joy! Joy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The most immediate need of having a roof over his head and
      a chair to sit on was now provided for, and as he had
      already dismissed his own servants, taking those of
      Mallards, he must go to another agency to find some sort of
      cook or charwoman till he could get his establishment
      together again. They promised to send an elderly lady,
      highly respectable though rather deaf and weak in the legs,
      to-morrow if possible. Back he came to his house with such
      cold comfort to cheer him, and observed on the steps of
      Mallards half a dozen bottles of wine. 'My God, my cellar,'
      muttered the Major, 'there are dozens and dozens of my wine
      and my whisky in the house!' Again he crept up to the
      abhorred door and, returning with the bottles, put a kettle
      on to boil, and began cutting the strings that held the
      lots together. Just then the church bells burst out into a
      joyful peal, and it was not difficult to conjecture the
      reason for their unseemly mirth. All this before breakfast
      . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      A cup of hot strong tea without any milk restored not only
      his physical stability but also his mental capacity for
      suffering, and he sat down to think. There was the
      financial side of the disaster first of all, a thing
      ghastly to contemplate. He had bought (but not yet paid
      for) a motor, some dozens of wine, a suit of new clothes,
      as well as the mourning habiliments in which he had
      attended the memorial service, quantities of stationery
      with the Mallards stamp on it, a box of cigars and other
      luxuries too numerous to mention. It was little comfort to
      remember that he had refused to contribute to the cenotaph;
      a small saving like that did not seem to signify. Then what
      view, he wondered, would his benefactress, when she knew
      all, take of his occupation of Mallards? She might find out
      (indeed being who she was, she would not fail to do so)
      that he had tried to let it at ten guineas a week and she
      might therefore send him in a bill on that scale for the
      fortnight he had spent there, together with that for her
      servants' wages, and for garden-produce and use of her
      piano. Luckily he had only eaten some beetroot out of the
      garden, and he had had the piano tuned. But of all these
      staggering expenses, the only items which were possibly
      recoverable were the wages he had paid to the staff of
      Mallards between Boxing Day and the date of his tenancy:
      these Elizabeth might consent to set against the debits.
      Not less hideous than this financial débâcle that stared
      him in the face, was the loss of prestige in Tilling.
      Tilling, he knew, had disapproved of his precipitancy in
      entering into Mallards, and Tilling, full, like Irene, of
      joy, joy for the return of the lost, would simply hoot with
      laughter at him. He could visualize with awful clearness
      the chatting groups in the High Street which would vainly
      endeavour to suppress their smiles as he approached. The
      day of swank was past and done, he would have to be quiet
      and humble and grateful to anybody who treated him with the
      respect to which he had been accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unrolled a tiger-skin to lay down again in his hall: a
      cloud of dust and deciduous hair rose from it, pungent like
      snuff, and the remaining glass eye fell out of the socket.
      He bawled <i>'Quai-hai'</i> before he remembered that till
      tomorrow at least he would be alone in the house, and that
      even then his attendant would be deaf. He opened his front
      door and looked out into the street again, and there on the
      doorstep of Mallards was another dozen or so of wine and a
      walking-stick. Again he stole out to recover his property
      with the hideous sense that perhaps Elizabeth was watching
      him from the garden-room. His dental plate--thank God--was
      there too on the second step, all by itself, gleaming in
      the sun, and seeming to grin at him in a very mocking
      manner. After that throughout the morning he looked out at
      intervals as he rested from the awful labour of laying
      carpets and putting beds together, and there were usually
      some more bottles waiting for him, with stray golf-clubs,
      bridge-markers and packs of cards. About one o'clock just
      as he was collecting what must surely be the last of these
      bird-breakfasts, the door of Mallards opened and Elizabeth
      stepped carefully over his umbrella and a box of cigars.
      She did not appear to see him. It seemed highly probable
      that she was going to revoke her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, as well as Major Benjy, had to do a little
      thinking, when he returned from his visit at dawn to
      Mallards. It concerned two points, the cenotaph and the
      kitchen-table. The cenotaph had not been mentioned in those
      few joyful ejaculations he had exchanged with Lucia, and he
      hoped that the ladies had not seen it. So after breakfast
      he went down to the stonemason's and begged him to send a
      trolley and a hefty lot of men up to the churchyard at
      once, and remove the monument to the backyard of Mallards
      Cottage, which at present was chiefly occupied by the
      kitchen-table under a tarpaulin. But Mr Marble (such was
      his appropriate name) shook his head over this: the
      cenotaph had been dedicated, and he felt sure that a
      faculty must be procured before it could be removed. That
      would never do: Georgie could not wait for a faculty,
      whatever that was, and he ordered that the inscription,
      anyhow, should be effaced without delay: surely no faculty
      was needed to destroy all traces of a lie. Mr Marble must
      send some men up to chip, and chip and chip for all they
      were worth till those beautiful lead letters were detached
      and the surface of the stone cleared of all that erroneous
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then I'll tell you what,' said Georgie, with a sudden
      splendid thought, 'why not paint on to it (I can't afford
      any more cutting) the inscription that was to have been put
      on it when that man went bankrupt and I bought the monument
      instead? He'll get his monument for nothing, and I shall
      get rid of mine, which is just what I want . . . That's
      beautiful. Now you must send a trolley to my house and take
      a very big kitchen-table, <i>the</i> one in fact, back to
      Grebe. It must go in through the door of the kitchen-garden
      and be put quietly into the kitchen. And I particularly
      want it done to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well with these thoughtful plans. Georgie saw with
      his own eyes the last word of his inscription disappear in
      chips of marble; and he carried away all the lead letters
      in case they might come in useful for something, though he
      could not have said what: perhaps he would have 'Mallards
      Cottage' let into the threshold of his house for that long
      inscription would surely contain the necessary letters.
      Rather a pretty and original idea. Then he ascertained that
      the kitchen-table had been restored to its place while
      Lucia slept, and he drove down at dinner-time feeling that
      he had done his best. He wore his white waistcoat with onyx
      buttons for the happy occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was looking exceedingly well and much sunburnt. By
      way of resting she had written a larger number of post
      cards to all her friends, both here and elsewhere, than
      Georgie had ever seen together in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgino,' she cried. 'There's so much to say that I
      hardly know where to begin. I think my adventures first,
      quite shortly, for I shall dictate a full account of them
      to my secretary, and have a party next week for all
      Tilling, and read them out to you. Two parties, I expect,
      for I don't think I shall be able to read it all in one
      evening. Now we go back to Boxing Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I went into the kitchen that afternoon,' she said as they
      sat down to dinner, 'and there was Elizabeth. I asked
      her--, naturally, don't you think?--why she was there, and
      she said, "I came to thank you for that delicious
      <i>pâté,</i> and to ask if--" That was as far as she got--I
      must return to that later--when the bank burst with a
      frightful roar, and the flood poured in. I was quite calm.
      We got on to, I should really say into the table--By the
      way, was the table ever washed up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Georgie, 'it's in your kitchen now. I sent it
      back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, my dear. We got into the kitchen-table, really
      a perfect boat, I can't think why they don't make more like
      it, flew by the steps--oh, did the Padre catch a dreadful
      cold? Such a splash it was, and that was the only drop of
      water that we shipped at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but he lost his umbrella, the one you'd given him,'
      said Georgie, 'and the Padre of the Roman Catholic church
      found it, a week afterwards, and returned it to him. Wasn't
      that a coincidence? Go on. Oh no, wait a minute. What did
      you mean by calling out "Just wait till we get back"?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why of course I wanted to tell you that I had found
      Elizabeth in my kitchen,' said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hurrah! I guessed you meant something of the kind,' said
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, out we went--I've never been so fast in a
      kitchen-table before--out to sea in a blinding sea-fog. My
      dear; poor Elizabeth! No nerve of any kind! I told her that
      if we were rescued, there was nothing to cry about, and if
      we weren't all our troubles would soon be over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor had put some fish before Lucia. She gave an awful
      shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, take it away,' she said. 'Never let me see fish again,
      particularly cod, as long as I live. Tell the cook. You'll
      see why presently, Georgie. Elizabeth got hysterical and
      said she wasn't fit to die, so I scolded her--the best plan
      always with hysterical people--and told her that the longer
      she lived, the less fit she would be, and that did her a
      little good. Then it got dark, and there were fog-horns
      hooting all round us, and we called and yelled, but they
      had much more powerful voices than we, and nobody heard us.
      One of them grew louder and louder, until I could hardly
      bear it, and then we bumped quite gently into it, the
      fog-horn's boat I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gracious, you might have upset,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, it was like a liner coming up to the quay,' said
      Lucia. 'No shock of any kind. Then when the fog-horn
      stopped, they heard us shouting, and took us aboard. It was
      an Italian trawler on its way to the cod-fishery (that's
      why I never want to see cod again) on the Gallagher Banks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was lucky too,' said Georgie, 'you could make them
      understand a little. Better than if they had been Spanish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About the same, because I'm convinced, as I told
      Elizabeth, that they talked a very queer Neapolitan
      dialect. It was rather unlucky, in fact. But as the Captain
      understood English perfectly, it didn't matter. They were
      most polite, but they couldn't put us ashore, for we were
      miles out in the Channel by this time, and also quite lost.
      They hadn't an idea where the coast of England or any other
      coast was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wireless?' suggested Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It had been completely smashed up by the dreadful gale the
      day before. We drifted about in the fog for two days, and
      when it cleared and they could take the sun again--a
      nautical expression, Georgie--we were somewhere off the
      coast of Devonshire. The Captain promised to hail any
      passing vessel bound for England that he saw, but he didn't
      see any. So he continued his course to the Gallagher Banks,
      which is about as far from Ireland as it is from America,
      and there we were for two months. Cod, cod, cod, nothing
      but cod, and Elizabeth snoring all night in the cabin we
      shared together. Bitterly cold very often: how glad I was
      that I knew so many callisthenic exercises! I shall tell
      you all about that time at my lecture. Then we found that
      there was a Tilling trawler on the bank, and when it was
      ready to start home we trans-shipped--they call it--and got
      back, as you know, this morning. That's the skeleton.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the most wonderful skeleton I ever heard,' said
      Georgie. 'Do write your lecture quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia fixed Georgie with her gimlet eye. It had lost none
      of its penetrative power by being so long at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now it's your turn for a little,' she said. 'I expect I
      know rather more than you think. First about that memorial
      service.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, do you know about that?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. I found the copy of the Parish Magazine waiting
      for me, and read it in bed. I consider it to have been very
      premature. You attended it, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We all did,' said Georgie. 'And after all, the Padre said
      extremely nice things about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I felt very much flattered. But all the same it was too
      early. And you and Major Benjy were chief mourners.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie considered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm going to make a clean breast of it,' he said. 'You
      told me you had left me Grebe, and a small sum of money,
      and your lawyer told me what that meant. My dear, I was too
      touched, and naturally, it was proper that I should be
      chief mourner. It was the same with Major Benjy. He had
      seen Elizabeth's will, so there we were.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly an irresistible curiosity seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Major Benjy hasn't been seen all day,' he said. 'Do tell
      me what happened this morning at Mallards. You only said on
      the telephone that he had just gone home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, bag and baggage,' said Lucia. 'At least he went first
      and his bag and baggage followed. Socks and things, you saw
      some of them on the top step. Elizabeth was mad with rage,
      a perfect fishwife. So suitable after coming back from the
      Gallagher Banks. But tell me more. What was the next thing
      after the memorial service?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The hope of keeping the knowledge of the cenotaph from
      Lucia became very dim. If Lucia had seen the February
      number of the Parish Magazine she had probably also seen
      the April number in which appeared the full-page
      reproduction of that monument. Besides, there was the
      gimlet eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The next thing was that I put up a beautiful cenotaph to
      you and Elizabeth,' said Georgie firmly. '"In loving memory
      of by me." But I've had the inscription erased to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laid her hand on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Georgie, I'm glad you told me,' she said. 'As a
      matter of fact I knew, because Elizabeth and I studied it
      this morning. I was vexed at first, but now I think it's
      rather dear of you. It must have cost a lot of money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It did,' said Georgie. 'And what did Elizabeth think about
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Merely furious because her name was in smaller letters
      than mine,' said Lucia. 'So like the poor thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was she terribly tarsome all these months?' asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tiresome's not quite the word,' said Lucia judicially.
      'Deficient rather than tiresome, except incidentally. She
      had no idea of the tremendous opportunities she was
      getting. She never rose to her chances, nor forgot our
      little discomforts and that everlasting smell of fish.
      Whereas I learned such lots of things, Georgie: the Italian
      for starboard and port--those are the right and left sides
      of the ship--and how to tie an anchor-knot and a running
      noose, and a clove-hitch, and how to splice two ends of
      fishing-line together, and all sorts of things of the most
      curious and interesting kind. I shall show you some of them
      at my lecture. I used to go about the deck barefoot (Lucia
      had very pretty feet) and pull on anchors and capstans and
      things, and managed never to tumble out of my berth on to
      the floor when the ship was rolling frightfully, and not to
      be sea-sick. But poor Elizabeth was always bumping on to
      the floor, and sometimes being sick there. She had no
      spirit. Little moans and sighs and regrets that she ever
      came down the Tilling hill on Boxing Day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia leaned forward and regarded Georgie steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't fathom her simply because she was so
      superficial,' she said. 'But I feel sure that there was
      something on her mind all the time. She used often to seem
      to be screwing herself up to confess something to me, and
      then not to be able to get it out. No courage. And though I
      can make no guess as to what it actually was, I believe I
      know its general nature.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How thrilling!' cried Georgie. 'Tell me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's eye ceased to bore, and became of far-off focus,
      keen still but speculative, as if she was Einstein
      concentrating on some cosmic deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, why did she come into my kitchen like a burglar
      on Boxing Day?' she asked. 'She told me she had come to
      thank me for that <i>pâté</i> I sent her. But that wasn't
      true: anyone could see that it wasn't. Nobody goes into
      kitchens to thank people for <i>pâtés.</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva guessed that she had gone there to see the
      Christmas-tree,' said Georgie. 'You weren't on very good
      terms at the time. We all thought that brilliant of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then why shouldn't she have said so?' asked Lucia. 'I
      believe it was something much meaner and more underhand
      than that. And I am convinced--I have those perceptions
      sometimes, as you know very well--that all through the
      months of our Odyssey she wanted to tell me why she was
      there, and was ashamed of doing so. Naturally I never asked
      her, because if she didn't choose to tell me, it would be
      beneath me to force a confidence. There we were together on
      the Gallagher Banks, she all to bits all the time, and I
      should have scorned myself for attempting to worm it out of
      her. But the more I think of it, Georgie, the more
      convinced I am, that what she had to tell me and couldn't,
      concerned that. After all, I had unmasked every single plot
      she made against me before, and I knew the worst of her up
      till that moment. She had something on her mind, and that
      something was why she was in my kitchen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's far-away prophetic aspect cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall find out all right,' she said. 'Poor Elizabeth
      will betray herself some time. But, Georgie, how in those
      weeks I missed my music! Not a piano on board any of the
      trawlers assembled there! Just a few concertinas and
      otherwise nothing except cod. Let us go, in a minute, into
      my music-room and have some Mozartino again. But first I
      want to say one thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie took a rapid survey of all he had done in his
      conviction that Lucia had long ago been drowned. But if she
      knew about the memorial service and the cenotaph there
      could be nothing more except the kitchen-table, and that
      was now in its place again. She knew all that mattered.
      Lucia began to speak baby-talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie,' she said. ''Oo have had dweffel disappointy--'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was too much. Georgie thumped the table quite hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't,' he cried. 'How dare you say that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ickle joke, Georgie,' piped Lucia. 'Haven't had joke for
      so long with that melancholy Liblib. 'Pologize. 'Oo not
      angry wif Lucia?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but don't do it again,' said Georgie. 'I won't have
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You shan't then,' said Lucia, relapsing into the
      vernacular of adults. 'Now all this house is spick and
      span, and Grosvenor tells me you've been paying all their
      wages, week by week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naturally,' said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was very dear and thoughtful of you. You saw that my
      house was ready to welcome my return, and you must send me
      in all the bills and everything to-morrow and I'll pay them
      at once, and I thank you enormously for your care of it.
      And send me in the bill for the cenotaph too. I want to pay
      for it, I do indeed. It was a loving impulse of yours,
      Georgie, though, thank goodness, a hasty one. But I can't
      bear to think that you're out of pocket because I'm alive.
      Don't answer: I shan't listen. And now let's go straight to
      the piano and have one of our duets, the one we played
      last, that heavenly Mozartino.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the next room. There was the duet ready on
      the piano, which much looked as if Lucia had been at it
      already, and she slid on to the top music-stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We both come in on the third beat,' said she. 'Are you
      ready? Now! <i>Uno, due, TRE!'</i>
    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched Major Benjy, who had not been out all day
      except for interviews with agents and miserable traverses
      between his house and the doorsteps of Mallards, dined
      alone that night (if you could call it dinner) on a pork
      pie and a bottle of Burgundy. A day's hard work had
      restored the lots of his abandoned sale to their proper
      places, and a little glue had restored its eye to the bald
      tiger. He felt worse than bald himself, he felt flayed, and
      God above alone knew what fresh skinnings were in store for
      him. All Tilling must have had its telephone-bells (as well
      as the church bells) ringing from morning till night with
      messages of congratulation and suitable acknowledgments
      between the returned ladies and their friends, and he had
      never felt so much like a pariah before. Diva had just
      passed his windows (clearly visible in the lamplight, for
      he had not put up the curtains of his snuggery yet) and he
      had heard her knock on the door of Mallards. She must have
      gone to dine with the fatal Elizabeth, and what were they
      talking about now? Too well he knew, for he knew Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in spirit he could have been present in the dining-room,
      where only last night he had so sumptuously entertained
      Diva and Georgie and Mrs Bartlett, and had bidden them
      punish the port, he would not have felt much more cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In my best spare room, Diva, would you believe it?' said
      Elizabeth, 'with all the drawers full of socks and shirts
      and false teeth, wasn't it so, Withers? and the cellar full
      of wine. What he has consumed of my things, goodness only
      knows. There was that <i>pâté</i> which Lucia gave me only
      the day before we were whisked out to sea--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But that was three months ago,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--and he used my coal and my electric light as if they
      were his own, not to mention firing,' said Elizabeth, going
      on exactly where she had left off, 'and a whole row of
      beetroot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Diva was bursting to hear the story of the voyage. She knew
      that Georgie was dining with Lucia, and he would be telling
      everybody about it to-morrow, but if only Elizabeth would
      leave the beetroot alone and speak of the other she herself
      would be another focus of information instead of being
      obliged to listen to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear Elizabeth,' she said, 'what does a bit of beetroot
      matter compared to what you've been through? When an old
      friend like you has had such marvellous experiences as I'm
      sure you must have, nothing else counts. Of course I'm
      sorry about your beetroot: most annoying, but I do want to
      hear about your adventures.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll hear all about them soon,' said Elizabeth, 'for
      tomorrow I'm going to begin a full history of it all. Then,
      as soon as it's finished, I shall have a big tea-party, and
      instead of bridge afterwards I shall read it to you. That's
      absolutely confidential, Diva. Don't say a word about it,
      or Lucia may steal my idea or do it first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a word,' said Diva. 'But surely you can tell me some
      bits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, there is a certain amount which I shan't mention
      publicly,' Elizabeth said. 'Things about Lucia which I
      should never dream of stating openly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those are just the ones I should like to hear about most,'
      said Diva. 'Just a few little titbits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth reflected a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to be hard on her,' she said, 'for after all
      we were together, and what would have happened if I had not
      been there, I can't think. A little off her head perhaps
      with panic: that is the most charitable explanation. As we
      swept by the town on our way out to sea she shrieked
      out--"Au reservoir: just wait till we come back." Diva, I
      am not easily shocked, but I must say I was appalled. Death
      stared us in the face and all she could do was to make
      jokes! There was I sitting quiet and calm, preparing myself
      to meet the solemn moment as a Christian should, with this
      screaming hyena for my companion. Then out we went to sea,
      in that blinding fog, tossing and pitching on the waves,
      till we went crash into the side of a ship which was
      invisible in the darkness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How awful!' said Diva. 'I wonder you didn't upset.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly it was miraculous,' said Elizabeth. 'We were
      battered about, the blows against the table were awful, and
      if I hadn't kept my head and clung on to the ship's side,
      we must have upset. They had heard our calls by then, and I
      sprang on to the rope-ladder they put down, without a
      moment's pause, so as to lighten the table for Lucia, and
      then she came up too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Diva, you will bear me witness that I always said, in
      spite of Amelia Faraglione, that Lucia didn't know a word
      of Italian, and it was proved I was right. It was an
      Italian boat, and our great Italian scholar was absolutely
      flummoxed, and the Captain had to talk to us in English.
      There!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on,' said Diva breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The ship was a fishing trawler bound for the Gallagher
      Banks, and we were there for two months, and then we found
      another trawler on its way home to Tilling, and it was from
      that we landed this morning. But I shan't tell you of our
      life and adventures, for I'm reserving that for my reading
      to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, never mind then,' said Diva. 'Tell me intimate things
      about Lucia.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We mustn't judge anybody,' she said, 'and I won't: but oh,
      the nature that revealed itself! The Italians were a set of
      coarse, lascivious men of the lowest type, and Lucia
      positively revelled in their society. Every day she used to
      walk about the deck, often with bare feet, and skip and do
      her callisthenics, and learn a few words of Italian; she
      sat with this one or that, with her fingers actually
      entwined with his, while he pretended to teach her to tie a
      knot or a clove-hitch or something that probably had an
      improper meaning as well. Such flirtation (at her age too),
      such promiscuousness, I have never seen. But I don't judge
      her, and I beg you won't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But didn't you speak to her about it?' asked Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I used to try to screw myself up to it,' said Elizabeth,
      'but her lightness positively repelled me. We shared a
      cabin about as big as a dog kennel, and oh, the sleepless
      nights when I used to be thrown from the shelf where I lay!
      Even then she wanted to instruct me, and show me how to
      wedge myself in. Always that dreadful superior attitude,
      that mania to teach everybody everything except Italian,
      which we have so often deplored. But that was nothing. It
      was her levity from the time when the flood poured into the
      kitchen at Grebe--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do tell me about that,' cried Diva. 'That's almost the
      most interesting thing of all. Why had she taken you into
      the kitchen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear thing!' she said. 'What a lovely appetite you have
      for details! You might as well expect me to remember what I
      had for breakfast that morning. She and I had both gone
      into the kitchen; there we were, and we were looking at the
      Christmas-tree. Such a tawdry tinselly tree! Rather like
      her. Then the flood poured in, and I saw that our only
      chance was to embark on the kitchen-table. By the way, was
      it ever washed up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, without a scratch on it,' said Diva, thinking of
      the battering it was supposed to have undergone against the
      side of the trawler . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth had evidently not reckoned on its having come
      ashore, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am surprised that it didn't go to bits,' she said. 'But
      let us go into the garden-room. We must really talk about
      that wretched sponger next door. Is it true he's bought a
      motorcar out of the money he hoped my death would bring
      him? And all that wine: bottles and bottles, so Withers
      told me. Oceans of champagne. How is he to pay for it all
      now with his miserable little income on which he used to
      pinch and scrape along before?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what nobody knows,' said Diva. 'An awful crash for
      him. So rash and hasty, as we all felt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They settled themselves comfortably by the fire, after
      Elizabeth had had one peep between the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not the least sorry for having been a little severe
      with him this morning,' she said. 'Any woman would have
      done the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers entered with a note. Elizabeth glanced at the
      handwriting, and turned pale beneath the tan acquired on
      the cod-banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From him,' she said. 'No answer, Withers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I read it?' said Elizabeth, when Withers had left
      the room, 'or throw it, as it deserves, straight into the
      fire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, read it,' said Diva, longing to know what was in it.
      'You must see what he has to say for himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth adjusted her pince-nez and read it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor wretch,' she said. 'But very proper as far as it
      goes. Shall I read it you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do, do, do,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth read:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'My Dear Miss Elizabeth (if you will still permit me to
      call you so)--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very proper,' said Diva.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't interrupt, dear, or I shan't read it,' said
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      '--call you so. I want first of all to congratulate you
      with all my heart on your return after adventures and
      privations which I know you bore with Christian courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Secondly I want to tender you my most humble apologies for
      my atrocious conduct in your absence, which was unworthy of
      a soldier and Christian, and, in spite of all, a gentleman.
      Your forgiveness, should you be so gracious as to extend it
      to me, will much mitigate my present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most sincerely yours (if you will allow me to say so),
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      'Benjamin Flint'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      'I call that very nice,' said Diva. 'He didn't find that
      easy to write!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I don't find it very easy to forgive him,' retorted
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elizabeth, you must make an effort,' said Diva
      energetically. 'Tilling society will all fly to smithereens
      if we don't take care. You and Lucia have come back from
      the dead, so that's a very good opportunity for showing a
      forgiving spirit and beginning again. He really can't say
      more than he has said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor could he possibly, if he's a soldier, a Christian and
      a gentleman, have said less,' observed Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, but he's done the right thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth rose and had one more peep out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I forgive him,' she said. 'I shall ask him to tea
      to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth carried up to bed with her quantities of food for
      thought and lay munching it till a very late hour. She had
      got rid of a good deal of spite against Lucia, which left
      her head the clearer, and she would be very busy to-morrow
      writing her account of the great adventure. But it was the
      thought of Major Benjy that most occupied her. Time had
      been when he had certainly come very near making honourable
      proposals to her which she always was more than ready to
      accept. They used to play golf together in those days
      before that firebrand Lucia descended on Tilling; he used
      to drop in casually, and she used to put flowers in his
      buttonhole for him. Tilling had expected their union, and
      Major Benjy had without doubt been on the brink. Now, she
      reflected, was the precise moment to extend to him a
      forgiveness so plenary that it would start a new chapter in
      the golden book of pardon. Though only this morning she had
      ejected his golf-clubs and his socks and his false teeth
      with every demonstration of contempt, this appeal of his
      revived in her hopes that had hitherto found no fruition.
      There should be fatted calves for him as for a prodigal
      son, he should find in this house that he had violated a
      cordiality and a welcome for the future and an oblivion of
      the past that could not fail to undermine his celibate
      propensities. Discredited owing to his precipitate
      occupation of Mallards, humiliated by his degrading
      expulsion from it, and impoverished by the imprudent
      purchase of wines, motor-car and steel-shafted drivers, he
      would surely take advantage of the wonderful opportunity
      which she presented to him. He might be timid at first,
      unable to believe the magnitude of his good fortune, but
      with a little tact, a proffering of saucers of milk, so to
      speak, as to a stray and friendless cat, with comfortable
      invitations to sweet Pussie to be fed and stroked, with
      stealthy butterings of his paws, and with, frankly, a
      sudden slam of the door when sweet Pussie had begun to make
      himself at home, it seemed that unless Pussie was a
      lunatic, he could not fail to wish to domesticate himself.
      'I think I can manage it,' thought Elizabeth, 'and then
      poor Lulu will only be a widow, and I a married woman with
      a well-controlled husband. How will she like that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Such sweet thoughts as these gradually lulled her to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon evident that the return of the lost, an event
      in itself of the first magnitude, was instantly to cause a
      revival of those rivalries which during the autumn had
      rendered life at Tilling so thrilling a business. Georgie,
      walking down to see Lucia three days after her return,
      found a bill-poster placarding the High Street with notices
      of a lecture to be delivered at the Institute in two days'
      time by Mrs Lucas, admission free and no collection of any
      sort before, during or after. 'A modern Odyssey' was the
      title of the discourse. He hurried on to Grebe, and found
      her busy correcting the typewritten manuscript which she
      had been dictating to her secretary all yesterday with
      scarcely a pause for meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, I thought it was to be just an after-dinner reading,'
      he said, straight off, without any explanation of what he
      was talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia put a paper-knife in the page she was at, and turned
      back to the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My little room would not accommodate all the people who, I
      understand, are most eager to hear about what I went
      through,' she said. 'You see, Georgie, I think it is a duty
      laid upon those who have been privileged to pass unscathed
      through tremendous adventures to let others share, as far
      as is possible, their experiences. In fact that is how I
      propose to open my lecture. I was reading the first
      sentence. What do you think of it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Splendid,' said Georgie. 'So well expressed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I make some allusion to Nansen, and Stanley and
      Amundsen,' said Lucia, 'who have all written long books
      about their travels, and say that as I do not dream of
      comparing my adventure to theirs, a short verbal recital of
      some of the strange things that happened to me will
      suffice. I calculate that it will not take much more than
      two hours, or at most two and a half. I finished it about
      one o'clock this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you have been quick about it,' said Georgie. 'Why,
      you've only been back three days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pushed the pile of typewritten sheets aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie, it has been terrific work,' she said, 'but I had
      to rid myself of the incubus of these memories by writing
      them down. Aristotle, you know; the purging of the mind.
      Besides, I'm sure I'm right in hurrying up. It would be
      like Elizabeth to be intending to do something of the sort.
      I've hired the Institute anyhow--'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now that is interesting,' said Georgie. 'Practically every
      time that I've passed Mallards during these last two days
      Elizabeth has been writing in the window of the
      garden-room. Frightfully busy: hardly looking up at all. I
      don't know for certain that she is writing her
      Odyssey--such a good title--but she is writing something,
      and surely it must be that. And two of those times Major
      Benjy was sitting with her on the piano-stool and she was
      reading to him from a pile of blue foolscap. Of course I
      couldn't hear the words, but there were her lips going on
      like anything. So busy that she didn't see me, but I think
      he did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Lucia, forgetting her lecture for the moment.
      'Has she made it up with him then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must have. He dined there once, for I saw him going
      in, and he lunched there once, for I saw him coming out,
      and then there was tea, when she was reading to him, and I
      passed them just now in his car. All their four hands were
      on the wheel, and I think he was teaching her to drive, or
      perhaps learning himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And fancy his forgiving all the names she called him, and
      putting his teeth on the doorstep,' said Lucia. 'I believe
      there's more than meets the eye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, much more,' said he. 'You know she wanted to marry him
      and nearly got him, Diva says, just before we came here.
      She's having another go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Clever of her,' said Lucia appreciatively. 'I didn't think
      she had so much ability. She's got him on the hop, you see,
      when he's ever so grateful for her forgiving him. But
      cunning, Georgie, rather low and cunning. And it's quite
      evident she's writing our adventures as hard as she can.
      It's a good thing I've wasted no time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to see her face when she comes back from her
      drive,' said Georgie. 'They were pasting the High Street
      with you, as I came. Friday afternoon, too: that's a good
      choice because it's early closing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course, that's why I chose it,' said Lucia. 'I
      don't think she can possibly be ready a whole day before
      me, and if she hires the Institute the day after me, nobody
      will go, because I shall have told them everything already.
      Then she can't have hired the Institute on the same day as
      I, because you can't have two lectures, especially on the
      same subject, going on in the same room simultaneously.
      Impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Grosvenor came in with the afternoon post.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And one by hand, ma'am,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, of course, looked first at the one by hand. Nothing
      that came from outside Tilling could be as urgent as a
      local missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Georgie!' she cried. 'Delicious complication! Elizabeth
      asks me--me--to attend her reading in the garden-room
      called "Lost to Sight", at three o'clock on Friday
      afternoon. Major Benjamin Flint has kindly consented to
      take the chair. At exactly that hour the Padre will be
      taking the chair at the Institute for me. I know what I
      shall do. I shall send a special invitation to Elizabeth to
      sit on the platform at my lecture, and I shall send another
      note to her two hours later as if I had only just received
      hers, to say that as I am lecturing myself that afternoon
      at the Institute, I much regret that, etc. Then she can't
      say I haven't asked her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when they come back from their drive this afternoon,
      she and Major Benjy,' cried Georgie, 'they'll see the High
      Street placarded with your notices. I've never been so
      excited before except when you came home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension next day grew very pleasant. Elizabeth, hearing
      that Lucia had taken the Institute, did her best to deprive
      her of an audience, and wrote personal notes not only to
      her friends of the immediate circle, but to chemists and
      grocers and auctioneers and butchers to invite them to the
      garden-room at Mallards at three o'clock on the day of
      battle in order to hear a <i>true</i> (underlined) account
      of her adventure. Lucia's reply to that was to make a
      personal canvass of all the shops, pay all her bills, and
      tell everyone that in the interval between the two sections
      of her lecture, tea would be provided gratis for the
      audience. She delayed this manoeuvre till Friday morning,
      so that there could scarcely be a counter-attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same morning, the Padre, feeling that he must do his
      best to restore peace after the engagement that was now
      imminent, dashed off two notes to Lucia and Elizabeth,
      saying that a few friends (this was a lie because he had
      thought of it himself) had suggested to him how suitable it
      would be that he should hold a short service of
      thanksgiving for their escape from the perils of the sea
      and of cod-fisheries. He proposed therefore that this
      service should take place directly after the baptisms on
      Sunday afternoon. It would be quite short, a few prayers,
      the general thanksgiving, a hymn ('Fierce raged the tempest
      o'er the deep'), and a few words from himself. He hoped the
      two ladies would sit together in the front pew which had
      been occupied at the memorial service by the chief
      mourners. Both of them were charmed with the idea, for
      neither dared refuse for fear of putting herself in the
      wrong. So after about three forty-five on Sunday afternoon
      (and it was already two forty-five on Friday afternoon)
      there must be peace, for who could go on after that joint
      thanksgiving?
    </p>
    <p>
      By three o'clock on Friday there was not a seat to be had
      at the Institute, and many people were standing. At the
      same hour every seat was to be had at the garden-room, for
      nobody was sitting down in any of them. At half-past three
      Lucia was getting rather mixed about the latitude and
      longitude of the Gallagher Bank, and the map had fallen
      down. At half-past three Elizabeth and Major Benjy were
      alone in the garden-room. It would be fatiguing for her, he
      said, to read again the lecture she had read him yesterday,
      and he wouldn't allow her to do it. Every word was already
      branded on his memory. So they seated themselves
      comfortably by the fire and Elizabeth began to talk of the
      loneliness of loneliness and of affinities. At half-past
      four Lucia's audience, having eaten their sumptuous tea,
      had ebbed away, leaving only Irene, Georgie, Mr and Mrs
      Wyse, and Mr and Mrs Padre to listen to the second half of
      the lecture. At half-past four in the garden-room Elizabeth
      and Major Benjy were engaged to be married. There was no
      reason for (in fact every reason against) a long
      engagement, and the banns would be put up in church next
      Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So they'll all know about it, <i>Benjino mio,'</i> said
      Elizabeth, 'when we have our little thanksgiving service on
      Sunday afternoon, and I shall ask all our friends, Lucia
      included, to a cosy lunch on Monday to celebrate our
      engagement. You must send me across some of your best
      bottles of wine, dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As if you didn't know that all my cellar was at your
      disposal,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth jumped up and clapped her hands. 'Oh, I've got
      such a lovely idea for that lunch,' she said. 'Don't ask me
      about it, for I shan't tell you. A splendid surprise for
      everybody, especially Lulu.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was slightly chagrined next day, when she offered
      to read her lecture on practically any afternoon to the
      inmates of the workhouse, to find that Lucia had already
      asked all those who were not bedridden or deaf to tea at
      Grebe that very day, and hear an abridged form of what she
      had read at the Institute: an hour was considered enough,
      since perhaps some of them would find the excitement and
      the strain of a longer intellectual effort too much for
      them. But this chagrin was altogether wiped from her mind
      when on Sunday morning at the end of the second lesson the
      Padre published banns of marriage. An irrepressible buzz of
      conversation like a sudden irruption of bluebottle flies
      filled the church, and Lucia, who was sitting behind the
      choir and assisting the altos, said 'I thought so' in an
      audible voice. Elizabeth was assisting the trebles on the
      Cantoris side, and had she not been a perfect lady, and the
      scene a sacred edifice, she might have been tempted to put
      out her tongue or make a face in the direction of the
      Decani altos. Then in the afternoon came the service of
      thanksgiving, and the two heroines were observed to give
      each other a stage kiss. Diva, who sat in the pew
      immediately behind them, was certain that actual contact
      was not established. They resumed their seats, slightly
      apart.

    <p>
      As was only to be expected, notes of congratulation and
      acceptance to the lunch on Monday poured in upon the young
      couple. All the intimate circle of Tilling was there, the
      sideboard groaned with Major Benjy's most expensive wines,
      and everyone felt that the hatchet which had done so much
      interesting chopping in the past was buried, for never had
      two folk been so cordial to each other as were Lucia and
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took their places at the table. Though it was only
      lunch there were menu cards, and written on them as the
      first item of the banquet was 'Lobster <i>à la
      Riseholme'.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie saw it first, though his claim was passionately
      disputed by Diva, but everybody else, except Lucia, saw it
      in a second or two and the gay talk dropped dead. What
      could have happened? Had Lucia, one day on the Gallagher
      Banks, given their hostess the secret which she had so
      firmly withheld? Somehow it seemed scarcely credible. The
      eyes of the guests, pair by pair, grew absorbed in
      meditation, for all were beginning to recall a mystery that
      had baffled them. The presence of Elizabeth in Lucia's
      kitchen when the flood poured in had never been fathomed,
      but surely . . . A slight catalepsy seized the party, and
      all eyes were turned on Lucia who now for the first time
      looked at the menu. If she had given the recipe to
      Elizabeth, she would surely say something about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia read the menu and slightly moistened her lips. She
      directed on Elizabeth a long penetrating gaze that mutely
      questioned her. Then the character of that look altered.
      There was no reproach in it, only comprehension and
      unfathomable contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghastly silence continued as the lobster was handed
      round. It came to Lucia first. She tasted it and found that
      it was exactly right. She laid down her fork, and grubbed
      up the imperfectly buried hatchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you sure you copied the recipe out quite correctly,
      <i>Elizabetha mia?'</i> she asked. 'You must pop into my
      kitchen some afternoon when you are going for your
      walk--never mind if I am in or not--and look at it again.
      And if my cook is out too, you will find the recipe in a
      book on the kitchen-shelf. But you know that, don't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, dear,' said Elizabeth. 'Sweet of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then everybody began to talk in a great hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
