<h2>HOW FRED DELANEY TALKED TO MR. MUNDEN, A POET--AND THEN HAD
BREAKFAST WITH HIS FAMILY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>'Happy New Year!' Fred Delaney said, standing in the doorway
and smiling at the in-no-way beautiful person of Mr. Munden.</p>
<p>He had switched on the electric light, and the illumination
revealed Patrick Munden lying half in, half out of the
bedclothes. No, he was not beautiful, his thin pointed face
unshaven, his black hair spread about the pillow, his lean body
protected from the cold by pyjamas, grey with blood-red stripes,
by no means so fresh as they should be. The light pressed on
Munden's eyes and he opened them, stared wildly about him, then,
cursing, buried his face in the pillow.</p>
<p>'Happy New Year!' Delaney said again.</p>
<p>'What the hell--'</p>
<p>'Eight-thirty. You asked me as a special favour to call
you.'</p>
<p>Munden raised his head and stared at Delaney. It was not a
bad-looking face. The blue eyes were good, the forehead broad and
clear, the chin finely pointed. He looked clever and peevish and
hungry. He stretched himself, his open pyjama jacket showing a
chest skeletonic and hairy. He rubbed his eyes with a hairy
wrist.</p>
<p>'Oh, it's you, is it? Let me sleep, can't you?'</p>
<p>Delaney watched him with genial good temper.</p>
<p>'I'm doing you a favour. You said last night it would be the
greatest of your life. You have to see the editor of something or
other at ten sharp.'</p>
<p>'He can go to hell. Turn the light off and let me sleep.'</p>
<p>'You said I was to drag you out of bed if necessary--that your
whole life depended on your getting there at ten.'</p>
<p>'Well, it doesn't. Let me sleep, can't you?'</p>
<p>'All right. But I'll leave the light on . . .'</p>
<p>'No, don't go.' Munden sat up, blinking. 'How damnably fresh
you look! It's revolting. You were up till three, I don't
doubt--'</p>
<p>'I was,' Delaney said cheerfully. 'I don't need a lot of
sleep.'</p>
<p>'Well, I do. . . . Oh, blast! Why did I ever tell you anything
about it?'</p>
<p>'You were very serious. Most earnest. You said you must begin
the New Year properly.'</p>
<p>'Speaking of which, can you lend me a fiver?' Munden asked.
'Only for a week.'</p>
<p>'Afraid I haven't got such a thing,' Delaney said,
laughing.</p>
<p>'Hang it all, I paid you the rent only a week ago--'</p>
<p>'Thanks very much. But those are the terms, you know. If you
don't pay you go. Although we'd hate to lose you.'</p>
<p>Munden sighed.</p>
<p>'Look in the trousers, old man, will you? They're hanging over
the chair. See if there's anything there.'</p>
<p>Delaney looked in the trousers and found half a crown, some
coppers, a lipstick and a half-filled packet of cigarettes. He
laid these things on the dressing-table.</p>
<p>'You don't use lipstick, I hope, Patrick?'</p>
<p>'No, of course not. What do you think I am? How much is
there?'</p>
<p>'Two and ninepence halfpenny.'</p>
<p>'I'll make them advance something on the two articles. You
wouldn't like to buy a Chrysler, would you?'</p>
<p>'A Chrysler? Whatever for?'</p>
<p>'It's a marvellous bargain. Ponsonby's only had it a year and
simply not used it at all. He'd let you have it for one-fifty and
I'd get a commission.'</p>
<p>Delaney laughed. 'We go round in our Morris--just as we always
have--same old family, same old Morris.'</p>
<p>Munden looked at him with curiosity. 'I don't understand you,
Fred. You own this house; every bit of it is let to people who
pay their rent. You're none of you what I'd call extravagant and
yet you never have any cash.' He stared resentfully. He went on:
'You're a horrid sight--so cheerful and clean and bright. You're
all like that. I ought to hate the lot of you. So unintellectual
too. You never read a book, have horrible bourgeois politics,
believe in things, in England, beautiful virginal girls, Dickens,
cricket, football. . . . Oh, God! You're vile! I don't know why I
go on living here.'</p>
<p>'You live here, Patrick,' Delaney said, 'because you get this
room damn cheap, it's a first-class address, and you like us--you
can have breakfast with us if you want to.'</p>
<p>'I don't need your charity,' Munden said. 'What I really want
to know is why you look so disgustingly happy, all of you? What
is there to be happy about?'</p>
<p>'Oh, the usual things. Little things mostly. For instance, I'm
hungry and I'm going down to a good breakfast.'</p>
<p>'No. Wait a minute. I really want to know . . .'</p>
<p>'Want to know what?'</p>
<p>'Why you Delaneys are so cheerful and why I don't hate you for
it.'</p>
<p>'Why should you hate us for being cheerful?'</p>
<p>'How <i>can</i> you be cheerful with the state the world's
in?'</p>
<p>Delaney turned to the door. 'Here, I've really got to go.
You're properly awake now. I've done my job. Anyway,' he went on,
'the world's been in a mess plenty of times before and will be
again. As a family we're just like anybody else. I've got the
hell of a temper, and you should see Meg when I come back at
three in the morning, and Kitty can raise the deuce--'</p>
<p>'Kitty's a darling,' Munden said morosely. 'Whenever I make
love to her she laughs.'</p>
<p>'Yes, Kitty can look after herself,' Delaney said,
smiling.</p>
<p>'No. But don't you understand?' Munden began to get excited.
'You're going against the whole trend of the world. We shall all
be Communists soon. Those of us who are left. The next war--'</p>
<p>'All right,' Delaney said. 'You go on talking to yourself.
I've heard all this so many times. Meanwhile there's my breakfast
. . .'</p>
<p>Munden got up and leaned his long bony legs over the bed. He
stretched his long bony arms and yawned. His hair stood up on
end. Some of it tickled his eyes.</p>
<p>'You're wonderful for your years,' he said to Delaney.</p>
<p>'I'm only fifty-two.'</p>
<p>'You look about forty.'</p>
<p>He was right. Delaney was fine for his years. He still had
plenty of hair, brown and curly. His eyes were bright blue, his
cheeks ruddy, his body tall, straight, muscular, non-corpulent.
He had beautiful hands, and when he smiled he wrinkled at the
corners of his eyes. His nose was straight and his mouth
soft-lined but not weak. His clothes were excellent--easy,
well-fitting, fresh as flowers in the spring, but, beyond all
things, comfortable. He looked what he was, an active, care-free,
good-natured Irish gentleman, who might have the devil of a
temper, whose heart was good, conscience easy, sentimental a bit,
quarrelsome a bit, honest, careless, and of an excellent
digestion.</p>
<p>'It's a funny thing,' Munden said peevishly. 'I might get my
clothes from your tailor, be shaved by the best barber in London,
have a bath twice a day, walk for miles. I'd never look straight
from the canvas as you do. . . . Not that I want to,' he added.
'You're the type--good healthy Englishman--that to-day is an
absurd anachronism. In another fifty years your type will be
extinct, thank God. You're loathed by the whole world. Americans
detest you, Germans spit on you, Italians despise you--'</p>
<p>'I'm not English. I'm Irish,' Delaney said mildly.</p>
<p>'You were born in London, your father was born in London, your
grandfather was born in London.'</p>
<p>'Yes, London's my city, thank God. And this house is my house.
One more year of battle, beginning this minute. Do you know,
Patrick, we never thought we'd keep her this last year, Meg and
I?'</p>
<p>'Keep her--keep who?'</p>
<p>'Why, the house. Everyone wants her, Dollinger and Druitt are
just aching to tear her down and build filthy flats over her
corpse. Margraves would give us almost anything for her. Wunder
and Thompson are at us every week--'</p>
<p>'Well, why don't you sell her? You and Meg torture yourselves
making both ends meet, so you tell me. Get a nice fat cheque for
her and live in the country where you belong. She's bound to go
sooner or later. Everything's going. Nothing but shops here soon.
You can hear Shepherd Market's dying groans now if you
listen.'</p>
<p>'We'll keep her, we'll keep her!' Delaney cried. 'Do you know
Delaneys have lived in this house for two hundred and fifty
years? Do you know the William and Mary clock in our dining-room
has been on that same Adam fireplace for nearly two hundred
years?'</p>
<p>'Well, what of it?' said Munden contemptuously. 'Isn't that
just what's wrong with you? You and your clocks! Your William and
Mary world is done for, completely finished, and the sooner it's
buried the better. There's no British aristocracy any more, thank
God. There's no leisure, no money, no old culture, no beautiful
England. There's a new raw world, with every man for himself and
all of us living under the shadow of imminent death. That tickles
a man's vitals, <i>that's</i> something to watch and share
in--the whole of civilization going down together with a
crash-bang. That's truth, that's reality, <i>that's
poetry!'</i></p>
<p>Munden was quite excited now and was walking about the room,
tossing his head and hugging his meagre body with his long
arms.</p>
<p>'I've got you out of bed anyway,' said Delaney. He turned at
the door for one last word. 'As to the end of civilization, what
rot you poor fellows talk! Civilization doesn't end like that.
There are changes, of course, but nothing that's ever happened in
a place dies. The history in this house is deathless. Anyway, Meg
and I are going to keep it, save it for another year of its
lovely life if we ourselves die in the process.'</p>
<p>'Yes, you stuff it with decaying bodies and call that life.
"Going, going, gone, gentlemen!" The British aristocracy! Who
wants to watch the last agonies, catch the final groan, the
wheezy whimper, the faint whistle through the air as the life
expires! By God, that's good!'</p>
<p>Munden wheeled round. 'There's stuff for a poem there!'</p>
<p>'There's stuff for a poem,' Delaney said, 'in every inch of
the ground from Piccadilly Circus to Hyde Park Corner. Isn't it
pleasant to think, Patrick, of how, not very long ago as time is,
the Anglo-Saxons knew this very place where we are as
Bulinga-Fen, a horrible marshy swamp? Do you know that round
Buckingham Palace the ground is still water-logged?' As Delaney
worked himself up a faint touch of brogue could be caught. Munden
had moved into the bathroom, and Delaney came to the other side
of the bed and began to shout. 'Yes, and think of Hay Hill where
the Prince Regent was robbed once--Aye Hill it is really--the Aye
Bourne, and so you get Tyburn. Well, there was a stream ran all
the way down from Hampstead through Marylebone, across Oxford
Street, Stratford Place, lower part of Brook Street, Bruton Mews
to the foot of Hay Hill. It ran through May Fair and entered the
Green Park in the hollow of Piccadilly (there was a stone bridge
over it). Then on, under Buckingham Palace to the Thames. All the
way from Hampstead heights to the Thames. It's still running. The
Early Britons bathed in it and you can still see a trickle of it
under the ventilators of Green Park. The Aye Bourne, the
meadowlands of Mayfair, the milkmaids' song where the Ritz is,
the reaper whistling in Half Moon Street, hares coursed down Bond
Street--'</p>
<p>'Oh, damn and blast!' Munden said. 'What did I use a new
razor-blade for?'</p>
<p>'And then,' continued Delaney, who, his bright eyes shining,
had advanced tothe bathroom door (he must raise his voice now
against the running bath-water), 'what about Old Q? He would sit
with his muffs and his stockings from Paris and his
three-cornered hat in his Piccadilly window ogling the women, his
head shaded by a parasol, held by a powdered footman--or old
General Blücher, sitting in an armchair on the top of a flight of
steps at the hall door, smoking a pipe and acknowledging the
salutations of the passer-by? Or the crowd breaking the windows
of Apsley House and learning that Wellington's Duchess lay dead
inside and going quietly away, or Palmerston riding his horse
every morning down Piccadilly to the House of Commons . . . and
who started it all? Do you know that, Pat? Ever heard of Robert
Baker? He was a tailor, my lad, who in 1615 was rated at twenty
pence for ten acres of agricultural land behind the King's Mews
at the Town's End. That started it all round here, for the King's
Mews went from Trafalgar Square to the Haymarket, and Mr. Baker,
tailor, built many houses and one of them was called
"Piccadilly." There his residence was at the corner of Windmill
Street, and perhaps they were mocking the tailor for setting
himself up in the world and his house was a nickname after a ruff
or collar called "Pickadel" . . .'</p>
<p>Munden raised his face from the bath in which he was now
lying. 'My dear Fred, you may be my landlord, but that's no
reason at all why you should also be my schoolmaster. . . .'</p>
<p>'And then there's Baroness Burdett-Coutts' white cockatoo
which my father used to see hanging every day inside the window
overlooking Green Park. A mob of rioters stopped in the street
once to argue whether it was real or sham and, having stopped,
they raised a cheer for the Baroness and forgot the riot.'</p>
<p>'And was it real?' asked Munden.</p>
<p>'No. It was sham.'</p>
<p>'Well, that's enough. If you won't lend me five quid, clear
out. Only a week, mind.'</p>
<p>'Afraid not,' Delaney sighed. 'Meg will be thinking I've
overslept. Cheer up, Patrick. The editor will take your articles,
I don't doubt. I read one of them somewhere last week saying that
any writers to-day who are not Communists should be ashamed of
themselves. Why shouldn't writers be what they happen to be? Why
this sheep and goat division by politics?'</p>
<p>'Don't you begin to talk about literature, Fred. I suppose
there's no one in London knows less about it than you do.'</p>
<p>'Well, I can't read your poetry, if that's what you mean,'
said Delaney.</p>
<p>'It isn't written for you.'</p>
<p>'Who is it written for?'</p>
<p>Munden grinned. 'Damned if I know,' he said.</p>
<p>Fred Delaney went on down to his breakfast.</p>
<p>Patrick Munden's attic rooms were at the top of the house,
then came the flat of Lady Helen Pake and Lady Millie Pake, then
the flat of the Honourable 'Smoke' Pullet and 'Dodie' Pullet, his
wife. Lastly, on the ground floor, was the abiding-place of the
Delaneys themselves.</p>
<p>So he must, to reach his breakfast, descend from the top to
the bottom of the house--must descend, after leaving Munden's
attic, by the great staircase itself. It always amused them to
call it that, although in fact it was not so very large--only
'quite, quite too beautiful,' as Millie Pake, sighing gently,
used to murmur. They had cleverly--when, in 1930, the great
'conversion' had taken place--managed without disturbing the
staircase. 'Like a piece of music,' their friend Connie
Beaminster always said it was. Perhaps it was. As, from below,
you looked upwards and saw it turn the corner the rhythm of its
movement was musical, and the dark deep patina of the wood,
exquisitely simple, profoundly right, was like a Palestrina tune
that repeats itself and repeats, but never too often. 'Rather
rot,' Fred Delaney thought, 'comparing all these things with one
another. A staircase is a staircase.'</p>
<p>But, although he was almost running down, he yet had time to
reflect that he was glad (and proud too) that they had been able
to keep it as it was. That 'conversion' time had been terrible,
dividing the big rooms into little ones without destroying too
fearfully their character, putting in the baths, the
kitchenettes. Poor house, poor house! It had seemed, when the
work was in progress, as though a blow had been struck at its
very heart; but that young architect, Mortimer, how clever he had
been! and how tremendous his bill had been too! Well, no
matter--it was all paid for by now, and so long as Munden and the
dear old Pakes and the Pullets paid up at the proper time, ends
were just met and the house was saved. The day would come when,
his ship sailing into port, he would turn them out and restore
the house to its own true life again; then Bullock should be
master, and to his sons in their turn the house should be handed
on. . . .</p>
<p>Whistling, he had reached the door of his own particular
dining-room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before we go inside with him a word ought to be said about the
Delaneys; Margaret--Meg--Mrs. Delaney, her son Bullock, her
daughter Kitty.</p>
<p>Meg Delaney was at this time a tall, rather stout, magnificent
middle-aged lady who looked, in her more dishevelled moments,
like a gipsy fortuneteller at the Derby. Sometimes her
raven-black hair was beautifully dressed and her clothes superb.
Because of her black hair and high colouring she could wear
clothes of gold and orange and crimson. When, altogether at her
grandest, she entered a ballroom or was a late guest at a fine
party (she was always unpunctual) everyone gasped. She was better
than the Queen of Sheba. Her uncle, Lord Renys, a little horsy
man, full of oaths, had, when alive, been so proud of her that,
if he had had any money, he would have showered her with gifts.
But most people adored her even when they were most enraged with
her.</p>
<p>She had always had in her a burning fire of
happiness--happiness often enough without rhyme or reason.
Sometimes this fire died down very low and then she would cry:
'My God, why, oh, why was I ever born!' Her tempers were as
prodigious as evanescent, her generosities absurdly lavish and
sometimes disastrous. She was altogether honest, loyal,
courageous and indiscreet. Her behaviour was extravagant and
vexing.</p>
<p>But this happiness that she felt and was quite unable to
account for, gave her a kind of radiance; it was a happiness
entirely without selfishness. She made friends on the instant
with anybody--on buses, trains, in shops. Beggars in the street
always caught her. You might tell her again and again that they
were rolling in riches and, anyway, drank what she gave them--it
made no difference. She had always been as poor as a rat herself:
her father, Captain Wendover, 'Mumps' Wendover, had lived by
precarious gambling on the Continent, attended by a succession of
beautiful ladies. Her mother having died when Meg Wendover was
six, Meg Wendover had kicked herself up into life rather than
grown into it. She adored Delaney her husband and her two
children, but preserved, with all her impetuosity, warmth of
heart, friendliness, a curious, unstained independence.</p>
<p>They were perhaps rather naïve and unsophisticated, these
Delaneys; many people thought so and patronized them heartily.
Kitty and Bullock had something of this same <i>naïveté.</i></p>
<p>Kitty, nineteen years of age, was, everyone said, 'very
sweet.' She disliked intensely this description of herself. What
she wanted to be was strange, austere, remote, but gaiety would
keep breaking in. She was tall and slight, dark in colouring like
her mother, with very bright eyes, but not really beautiful,
because her nose was snub. Unlike her mother, she was neat and
quietly dressed. She was not clever, read but little, cared
nothing for music or painting or (the craze at this time in her
set) current politics or social economy. She was neither
Communist nor Fascist, but tried to listen seriously when her
friends ardently discussed these things. She had hosts of friends
and was constantly made love to. She was as free in speech and
knowledge sexually as were all her friends, but remained
virginal, apart, in such matters. One thing about her that her
friends thought odd was that she was rigidly teetotal, not from
any principles but because she detested the taste of liquor. When
a man kissed her she did not resist, but, in some fashion,
conveyed to him that he would find someone else more amusing.</p>
<p>She had, of course, very little money but managed cleverly. At
present the strongest instinct developed in her was the maternal.
She was passionately interested in people, and anyone who was in
trouble came to her chiefly because she was never bored and had a
practical mind. She was always on the side of the underdog, often
very unwisely. She could be impetuous like her mother and then,
quite unexpectedly, calm, practical, reserved. She supposed she
would have to find a job, but <i>which</i> job was the question.
Her only real gifts lay in her relations with people. Some of her
friends thought that she would be excellent at Girls' Clubs and
such. But she knew that she would not be good, because as soon as
anything was organized she lost her interest in it.</p>
<p>Behind her gaiety, love of life, busy days, devotion to her
family, was a private never-expressed wonder and
expectation--something was coming, something <i>must</i> be
coming, a great event that would, in one instant, change
everything. What this event would be she had no idea.</p>
<p>Her brother, Bullock, was in one particular a great
disappointment. He had been a small stocky boy, a useful
scrum-half at King's School, Canterbury, where he had received
his nickname of Bullock. (His real name was Stephen.) He had then
gone to Oxford, been cox in his College's first boat, and, to
everyone's surprise, had not grown an inch. He had never grown
any more and was so short that it would have been ludicrous had
he not been broad-shouldered and sturdy-legged. He had a round
merry face and was immaculate in his appearance.</p>
<p>He had a deep voice rather like his mother's and the blue eyes
of his father.</p>
<p>He made a very small and precarious income by writing 'funny
bits' for <i>Punch</i> and other publications. He had two gods at
whose shrine he worshipped: Surtees and Mr P. G. Wodehouse. He
liked almost every girl in sight but no girl in particular. He
would sit, with his short legs crossed, thinking, then suddenly
slap his knee, cry aloud 'By Jove, that's good!' whip out a
pocket-book and write something down. He worshipped his sister,
owned a dachshund called Endless to whom he confided many of his
best witticisms; he found most people extraordinarily funny.
Especially poets like Munden seemed to him excruciating, but he
had learned that to laugh in people's faces hurt their feelings,
so he would stare, his face very grave, his eyes puckered up,
struggling to be polite. He had beautiful manners. To old ladies
especially he was quite old-world in his courtesy. Like all the
Delaneys he was very happy-go-lucky and refused to be excited
when Mussolini was rude to his country or Hitler talked about
gun-fodder. He kept his small bedroom as neat as a pin and was
apt to be indignant if anyone touched his possessions. He was
always busy from morning to night and would comment in an
exaggerated way on quite ordinary things like the state of the
weather, an accident with the Morris or an incident at his
Club.</p>
<p>When Delaney stood inside the room and looked at his family he
felt, as he always did on such occasions, a deep affection. The
room itself with its cream-coloured walls, the fireplace, the
William and Mary clock, the pictures, two Rowlandsons, a large
portrait over the fireplace of his grandfather, a fine merry
gentleman in a very decorative uniform, his grandmother, an old
lady with twinkling eyes, her black corkscrew curls hanging from
under a lace cap, a Wilson landscape, the very good Chippendale
chairs, the sideboard with the silver breakfast dishes, the dark
plum-coloured window curtains, the fire leaping with a kind of
eagerness as though it had never been a fire before and had had
no idea what an amusing thing it would prove to be, Endless the
dachshund, his black beady eyes fixed in a kind of trance on his
master; his family--Kitty, as always officiating, pouring out the
coffee, laughing at something her mother had just said; Bullock
at the sideboard lifting up the silver covers to see what was
there; and Meg--Meg herself--in a loose morning-gown of some dark
purple with gold braid at the neck and wrists, a costume that
would have seemed tawdry on most women but looked exactly right
on her, her black hair piled high on her head (she would not
dream of cutting, clipping, bobbing, waving, cropping), her long
white hands with the rings that she loved, examining her letters,
talking, laughing, swearing, reminiscing, despairing, exulting. .
. . He looked at her and thought how, early that same morning,
she had lain in his arms and been like a little child, rubbing
her cheek against his, enchanting him with those long slow kisses
that were so peculiarly hers. For he had known many, many women
in his time and there had never been any one like Meg--no one
like Meg for comradeship, gaiety, sensuality, honesty, humour,
and that final necessity in life, freedom of soul both given and
taken when life demanded it.</p>
<p>She heard the door close and looked up. 'You're late,
disgracefully late. We are all finished. Here's a letter from
Barty Perrin and he has the cheek to ask for a meal next Friday.
He doesn't like us, but he'd go anywhere rather than pay for his
own food. . . .'</p>
<p>Delaney went over and kissed his daughter. 'Darling, how are
you? Did you sleep beautifully? . . . Oh, Barty isn't a bad sort
but he hasn't a bean. He worships you, but you're so unkind to
him. Yes, I'm late. I went up to get Patrick out of bed and he
kept me talking. . . .'</p>
<p>'And,' Meg went on, 'here's a letter from old Alice Pomery.
Why, she must be ninety if she's a day! I can remember her
perfectly well at Nice, that time Father won such a lot at the
tables and rented that absurd house in the Rue de--Rue de
<i>what</i> was its name? Never mind. It was a house like a pair
of pink stays set up on end--all ribs. We had the most enormous
parties. I used to come down for dessert and old men covered with
scent used to pinch my legs. I remember Alice perfectly well. She
was a little woman with a face like a pretty pig and she had a
French poodle that I adored. She was married then to old Lord
Worgan and when he tried to kiss her she'd hold her head back and
say "Non. Non. Pas aujourd'hui." She liked to talk the most
excruciating French and no one knew why, and he ran away with a
Salvation Army girl from Liverpool or somewhere. Extraordinary
how I remember that house. I was supposed to share a room right
at the top with a French governess whom Father had engaged, but
she was always sleeping with some man or other, so I'd be alone
and--terrified! My God, but I was terrified! The house used to
shake as though it had an ague, and there were rats. I saw one
once, nibbling at the wood of one of the chairs. You didn't know
rats did that, did you, darling? And the whole place smelt of
patchouli. There was dust everywhere and plants in pots, dead as
anything. . . .'</p>
<p>She stopped quite suddenly and stared at her husband.</p>
<p>'How beautiful you are, Fred! So fresh and cool. Give me a
kiss, darling.'</p>
<p>Fred kissed her. Her warm arm lay against his cheek.</p>
<p>Then he remarked: 'It's New Year's Day.' No one said anything,
so he repeated it: 'It's New Year's Day.'</p>
<p>Kitty smiled at him over the coffee. 'Of course, darling, we
know that. I was with the Whartons at Quaglino's and we drank the
New Year in over and over again.' She wrinkled her forehead.
'Nice place. Nice people--but I don't know. I agree with Endless.
Breakfast's better than supper.'</p>
<p>'Why, if that's <i>all</i> you've got to say about the New
Year! Don't you realize? We've kept the house for another
year--and now we've got to keep it for a year more! Caesar asked
for a rise last night--I'm afraid he'll have to go.'</p>
<p>Bullock lifted his face from his plate. 'Caesar <i>go,</i>
Father? Oh, impossible! We'll never get anyone as good again!
Why, I'd rather give him what I make out of my writing. I would
really.'</p>
<p>Delaney shook his head. 'It's all very well. Give Caesar more
and then the General will want more, and then everything topples
over!'</p>
<p>Meg tore off her two diamond rings and pushed them beside
Delaney's plate.</p>
<p>'Sell these, darling,' she said in her richest contralto. This
was a gesture she'd often made before. They all laughed, and
Endless, who realized that excitement was in the air, gave a
series of short staccato barks.</p>
<p>'No, it's all very well,' Fred Delaney went on. 'Patrick says
we're fools to hold on to the house as we do when we could get a
nice fat sum and live comfortably in Sussex or somewhere. But he
doesn't understand. He knows nothing about the past. He's no
feeling for London or any place. He's as detached as a bird in
the air. All he thinks of is his beastly unintelligible poetry. .
. .'</p>
<p>Meg caught her husband's hand and held it fast.</p>
<p>'It's all right, darling. You shall have your London. You
shall have your house--even though I have to sell my body to keep
it for you. That's what Bridget is always saying: "I'd sell my
body to give Harry what he wants." So silly--no one would give
her a penny for her old body. But what <i>I</i> want to
know'--here she leaned her firm bosom right over the table, her
purple robe floating about her--'is--what does Caesar want a rise
for? We pay him nobly--nobly! <i>Don't</i> we pay him nobly,
Fred? You have all those things in your head. <i>What</i> do we
pay him and why does he want a rise?'</p>
<p>'We pay him,' Delaney said, 'well, I don't know about nobly.
But quite enough. Of course he says he will stay with us even if
we pay him nothing at all. But it's his mother. She can't ever
forget she was lodge-keeper at Wintersmoon. She's the greatest
old boor the world has ever known, and Caesar says she has
neuritis and he has to buy a lot of things for her.'</p>
<p>'Pay him! Pay him!' Meg cried. 'Raise his wages. We'll raise
the rent on the Pullets.'</p>
<p>'You know we can't, darling. It's a miracle they pay us as it
is. <i>How</i> they live I can't imagine.'</p>
<p>'They were at Quaglino's last night,' Kitty remarked. 'Looking
as swell as anything. Dodie was as near nude as not to matter,
but what she <i>did</i> have on was lovely. Must have cost her a
fortune. Two wisps of something and a silver band. They danced
together all the evening.'</p>
<p>'Raise their rent,' Meg said. 'Then they'll go and we'll get
somebody else. "Smoke" Pullet always frightens me. One day he'll
be desperate. I can see it growing behind his eyes. They're nice.
I like them. But I don't want their climax here. You know,
children, this is a happy house. It is really. There isn't a soul
inside it's got a farthing--all the same it's a <i>darling</i>
house, a <i>darling</i> house. I never was so happy
anywhere.'</p>
<p>Bullock, who had finished his breakfast, came from the fire
and laid his cheek for a moment against his mother's.</p>
<p>'Sweetheart, it isn't the house that's happy, it's you. You
really are a radiant woman.'</p>
<p>'I know.' Delaney looked at them all. 'Patrick says we're
revolting. He says we're selfish, self-centred, behind the times.
The world is falling, falling. Civilization is going out with a
bang. And here we are happy, contented.'</p>
<p>'And what did <i>you</i> say?' Kitty asked.</p>
<p>'<i>I</i> said that yes, we <i>were</i> happy. We had small
minds and were pleased with small things. I said, too, that the
world has often fallen to pieces before but nevertheless the
seasons returned punctually and were charming at each return,
that our digestions were good, and we couldn't be called the rich
mocking the poor because there was probably no one in all London
poorer than we were. All the same, perhaps we're smug.' He looked
at Meg and laughed. 'Darling, are you smug?'</p>
<p>She was slipping her diamond rings on and off her fingers. She
looked up aimlessly.</p>
<p>'Am I? I don't know what I am. Who knows what they are
anyway?'</p>
<p>And then the door opened.</p>
<p>First there was Caesar. Caesar's real name was Rudge and he
was butler, footman, messenger boy, shoe-cleaner, gossip and
friend to the Delaney family. He was known also as the Dickens
character, being a remarkable combination of Weller, Pickwick,
Poor Joe, Traddles, Mark Tapley and now and again (Delaney said)
Silas Wegg, all these raised on a basis of Cockney. He had been
in service from birth, his mother being lodge-keeper at
Wintersmoon in the days of the old Duke of Romney. He had been
simply no age at all when he had helped in the pantry, and then
in cocked hat and gaiters sat in the back of the trap that went
to the station for luggage, and then (wonderful promotion) had
been the Duke's own body-servant under Sellars (how deeply he had
loathed Sellars! how truly he had worshipped the old white-haired
Duke!).</p>
<p>Then had come changed times and Wildherne Poole had married,
the old Duke had died, hard days had followed. Wintersmoon had
been closed for a long while and was only open again in part.
Then <i>that</i> Duke had died and his son, still a boy, reigned
in his stead, or rather his mother, the Duchess (a fine good
woman surely), reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>All this Caesar had constantly from his old mother with whom
he lived in two rooms above the news-vendor's in Shepherd Market.
Caesar was short, bony, but very cheerful-featured. No beauty
with his large mouth and sharp little Cockney eyes, but he was a
faithful devoted soul, feeling proud--even in these days--of his
place as a family servant. There were still many of his kind in
London, born into service and proud of it, thinking it no
degradation, hating more than anything else 'the bloody
Bolshies.' '<i>What</i> nonsense!' Caesar would say to Mrs.
Ganter, the cook, known as The General. 'Men's born to be
different. Start 'em all level, and in no time at all one's up,
one's down. Share and share alike! I'd like to see Ma share
anything she's got with anyone else.'</p>
<p>He liked all four Delaneys and would work himself to the bone
for them, but finances were a terrible problem with him. His old
mother was always 'fancying something'--food, drink, a book or a
trinket. And if she didn't get it she'd cry and say that no one
loved her any more and it would be better if she'd died long
before. Her whims and fancies cost money. Moreover Caesar wasn't
sure, but he fancied that for the first time in his life he was
really in love . . . no, he couldn't be sure, but it looked a
little like it.</p>
<p>Dressed in his official black suit, his funny ugly grinning
face glitteringly shaved, he looked a respectable retainer. He
introduced the visitors without a word, as well he might, for
they were part of the family. There were three of them--Larry
Delaney, Fred's brother, Phyllis his wife, and an exceedingly
pretty, slim, shy-looking girl. Larry Delaney resembled his
brother in his fair curly hair, rosy countenance, general
freshness, but he was stouter and coarser. You could see at once,
however, that he had all his elder brother's cheerful
indifference to the dangers of to-morrow and enjoyment of the
present hour. He looked a little less of a person than Fred,
shallower, less important. He earned a precarious living by
acting as a sort of middle-man in Society. That is he went, with
Phyllis his wife, everywhere, discovered that someone wanted to
sell something, persuaded someone else that that was exactly what
he or she wanted to purchase, and then brought buyer and seller
together. He then received a commission. Practically
<i>everything</i> in Mayfair was for sale--pictures, furniture,
silver--you could enter no house or flat in Mayfair nowadays
without someone saying to you, 'Don't you love that Turner
water-colour? I happen to know you could have it for almost a
song. It's a damned shame, but Dodo's being forced to sell almost
<i>all</i> her lovely old things.' So that it was positively
dangerous now in any house or flat to look at anything with too
personal an appreciation because <i>at once</i> someone said, 'Do
you like that? Rather lovely, don't you think? I'll have a word
with Doris after lunch and see if I can't persuade her. . .
.'</p>
<p>Things being as they are, Larry Delaney's job should have been
a lucrative one. There were, however, a number of drawbacks to it
as a career, one of the principal being that people were curious
about payment. Also a sort of Exchange and Mart went on, so that
he would receive a note:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>DARLING LARRY--I'm sure Sophy won't mind if I delay
in paying for the bit of tapestry which really isn't as nice as I
first thought it. I have by the way a really <i>lovely</i>
Charles II musical box which has been in the family ever since
Charles gave it <i>himself</i> to my great-great (ever so many
greats) Aunt who was his Mistress you know for quite a while.
Don't you think Sophy would like the musical box? I'm sure it's
worth a lot more than the tapestry. After all, it was a
<i>gift</i> from a King! Do see what you can do about it, darling
Larry.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, of course, he was as likely as not to get no
commission at all. However, Phyllis and he worked very hard and
went about everywhere and, perhaps, didn't do so badly.</p>
<p>Lastly there was the exquisite silent girl with the white
face, red lips and wide-open startled eyes. She was a Miss Alice
Van Renn, whose old mother was an energetic silly snobbish widow.
Mother and daughter had two rooms in Half Moon Street. The old
lady was aristocratic and poor. The girl Alice had a kind aunt
who had paid for her 'finishing' in Paris. Thence she had but
lately returned. Fred Delaney, in fact, had never seen her
before, and now he stared at this lovely thing in his doorway as
though he had been struck from heaven.</p>
<p>Alice Van Renn had such perfect features that she was almost
unreal. Although her colouring was pale, yet it was exquisite. To
stroke her cheek was the first natural desire of any natural
male, and Delaney was a very natural male indeed. No one knew
whether Alice was brilliantly clever or exquisitely stupid, for
she spoke but little. What was heavenly, maddening, to every man
was that she appeared to be in a kind of trance; she was as yet
unawakened. To be the first to achieve that awakening, there was
an ambition!</p>
<p>In any case at this particular moment Fred Delaney stood with
his mouth a little open, staring, and Meg Delaney saw that it was
so.</p>
<p>'Happy New Year!' said everybody.</p>
<p>And so, with that ancient greeting, new events in the Delaney
family began.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c102" id="c102">CHAPTER II</a></h1>
<h2>BROCKET'S</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>On that same New Year morning, not very far from the Delaneys'
breakfast table, at the precise moment when Fred Delaney gazed
for the first time, open-mouthed, at Miss Alice Van Renn, Mr.
Claude St. John Willoughby woke up in his bed at Number
Twenty-three White Horse Street, Shepherd Market, to find Brocket
standing in his doorway looking at him, even as Patrick Munden
had found Fred Delaney.</p>
<p>A very different greeting this, however, from the other: not
at all friendly--quite the contrary.</p>
<p>Claude St. John Willoughby sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Brocket in his shirt-sleeves and only-too-familiar brown
apron said in a voice intended to be elegantly and even
classically ironic, but, in reality, thick, beery and brutal:</p>
<p>'I was only wondering <i>when</i> your lordship intended to
rise and allow 'is room to be done--no offence, but it's past
nine o'clock.'</p>
<p>These last words were said with a tang like the slap of a wave
on a rock. Mr. Willoughby looked at Brocket and thought how
loathsome he was. Brocket had the build of a prize-fighter, but
instead of the jolly purple countenance set about with a crooked
nose and a cauliflower ear that you might expect, his skin had
the thick grey-white consistency of dough, and his head was
especially unpleasant, being bald like a tonsured priest's, with
a fringe of grey hair round a faintly yellow poll, grey hair that
appeared, unless you looked at it very steadily, to be always a
trifle on the move.</p>
<p>He was clean-shaven, and the end of his wide-nostrilled nose,
his lips, and his hands were always damp. He appeared during most
of the day in his shirt-sleeves and a grey waistcoat on which
there were yellow stains. His sleeves were rolled up and revealed
brawny but unhealthy-pallored arms. On these also grey hairs
crawled. His vast middle was always bound around with a faded
brown apron. He wore in the morning slippers that gave him the
appearance of webbed-feet, for they were sliced at the toes
because of his corns. His slippers could be heard flap-flapping
all over the house.</p>
<p>He was a bachelor but was reputed a devil with the women and
immensely rich. This last was, in all probability, untrue, but he
did own Number Twenty-three and let it out to bachelor gentlemen.
Within Number Twenty-three he ruled like the God of the
Israelites. Everyone trembled at his approach, more especially if
he had had a drop or two. The bachelor gentlemen at present his
tenants were: on the ground floor, Colonel Badget; on the second
floor, Mr. Best; on the third floor, Major Pierson; and on the
top floor, Mr. Willoughby.</p>
<p>Brocket behaved like a self-indulgent sensualist to his
tenants. Of some he made favourites, others he tortured. At this
present time Mr. Best was his favourite and Mr. Willoughby he
tortured.</p>
<p>You may ask then--Why did Mr. Willoughby remain there? He
remained because, in the first place, he was growing old (he had
passed his seventieth birthday) and to change quarters now was an
alarming business; secondly, because he was poor and his room was
cheap; thirdly, because Brocket had a sort of terrible
fascination for him; fourthly, because he could not conceive of
saying: 'Mr. Brocket, I think I will go away now.'</p>
<p>His room was cheap, but it was not very pleasant. It possessed
only one small window and, being immediately under the roof, was
very hot in summer, very cold in winter. He had to share the bath
with Major Pierson on the third floor, and although Major Pierson
had known this when he engaged his rooms, he was sometimes
unagreeable about it.</p>
<p>There was not a great deal of space. There was a wash-stand, a
table, an easy chair, two straight chairs, a glass cabinet behind
which Claude Willoughby kept his treasures, and a wardrobe. On
the mantelpiece were photographs of his mother, a girl to whom he
had once been engaged, and a setter dog that he had once loved.
Over the mantelpiece was an old engraving of Longton Hall in
Derbyshire, once the family place, the house where he had been
born. Everything was extremely neat and tidy. He himself sitting
up in bed, his Adam's-apple moving nervously within his bony
neck, his few grey hairs still tidy on his head, his faint brown
eyes anxious and concerned, was very neat and orderly. His thin
bony hands were almost bloodless against the dark rug with which
he covered the bed on cold nights. He raised one hand now to
stroke nervously his short grey brush-moustache.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry,' he said. 'Something must have happened to the
alarm-clock.'</p>
<p>'Something <i>must,'</i> said Brocket bitterly. 'Didn't you
'ear the girl come in? There's your breakfast been on the table a
hour if a minute--and stone cold by now.'</p>
<p>'No, I didn't hear the girl,' Mr. Willoughby said with
dignity. 'Happy New Year!' he added courteously.</p>
<p>Brocket studied him. 'Marvellous how these old boys go on
living,' he thought. 'You'd have thought <i>he'd</i> have been
dead long ago.'</p>
<p>However, he didn't want Mr. Willoughby to die. He paid the
rent regularly; moreover Brocket felt a kind of sadistic
affection for the old boy. He loved to see the look of timorous
uncertainty creep into those brown eyes, he liked toraise his
voice suddenly so that the old boy jumped, he liked to begin a
complaint slowly, cumulatively, and then listen, with a glowering
brow, to Mr. Willoughby's slow, stammering explanations. Yes, he
almost loved him. Mr. Willoughby was one of his principal daily
entertainments.</p>
<p>However, this morning he had work to do, so with a grunt he
departed and his slippers flip-flappered down the stairs.</p>
<p>Claude was delighted when he was gone. He raised his thin arms
and yawned. Then, very carefully, for he had always, when he woke
in the morning, a touch of lumbago, he got out of bed, felt for
his brown dressing-gown, his faded green slippers, brushed his
few grey locks with his old silver brushes, washed his face and
hands and brushed his teeth, and then, humming a little tune (as
though in pleasure at the departure of Brocket) sat down to his
breakfast. It was not, of course, very agreeable: the tea was
lukewarm, the toast was tough, and the two pieces of bacon had
congealed round the one egg so that the dish looked like a very
unappetizing surrealist painting. Nevertheless he was hungry and
there was the Oxford Marmalade which oversleeping could not
affect.</p>
<p>All the same how very odd that he had <i>not</i> heard the
girl enter! She made always such a clatter! The way that she
breathed through her nose was enough alone to waken him. And,
being an old man, he was wide awake and staring at six o'clock as
a rule. He had, however, gone to bed rather late last night. He
had found at the newsvendor's in Shepherd Market (they maintained
a Lending Library; so obliging and kind they always were!) the
reminiscences of old Colonel Blake called <i>Random Shots and
Tender Memories,</i> and had sat up reading the book. It had
brought the old delightful past so vividly back to him that his
eyes had filled with tears as he read. He had known so many of
the places and people that Reggie Blake had known. He remembered,
as though it were yesterday, Ernest Cassell calling Reggie 'a Tom
Cat with a Hundred Tails,' because Reggie had been an
indefatigable raconteur--bit of a bore that way!</p>
<p>But there it was. He had sat up remembering old times, and so
his breakfast was cold! There were, however, many pleasant things
and one of the pleasantest was his <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> An
extravagance, perhaps; but if so, his only one.</p>
<p>He drew to the fire the old armchair with the tear in the
right arm that always greatly distressed him because he thought
that it must distress the chair who had been for so long a good
and faithful friend to him. He said 'the fire,' but that was a
title by courtesy, for the girl who had lit it an hour and a half
ago had used the coal extravagantly, and now, when there were but
embers and a piece of vexed-looking charred stick, he did not
wish to put on more coal because in that case his allowance for
the day would soon be exhausted.</p>
<p>So he drew his dressing-gown about him and, smiling at one
winking coal as though it were his best friend, stretched out his
legs and read his paper. He read about how terrible had been the
fog and darkness over most of England, how the <i>Codex
Sinaiticus</i> had arrived from Russia in charge of a special
courier, of a terrible railway accident in France on the
Paris-Strasbourg line, and of New Year's Honours conferred on a
number of gentlemen whose names were quite unknown to him. He
read, too, with a rather twisted smile under his little
moustache, of distressed areas and starving multitudes. They
can't be really starving, he thought, because there is always the
dole; I wonder if any of them are quite as poor as I am.
Obviously if you were living at Number Twenty-three White Horse
Street, Mayfair, you couldn't be quite as poor as if you were
living at Number Twenty-three Fish Street, Old Kent Road. And yet
not quite so obviously!</p>
<p>He put down his <i>Telegraph</i> and got out from the drawer
under the cabinet the dark red book where he with extremely neat
accuracy kept his accounts. For once they were on the cheerful
side, for the dividends he had received last week had gone up a
little. As a rule when he had paid Brocket the rent and the bill
for breakfasts and extras, there was almost nothing left at all.
Still, so long as he kept well, he could manage.</p>
<p>It was the thought of possible sickness that truly terrified
him. You might say (and Claude said it to himself sometimes) that
he had no right to live under so high a rent. But Brocket's was
as cheap as he would find in Mayfair, and the whole happiness and
colour of his life came from these streets around him. From
Piccadilly Circus to Hyde Park Corner had been, from the
beginning of conscious things, his world. For sixty years he had
known it, loved it, cherished it, consoled it, thanked it,
congratulated it. For thirty years he had had rooms, very fine
ones too, in Berkeley Street. When Devonshire House had gone it
was as though he himself had lost a rib or a kidney. Nevertheless
he had accommodated himself to the changes. He had not been
foolish about that, for he had known that changes must occur as
they had always occurred. And, at this very moment of time,
January 1st, 1934, the changes at the south end of Berkeley
Square in course of construction were devastating, frightful,
appalling; but he intended, on this very afternoon or possibly
to-morrow afternoon, to walk along there and survey them,
bravely, with his head up as though, in the process of nature,
they were inevitable.</p>
<p>Take him their way, remove his little feet (his feet and hands
were remarkably small) from this piece of ground and he would
die. Simply die. Not that it mattered to anyone but himself
whether he lived or died, but to himself it still mattered a
great deal. He loved to be alive and the little things, the very,
very little things, were quite enough to make his days exciting
and sometimes even melodramatic. . . .</p>
<p>A door, in the dim distance, banged. His bath! Unless he took
it soon, Pierson would be indignant at his having one so late in
the morning and would bark at him like a seal. He hoped that, by
taking one now, he might avoid Pierson altogether.</p>
<p>So he gathered his soap in its talc case, his sponge-bag and
his bath-towel together and proceeded forth. At the bottom of the
short flight of stairs was a long shivering passage, and down
this he must go, passing the doors of Pierson's bedroom and
sitting-room. He always walked tiptoe, tiptoe, and if he reached
the bathroom without arousing anyone he would close the door
behind him and then stand for a moment, smiling, his hand pressed
on his heart.</p>
<p>To-day he was not so fortunate. He was almost in safety when a
door opened and Pierson's voice was heard.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Willoughby! You're late, aren't you?'</p>
<p>Claude turned and felt, as always, that he was taken at a
disadvantage with his old dressing-gown and faded slippers.
However, he answered gallantly.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Pierson! Happy New Year!'</p>
<p>Major Pierson was short, stout, and red of face. He wore a
toupee and was always dressed as though about to lead a charge
against the enemy. His clothes were in themselves ordinary, but
tingling with a kind of combativeness. He was, however, in
reality an amiable man so long as one wasn't a foreigner and had
nothing to say against the British Army, the virtue of English
womanhood and the English climate. A familiar type made plain to
us in many a work of fiction. His <i>individuality</i> (for we
all have souls) lay perhaps in his extreme prudery. He could not
endure a bawdy story nor any light allusion to sex. In spite of a
varied life in India, China and Africa, he still believed that
women were angels, and if an angel strayed, then it was some vile
man's intolerable fault. He had never married, perhaps because he
had never dared to test his beliefs too severely. He regarded
Claude Willoughby as an old woman and therefore pure of heart and
conduct. But he felt a vast superiority to him and treated him
rather as the Squire in the good old days treated a faithful
village dependent. Willoughby never interfered with Pierson's
bathing plans and was scrupulously neat in his behaviour;
nevertheless the sight of Willoughby on the way to the bath
always annoyed him.</p>
<p>'Don't expect you'll find the bath water very hot.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that doesn't matter in the least, thank you.'</p>
<p>'What happened--oversleep yourself?'</p>
<p>'Well, as a matter of fact I did; most unusual--sat up late
reading.'</p>
<p>'Reading, eh? Seen in the paper about these damned
Bolshies?'</p>
<p>'No, as a matter of fact . . . what have they been doing?'</p>
<p>'What have they been doing? What are they always doing?
Plotting against the peace of the world. That's what
<i>they're</i> doing.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I suppose so. It's really terrible.'</p>
<p>'You'd better get in there. Damned draughty this passage.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I suppose so. Thanks very much.' Lying flat in the bath,
Claude was happy. The water was <i>not</i> very warm, but warmer
than it might have been. He reflected: 'Why am I always so
nervous when Pierson speaks to me? He's a very kind man and means
nothing but good. He looks down on me, of course, because he's an
Army man and I'm not. All Army men look down on civilians. But
he's nearly as poor as I am. He has only his Army pension and has
to support, I believe, a very aged mother and an invalid sister.
He is also, I fancy, extremely lonely. He has a Club, which I
haven't, but from what I hear, he's not at all popular. Why,
then, be nervous when he speaks to me? We ought to be friends. I
ought to go down and visit him of an evening. But the mere
thought of visiting him fills me with terror. Besides we should
have nothing to say to one another. He's more agreeable than
Badget, who has money and lets you know it, and less of a bore
than Best, who never stops talking. How charming it would be if
someone lodged in this house who was a real friend and companion!
But you must not, I suppose, expect friends after seventy. I've
had a lot of friends in my time.' And that made him think of
Helen and Millie Pake, very old friends of his. What a good idea!
He would go and have tea with them this afternoon and wish them a
Happy New Year. They were always at home at tea-time and enjoyed
a chat. What an <i>excellent</i> idea! Filled with pleasure, he
finished his bath, dried his little shivering body, and hurried
up to his room again.</p>
<p>He clung to his intention although the scruples, now so
constant with him, that he might bore them, that they would have
other visitors, that he might suffer once more that unpleasant
experience of people looking right through him as though he
didn't exist, crowded about him. He <i>must</i> go out, he
<i>must</i> pay visits. He had noticed in himself lately a
tendency to stay in his room as though there only was to be
really safe. That was dangerous. That way madness lay.</p>
<p>At length in his blue suit with the dark tie and grey gloves
and cane with the ivory head of a dog, and his soft black hat, he
was ready to venture. All he hoped was that he would not
encounter Brocket. One moment's experience of Brocket scowling at
him and the dangers of facing the outside world were greatly
increased. But there was no Brocket to-day and, as he walked into
Shepherd Market, happiness returned to him as it so easily did at
the slightest excuse in the world. Although it was half-past
three in the afternoon there was still a faint sun-stained fog
about. He liked that sun-stained fog almost beyond any other
weather that London provided, and it seemed especially kindly and
reassuring now, for London had been so very dark of late. Lights
were burning in the newsvendor's and, as always, he stopped to
look at the rows of books behind the glass on the opposite side
of the narrow passage. How very many books there were in the
world to be sure! It must take so much energy and trouble to
write a book! He admired authors greatly so long as no one forced
him to read their works.</p>
<p>In Curzon Street there was an orange light in the air and the
Christian Science Church loomed behind the fog almost like a
mystic temple, and the steel and chromium of the new cinema up
the street gleamed like the silver lines of a ship. How greatly
vexed and hurt he had been at the first appearance of that
cinema. It had seemed to him not only an insult to all the past
history and characters of this sacred ground, but a personal
insult to himself as well. He had become, however, not only
accustomed to it but he even liked it. He wished it well. He
enjoyed the photographs of the pictures, the uniformed figure on
guard, the cars that assembled outside it. This after all was
life; it meant happiness to many people, and, because he could
not himself possibly afford to enter it, there was a quality of
mystery there that stirred and excited him.</p>
<p>So, through the orange fog he walked to the home of his
friends.</p>
<p>Outside the door of the handsome house were the names of the
tenants and under each name a little bell: Patrick Munden, Lady
Helen Pake, the Hon. Mark Pullet, Frederick Delaney. He touched
the Pake bell, gave the big door a push and was inside the hall,
then up the beautiful staircase, past the Pullets', challenging
the Pake door. Now, while he waited, once more fears attacked
him. The house was so <i>very</i> silent; everyone within it
might be dead. Suppose they <i>were</i> dead, those two old
ladies, the young girl who looked after them during the day out
on her shopping; dead, the two poor old things, and nobody knew
it! Or suppose, on the other hand, they were entertaining their
friends, as they well might be on New Year's Day, and he would
find himself in a circle of cold, indifferent strangers.
<i>That</i> he would not be able to endure, and so, after a
quarter of an hour, he would depart and return to his lonely room
with nothing to do for the rest of the day but sit and miserably
reflect on his wretched isolation? Or Helen might be in one of
her grand tantrums and sit there, like a tragedy queen, making
life horrible for everybody? Oh, it were better that he had not
come, far, far better, and he was about to turn away and slip
down the stairs again when the door opened and the little maid
was there and, yes, Lady Helen and Lady Mildred were at home and
would he come in, please?</p>
<p>Inside the little hall he listened and was comforted because
there were no gay and raucous voices. There was no New Year's
party at least. And then when he saw his old friends sitting one
on each side of the fire as he had so often seen them before, his
heart beat with happiness. Here was sanctuary, here safety!</p>
<p>The sitting-room was small, as it was bound to be when you
considered that out of the two original rooms there had been
created two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchenette and a
sitting-room. But the ceilings were high, the fireplace noble,
there were flowers and old family silver, an oil painting of
Twyden Hall, the family place, now in the possession of Lord
Rocklyn their brother, and a very fine portrait of Helen and
Mildred painted in the 'Nineties by Sargent. The room was a
little over-full perhaps and you had to walk carefully to avoid
tables and chairs, but it was of a warm and cosy
friendliness.</p>
<p>The ladies themselves were exactly what Claude considered that
ladies ought to be.</p>
<p>Helen was now seventy-five years of age, Millie some five
years younger. Helen was sitting up in her chair, stiff as a
poker, her body thin as a divining-rod. She was pale of cheek,
hawk-like nose, pouches of dark under her eyes, her silver-grey
hair tight about her head. She had long thin hands, so thin that
the light seemed to shine through them. She had a long bony neck
like a hen's and held her head so high that you watched to see
the neck-bones crack. Her magnificent flashing, tempestuous eyes
were her finest feature. This she knew very well, for they had
been called flashing and tempestuous often enough. She had never
been beautiful, but always regal, and now at seventy-five was
more regal than ever. All her life she had been the victim of
fits of imperious temper, but now those fires were dying and she
was slipping into the dusk of evening. She had always behaved
like a queen, for no very adequate reason save that she had been
the eldest daughter of the Earl of Rocklyn. That had mattered
once; alas, it mattered nothing now. That she should be sister of
the present Earl, who, poor Tommy, had wasted and rioted away in
earlier days all the family patrimony and was now a withered
skeleton living in a semi-closed Twyden with a housekeeper and a
pack of dogs, martyred by gout and rheumatism. No, Helen had no
longer any reason for grandeur, but that did not mean that she
was not grand. Although her faculties were still sharp and acute,
she lived in a kind of dream-world, not the Past only, the Past
shot through with the Present (which she loathed and despised),
then finally transmuted into a place of colours, rhythms, voices
that had little relation to the reality of other people.</p>
<p>Millie, her sister, had worshipped and served her all her life
long. In appearance Millie was short, plump, with snow-white hair
and a most amiable behaviour. She too had her dignities and could
rebuke a presumer most effectively, but she loved gossip and the
small transactions of human nature and could not therefore hate
the modern world as her sister did. She was the practical one,
managed the small income of herself and her sister; it was the
great business of her life to save her sister every possible
discomfort and inconvenience. She worshipped her, was sometimes
terrified of her, loved her and spoilt her. In spite of their
smallness of means, confined existence and occasional aches and
pains, Millie got much pleasure from life, although she
considered that the way the world was going was appalling.
Appalling and exciting. At the back of her mind was always the
fear that they would wake up one morning and discover that they
had no money. The investments, once so fat and satisfying,
appeared with every year to dwindle. Of course, come the worst,
they could always go to Twyden and make their home with Tommy,
the dogs, and Mrs. Hardcastle, the housekeeper. Anything more
appalling Millie could not conceive.</p>
<p>They were both delighted to welcome dear Claude Willoughby. He
was exactly their contemporary, and though, in younger days, they
had patronized him and thought him a good little man to run
messages for them, he was now one of the few holders of the fort
remaining. Moreover he had known everyone they had known and was
an excellent gossip: he held identically their views about the
present disgraceful state of the world; and, best of all, he had
even less money than they had.</p>
<p>Helen received him as Queen Elizabeth might have greeted an
ambassador from a foreign country, but her beautiful eyes
mellowed nevertheless. Millie showed her pleasure without any
dignity and told him to draw his chair to the fire and that tea
would be there in a minute. They had rung for it just before he
came in. Then Millie began at once, without a moment's pause, to
ask him whether he had heard of the latest horrible behaviour of
Princess Corleone.</p>
<p>Very briefly, Princess Corleone was the villain of the piece
in the lives of the members of the Pake world. Princess Corleone
was an American, and there was nothing against being that,
because some of the most charming women in the Edwardian world
had been American. She had arrived in London before the War as a
Mrs Peter Twine, the wife of an American steel man. She had
attempted then a little social advancement. She had been at once
checked on all sides. There had been nothing whatever to
recommend her as she had been ugly, vulgar, with a voice like a
pea-hen, and had never stopped talking. However, Mr. Peter Twine
had died, leaving her a large fortune, and she had married an
Italian, Prince Corleone. He had been killed at Caporetto and she
had returned to London, finding in the new post-war world all
that she had needed. To her house in Grosvenor Street she had
gradually lured politicians, painters, authors, younger
nobilities, and finally Royalty itself.</p>
<p>Paula Corleone haunted the Pakes and their friends and
fascinated them as well. In the old days they would not have
considered her at all, and would have scorned to gossip about
her. But now from their little fastness, with the wild savage new
world roaring about them, they saw her as a kind of witch
directing the storm. They saw her with her little restless body,
her sharp eyes, they heard her shrill never-ceasing monotone,
they could not learn sufficient detail of her personal life, her
'affairs,' her parties, her social indiscretions. They thought of
her continually because they were baffled by her power. In the
only world that they had actively realized she would not have
been permitted for a moment. But she had money, and money now was
everything. Birth, tradition, taste, morals, decent behaviour,
charming manners, all these counted for nothing now beside money.
They had been brought up never to consider money, never to
mention it, never to think of it. In the old days there had been
plenty. The parties at Twyden had been famous, and when there had
not been parties at Twyden there had been parties everywhere
else: house-parties in enormous houses, with vast rooms, icy
passages, lawns dripping under the rain, the shrill cry of
peacocks, frosty mornings and the Hunt assembled before the
drawing-room windows, beautiful September mornings on Scottish
moors and the ladies at luncheon-time driving out to join the
gentlemen, endless, endless dinner parties, endless, endless
balls--and always plenty of money.</p>
<p>Now no one stayed a minute over anything; off they went in a
motor-car or an aeroplane. No one goes to church, no one goes to
bed, no one goes to stay with anyone for more than a night. The
noise about one's ears is a frenzy; all the world is preparing
for the last War that is to exterminate everything--and, above
all this horror, riding her broomstick, directing proceedings in
her shrill vulgar accents, is Paula Corleone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very quiet, though, is it now in this little room, the lights
shaded, the tea in front of the fire, Helen sitting bolt upright,
half in a reality that applauds the little macaroons (she has
always loved sweet things) and enjoying the detail of Paula
Corleone poking the Minister for War (or was it Agriculture?) in
the ribs and screaming at him like a parrot about a new laxative
that she had been trying. Yes, and watching, as Helen loved to
do, the Chinese cabinet with the red dragons that had been among
her very earliest perceptions at Twyden, there near the great
stone fireplace in the Twyden drawing-room, when as a small
infant she had been brought down for an hour with her mother and,
on some especial occasion, like a birthday, had been permitted to
turn back the panels and open the musk-scented little drawers,
black with gold carvings of trees and pagodas. . . .</p>
<p>The Chinese cabinet was theirs now--Tommy had allowed them to
keep it--and Helen had but to gaze at it and all the past came
swimming up, the great country-houses, the gardens, the long line
or the downs, the tinkling Sunday reiteration of the bell in the
village church. So, nibbling her macaroon, she heard but little
of what Millie and Claude were saying.</p>
<p>Claude was happy and thankful too. For really this visit had
turned out delightfully and he would have plenty, in his room at
evening, to think over. They were talking about the new Duchess
of Wrexe, who, only eighteen, had just married the Duke, a
bachelor of forty. She was, they said, exceedingly beautiful and
the daughter of a Devonshire farmer.</p>
<p>'What the old Duchess would have said!' Millie exclaimed. 'You
remember her of course?'</p>
<p>'I should think I do,' said Claude. 'Time of the Boer
War--Rossiter's portrait of her is in the Tate. Did you know
that? I went with Connie Beaminster the other day to see it. A
silly woman, Connie, don't you think? But she means well.'</p>
<p>'She's a great friend of the Delaneys. . . . Dear, dear! What
an autocrat the old Duchess was! And now see what her grandson is
doing!'</p>
<p>'There are some farmers of quite good family,' Claude said
reflectively. 'But I hear that this girl's mother's father had a
shop in Taunton or somewhere. . . .'</p>
<p>'Oh, well,' said Millie briskly. 'No one cares any more about
such things. They'd call us dreadful snobs, Claude, if they heard
us, and so I suppose--'</p>
<p>'Snobs!' Helen suddenly broke in, to their astonishment. 'If
you tell me, Millie, that good blood doesn't matter and decent
manners and bringing children up to know their betters--'</p>
<p>'I'm not sure,' said Millie, shaking her head. 'After all,
Helen, our childhood wasn't <i>really</i> very happy. You know we
were terrified of Papa and never dared open our mouths and always
had chilblains and had to wear boards down our backs at lessons
and could never read an interesting book on Sundays. I <i>do</i>
think children are much happier nowadays, and as to birth,
Charles the Second made an orange-girl a Duchess, and look at the
way the Prince Regent used to go on! It was only Queen Victoria
who altered everything, and although I wouldn't say a word
against her, she did fill England with hypocrites, and no one can
say that we're <i>that</i> any more. After all, in the light of
history sixty years is a very short time. Until Victoria, England
was quite a <i>rough</i> country, and now she's gone back to
being <i>rough</i> again!'</p>
<p>Helen said, 'You've been <i>reading</i> something,
Millie.'</p>
<p>'Not particularly. Only Lytton Strachey, and Mrs. Pullet tells
me he's <i>quite</i> old-fashioned now.'</p>
<p>'You'd better go to one of Paula Corleone's
luncheon-parties.'</p>
<p>'Oh no, of course not. I should be <i>most</i> uncomfortable!
But of course we <i>are</i> very old-fashioned, living all by
ourselves shut up in here, and we may as well recognize it. Why,
do you know, Claude, there's one of the most modern young poets
living at the top of this house now. I passed him on the stairs
the other day--such a wild-looking young man, but he gave me
quite a nice frightened sort of smile. Fancy <i>my</i>
frightening a modern young poet!'</p>
<p>Millie laughed. 'Now if it had been <i>Helen</i> . . .!'</p>
<p>Helen smiled a grim smile. 'Millie's getting so light-headed,
Claude, that I don't know what'll become of her!'</p>
<p>'Oh no, I'm not, but after all it isn't any use to pretend
we're living in the old world. Two old ladies, buried away and
forgotten--that's what we are!'</p>
<p>Her voice shook a little. She moved over and gave her sister a
kiss.</p>
<p>'Put some coal on the fire, Claude, will you?'</p>
<p>Claude did so--not too much, for he could not help thinking of
the economy that his own coal demanded.</p>
<p>The flames leapt up, they talked on cosily, as though Claude
were their brother. The watcher on the threshold, looking at the
figures, bent like ghosts about the fire, might have thought that
they were seeking one another's protection and comfort. . . .</p>
<p>'And what about you, Claude? How are things going with
you?'</p>
<p>'Very well indeed, thank you . . . oh, very well.'</p>
<p>'No more of that lumbago? I remember you were bothered . .
.'</p>
<p>'Oh, ever so slight. There's a new embrocation I've been
recommended . . .'</p>
<p>'And that horrible man, your landlord? He hasn't been
offensive? If you have any trouble I'll come along and tell him
what I think of him.'</p>
<p>'Oh no. I don't <i>like</i> him, you know--couldn't possibly
<i>like</i> him. It's only his manner. I can't believe that he
means to be as rude as he seems. But he can't <i>do</i> anything,
you know. Only make it a little uncomfortable.'</p>
<p>Helen is half asleep. Her back is as straight as ever, but she
is young, <i>so</i> young, and although not beautiful still
striking. Even Aunt Milchester allows that she is
<i>striking.</i> She is kneeling in front of the Chinese cabinet.
She is old enough now; she need not ask permission any longer.
She turns back the crimson panels, fingers with her thumb the
raised gold on the smooth black surface of the drawers. Someone
is practising the piano--Millie in the schoolroom. She hears the
voice of Bannister, the butler--'I will go and see, my lady'--and
then her mother's thin, rather languid voice: 'Ah, there you are,
Helen! We are going down to the Lodge. I have to speak to Gummery
about something'--and that sudden glorious vista through the
window as you raise your head from the cabinet, of the sun behind
the great oak and every leaf glittering. A baby moon just fading
from the pale blue-white sky, and the thick bark-like scent of
chrysanthemums. Millie playing 'The Carnival of Venice' in the
schoolroom. Bannister, so fat, so unctuous, so devoted. 'I'll
remember, my lady. Certainly, my lady. . . .'</p>
<p>'I must be going now.' Claude is going, going, gone. . . .</p>
<p>'Come again soon and see us.'</p>
<p>'I will. I will.'</p>
<p>But in the hall downstairs there was still a little adventure.
As he moved to the hall door another door opened and a young girl
stood there, all in dark red with a little fur cap on her very
dark hair.</p>
<p>She smiled. What could he do but bow? He knew her, of
course--Miss Delaney. He felt that he must account for himself
lest she should think that he had been robbing the house.</p>
<p>'A little foggy, isn't it?'</p>
<p>Kitty Delaney came close to him. There was a faint scent
of--what? Violets? Who was this little man, so small, so dapper,
but his neat blue suit rather shiny? Her heart was moved by the
anxious brown eyes, the mouth that trembled ever so slightly.</p>
<p>'I have been paying a New Year call on Lady Helen Pake.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes. Aren't they darlings? We are so glad they live
here.'</p>
<p>Claude felt from her, as he felt from the girl's father and
mother when he met them in the hall or on the stairs, a renewal
of his ebbing vitality. How charming a girl! Something pleasant
for him to think over alone in his room that evening. . . .</p>
<p>'I live quite close by.'</p>
<p>'Oh, do you? . . .' She took him, as it were, under her care
and protection. 'I'm so glad you do. All of us here--just in
these few streets. It's like living in a village, don't you
think? We all ought to know one another.'</p>
<p>'My name's Willoughby. Claude Willoughby, The Pakes will tell
you all about me. They've known me all my life.'</p>
<p>'How do you do, Mr. Willoughby?'</p>
<p>Kitty held out her hand. Claude held it a moment. How warm it
was beneath the glove! And was not the scent lilac? At any rate
he could smell lilac, his favourite flower, white or purple,
clusters of it--against the old dark wood of the stair.</p>
<p>'Well, I must be going on. Good afternoon, Miss Delaney.'</p>
<p>'Good-bye, Mr. Willoughby. You must come and visit <i>us</i>
one day as you know the house so well.'</p>
<p>'Indeed I will, Miss Delaney. Thank you so very much.'</p>
<p>He went tripping out into the fog, which by now had thickened.
But he hummed a little tune as he felt his way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c103" id="c103">CHAPTER III</a></h1>
<h2>MOTHER AND DAUGHTER: TWO MEETINGS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Meg Delaney's nature was often childlike and even childish.
Indeed, as I have already said, the Delaneys <i>were</i> on
occasion childish and were sometimes patronized by persons who
considered themselves more mature.</p>
<p>Meg herself was never aware of being patronized; too many
things were always happening for her to notice patronage. Certain
people alarmed her a little, like a friend of Kitty's called Joe
Cardinal who wrote for the paper <i>Life and Leisure</i>--a
journal owned, edited and written for by ladies who despised men
and womenly women--but then Meg was always alarmed by writers.
When Joe Cardinal came to a meal in Charles Street, Meg talked a
little too much, laughed a little too gaily and agreed rather too
eagerly that popular writers like Messrs. Adrian and Rose were
too awful for words; not that she had ever read them. She didn't
read books, partly because there seemed no time, but also
because, as soon as she began to read, things, people, memories,
flashes of sun, a cry, a whirr of the clock, the colour of a
flower, a stiffness in the leg, a laugh, a bell <i>would</i>
break in. She was a little of a coward with all women who did
things for a living, because she thought they must despise her
who did nothing at all. Also there was no doubt but that as soon
as a woman did something for a living she was changed a little.
Something was added to her personality, something detracted from
it. Add two waistcoat-buttons, subtract one blush of the cheek.
Meg, like her daughter, was preoccupied almost entirely with
individuals. She saw the world as peopled with individuals and
therefore she could never understand politics or world causes.
She saw Mussolini as Mussolini--<i>Mr.</i> Mussolini having a
bath, asking why his egg at breakfast wasn't fresh, chucking his
ferocious-looking daughter under the chin. When she learned that
Hitler had been a house-painter, when she realized that he really
intended to keep that ridiculous-looking moustache, she could
never take him seriously again and thought of him as someone who
needed poultices, Kruschen salts and warm underclothing. She
learnt that her views on politics seemed to her friends very
silly, so she kept silent about them as well as she could. There
were other things about which she said as little as possible. For
example, that she liked to go to church. This seemed to all her
friends a sign of imbecility--because if she went to church she
could have no brains at all. Queerly enough, had she been a Roman
Catholic her intelligence would not have been accused. This she
did not even begin to try and understand. The fact was that she
liked to go to church and so she went. She did all the things
that made her happy and interfered with other people's happiness
as little as possible, but she did not think about anything very
consciously. She moved and acted by instinct.</p>
<p>Now on this lovely afternoon, very early in the
adventure-seeking New Year, she was going with her daughter Kitty
as far as Hanover Square where Kitty had a dressmaker. After this
she would probably walk in the Park.</p>
<p>She delighted to walk out with her daughter because she was so
very proud of her. She knew of mothers, like Jessie Pinot for
instance, who would rather die than be seen out with their
daughters because of the age that it made them. But she, Meg
Delaney, did not care of what age anything made her, and indeed
looked forward quite eagerly to being a very old lady still able
to enjoy a theatre. Herself and Kitty had almost exactly the same
appreciation of small events and unexpected persons, and this
made a walk delightful. Meg, of course, attracted attention in
the streets because of her gay colours and large size, but for
some reason she was never absurd. She wore large hats, flowing
cloaks of dark red, dull gold, purple, and with her fine
carriage, dark eyes and high colouring looked what Princess
Corleone ought to look--that 'miserable little scratching hen of
a thing' as Millie Pake called her. Kitty was tall also, and the
pair of them floating down Bond Street was a fine sight.</p>
<p>Just at Agnew's door they encountered Marjorie Blandin. Lady
Marjorie Blandin, related to all the best families and descended
on every side from Ethelred the Unready, was a stout,
mottle-faced lady whose work in life was to take out obscure
girls in the 'Season' and be paid for it. She hadn't herself a
penny, but she knew everybody and was physically indefatigable,
so her prices were high. It was, however, a 'dog's life,' as she
explained now outside Agnew's, where there was very little room
on the pavement.</p>
<p>'A dog's life, darling--how sweet you're looking, Kitty! Well,
I think I've got those two Glowrie girls and a fat price too.
Mama was all right. She'd pay anything to get her little ones
through the hoops. But Papa--what a man! And the girls. Plain!
Quite frightful--and he insists on <i>everything</i>--Ascot,
Cowes, the Beaminster Dance. However, money's no object
and--well, dear, I must be moving. Tell Larry when you see him
that Gladys Dorington has some Tang horses that are real
treasures. Hoopy would have a fit if he knew she was selling
them, but she's counting on his not noticing they're gone. Bring
anyone to lunch any day, she says. Just ring up. Well,
darling--'</p>
<p>'That reminds me,' Kitty said as they moved forward. 'I met
the dearest little man in our hall two or three days ago. He'd
been visiting Millie and Helen.'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear.'</p>
<p>'<i>Why</i> did Marjorie Blandin remind me? . . . Oh yes, I
know--because she looks so very well fed. This little man looked
as though he was half-starved. His clothes were shabby too. But
he might have been King of England, the dignity he had. A very
old friend of Millie and Helen. He lives in Shepherd Market.'</p>
<p>Her mother interrupted unexpectedly.</p>
<p>'Do you like Alice Van Renn, darling?'</p>
<p>'No, I don't.'</p>
<p>'Nor do I. I was quite vexed with Larry for bringing her in on
New Year's morning. I can't see with the best will in the world
<i>why</i> she appeals to men.'</p>
<p>They negotiated the traffic and turned aside up Conduit
Street.</p>
<p>'It's because she never says anything.'</p>
<p>'Oh, do men like that?'</p>
<p>'Some men do.'</p>
<p>'Well, I've talked too much all my life and I've been liked by
a good many men one way and another. Darling, are you going to be
<i>extravagant</i> at the dressmaker's?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not.' Kitty laughed. 'But I'd <i>love</i> to
be.'</p>
<p>'I hope you're not, because I <i>believe</i> we're very poor
at the moment. Your father woke up in the middle of last night
and laughed like anything. When I asked what it was, he said that
he saw us engaging a barrel-organ and a monkey very shortly and
wouldn't we do it well? I said I wouldn't mind in the least, and
neither I would. I don't mind anything so long as we're all well.
But what I want to know'--Meg stopped for a while and gazed at
the shops--'is <i>who</i> has all the money? Because a lot of
money there is somewhere. Now, for instance, that woman Marjorie
Blandin was talking about will pay anything to get her daughters
on, while we--'</p>
<p>'It's changed hands, I suppose,' Kitty said. 'It's always
changing.'</p>
<p>'I've never had any,' Meg said cheerfully. 'Never my whole
life long. And I must say I haven't minded.'</p>
<p>As they turned into Hanover Square they were both conscious of
the sky. In the life of any Londoner the sky plays little part,
but, on occasion, it is as though the houses retire, as rocks
draw back when the ship moves out into the open sea. Then
buildings and streets dwindle into nothingness, or a kind of
wreckage that the sky has flung down. If clouds are flying, the
surface of the earth, with its scattering of bricks, mortar, and
pigmy figures, is scaled and bared as saucers and cups are
tumbled off a table by the dragging of a cloth. Light flashes
between clouds contemptuously on to the huddle of rubbish men
have gathered here.</p>
<p>But now, above the Square, although the wind drove the clouds
there was no anger nor contempt. The clouds were small and light,
misted with an orange glow because there was fog about on this
early January afternoon; the mist was in the small fleecy rounded
clouds that drove forward like tufts blowing in the breeze from
some divine daisy. But the fog did not touch the pale limpid blue
of the real sky-flood, which was clear and infinitely pure.</p>
<p>The orange light touched the chimney-pots and roofs with a
spreading thin gauze of shadow. The light fell in ladders to the
street as it does when the sun shines on a dusty room. The sky
was so alive with colour and movement that the town itself seemed
to crouch, as though watching on its knees, eyes staring upward
at the life and splendour.</p>
<p>Already dark shadows were clutching the knees of the
buildings, so that in the heavens all was glowing and on earth
there was half-obscurity. The orange light became with every
moment more intense as the little clouds began to be hustled by
the wind into a gathered company as a shepherd hustles sheep.</p>
<p>Kitty, gazing for a moment upwards, felt, once more, that
beating excitement of expectation. 'Something is going to happen
to me. . . . I have been waiting for years. . . .'</p>
<p>'What a lovely sky!' Meg said. 'I think I'll have an hour in
the Park. It will be light there for a long time yet.'</p>
<p>'All right, darling. Don't be picked up by a strange man. And
be back for tea. Connie Beaminster's bringing a friend.'</p>
<p>Meg laughed. 'You know, still, old as I am, I never take a
walk anywhere without thinking something <i>may</i> happen. . .
.'</p>
<p>She started off, a ship in full sail.</p>
<p>Kitty looked round for her dressmaker. As always the Church
dominated the Square. So many absurd, wicked, greedy, snobbish,
idle, wasteful marriages! And perhaps some good ones. But now all
was very still there. Some sparrows were hopping from one step to
another. Light had been falling on the pillars, but even as Kitty
looked it was switched away as though by an impatient hand. Her
dressmaker's was below the Church on the same side, near an Art
Gallery. She stayed for a moment to look in the little window of
this, for there was a picture of the kind that she didn't
understand at all--a white curling thing with black edges in the
middle, two purple blobs that might be fruit or mightn't,
something brown that looked like a broken violin, and squares and
slabs of colour, silver, dark brown and black. Fastened to the
picture was a label with the word 'Braque,' whether the title of
the picture or the name of the painter she didn't know. 'Now
<i>what,'</i> she thought, 'is the use of <i>that?</i> Why
shouldn't you paint fruit like fruit and violins like
violins?'--and yet as she looked she was aware that the colours
formed a pattern and that they were exquisitely painted. Such
deep and glowing silver she had never seen, and, in a mysterious
fashion beyond her understanding, the picture bore a closer
relation to the shining sky and the dark walls of the Church than
it would have done had it been an exact reproduction. Then she
saw, next to the little Gallery, an Art-shop over whose window
was painted in big silver letters: 'ZANTI LTD.' She had been to
her dressmaker's often enough but had never before seen this
name. It was as though, in these moments, extra vision was given
to her, she was seeing everything with redoubled intensity,
colours were twice-times rich and the dusk was deep, like
forest-dark, about her.</p>
<p>Set in the middle of Zanti's window was a rose-coloured bowl.
There were also some ivory-coloured figures, a triptych of
Limoges enamel and a piece of old rose and gold embroidered
cloth. She stared at the bowl: its design was simple and the
colour wavered like sunset on water. Of course it was absurd. She
could not remotely afford such a thing. But it would be pleasant
to enquire. She entered the shop. The full glow of the sky,
streaming in over the short buildings on the other side of the
street, illuminated it. It was a small shop but held, as Kitty
perceived, a number of beautiful things.</p>
<p>There was a young man behind the counter.</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon--' He looked at her gravely. He was a pale
young man with black hair, dark eyes.</p>
<p>Kitty, feeling very tall and as though she had no right to be
there when she knew that she could afford no purchase, said:</p>
<p>'No. It's nothing. I shouldn't trouble you. But the
rose-coloured bowl in the window. Might I look at it?'</p>
<p>'Of course, madam. No trouble at all.' He drew back the
curtain of the window, and while he leant forward she realized
that he was very thin and little more than a boy. He returned
with the bowl in his hands. 'Do you mean this, madam?'</p>
<p>'Oh no. It was--yes, I suppose I do.' She was examining it.
All the colour seemed to have gone from it. 'Why--now--it isn't
rose-coloured. I thought--'</p>
<p>'Probably the sun was shining on it. Things often look
different in the window. It is a very old bowl. We have had it in
the shop a great many years. It is Italian fifteenth-century--Mr.
Zanti was very proud of it, I believe. I don't know because I
never saw Mr. Zanti.'</p>
<p>Kitty put down the bowl very carefully.</p>
<p>'Thank you very much. I had no right to bother you, because I
knew I couldn't begin to afford anything so beautiful.'</p>
<p>She smiled and the young man smiled. He had a smile so
attractive, so friendly, intelligent and shy, that Kitty herself
continued to smile.</p>
<p>'If you would only wait a minute or two, Mr. Zimmerman will be
back. If there were anything else--'</p>
<p>'Mr. Zimmerman?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Mr. Zimmerman owns the shop. Mr. Zimmerman and his son.
They bought it from Mr. Zanti and kept the name because he was
well known. I am only the assistant,' he added. He was so very
thin: did he have enough to eat? she wondered. 'I haven't been
here very long,' he went on, 'and I always prefer it when Mr.
Zimmerman is in. I might make a mistake.'</p>
<p>'You won't with me,' Kitty said cheerfully. 'Because I can't
afford to buy anything.'</p>
<p>They were staring into one another's faces as though they were
asking one another questions. The Italian bowl lay between
them.</p>
<p>'Then you haven't been doing this always?'</p>
<p>'Oh no. I've been many different things.'</p>
<p>'Do you like this?'</p>
<p>'Mr. Zimmerman is very kind, but I'm so afraid of breaking
something or mistaking values. Of course all the prices are
marked, but everything here is so precious.'</p>
<p>'Do you like beautiful things?' she asked.</p>
<p>'Oh, I <i>like</i> things. Anybody would. But the world being
what it is! If you only knew how much some of these cost! And so
many people haven't enough to live on.'</p>
<p>'You'd rather do something else?'</p>
<p>'I'd like to be out of doors. I'd rather garden than anything.
I love flowers.'</p>
<p>'Yes, so do I.'</p>
<p>'And the mountains and the sea,' he added.</p>
<p>'Can't you go away, then? Are you married? Does anything
prevent you?'</p>
<p>It was nothing unusual for one of the Delaneys to enter into
conversation with a stranger; ask questions and be asked them. At
the same time Kitty thought the young man's voice, eyes and smile
so very oddly personal to herself, as though she had asked for
someone with just that delicacy and friendliness to be found for
her. And lo, he was there!</p>
<p>'I am tied rather,' he said, his eyes on her face. 'My father
is paralysed. I have a sister who looks after him, but I have to
make what I can for us all.'</p>
<p>'Paralysed! How terrible!'</p>
<p>'It isn't really. My father is very happy, although moving his
head is about all he can do. He was a builder and fell from a
roof and injured his spine. But he's like no one else in the
world--no one anywhere.'</p>
<p>'Wouldn't it be better for him if you lived in the
country?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps it would.'</p>
<p>'Would you think me impertinent?' She paused, but, looking him
in the eyes again, realized that he would think nothing
impertinent from her. 'If you were to give me your name and
address I might hear of something. One does sometimes.' She felt
in her case. 'Here is <i>my</i> card.'</p>
<p>He said nothing, but out of a drawer produced one of the
firm's cards, wrote on it and gave it to her.</p>
<p>'That's my name--Alton Foster. And my address.' He took her
card and put it in his pocket without looking at it. He was
suddenly formal. But she held out her hand. She felt the thin
warm texture of his hand through her glove. She smiled. 'Good
evening.'</p>
<p>'Good evening, madam. And thank you.' She turned near the
door. He was standing there staring at her.</p>
<p>'Please forgive me . . . if my questions . . .'</p>
<p>He went to the door and opened it for her. 'Don't lose the
card,' he said in an urgent, trembling whisper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meg Delaney engaged a taxi. This was wrong of her when only
last night Fred had told her how poor they were. She knew that it
was wrong, but she wanted to have all her time in that light,
under that sky, in the open freedom of Regent's Park.</p>
<p>She told the man to drive to the Botanical Gardens and then
sat straight up, looking out at the sky and feeling very
happy.</p>
<p>She should <i>not</i> be happy, because in the first place she
should have walked to Oxford Street, only a step, and taken an
omnibus (although she could walk it <i>all</i> in <i>no</i>
time!), and secondly, Fred had, she knew perfectly well, begun a
flirtation with Alice Van Renn. However, poverty and Fred's
flirtations were no new things, which was possibly the reason why
she did not feel as unhappy as she should. Hundreds and hundreds
of times Fred had flirted, and possibly hundreds and hundreds of
times Fred had been unfaithful. But <i>how</i> young had Meg been
when for the first time she had learnt that there was one law for
the woman, quite another for the man! About six years old,
perhaps. She had at least been very young indeed when that
hateful Mrs. Delias came and stayed so often in that little
Clarges Street house and gave her sweets and took her into her
bed with her.</p>
<p>She knew that she had with Fred a bond so strong and deep that
no woman born of man could disturb it. And she wanted Fred to be
happy, as indeed she wanted everyone to be happy. And healthy
strong men in their middle years had certain problems to solve.
She knew all this and allowed for it. But she must be honest with
herself and would confess then that Alice Van Renn and her greedy
old mother gave her the creeps.</p>
<p>It was this creepiness that ought to cause Meg uneasiness,
because there was altogether something wrong in a fine healthy
man like Fred flirting with a beautiful young corpse like Alice.
Meg now unexpectedly burst out laughing inside the cab because,
in the very middle of Oxford Street traffic, a Sealyham puppy on
the end of a lead had sat down four-square, refusing the urgent
solicitations of a stout man who held in the other hand a
tissue-paper carton containing flowers. The man looked
exquisitely absurd, being of all things in the world the most
ridiculous, an Englishman who hated to be made a fool of in
public. Such a very small puppy, such a very stout man! It was
always thus: at the moment when you should be seriously upset
about something life provided an irresistible incongruity. It was
like dear Graham Pender, slipping on the icy path at Strathpeffer
and falling on his behind, just when he was bending forward to
kiss her. Dear Graham! How adorable he had been all those years
ago when she, nineteen and divinely beautiful, had stayed that
winter with Aunt Grace Linklater in Scotland! They had been
engaged, Graham and she, for four whole months, and no one had
known it, and then off to China he had gone, years had passed,
she had married, <i>he</i> had married. . . . Well, well . . . to
think of it, and that night after the dance at the Wotherspoons'
they had so nearly, so very, very nearly . . . Only a miracle had
saved her, a miracle and Graham's untimely sense of the
incongruous. Meg's eyes were misted. The Queen's Hall swam in a
vague of tenderness. Dear Graham! She had never loved anyone in
quite the same way again: Fred <i>more,</i> perhaps, but not in
<i>quite</i> the same way. And if she had married Graham there
would not have been either Kitty or Bullock. Where would
<i>they</i> have been? And what would Graham's children have been
like? Tall and spare with high cheekbones and very, very
intelligent.</p>
<p>The taxi stopped at the entrance to the Botanical Gardens and
Meg got out, stepping at once into a blaze of light and colour
made personal and poignant by a touch of frosty air.</p>
<p>'Thank you very much,' she said to the driver.</p>
<p>He was an old man with a white powder-coloured nose, rheumy
eyes and a large grey woollen comforter.</p>
<p>'What a lovely afternoon!' she said.</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.' He leaned towards her as though he would confide
an important secret. 'I've got a shocking cold,' he said.</p>
<p>'I'm so sorry. What are you doing for it?'</p>
<p>'Five o'clock my time's up. I'm going straight 'ome and put my
feet in mustard and water.'</p>
<p>'Yes, you do,' she said, nodding her head confidentially.
'That's an excellent thing.' As she walked along the Inner Circle
she wondered as to his home, his family and his general comforts.
Was he as poor as they, the Delaneys, were? He was sure, in all
probability, of his food and his bed.</p>
<p>In positive fact the Delaneys were sure of neither. Forced out
of Charles Street, where would they go? Oh! there were plenty who
would take them in! But it wouldn't be their own beds or their
own food. Fred would of course get work. But what would he do,
what <i>could</i> he do in this new world where, if you were not
efficient at something, you were lost? Why was the world so
over-full of people now? It hadn't been in her younger days. Ever
since the Great War, in which millions of people had been killed,
the world had been overcrowded. How very odd! She was walking on
grass now and before her rose a sloping green hill canopied with
a sky of rose and blue that the increasing cold seemed to
crystallize. Children were running, dogs were barking, the bare
tree-trunks gave off, as it seemed to her, a kind of smoke, of
faintly amber shadow. Yes, the sun was sinking. She climbed the
little hill, found two small children crying because they refused
to go home, and stood face to face with Graham Pender.</p>
<p>She knew him at once. Year melting into year had not changed
him. She could see him at this moment, here on this hill, bending
forward to kiss her, his feet slipping, his little cry of dismay.
. . . He was standing very still, looking at the rosy sky.</p>
<p>'Well, Graham,' she said.</p>
<p>He turned as though he had been shot. He stared.</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon.'</p>
<p>'I'm Meg Wendover.'</p>
<p>Colour flashed into his brown, thin and <i>very</i>
distinguished face.</p>
<p>'Meg!'</p>
<p>'Yes, I'm Meg. I recognized you at once.'</p>
<p>He shot out his hand, caught hers, and then held it, staring
and staring. His hand was trembling.</p>
<p>'Meg! Meg! Meg!' he said over and over.</p>
<p>She was herself so greatly excited that she put her other hand
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>'Dear Graham! How enchanting! Although I should of course
really be angry. I wrote last--over twenty years ago. Not a word
since.' She took both her hands back to herself and tried to be
dignified.</p>
<p>'Often and often I've wanted to,' he began eagerly. (His eyes
were as bright and blue as they had ever been, his height as
commanding, his forehead as noble!) 'But I saw in the paper that
you married, and I seemed destined for the East for ever and
ever, and I . . . I married too and--and--'</p>
<p>'Don't explain anything.' They began to walk down the hill.
'Of course you married. What woman could resist you? And I saw
that you had been knighted. And your books are famous and so
clever that no one can understand them. And you are just the
same. Years haven't made the slightest difference to you.'</p>
<p>'My hair's white,' taking off his bowler hat. Yes, it was, and
with his blue eyes, brown colour, tall, slim, erect body, made
him more beautiful than ever!</p>
<p>'Put on your hat. You'll catch cold. Tell me everything.'</p>
<p>He laughed. It was plain that he was delighted indeed to see
her.</p>
<p>'My wife and I have come to England to live. Surbiton. I'm up
for two days. I want to see the English pictures at Burlington
House. We are going to Marie Tempest to-night--<i>Old Folks At
Home.'</i></p>
<p>He told her everything in exactly the direct boyish way that
he had done--when?--was it only yesterday?</p>
<p>'Oh dear, I'm so glad we met! And I felt that something would
happen--I knew it! I knew it!'</p>
<p>'And you?'</p>
<p>'I'm Mrs. Delaney. We live in Charles Street and have two
children. And I've got fat.'</p>
<p>'No. No, you haven't. You look superb--and somehow a child
still.'</p>
<p>A thin little woman wearing an ugly hat so that she reminded
Meg of a penwiper was coming across the grass toward them.</p>
<p>'This is my wife,' he said. 'I walked up the hill to look at
the sky. Evie, this is an old friend of mine, Meg Delaney. We
knew each other in Scotland when we were very, very young.'</p>
<p>(Evie, thought Meg. What a ridiculous name for her!)</p>
<p>'How do you do, Lady Pender?' Meg said. 'How do you do? An old
friend. How very agreeable!'</p>
<p>They walked to the Inner Circle, talking about Marie
Tempest.</p>
<p>'I don't care for the theatre,' Lady Pender said. 'But my
husband enjoys it. It makes it so very late returning to
Surbiton.'</p>
<p>'What does it matter! We only live once!' said Graham.</p>
<p>'We do indeed,' said Meg joyfully, 'and must make the most of
every minute.' She stopped a taxi. 'Now that is my address
and--wait a moment--that is our telephone number, although it
<i>is</i> in the book.'</p>
<p>'I think I have a card.' He felt for his pocket-book. 'Yes,
here it is.'</p>
<p>They looked one another for an instant in the eyes. Then he
took off his hat, gave a little bow and led Lady Pender away.</p>

<h1><a name="c104" id="c104">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>
<h2>FIGURES IN RAIN</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Half Moon Street on a rainy afternoon in January has little
aspect of beauty. It is true that to-day it has
respectability--more than could be claimed for it even twenty
years ago. Mr. Dare and Mr. Dolphin blaze and shimmer at the
entrance as much as to say: 'Here are shirts, ties and
dressing-gowns so superb that, try as it may, Half Moon Street
won't, after you've looked into our window, be able to disappoint
you.' And the tobacconist, opposite Mr. Dare and Mr. Dolphin,
shows you pipes so beautiful that, slender of purse as you are,
you wish that Sir Walter Raleigh had never been born. There are
gay bachelors, too, in 90 Piccadilly--gay and at the same time
serious, responsible, knowing as they do that they are under the
benevolent but autocratic supervision of John Jones, master of
all gentlemen's servants; morals and patriotism go, at this
address, hand in hand with the rent.</p>
<p>Abutting on Number 90, moreover, there is a staid but elegant
Club whose members constantly place their cars at the very
portals of Number 90 to the aggravation of the aforesaid moral
bachelors. All this is very well, and so far Half Moon Street has
nothing to be ashamed of. Nor is there any very evident change as
you advance. Excellent landlords, admirable landladies, bright
fires seen between the curtains, cats, sleeker than the common or
garden, rubbing their backs against area railings, a geranium or
so, a glimpse of 'The Stag at Bay' above the friendly bookcase, a
gentleman's gentleman, bareheaded, wearing a stiff white collar
and side-whiskers as though he were even now in the service of
Major Pendennis, two bottles of milk, twin innocents, still on
the doorstep, two young men delivering a table, a bassinet and a
rocking-horse, a window high in the sky suddenly opening and a
gentleman with a teapot in his hand calling out 'Paper!', a stout
man in a bowler hat leading two Pekinese, authority, disgust, and
a simple touching kind of loneliness fighting for victory on his
pale and very unintelligent countenance; here is the life of Half
Moon Street on any afternoon in the week. 'On tiptoe for flight,'
you might imitate Mr. Keats by calling it, for it will not remain
as it is much longer. There is ghostly scaffolding about the
houses and the
smoky-dusty-carpet-geranium-smelling-iron-bedstead-basement-toastmaking-damp-washing
period is nearly over and ended. It doesn't matter in the least,
the number of the house where Mrs. Van Renn and her daughter
Alice had their abode. Their rooms were on the middle floor--two
bedrooms, bath- and sitting-room, meals sent up to order, service
and electric light and coal extra.</p>
<p>The house must not be numbered here because, to tell the
truth, it was a very poor, frowsty and uncomfortable house. Mrs.
Van Renn took the rooms last year because the rent was low and
the address good. It was one of her final desperate moves to get
Alice off her hands, because if Alice didn't marry money soon
they'd be in the poorhouse. Mrs. Van Renn, it must be confessed,
was very ugly, being more like a monkey than most monkeys manage
to be, nor was she in any way an attractive character, but she
adored her only child, although she was desperately afraid of
her. If she <i>did</i> marry her off she would be so lonely an
old woman that suicide would be the only way out; on the other
hand, if she <i>didn't</i> marry her off, why, then they would
die in the gutter. So there you were!</p>
<p>Alice herself expressed no opinion in the matter. She didn't
care in the least what happened to her. That men were fascinated
by her, her mother knew; that they never proposed marriage to her
was also a fact.</p>
<p>'Why don't they, Alice?'</p>
<p>'I've no idea, Mama.'</p>
<p>'You give in to them too readily.'</p>
<p>'I don't give in to them at all.'</p>
<p>'Well, perhaps you ought to.'</p>
<p>'I don't want to be married, Mama.'</p>
<p>'Then we starve. That's all. We positively starve.'</p>
<p>'I'd rather starve than be married.'</p>
<p>'Then what about me?'</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, Mama, but you should never have allowed Papa to
put our money in those mines.'</p>
<p>'I didn't know. I never knew <i>what</i> your father was
doing.'</p>
<p>On an afternoon of driving rain Half Moon Street is really on
the shabby side. Its resentment at bad weather is to be felt in
all its bones: rheumatism, a sentimental melancholy for the past,
and a waterproof that has known better days. Half Moon Street
aches from head to toe; Mr. Dare and Mr. Dolphin give one look
out of the window and for that afternoon at least decide that
their residence is in Piccadilly.</p>
<p>Fred Delaney, seated on an uncomfortable chair in the Van Renn
sitting-room, wished that he had not come. He had intended
<i>not</i> to. He would write some letters, go and talk to the
Pakes, wait finally for Meg to return from her visit to some old
friends she had discovered who lived, of all inaccessible
rainy-day places, in Surbiton.</p>
<p>Then the flesh had pricked as it is given to doing on a rainy
day in London. A vision of Alice Van Renn's exquisite white neck
hung, like a materialization of ectoplasm, right in front of the
William and Mary clock. He didn't <i>want</i> it to be there. He
turned his eyes away from it, but it followed him and in some
mysterious way affected his stomach. It was exactly the same
sensation as when, a small boy with no pocket-money, he had gazed
in at a pastry-cook's window. Not a very worthy reason for
visiting Miss Van Renn; and, through the rain, stopping to buy an
evening paper from the newsman who stood beside Miss Bonda's
archway, he cursed himself for a weak self-indulgent
Irishman.</p>
<p>Inside the Van Renn castle, he decided, as he had already
several times decided, that the girl was a complete fool. He
tried her with the theatre. Did she like pantomimes? Had she seen
<i>Babes in the Wood</i> and George Mozart?</p>
<p>'Oh, I never go to pantomimes.'</p>
<p>'No . . . well, not by yourself of course. But it's fun to
take children.'</p>
<p>'Oh, do you think so? Children always behave so badly when
they are with me.'</p>
<p>Yes, they would, of course. They'd <i>hate</i> her. He was
aware then, as tea was being brought in by a girl who had plucked
eyebrows and was heavily powdered, he was aware, for the first
time, that Mrs. Van Renn didn't like him. Fred was not vain, but
he did think that he was a big, jolly Irish gentleman and
agreeable to most people. He had set out from the beginning to be
charming to Mrs. Van Renn because of her beautiful daughter, and
now all his efforts were wasted.</p>
<p>He didn't know, of course, that Mrs. Van Renn looked now on
any male admirer of Alice's who was unable to offer her marriage
as a danger. He didn't realize either that Mrs. Van Renn found
him physically most attractive and that when she thought that of
any man a sense of isolation and misery attacked her; for she was
an ugly brown-faced old woman and she knew it. Thirdly, he did
not know that Mrs. Van Renn realized that her daughter was
attracted also by this man, and that that was a rare and alarming
portent.</p>
<p>He did know, however, that the tea was stewed, the madeira
cake something only fit for the laundry, and the bread and butter
faded and weary.</p>
<p>Alice got up and stood by the window, staring out at the rain.
Then she turned and looked at Delaney. The faintest hint of
colour touched her cheek. She was dressed in a very simple black
frock. She was so thin and so pale and her features were so
lovely and her body was so remote that he lowered his head and
gazed at the carpet. For a wonder she spoke.</p>
<p>'On a day like this in a street like this, Mr. Delaney, don't
you long for a gas-oven?'</p>
<p>'Really, Alice!'</p>
<p>'Well, of course, Mama. . . . It's the sensible thing. Only I
haven't the courage.'</p>
<p>'No, I can't say that I do.' Fred looked at her hands. 'After
all it won't rain for ever.'</p>
<p>The impulse to get up and take her in his arms, there, in
front of her old mother, was insane and almost irresistible. It
was then that he was aware of the danger that he was in. It was a
sharp warning, coming from within himself. 'Get up and go! Go and
never come back.' He did get up.</p>
<p>'I must be going, I'm afraid.'</p>
<p>He held out his hand and it enclosed Alice's. She was drawn a
little closer to him. Her hand was warm when he had expected it
to be cold.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Renn said: 'Oh, must you go? It's early yet.' She had
a habit of bending and twisting her thin brown fingers
together.</p>
<p>He said to Alice: 'You must come to a theatre some night.'</p>
<p>'Thanks. I'd love to.'</p>
<p>The room was stifling and his heart was hammering.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Renn said: 'So nice to have seen you.'</p>
<p>As he went downstairs he was aware that he was carrying the
scent of the room with him. There must have been, he thought, gas
escaping somewhere; there was a smell of airlessness and as
though a trap had been set baited with cheese and a mouse had
been caught in it some while back.</p>
<p>He must walk. He must clear his head of the mouse-trap,
Alice's white neck. He must investigate this new and unaccustomed
sense of danger.</p>
<p>He started down the Green Park. Just a short round to the
Palace, Hyde Park Corner and back. The rain curled and coiled
about him like a great spider's-web. On an afternoon like this
the London that he loved disappeared and became as indistinct as
the blurred film in a cinematograph. It had no character, no
place, no past nor present.</p>
<p>In and out of the rain figures were constantly moving, but
figures like germs in a medical chart. This was because, he often
thought (for he studied London and all its moods with constant
delight), under storm and rain London was not a city, but rather
gladly returned to its original marsh-world. He had noticed how a
bird flying through the air on a rainy day in London seemed
gigantic, portentous, masterful, how men and women shrank to
non-identity, and the long stretch of Piccadilly covered with the
motionless wet-gleaming cars and omnibuses was like a river of
mud and slime between rocky barriers. When the rain, as to-day,
was clinging and web-like, and the chill air wrapped you in damp
underclothing, he rushed to some interior, for once be within
walls on a London wet day and you were twice as comforted,
consoled and reassured as you would be in any other place. It was
as though on every side of you fortresses had been planted
against the enemy. Once inside, you could, from the warmth,
light, security, look out and mock the marshes and the gleaming
dark-running river, the gigantic birds, the quagmires and the
prehistoric beasts.</p>
<p>To-day, however, he realized that his attraction to Alice Van
Renn belonged to the marshes and the gigantic bird. There is a
world of physical passion which has no contact anywhere with
common sense, morality, thought for others, friendship, nobility
of character. All that you can say to a man is that he must keep
out of it, for once he has crossed the border and breathed its
unnatural air he will not listen to any warning voices, any
threats of public disgrace or private hell, any stern implication
of the law. That is why one is so often astonished by bizarre,
macabre, abnormal occurrences revealed suddenly, planted there in
the normal, colourless life of man like bright exotic poisonous
flowers.</p>
<p>Delaney's attraction to Alice Van Renn was not as yet mature
enough to seem so portentous, but, walking now in the rain, he
realized quite clearly that it might become so, that it belonged
to that crazy, dangerous world, that it was a sort of fever in
the blood that led to deliriums, sleep-walkings, and acts that
were destructive, without reward, comfortless.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that he had been beguiled by the
flesh, but he had hoped that these crazy, inevitably
disappointing episodes were beginning to fade from his life. For
he liked to be kind, jolly, generous and honest, and he loved Meg
with all his heart and soul.</p>
<p>Then, with a flash, he realized that he was attracted to Alice
Van Renn partly because she was, in physical type, the exact
opposite of his wife. He was attracted sensually by the spare,
the delicate, the remote, the silent. He had loved Meg
passionately, he had passion for her still, but for some reason
women of her type had always been easy of conquest for him. They
had liked his health and sturdiness and joyfulness as he had
liked theirs. He looked on Alice Van Renn as a collector of
Chinese pottery sees a splendid horse in the Eumorfopoulos
Collection. Her power over him lay in her remoteness from
possession. That was why this obsession was so essentially
foolish. If he didn't get her he would be exasperated, and if he
did get her he would be disappointed. To all the other Figures in
the Rain he cried out: 'There is nothing in this but folly,
bitterness and unhappiness to others. Let's run from the marshes
to dry ground.' He shook his shoulders with relief when he found
himself safely once again within the walls of the Charles Street
house.</p>
<p>There was a message that Captain Pullet would like to see him
when he came in. He ran up the stairs, humming, feeling all the
old buoyancy, his physical fitness, his freedom from alarm.</p>
<p>'Well, Smoke, what's the trouble?'</p>
<p>'Have a drink.'</p>
<p>'Thanks, I will. Not too much whisky.'</p>
<p>'What a filthy day!'</p>
<p>'Yes, isn't it? I had a walk but it was nasty. Not the right
sort of rain. Glad to get in.'</p>
<p>'Smoke' Pullet was very trim, his face hollowed and sharp. He
looked an Army officer and a discontented one. Or rather the
puckered lines in his forehead stood for trouble more than
discontent. He had lost a leg in the War. The sitting-room of the
Pullets was furnished in the best modern fashion; the chairs had
arms of steel, the carpet had a design of black and white
squares, there was a Marie Laurencin lady in silver and pink over
the fireplace, the walls were white and the curtains black. Fred
Delaney thought the place hideous, but that was not his business.
He liked Smoke and Dodie immensely. He felt for them like a
father. He thought Smoke one of the bravest and least intelligent
men he had ever known. Dodie was clever, but Smoke had no brains
at all, only instincts. He had therefore been a great success in
the War and had been awarded both the D.S.O. and the M.C.</p>
<p>He was so honest, so courageous and so stupid that he was not
at all fitted for the economic storms that he was trying to
weather.</p>
<p>He looked at Delaney with great affection and said: 'I'm
sorry, old boy, but I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.'</p>
<p>'What's that?'</p>
<p>'It seems that Dodie and I will have to move. We are planning
to sleep on the Embankment. Dodie's out now seeing about a
pitch.'</p>
<p>This was what Fred had feared, but he showed no disturbance.
His cheerful countenance beamed on his friend.</p>
<p>'Stuff! Leave here? I should think not!'</p>
<p>'Oh, but it's so, old boy. You know that Dodie's been helping
Hazel Groom in her dressmaking place. Well, she's left. They had
an awful row. There's only my pension and we're up to our eyes in
debt. We simply can't afford even this rent.'</p>
<p>Delaney said nothing. He couldn't offer a lesser rent because
one penny less and the whole place went under.</p>
<p>'I think,' Smoke said slowly, 'that the best thing I can do is
to get out of this altogether.'</p>
<p>'Get out of it?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Bung off. Visit another world. Make a call on old Saint
Peter.'</p>
<p>'My dear chap--'</p>
<p>'Yes, I know all about it. I'm not very bright, you know, and
ideas move slowly. All the same, I get there in the end. Anyway,
lots of chaps are doing it. You read about one or other of them
every morning in the paper . . . and Dodie would be a lot better
without me. She'd marry again. She's darned attractive and some
smart feller would want her. Sure to.'</p>
<p>'You blithering fool,' Delaney said. 'She adores you.'</p>
<p>'Yes, she's fond of me. She's a good girl. She'd miss me a bit
at first and then she'd see what a good thing it was. This isn't
a world, old boy, for a chap with a wooden leg, no cash and no
brains.' Then he added slowly, staring in front of him: 'I've
tried for every sort of thing. Nobody wants me.'</p>
<p>Delaney was silent. He had a lot to think about.</p>
<p>'You've no idea, old boy, of the kind of life that Dodie and
I've been leading in the last year. We've cadged deliberately on
everybody we know. We've angled for meals, been everywhere and
anywhere with the chance of getting something for nothing. We've
spent days and nights with the most awful people to be safe for
food and drink. It can't go on for ever. For one thing, <i>we</i>
can't stand it. For another, I bore nearly everybody. There are
only a few old stupids like yourself can stand me. Almost all the
people we really like are as poor as we are. And that's another
reason I'd be better away. Dodie amuses them. She's bright and
gay. Without me she would have no end of a time. If I ever did
have any ideas they are gone now because my brain goes round and
round about the Bank worrying us and the debts and the rent and
the debts and the Bank. . . . So we must move out, old boy.
Sorry, but there's nothing else for it.'</p>
<p>Fred stretched his thick legs out, patted his stomach, pulled
at his tie, looked in front of him. Here was another Figure in
the Rain. Unless something happened Smoke would do just as he
said. And perhaps it would be the best thing for him. That was
the real problem at the heart of the trouble. There was no place
in this present world for the Smoke Pullets unless there was a
World War again--then they would be admirable.</p>
<p>Before 1914 they had played a very necessary part; they were a
real need in English life and had been so for centuries. They had
been the Squire and the Squire's son; some property, possibly a
seat in Parliament, beneficent, tyrannical, understanding in
their country community, conforming, traditional, safe and sound.
So it had been since the Wars of the Roses; from Agincourt 1415,
say, until Serajevo 1914. And now, within the space of twenty
years, they had become only a burden, and a wearisome burden at
that. There was no future of any kind for Smoke and he without a
leg which he had lost in the service of his country. Probably a
nice gas-oven (who had been talking of gas-ovens that very
afternoon?--oh yes! Miss Alice Van Renn!) <i>would</i> be the
best thing.</p>
<p>And yet Delaney had only to look at Smoke to know that he
would do anything in his power to help him--save only to lower
the rent. That he must not do for the sake of the house. The
house! The house! And then he heard Smoke saying:</p>
<p>'And the Pakes may have to do the same thing. Their income's
gone down like anything.'</p>
<p>So there it was! The battle had been joined!
Nineteen-thirty-four was already showing what she could do, and
January not ended! He realized from the start, however, that it
was Smoke with whom he had immediately to deal. Let him think of
the house afterwards! Over Smoke's thin obstinate face there was
a strange shadow as though he were half-way towards Saint Peter
already!</p>
<p>'Look here, Smoke--don't be a bloody fool. No, I mean it.
Killing yourself doesn't help anything. I'll speak to Rex Bennet,
in the War Office. He'll think of something. Great friend of
mine. And we'll manage about the rent. I've got to get it in
somehow because we're running on a narrow margin as it is. There
are so many things want doing to a house like this. You're right,
though, in one thing. Fellows like you and me who haven't been
brought up to doing anything particular aren't much use in this
new world. You've got to be <i>efficient</i> at something these
days if you're to get a job, and the public schools are still
turning out heaps of young chaps who aren't any more efficient
than we are. There are more young men hanging round London doing
nothing to their parents' despair than ever before, and they
don't want to do anything either. They've been to Eton or Harrow
or Winchester and think they're swell. They look down on
everybody, their parents first of all--and yet they're quite
incompetent. They don't give a damn for their country. Patriotism
is bunk, and so is religion and so is hard work. I don't like the
Fascists and the Nazis, but I will say they give their young men
something to be keen about. . . .'</p>
<p>The door opened and Dodie Pullet stood there, as smart and
thin and straight as a wand cut from the willow. Delaney, looking
at her, thought as he often thought: 'Where <i>do</i> they put
all their figure to? Nothing either in front or behind. It must
all be <i>somewhere.'</i></p>
<p>But he was extremely fond of Dodie. She came and kissed him,
ruffled his hair a little, and, in her mouse-grey frock with
carnation at the neck and wrist, stood, with her arm around her
husband's waist, looking very beautiful.</p>
<p>'Well, darling, have you told him?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I have.'</p>
<p>'And what does he say?'</p>
<p>'Oh, that it's all nonsense of course.'</p>
<p>'It isn't. Fred, sweet, we've got to go. That is unless I
become a woman of sin and spend a weekend with--oh, never mind
who! But I've had a very good offer.'</p>
<p>She was joking, she was talking nonsense, and yet the trouble
in Smoke's eyes ever so slightly deepened.</p>
<p>'Now, you two children,' said Delaney, getting up and
straddling on his strong legs. 'Leave it all to your uncle. He'll
think of something.'</p>
<p>'I don't know what it is about you Delaneys,' Dodie said. 'You
haven't any money yourselves and you none of you do anything for
a living and you aren't very intelligent and yet you <i>are</i> a
comfort. There's no denying it. You <i>are</i> a comfort. Someone
was calling you ironically the other night "the joyful Delaneys"
and saying they detested your good spirits. But I don't know.
It's as though you saw farther than the rest of us and knew there
was a good place <i>somewhere.</i> I like you. I must honestly
confess I like you. But you're getting fat, Fred. You must watch
out for it. The Hay Diet. That's the thing.'</p>
<p>Later in the evening, in the middle of his happiness, he
thought of the Pullets. But they were different now. Figures in
the Rain, but the rain was shut out, and all that marsh-world was
unreal. For, by an extraordinary piece of good fortune, all the
Delaneys were in that evening--Fred, Meg, Kitty and Bullock. Not
only did they all have dinner together, but they stayed together
<i>after</i> dinner, all of them, until they went up to bed. Of
how many families of their class in London that evening could
that be said? They had one of Fred's favourite dinners, as Meg
knew well--petite marmite, sole, mutton with currant jelly and
baked potatoes, and apple pudding.</p>
<p>'Americans shudder at our food,' Fred said. 'And yet, how
beautiful, how natural, how full of flavour. . . . Dodie Pullet
says I'm getting fat.'</p>
<p>He reflected that it was strange that they always seemed to
gather this happiness from one another. Trouble was brewing for
himself, Meg had something on her mind, and Kitty--hadn't, in the
last few days, something been happening to Kitty? but inside this
room, close together, loving one another, they were conscious,
perhaps, as Dodie said, of a happiness not dependent on the
events of the day or material things. . . . He didn't know. Food
and wine made him sentimental.</p>
<p>'And how was Surbiton?' he asked Meg.</p>
<p>For an instant--so swift that no one but he in the whole world
would have noticed it--she pulled up her guard. She looked at him
over the top of it with her large black eyes, as though she would
say: 'Are we moving into a new episode? Have I got to be
careful?' for no marriage, however long-lived, however intimately
enjoyed, is ever static. It changes colour, shape, balance of
strength and weakness with every striking of the hour. No one
knows anyone else sufficiently ever to be <i>certain</i> of
safety.</p>
<p>'Surbiton? . . . Oh dear, such a wet day! I walked up an
endless road. Just imagine! The house was called "Happy
Nook".'</p>
<p>'Called <i>what?'</i></p>
<p>'"Happy Nook." Really. Of course my friend hadn't named it. It
was like that when they took it.'</p>
<p>'Did you like them?'</p>
<p>'Of course it's funny after so long. The wife's a dowdy. He's
so very clever.'</p>
<p>'Ah, that must be a change after your own dear family.'</p>
<p>'And what have you been doing on this very wet day?'</p>
<p>'Oh, nothing . . . had a little walk in the rain . . . waited
for you to come back.'</p>
<p>Afterwards they sat in extreme comfort round the fire. Once
Kitty said:</p>
<p>'Anyone ever heard of a painter called Braque?'</p>
<p>'<i>Who,</i> darling?'</p>
<p>'Braque--B-r-a-q-u-e.'</p>
<p>'Lord, no! What a funny name!'</p>
<p>'I have,' Bullock said. 'Play you at backgammon, Kitty.'</p>
<p>'All right. What do you know about him?'</p>
<p>'Oh, he paints squares and cubes and nonsense like that. You
aren't going highbrow, my darling sister, are you?'</p>
<p>'Of course not. Why should I be highbrow just because I ask an
intelligent question?'</p>
<p>Bullock kissed her.</p>
<p>'You look very beautiful to-night, as though you were in love
or something.'</p>
<p>Meg tried to read a novel for a brief while. She put the book
down. 'I know I'm not clever,' she said, 'but I can't read modern
novels. If they're intelligent they're about the nastiest people
and take the gloomiest view of everything. If they're about nice
people and end well, they're stupid. What I want is an
<i>intelligent</i> happy novel. It's not much to ask.'</p>
<p>Later, from his very small dressing-room off their bedroom, he
called out:</p>
<p>'Meg!'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear.'</p>
<p>'What stage are you at?'</p>
<p>'I'm in bed.'</p>
<p>He came in, in a superb dressing-gown of black silk with a
purple collar and cuffs--a birthday present from Larry after he'd
made a lucky deal in some Waterford glass. Fred called it his
Waterford. He sprawled over his bed and drew her into his
arms.</p>
<p>'Meg, dear.'</p>
<p>'Yes. What is it?'</p>
<p>'I think I'm a little in love with the Van Renn girl.'</p>
<p>'I know you are.'</p>
<p>'And the Pullets and the Pakes may be leaving.'</p>
<p>'Oh dear, oh dear!'</p>
<p>'Yes--altogether I feel as though things are going to happen.
You're not quite yourself either.'</p>
<p>'Of course I am, darling.'</p>
<p>'Not quite. . . . Not quite.' He leaned his cheek against
hers. 'What I want to say is--dearest, are you listening?'</p>
<p>'Of course I'm listening.'</p>
<p>'Whatever happens, <i>whatever</i> happens, we'll see one
another through everything. We know, don't we, that no one,
nothing, ever and ever can mean to us what we mean to one
another?'</p>
<p>'Yes, we do.'</p>
<p>'That's why we're happy if we have to beg in the streets.'</p>
<p>'I shan't mind begging in the least if we're together.'</p>
<p>He drew back from her a little. He put his hand under her
chin.</p>
<p>'Even your old flame--who's very very clever, isn't he?--won't
take you from me?'</p>
<p>Meg laughed quite hysterically.</p>
<p>'Fred, what an absurd idea! Why, he's got white hair.'</p>
<p>'And you love me, love me, love me?'</p>
<p>'I adore you.'</p>
<p>Meg looked at him, smiling. Then she said slowly:</p>
<p>'If--for a day, a night, a minute, a second I <i>were</i>
unfaithful--how would it be?'</p>
<p>'It would be as we said at the beginning it was to be. We
agreed then that we should both be free--absolutely.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but you would love me less?'</p>
<p>'I don't know how it would feel.'</p>
<p>'People would think it disgusting if you didn't.'</p>
<p>'We've nothing to do with people,' Fred said, 'or anyone
else's rules.'</p>
<p>But Meg was thinking:</p>
<p>'Yes--but I've a kind of wildness in me--always have had, and
one day perhaps before I'm an old woman and everything's over I
might--just to be kind, to smell a whiff of adventure--I might be
<i>too</i> kind.'</p>
<p>'That would be up to you,' Fred answered. 'What I couldn't be
responsible for would be my own feelings. But we'd be honest with
one another and <i>I</i> think we'd go on loving one another
whatever happened.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' Meg said. 'But not in the same way. I think there's
nothing more horrible than for people to have <i>rights</i> over
one another. Horrible, horrible! We're free, as you say, you and
I! But, put laws and religion and tradition and what conventional
people think <i>all</i> aside, love between husband and wife
follows the same instincts as it did ten thousand years ago. Love
can be damaged.'</p>
<p>'Has ours,' he asked quickly, 'by my--well--weaknesses?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I think it has--a little. I love you just as much, but a
little differently and not quite so finely. Of course,' she went
on rapidly, 'we aren't very fine people--not as fine people go.
We're <i>happy</i> people, which is quite another thing. If we
were finer we wouldn't be quite so happy maybe. There's a little
bit of the guttersnipe in both of us, Fred. In Larry, too. In
Kitty a little. But <i>not</i> in Bullock, I think.'</p>
<p>She got up, looking at him.</p>
<p>'All the same our love for one another is grand. And it would
be silly--for some little quick sensation--to spoil it. People
do--often. But I'm not to be trusted--not for another while or
so. No other man but you has made love to me for years and it
<i>is</i> so agreeable!'</p>
<p>He looked at her and then beyond her. 'We're free. Our love's
based on that.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps we shouldn't <i>be</i> free. Maybe we're going to
find that out.'</p>
<p>But he was never any good at serious discussion.</p>
<p>'Wait a minute,' he said. 'I'll be back.'</p>
<p>He went into the dressing-room to clean his teeth.</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c105" id="c105">CHAPTER V</a></h1>
<h2>THE GROUND TREMBLES UNDER HIS FEET</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Shepherd Market about ten of the morning when the sun has not,
as yet, broken through the wispy fog-mist, is like a little
miniature town under water. Nothing is quite clear, yet nothing
is really indistinct. If you enter under Miss Bonda's archway,
with only a step or two, you drop the whole of London behind you,
or rather you enter into the very nutshell of London, having
within a few feet of you everything that London can provide.</p>
<p>In Carrington House you can see the backside of all London's
present splendour: you may, by ringing a bell and murmuring a
sentence or two, be the possessor of a regal apartment at a regal
price and call the Green Park your own. Indeed one of the
qualities of Shepherd Market is that it is not only a fortressed
town in itself, but from its windows you can look out on to the
whole campaign of the outer world. You are, in fact, here and
now, the <i>very centre</i> of the world and well does every
citizen of Shepherd Market know it. It is the last stronghold of
mediaevalism, the supreme remaining quintessence of Victorian
Dickens England as the very sign of 'Ye Grapes' reminds you; in
its glistening blood-brown leather of boot and shoe there is the
soul of the English Squirearchy; the shops offish and game smell
of rivers running turbulently to sea, and green meadows fading
before the evening star; the window of old books and prints
offers you culture. Beer and kippers and varnished leather and
fresh spring flowers, the evening newspaper, a cut off the joint
and two veg. for a shilling, Apartments for Gentlemen, strings of
glass beads, Chinese boxes, Elizabethan ivory in Philo's window,
the butcher's red harvest, two canaries in a cage for half a
crown, 'All the Winners' and sweet cakes and coffee at Café No.
I--you can live within these walls for ever, need never step
outside, and can have all your mental, bodily, spiritual wants
supplied till the coffin is ready for you.</p>
<p>In this rose-mist cold-snap morning light this little square
of ground has more of the spiritual sense of London than any
other spot on this cinder of a star. Be dropped here blindfold
and you'll smell in a second where you are. It is not only the
fish and the leather and the fresh spring flowers, it is rather
the way that London has of living with intense quiet, its finger
on its nose, plunged so deep into the past that you cannot, if
you are a foreigner, conceive that there is any present life at
all--a mistake that foreigners have been given to making through
all England's past history. If, dropped from an aeroplane, you
stood there blindfold, say in the very centre of Market Street,
you would hear people moving on every side of you and almost no
sound coming from them. A dog would brush against your leg, you
would scent the rough fur of the cat as it moved toward the
fish-and-game Paradise, somewhere from a far distance beyond the
walls there would be the humming whirr of traffic. You might
fancy that you caught the echo of Sam Weller's ghostly greeting
or the ponderous dogmatism of Samuel Johnson, Mrs. Gamp's husky
endearments, the shrill cry, like a call from the battlements, of
King James' apprentice, the ghostly song of Piers Plowman himself
finding this soil still stream-watered. Time marches on, and yet
there is no Time here.</p>
<p>And then, your bandage removed, you would stand there
blinking, for the thin fog has not cleared yet and it is as
though under water the figures are moving and it is under water
that the voices are hushed. Nevertheless wait a little and you
will find the life as practical and workaday as in any one of the
blessed Five Towns themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Brocket is very practical indeed. There is no
poetry-nonsense for him as he moves, hither and thither, engaged
on his morning shopping. Mr. Brocket, in a decent dark suit and a
bowler hat, moved very cheerfully among his fellow-men. Brocket
was in no kind of way a bad human being. The only trouble with
him was that he was, like many thousands of others, still a
child. He wished everyone well so long as his greed, his animal
desires, his sense of power were sufficiently fed. He had not
reached that stage of maturity that demands consideration of
others equal with goodwill to oneself. He was the type of whom
all tyrants, and men who work gladly for and under tyrants, are
made. But this was no sin in him. He had simply never developed
from the stage when he seized his little sister's liquorice-stick
because he was stronger than she, and twisted the arm of a boy
smaller and more nervous than himself. He thought himself a very
good man, as all tyrants think themselves good men. He had the
utmost contempt for those who are foolish enough to give anything
away without hope of practical return, who turn the other cheek
or who believe in the virtues of their friends. He trusted, as he
often said, 'in the strength of his good right arm,' although if
a right arm stronger than his own appeared he was most polite,
even sycophantic towards it.</p>
<p>He lied when there was no likelihood of being found out and
called it 'good business.' He was often drunk and called it
'making merry with his pals.' He seduced any woman whom he could
persuade or force, and called it 'a weak spot for the fairer
sex.' He considered, without thinking about it, that the whole
universe swung round himself. There had been moments--of illness,
of plain speaking from someone too strong for him to defy, of
money difficulties--when it had seemed to him as though this
might not be so. Then he had been very frightened indeed. Under
his jollity, good comradeship, and fun with those weaker than
himself, there ran a tremor of apprehension. If, for half an
hour, he knew indigestion he was certain that it was cancer. If
one of his little financial adjustments were in danger of
discovery he saw prison gates opening in front of him; if a girl
threatened trouble he considered, for a moment, the gas-oven. All
this was because he was still a child--a dirty-minded, ignorant,
bullying child. Not his fault. Only, in parenthesis, one may
remark that it is astonishing when you consider how long
civilization has been at work that there should still be so many
children about. Astonishing and a little disappointing
perhaps.</p>
<p>Brocket was well liked, on the whole, in Shepherd Market. He
was considered a big, jolly, friendly man. He had but few
intimates and they knew well that, at heart, he was neither jolly
nor friendly. Women liked him until they became intimate. After
that, they were often too unpleasantly frightened to talk.</p>
<p>He moved about the Market, buying a thing here, a thing there.
He knew the just price of everything. He knew also the characters
of his fellow-citizens. Some he threatened a little (for he was a
great repository of dirty and mean secrets), some he placated,
with a few he had a kind of secret understanding. There was a
young girl, a servant in one of the flats near by, whose person
he considered favourably. She was very young, rosy-faced, and, he
believed, ignorant of the world. He had, as yet, only passed with
her the time of day; he hoped soon to know her better. He watched
now, as he moved about, to see whether she too might not be
engaged on a bit of shopping. She was nowhere to be seen. Then he
remembered that he must have a word or two with his tenant, Mr.
Willoughby, and so he moved homeward.</p>
<p>Claude was in his room considering a far from agreeable post.
His post that morning consisted of one letter only and that was
from Mr. Clive Markham, his solicitor, who managed his
affairs.</p>
<p>Clive Markham also managed the affairs of the Pake ladies.
They had introduced Claude to him, and very kind Mr. Markham had
been, for he managed Claude's few investments with all the care
possible and never charged him a penny for the service. Being a
man of good heart he hated to have to write Claude this kind of
letter--a letter which informed him that the Toddington
Waterworks were unable to pay any dividend just now but hoped to
be a little more generous next time. That meant that the twenty
pounds upon which Claude had calculated would not be forthcoming.
He had paid, happily, his last quarter's rent, but on what would
he live during the present quarter?</p>
<p>He sat there, shivering, in his old dressing-gown, but the
blood of the Willoughbys which had often assisted him before came
to his rescue again. He was not defeated. He had no intention of
being defeated. He must sell something. So he went to the
cabinet, opened it and surveyed his treasures. There they
were--his silver christening mug, a Jacobean dagger of chased
silver, two gold snuffboxes, the miniature of his mother as a
child in a thin gold frame, a small, very ancient Toby jug in
black and brown, a gold brooch with pearls that had belonged to
his mother, and an exquisite little cup and saucer out of which,
his mother used to tell him, Marie Antoinette had once drunk her
morning coffee.</p>
<p>He looked at these, his thin little body shaking with cold,
his head shaking with sentiment. He <i>could</i> not sell these
things, not one of them! Something else must be done. He must
consult Millie and Helen who, very nearly in his own condition,
must have many brilliant ideas. He sat down again, picking up his
<i>Telegraph</i> to read about the dreadful hardships of the
South Wales miners, when the door quietly opened and Brocket, in
his shirt-sleeves and brown apron, presented himself.</p>
<p>'Mr. Willoughby, it isn't an agreeable thing to bring forward,
as I told Major Pierson, but the plain fact is that he's missing
a bottle of bath salts bought at Fortnum and Mason's only two
days back and he's wondering if you happen to have seen them when
you was down there 'aving your bath.'</p>
<p>Claude put by his paper.</p>
<p>'Is Major Pierson suggesting I stole them?' he asked.</p>
<p>The hairs on Brocket's head seemed, like the stars of God, to
sing together in glory. How greatly he enjoyed a little scene
like this! It was meat and drink and more to him. Having been
deprived of a little conversation that morning with the
rosy-cheeked servant, he must take his pleasure some other way.
It was true that Major Pierson had lost a bottle of bath salts or
<i>said</i> he had (silly old fool, what was <i>he</i> wanting
with bath salts!), but he had certainly never suggested that Mr.
Willoughby had taken them. That was all Brocket's bright
idea.</p>
<p>'Why no, Mr. Willoughby, in course not, most certainly not.
Major Pierson's a gentleman, and between gentlemen such things
aren't done, I <i>do</i> 'ope. He only suggested I might enquire
about the 'ouse, the bottle being missing and being just new,
practically unopened, one might say.'</p>
<p>'Please search my room, Brocket, if that gives you any
pleasure.'</p>
<p>Claude was trembling with rage at the insult, and he knew that
Brocket knew that he was trembling and was pleased thereat. He
was trembling with rage and also with a kind of nausea at
Brocket's close physical presence. This nausea had in it anger,
disgust, and also fear. Fear, lest on some sudden occasion,
Brocket should touch him. The thought of that touch haunted him.
It seemed to him fantastically as though, at one touch from
Brocket's horrible hand, he, Claude, would crumble into dust as
from the touch of death itself. These are tall words but they
were not at all exaggerated in Claude's consciousness. He was
old, not in very good health, had never sufficient food; under
such conditions the walls of the physical material world are
thinned, physical contacts are more imminent and more deeply
charged with significance. Brocket had never, in real life,
touched him, but Claude had known dreams in which Brocket's hairy
arms were around him and he was drawn closer and closer to the
thick breath, the evil panting heart, to the very horrors of
anticipated obscene death. . . .</p>
<p>Nevertheless he remarked very quietly: 'You know very well,
Brocket, that Major Pierson never even suggested that I took his
bath salts. I have not seen them in the bathroom. I'm afraid you
must look elsewhere.'</p>
<p>Brocket stepped further into the room, scratching one
pale-grey arm meditatively with a dirty fingernail.</p>
<p>'Now, Mr. Willoughby, that isn't very polite, if I may say.
That is as much as suggesting that I'm a liar. You're a
gentleman, Mr. Willoughby, and I'm sure don't wish to make such a
suggestion.'</p>
<p>'I don't say you're a liar, Brocket. I only repeat that I
haven't seen Major Pierson's bath salts. That's what you came
about, I think.'</p>
<p>Brocket looked at him. What a miserable, half-fed little weed
this was! Had the Soviet Union been in command in London and
Brocket a Commissar (a job he would have discharged with a
thorough and genuine enthusiasm), the fun that he might have had
with little Mr. Willoughby. As it was he continued broodingly to
scratch his arm, and suddenly Claude gave a jump in his chair and
cried: 'Don't do that! Stop scratching your arm!' There was a
silence. The two men stared at one another. Then Claude, his
heart beating as though it would strangle his words, said, 'I beg
your pardon. I don't know what led me . . . I beg your
pardon.'</p>
<p>Brocket coughed, rather as a delicately-minded lady might
after she had been affronted by some unexpected coarseness. Then,
his slippers flip-flapping under him, he left the room.</p>
<p>Claude dressed and thought that he would take a little air.
The sun was out by now, and in Market Street he recovered some of
his self-control. He was known to numbers of persons who
respected and liked him. 'A proper old gentleman.' 'One of the
old sort.' 'You don't see many of his sort nowadays.'</p>
<p>So he walked delicately, swinging his cane which he always
carried in fine weather, and thinking how greatly he would enjoy
breaking it over Brocket's rump had he but the opportunity and a
strong arm. In reality, he was trying to force himself into the
determination to give Brocket notice. He must find a room
somewhere else in a more modest quarter of London. He must not
any longer afford the grandeur of the Market.</p>
<p>But that removal seemed to him like a sentence of death. Once
in a dreadful little room in Bloomsbury or possibly even in
Camden Town (not that he had anything against either of those
admirable districts) he would be so utterly lost that he would
die. Lost. Forgotten. That's what he would be. So long as he was
citizen of the Market and might walk about, as he did on this
sunny morning, with his head up and his friends around him, he
lived, he had a reason for living. He was afraid of Brocket; he
hated, even detested him, but he would find a way to win a
victory there. Banished from the world that he had always known,
whose air he had always breathed, he would be strangled and die.
. . .</p>
<p>'Good morning, Mr. Willoughby. Nice day, isn't it?'</p>
<p>Claude turned, and there was young Bullock Delaney. They had
met, once, twice, for brief moments in the Pake sitting-room. And
what a nice young man young Delaney was! He had such charming
manners, listened to what you had to say, smiled so often, was so
anxious to be kind.</p>
<p>This, alas, was what all lame dogs thought of young Bullock,
and a dreadful curse in young Bullock's life it was. He was
dedicated, in the modern drama, to the rôle of 'Charles, His
Friend.'</p>
<p>He was invited to advise and arrange more domestic troubles
than he cared to count; not at all because he was especially
wise, but because his heart was kind and he was, above all, a
good listener. He differed from his sister Kitty in that he
possessed a wider sympathy than she. Like all women she preferred
to have all her eggs in one basket, and once the basket was
filled she concentrated on it entirely. But Bullock, having, in
spite of his literary intentions, not a great deal to do, being
happy himself and very trustful of others, believed the stories
that were told him and guilelessly tried to assist. He was
considered, therefore, a fool by nine-tenths of his
acquaintances, and a deep Machiavellian plotter by the other
tenth. He was neither a fool nor a saint, possessing good brains
in certain directions, and all the regular weaknesses. He was for
ever falling in love and had known one or two successes in spite
of his small stature. A little drink made him so heady and gay
that he looked and behaved foolishly. When he played cards he
played badly and lost more than he could afford. Almost any
scoundrel could take him in with a tall story. He believed in his
friends quite foolishly. He was exasperatingly stupid at times.
But his heart was warm and generous, his sense of honour
immaculate, his courage undefeatable.</p>
<p>At the first sight of Claude he had been touched just as his
sister was, but this morning, in the Market, he caught before
Claude veiled it a look of troubled embarrassment, of a
frightened anxiety, that moved him deeply. Brocket, looking out
of the first-floor window, thought them a comic little pair.
'They'd go well in a midget show,' he commented to Mrs.
Schneider, the cook, with whom he was having a kind of rogues'
interview.</p>
<p>'Can't all 'ave <i>your</i> 'ight, Mr. Brocket,' said Mrs.
Schneider, deeply brooding over the best way to cheat Brocket
without his discovering it.</p>
<p>'Yes, it <i>is</i> a nice day, isn't it?' said Claude
cheerfully.</p>
<p>'Out for a stroll?' asked Bullock, wondering what the old
boy's trouble was.</p>
<p>'Only a little constitutional. We don't get the sun such a lot
this time of year.'</p>
<p>'No, we don't, and that's a fact.'</p>
<p>'I live just here. Rooms in White Horse Street.'</p>
<p>'Oh, do you?' said Bullock. 'Most romantic spot in London I
always think this is.'</p>
<p>'It <i>is</i> romantic, isn't it? I do hope they won't pull it
down. They're always threatening to.'</p>
<p>'We'll have to fight for it if they do. You and I, Mr.
Willoughby--side by side.'</p>
<p>Then Bullock had an idea. He had been considering. He could
not bear to leave the man without some suggestion of
friendliness.</p>
<p>'Doing anything to-night, Mr. Willoughby?'</p>
<p>Claude tried to look as though he <i>could</i> be doing a
hundred different things and had the greatest difficulty in
choosing between them.</p>
<p>Bullock went on. 'I'm going round to a little party in a
friend's rooms this evening. Quite near here. Back of Berkeley
Square. Care to come?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I--well, I think I <i>could</i> arrange . . .'</p>
<p>'That's fine. A pal of mine is coming with me. Has rooms in
our house. A poet he is, named Munden. Ever heard of him?'</p>
<p>'No. I can't say I have. But then I don't--'</p>
<p>'Don't suppose anyone else has ever heard of him, either, only
<i>he</i> doesn't know it.' Bullock became very businesslike.
'Right. Meet you outside the Christian Science Church this
evening at eight-thirty. That suit you?'</p>
<p>'Oh, perfectly--perfectly.'</p>
<p>Claude took a great deal of trouble to be smart and handsome
for the occasion. He had been invited once more to a party, not
merely to tea with the Pakes or a drink in somebody's Club, but a
<i>real</i> party. Who knew what might come of it? He realized,
as he stroked the creases out of his blue-and-white tie and
examined the sleeves of his blue coat with anxiety to see whether
they were too shiny or no, that, in his secret heart, he had
been, during these last hard years, hungering for a little of his
old social life. He loved a party. He had enjoyed, once, so many
of them.</p>
<p>And now, through that kind young Delaney, he would enjoy
another. He saw the beautiful girls with their kind attention to
himself. He saw himself wagging his head with a roguish smile and
heard himself saying: 'Oh, but I'm an old buffer! You won't find
it any fun dancing with me!' and then, almost as though it were
in a play by Barrie, the lovely young creature murmured: 'Mother
has told me that in her younger day you were the life and soul of
the Town. I see you as that now. To me you are not old, etc.
etc.' Nor was he, for even as the lovely young creature spoke, at
the word 'Mother' he was transformed, etc. etc. Well, who knows?
This might be, after all, his Indian Summer.</p>
<p>He was a trifle disconcerted when he saw young Delaney's
friend. He scarcely, in his appearance, promised the kind of
party for which Claude had been spiritually arranging. A tall
gaunt hungry-looking young man in a pair of not overclean flannel
trousers and a waterproof. But then, Claude remembered, Delaney
had said that he was a poet, and young poets were seldom clean or
well-dressed--although why that had to be so, Claude could not
imagine.</p>
<p>As they walked along Claude wished that he had never left
home, because Mr. Munden pushed along, talking at the top of his
voice and striding so fast that Claude almost had to run to keep
pace with him. Mr. Munden used many oaths and strong words and
was, once or twice, most distinctly indecent. He inveighed
against the Nazis, which Claude was glad of because he didn't
like the Nazis himself, but, on the other hand, he seemed to be
blood-brother to Stalin, which Claude didn't at all approve of.
The main burden of his song, however, was that 'money should be
taken from those who had it and given to those who hadn't.' He
suddenly turned quite fiercely to Claude.</p>
<p>'You're nothing but a bloody plutocrat, I suppose?'</p>
<p>'I don't quite understand,' said Claude stiffly. His
Willoughby blood was always up when anyone spoke to him
rudely.</p>
<p>'Well, you're rolling in money, I fancy. Don't you think that
you should give some of it to the workers? Why should <i>you</i>
have it? What have <i>you</i> done to deserve comfort and
luxury?'</p>
<p>Then Claude laughed. He laughed very heartily indeed for an
old gentleman of seventy. He laughed and laughed and laughed.
Then he remembered his manners.</p>
<p>'I'm very sorry. I'm afraid you'll think I'm extremely rude,
but the fact is--the fact is--well, to tell you the truth, I've
got no money at all. I can't even afford a new suit.'</p>
<p>Bullock laughed too, as he always did at anything Munden had,
politically or economically, to say.</p>
<p>'That's one on you, old boy.'</p>
<p>Munden, who wouldn't hurt a fly if he could help it, was most
apologetic.</p>
<p>'Well, I say--no, but I didn't mean to intrude on your private
affairs--I thought from what Bullock said--I really am extremely
sorry.'</p>
<p>The laugh had done Claude a lot of good, although he thought
it a lapse of taste on his part to have spoken about money in
public.</p>
<p>'Quite. No harm done, I assure you. Only that anyone should
think me well off . . . ah, here we are!'</p>
<p>And there they were, outside a forbidding-looking building
with some shabby steps and a very worm-eaten door. Bullock pushed
a bell, the door opened, they climbed dark stairs. Another bell
was pushed and at once they were in a room, filled with
tobacco-smoke, faces, arms, legs. A voice was crying: 'Blood!
Blood! Who ever got anywhere without bloodshed? You people all
sit there so comfortably when, at your very side, men and women
are starving. And <i>aren't</i> the rich men clever! How do they
keep the poor man quiet? By giving him just enough to keep alive
on, but <i>not</i> enough to have strength to fight. Scarecrows!
Half-alive corpses! That's what we're breeding in England! If I
had my way I'd hang all the Baldwins, Edens, Duff Coopers,
Nuffields and the rest down Piccadilly! Piccadilly should swim in
the blood of the rich if that means the poor are going to have
fairer lives!'</p>
<p>'Bravo, Benny!' 'First class!' 'First blood to you, Benny!'
Applause, some of it derisive, echoed.</p>
<p>Claude was surprised to realize that the orator was a tall
handsome young man with a pullover and beautifully creased
flannel trousers. He had a charming voice and one of the mildest,
most amiable faces ever seen. He looked at his gold wrist-watch
as soon as he had finished speaking. 'Time for food!' he
cried.</p>
<p>Then he saw his new guests.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Patrick! Why, Bullock, you young bastard, I haven't
seen you for weeks.'</p>
<p>'Hullo, Benny. . . . <i>This</i> is a friend of mine, Claude
Willoughby.'</p>
<p>'How do you do, Mr. Willoughby? Come and have something to
eat.'</p>
<p>Easy said. There was a table at the end of the long, low room,
and everyone was pressing around it. There were a great many
people. It seemed to Claude, with his old-fashioned eyes, that
the women looked like boys and the men like women. Had he read
any lighter literature of the last ten years he would not have
dared to think anything so trite. It was clear enough, however,
that this was a very different party from any that he had ever
attended. No one was going to remember her mother here. There was
a terrible noise. Everyone talked at once.</p>
<p>'Benny's right. Sweep everything away. That's what we've got
to do,' a plump young man near Claude was saying.</p>
<p>A plain girl in enormous spectacles replied in a steady voice,
as though she were breaking stones in the road: 'Well, I don't
know. It's easy to talk like that, but a friend of mine's just
had three months in Russia and she says it's <i>most</i>
uncomfortable. You can't buy a thing and the streets are always
up. But the worst part of it is it's so damned dull.'</p>
<p>The plump young man was most indignant. 'Oh, God! I suppose
you'd rather have the bloody Nazis!'</p>
<p>'Not at all,' said the plain girl steadily. 'I don't see why
we need have either. I think England's pretty good myself.
Anyway, it's better than anywhere else except Scandinavia. What
do you want to make a change for?'</p>
<p>'I see,' said the plump young man, and his voice rose into a
shrill treble. 'It means nothing to you that in the Distressed
Areas families haven't enough to eat, children are skeletons.
Why, I heard the other day of a man in South Wales who had the
same suit for five years!'</p>
<p>'All the same,' said the plain girl, 'things are improving. I
lived in Durham as a small child. There were plenty of people
starving, but nobody bothered. Sixty years ago half of England
was starving and nobody cared.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said the plump young man, almost spitting in his scorn.
'And you won't mind if in another two years England is
Fascist.'</p>
<p>'Fascism,' said the plain young woman, 'is a joke in England
and always will be.'</p>
<p>Claude listened to all this with a great deal of interest and
considered how very different it was from the conversation at
pre-War parties in London.</p>
<p>However, the real truth of the matter was that he was
terrifically hungry. No one in the room knew it, but he had had
nothing at all to eat since breakfast, feeling that he had better
lose no time in starting new economies. Munden and Bullock had
discovered friends, so he must fight for himself. This he did
most gallantly. He was a little man and wormed his way first here
and then there, until at last he found himself before the
best-spread table he'd seen for months. There were sandwiches of
every kind--foie gras, salmon, tongue. There were little
sausages, and hot biscuits with cheese, and salads, enormous
cakes, and as fine a bowl of some extremely intoxicating liquor
as he'd ever tasted.</p>
<p>'They'd like this in South Wales,' he thought as he began to
gobble.</p>
<p>Bullock had, for a moment, forgotten his friend, because,
within five minutes of entering the room, he had fallen in love.
This had often happened to him before and as quickly, but this
time he had fallen in love with a child. Or was she a child?</p>
<p>He had seen her almost directly after entering the room. She
was sitting on a chair and holding a plate with a piece of cake
on it. She was, however, not eating the cake but looking gravely
in front of her. She was dark, slight, a child perhaps of
fourteen or fifteen years, but what touched at once Bullock's
tender heart was that she appeared to be quite alone in this gay
and noisy company. She was speaking to no one, and no one was
speaking to her. He touched a friend's arm.</p>
<p>'Look at that child. What on earth is <i>she</i> doing
here?'</p>
<p>His friend followed his gaze.</p>
<p>'Oh, that . . . that's Lizzie Coventry.'</p>
<p>'Lizzie Coventry?'</p>
<p>'Oh, she comes to parties quite often. She's not a child
really. In years, yes. She's going on sixteen, I believe. But she
knows a lot about life. You'd be surprised.'</p>
<p>'How very extraordinary!' Bullock stared and stared. 'But
<i>who</i> is she?'</p>
<p>'<i>Who</i> is she? The daughter of Captain Nicholas Coventry.
He's that good-looking, dissipated chap talking to Mona.'</p>
<p>'Well, who's <i>he,</i> then?'</p>
<p>'Coventry? Watch your step, my lad. He's dangerous.'</p>
<p>'Dangerous? Why?'</p>
<p>'He's charming--very charming--and most certainly will end in
gaol. He lives on his wits. At present, I believe, he's running a
little friendly gambling establishment off Coventry Street
somewhere.'</p>
<p>'My God! And that child lives with him?'</p>
<p>'Certainly she does--and has always done. But she can look
after herself, I fancy. She's a nice kid really and has the hell
of a life.'</p>
<p>'Will you introduce me, Bellamy?'</p>
<p>'Why, of course, old chap.'</p>
<p>They threaded their way across.</p>
<p>'Lizzie, this is a friend of mine--Bullock Delaney. He wants
to know you. Miss Coventry--Mr. Delaney.'</p>
<p>She looked at him gravely and held out her hand. There was a
chair vacant beside her and he sat down.</p>
<p>Bullock smiled and she smiled.</p>
<p>'Excuse my butting in like this. I've no excuse.'</p>
<p>Miss Coventry gave him her plate.</p>
<p>'Would you put that away somewhere, please? I'm not
hungry.'</p>
<p>He took the plate and quickly returned.</p>
<p>'Awful noise they're all making, aren't they?'</p>
<p>'Yes. There's always a noise at parties, isn't there?'</p>
<p>She was entirely at her ease, but not, he thought, in the
least interested. He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort
her--and yet she did not appear to be at all in need of
comfort.</p>
<p>'Do you go to parties often?'</p>
<p>'If my father takes me.'</p>
<p>'Do you like them?'</p>
<p>'Not very much. But I don't care--'</p>
<p>'Aren't you--? I mean--'</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>'You mean--I ought to be at school? Not at parties?'</p>
<p>'Oh no--that is, if you liked parties. But as you don't--'</p>
<p>'I've never been at school anywhere very long. You see, we're
always moving about.'</p>
<p>'You travel a lot?'</p>
<p>'We <i>have</i> travelled a lot, but we've been in England now
for nearly three years. First we stayed with my aunt, Mrs.
Carlisle, in Westminster, and since then we've been with friends
of my father's, and now we live alone together.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes.' He had never seen such dignity, such perfect poise
in anybody. What would she say, he wondered, if he were to say to
her: 'I only saw you a moment ago, but I'd like already to take
you away and look after you. I'm sure you're frightened often,
that you're unhappy . . .'</p>
<p>Instead he said, 'I suppose you've got heaps of friends in
England?'</p>
<p>'My father knows many people. But one doesn't make friends
often, does one?'</p>
<p>'I'm afraid I do. I'm very impulsive.'</p>
<p>She looked at him as though she were many years older than
he.</p>
<p>'I don't think that's wise--to be very impulsive, I mean. I
love my aunt and uncle and they have a nice boy, Edward. Although
I never see them,' she added, and then, against her will it
seemed, a small sigh escaped her and she did appear, in that
instant, a real child. He obeyed, torrentially, his impulse.</p>
<p>'Look here. Tell me where you live, will you? I'm perfectly
harmless. Everyone will tell you that. I'd like to see you
again.'</p>
<p>She gave him a grave look. She was considering him.</p>
<p>'What did Mr. Bellamy say your name was?'</p>
<p>'Delaney. They call me Bullock because I'm so short and, oh,
well, bullocky.' He laughed and she laughed too.</p>
<p>'Yes. If you like. Our address is thirty-five Borden Street,
off Coventry Street.'</p>
<p>'I'll telephone. Could I meet your father?'</p>
<p>'Of course.' She got up, went a few paces, pulled at her
father's arm and said something to him. Bullock got up.</p>
<p>'Father, this is Mr. Delaney. He'd like to meet you.'</p>
<p>Captain Coventry was extremely friendly. Bullock could see
that he had been very good-looking, but that now there was too
coarse a red, too stout a body, too thick a voice. Nevertheless
the Captain was charming, and, although he had undoubtedly been
drinking, could command all the courtesies and amenities of
social intercourse.</p>
<p>'Come and see us, old boy. Ring up. Name's in the book. Any
time.'</p>
<p>'Thank you,' said Bullock. 'I will.'</p>
<p>The Captain turned away.</p>
<p>'You'll forgive me,' Bullock said, 'for being so abrupt?
Forcing myself on you?'</p>
<p>She stood up. They were exactly of a height.</p>
<p>'It was very agreeable,' she said. 'I am glad to know you,'
and dismissed him as though she had been royalty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Claude there came a horrible ten minutes. A strange
business. He never afterwards could remember it quite clearly. In
truth, he had drunk a number of glasses of the delicious liquor
and, having had but little to eat that day, and having also a
certain weakness in the head under spirituous potencies, he found
that the floor rocked ever so slightly under him, that he was
very happy, ready to talk to anybody, and that people moved in
tantalizing rhythms. Then, quite suddenly, his happiness was gone
and his heart was filled with fear. For out of the confusion, the
bright light, the crush and murmur of sound, there came a cold,
dominating voice. He could see the speaker quite clearly--a
short, broad-shouldered man who was addressing the party. The
other voices died. This man spoke, it seemed, into a listening
waiting world. Here, Claude knew at once, was the real thing. The
man spoke politely, but it was obvious that he was scornful of
everyone present. He spoke with a certainty and a freezing
assurance that chilled Claude's blood. He spoke of the new world
that was most positively coming. It was a world that would, it
was clear, have no use at all for anyone present in that room, a
world in which the rulers would be relentless, unsparing. A world
without tenderness or sentiment. A world without God, because God
was a fable and belief in Him an ancient exploded superstition. A
world in which everyone would work for the State, in which there
would be neither individuality nor personal property. A world in
which no human being would own anything, certainly not their own
souls. Not entirely an ugly world--there were strong, shining,
selfless qualities around and through it like rods of shining
steel. . . .</p>
<p>But, for Claude, a world from which his life would be snuffed
out as you snuff out a candle. It seemed to him as though this
little man were speaking especially to him, as though the
contempt in the man's eyes were directed solely against him.
Claude felt himself die. The rocking floor caught him, swallowed
him, buried him. The awful final thing was that in the man's
voice there was a negation of all personal life. As Claude
listened he ceased to be Claude.</p>
<p>The man stopped.</p>
<p>'Thanks for letting me say a word or two,' he ended.</p>
<p>'Let's dance!' someone cried. 'Come on, let's dance.'</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c106" id="c106">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>
<h2>FAMILY FOSTER</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Kitty, as she saw her mother bend over the crying child, lift
her up, brush her shabby little frock, give her a piece of money
out of her bag, thought that there could be no one, surely, in
the world, more charming. Her charm lay, at the moment, in her
complete unselfconsciousness, for although they were in Curzon
Street on this gusty, gritty, unpleasant afternoon, with everyone
in the world to observe them, although Meg was in her best
clothes (for she was going ultimately with Larry to a grand
cocktail party), she had knelt down on the pavement and been as
completely absorbed in the dirty infant as though she were her
own offspring. The child, running out of Shepherd Market, had
slipped and fallen. She howled but was not damaged. Then she had
stood staring at this tall lady in dark purple and a large hat;
after that, with the piece of money in her hand, joyfully she had
run on.</p>
<p>Meg started forward with her daughter again, continuing her
conversation just where she had left off.</p>
<p>'. . . and so I think, darling, that Bullock's in love once
again. He's such a sweet boy, but knows nothing about women, I'm
afraid--nothing at all. But then, I say to myself, who does?
Certainly not writers. Not politicians either, or they'd
<i>never</i> let women have anything to do with politics. Fred
doesn't either, and <i>I</i> don't and Larry doesn't. The point
about women is, can you ever be sure that they won't do something
on the spur of the moment?'</p>
<p>'Can you be sure that men won't either?' asked Kitty.</p>
<p>'Yes, I think you can, dear, because they're so much more
selfish. Once they're after something they want, <i>nothing</i>
will change them or turn them. Although when they <i>have</i> got
it they usually don't want it.'</p>
<p>But Kitty was thinking. She seldom read novels, but by her bed
there had been a book, by a very clever young man, called <i>Mud
in Your Eye,</i> and, being awake from three to seven (most
unusual for her), she had read it. Very clever the young man was,
springing from character to character like an acrobat, but very
unpleasant too. Kitty didn't complain of that, because facts were
facts, but she was thinking now how very out-of-place her mother
and father would seem in such a book. And yet they were surely
quite as real as the charwoman with the erysipelas (minutely
described) or the shop-girl who went to bed with so many
different gentlemen. The end of the book had been occupied with a
brilliant description of a man spitting blood into a basin while
his old mother, whose head was scrofulous, alternately smacked
and petted him. Now if, instead of this, there had been a
description of Meg, picking up a child and giving it sixpence,
Meg a lady, happy, contented and handsome, <i>how</i> unreal the
book would appear! How scornful the brilliant young man was of
happiness! No one was happy in his book, not a single soul. No
one was physically clean. But wasn't, even in these days, one
part of life as true as the other? There <i>were</i> people who
used soap and water, there <i>were</i> families happy and
devoted, there <i>was</i> beauty to be found . . . Kitty pulled
herself up. She was becoming platitudinous and complacent.</p>
<p>'But why do you think Bullock is in love, Mother?'</p>
<p>They were passing the bookshop whose window was always filled
with coloured illustrations of flowers and old maps with whales
spouting water in the corners. Seen at a distance this window
looked like a page from an old missal (neither Meg nor Kitty had
this thought: old missals meant, I'm afraid, very little in their
lives).</p>
<p>But the bookshop suggested something to Meg.</p>
<p>'What charming pictures of flowers! I often go this way
instead of Piccadilly simply to see them. I think dear Bullock is
so like those nasturtiums--aren't they beautiful? Look at the
colour!--and now he's in love again all his tendrils are
twisting. Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking! Just like that man
who writes those charming books about his country cottage. But
Bullock is very strange. He's asked whether I mind his bringing
to tea one day a little girl and her scoundrelly father.'</p>
<p>'A little girl and her scoundrelly father?'</p>
<p>'Yes--and when I said of course, but why did he want to, he
said because he was in love with the little girl, and when I said
that that was nasty and unnatural he became quite excited and
cried out that he wouldn't harm a hair of her head, but that she
needed protecting. . . . And now I come to think of it, Kitty,
you've been odd yourself the last week or two. I wish you'd tell
me where you are going now this afternoon. At least no, I don't.
A mother must never force a daughter's confidences. And yet all
the same I <i>do</i> want to know. Do tell me, Kitty.'</p>
<p>And then Meg performed one of her more tiresome tricks. She
stopped in the street where she was--just outside Cook's offices.
This she sometimes did when she was very serious about something.
She was altogether regardless of people, and there is nothing in
life more irritating to sensible and busy men than to find two
women planted in the middle of the pavement talking to one
another. Meg looked with her large and lovely eyes at her
daughter.</p>
<p>'On my side, Mother,' Kitty said, laughing, 'I want to know
why within the last fortnight you have been twice to
Surbiton.'</p>
<p>'Oh,' said Meg grandly, 'there's no secret about that--no
secret at all. They are old friends of mine--at least <i>he</i>
is.'</p>
<p>'Yes, he is,' said Kitty. 'But Surbiton--it's unlike you to go
to Surbiton. And twice in a fortnight.'</p>
<p>At this point an impatient gentleman, planning undoubtedly to
go on a World Cruise straight from Cook's door, gave Meg's arm a
very impolite knock. She was not at all disturbed but smiled at
his angry face, wondering whether she'd met him perhaps at some
friend's house.</p>
<p>'We're blocking the pavement, Mother.'</p>
<p>'Oh, are we? Well, if you won't tell me, darling, I won't ask
you--only will you be in to dinner?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I will--and Bullock and I will take you to a picture
after.'</p>
<p>Meg was looking at her daughter as though for the first time.
She could not bear to let her go. She always felt about the
people she loved when she parted from them as though they were
just off to the South of France, and all she would get now would
be letters and possibly a telegram.</p>
<p>Kitty hailed a taxi, gave an address and was off. Meg walked
into Piccadilly, smiling, although Fred had often told her not to
smile in the street when she was alone lest people should think
her insane. But she could not help it. She was really so very
fortunate to have so beautiful and charming a daughter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'This is undoubtedly the house,' thought Kitty. 'Ah, yes.
Here's his father's name--Albert Foster--on this dirty card above
the little bell.'</p>
<p>She paused before pushing the bell, looking up and down the
sordid paper-blown street. It was indeed a very bold and probably
foolish thing that she had done. She had simply written to the
young man and said that she had something to tell him about a
job, and she would, if he thought it sensible, speak to his
father and himself concerning it. The awful thing was that what
she had to tell him about a job was that Lady Millie Temple, who
had the big place Rathesay in Rutlandshire, wanted an
under-gardener. The young man had said that he loved flowers and
liked to live in the country--but did he know anything about
gardening? Almost certainly not. Moreover he seemed altogether
superior to the post of under-gardener, except that in these days
anyone took anything that he could get. Why was she doing this
insane and foolish thing? Even for a Delaney it was insane and
foolish. She had put on her very quietest frock, but the sight of
this dirty street made her visit officious, interfering and
snobbish. But she could not help it. Her impulses always seemed
to her like laws. She was not sentimental as Bullock was, that
is, if sentimentality means spreading your feelings loosely and
lightly over a great many things and people. She had never done
anything like this in her life before. She was amazed, even
horrified, at herself, but she never dreamed of turning back.</p>
<p>Alton Foster, in his answer to her letter, had said that she
was very kind, that he would have an afternoon off on
such-and-such a day and that his father would be proud. Well, she
was in for it and would carry it out as handsomely as she
could.</p>
<p>The door opened and she climbed some forlorn stairs. There, in
a narrow grimy passage, was Alton Foster waiting for her. He was
exceedingly nervous. His hand was trembling.</p>
<p>'There are a great many stairs,' he said.</p>
<p>His nervousness moved her kindliness and made her perfectly at
home.</p>
<p>'Will you come in, please?'</p>
<p>She entered and found it one of the most surprising rooms in
her experience; for unexpectedness it ranked with the bedroom of
Rose Colthorpe's which was filled with little tanks containing
coloured fish, and Joe Cardinal's bathroom which was all glass,
black tiles and scented soap. For it was a broad room in shape
like the large waiting-room of a railway station. It had a little
that air of ancient disrupted newspapers and a heavy grumbling
fire that refused to burn. Nevertheless, in spite of a sense of
almost religious discomfort, the walls were painted with pictures
in the most lovely colours. Well painted too. Some of the paint
had flaked away, much of it was faded, but one could see clearly
enough a kind of Hoffmann world with witches, ghosts peering in
at windows, lovely battlements, forest glades and long stretches
of blue sea. Beautiful sensitive feeling this artist had had, the
colours, soft rose, gold and amber, peacock purple, the
silver-grey of the bark of a birch-tree, the dead white of a
vellum page--all these colours, faint, still, toneless. . . .</p>
<p>But upon these painted walls were hung pictures in cheap gilt
frames, and pictures of a frantic and almost obscene crudity.
They were in rude oils--valleys with autumn leaves, seas with
sunsets, streets with timbered buildings. The drawing was crude,
the colour dreadfully bright.</p>
<p>The room itself was kitchen, bedroom, sitting-room. There was
a cooking-stove; in the corner by the window a bed partly behind
a screen; there was a table spread with a cloth on which was laid
one of those teas provided by the hospitably eager for the
unhungry reluctant--cakes and cakes, scones and scones, dishes of
jam and dishes of jam, and all of it looking, through no fault of
its own, as though it had been exactly thus on this table for a
month or two.</p>
<p>On a sofa near the fire was lying a man with an almost
cherubic face and snow-white hair--quite cherubic it would have
been had the nostrils not been unexpectedly pinched as though
they had been held tight with a pair of nippers while someone had
carefully spread out the rest of the face. Under the rugs there
lay what was clearly a big and possibly corpulent body.</p>
<p>Standing with a nervous uncertain smile on her face was a
stout woman whose hair was waved so smartly that the rest of her
looked oddly old-fashioned. She was, of course, the daughter of
Mr. Foster, the sister of Alton. It was with her that Kitty first
shook hands.</p>
<p>'I'm afraid you'll think this a most impertinent visit on my
part.'</p>
<p>'Why, no . . . <i>such</i> a thing. . . . Tee-hee-hee. . . .
This is my father--Alton told you, I'm sure. . . .'</p>
<p>Whether Alton's sister had an impediment of speech, or
ill-fitting teeth, or was merely nervous, Kitty did not know and
never would know. Lucy Foster was a repository of sounds that
were always a little different from your expectations. When, for
instance, you were sure that she was about to sneeze, she
surprisingly laughed, and when you were preparing sympathy for a
choking cough, she merely yawned--very politely with her hand in
front of her mouth. She seemed herself often astonished at the
sounds her body arranged for her. Otherwise she laughed, giggled,
tee-heed extensively. She was also in a perpetual state of
surprise. All this Kitty discovered in the first ten minutes
while she fought a determined battle against eating more than a
piece of bread and butter.</p>
<p>She never, she explained, ate anything at tea. She was going
on to say something about slimming necessities when she realized
just in time that this might seem an affront to Lucy, whose
figure was ample.</p>
<p>'Well, I never! Do you hear that, Dad? . . . Miss Delaney
never eats with her tea. Fancy that now! What! Not a piece of
this plum-cake? It's ever so good. Do try now, Miss Delaney. Miss
Delaney should, shouldn't she, Dad? She should really. And so you
don't eat with your tea, Miss Delaney?'</p>
<p>Mr. Foster was Kitty's chief preoccupation. <i>What</i> a
noble head, what a cheery smiling face, what rosy cheeks, what
beautiful shining white hair! How smart, how spotless he was, and
there was even a small Christmas-rose in his buttonhole. He must,
once on a time, have been a magnificent man. His neck and
shoulders were superb. His bright blue eye had so courageous and
friendly a gleam!</p>
<p>'Well, Miss Delaney, I call it kind indeed for you to have
taken all this trouble to visit a poor helpless creature like
myself--not that I'm so helpless as you'd think with my good Lucy
here and Alton working for us as he does. Ah! Miss Delaney, how
much one has to be thankful for! To have such good children, to
be near the window here and see the clouds go by and think one's
own thoughts, simple as they are, but all moving God-ward, Miss
Delaney. <i>He</i> understands, He understands. And the hours
pass swiftly. There is the painting and the reading and the cup
of tea now and again. When one thinks of the many poor homeless
souls in the world, how fortunate, how very fortunate one
is!'</p>
<p>He was making a most magnificent tea, Kitty was pleased to
see. Except for his paralysis he was evidently in excellent
health, and even his paralysis could not be as bad as Alton had
described it, for he moved his arms quite freely.</p>
<p>Kitty, sitting opposite to him, very straight-backed in her
chair, nibbling her piece of bread and butter, wondered at his
serenity, his happiness, and yet was not completely reassured by
it.</p>
<p>For this room was not really a happy room. She knew what a
happy room was, having lived in one all her life long. This place
was as clean as though it had been sterilized. On the walls these
lovely soft colours, this romantic world, with a long-ago
touching cadence, a Conder-Pater world of dim but exquisite
beauty, was severed, interrupted again and again by the monstrous
glaring oils. And below these walls it was a bare and empty
world, in spite of the potted hyacinth on the window-sill, the
glowing fire, the heated stove, the fine recumbent figure, the
loaded tea-table.</p>
<p>'Ah, yes,' said Lucy Foster. 'You are looking at our walls,
Miss Delaney. Everyone does, don't they, Dad? Oh yes, indeed. . .
. The walls were painted by two young men years and years
ago--weren't they, Dad? Oh yes, Miss Delaney, they were. Isn't it
astonishing? That's why Dad took the rooms; isn't it, Dad?
There's a little one as well--my bedroom, Miss Delaney. Oh yes,
and a bathroom. They painted them all, didn't they, Dad? And Dad
thought they weren't half bad, so he took the rooms. Most
astonishing they are, and of course they're fading, and most of
our friends think they're silly, don't they, Dad, and of course
Dad's paintings are much finer--brighter and all that. People
have said he should show in the Academy, haven't they, Dad? Try a
bit of this cake, Dad. It's got cherries in.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, my dear, I think I will. You mustn't listen to my
daughter about my painting, Miss Delaney. She's partial of
course. And I'm self-taught. God's hand guided me. That's what I
always say. God, seeing my helplessness, revealed to me a
fragment of His great beauty. Thank you, my dear--I don't mind if
I do have another cup.'</p>
<p>Through all of this Alton had been busy looking after
everyone. He had not said a word and Kitty at once suspected
that, in the company of his father and sister, he was very quiet
and that they dominated him. He seemed very slight and even
foreign beside their hearty vitality. He was like a bright-eyed
bird hopping from twig to twig, some alarm behind the flash of
the eyes, on the watch, on guard--against what?</p>
<p>But again, after a certain time, Kitty was conscious that Mr.
Foster and his daughter were vibrating with wonder and excitement
at her visit. <i>What</i> was she doing there? <i>Why</i> had she
come? Without any snobbery on her own part she was aware that she
must seem to them a creature from altogether another world, and
she knew that Lucy was taking in every detail of her little hat,
her hair, her simple frock, her shoes. This led her to a further
discovery, namely that Alton had been quite other from these two
in this, that he had, from the first, had no sense of social
differences, that he was of her world, of anybody's world, that
his mind and imagination were busied with scenes, figures,
surmises very different from those of his father and sister.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster indeed could contain his curiosity no longer.</p>
<p>'My boy tells me, Miss Delaney, that you have most kindly
interested yourself in his welfare. He is a good boy and his
father is proud of him. My misfortune, Miss Delaney, has hampered
me so sadly, and the pension I received after my accident is so
meagre, that his sister and myself are dependent largely upon
Alton's earnings. He works hard and I am proud of him.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was a tinge, Kitty thought, of patronage in
his mellow agreeable tones, and she was reminded for an instant
of a character in one of her favourite novels, one of the few
that she had read many times, Mr. Turveydrop in <i>Bleak
House.</i> She dismissed the comparison as swiftly as it came
because Mr. Foster was clearly a person of generous and
courageous goodness. Nevertheless he was <i>not</i> paralysed. Of
that she was certain. Could Alton really believe that he was?</p>
<p>'You see, Mr. Foster' (and, as she began her explanation, the
soft rather floating eyes of Lucy Foster seemed to swim towards
hers with an almost indecent curiosity), 'I went into Zanti's to
enquire about something I saw in the window and there was your
son! We began to talk and I found that he loved the open air and
gardens. It was a strange coincidence that two days later I heard
that a friend of mine, Lady Millicent Temple, wanted an
under-gardener at her place in Rutlandshire.' Kitty smiled. 'It
would be an insult in ordinary times to suggest such a thing to
your son--but these aren't ordinary times, are they? A cousin of
mine as a matter of fact is working as a sort of under-gardener
at a place in Devonshire.' (Isn't this, she suddenly thought, a
very snobbish thing to say?) 'And so, as it wouldn't be very good
policy to talk about this in the shop, and as writing about such
things is always so unsatisfactory, I thought I would come myself
and see you.'</p>
<p>She realized at once that this innocent proposal horrified
both Mr. Foster and Lucy. Why? She looked at Alton. For the first
time on that afternoon their eyes met. With that exchanged glance
they were friends as they had not been before--quietly, but with
a new and hopeful assurance.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster took another and fat piece of cherry-cake, cleared
his throat, and with one of the cheeriest and brightest smiles
Kitty had ever seen, addressed her.</p>
<p>'If that isn't good of you, Miss Delaney! I think that's one
of the kindest things I've ever known. And I know Alton feels the
same. He must answer you for himself, of course, but I am afraid,
I'm seriously afraid, that his experience of gardening is
scarcely sufficient.' He looked quite unconsciously at a large
cherry embedded in his cake. 'What do you say, my son?'</p>
<p>Alton answered very quietly.</p>
<p>'It's extremely good of you, Miss Delaney, but I'm afraid
Father's right. It's true that I do love the open air, but I
don't know enough to take a gardener's job. I'm afraid I misled
you by talking about flowers as I did.'</p>
<p>'I'm afraid you did,' said Mr. Foster, licking one of his
strong brown fingers and speaking quite sharply. 'The truth is,
Miss Delaney, that Alton here is really a town boy. He's seen
very little of the country and so fancies it a Paradise. But in
reality. . . . Well, well, God places us where we can be most
useful, I don't doubt, and Alton <i>is</i> most useful in town, I
am certain.'</p>
<p>They don't want him to leave London at any cost, Kitty
thought. He's too valuable to them. He's their prisoner.</p>
<p>'No, I see,' Kitty said. 'The idea won't do. But I thought I
ought to tell you.'</p>
<p>'That really <i>is</i> kind of you,' Lucy broke in. 'It's
astonishing really--that you should take all that trouble, I
mean.'</p>
<p>'Oh, but I've taken no trouble at all,' Kitty said. Mr. Foster
raised his hand almost as though in blessing.</p>
<p>'If everyone showed the spirit of kindness there wouldn't be
the trouble in the world there is to-day, nor all those starving
who oughtn't to be. When I think, Miss Delaney, of all those poor
fellows with not a rag to cover their back and no one doing a
thing to help them my blood boils. It does indeed. But your
goodness . . .'</p>
<p>There were all too many compliments flying about, Kitty
thought, and she rose to go.</p>
<p>Her small hand was held for too long a time in the strong firm
one of Mr. Foster, and she fancied that his eye was bold, gay and
enterprising.</p>
<p>She said good-bye to Lucy who, she was sure, disliked her
extremely.</p>
<p>Alton went with her down to the street. Standing there they
regarded one another once again as friends. She knew now that, as
far as herself was concerned, she liked him, trusted him and
quite certainly would see him again. On his side he was timid,
chivalrous, and clearly listening for some sound.</p>
<p>'When Father needs me, Lucy comes to the door and calls.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I see.'</p>
<p>'He's very helpless and is a big heavy man for Lucy to turn
over and so on.'</p>
<p>'I'm pleased, though,' said Kitty, 'to find that he isn't as
bad as I had expected. He isn't altogether paralysed, is he?'</p>
<p>'No, not exactly. Not physically, I mean. His spine <i>was</i>
damaged, but I'm glad to say he can do a number of things for
himself. Only it isn't good for him--to do too much, I mean.'</p>
<p>Then urgently, as though his whole life depended upon it:</p>
<p>'You'll let me see you again one day?'</p>
<p>'But of course,' Kitty said. 'We've made friends, haven't we?
Friendship isn't broken as soon as it's made.'</p>
<p>'Friends--you and I?'</p>
<p>'Why not? I don't make a new friend so often. Can I telephone
to the shop?'</p>
<p>'Yes, of course.'</p>
<p>'We might go for a walk in the Park or somewhere.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes . . . this is wonderful, miraculous for me. I've been
so lonely. If I may just talk to you sometimes. . . . I've had no
one to whom I can talk. I have ideas. I'm greatly interested in
the theatre. I'm trying to write a play, only I have so little
time. If I could speak to you sometimes about my ideas. . . . I
know they are all weak and immature. I'm so inexperienced. I've
seen so little of life. . . .'</p>
<p>'I'll tell you frankly,' said Kitty, laughing, 'that I'm
anything but clever. I'm a perfect fool in fact. But if you'll
take me as I am--'</p>
<p>'Take you as you are!'</p>
<p>Through the open door came the shrill cry of Lucy.</p>
<p>'Alton! Alton! Father wants you!'</p>
<p>He turned, caught her hand, pressed it.</p>
<p>'I must go. Good-bye! Good-bye!'</p>
<p>The door closed and, smiling to herself as her mother
sometimes did, Kitty walked on.</p>
<p>She climbed on to a bus and, during a stoppage in Shaftesbury
Avenue, she saw her father coming out of a shop, and with him was
Miss Van Renn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inside the house, within their own room, they forgot
altogether these disturbances from outside that were beginning to
colour their imaginations. For now their imaginations were only
for themselves. There was a kind of mysticism in their
relationship when they were alone and unselfconsciously loving
one another. Perhaps there is always more than one world created
by love, which is why immortality depends on love rather than
faith.</p>
<p>'Oh, hell!' Bullock cried, looking in at them from the door.
'Someone's been in my room. Everything's messed up on the
table.'</p>
<p>'I did,' said Kitty. 'I wondered if you'd have a
safety-pin.'</p>
<p>'Oh, damn you, Kitty! <i>Can't</i> you leave me alone? It's
all I've got. . . .'</p>
<p>And: '<i>If</i> you call this coffee, darling . . .' from
Fred.</p>
<p>But their security was terrific. They would love one another
perhaps more here in the heart of London than anywhere else, for
their love had elements in it of all that London indifferently
was creating--smoke like bats' wings, like torn paper, like the
flutter of a scarf, but seen through the smoke an animal of
sluggish, self-satisfied immortality. The consciousness of that
never-dying, tower-topped, mud-based, smoke-veiled, conceited
energy gives strength to lovers because, although the moment in
which they are then believing may fail them, there is something
here so real and so strong that their moment has in it the fibre
of stone and the skeleton of iron. Fred Delaney felt that. He
smelt the whiff of coal-smoke in the air, saw the sun-filled
cloud spill its colours on Piccadilly, heard Big Ben strike
across the Park, and knew that the four of them, himself, Meg,
Kitty and Bullock, were enclosed, protected, as though in a magic
circle.</p>
<p>'Come on! Come on!' Bullock cried. 'The last programme begins
at nine-five.' Then he went over and kissed his mother. They all
knew that their strength, their unity radiated from Meg.</p>
<p>'It's one of those Viennese pictures,' she said delightedly.
'I <i>do</i> like them. All waltzes and uniforms and great
four-posters.'</p>
<p>They sallied forth, Meg with Bullock, Kitty with her
father.</p>
<p>'And where have <i>you</i> been all the afternoon?' she asked
him.</p>
<p>'In the Club, darling; played bridge and lost three
shillings!'</p>
<p>'In the Club <i>all</i> the afternoon?'</p>
<p>'<i>All</i> the afternoon, darling.'</p>

<h2>PORTRAIT OF A LADY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Lady Millie Pake is, without question, an impossible figure in
any story of modern life. Did you begin anywhere, at any time in
these foreboding 'Thirties, a story introducing a perfect old
gentlewoman, you would soon be pausing, then clearing your
throat, then at last apologizing, for your audience would be
restless, their eyes cynical and sarcastic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Lady Millie did and does exist, and she was, and
is, a lady against whom no fault can be found, in whom there is
no blemish. How impossible it would be for any novelist then to
make her interesting were he to attempt the task! He would be
forced back into her past. She had had once the devil of a
temper, had been vain perhaps, and certainly proud of her family.
But time and the long years had washed all these impurities out
of her and she was now clean and shining like a fine
sea-shell--although that is a poor simile indeed, because she had
a great deal of life in her, quite a grim humour at times, and a
real intolerance of fools. She was anything but the 'sweet old
lady' you might have supposed from this preliminary. She hadn't
an atom of sentimentality in her and bore down heavily on weak
idealists. Nor, astonishingly enough, did she deprecate these
modern times. She saw that the world was in disorder, but she
could not remember a time when it was otherwise. In her old age
she had been gifted with a sense of Time. The immediate moment
had, it appeared to her, been always a moment of alarms, and she
was aware that present inventions had provided every morning's
breakfast-table with a full knowledge of every single event that
the world had created yesterday. She was not an optimist in the
sense of things being right because God was in His Heaven. She
was sure that God <i>was</i> there, and she thought that if she
were on God's level she would be able to argue with Him on a
number of things. But she was not. She had not been on her dear
father's level when, at the age of seven, she had questioned him
as to why the gardener had drowned a batch of kittens.</p>
<p>But, taking Time as a very large order, she did feel that
things in general improved. She remembered when, as a little
girl, she had paid visits to her Aunt Horsborough, in the great
rambling house Templeton, where two of the maids had slept under
the back-stairs in what was little more than a cupboard. She
remembered her visits with her aunt to Templeton village and the
beautiful thatched cottages down whose walls the wet dripped, and
the icy cold of the kitchen at the Vicarage had made her shiver.
She remembered the sycophantic greetings of the postman's wife,
crippled with rheumatism, and the beneficent magnificence of Aunt
Horsborough.</p>
<p>Instead of railing at young Communists like Patrick Munden,
she thought their anxiety for the poor, the helpless, and the
downtrodden very fine indeed.</p>
<p>For herself the constant anxiety about money meant very
little. She would be happy anywhere and she thought that she
could manage very nicely on almost nothing. It was only for her
sister that she was anxious. She disliked nobody except the
Corleone woman. She considered that she and the set around her
were hard, selfish and empty-headed. But she suspected that if
she knew the Corleone intimately she would find many things to
like in her. She felt that all the hatred that there was in the
world came from lack of intimacy. You would not, of course, like
<i>everybody</i> even though you knew them well, but you would in
all probability understand why they behaved as they did.</p>
<p>At the same time she had a keen eye for foibles, including her
own. She knew, for instance, that her hatred of 'litter' was
almost a disease, that she was given to speaking her mind too
frankly, that she was absurdly irritated by her friends'
unpunctuality, and that she disliked young women who made up
their faces during meals, told coarse stories, and bullied their
husbands in public. On the whole she liked men better than women.
She was modern enough to feel that the inequalities between rich
and poor in England were out of character with the new world. A
Scandinavian had once inveighed for a long time and with feverish
enthusiasm against what she had called the 'Manor House' life and
the London slums. She had paused at last for want of breath, and
had then been greatly astonished when Millie Pake admitted all of
it. 'But it is,' said Millie, 'changing. You should have seen
England forty years ago. We're very slow always, but we're kind
people really although we've very little imagination.' She envied
working-women she knew, they hadn't to keep up appearances. They
had a husband and children. She would like to have had
children.</p>
<p>But Millie Pake's outstanding quality was her cheerfulness.
Now cheerfulness is quite widely condemned in these times. If a
man is cheerful he is either stupid and therefore intolerable, or
his cheerfulness is a pose, or he is cheerful on principle.
Fortunately Millie was so old that she could excuse herself by
saying that she was pre-War, became cheerful when she was young
and had never been able to get out of the habit. She was not,
however, so self-conscious as that. She didn't realize that she
was cheerful, and if she irritated anybody by it she never knew
it. The truth was that nothing could dismay or frighten her very
badly because she was quite certain that when her body died her
soul would go to Heaven. This, of course, was, in the light of
modern science, so ridiculous that one can only call her a
foolish old woman. But, foolish or no, this belief gave her such
indifference to danger, and, because she hadn't to worry about
herself, enabled her to think so much about other people, that it
was undoubtedly a help--an unfair help, many people would
say.</p>
<p>It is true that she liked to have cheerful persons about her;
that was why she enjoyed the Delaneys so much. They were really
cheerful and laughed at quite ridiculous little things just as
she did. She did hope, for that reason among others, that they
would not be forced to leave the Charles Street house.</p>
<p>She was cheerful partly because she enjoyed on the whole very
good health. She really did enjoy it. As far as her body went,
she had, when she was very young, wanted to be beautiful. Now she
only wanted to be well. She was aware, naturally, of the strange
little aches and pains that accompany anybody who is over
seventy, but she was, as a rule, too busy to consider them. She
had no fear whatever of death, but she <i>was</i> afraid, when
she thought about it, of a long physical illness which would have
prevented her caring for her sister. She was, however, certain
that if that trial were allotted to her the Lord would help her
to manage. She never spoke to anyone about her religion, but in
fact her companionship with the Lord was not like a religion at
all. It was like a companionship.</p>
<p>She got a great pleasure out of the tiniest things: the taste
of buttered toast at tea, the sound of Big Ben across the Park,
the pictures in the <i>Daily Sketch</i> and the leaders in the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> (always so sound and honest: the Delaneys
sent these papers every day up to the Pake ladies when they
themselves had read them), a new novel lent them by some kind
friend, every sort of shop, the 'look' of the sitting-room when
the sun shone in through the window, the 'feel' of her grey silk
dress when she prepared for some little festivity, the singing of
the hymns in St. James's, Piccadilly, demon patience when it came
out (she would clap her hands and cry aloud, saluting its
rarity), the flower-stands outside the Christian Science Church,
a drive in a motor-car (kind friends sometimes offered her one),
almost anybody's dog (she had always longed for a dog, but Helen
didn't like dogs), a visit to one of her old friends and a chat
about old times, and, best of all (but this was <i>very</i> rare
because she couldn't leave Helen in the evening), a visit to the
cinema. The cinema she regarded as quite miraculous, and
especially were miraculous the lovely faces of the young women in
these pictures.</p>
<p>She was in fact thoroughly urban. She regarded this little
section of London in which she lived as her own especial village.
She still enjoyed a wonderful strength for walking. Her legs were
as sturdy as they had been at thirty. When someone said to her
once that he hated London because it was so huge, she said:
'Huge! Nonsense! Why, in our village we can cover everything in
about five minutes.'</p>
<p>'Village?' he answered. 'I was talking about London.'</p>
<p>'So was I,' she said. 'I was talking about Curzon Street
village.'</p>
<p>'Oh . . .' he said. 'But I live in Bloomsbury.'</p>
<p>'Well, there's Bloomsbury village and Inns of Court village
and Chelsea village and Camden Town village and Hampstead village
and--heaps more. The best is, you can go out any evening and do
what you like in another village, and no one in your own village
will know where you are or what you are doing.'</p>
<p>Every stone, window-curtain, piece of glass, doorknob in
Shepherd Market was known to her, or so she liked to think. She
did all the shopping herself. Nearly every man, woman and child
in the place knew her, and although she wore funny outdoor hats,
tweed skirts, and her nose was often shiny, everyone respected
and liked her. Her nickname in Shepherd Market was Aunt Sally,
but when she spoke to them you would think, by their deference,
that she was Queen of Sheba.</p>
<p>Late in February on an early afternoon she was eating a little
cold chicken and potato salad on a tray near the fire (for Helen,
who had a little cold, was in bed for the day) when the bell rang
and the little maid introduced Dodie Pullet. The girl was a great
friend of Millie's, who confided to her all her troubles and told
her often frank stories which Millie took with the calm of a
veteran life-studier.</p>
<p>To-day Dodie did not pause and smile, as she might have done,
at the odd little figure with her skirts pulled up, her feet on
the fender, enjoying a chicken-bone in her fingers.</p>
<p>'Come in, dear. It's all right. Queen Victoria did it.' Then
quickly as it were from her sharp, intelligent eyes: 'Is anything
the matter, dear?'</p>
<p>'It's only--' Dodie was catching her breath as though she had
been running. 'Smoke hasn't been here, has he?'</p>
<p>'No. . . . Have some coffee.'</p>
<p>'Thanks.' She drew a chair to the fire. 'Where's Helen?'</p>
<p>'Got a bit of a cold, so I kept her in bed. Why <i>should</i>
Smoke be here?'</p>
<p>'Oh, no reason. Thanks, dear. It's nice and warm in here. Our
room's so cold somehow. Only we had a word or two before he went
out and--well, the truth is, whenever we've had a word and he
goes out I get frightened. He's so fearfully depressed and it
goes on week after week. And now I'm out of a job too. We shall
<i>have</i> to leave here, which Smoke hates, and it's hard luck
on Fred too, because even if he's a month or two without a let it
will tell on him heavily. Besides, we're all so happy here as we
are. We'll never find another place like it; and then the
Delaneys are so cheerful, and you're so sweet, and even Patrick
upstairs . . .' Then Dodie did what Millie Pake had never seen
her do before; she burst into tears. She put her thin arm against
her face like a little child. She was wearing such a beautiful
smart frock too, black with white wings across the breasts, and
her make-up would certainly be ruined. . . .</p>
<p>Millie put down her coffee-cup, took her feet off the fender,
drew her chair to Dodie's and put her arm around the girl's
slender body.</p>
<p>'There, there, my dear! Smoke's all right and you'll get a job
with the greatest of ease.'</p>
<p>Dodie looked up, felt for her case, discovered a minute
pocket-handkerchief, groaned with horror at her face in the
little mirror.</p>
<p>'Oh, damn! I haven't cried for years! Only it <i>is</i>
getting awful with Smoke. He's jealous, suspicious, sore with me
about anything, with himself about everything. Poor Smoke! But I
tell you, Millie, it's hell having no money. Hell. He's got it
into his head that I will be sleeping with somebody for cash.
Well, I won't. He needn't worry. And then he's jealous of Patrick
Munden. He hates him because he says he's a Bolshie and doesn't
wash. But there's a lot to be said for Bolshevism anyway, and if
you're clever and have got ideas what does it matter whether you
wash or no? But money's the real trouble. We'll <i>have</i> to
move, but this address is so useful. . . . Oh, blast! isn't life
bloody? Sorry, Millie, I know you hate my swearing.'</p>
<p>Millie was holding Dodie's cold hand in her warm one.</p>
<p>'Swear if it helps you, my dear. Have you talked to Meg?'</p>
<p>'No. She'd want to give me some money. They haven't got any
too much themselves. Besides, Meg--' She stopped. 'You know how
she is. She's the kindest, most generous creature in the world,
but she's happy however miserable you are. I don't mean that she
doesn't sympathize, but I don't think she's ever been unhappy
herself. She lives in this world plus another one. I don't mean
spiritual. They are <i>both</i> material. She's out-size, and
one's shy of bringing one's ordinary made-to-pattern size in
comparison. You're not out-size, Millie darling.'</p>
<p>'No, I'm not--certainly not.'</p>
<p>Dodie got up.</p>
<p>'I must go and see if Smoke's back. If only he'd sleep--'</p>
<p>'Doesn't he?'</p>
<p>'He's very bad just now. He says he's afraid he'll dream.' She
turned, smiling. 'You always do me good. I don't quite know why.
But it's a beastly world, isn't it? Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin. So
much hatred. Money and food not distributed properly. No one
knowing where they're going.'</p>
<p>'I think,' said Millie, 'we all know too much. And hear too
much too. It's like Blind Man's Buff--someone always touching
you, and you turn round, stretch your hands out, and there's no
one there. Also I shouldn't wonder if we aren't being made less
stout than we used to be. Pepys went out to see half London
burning and then went home and added up his accounts. And I think
we all expect happiness as our right. We usen't to.'</p>
<p>'Good-bye. I expect things will be fine soon.'</p>
<p>After she had gone, Millie sat there thinking. Strange how
difficult it was to help anybody else! Strange, too, how money
was everyone's trouble. After these thousands of years human
beings should have discovered a plan whereby everyone had enough,
and then they could all put the money problem aside and consider
many more important things.</p>
<p>She went into the little bedroom to see how Helen was and
found her fast asleep, so she called the maid and told her to
keep her eyes and ears open, put on her hat and a strange green
mantle for which she had a great affection, took her stout
umbrella with which she always walked, and started
downstairs.</p>
<p>She had suddenly the idea that she would go and visit 'poor'
Claude Willoughby. Herself and Helen always thought of him as
'poor' Claude, not because he <i>was</i> poor, but because they
felt a kindness for him that had a touch of patronage about
it--or perhaps it was only the pitying kindness that all women
feel for their bachelor friends. She had never before visited
Claude in his rooms and she was surprised at herself for doing so
now. Dodie's visit had touched her and made her want to be of
some use. As she left the house she felt as though all the
inhabitants there were advancing towards some sort of drama. The
mild February day that suggested swollen streams, snowdrops and a
crocus or two in the country, made Shepherd Market a little
shabby and muffled. Everything in the shops looked rather
second-rate and there were more slinking cats than usual. It
seemed therefore quite in the nature of things that the door in
White Horse Street should be opened to her by quite the most
unpleasant-looking man she had ever seen in her life. She knew
who it was--Claude had often mentioned his landlord. She loathed
Brocket on sight, and disliked him all the more that he could
rouse such violent feeling in her.</p>
<p>'Is Mr. Claude Willoughby at home, please?'</p>
<p>Although her clothes were old-fashioned there was something in
Millie Pake's voice that Brocket instantly recognized. He hadn't
been a gentleman's servant all his days without knowing a lady
when he saw one, and among his many characteristics was snobbery
of a very violent kind.</p>
<p>'Step inside and I'll see,' he said. The hall was dark,
stuffy, and smelt of onions and dead geraniums. ''Oo shall I
say?' he asked.</p>
<p>'Lady Mildred Pake, if you please.'</p>
<p>'Yes, m'lady.'</p>
<p>He was the eager, obliging, die-for-you-if-you-ask-it English
servant. Very like, Millie thought, that butler we once had who
had a mania for stealing Helen's clothes.</p>
<p>Brocket seized a trumpet hanging on the wall and shouted,
'Lady Mildred Pake, sir,' then, after a pause, breathing like an
eager retriever, he said:</p>
<p>'Mr. Willoughby's in. 'E'll be delighted to see you, m'lady.
I'll show you 'is room. Pardon me.' He led the way, and Millie
followed the flapping slippers.</p>
<p>'Well, Claude,' she said in her rather hoarse voice.</p>
<p>He was standing, expecting her, and she noticed that he had a
little egg on his upper lip and that his scanty hair was ruffled
over his thin pate. Brocket had shut the door and vanished. 'What
a horrible man!'</p>
<p>'Who? Brocket? . . . Oh yes, he isn't nice at all. Millie, I'm
so glad to see you. I was snoozing in that chair and you're my
dream . . . really you are!'</p>
<p>She tapped his cheek.</p>
<p>'Come to pay you a little visit. Sit down where you were and
let's be cosy. . . . No, I won't take your chair! Here, let me do
your fire up a bit.'</p>
<p>Her old knees cracked a little as she bent forward, but she
was full of energy as she took the coal off the scuttle, piled it
high, broke it up with the poker and made a bright blaze.</p>
<p>Claude watched her in an agony. How could she know that that
coal in the scuttle was all that he had for the rest of the day
and that now he must go shivering to bed? He was, however, too
much of a gentleman to say anything.</p>
<p>'There!' said Millie, giving the last lump a vigorous smack.
'That's better! I don't know what you have such a miserable fire
for on a day like this!'</p>
<p>She drew the little cane-bottomed chair forward and sat there
with her broad-toed shoes on the fender in her favourite
attitude.</p>
<p>She looked at Claude. Poor little man, he didn't look at all
well. How she wished she could tell him about the egg on his lip!
But she couldn't, of course she couldn't. And she would like some
tea. It was early--a quarter past three--nevertheless on an
afternoon like this. . . . But she realized that tea would be
difficult for Claude and would involve, probably, the summoning
of that horrible man again. But he would be expecting that she
would demand it, so she said, rubbing her hands together, her
rings flashing their diamonds in the blaze: 'I've only looked in
for a moment. Helen's got a bit of a cold, so I've kept her in
bed, and I said to myself, "I'll go and see how Claude is!" Most
unmaidenly of me' (Millie had a charming laugh--melodious and
rich, with a rather quizzing humour), 'but we're old enough,
Claude, aren't we, not to need a chaperon? Now you're not to
suggest tea. I've only just had lunch and I shall probably drop
in for a cup with Meg Delaney. The days when Helen is in bed are
visiting days.'</p>
<p>He, on his side, thought what a funny old thing <i>she</i> was
with her ugly hat a little askew, her rough old face so innocent
of cosmetics, that queer green cape, her thick legs, her
broad-toed shoes--yet if she walked into the middle of a hostile
African tribe, they would know her at once for someone
important.</p>
<p>The rings on her rather stubby red fingers were old and
magnificent but looked absolutely right on her and not at all
incongruous with her queer clothes. He looked at the rings rather
enviously. After all, she and Helen could never be really 'up
against it' while she had those rings, and he expected that there
were plenty of other old family treasures as well. But he was
delighted to see her. While she was there, sitting opposite to
him, looking so thoroughly at home, his world was more secure and
he need not fear the enemy.</p>
<p>They chatted for a while very amiably on world affairs,
wondering about the Saar and whether Germany was to be trusted
and what Hitler was like really, and then something about the
<i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> and wouldn't it be better for the money
to be spent on the poor, and so to the 'pictures,' and Millie had
seen some photographs of <i>Little Women</i> which she had read
over and over again as a girl, and had Claude read <i>A Rose in
June,</i> which of course he'd never heard of, and so to more
personal things--Princess Corleone, Helen's cold, and was Claude
comfortable where he was?</p>
<p>'As I've said, that's a horrid man who brought me up
here.'</p>
<p>'Yes.' Claude dropped his voice and looked about the room. 'As
a matter of fact something very unpleasant is happening.'</p>
<p>'Tell me about it. Perhaps I can help,' said Millie.</p>
<p>'Well--he's accusing me of stealing things.'</p>
<p>'Accusing <i>you?</i> My dear Claude!'</p>
<p>'Yes, really. A little while ago it was some bath salts
belonging to a man called Pierson. You see, we share a
bathroom--a very uncomfortable situation, but there it is. And
one day Brocket came up here and said Pierson had missed some
bath salts. He didn't actually <i>accuse</i> me, of course, but I
was the only other person who shared the bathroom. And then only
yesterday he brought up some coals and said that two library
books had been left by Best, another tenant, down in the hall and
had vanished.'</p>
<p>'But do you mean to say that he insinuated that you--?'</p>
<p>'Oh, of course he said nothing directly. But you don't know
how he looks at me, Millie, and every day he seems to come
nearer. I'm afraid of his touching me.'</p>
<p>'Touching you?'</p>
<p>'Oh, not assaulting me or doing anything violent, but just
simply touching me. I couldn't bear it. I dream of it at night.
If he laid a finger on me I'd be sick.'</p>
<p>'Poor Claude,' she thought, 'he certainly doesn't look well. I
don't believe he has enough to eat. He's so very thin.'</p>
<p>'You've been too much alone here, Claude. That's been the
trouble. You must come and see Helen and me more. And the
Delaneys. I'm sure they'd be delighted to see you.'</p>
<p>'Yes. Young Delaney's been very kind to me already. He took me
to a party the other night.'</p>
<p>'That was nice for you.'</p>
<p>'Well, it wasn't really. I didn't know anybody, and towards
the end a man spoke who frightened me out of my life.'</p>
<p>'Frightened you?'</p>
<p>'Yes. He said about what the world was going to be very
shortly--Communism, you know. Of course I'd heard people talk
like that before, but this man was different. He really made you
feel that it was true what he said. It was most unpleasant. No
personal freedom. No marriages. But it wasn't the details. It was
the way he looked. I felt as though I were being stood up against
the wall and ordered to be shot there and then.' He smiled. 'Not
that it would matter--an old man like me.'</p>
<p>There was something very sweet and touching about Claude,
Millie decided. He had a kind of heroism somewhere although he
wasn't very brave. But how could you be brave when you were over
seventy and had no money and not enough to eat? But she realized
that he was, even in these hard times, one of those who cared
more for others than himself.</p>
<p>'Now, Claude, listen.' She got up and stood looking at him,
menacing him with her finger. 'You've been much too much alone.
Don't you think you haven't got any friends, because you've got
plenty. And don't worry about the future. Take things day by day.
Because the War was so bad, people think the future must be bad
too. It doesn't follow at all. The Lord does things in His own
way and His own time.'</p>
<p>I wish the Lord had told her not to use all my coal, he
couldn't help thinking; nevertheless he was delighted with her
visit, felt ever so much better for it. He wished he could ask
her to stay a little longer, but he didn't dare.</p>
<p>Millie did then a thing she had never done before. She went
and kissed Claude on the cheek.</p>
<p>He was tremendously affected, and they stood for a moment
together, his hand on her arm.</p>
<p>He didn't speak, and she just nodded and went away.</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c108" id="c108">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>
<h2>THE THUNDERSTORM</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There may be one or two who remember a very curious
thunderstorm on an early March London afternoon in this year
1934.</p>
<p>Why should a thunderstorm that did not last longer than twenty
minutes remain in anyone's memory? Well, in part because it
sprang out of the bluest, most springlike of afternoon skies. Few
people look upwards in London, and perhaps there was no one who
saw a cloud, like a blot of ink on a blue tablecloth, spread out
of the chimney-pots of Lambeth, throw a cold grey patch over the
Thames, turn like a flat crab on to its back and spread out its
claws over the Houses of Parliament. The day was March in that
there was a wind, but out of the wind, in Shepherd Market, for
instance, or under the eaves of the new Curzon Picture-house it
was almost as hot as summer. In the Strand the traffic suddenly
piled up to an obstinate halt. The Town just here seemed for a
moment to stand quite still, as though all the newspapers in
Fleet Street were listening for news. High up in the National
Portrait Gallery, all amongst the Elizabethans, an old gentleman
in a chair went fast asleep and a beam of sun struck Mary of
Scots on the mouth so that she seemed to smile at him. Very
pretty. But in the Old Kent Road, coming up the steps of the
lavatory, were two gentlemen arguing about the Royal Family.
'Bloomin' waste of the people's money, that's wot it is. Wot good
does it do? That's wot I'm askin' you.'</p>
<p>'It's a symbol,' said the other gentleman, wiping his mouth
with the back of his hand. 'It's a symbol. That's what it is.
Look at the ruddy sun. Warm as summer.'</p>
<p>A novelist can go on with this sort of thing, of course, for
ever and ever. There are the two dogs in Battersea Park, for
instance; and the Princess Corleone coming out of Claridge's and
feeling an ache under her left arm and wondering about it; and
then the soldier on duty outside St. James's Palace, stamping his
feet as he turns and thinking of the new friend he's just made
with the posh rooms in Jermyn Street; and there's the chauffeur
of Lord Pondicherry who's hoping to persuade his master to get a
new Alvis instead of his ancient Daimler, and there'd be a
commission too, wouldn't there? Well, as I mean to say, there are
a great many people in London, and it's all very easy, as so many
writers, nice agreeable men and women, have found in the last ten
years. There's the stream of consciousness too. <i>That's</i>
very easy because one thought <i>does</i> lead to another, as Mr.
Sterne discovered ever so many years ago. . . . Well, the thing
is to cover a lot of paper--that is, if you want to pay your
income tax. But what do you do if you happen to be dealing with
real people? Real to oneself, that is. The people are the thing.
For instance, Kitty and Alton truly <i>were</i> there on that
afternoon of the thunderstorm. You can't dislodge them, walking
down the slope of the Green Park in the warm sunshine. That
wilderness of walls, towers and chimneys hems them in.</p>
<p>If you are very modern you will hold them to be no more than
two fish swimming at the bottom of a green tank. But they are, in
my opinion, much more. They have a passionate wonder, a
glittering expectation. Alton, at least, is happy as he has never
been in his life before, because he is telling Kitty about his
play. It isn't only a play, of course. It is filled with all the
things that his soul has collected during the years of his soul's
experience. They are not as yet very original things, except the
bit about the young man facing the six old men in the Library and
discovering that they are all himself. Kitty thought <i>that</i>
original although it was probably in Shaw somewhere. He had
brought a penny exercise-book and read her some dialogue from it.
She wondered that, with the little experience he had had, the
dialogue should be so real.</p>
<p>But of course she was absorbed by the young man himself. She
was not at all intellectual and always preferred people to
literature. And he was quite a new person to her. She had never,
for one thing, given anyone such shining, unspoilt pleasure
before, and all her life it had been her wish to give people
pleasure. She walked along, her tall slim body strong and free,
feeling the warm sun on her face and knowing that sense of
independent co-ordinated joyousness that is the grandest thing in
life. At that moment she bore no one in the world a grudge, had
no inhibitions nor regrets.</p>
<p>'The old man blows his nose. The curtain falls,' cried Alton
triumphantly.</p>
<p>'Is that the end of the first act?'</p>
<p>'Oh no. The third scene.'</p>
<p>'Is it wise to bring the curtain down in the middle of the
act?'</p>
<p>'It's always done now. Cinema technique.'</p>
<p>'I see.'</p>
<p>Strange how very different he was now, consumed by this Art
and therefore confident, strong, vibrating with ambition.</p>
<p>'Of course it will only appeal to special people. I mean that
I'm interested in it because I'm interested in <i>you,</i> but if
someone said quite casually, "Let's go to the play to-night," and
we went to your play, and the first thing we saw was an attic
with a girl feeding a mouse just out of its hole--by the way,
what would you do about the mouse? Will you have a real one?'</p>
<p>'Oh, the mouse is only symbolic.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but it has to be there. Some mouse has to be.'</p>
<p>What she liked about him was that he was not at all sulky at
criticism, as she believed so many artists were. He smiled
cheerfully.</p>
<p>'You think the play's rotten?'</p>
<p>'No, no. Of course I don't. Only I told you at the beginning I
had no brains--about the Arts, I mean. I hate poems that I can't
understand at the very first look, and novels where there's no
story and no one you can like, and pictures made of fur and
pieces of string. I don't apologize for that. <i>Very</i> modern
movements always appeal to a small group. If everyone liked them
at once there'd be no one for the new artists to fight.'</p>
<p>'What <i>do</i> you like in the Arts, then?'</p>
<p>'Let me see. In the theatre I go as far as Tchekov, but I must
say I like a good farce or revue better. In novels I like Dickens
and the <i>Old Wives' Tale</i> and Stella Benson. In poetry Keats
and Robert Bridges and Housman. But I like life much better than
books. That sounds priggish, doesn't it? but it's true. For
instance, what do you feel like when an old woman comes into your
shop and wastes half an hour of your time and doesn't buy
anything?'</p>
<p>'Oh, that's part of my job.'</p>
<p>'With your love for the country, don't you get mad with
impatience and want to rush off and marry a nice girl and live in
the country?'</p>
<p>'I've never thought of marriage. I've never been in love.'</p>
<p>'Nor have I. Not for more than a minute. Look at that cloud!
How sudden! There wasn't a sign of it a minute ago.'</p>
<p>Then he asked her a question.</p>
<p>'What do <i>you</i> want to do with <i>your</i> life? I
mean--what do you think it's all <i>for</i>?'</p>
<p>'What a terrible question! I don't know. I love being alive,
but then I'm healthy and have friends. I think that I expect that
something will happen that will change everything--all in a
moment!'</p>
<p>'Here <i>is</i> something!' he cried. 'It's caught us!'</p>
<p>For there was a flash that flung the grass, the trees, the
sheep, into a frenzy of unreal light, then a peal of thunder that
seemed to roar at themselves personally as though announcing to
them some fearful news; then the rain, shattering down, gates of
water descending.</p>
<p>'Oh, run, run! . . . You'll be soaked! This tree--'</p>
<p>'A tree's the worst place! That's where people are killed. . .
.'</p>
<p>But they stood there nevertheless although the tree had no
leaves. They stood there, both together. The storm took the Park
into his hands and worried at it as a dog worries a rag.</p>
<p>'It doesn't matter.' She put her hand on his shoulder. 'I was
soaked through in the first moment. Home isn't far. I like
storms.'</p>
<p>Their faces were stung with the rain.</p>
<p>He turned and kissed her wet cheek.</p>
<p>He began incoherently to speak.</p>
<p>'That settles it. I can never speak to you again. I've done
it. I knew I would. Before I came out I saw the danger. I've seen
it for weeks. And I'd have managed if it hadn't been for this. .
. . The rain, the rain. . . . Good-bye. Good-bye. You'll never
forgive me. But I'm not what you think. I'm better--far better.
I'll prove myself. . . . You'll see. . . . You'll see. . . .'</p>
<p>And waving his arms like a madman, he started running across
the Park. The rain whirled all about him as though he were at the
heart of a waterspout travelling with him. He ran. He ran. He was
gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Millie had often noticed that when her sister Helen lived very
vividly in the past, their room seemed to sink back with her,
throwing off any modernity (it never had very much) and rising,
as a transformation scene does in a pantomime, with all the
feeling, colour and sentiment of King Edward VII. The very chairs
and tables seemed to alter. One old woman's spoken words were
enough. No wonder the Witch of Endor had had so lasting a
reputation.</p>
<p>'It's so lovely a day you might almost go out, Helen.'</p>
<p>'You go out, dear. You sit in here with me far too much. When
the sun shines like this I'm walking on the lawns at Longleat. Do
you remember that house-party when Kitto Baines shot the peacock
at two in the morning? Poor peacock--and you thought I was going
to marry Kitto. You were quite frightened. As though I'd have
dreamt of such a thing. . . . Or did I?'</p>
<p>She got up slowly from her chair and walked, leaning on her
stick, to the window. How handsome she was, Millie thought, even
now! That carriage of the head was superb and that straight back,
a back famous through England once. Millie remembered how
miserably jealous she had been in the old days. Why could she
also not have had a straight back, and then Kitto Baines . . .?
Following her sister to the window, she shook her head and then
laughed.</p>
<p>'How absurd!' she said aloud.</p>
<p>'What's absurd?' said Helen, not turning her head but staring
at the sun as though she could not have enough of it.</p>
<p>'I was thinking of Kitto. I was in love with him once, and
dreadfully jealous of you, Helen darling. How silly it seems now!
And poor Kitto . . .'</p>
<p>Faintly they heard a peal of thunder.</p>
<p>'Was that thunder?'</p>
<p>'It couldn't be. A fine day like this.'</p>
<p>'It was. There it is again. Nearer now.'</p>
<p>'Come away from the window, Helen. You never know.'</p>
<p>'Never know what?'</p>
<p>'Oh, lightning or something.'</p>
<p>'Nonsense. What a goose you are, Millie! How dark the room is
suddenly!'</p>
<p>'I'll turn the lights on.'</p>
<p>'No. No. I like it like this.'</p>
<p>Millie gave a little scream. 'Oh, what a flash! Do come away
from the window, Helen.'</p>
<p>'No. I should think not. I love it. Something's happening.
Nature shows her scorn of us. That's what I like about a
thunderstorm always. Contempt. That's what thunder is. I'd like
to die standing at a window in a thunderstorm.'</p>
<p>Millie put her arm through her sister's.</p>
<p>'We'll die together, then.'</p>
<p>'Listen to the rain! Do you remember, Millie, being caught in
the rain on the moors near Glencoe? Do you remember sheltering in
the hut like King Lear, and Kitto saying "Poor Tom's a-cold"?
That was the day I was near to accepting him. If the storm had
lasted a minute longer . . . But you were there. You saved me
that afternoon. As you've saved me again and again. Oh, what
grand rain! What grand, grand rain! It brings me back to my
senses, Millie. Sitting there by the fire day after day I don't
know where I am half the time. I'm going, going . . . and soon
I'll be gone. But standing up to the weather like this I'm all
alive again. Listen! It's passing. That peal was more distant.
But how dark the room is! I can only just see your face.' She
turned towards Millie, leaned down a little, and they stood cheek
to cheek. Then slowly together they moved back to the fire.</p>
<p>'Shall I turn the lights on?'</p>
<p>'No. No.' Helen sank slowly into her chair. 'There. It will
soon be over. Perhaps my last thunderstorm. "Poor Tom's a-cold."
Do you remember how Kitto said it, looking at me?'</p>
<p>Millie smiled. 'That's better. The room's lighter already. And
now we'll have some tea.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'Help yourself.'</p>
<p>It was clear that Captain Coventry had been already helping
<i>himself</i> and now was charming, a little unsteady on his
feet and clearly amused at Bullock's diminutive stature. Or so
Bullock thought. But it didn't matter what the Captain thought.
Lizzie, his daughter, sat in the shabby armchair by the window.
It was a dreary room and smelt of tobacco and spirits.</p>
<p>The Captain stood there and entertained his guest. 'Very glad
to see you, Delaney. Lovely day, isn't it?'</p>
<p>When Bullock had arrived, ten minutes ago, there had been a
most unpleasant woman leaning with one arm on the mantelpiece.
She was handsome in a kind of violent insolent way. She was heavy
under the eyes, over-painted, running to seed. She had been
introduced to Bullock as Mrs. Agar. And there had been a queer,
brown-faced, black-haired little fellow who, looking like a
half-caste, brought in the drinks. Coventry called him Abel.
Bullock noticed all these things because the child in the window
was his own. That was what he had now the certainty of! He had
met her three times--at the party and twice here. On the first
occasion in this room it had been but for a moment, for they were
just going out, she and her father. Coventry had apologized but
had made no pretence of staying in. The child had said not a
word. So, with these very brief encounters, Bullock was absurdly
certain that he had rights over her, that he must care for and
protect her, when she had given no sign whatever that she wanted
to be protected.</p>
<p>And this was a horrid place. It was here that Coventry held
his gambling parties. There were copies of French prints on the
walls, an attempt, in the curtains, the fireplace, the sofa, at
gay colours; but over everything a film of staleness. Coventry
was laughing at him. Well, it didn't matter.</p>
<p>'It's very kind of you, Mr. Delaney, to call on us. Liz
appreciates it. Don't you, Liz?'</p>
<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>
<p>Bullock went over to her.</p>
<p>'I wondered whether you'd let me take you out for a drive,
Miss Coventry. It's a lovely day.'</p>
<p>'You go, Liz. It will do you good.'</p>
<p>She looked up at Bullock and smiled--a ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>'We have some friends coming . . . haven't we, Father?'</p>
<p>'Oh, they don't matter. Go along now.'</p>
<p>At that instant the light disappeared from the room as though
it had been shut off by a dropped curtain.</p>
<p>Coventry went to the window.</p>
<p>'It's going to rain, by Jove! That's sudden. Thunder! Did you
hear that, Lizzie?'</p>
<p>Lightning flashed and the room was for a fragment of time
really revealed. Bullock would never forget that. The white paste
of Coventry's cheek with the red patches, the furniture as though
it were of papier mâché. Coventry said:</p>
<p>'I must close the window in the other room. It will rain like
hell in a minute.'</p>
<p>Lizzie Coventry had sprung up and, with the strangest gesture
of helplessness, she had flung out her hands. Bullock caught her
arm. She trembled.</p>
<p>'Thunder! I hate it! I'm silly, but once in Venice--'</p>
<p>He put his arm round her.</p>
<p>'Look here. Don't be frightened. I don't mean only the
thunder. I'll look after you. You're only a kid. You oughtn't to
be here. I'm your friend now and always. Don't be angry.'</p>
<p>The thunder crashed as though it were in the very middle of
the room. He saw her face, a child's, terrified, her eyes large
and distended.</p>
<p>And she had been frightened before. It was as though he had
seen her standing like this in some other room. As though he saw
it in a crystal or a mirror.</p>
<p>The thunder crashed again and, without knowing what she was
doing, she pressed her little body against his. Bullock heard
Coventry's voice and found that he was standing close to
them.</p>
<p>'Liz is always like that when there's thunder about. It's all
right, darling. It will be over in a minute. God, listen to the
rain. Who'd have thought it five minutes ago!'</p>
<p>The room was dark. The rain lashed the panes. Lizzie bent down
and picked up her book. Without a word she sat down in the chair
and began to read.</p>
<p>'I remember once, Mr. Delaney,' Coventry began, and Bullock
thought how charming his voice was--'Lizzie and I were in
Vienna--know Vienna?--anyway it was a summer's day and we were
sitting outside a café, when there was a cloudburst very like
this one. It was the time when they had no money--you carried
your cash about in a bag. Well, as I was saying . . .'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'Oh, I don't hold with it!' Lady Pender urged the passionate
words between her tight lips as though they were weighted with
gold. 'No, indeed I don't.'</p>
<p>'She's a terribly stupid woman,' Meg thought, 'and she detests
me.' Also the family were behaving very badly, for Meg had made
them all promise that they would be there--this the first
occasion on which the Penders had come to tea. Bullock had said
that he would see a publisher and hurry then straight home. Kitty
was meeting a friend. ('Bring them back to tea,' Meg had said.
'Oh no, Mother, I don't think they'd mix with the Penders.' 'How
do you know? You haven't seen the Penders.' 'Oh, but I do know.'
'Very well, dear, have it your own way.') Well, but who
<i>would</i> mix with Lady Pender? <i>What</i> a stupid woman!
She was called Evelyn. She was dressed too in a kind of
black-and-yellow snakeskin, something quite unsuited to her
sallow complexion. 'Of course, being out in the East so long you
<i>do</i> get sallow,' Meg thought.</p>
<p>'They'll be in. They'll be in any minute,' Meg cried joyfully,
looking at her beloved Graham. She couldn't help it. He was her
beloved now as he had been all those years ago. It was quite
possible to love two people at one and the same time.</p>
<p>She would tell Fred all about it. She would say: 'He's so
clever, Fred. There's simply <i>nothing</i> he doesn't know,
<i>and</i> he's so sweet. He always had the sweetest nature. He
talks in the voice of all the poets, soft, gentle, with every
word distinct and full of meaning. Now <i>you,</i> Fred, often
don't know <i>what</i> the words you mispronounce really do
mean.'</p>
<p>Graham was thin, brown and exceedingly distinguished, while
Fred was burly, florid, and would be too fat if he didn't look
out. Not that she was making comparisons between the two men.</p>
<p>She loved them both, that was all, and how splendid to have
<i>two</i> men to love at her time of life! She knew too that
Graham was in love with <i>her</i> again. He was saying to
himself, 'Why ever did I marry that thin, grumpy . . .?' or
wasn't he?</p>
<p>Here Meg pulled herself up, yes, just as she was persuading
Evelyn Pender to the little paste sandwiches. She mustn't harm
anyone. She mustn't do an unkindness to anyone. Everyone must be
happy. With the sun pouring in through the window and dear Graham
sitting there, so gently, so comfortably, how could one
<i>not</i> be happy?</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't hold with it!' Lady Pender had cried. 'Let the
natives once get out of hand and it's good-bye to the British
Empire!' Saying this she tossed her head, clicked her teeth
almost as though they were little castanets, and, with a wave of
her sandwich, commanded all the natives of India back into their
jungle.</p>
<p>'It's too bad,' said Meg, who was always bored with the
British Empire. (The trouble was, she never could see it! She
tried to sometimes, shutting her eyes very tight, but all she
collected were rolling brown rivers, miles of forest and a
missionary.) 'They promised me. Fred is good about keeping his
word too. Isn't the sun lovely? Graham, do you remember the sun
that day on the Thames? That summer day when Margery Thawe fell
into the river--on purpose, of course, because it was young Elton
rescuing her that made him propose. Dear me, dear me, what a
<i>long</i> time ago!'</p>
<p>She wasn't, she reflected, being very tactful to Evelyn, and
at once, knowing that she had done her a wrong, felt warmth
towards her, would have given her anything she possessed, longed
to tell her that that black-and-yellow snakeskin was the very
worst kind of colour. So she laid her hand for a moment on Lady
Pender's shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>'You'll call me Meg, won't you? Everyone does.'</p>
<p>Lady Pender smiled a tight shoe-pinching smile. 'Yes. Of
course. My real friends call <i>me</i> Evie.'</p>
<p>Graham had been very silent. Only now, looking up at Meg's
very simple friendly gaze, seeing her bathed in sunlight, he
remarked.</p>
<p>'I like this room. It's happy somehow.'</p>
<p>'Yes. It is happy,' Meg said. 'It's the house. Fred loves this
house as though it were a live thing--Delaneys have lived in it
for years and years. We're always afraid we may have to sell it.
They want it for flats and are offering a splendid price. As it
is we let all the floors and to such nice people. They're all
friends of ours. But if one flat were empty we wouldn't be able
to manage it. It's a tight squeeze as it is. Try one of those
marzipan things, Evie. They're so good. Yes, we hope for the best
though. We're an optimistic lot, we Delaneys. Why--where's the
sun gone to?'</p>
<p>She moved to the window, and a moment later a flash cut the
room as a knife cuts paper.</p>
<p>Lady Pender was quite unmoved. She took another marzipan cake
and began to nibble at it, giving it a little careful look
between each nibble. Meg went to Graham's side. They stood close
together, looking out into the darkness, hearing the peals of
thunder, then watching the sheets of determined rain. They did
not speak.</p>
<p>Lady Pender finished her cake and looked at them. She stared
at the broad back and the thin one. Then, finding her
handkerchief, she carefully wiped her lips, looked into a small
mirror in her heavy black bag, patted her hair. Then, once again,
she stared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fred Delaney was a little drunk. He had lunched with three old
friends at the Beef Tub, a small hostelry near Apple Tree Yard,
and he now saw life gloriously. He was quite steady on his legs,
knew just what he was saying, and if life were a trifle
intensified, a little more than real, wasn't that a splendid
thing? He <i>knew</i> that he was a little drunk. That was the
<i>good</i> thing. The trouble with drinking began when you
didn't know. His big body was vibrating with health and strength.
With one push of his big arm he could knock this whole shop to
pieces, and <i>wouldn't</i> it look a mess? Pushing his hat
straight, smiling with his fine Irish joviality into the
respectable tradesman's face, he handled the 'shirtings,'
pressing them between finger and thumb, finding them, one and
all, superb.</p>
<p>Inside his brain one or two notions were running about and he
found it difficult to catch and hold them. Dear old Meg, for
example, had asked him to be back for tea. Some people were
coming. He had promised. Well, he would keep his promise,
although he <i>had</i> stayed at the Beef Tub a bit later than he
had intended. Then he knew quite well that he had no right to be
ordering shirts in an expensive shop in Jermyn Street. In the
first place, he had enough shirts, and, in the second, he had no
right to buy in a shop like this. He simply hadn't the money.
Lastly, the mirrors in the shop annoyed him. There were so many
of them and, from where he was standing, however he turned, he
saw this big carroty-haired, blue-eyed familiar laughing at him.
The mirrors suggested that there were many more worlds than one,
and that was a suggestion he didn't care for. One was quite
enough for one man to manage! But was he only one man? Seen
side-face, his red cheek, his rounded chin, the broad shoulder,
the stout leg, here was a complete stranger! He swung about and
there was the familiar old Fred, reassuring him again, but that
stranger was still there. He must be there, hiding in another
mirror. And if there were many Freds, there were many shops and
many Londons. There were <i>strange</i> Londons and behind them
<i>strange</i> worlds. These mirrors were doors and one of them
might at any moment open. What would it then disclose? Some
brand-new world where, possibly, men walked about on their heads
and all the windows of the houses were flat to the street! He
laughed at this funny idea and went back to the counter to finger
the beautiful silk 'shirtings' again. He looked at the decorous
assistant very gravely.</p>
<p>'I was thinking,' he said, 'how funny it would be if windows
were flat with the street. If you walked on them and they
splintered. What a noise there'd be!'</p>
<p>'Yes, sir,' said the assistant gravely. 'This blue and grey is
very handsome. It makes up beautifully.'</p>
<p>'Like a film star,' said Fred, laughing heartily at his little
joke. Then, because his legs <i>were</i> a trifle unsteady, he
sat down on the hard round chair.</p>
<p>At that moment the door of the shop opened and a big heavy
tub-faced man entered. Fred knew him at once. It was Mr.
Bartlett, Mrs. Van Renn's young friend. Fred had met him twice at
the Van Renns' lately, and a duller ox of a man you wouldn't find
in a day's march through London. There he sat in the Van Renns'
little room, his legs spread, staring in front of him and saying:
'By Jove, yes,' or 'You don't mean it!' or 'That's a good one!'
He appeared not to have an idea in his head, and his only virtue
to Mrs. Van Renn must be, Fred supposed, that he had money and
was generous with it. That the lovely Miss Van Renn was bored
with him was probable, although what Miss Van Renn thought about
anything was never very clear.</p>
<p>However, Fred was feeling friendly to all the world, so from
his little chair he said very heartily, 'Hullo, Bartlett!'</p>
<p>Bartlett's heavy eyes regarded him with somnolent recognition.
'Hullo, Delaney!' Then he turned at once to the assistant and
said: 'Want some braces. Red and black stripes.' Then
apologetically to Fred: 'Hope I'm not butting in. You go
ahead.'</p>
<p>'No, old boy, of course not. Only having some shirts made up.
Grand day, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Grand day it is.'</p>
<p>Bartlett leaned on the counter, as though he would smash it to
powder.</p>
<p>'You're looking well, old man,' Fred said genially.</p>
<p>'Not so bad,' said Bartlett.</p>
<p>'Seen the Van Renns lately?'</p>
<p>'Yesterday. Was there yesterday.'</p>
<p>'Was it the dark red or the crimson you were wanting?' asked
the assistant.</p>
<p>'Hell! I don't know. Let's see them both,' said Bartlett.</p>
<p>Delaney studied genially that enormous back and thought to
himself: 'I've got a pretty figure beside this fellow.' He got
up, stretched himself and yawned.</p>
<p>'I'll be toddling.'</p>
<p>Bartlett didn't turn from the counter.</p>
<p>'So long, old man.'</p>
<p>'I'll be in again,' Fred said to the assistant and went gaily
out, leaving, thank God, all those disturbing mirrors behind
him.</p>
<p>He was disturbed nevertheless a trifle about Bartlett.
<i>Did</i> Alice Van Renn see anything in the oaf? She might. You
couldn't tell with her, and Fred was sore to confess that
Bartlett had most certainly spent more time with her than he,
Fred Delaney, had. For, to be honest, his times with her were
extremely brief, always broken into by something. She was for
ever going out or coming in when they were alone. Only when
others were there did she sit like an image, frozen to her
chair.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that he almost sailed along Piccadilly. His
hat a trifle on one side, his brown overcoat gaily open, humming
a tune, it was as though the world were his ship and he
commander.</p>
<p>And then, just as he passed the door of the Berkeley, where
the door-attendant, known to him, touched his cap ('A nice
fellow,' Delaney thought, 'I never saw anyone help ladies out of
taxis better'), there was a rumble as though a lion had growled.
He stopped at the crossing and looked up. Why, the sky was black!
An instant before and it had been a dancing shining blue. Never
mind. He had no umbrella and only a light overcoat, but he would
be home in no time. The lights changed, he hurried across, bought
a <i>Star</i> from the newspaper man, stood a moment looking at
the racing and seeing that the small-printed lines danced a
little before his eyes, when the very ground cracked at his feet.
He had not noticed the lightning and so the crash caught him the
more with surprise. He really looked at the pillars of the Ritz
as though he expected to see them topple forward. He was
curiously excited, with the sort of realization that one has
sometimes under an anaesthetic. 'By Jove, this <i>is</i> the
explanation of the Universe. I've got it at last!'--only Fred
said, and aloud: 'By Jove, the windows <i>are</i> all flat, and
I'm trampling on them!'</p>
<p>No one heard him, because now, with another peal, the rain
came down in torrents, with a glassy sound, his slightly
intoxicated brain thought, as though those mirrors were crashing
about him.</p>
<p>And he ran, a thing that a Londoner hates to do in public. But
he thought, 'I can be home in a minute if I run.' At the end of
Half Moon Street the rain was so torrential that he stood in the
portico of Number 90 for shelter. 'I'll wait,' he thought. 'It
will soon be over.' He stood there and, very composedly, opened
his paper. He saw a headline: 'London's Danger.' It was a leader
in the paper's centre. It began:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>There could have been no doubt, we imagine, in the
mind of anyone who heard the speeches made in the House of
Commons last night that the safety of London, in the advent of
another war, is far from secure. It may be that we are witnessing
the final moments of the London that we love. One Air Raid and,
so far as our present Air Protection goes, London will, perhaps,
lie in ruins. London, with her history, her art, her beauty . .
.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>He had read so far to the sound of thundering waters. It was
as though the sky had opened up and, in a frenzy of energy, the
Minor Gods were playing the game of the Deluge.</p>
<p>But he saw and felt more than the rain. Removed ever so
slightly from actual reality, he saw his beloved City lying, like
her windows, flat with the earth. A glittering moon filled his
eyes with ironic light, and into the heart of that glitter London
rose, her towers white like snow, softly grey like pigeons'
wings; the river stood on end spouting a column of water at the
cold moon's grin; walls were split and into the air poured the
débris of mankind, pictures and coal-scuttles, curtains and
fire-arms, 'Tobias and Sarah in Bed' from the Victoria and
Albert, Michael Angelo's 'Entombment' from the National Gallery,
Mr. Cochran's walking-stick, one of the lions from Trafalgar
Square, the air dark with shoes, hats, knives and forks, and the
wooden toy horses of a thousand nurseries.</p>
<p>London has fallen! And, after its fall, a great silence. Years
of silence--and at last, on a moonlight night so still in
comparison with the other, a bird's sleepy song, before with a
faint whirr of its wings it flies to the trees that envelop
Selfridge's bargain basement, where it folds itself to
slumber.</p>
<p>London! His London in peril! Of course. Of course. Why had he
not seen this before? Its loveliness, its pathos, its roughness
and ugliness and tragedy, its gaiety and humanity, its
inconsequence, its great multitude of ghosts, the very spirit of
its independence, the very helplessness of its appeal to be
loved, seemed to come to him as he stood there, and, being a
little drunk, he stretched out his arms and enfolded it.</p>
<p>'Come to me, my darling.' (And was it not perhaps wearing the
semblance of the lovely delicate body of Alice Van Renn?) 'I will
care for you, protect you, hide you from the invader.'</p>
<p>And then, for the rain was less severe, he almost tiptoed the
few steps home.</p>

<h2>WOMEN ARE MOTHERLY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Meg Delaney, as soon as she recognized that something had to
be done, immediately did it.</p>
<p>People who knew her moderately rather than well were often
surprised at the suddenness with which, out of what seemed a
cloud of absent-mindedness, she became, all in a moment,
practical and efficient. Only her own family knew that this was
so, and admired her for it.</p>
<p>She had realized for some time that something must be done
about Rudge, that Caesar, the family Ganymede. He was unhappy,
poor boy, and that she could not endure, because she was fond of
him.</p>
<p>But there was more in it than personal feeling. The family's
ease of mind depended very greatly upon Caesar. Without that boy
everything would be at sixes and sevens, because he was tireless,
methodical, devoted. Because he was devoted it seemed strange
that he should ask so obstinately for his wages to be raised. But
Meg did not make the mistake so often made by masters and
mistresses about those who work for them. She knew that Caesar
had a life of his own with many things in it that had nothing at
all to do with the Delaney lives. She knew above all that he was
demanding a rise because his old mother never let him alone on
this subject.</p>
<p>She knew too that Fred could not afford to give him a rise--no
rise at least that would satisfy old Mrs. Rudge. And she knew
that Caesar was so good and efficient a boy that he could easily
find a job elsewhere with better wages.</p>
<p>She knew that the boy loved the Delaneys, that his heart was
torn, and that, with a torn heart, you sleep badly, work
inefficiently and lose your temper. She did <i>not</i> know that,
to add to poor Caesar's burdens, he was, for the first time in
his life, most desperately in love. Meg was further aware that
this problem of Caesar was only one of many problems now
beginning to approach the Delaney happiness. It might be the
smallest of the problems or it might be the largest. In any case
she would at once attack it. She would go to the fountain-head,
and the fountain-head was old Mrs. Rudge.</p>
<p>She disliked Mrs. Rudge extremely, and it always upset her to
be with someone she disliked. She shared with Millie Pake the
belief that if you knew anyone very well you could not really
dislike them. Old Mrs. Rudge shook this belief, for the more
often that Meg saw her the more she disliked her. Mrs. Rudge was
often unwell. She possessed a mysterious Thing that she called
her Pain. No one knew quite what it was, for it moved about and
no doctor was able to put his finger on it. Meg privately
considered that its origins were in eating too much and never
taking any exercise. Mrs. Rudge also belonged to that Merry Old
England that regarded fresh air as a poison. Now, sitting in the
small room over the little shop in Shepherd Market, Meg felt
stifled as though she were living inside a camphor ball. She felt
also enormous physically, but spiritually inferior to Mrs.
Rudge.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rudge was a small woman wrapped in shawls. Her face was
covered with wrinkles, and out of the wrinkles there gleamed two
little eyes as sharp as pins. But for the eyes you would fancy
that she was a poor, weak, crumpled-up little woman whom life,
dealing in a series of mean revenges, had reduced to
helplessness. It was only her eyes and her voice, which had the
sharpness of a drill-instructor's, that showed that there was
life in the old girl yet. The room had in it many large
sea-shells, the model of a ship, and the dried skin of a baby
alligator, for her husband had been a sailor who had found
distant seas preferable to matrimony.</p>
<p>She watched her maritime possessions as though any and every
visitor had only one purpose in life, namely to rob her of them.
But then she watched everything. She resembled a detective in a
murder story who may, from the slightest clue, a shoe-lace, a
tea-spoon, a cigarette-end, discover the murderer. That the
murderer was somewhere about, Mrs. Rudge was always sure.</p>
<p>This suspicion made Meg horribly aware of her own bright
colours, her conversation, her spreading proportions. To-day she
was wearing quiet clothes, a black dress with silver bands at the
neck and wrists, and a black hat. But she had taken off her
gloves, and her rings glittered on her fingers. Mrs. Rudge's eyes
were fastened on the rings.</p>
<p>'Well, Mrs. Rudge, how are you? Pretty well, I hope.'</p>
<p>'No, mum, I can't say as I feel very well.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I'm sorry. What's the matter?'</p>
<p>'It's my Pain, mum.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry! What kind of a pain?'</p>
<p>'Round my 'eart--then the back of my neck, and then lower,
much lower.'</p>
<p>'How horrid for you! It sounds a little like indigestion.'</p>
<p>'Indigestion!' Mrs. Rudge was as scornful as though Meg had
suggested that she was a millionairess. 'Ah, well. Them that
'asn't got can't feel. That's what I always say. It's a burden to
be borne, and them's lucky that don't 'ave to bear it.'</p>
<p>'Well, I'm very sorry.' Meg knew that the preliminaries were
now over and that real conversation must begin. 'I think you're
very brave, Mrs. Rudge. Caesar tells me how brave you are. It's
about Caesar I looked in for a moment.'</p>
<p>The old lady seemed to stiffen as though she were suddenly all
muscle.</p>
<p>'Caesar, mum? 'E's giving satisfaction, I hope?'</p>
<p>'Of course he is--a very good boy.'</p>
<p>'Well, I 'opes he is. That's all. I'll tell you something,
Mrs. Belaney.' (It was one of Mrs. Rudge's characteristics that
she took a refined pleasure in never knowing anyone's name
correctly.) 'If that boy isn't giving satisfaction I don't know
any boy in the country 'oo would. That's all I 'ave to say.'</p>
<p>'Of course he is. Perfect satisfaction.' Meg laughed. 'The
trouble is that I'm afraid it's we who are not giving <i>him</i>
satisfaction. He's asking us to raise his wages.'</p>
<p>'Oh, 'e is, is 'e? First I've 'eard of it.'</p>
<p>(Horrible old liar, Meg thought.)</p>
<p>'We think,' Meg went on, 'that he is worth all he can get, of
course. He's a very good boy, <i>very</i> good boy indeed. The
sad thing is that we can't afford to pay him any more. As it is
we run the house with no margin, no margin at all.'</p>
<p>Now indeed Mrs. Rudge's little eyes did seem to flash fire.
There appeared even an ironical twist to the thin dried lips.
<i>This</i> woman with her fine black dress and diamond rings
saying she couldn't afford it! That was a good one. Oh, a very
good one indeed! She, Mrs. Rudge, hadn't once been lodge-keeper
at Wintersmoon for nothing.</p>
<p>'You know best, mum, of course. . . .'</p>
<p>'No, of course not. Caesar knows best what's right for his own
future. Only I came because I know the influence you have on him,
and perhaps you could show him that it would be wise to wait a
little and then we'll see what we can do.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Rudge's voice shook. She was in one of her famous
tempers.</p>
<p>'Excuse me, mum, but it don't seem right for a lady like you
to come 'ere be'ind the poor boy's back and suggest things to 'is
mother.'</p>
<p>'I'm not suggesting anything.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, you are, mum, excuse me. You knows well enough that
my poor boy works 'is fingers to skin and bone in your service
and 'as done ever since 'e was a little nipper. "Mother," 'e says
to me, "Mother, I'm that tired I could just lay me down and die.
Don't tell them, Mother," 'e says. "I don't want <i>them</i> to
know 'ow tired I am. They mean well," 'e says, "but they don't
think," 'e says, "they don't think of the long hours and the poor
food--"'</p>
<p>'He <i>doesn't</i> have poor food!' Meg broke in wildly.</p>
<p>'Ah, not as <i>you</i> sees it, mum. <i>You</i> mean well, no
doubt, but <i>you</i> don't see what goes on with that there
cook, Mrs. Banter--'</p>
<p>'Ganter!' Meg said. 'Ganter!'</p>
<p>'Ganter or Banter, it's all one as far as my poor boy and 'is
food goes. "Mother," 'e says when 'e comes 'ome, "Mother," 'e
says, "I may be the son of a sailor, Mother, but that ain't no
reason why I should eat what that Mrs. Banter gives me." And then
I cooks 'im a nice boiled egg and a 'ot cup of tea--'</p>
<p>This picture was so far removed from the true and cheerfully
happy Caesar that Meg could listen no longer.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry, Mrs. Rudge. That really isn't true. Caesar is very
happy with us and has <i>plenty</i> to eat. He wants to stay with
us, we want to keep him, but we <i>can't</i> afford to raise his
wages, not just now at least--'</p>
<p>But Mrs. Rudge had her head raised as though she were
listening to a call from above. Her neck that had before scarcely
existed was now a long and skinny one. She beat the air with a
dry and withered hand.</p>
<p>'It's my Pain,' she whispered. 'It's my Pain.'</p>
<p>Meg rose. 'Oh dear, I <i>am</i> so sorry. Where is it? What
can I do for it?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Rudge beat the air quite frantically.</p>
<p>'It's there--in the stummick. And now it's going up. Oh, it's
in <i>my</i> chest fearful!'</p>
<p>But Meg had been there before. She put some money on the
table.</p>
<p>'Shall I fetch someone?'</p>
<p>'Oh no, mum, thank you. It's a bit better. It's going down
again. It's settling in its proper place. I'm very grateful to
you, mum, I'm sure.'</p>
<p>'Well, talk it over with Caesar, will you? I daresay he
<i>could</i> get more somewhere else, but we don't want to lose
him and he doesn't want to go. We're very fond of him, you
know.'</p>
<p>'Yes, mum, I'm sure . . .'</p>
<p>'Good-bye, Mrs. Rudge.'</p>
<p>'Good-bye, mum.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking slowly homewards, Meg Delaney suffered one of her
sharp moments of depression. Mrs. Rudge was <i>real,</i> and in
all probability the world contained a great number of just such
selfish, ruthless tyrants. Mrs. Rudge to Mussolini . . .</p>
<p>At certain intervals Meg had the experience that all optimists
and idealists have. A person encountered, a passage read, a word
caught and remembered, and the World of Light is suddenly
curtained in darkness. It <i>is</i> true, then, this that cynics,
destroyers, disillusionists are for ever repeating: human nature
is grim, snakes and monkeys we are, no progress has been made. We
see ourselves, in those bitter moments, as our detractors see
us--weak, complacent, blinded, ever-trusting optimists. We are
ashamed. We hang our heads. The bitter moment does not endure.
Whether it is our glands, our digestions, or merely the fact that
we were so unhappy as children that we must needs be happy now,
the pendulum swings back--we cannot deny the love of our friends,
the coming of spring, the succulence of a new potato, the rising
of the theatre-curtain, the glass-green heart of the turning
wave, the tread of the springing mountain turf. A bruised and
mangled world, rich with beauty and terror-veined promise. . .
.</p>
<p>All the same, Mrs. Rudge stuck in Meg's nostrils. And her own
sad weaknesses too! For had she not in this very month taken at
least three taxis when omnibuses would have done? And here they
were, Fred and herself, refusing to raise Caesar's wages by ten
shillings a week! But raise Caesar and Mrs. Ganter too must be
raised. Fifty pounds a year more! and the Pullets and the Pakes
threatening to leave! Very shortly another attack on the house
would be made, and the raising of the servants' wages might be
the last little feather added to the already bursting pillow!
Fred would yield. He would sign the house's destruction! And
then, as Meg knew, he would never again forgive himself, his
rectitude would crumble, he would drink and embrace a hundred Van
Renns, Kitty and Bullock would vanish into air. . . . What of the
Joyful Delaneys then?</p>
<p>Seen thus Mrs. Rudge appeared as an old witch riding her
broomstick through the thick night air above Shepherd Market,
screaming destruction to the Delaneys.</p>
<p>'I was weak to give her money,' Meg thought. 'How ridiculous
to give the old wretch ten shillings when I have to hesitate
before buying myself a pair of gloves! It's a kind of blackmail
really. I give her money every time I go there, just to stop her
going on about her Pain. And well she knows it. Why am I so silly
and so weak? There's a lot of real pain in the world. Mrs. Rudge
is a sham and I encourage her in her shamming.'</p>
<p>But in the very middle of her self-condemning she was
compelled to stop, just outside her door, and buy some daffodils
from a little man with a withered leg.</p>
<p>He coughed and thanked her.</p>
<p>'You are sure they're quite fresh,' she said, knowing they
were not.</p>
<p>'They are that, ma'am. Picked this morning.' He looked at her
wistfully.</p>
<p>'There isn't any sort of a job--' he began.</p>
<p>'I'm afraid not.'</p>
<p>'You see, my lady, my wife's got the bronchitis and there's
the rent due--only five shillings--'</p>
<p>She gave him five shillings.</p>
<p>He looked at her quite angrily.</p>
<p>'I 'ates flowers,' he said, most unexpectedly.</p>
<p>'Oh no, you shouldn't--'</p>
<p>''Eartless things. Don't care what you're suffering.
Flowers--and your wife with bronchitis and a kid a month old.
Sure there ain't any kind of job needed? I'm clever with my
'ands--'</p>
<p>Then something in her face charmed him. He smiled. He spoke to
her like a father to his child.</p>
<p>'Never you mind, lady. I'll manage . . .' and went on down the
street flourishing his daffodils.</p>
<p>'I must speak to Caesar,' Meg thought. She must see him at
once, partly because he would improve the nasty taste of his
mother, partly because she could never bear to leave anything
suspended. She must come to the crisis. She must finish the
thing. And often enough she had spoiled what she was after by her
impetuosity.</p>
<p>The room that she loved so much was warm and protected against
the outside March rawness. She looked at the William and Mary
clock. Three-thirty. That man and his little girl, Bullock's new
friends, were coming to tea at four-fifteen.</p>
<p>She took off her hat and gloves and threw them into a chair;
in her furs she stood before the fire, warming herself, and
looking with delighted happiness at the room just as though she
had never seen it before, and especially at the Rowlandson
water-colour she liked best, the one where they were drinking
outside an alehouse and the coach was arriving and a little boy
was flying a kite, the figures with round rosy faces and stout
posteriors, the colours blue and pink and brown--soft, English,
contented.</p>
<p>She had rung the bell and now Caesar appeared, small, anxious,
his large mouth grinning, rubbing his hand on his black
trousers.</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Caesar, come in. I want to talk to you about
something.'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>
<p>He came forward and stood close to her, looking at her, as he
always did, with the greatest admiration. To him she was simply
the finest lady in existence. There was no one worth a gold watch
compared with her. Which was the way he thought because he wanted
a gold watch more than any other thing in the world.</p>
<p>She looked at him and smiled. This lovely friendly room and
Caesar inside it--how happy they made her!</p>
<p>'The fact is, Caesar, I've just been to see your mother.'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.' His eyes withdrew a little, his forehead
wrinkled, his mouth was serious.</p>
<p>'It's this business of raising your wages. It's troubling Mr.
Delaney and myself a good deal. You see, we both want to do it.
We know you're not really getting enough for all you do and that
you could get more elsewhere. We couldn't bear to lose you.
Everything depends on you. The trouble is, if we give you another
ten shillings a week, then Mrs. Ganter will want it too. That
means another fifty pounds a year, and that would bust us. Mr.
Delaney might have to sell the house. I'm not a very good
manager, I'm afraid, but I'm going to try and economize. The fact
is that the rents of the flats in this house are very small, but
if we raise them everyone will go and then we'll be worse off
than ever. That's the way it is.'</p>
<p>Caesar looked up at her with so sweet and bewitching a smile
that it was all she could do not to put her arms round him and
kiss him. There was always something to her especially touching
in his small-boyish stature and his grown-up official garments.
He was like a boy dressed up for a party. He had rather a hoarse
voice.</p>
<p>'What does Mother say?' he asked, watching her with his eyes
very anxiously.</p>
<p>She would have liked to say that his nasty old mother had
denied all knowledge of the affair, but that would have put him
in the uncomfortable position of proving his mother a liar. So
she refrained. And <i>he</i> would have liked to say that every
night now his mother made his life a burden by demanding whether
he'd brought it off, whether he'd got the rise, and if not why
not, and did he know that he was killing her by his cowardice,
and why had she so ungrateful a son who, after all she had done
for him, etc. etc. But that would have been unkind to his mother,
so <i>he</i> refrained.</p>
<p>'Well, ma'am, I hardly know rightly what to say. You've been
so good to me, you and Mr. Delaney and Miss Kitty and Mr.
Stephen, that I'm sure I'm willing enough to work for nothing,
seeing as how I'd rather be working for you and Mr. Delaney and
Miss Kitty and Mr. Stephen than the King <i>and</i> Queen . . .
only . . . only . . . the way it is I sort of feel--' He stopped.
He looked at her dumbly. He didn't feel anything of the kind. He
was perfectly contented here. It was his mother. This nag, nag,
nag, this complaining, these tears--and there <i>was</i>
something else!</p>
<p>He dropped his eyes, then looked up again full into Meg
Delaney's glorious ones.</p>
<p>'You see, ma'am. There <i>is</i> something else. There's a
girl--I--'</p>
<p>'Oh, Caesar!' Meg was enchanted. 'You're in love with
someone?'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am. First time. She's working in one of those flats
back of the Market. She spoke to me one morning. There's a man
spoke to her and she didn't like it. I know him, name of Brocket,
owns a house in White Horse Street. Bad lot <i>he</i> is, and I
told her if she was ever in any sort of trouble she was to come
to me, and so we got talking and now--well, now we're going out
together. I never was in love with anyone before, but now I am
proper. And if Mother hears of it she'll carry on simply awful.
That's what she's always been afraid of, me marrying--and so I
thought if I had a bit more money, that would keep Mother quiet
and so--'</p>
<p>Meg caught Caesar's grubby hand and shook it.</p>
<p>'Now that's splendid. Are you sure she's a nice girl?'</p>
<p>'A <i>nice</i> girl! Oh, ma'am!' His rather wistful Cockney
face seemed to be lit up with a kind of glory. Glory was also
expressed by the tips of his ears and his nose, which were all in
an instant rosy. He spoke breathlessly as though he'd been
running. 'She's from the country, Mrs. Delaney. Only been in
London a month or two. She's beautiful, she is truly. All the men
are after her. She's as fresh-looking as the place she come from.
And innocent! Why, Mrs. Delaney, she don't know a thing and she's
got a voice with an accent in it that's lovely. It <i>is</i>
truly. But she does want looking after and it was lucky for her
she told me about Brocket, because I've got <i>his</i> number all
right, I have. And if he starts bothering her there'll be murder
done in the Market.'</p>
<p>He drew a deep sigh and then said in a sort of holy
whisper:</p>
<p>'Her name's Margaret Dundee.'</p>
<p>'Why!' cried Meg. 'It's the same as mine! But isn't the
surname Scotch?'</p>
<p>Then Caesar looked at her with so fatherly a gaze that she
felt quite young. But his paternal feelings were not for her.</p>
<p>'She's called Dundee,' he said, as though he were confiding a
most tremendous secret, 'because she don't know her parents.
Never did. She was found on a doorstep in the town of Dundee.
Brought up in an orphanage.' His eyes opened yet wider. 'It's my
belief she's of very high blood. You'd think so yourself, Mrs.
Delaney, ma'am, when you see her walking. Like a princess . . .
!'</p>
<p>The glory faded. His brow puckered again like a monkey's.</p>
<p>'I can't tell Mother,' he said huskily. 'I just don't
dare.'</p>
<p>They were now two conspirators.</p>
<p>'You tell your mother,' said Meg, 'that we're going to do
something about the wages. You might tell her, too, that you're
looking round for another job, although you won't be, of course.
Can your Margaret cook?'</p>
<p>'That was just what I was going to tell you,' Caesar said
ecstatically. 'I haven't had more than one of her cakes and some
biscuits, but the people she's working for, they've got rid of
their cook and made Margaret do it, raising her wages, of course,
and she says <i>they</i> say they never knew such a cook. Not
that she's one for praising herself. You have to drag it out of
her.'</p>
<p>'Well, who knows what the future may bring? Anyway, for the
present don't you say a word to anybody, Caesar, and keep it dark
from your mother. Just come and tell me if anything happens.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I will, ma'am. Thank you very much. You're ever so kind.'
Then, backing a little towards the door, he said: 'I'd do
anything for you, Mrs. Delaney.'</p>
<p>'More than for Margaret?'</p>
<p>That confused him. Then he grinned.</p>
<p>'That's different,' he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She went into her bedroom and changed her black dress for a
rich purple that she dearly loved, brushed her black hair, put on
a pair of long ear-rings of purple and silver, then returned to
sit in front of the fire and dream for a moment before her guests
arrived. 'I'm motherly, that's true. And yet I'm not motherly at
all. I want to take everyone under my purple wing and do for
them, and yet I don't want to take any of them under my wing
really. I want to be rid of them, to have no cares, no
responsibilities. I love Fred, Kitty, Bullock. How dearly I love
Fred, every inch of him! I love him so that I must believe in
immortality, some kind of continuing relation with him that
nothing can break. And dear Kitty! How sweet she is and how proud
of her I am! And Bullock, what a dear boy, how good and
gentle-hearted! Yes, <i>how</i> I love them! And yet I want to be
rid of them all! I want no ties. I want to go out into the street
and do just as I please, speak to strange men, find out how
people live, take a boat and go to Bangkok, bury myself in China,
ride for ever through Persia. Nevertheless, if I <i>could</i> do
these things I would be homesick, worried about Fred, hoping
Kitty was safe and Bullock free from colds! How tiresome it is!
And how exciting too! And how foolish! Here am I an ageing woman
happy as a child because I love to be alive! I <i>cannot</i>
learn sense! I <i>cannot</i> be quiet and wise and wear grey
clothes and put away my ear-rings.' . . .</p>
<p>'Captain Coventry and Miss Coventry.'</p>
<p>Meg knew, as soon as she touched his hand, that this man was
dangerous. A bad man, no, for she was wise enough in her own
generation to know that bad men and women do not exist. Only we
are destructive or creative; in greater or lesser degree there is
always that distinction. Creative or destructive of course only,
for certain, at the moment of contact; but that which we are
frequently we become finally. Nicholas Coventry was destructive.
Coarsely handsome now, running to disintegration, his clothes
excellent, his eyes hard, inquisitive, active, gay although often
apprehensive. She knew at once that he would amuse her, but she
was sorry for him, and that she did not want him to be Bullock's
friend. She caught the reflection in the round mirror by the
window of his tall, straight, thickening body, his too-ruddy
cheek, the back of his head (his hair-cut was almost too
excellent), and felt an instant addition to the dangers that were
accumulating against the Delaneys.</p>
<p>He undoubtedly had not expected so opulent, so brilliantly
glowing a lady. He liked opulence and his sensual taste was for
middle-age. He held her hand a trifle longer than he would have
done had she been younger and slighter.</p>
<p>Then the child caught and absorbed Meg's attention. What a
queer creature with that child's body, the beautiful quiet face
(for it was beautiful even though a year ago it might not have
been), the pallor, the dark hair, the rather shabby grey dress,
the quiet watchfulness!</p>
<p>'Won't you sit down? Bullock will be here in a minute.
<i>And</i> tea.'</p>
<p>The child sat down, on the edge of her chair, very
straight-backed, her hands folded. Coventry, entirely at ease,
began to produce his charm. 'He's been charming for years,' she
thought. 'It's become mechanical. He's thinking of something
else.'</p>
<p>She knew immediately that, whereas once he had been able to
control his every thought and movement, he was reaching now a
decadence when subconscious desires and thoughts begin to have
control. Soon his acts also would astonish him by leaping like
animals into the arena before he had given the word. She knew
that he was stripping her in his mind while he talked of Paris
and the open-air play in Verona and robbers at Toledo and a
special kind of pastry to be found only at Avignon.</p>
<p>The child said not a word but with her eyes took in
everything. Indeed, Lizzie Coventry was astonished by Mrs.
Delaney. It was seldom now, poor dear, that she was astonished at
anything, but she had never in all her troubles and adventures
seen a lady like this lady before. She thought that if you were a
woman and middle-aged and English, you were either a good woman
like Aunt Fanny, or a horribly cheap bad one like Mrs. Agar. But
here was an Englishwoman in brilliant colours, flashing rings and
chains like an actress, and yet a fine English lady beyond doubt
or question. And not only fine but of a grand size like one of
the women in history. Kind, too, for at the moment of Bullock's
entrance Mrs. Delaney flashed at Lizzie a smile so generous,
understanding and comforting, that the child--who was cold, weary
and almost at the end of her endurance--had all that she could do
to prevent tears from filling her eyes.</p>
<p>Bullock came in with Endless at his heels. That dachshund took
an instant and fawning liking to Captain Coventry. This was
strange because Coventry kept no dog, had no scent about his
trousers that suggested dogs, food, or sport, and made no canine
effort for politeness' sake. But it seemed that Endless
recognized an old friend, and even when Caesar brought in the
tea, an event that as a rule commanded instantly the whole of
dog, soul and spirit, he never removed his liquid brown eyes from
Coventry's face. As with all dachshunds his intelligence was a
little ironical, a trifle cruel. To surmount the irony of his
ludicrous body he had achieved a humorous criticism of men and
women that made them themselves self-conscious. He greeted
Coventry instantly as a fellow-ironist, which in fact he was.</p>
<p>Bullock's anxiety caused his mother to love him. Because of it
she was more amiable to Coventry than she intended to be, and so
they all soon became very gay. What was Captain Coventry doing?
Was his work in London?</p>
<p>He looked the serious man of affairs.</p>
<p>'You know what it is--a little business in the City, sometimes
not so bad, sometimes damnable. We've been going up and down for
years, haven't we, Liz?'</p>
<p>'Yes, Papa.'</p>
<p>'It seems so difficult now,' Meg said, 'to know where the
money <i>is.</i> You used to be able to say: "There's money. I'll
go for it." Now you don't know--no one knows.'</p>
<p>'That suits me,' Coventry said, laughing. 'I'm an adventurer,
you know. Always have been. As long as there's bread and butter
for myself and my little girl, that's all I worry about. I'm
afraid I'm a rolling stone, Mrs. Delaney, and that's a fact.'</p>
<p>'How I'd love to be a rolling stone!' Meg cried. 'Only even
nowadays when women can go anywhere and do anything it's
difficult. So here I am settled down with a family.'</p>
<p>Coventry gave her a gay buccaneer look as much as to say: 'If
you'd like a little jaunt with me I'm sure I could manage
it.'</p>
<p>Meg felt she disliked him very much. There was a strain of
commonness there which offended her. There was no commonness in
the child, however. Meg took her over to a Chinese cabinet that
stood in the far corner and opened some of the drawers. In them
there were pieces of silk, some fans, a small lacquer tray or
two, odds and ends that Meg had picked up at one time or another.
Lizzie was fascinated. She had a piece of orange silk marked with
little silver figures in her hand and stroked it.</p>
<p>'I love beautiful things.'</p>
<p>'Do you? So do I. In fact my husband is always scolding me for
buying things that I shouldn't. What beautiful things do you like
best?'</p>
<p>Lizzie drew a little breath, gave Meg a serious look as though
to see whether she could be trusted, decided that it was safe,
and went on in a low voice that was almost a whisper:</p>
<p>'In Venice once Papa bought me a little painting. It was very
old and there was the Madonna and the Child sitting under a tree
and St. Joseph watching them. Behind them was such a lovely
landscape, tiny trees and a river and a little town all green and
blue except there was a tower that was pink. It was the most
beautiful thing I ever had.'</p>
<p>'Have you still got it?'</p>
<p>'No. We sold it once to pay a hotel bill.'</p>
<p>'Oh, what a shame!'</p>
<p>Lizzie looked, with an odd contraction of her brows, about
forty.</p>
<p>'Oh, we have to do that sometimes, when we haven't any money,
you know.'</p>
<p>'Do you like London?'</p>
<p>'It's as good as another place.'</p>
<p>'Have you plenty of friends?'</p>
<p>'Oh no--not <i>friends.</i> We lived with my Aunt Fanny for a
time in Westminster. <i>That</i> was nice. She had a boy, Edward,
who goes to Westminster School. We were friends, but I haven't
seen him for a long time.'</p>
<p>'What do you like doing best?'</p>
<p>'I like to go walks by myself and see the people in the
streets. And I like reading.'</p>
<p>'What do you read?'</p>
<p>'French books mostly. I like Proust and André Gide. Paul
Morand's good too sometimes. The English don't write as well as
the French.'</p>
<p>Good heavens! Meg didn't know. She vaguely was aware of the
name of Proust as of a Frenchman who wrote long and difficult
books, mostly about homosexuality. What kind of a child
<i>was</i> this?</p>
<p>'Will you come and see me sometimes?'</p>
<p>'Yes, if you'd like me to.'</p>
<p>'I'd like you to very much. I love walking and riding on
omnibuses and seeing the town.' Then she added: 'Would you like
that piece of orange silk? I'd love to give it to you.'</p>
<p>Lizzie's hand trembled. 'Oh no, I mustn't . . .'</p>
<p>'Yes, you must. There--slip it into your dress. It's
<i>our</i> secret.'</p>
<p>The child looked at her, took the piece of silk and looked at
it.</p>
<p>'I must tell Father,' she said. Then, after a little pause,
added: 'You are very kind, thank you.' She went and showed it to
her father.</p>
<p>'Well, really, Mrs. Delaney. That's too good of you. You'll
spoil my little girl.'</p>
<p>Five minutes later they departed. All that Meg said to Bullock
was:</p>
<p>'I don't trust that man, Bullock.'</p>
<p>'No--nor do I.'</p>
<p>'But the child's a darling.'</p>
<p>'Yes, she is.'</p>
<p>'What are you going to do about her?'</p>
<p>'See that she's safe.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Meg, kissing him on the forehead. 'You're right.
She's worth saving.'</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Fred Delaney stood in the hall of the Charles Street house
hiding an annoyance with his brother Larry which was by no means
new to him. He had experienced it first when, at the age of two
or so, Larry, crawling under the table beside him, had pinched
his leg to draw his attention from dreaming to something
practical. Larry had been doing the same thing ever since. He
stood now, very smart in his deep-blue overcoat, his faintly
yellow gloves, his soft dark-blue hat, advising him about the
house.</p>
<p>'Sell it, old boy! Don't be such a bloody fool. The strain's
simply killing you. You're getting to look like old Ma Plunket
who can't make up her mind whether to sell her shell-backed
chairs to Corleone or not. One day she thinks she will, another
day she won't, and that's after my getting Corleone to lunch in
her house, which is a thing she's longed for all her life, and I
had to work like the devil to bring it about, I can tell you. Old
Plunket's been in her bed for a week with a sort of nervous
breakdown, and you'll be the same if you don't look out.'</p>
<p>Larry's voice, which had all the decisive pressure belonging
to a man who was ever selling things to people who didn't want to
buy, went echoing up the stairs, and the whole house shivered
with disgust.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, but Larry was just the kind of man the
house couldn't endure. It was for the house Fred Delaney was
annoyed; he never minded Larry half so much in the street. But,
as often before, it was Larry's implication that he, Fred, was a
dreaming ass that irritated him so especially. A dreaming ass
when he had kept the house together all these years, when he had
managed all these difficult people with tact and adroitness--a
thing that Larry could never have done, for he had tact with
people only when he was intent on making a bargain.</p>
<p>He had certainly no tact now. He struck Fred on the shoulder
with a horrible brotherly patronizing geniality.</p>
<p>'You're sentimental, that's what you are, old lad. You and Meg
are two of the most sentimental people I know.'</p>
<p>To be sentimental, to have no humour, to believe in God, to
dislike cruel sports, to have trust in whatever Government may be
in at the moment, these are the charges that any decent person in
these days must rightly resent.</p>
<p>'Sentimental, am I?' cried Fred. 'Just because I want to keep
the house we were born in and our fathers lived in before us.
Pity more people haven't sentiment if that's what sentiment is.
Now you get out, Larry, before I kick you out.'</p>
<p>'All right,' said Larry. 'Don't lose your temper, old boy.
What I say is true though. You can't keep the house unless you
raise the rent, and if you raise the rent you won't get the
tenants. There you are--in a nutshell.'</p>
<p>'Why shouldn't people pay higher rents? Look what they are
asking for flats all round here. Twice as much as <i>we're</i>
asking.'</p>
<p>'Exactly. That's just it. Flats, yes. Poky rotten flats, many
of them, but they're modern with modern gadgets. 1934. That's
what <i>they</i> are. People are afraid of old houses these days.
Think they're full of rats and ancient privies. <i>I</i> know. I
go about and hear things.' He caught his brother's arm. 'By the
way, you don't want to sell that old clock of yours? If you're
hard up, I mean. I'm sure I could get a pretty penny for it. I
know just the party. Old Lord Ragadoon. He's mad as a hatter, but
he's got lovely things. I know I could persuade him.'</p>
<p>That was the last insult.</p>
<p>'Go on, Larry, get out. You don't understand me and you never
have. I wouldn't be you for all the gold in America.'</p>
<p>'All right, old boy. I'm going. See you soon.'</p>
<p>And Larry went.</p>
<p>After the door was closed Fred stood there in the dim morning
sunlight, looking up the stairs as though he were asking a
question. In actual fact he didn't know what he was doing except
cursing Larry. He always felt a small boy when Larry had been at
him, and he felt that now.</p>
<p>But in some respects he was one--the kind of twopence-coloured
strain that hinders maturity was in him as it had been in Robert
Louis Stevenson, Scott, Tom Moore, Goldsmith, in almost every
Irishman and Scotsman perhaps. Not that maturity isn't there, but
through it there runs the silver skein of playing at life as
Stevenson played at his toy theatre. This Fred Delaney had, a
strain neither in his wife nor children. For Meg did not
<i>play</i> at life--she embraced it with both arms--and Kitty
and Bullock were, like all their generation, in many ways, mature
before their time. Fred Delaney was the only child in the family
and the only poet.</p>
<p>His visions of Ireland, London, this house, his wife, women,
were all poetical: that is, filled with music, colour, fantasy,
twice as deep as they looked and gone before they were grasped,
but leaving in their wake some lasting tune, some permanent
colour.</p>
<p>But his trouble was that he could not communicate any of this.
He might burst out, as he had done on that New Year's morning to
Munden concerning London, but those outbursts were rare. He had a
true positive belief in things: stone and mortar and brick and
clay and oil and steel and silk and cotton--these materials and
the shapes man made of them--as being sentient, responsive,
depending for their life a little on the human souls with whom
they were. And he reconciled this new machine age in which he was
placed absolutely with the world of truth and beauty. Man would
subdue it and transform it as, so often before, man had subdued
and transformed its ancestors. His beloved London in which now so
many lovely buildings were tumbling down had, he believed, an
inner spirit that would conquer all that it absorbed. But
destruction--real total destruction--that he had not counted
on!</p>
<p>Ever since, on the afternoon of the thunderstorm, he had read
in the evening paper that casual article about raids, fire bombs,
poison gases, a fresh and most poignant anxiety had grown round
his heart. This could not harm his fundamental happiness, but it
made him something of a man-at-arms guarding with his life the
treasure-house of the King. It had increased the poignancy and
tenderness of his love of London. She might, like any and every
human soul, have evil in her--wicked ways and filthy slums and
crooked politics, noise and stench and confusion, but these
things were only because she was alive and composite and real.
And as with London so, in the heart of her, was this house. She
also was threatened with destruction. With something more
imminent and perilous.</p>
<p>As now he looked up at that old staircase, dimly laced with
sunlight, his heart ached with love for her. That might, as Larry
had said, be sentimental, but everyone was sentimental about
something!</p>
<p>He ran up the stairs and, as he had so often done before,
hastened to the very top of the house. Here, up some little
wooden stairs above Patrick Munden's flat, was a grimy little
attic room with one small window looking right over the town. He
flung it open and leaned out. Spring was in the air, the sun
bathed benignantly the roofs and chimneys that lay now in a sea
of glitter from which rocks and monolithic creatures and helmeted
warriors and extended blackened arms uprose to the blue sky.
Higher, higher, in flying ship he might go and from that clear
sky look down on this black glittering sea and discern perhaps in
some pale line on those waters minute bodies moving as germs move
in a doctor's chart. Detach one of those germs, and from its
miniature life proceed the Mozart Violin Concerto, the 'Hailstone
Chorus,' the dark self-portrait of Rembrandt, King Lear's heath,
and the revelations of Einstein. Miraculous miracle! Wonder of
the stars! . . . The murmur of all life came to his ears. He
dropped, he dropped, and there was once again the faint pain in
his left temple, the slight occasional stiffness of his right
leg, the steady friendly beating of his heart. He closed the
window and thought of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu. Why that Queen of
Blue Stockings? For no reason except, of course, that she had
been in that house, and the Mrs. Pasket Delaney of that time
whose journal in a salmon-coloured cotton-cover manuscript book
Delaney possessed (it was dry and dull; otherwise he would have
published it) recorded numbers of times: 'Mrs. Montagu came. . .
. Mrs. Montagu present. . . . Mrs. Montagu held forth to my
thinking far too frequent.' That was after her marriage, when she
moved to the house in Hill Street, where, as Hannah More said,
'She lives in the highest state of magnificence,' which meant
Chinese taste and a whole room painted by the brothers Adam. Mrs.
Delany too--no ancestress; only one E--she was in the house, and
that always brought Swift into it, the Duchess of Portland and
Lord Chesterfield. However, now his back was aching, for the
attic roof forced him to stoop and the sun was hot on his
forehead.</p>
<p>But he was cheerful again now. London, Mrs. Montagu, the
brothers Adam--how insignificant and unimportant Larry was beside
these! Once again, as so often before, the house itself had taken
him and consoled him and whispered that Time was not and Beauty
could not die.</p>
<p>He stepped down the little wooden stairs, humming a tune, and
knocked on Patrick Munden's door. This was the humblest and
cheapest of the flats, and indeed was not a flat at all but just
two rooms, and Munden, being a careless young Communist to whom
all things were in common, never locked his door. Fred knocked
again, then, getting no answer, poked his head in. The room was
in fairly decent order although books were piled on a chair and
one boot, lonely and gaping for company, stood in the middle of
the floor. Fred wandered about, calling 'Patrick! Patrick!' for
who knew but Patrick might yet be asleep after a night's
Communistic celebrations? No answer, and Fred was about to go
when a single sheet of paper stirred, by his movement, from the
table, tumbled to the floor. Delaney, thinking it might be one of
Patrick's poems, stooped, picked it up, realized that it was
Dodie Pullet's handwriting and unavoidably read the first line:
'Patrick, my sweet, I can't manage five o'clock because Smoke . .
.'</p>
<p>He read no more and was ashamed that he had read any. He was
ashamed for himself, for Dodie Pullet, for Smoke, for Munden. . .
. There was, of course, nothing in it at all: girls wrote like
that in these days to the merest acquaintance, but it fitted,
fitted too damnably with his own uneasiness. Munden was the sort
of young intellectual with whom girls like Dodie--nice girls,
clever girls, unsatisfied girls--did fancy for a moment that they
were in love. Munden, like any other young man, let his brains be
what they may, was attracted by physical beauty. Smoke could be
no pleasant, easy companion just now. Figures in the Rain!
Figures in the Rain! Delaney, from the superior vantage of his
added years, felt a great kindness, sympathy, tenderness for all
of them! The stinging, unsatisfied, melancholy loneliness of the
lust of the flesh! Did he not, like every other vigorous man,
only too desperately know it!</p>
<p>But behind the sentimental kindliness there were stern facts.
If Smoke, in his present state, knew of this, to what tragedy
might it not urge him! It seemed to Fred, listening there in that
empty room and staring at that empty boot, that the house, his
friend and companion, was pressing upon him, urging him to take
some step, to move forward and halt some danger. But could he? He
was the friend of all of them and yet he had never before,
perhaps, realized with such vivid acuteness the remoteness of one
human being from another.</p>
<p>He felt as though his love for this house in which they were
all living together should give them some sort of common bond.
And yet it did not. If he went to Munden and said, 'Look here,
old man, because we are living under the same roof don't make
Smoke Pullet unhappy!' he would be committing some interfering
impertinence. To Smoke, of course, he could say nothing. And to
Dodie? A word, perhaps--a very, very careful word. Useless. And
yet the house was on every side of him, urging, pressing upon
him, pleading.</p>
<p>He shook off the fantasy, went out, closing the door softly
behind him. He wasn't much use, he concluded; sentimental, Larry
had said, weak as he well knew, happy with only selfish reasons
for happiness. God help us poor men all!--In spite of the Mozart
Concerto, we're a feeble lot!</p>
<p>Outside the Pake door he paused again. Should he go in and
give them the glory of the morning? He often visited them and he
knew that they liked to see him. Something now prevented him. For
one thing, he did not want, now when he was already distressed
about the Pullets, to hear Millie say to him that she was
afraid--that she was so very much afraid--that they would not be
able to afford . . .</p>
<p>He had a sharp sense that, behind that closed door, drama was
developing. The drama of old age. Twenty years ago those two old
ladies would have seemed infinitely removed from him, he was so
young and lusty, they already fifty or more, their lives, their
<i>real</i> lives, already behind them! But now he was himself
through two-thirds of his life, and already for him past, present
and future were so confusedly mixed that he was one with these
old ladies, at the verge of death, as he was with that infant
realizing for the first time that smother of apple-blossom in his
uncle's garden in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>With Time or without it the old Pake ladies had brought their
own lives, every fragment of their experience, to enrich the
house. They had added their gifts to the decoration of that
edifice of beauty. He remembered one afternoon when, going in
unexpectedly, finding Lady Helen alone except for the little
maid, he had found her lost in the past as though she had been
under a spell.</p>
<p>She had not been bemused or bewildered. She had said to him at
once: 'Sit down there, Fred, and keep me company.' Keep her
company he had and passed with her into a world where it was
always afternoon--the carriage, the horses straining, had risen
to the top of the hill, and there, sunlit in the evening hush,
the whole map of the country, coloured orange and dark umber,
silver-grey and purple, lay in tranquillity beneath them. There
had been no sound until someone had said: 'Time to go back. The
Laceys are coming for dinner.' (The Laceys or whoever.) So down
the hill they had gone, rolled under the old grey arches, blinked
a little in the fire-lit dusk of the stone hall, gone slowly up
the wide staircase to see the clothes laid out on the bed, to
hear the clock ticking and the fire murmuring and the last
twitter of the evening bird beyond the window.</p>
<p>Now there was poverty and pain and a foreign world. But there
was no sadness. Beauty once caught could not be lost. Helen was
brave and would take what came with no whining grumble. So also
he. Experience of life was enough, even at its bitterest, for any
bold adventurer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So down the stairs he went, softly, humming his little tune.
And then once again he paused. For now he was outside the Pullet
door. Should he knock and enter? It was nearing lunch-time and,
more than likely, they would both be out. But Smoke might be
there. He might say to him a cheery word or, on the other hand,
he might stir that unhappiness to some violent suspicion. Should
he venture? Should he leave it alone? Something told him, as
though the house were answering his question, to let it go. He
felt deeply sympathetic with Smoke. Here the feminine strain that
is in all sensitive men made him long to comfort and reassure.
But, at the moment, it was wiser to be silent.</p>
<p>He would find Meg waiting for him in the room below, for the
children were out and they were to have luncheon alone. Meg! Meg!
How she assured and consoled and strengthened! How deeply, how
deeply he loved her!</p>
<p>He ran down the last steps of the old staircase and, as he
opened the door, called out joyfully:</p>
<p>'Meg! Meg! Are you there?'</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c203" id="c203">CHAPTER III</a></h1>
<h2>APRIL IN THE PAINTED ROOM</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Kitty Delaney, on an early day in April, went to luncheon with
Sarah Grafton. It was a very intellectual luncheon in Sarah's
lovely little house in Chelsea. There were present among others
Lady Marble, Mr. Luke Armstrong, the brilliant essayist, Amelia
Gracie, the yet more brilliant novelist, a stout, smiling foreign
gentleman called, Kitty thought, Gramophone, or something very
like it, but everyone addressed him as Voltaire (she didn't, of
course, know the point of this), Mr. Pankhurst the famous critic,
and Garfield the painter.</p>
<p>Kitty was altogether unsuited to this company and was present
only because she liked Sarah Grafton so very much. Last year at a
picture show whither an artistic friend had borne her, she had
seen a little painting of a lady looking at a mirror. She had
cried aloud in the regular Delaney fashion, 'Oh, I do like that!'
and a tall, beautifully dressed woman with grey hair standing
beside her had said: 'I'm glad. I painted it.' They had talked
and in five minutes were friends. Kitty liked Sarah Grafton for
every possible good reason. Sarah was an excellent painter,
influenced by Sickert, Matisse, but not too much. She was a
wealthy American who had lived in London for many years. She
entertained the very clever people but was not herself
supercilious or intolerant of those who, like Kitty, knew nothing
about Art. She was kind and generous and gay, over fifty but
interested in everything. When Kitty went to her luncheons she
didn't mind that she had no artistic gifts or interests because
Sarah did not mind and she liked to listen.</p>
<p>These very clever people always seemed to her peculiar because
they were so kind and so cruel all at the same time. They were
kind with their hearts and cruel with their brains. For instance
just now, while the sole in an extraordinary brown sauce was
proving so lovely, they were admiring a novel which, although
Kitty hadn't read it, she nevertheless knew all about. It was one
of those novels that for all she could see in them seemed to her
to have returned to the elemental style of 'The Cat was on the
Mat. This is the Pen of my Aunt.' She could herself, she thought,
quote sentences from it although she had not read it.</p>
<p>'The wind ruffled the hair of old gentlemen going to their
Clubs. As Myra poured the tea out of the silver tea-pot, asking
the Colonel from India whether he liked one lump or two, Mrs.
Monks grubbing in the dust-bin found a cigarette and a broken
comb. The Queen was passing down Bond Street, and in spite of the
wind the gentlemen took off their hats.'</p>
<p>'I know as much about it as they do,' Kitty thought, feeling
very clever, but Luke Armstrong in his high piping tones was
saying: 'You can only take the subconscious so far. What we want
in the novel is to return to Giotto.' Wasn't Giotto a painter?
But never mind. What Kitty really wondered was why Mr. Armstrong
must be so dirty? She had wondered that often about Patrick
Munden, but after all, Patrick was a young poet with very little
money and Communist beliefs. Not, of course, that all poets and
Communists were dirty--far from it--but Patrick had his excuses.
She couldn't see what excuses Mr. Armstrong had, coming to
luncheon in Sarah's beautiful house, all gold and rose and the
staircase lined with such exquisite drawings. She wondered, as
she decided that she would never taste sole as lovely as this
again, how Mr. Armstrong could succeed in always being
<i>half</i> shaved, for she had met him in Sarah's house before
and that was always his condition. And why he must wear that soft
collar of a dirty grey, and did he ever wash his hands? They all
smiled and were ready to be generous to everyone until someone
mentioned poor Mr. Hacking, who was, it seemed, in the Foreign
Office and couldn't keep a wife. He had apparently had two and
lost both. They fell upon Mr. Hacking, rent him to pieces and
threw bleeding fragments of his body in the air. He was, it
appeared, mean, tactless, vain, ignorant and timeserving. Yet he
was also, she gathered, a friend of all of them. Then Amelia
Gracie mentioned her little boy who had just gone away to school
for the first time, and, in spite of herself, tears filled her
eyes and she told them of his first letter home and his
homesickness and how she couldn't endure to be without him. She
spoke as the very simplest of mothers, brilliant and devastating
novelist though she was, and they all took her as that, giving
her advice and consolation, surrounding her with comfort and
kindliness. Voltaire was almost in tears and said: 'Ze poor
little fellow. Your English public schools they make me very
seeck!' Only Mr. Armstrong became a little restless under this
domesticity and murmured, 'All the same, Braque is beginning to
be as old-fashioned as a Christmas card,' which, although it had
nothing to do with Amelia's child, roused fury in the heart of
Voltaire, who had evidently known Braque well in Paris and had
even sat as a violin for the central motif in one of his most
famous pictures.</p>
<p>At the word Braque Kitty pricked up her ears. That was the
name on the painting in Hanover Square, and at once the world was
illuminated for her, a wonderful harmony seemed to reconcile her
with everyone in the room and, to her own surprise, she heard
herself saying: 'Braque's a beautiful painter. I don't think
he'll ever be old-fashioned.'</p>
<p>Voltaire, who was sitting next to her, and had obviously,
until then, thought her a pretty but uninteresting girl, turned
now a kindly gaze upon her and said confidentially:</p>
<p>'You must come and see my little collection--yes? I have a
Picasso of the blue period. <i>Exquis.</i> Also a Miró and a
Dali.'</p>
<p>This stirred Mr. Garfield, who, in his mildness and look of
rather simple blind inattention, resembled a penguin, to burst
into a frenzy very unlike his innocent face. He flapped his arms
and cried: 'Miró! Dali! . . . Dali, Miró! What are you talking
about? Those impostors! Don't you realize that you must paint
what you see? Didn't Cézanne do it? Everyone from the Spanish
cavemen to Cézanne--'</p>
<p>'Miró paints what he sees,' Luke Armstrong said in a voice
which was like that of a mosquito singing in space.</p>
<p>'Then Miró should be in a madhouse, and Dali--the whole damned
lot.'</p>
<p>'But,' pursued Armstrong in a maddening manner and examining a
finger-nail that was blacker than it ought to be, 'Dali is
expressing <i>what</i> he sees and then more than he sees. What
he sees is a trifle compared with what he doesn't see. . . .'</p>
<p>'Oh, how boring! How boring!' most unexpectedly cried old Lady
Marble. 'You're talking like the people in clever young men's
novels. Why can't you all be real for once? I have a garden, a
lovely garden, and there isn't a rose in it that wouldn't put you
all to shame. Dear Sir Edward Burne-Jones, he was a delightful
man and no one has been able to draw like him since he died. Then
there was Mr. Browning and Robertson of Brighton. You should have
heard him preach. And dear Sir Henry Irving. He enjoyed his
supper more than anyone I've ever known. And a beautiful luncheon
you've given us, Sarah dear.'</p>
<p>This was the signal for the ladies to go upstairs and to
admire, as they always did, the drawings on the staircase.</p>
<p>'Yes, it <i>is</i> a beauty, isn't it? Cotman. And that's a
Turner. Very fine, isn't it? No, dear. I'm afraid Monday I am
<i>not</i> free--almost any other night.'</p>
<p>Safe in the beautiful drawing-room, Kitty had a word or two
with Sarah.</p>
<p>'I think I'm in love, Sarah, at last!'</p>
<p>'Oh no, dear, are you? I <i>am</i> so glad!'</p>
<p>'I'm not sure. I may not be. It may be only that I want to
help him so very much.'</p>
<p>'Help him?'</p>
<p>'Yes, he's a young man in a shop, with a dreadful father. He's
very clever and he's writing a brilliant play.'</p>
<p>'Oh, darling, do be careful!'</p>
<p>Sarah laid her hand on Kitty's.</p>
<p>'I know that kind so well. Nowadays when classes seem to be
vanishing it's so easy to make a mistake. A man isn't better or
finer just because he's in another class. So many women think
so.'</p>
<p>'Sarah--if I'm in a difficulty--if I want help and advice--may
I come to you?'</p>
<p>'Of course, darling, you may.' Sarah's hand tightened on
Kitty's. 'I'm such years older than you, but we're alike in that,
that we both want to help people. Only helping people isn't easy
especially if your own feelings are roused. It's so hard
sometimes not to make them dependent on you, and then perhaps you
suddenly find you've come to the end of it. It isn't your fault
that you have, but it <i>is</i> your fault that you've made them
taste a kind of life that, without you, they'd be lost in. You've
spoilt them for their own and given them no other. I'm preaching
but--<i>moi qui parle,</i> I've been through all of it. . . . Is
he in love with you?'</p>
<p>'Yes, he is--or thinks he is.'</p>
<p>'Is he very young?'</p>
<p>'Yes--very.'</p>
<p>'Well--be careful.'</p>
<p>'Yes. I know. But I rush on. I see something ahead of me so
clearly--'</p>
<p>The men came in. Kitty said good-bye. Sarah looked after her
anxiously as she went out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Braque was not in the window and Kitty felt a pang of
disappointment. It had been there for weeks and weeks. Now the
colour seemed to have died out of the Square, which to-day was
trailing little webs of mist, and overhead there was a sky
sulkily on fire. Kitty entered Zanti's to find Mr. Zimmerman
<i>and</i> Alton Foster. She had been twice to the shop lately
and once Mr. Zimmerman had been there. He was a stout little man,
with a grey moustache and eyes slightly bloodshot. He was
immaculately clean and his high collar creaked as he moved his
neck about. Kitty felt extremely foolish because now he was
seeing her for the second time and most certainly would expect
her to buy something. Alton had given her one glance and then
buried himself behind the little desk in the back of the shop.
Kitty was very unhappy. She realized the truth of all that Sarah
had said to her, and yet the sight of Alton, a slave to the
stout, bloodshot Mr. Zimmerman, made her only the more
determined. Never mind whether Alton loved her or she Alton--he
must be rescued from this. Her heart was beating quickly. She
felt with every meeting with Alton a nearer approach of some
possibly fatal climax. What she really wanted was to put her arms
around him, comfort him and tell him that a millionaire would
produce his play Tuesday fortnight. Meanwhile Mr. Zimmerman was
showing her things. He was opening drawers and bringing out
trays.</p>
<p>'I can see that you care for beautiful things. There is no
necessity to buy. Mr. Zanti who founded this business, he always
said: "Show things! Show things! Let the sun shine on them and
the air blow on them! Don't keep them buried." I have not his
eye--his taste, his sensibility. No one will ever have again. He
was a magician. But see, madame. Here are some beautiful
things--is it not so? This is, of course, Chinese. The head-dress
of a bride. Silver gilt filigree openwork, with applied ornament
in the form of a temple, dragons and ho-hos. Yes, that is a
kingfisher feather. It is decorated, as you see, with pearls.
This is very handsome. A sixteenth-century cameo portrait cut in
a dark onyx--look at the enamelled setting, madame. We know that
as the "Peapod" style. The enamel, as you see, is green with
little white "peas" and has small diamonds set on each pod. And
here is a beautiful thing--a brooch--ovate mounted in gold, the
central ornament, you will notice, is carried out in fine gold
mixed with tiny pearls, mounted on a ground of purple foil, the
whole surrounded with a ring of brilliants. Eighteenth-century.
And this--this is the most beautiful thing we have. Cellini,
madame. Oh, undoubtedly. A museum piece. See how perfectly the
gold-work is modelled. A mixture of <i>repoussé</i> and chasing.
See how the stone was chosen for its beauty of colour, never mind
the form, and then cut <i>en cabochon</i>--the diamond is backed
with black, and the beauty of the stone depends very largely on
the shade of the black. Ah! he was an artist, Cellini was--and
what happiness and joy a true artist can give to the world so
many hundreds of years after he himself is gone!'</p>
<p>Kitty saw that Mr. Zimmerman was quite transformed while he
was handling his treasures. A kind of beauty shone from his
little fat stiffly-clothed body. The whole shop had a kind of
glow, the same glow and colour that the Braque had given to the
Square. And this beauty too involved the bent, humble form of
Alton Foster. She looked for an instant across the shop to him
and she seemed to see a genius there, a greater genius than
Tchekov or Shaw. It had been given to her, it was her mission to
rescue him from the Dragon!</p>
<p>Mr. Zimmerman was saying: 'If you will afford me, madame, one
moment. I hear the telephone ringing from the other room. It is a
message I am expecting. Forgive me. The young man will attend to
you.'</p>
<p>The stout little body scurried across the floor and
disappeared. The young man came quickly over to her. He looked at
her beseechingly.</p>
<p>'We have only a moment. Tell me. You are not angry with
me?'</p>
<p>'Angry--of course not.'</p>
<p>The light of his genius still suffusing him, she thought he
was adorable.</p>
<p>'But I haven't seen you--I haven't heard from you--I'm going
mad.'</p>
<p>She was happily maternal.</p>
<p>'Now, Alton, you mustn't be like this. We are friends. Nothing
can change it.'</p>
<p>'No. Nothing can change it,' he repeated, staring into her
eyes.</p>
<p>'Then you mustn't worry. You mustn't be upset. I'm going to do
something to get you out of this. Have you written any more of
the play?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Another five scenes.'</p>
<p>'Good heavens! It must be getting frightfully long.'</p>
<p>'No--one scene is only one line. It is the most important
scene in the play.</p>
<p>'You must let me see it. How is your father?'</p>
<p>'Just the same.'</p>
<p>'Yes, he always will be. I'm sure of that.'</p>
<p>He began to be greatly agitated.</p>
<p>'The worst of it is, you are making me see everything
differently. Neither my father nor sister is the same to me as
they were. And they realize it. But I don't care. If you'll only
let me see you sometimes, nothing else matters. You are inspiring
me. My old life, before I met you, is dead.'</p>
<p>Kitty felt a chill reminder of Sarah Grafton's warning.
Nevertheless, now she had begun she must go on.</p>
<p>'Please--tell me--how soon will I see you?' he said.</p>
<p>'I'll write. Very soon. Very soon--I must go. Now, Alton,
don't be unhappy. We are friends always--remember.'</p>
<p>She gave him her hand, and then before he realized it she was
gone, just as Mr. Zimmerman came hurrying back into the room.</p>
<p>In the Square again she was appalled by her weighty sense of
responsibility. It should not be as Sarah had said. Was she in
love with this man? She did not know, but she felt an imperative,
protective necessity to do anything, everything for him. And
suddenly she knew. She would go now, at once, this very minute
and see his father. She would tell Mr. Foster that Alton had
genius, was wasted where he was, must be given help, freedom. . .
.</p>
<p>Almost before she knew she was doing it she had summoned a
taxi.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She looked at once towards the painted walls. It was
impossible not to do so, for now they seemed more intimate to
her, a little closer, and their tender soft colours more
appealing. She felt this time an impulse of almost furious
irritation at the vulgar daubs that here and there concealed
them. There was one place in especial where a horseman in silver
armour riding along a path under dim peach-blossom vanished into
a violet crimson sunset with blue waves like rolls of cloth
tumbling on to papier-mâché rocks. . . .</p>
<p>Miss Foster had admitted her and was talking. Mr. Foster had
been painting when she entered and had laid his canvas down on
the floor. He looked as spruce as ever and there was a flower in
his buttonhole. She knew that they were surprised and excited to
see her. What had she come for? What was her game?</p>
<p>'Tea--tea,' said Mr. Foster. 'Lucy--crumpets. Miss Delaney
must test our crumpets!'</p>
<p>'Oh no!' she cried out almost in horror. The thought of
another vast tea was simply appalling to her. 'On no account.
Last time--you remember?--I said I never had tea.' She laughed,
and Lucy Foster choked when Kitty had expected her to giggle. She
choked as though she would die. Mr. Foster paid no attention
whatever, but regarding Kitty with the utmost blandness said:</p>
<p>'You wouldn't insult our hospitality, Miss Delaney. I am sure
you are far too kind and generous for that. Only--you have taken
us by surprise. Had we had warning--But, as it is, the little
baker's shop down the road--only a door or two. Lucy won't be a
moment. Not a moment.'</p>
<p>Kitty noticed that when he mentioned crumpets there was a
certain unctuousness and realized that her visit had given him an
opportunity for food that he could not without her have had. He
was determined on his tea. Lucy should go for the crumpets. She
did, hurrying away with little chatting noises and wearing a hat
like a small coal-scuttle.</p>
<p>They were alone and Kitty did not care about it. It was not
that she was frightened, for what could an invalid do? Even
though he were but partially paralysed she could deal with him,
and Lucy, in any case, would be but a few moments. She was
wondering whither her Delaney impetuosity was leading her. She
had no right to busy herself about Alton. He himself was so
<i>naïf</i> thatin all probability both his father and his sister
knew that he was in love with her. They must, of course, suppose
that <i>she</i> had some interest in <i>him.</i> It was, however,
the gaze that Mr. Foster now fixed on her that made her
uncomfortable. It was kindly, beneficent, and quite frankly aware
of her pleasant appearance. She was wearing her luncheon-party
frock, her colour was high, her head erect. She knew that he was
admiring her. But he was also ironical, even, could it be a
little patronizing? Oh! what a foolish thing she had done, in
coming thus impetuously! And how truly paralysed was he? Could
he, for instance, raise to its full extent one of his strong
stout arms? The fact that his face and neck and thick brown hands
alone were visible, and that these seemed to pulsate with superb
health, made the rest of him dangerous! A double danger in its
invisibility. Her chair was decidedly close to his couch. She got
up, examined the paintings on the walls, then, turning to him
with a charming smile, said:</p>
<p>'I came on an impulse, Mr. Foster. I wanted to speak to you
about your son.'</p>
<p>'Yes. Of course.'</p>
<p>His whole body, under the rug, made a movement. She wondered
whether she ought to offer to assist him. But of course not. That
would be most dangerous. There was an implication of helplessness
in his effort which touched her. However slight the paralysis, it
must be terrible for so strongly built and otherwise healthy a
man to lie there, day after day, at the mercy of that imbecile,
his daughter. Why should she fear him? She had never been afraid
of anyone her life long. She came and sat down in the chair
again.</p>
<p>'I think Alton has great talent. I have read part of the play
that he's writing and I think he's being wasted where he is.'
Before he could speak she went on. 'I'm afraid I must seem
dreadfully interfering to you, Mr. Foster. I'm afraid, too, that
I've made Alton restless by being interested. That means that I
feel responsible a little. I want to help.'</p>
<p>His reply was utterly surprising. He leaned his whole body
over, moving it, as it seemed to her, in one rigid piece, and his
hand, touching the floor, raised the canvas. Moving his hand very
stiffly he turned the picture towards her. He said:</p>
<p>'What do you think of this?'</p>
<p>She was honest and fearless, so she said:</p>
<p>'I don't like it.'</p>
<p>'You think I'm a bad painter?'</p>
<p>'I know nothing about painting. I'm quite inartistic. You
mustn't pay any attention to <i>my</i> opinion.' He was staring
at her and breathing heavily.</p>
<p>'You're the first person--the first from the outside world,
Miss Delaney. I can move my hands very little. I cannot sit up
properly. It's a miracle I can paint at all. God's miracle. What
do you say to that?'</p>
<p>'If it makes you happy--'</p>
<p>'It doesn't make me happy. I know this seems bad to you
because you're used to old-fashioned painting. You like that
milk-and-sugary stuff on the walls. You do, don't you?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I do.'</p>
<p>'I thought so.' He sank right back flat on his back, his mouth
scornfully grinning. 'It doesn't matter what you say--what anyone
says. . . .' Then his voice changed. It was soft and friendly.
'So there we are, Miss Delaney. You think I'm no painter and I
know I have genius. You think Alton has genius and I know the
boy's a damned fool.'</p>
<p>'He isn't a fool,' she broke in hotly.</p>
<p>'Oh yes, he is. Do you think his own father doesn't know? He's
a weak, silly, sentimental fool and I don't want a beautiful
woman like you to waste your time over him.' His body moved
again. 'Listen, Miss Delaney. I'll tell you something. I'm
getting better. There's improvement every day. I'm getting
stronger. Soon I'll be on my feet. Soon my arms will be strong
and then I'll show them the painter I am!' He grinned all over
his face like an excited schoolboy.</p>
<p>'Don't you think I speak well for my station in life? Do you
know what my father was? A farmhand down in Glebeshire. There
were ten of us and we lived in a pigsty. But I was the handsome
one <i>and</i> the clever one and there was a lady in the
village, a charming lady, <i>she</i> taught me--'</p>
<p>'How long is it since--?'</p>
<p>'My accident? Twenty cursed years. I'm forty-five. My white
hair makes me look older, doesn't it?--and I've got stout lying
here. My dear wife, under God's governance, died five years
ago.'</p>
<p>Kitty said, 'It must have been terribly hard for you.'</p>
<p>He grinned again like a naughty boy.</p>
<p>'God's been looking after me. God gave me the accident so that
I should have a chance to show what a strong man can do. Do you
believe that God looks after each one of us?'</p>
<p>'I don't know.' She had no idea as to whether he was sincere
about God or was scornfully mocking. She could not tell at all.
Also, being of her generation, she was sceptical about God.</p>
<p>'A bit roundabout way of doing it, though, don't you think? I
was the strongest lad in Glebeshire. When they heard I was
bathing all the girls would come closer to have a peep. Bit
vulgar, aren't I? I'm everything, Miss Delaney--vulgar and
refined, religious and pagan, clever and stupid, artist and
Philistine, weak and strong. . . . But you want to be talking
about Alton, not me. Are you in love with Alton?'</p>
<p>She looked him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>'I don't know. What do you mean by being in love, Mr.
Foster?'</p>
<p>'Why, wanting to sleep with someone, of course. There, I'm
vulgar. One thing with one person, another with another. And
that's why I've changed with you, Miss Delaney. It's a compliment
really. I was all manners the other day, wasn't I? But as soon as
I saw you were a real person I had to be real too. It's because
you're real that it's silly of you to fall in love with Alton. Go
to bed with <i>him</i> and you'd find he wasn't real at all. Now
if <i>I'd</i> been fit and strong--'</p>
<p>Kitty got up. He said:</p>
<p>'Now don't you be shocked.'</p>
<p>'I'm not going,' she said, 'because I'm shocked, but because I
see we can never agree about Alton. You don't understand him in
the least.'</p>
<p>Mr. Foster laughed joyfully and she saw his whole big body
quiver under the rug. Then to her own surprise, and even horror,
Kitty found that she was laughing too. It was one of the troubles
of the Delaneys that they found themselves laughing at the very
moment when they least wished to. Meg and Bullock were especially
victims of this unfortunate habit.</p>
<p>'Don't understand my own son--that's a good one! I understand
both my son and daughter, and how it came to be <i>my</i> seed
created them I'm at a loss to understand. I am indeed. Lucy's a
fool and Alton's a weakling.'</p>
<p>'He's only a weakling because he's given up his life to keep
<i>you</i> in comfort.'</p>
<p>'Don't I know it? Would anyone but a weakling stay at home
looking after a crippled father? Sloppy sentimentality--and the
more that he hates the sight of me!'</p>
<p>'And what would you have done if he <i>had</i> gone away?'
Kitty cried.</p>
<p>'Oh, I'd have cursed him and told the world what an ungrateful
child I had. But I'd have managed and admired him the more. Here
now--sit down again. Stay a while yet. It does me good to look at
you.'</p>
<p>Kitty sat down.</p>
<p>'Your daughter's a long time with the crumpets.'</p>
<p>'She'll be back soon.'</p>
<p>'I believe you told her to stay away.'</p>
<p>'I did say to her that when you came again she was to see and
stay away so that we could have a talk together.'</p>
<p>'<i>When</i> I came again! How did you know that I would?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I knew you would--to see me just as much as to see
Alton.'</p>
<p>He smiled a really charming smile.</p>
<p>'Draw your chair closer. You needn't be frightened of me. I
haven't the strength of a child. There! You're putting the chair
on the painting! Not that it matters! Take my hand for a moment!
Do you feel how strong it is! Now put your hand on my arm! Weak
as a baby's. I'm in your power entirely, dear Miss Delaney.'</p>
<p>The flesh of his hand was firm and strong, but there was no
resistance in the bones of it. She touched his arm, then she took
her gloves, her furs from the table and moved to the door.</p>
<p>'Now I'm really going.'</p>
<p>'And when will you come again?'</p>
<p>'I'll come again if you'll promise to do something about
Alton.'</p>
<p>'Do? What do you expect me to do?'</p>
<p>'Let him have his chance with his play.'</p>
<p>'Of course he can have his chance with his play. What's to
stop him?'</p>
<p>'Not while he has to work in that shop.'</p>
<p>'Do you want him to give up a safe job, then?'</p>
<p>'I'll find something.'</p>
<p>'You can do what you like if you'll only come and see me
again. I'll paint something like the pictures on the wall. Just
to please you.'</p>
<p>He looked at her, as she stood by the door, every inch of her,
from head to foot. Then, with that same strange resolute urging
of his whole body, he turned himself and lay with his face away
from her.</p>
<p>She thought for a moment that she would pick up his painting
for him. Then, deciding against it, she went without another
word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meg was out. Bullock was out. Fred Delaney was fast asleep in
front of the fire. She bent over and kissed him, once, twice,
thrice. At the third kiss he awoke. He grinned.</p>
<p>She stood in front of the fire, for the April afternoon was
cold.</p>
<p>'What were you dreaming? You were giving little moans.'</p>
<p>'Yes--of pleasure, darling. For I was flying through the air,
an angel in each arm. At least I think they were angels. And I
kissed first one, then the other, slowly, melodiously. They were
wearing only the thinnest of draperies. What have you been doing?
. . . Oh, Lord, see how late it is! I must go and dress.'</p>
<p>She took a round fat-cushioned stool and sat at her father's
feet. She leant her head against his thigh. He rested his hand
against her cheek. They were blissfully happy. He bent forward
and kissed her cheek.</p>
<p>'Darling . . . I've told you I must go.'</p>
<p>'No. Wait a minute. It isn't six yet. Yes. I think I'll tell
you.'</p>
<p>'Tell me what?'</p>
<p>'I've been engaged in an adventure for several weeks--even
months.'</p>
<p>'I know you have.'</p>
<p>'It's very simple. I went into an art-shop in Hanover Square.
There was a young man behind the counter. I liked him somehow. I
paid a call on his family. He has a sister, a father, no mother.
The father is very peculiar.'</p>
<p>'How, peculiar?'</p>
<p>'He's a big stout man of forty-five, with white hair and a
buttonhole. He is paralysed--or partly--and paints dreadfully bad
pictures. The young man has talent and is writing a very clever
play.'</p>
<p>Fred spoke lightly, but he strengthened his hold round his
daughter's neck.</p>
<p>'It all sounds most unreal.'</p>
<p>'It is--and it isn't.'</p>
<p>'Are you in love with the young man?'</p>
<p>'No--I don't know. But it's an adventure. I want to help
him--in fact I <i>must</i> help him. His father says he's no
good.'</p>
<p>'Then he probably isn't.'</p>
<p>Kitty went on, looking into the fire.</p>
<p>'You know I've never known anything about pictures. Well, this
adventure is surrounded by beautiful things. First there was a
picture in a shop in Hanover Square, then in the shop where Alton
works his master showed me the loveliest jewels, then in the room
where they live, these people, the walls are painted all over--by
two young men who had the place once. That's why this adventure
is new to me. I seem to be moving into a new world.'</p>
<p>Delaney watched her with loving tenderness, and anyone seeing
him now for the first time would have thought him a good wise
man.</p>
<p>'Darling, I've been moving into new worlds once a week all my
life. At least I always <i>think</i> they're new. But no--same
old game, same old faces, same old result.'</p>
<p>Kitty caught his hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>'I think this <i>is</i> perhaps new for me. I don't think I'm
in love exactly, but I want to help as I've never wanted to help
anyone before. But it seems so difficult to help without doing
harm.'</p>
<p>'You're right. It is.'</p>
<p>She twisted round and looked in his face.</p>
<p>'My generation--because we have no rules, because we can go
anywhere and do anything--it's hard for us to know where we're
going. Now you and mother and Alton's father and Sarah Grafton
and Millie Pake--you all seem quite definite. You may do the
wrong thing, but you see where you are. We have nothing to guide
us. . . . I don't know. I wouldn't <i>be</i> your generation for
anything, but sometimes--your advice isn't so bad.'</p>
<p>Fred Delaney shook his head.</p>
<p>'I'm no good at advising. I'm always getting into a mess. But
I love my wife, my children, this house, London, beautiful women.
I try not to hurt other people--' Then he caught her close to
him.</p>
<p>'But don't <i>you</i> get into a mess, darling. I'm so fond of
you. So's Meg. We're all of us so happy together. Don't lose your
heart to someone who isn't worth it. Be proud. Not
<i>conceited</i> but proud. I've had no education. I'm as
ignorant as I can be, but I believe in other people being
swells--fine characters, I mean. They tell you in these days that
nothing matters, it's a sort of wolfish world. But it isn't.
Cervantes and Raleigh and Sidney and Sam Johnson didn't think so.
I can see what fine conduct is, even if I miss it myself--'</p>
<p>She kissed him on the eyes gently. Then she got up.</p>
<p>'I don't think you need worry. Only it's <i>interesting.</i>
People are <i>interesting.</i> I've shut myself up, watching,
never sharing in anyone's life, except ours at home. Does it
matter, do you think, if one <i>is</i> damaged a bit? I'm not a
lily in a vase, you know.'</p>
<p>He looked at her for a long time. She returned his gaze.</p>
<p>'You mustn't ask me that. I love you too much. I don't think
you <i>can</i> be damaged. I've often wondered when the time
would come for something to happen to you. Of course, you've got
to take risks. Only--looking back--I'd give a lot now not to have
done some of the shabby things I have done. You'll never be
shabby, Kate Delaney--never.'</p>
<p>They went together to the door, his arm around her neck.</p>
<p>'I've got to have the bath first,' he said. 'I'm in a greater
hurry than you are.'</p>
<p>'Where are you going, sweetheart?'</p>
<p>He hummed a little tune. Then burst out laughing.</p>
<p>'Wouldn't you like to know?'</p>
<p>Then as he turned into his tiny dressing-room, taking off his
coat as he went, he threw back over his shoulder:</p>
<p>'Yes--shabby. That's what I am!'</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c204" id="c204">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>
<h2>CLOSING IN</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And what had been happening to Claude Willoughby during these
last weeks?</p>
<p>To the episodes of the bath salts and the library book one
more had been added--Colonel Badget's gold-topped walking-stick.
<i>This</i> no one had accused Claude of stealing. Brocket,
standing in the doorway, had simply said:</p>
<p>'Colonel Badget has lost his walking-stick. Funny what goes on
in this house.'</p>
<p>He had cast a sombre eye on Claude, who had snapped:</p>
<p>'Yes, it is. Why don't you look after things better,
Brocket?'</p>
<p>This spirit on his part surprised Brocket, who answered:</p>
<p>'There's more in this than meets the eye, Mr. Willoughby.'</p>
<p>'Badget probably left it somewhere.'</p>
<p>'He says not.'</p>
<p>Then Claude took a resolution. He went downstairs and called
on Badget. He did this to clear the air. Everything now was so
mysterious in this house. It seemed to Claude, who was sleeping
very badly and not eating enough, that there was always someone
hiding round the corner. He would wake up in the middle of the
night and feel certain that there was someone in the room. He did
not switch on the light, because he would lie there in order to
hear that someone moving. And it seemed to him that he
did--someone moving very carefully so as not to knock into the
chair or the table.</p>
<p>Claude lay there in the dark, the sweat gathering on his
forehead and his heart thumping. At last he turned on the light
and there was nobody there. There was never anybody there.</p>
<p>He fancied that everyone in the house now regarded him as a
thief. He almost overheard, it seemed to him, the conversations
of Badget, Best and Pierson. He fancied that, on his daily
morning encounters with Pierson, there was a hinting, a
suggestion, a curious suspicious glance from those bottled eyes
under the toupee. It did not seem to him impossible that one fine
morning he would wake to find a police-officer standing inside
his room. For a gentleman of high family and absolute rectitude
these imaginings were torture.</p>
<p>So one morning he went, on a sudden impulse, down to visit
Badget. Badget was the king of this castle. He was the man with
the money, the only tenant to whom Brocket paid deference. Claude
had the fear of him that anyone who is penniless and helpless has
of anyone who needs not to consider money. It is a peculiar fear
that shames the possessor of it.</p>
<p>Claude knocked on Badget's door and heard the shrill, rather
whistling voice from within cry:</p>
<p>'Come in! Come in!'</p>
<p>He went in and found Badget, his long thin legs stretched out
in front of him, comfortable in his armchair, reading the
newspaper.</p>
<p>Colonel Badget was long and thin, with the high bony face of a
complacent giraffe. He was not at all a bad man. He was even a
good one, for he supported a ne'er-do-well brother-in-law, the
unhappy wife of the same, their children, his own fearfully
ancient mother, in the most noble fashion with never a murmur. He
did no one in the world any harm. He was, in his own way,
religious and extremely proud of his country. So he may be called
a good man. He was, however, encased and enveloped by an
overwhelming unquestioning self-satisfaction. He not only thought
himself a good man, but a man quite perfect in every way. It
would not be true to say that he despised other people. He did
not. Scorn implies some sort of comparison. He was religious
because it was agreeable for God to have such a man as himself to
believe in Him. Here his really kindly nature was involved. He
was patriotic, because, having been born English, it was natural
for him to believe in the country that had given him birth. He
had never married because, unlike Sir Willoughby Patterne, he
needed no admirers. He was himself sufficient for that pleasure.
And in any case sexual emotion was outside his dignity because it
implied a certain levelling.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to call him arrogant. With his staring,
slightly surprised eyes, protruding chin, long neck that
contained a fine Adam's-apple, shrill tones of voice, immaculate
but inhuman clothing, he was incapable of patronage because that
involved a considered relationship.</p>
<p>You might have thought that he would be lonely, but he was not
so, because, having for consideration and constant observance an
absolutely perfect person, the minutest happenings to that person
were of importance and interest. Physical ailments were for him a
constant preoccupation. It was, for example, a piece of high and
curious impertinence for the common or garden cold to make itself
felt in so immaculate a nose or throat. He felt a humorous,
almost friendly indulgence towards such a cold, rather as
Napoleon would have considered an urchin who took his
handkerchief. Further intrusion than this upon his person,
however, was, on the part of an ailment, indecency. He had of
late been conscious of certain rheumatic pains in the right
groin. At first he addressed the rheumatism with such disdain as
to be practically inaudible. The rheumatism remained. His disdain
changed to anger. Still the rheumatism lingered. He paid a visit
to his doctor, Sir Hector Firebrace, who was almost as arrogant
as himself. Together they addressed the rheumatism in such terms
that it should have shrunk trembling away. Instead of that it
awoke him in the middle of the night and bit his left elbow.</p>
<p>He was quite aghast with astonishment--the same surprise with
which he contemplated, from a vast distance, the London County
Council, shop assistants, crooners on the radio, Communists, and
indeed all foreigners, including the Scotch, the Irish and the
Welsh.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized again, however, that he was not an
unfriendly man any more than Alexander the Great was unfriendly.
He greeted Claude Willoughby now with a kindly welcome. He did
not get up from his chair, but he did lay his newspaper on his
bony knees. He had seen Claude before on several occasions but
had never enjoyed a real conversation with him. Not that he ever
enjoyed a real conversation with anybody, because he considered
his words precious and was sparing in his use of them.</p>
<p>To Claude the room seemed very rich indeed but rather
over-burdened with large heavily carved pieces of furniture.
There was a vast sideboard, a massive table, a towering
chimney-piece, and great beetling bookcases filled with heavy
gilt volumes that all looked like Burke's <i>Peerage.</i></p>
<p>Badget, when he was reading, wore spectacles (he considered
his eyesight distinctly impertinent in its more recent
behaviour). These spectacles now slid to the end of his long
nose, waiting deferentially until they should be in demand
again.</p>
<p>'Ah, Willoughby, come in. How are you?' And then, as he
extended his long, cold, bony hand, 'What can I do for you?'</p>
<p>Claude hesitated. He felt oddly like the small boy he had once
been at Harrow when, summoned by his housemaster, his small hands
pressed with nervous anticipation his thighs. He had acted on
impulse in coming. He had not realized that the room (which was
papered with a stiff, dark, bronze-coloured wallpaper), the
furniture and, of course, Badget himself, would appear so
altogether overwhelming. However, he had come about the
walking-stick, so he would begin about that.</p>
<p>'I was very sorry to hear from Brocket yesterday about your
walking-stick.'</p>
<p>'My walking-stick?'</p>
<p>'Yes--that it had been stolen.'</p>
<p>'Ah, certainly--I had forgotten.'</p>
<p>(This had the double effect of making it appear that Badget
had dozens of gold-headed walking-sticks, and that Claude was a
fool to have come on such a business.)</p>
<p>Claude thought--have I the courage to sit down? Certainly he
should ask me to do so, but of that there seems no sign. Have I
the courage? Yes, I have. He sat down on one of those dining-room
chairs that are so ugly and uncomfortable that only excellent
food and drink can help one to forget them.</p>
<p>'Well,' he said with nervous cheerfulness, 'I'm delighted--I
mean it's agreeable that it's a loss of no importance. I
understood from Brocket that it was rather an important
stick--'</p>
<p>'Not at all. Not at all.'</p>
<p>'Of course, we can't tell for certain that it was stolen, can
we?'</p>
<p>'Stolen? Stolen?'</p>
<p>'Yes--I understood from Brocket that you thought it had been
stolen.'</p>
<p>'Who said that?'</p>
<p>'Brocket.'</p>
<p>'He did, did he?'</p>
<p>'Yes, he did.'</p>
<p>'Damned impertinence.' Badget sat up in his chair, felt his
shoulder tweak, and gave a little cry, rather like that of a
chicken just emerged from the egg.</p>
<p>'Brocket said that?' He pushed his spectacles back on to his
eyes and stared as though he were seeing Claude for the first
time and were wondering why, in heaven's name, he was sitting on
that chair without having been first asked to do so. However,
Claude stood, or rather sat, his ground.</p>
<p>'Yes, he did. Distinctly. "Colonel Badget thinks his
walking-stick's been stolen." That's what he said.'</p>
<p>'Damned cheek! Mentioning it.'</p>
<p>'That's why I came in to see you,' Claude said. 'It isn't the
only thing that's been lost in this house. There's been quite an
epidemic.'</p>
<p>'Epidemic!' Badget cried, startled.</p>
<p>'What I mean is a number of things have been missed--Pierson's
bath salts, some library books, and now your walking-stick.'</p>
<p>Badget began to feel a sort of disgusted annoyance creeping up
his spine. What was this miserable-looking, shrivelled-up
nonentity doing in his room at all, and further than that, how
did the miserable little nonentity have the cheek to sit on
<i>his</i> chairs and talk about <i>his</i> walking-stick?</p>
<p>Further than that again, how dared the miserable little
nonentity have the insufferable impertinence to compare Pierson's
bath salts with <i>his</i> walking-stick?</p>
<p>All this made his neck rise and his Adam's-apple agitate. On
the other hand he was a kind man and realized that Claude was a
poor little pitiful, a sort of beggar at the gates--so he bent
his long neck over the side of the chair, blinked behind his
glasses and said benignantly, 'It's nothing--kind of you,
Willoughby, to enquire.'</p>
<p>He might have been referring to his rheumatism, of which, at
the moment, he was actually thinking, but Claude burst out:</p>
<p>'The point is, Badget, we must discover the thief. The point
is that until the thief is discovered, everyone in this house is
under suspicion. Now where did you see your walking-stick
last?'</p>
<p>This direct attack was very disconcerting to Badget, who was
not accustomed to this kind of Scotland Yard question, so, quite
feebly and mildly, he answered:</p>
<p>'I don't know. I may have given it away.'</p>
<p>'Given it away!' Claude was staggered by Badget's reply.</p>
<p>'Little things, you know.' Badget waved his hand. 'Little
personal things. One gives them without thinking. I knew a man
once who made a list, and after his death, his small odds and
ends, trifles, his friends had them, cherished them--'</p>
<p>'But,' said Claude, 'if you gave a walking-stick away wouldn't
you remember it?'</p>
<p>'Might not,' said Badget.</p>
<p>Claude fancied then that Badget was looking at him with a
stare of cold suspicion. He couldn't tell, of course, that Badget
was at the moment not thinking of him at all but was holding a
little earnest, one-sided conversation with his rheumatism, as
thus:</p>
<p>'How dare you bite my shoulder? . . . If you don't go soon I
shall have to take serious steps. . . . Do you <i>realize</i>
what you're doing and where you are?'</p>
<p>But Claude, seeing that haughty, cold stare behind the
spectacles, and the thin, arrogant lips and the pointed,
hat-hanging chin, thought to himself: 'He is sure that <i>I</i>
took his walking-stick just as Pierson is sure that I took his
bath salts. This is awful. They are closing in on me--' His
agitation drove him to his feet. He began, stammering:</p>
<p>'It's all very well. You may take it calmly yourself, Badget.
But it's very unpleasant for me. Very unpleasant
indeed--unpleasant for all of us. It must be cleared up.'</p>
<p>'<i>What</i> must be cleared up?' Badget, leaving reluctantly
his rheumatism, enquired.</p>
<p>But before the question could be answered there was a knock on
his door, the door was opened, and rosy-faced little Mr. Best
stood there.</p>
<p>Mr. Best was short, square-shouldered, stumpy-legged,
rubicund, with bright-blue excited eyes, and he wore gay colours;
a Club tie and sometimes a canary-coloured waistcoat. He was
cheerful, insensitive, ceaselessly talkative, one of the supreme
bores of London Clubland. He belonged to four Clubs and was in
one or other of them all day and half the night. Members melted
before his approach like the snow before the sun. He always gave
them warning, because he began to speak, at a distant sight of a
member, in a loud, echoing voice. He was happy, insensitive,
good-natured, always in excellent health. He liked to tell a
bawdy story and so Pierson simply detested him. He came often to
visit Badget because Badget never ran away. This, Best thought,
was because Badget was interested. It was, in reality, because
Badget was thinking of himself and heard scarcely a word that
Best said.</p>
<p>He began the moment he was in the room.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Badget, old boy! How's yourself? Top of the morning to
you. Slept like a top, I did, and wasn't in till three. Jolly
evening at the Club with Bicester and one or two more. You know
Bicester? Chap shot all that game in Africa. Masses of buffalo,
herds of rhinoceros--' Then he saw Claude and was buoyantly
surprised to find him in Badget's room. 'Hullo, Willoughby! How's
yourself? Hope I'm not interrupting. Tell me if I'm in the
way.'</p>
<p>Badget nodded his head, which Best could take for acceptance
or dismissal just as he pleased. Best took it happily for an
invitation, strode to the window, whistling, looked out with his
hands in his pockets, then turned and regarded Claude Willoughby.
Poor old devil! What a thin scrap of a miserable old boy it was,
with his anxious expression, his wisps of grey hair, his worn and
faded suit!</p>
<p>Claude felt that he must explain his presence.</p>
<p>'Good morning, Best,' he said with dignity. 'The fact is I
came in to see Badget because of the things that have been stolen
here lately.'</p>
<p>'Stolen!' Best cried. 'Stolen! By God, you don't mean it?
What's been stolen?'</p>
<p>'Well,' said Claude, hesitating before Best's energy as he
always did, 'we don't actually know that they've been stolen.
That's perhaps going too far. Anyway they're missing. Some bath
salts of Pierson's, your library books, and now Badget's
walking-stick.'</p>
<p>'I say, Badget, your walking-stick been stolen? I'm most
awfully sorry. Rotten luck. Rotten luck. Hope it wasn't valuable.
I had a walking-stick once, ivory, you know, and all that,
thought no end of it, given me by an old uncle of mine, had it in
the family for hundreds of years. I valued that stick, I can tell
you, and one day--'</p>
<p>'I don't know,' said Badget, with a wrinkling of his nose, a
favourite gesture of his, expressing a kind of bored remoteness,
'that it has been stolen. May have given it to somebody.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that's all right then. I thought Willoughby said--'</p>
<p>Claude felt that both men were regarding him with dislike. He
began to stammer.</p>
<p>'I only said . . . I thought that as Pierson's bath
salts--'</p>
<p>'But, by God,' Best broke in, 'it may be right--there
<i>may</i> be a thief in the house. I shouldn't wonder. Now I
come to think of it, there's a tin of Bath Olivers I was looking
for the other night, couldn't find it anywhere. I rang for
Brocket and said, "Brocket, there was a tin of Bath Olivers," and
Brocket looked a bit green about the gills. I remember thinking
so at the time, now you remind me, and Brocket--'</p>
<p>'Brocket,' Badget interrupted judiciously, 'is quite above
suspicion. It's to his own interests to see that nothing in the
place goes wrong. I can't say that Brocket is ideal in every
respect, but he's honest. I have always found him so.'</p>
<p>'Oh, quite, quite,' said Best. 'But if it isn't Brocket,
who--?' He broke off and stared with his bright blue eyes at
Willoughby. 'Whom do <i>you</i> suspect, Willoughby?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I shouldn't like to say that I suspect anybody,' Claude
said hurriedly. 'I only thought that it's unpleasant, these
things happening, and that perhaps we ought to do something about
it. But if Badget thinks that he gave away his
walking-stick--'</p>
<p>Badget slowly rose, his long legs following his long body in a
kind of dignified procession.</p>
<p>'Ever had rheumatism, Best?' he asked.</p>
<p>'No. Can't say that I have. Wonderfully fit for my age.
Fifty-eight last birthday, and see me stripped you wouldn't think
a thing wrong with me. As a matter of fact there isn't. Not a
thing. I put it down to my morning exercises and two rounds of
golf every Saturday. Morning exercises in front of an open
window, stripped to the buff. You try it, Badget.'</p>
<p>A faint look of disgust spread over Badget's features.</p>
<p>'Well,' said Claude, 'I'm glad everything's all right. I
really am. Yes--well--thank you very much. I must be going.' And
out of the door he slipped without a word from anybody.</p>
<p>Safe in his room again he thought: <i>What</i> a fool you've
been! What did you think you were gaining by going down to Badget
like that? Didn't you know Badget well enough anyway to realize
that you'd get nothing at all by making any sort of appeal to
him? . . . and then that fool Best. . . . Claude stood there and
his thin cheeks slowly flushed. How they'd <i>looked!</i> And
Best, when he had talked about his ridiculous Bath Oliver
biscuits, hadn't he suddenly turned to Claude and fixed his
unpleasant blue eyes on to him? Oh, they suspected something! No
doubt of it. And soon Pierson with his ridiculous toupee and
bombast would join them and they would put their three silly
heads together. Afterwards Brocket would be called in and of
course <i>he'd</i> have nothing good to say about Claude. They
would perhaps search his room while he was out. They had perhaps
already done so. And they would be spying on his every movement.
Oh, he must go, he must go! He must pack up and leave at once!
But whither? And he could not go until he had paid this present
quarter's rent which Brocket had most surprisingly allowed him to
suspend. He had even, it seemed, been glad to do so. Was it,
Claude thought, because now he, Brocket, would have a hold over
him? He hadn't thought of that. He was held, a prisoner, unless
he could pay that rent, a prisoner in this house where everyone
thought him a thief.</p>
<p>Distracted, he began to walk up and down his small room with
nervous, agitated steps. What was he to do? Oh, <i>what</i> was
he to do? He thought of Millie and Helen and those kind jolly
people the Delaneys, but his natural pride and dignity prevented
him from applying to anyone for money. It <i>hadn't</i> prevented
him from saying to Brocket, when that stout unpleasantness had
remarked, 'Well, Mr. Willoughby, I don't mind for this once.
Leave it over to next month, if it's easier for you.' 'Thanks
very much indeed'--a horrible memory, and the more horrible now
when he realized the true reason of Brocket's complacency. But he
couldn't speak to the Delaneys about it, not that lovely young
girl with whom he had shaken hands, nor that kind young boy who
had taken him to the party.</p>
<p>He went yet once again and looked at his beloved things in
their cupboard. No, he would <i>not</i> sell them--not the gold
snuff-boxes nor the silver christening mug, nor the miniature of
his mother, nor the gold brooch with pearls, nor the Marie
Antoinette cup and saucer.</p>
<p>There were other less important things there too, but
they--although precious to himself--were quite valueless to
anyone else. Then, like a flash, thinking of these things and
having also Best and Badget in his mind, there illuminated his
brain and being something that Badget had said to him about a
friend of his who had left all his odds and ends to be selected
by his friends after his death. Now, thinking about it, Claude
did not find it foolish at all. He would leave these precious
possessions one by one to his individual friends. He hadn't very
many--Millie and Helen Pake, the nice Delaney boy--oh yes, and
old Hare down in Winchester whom he hadn't seen for years but
cherished the memory of, and Cluttock who went flower-hunting in
the Andes, and--</p>
<p>He began to grow greatly excited, waving his hands about,
talking to himself. Oh, really, what a <i>beautiful</i> idea! He
had something to live for, or rather to die for. And these things
that he loved so. They would not, after he was gone, be neglected
or despised--years later someone would be saying: 'Yes, that's
the very cup and saucer Marie Antoinette drank her coffee out of.
An old friend of my father's, Claude Willoughby--'</p>
<p>He heard a sound, looked up, and saw Brocket standing
there.</p>
<p>He placed on the table one of those unappetizing envelopes
that consist of a window of celluloid apparently surrounded by a
wall of dirty whitewash. Why does the clothing of a bill always
have the appearance of a pawnshop furtiveness?</p>
<p>'Post,' Brocket said laconically, then, turning to the
door:</p>
<p>'Have a nice talk with Colonel Badget?'</p>
<p>'That'll do, Brocket, thank you.'</p>
<p>'All right then. I'm <i>not</i> interfering.' Then his body
stiffened. 'Only you look here, Mr. Willoughby. It's <i>my</i>
house and I'm not going to have one of my tenants sneaking round
complaining to the other tenants and hinting that if someone's
been taking things in this house it's someone's proper place to
find out 'oo's done it.'</p>
<p>The dirty apron above the unwieldy stomach quivered with
agitation. 'It may be my place or it may not--but when a
gentleman's behind with the rent it's not for <i>him</i> to
complain--'</p>
<p>He had advanced again into the middle of the room and now was
staring at the little collection of things in the cupboard. The
glass door was open.</p>
<p>'Pretty lot of things you've got there, Mr. Willoughby, I must
say.' He began to scratch one of his arms. 'Old, some of them, I
shouldn't wonder.' He moved forward.</p>
<p>Claude stepped in between Brocket and the cupboard.</p>
<p>'You'd better leave those things alone, Brocket,' he said. 'If
you touch one of them with your dirty hands I'll--I'll murder
you.'</p>
<p>The two bodies were almost touching, the one so fragile that a
twist from Brocket's grey arm would surely snap it, the other
stout, heavy with the imponderability of a feather bolster.
Claude caught very strongly the aroma of Brocket's breath--beer,
bad tobacco, ill-conditioned stomach.</p>
<p>The room tilted and rocked. For an absurdly conscious moment
he thought that he would faint and nothing could be more
humiliating than to subside into the arms of Brocket! The blood
of the Willoughbys came to his rescue. He closed, with trembling
hand, the cupboard. He moved away and took a deep breath of
fresher air.</p>
<p>'While I'm tenant here,' he said, 'this is my room and I'll
trouble you not to come in here another time without knocking.
You shall have the rent in a day or two, and after that'--he drew
a deep breath--'you can find another lodger.'</p>
<p>Brocket had been really, for a moment, frightened. He was not,
as life went, a very courageous man, and there had been something
about old Willoughby's face, something. 'Why, you'd have
thought,' he said afterwards downstairs, 'he'd have stuck a knife
into me if he'd had one, the old bastard.'</p>
<p>But now he had recovered and, arms akimbo, he said:</p>
<p>'Easy enough to find another tenant, Mr. Willoughby. But I
don't know as I want to. And somehow--I'm thinking--I don't know
as how I'd be leaving too quick--not until this funny stealing
business has been cleared up.'</p>
<p>He was gone, but the room seemed still to contain his
presence. How hard is it in this world of so many dimensions to
be rid of a haunting presence--for we live in imagination quite
as truly as in physical fact. The murdered are not quiet in their
graves, for as you close down the soil on one, like a worm, the
twister is coiling above-sod there by the graveyard wall! Claude
had never murdered anyone, but the very thoughts that he had had
about Brocket gave that fellow a worm-like quality.</p>
<p>And there was a stench in the room. Claude went out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quite late in that same day he was in Charles Street. He had
heard the echo of Big Ben strike across the Park ten o'clock. He
had come out because of a crazy mad notion that he would pay a
call on the Delaneys. Now, at this hour! But just as he was
beginning to fear the Shepherd Market house, beginning to feel
that it was closing in on him and threatening him with some
horrible disaster, a disaster now linked in his mind with the
cold atheistic prophecies of that man at the party, so the house
in Charles Street was standing to him as a symbol more and more
of warmth, friendship and understanding. An old man's fears are
grim, because he is half a ghost already. He sniffs the windy
spaces of the immortal world into which he is stepping.</p>
<p>Now he looked at the Charles Street door and did not dare to
push the bell. He walked about. There was a thin early April air
blowing and not a soul in the street. All the doors were dead,
the steps cold. The street was as chill as though with the blasé
indifference of brick-and-mortar history it was callous about all
the blood and bones that had passed its way. Little cries of
laughter, a jest or two, a love spasm, a prayer for help, the
clink of a coin . . .</p>
<p>Claude passed, hesitated, passed again, a thin old man in a
cold bare street.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c205" id="c205">CHAPTER V</a></h1>
<h2>TOWER IDYLL</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>'Let's all go to the Tower!' Meg cried. So very deceitful did
she feel that she wondered that they could not all see her
blackened and corrupted heart. She said 'The Tower!' because only
the day before, looking at a Picasso drawing in Tooth's window in
Bond Street, Graham Pender had said to her: 'You'll laugh at me,
but Wednesday afternoon I'm going to visit the Tower all by
myself. Haven't been there since I was a kid. I've been meaning
to go for years.' Then, looking at the Picasso, which was of an
enormous bearded Hercules carrying a struggling pink-bosomed lady
in his arms; 'Funny that should give one pleasure. It's very ugly
really.'</p>
<p>Temptation is for ever coming our way. It isn't as though we
asked for it. Meg had had not the slightest intention of finding
her path to the Tower on that Wednesday afternoon. The Tower!
What a place! Most certainly not. And then on the Tuesday evening
Fred Delaney had cried out to them all: 'We're free to-morrow
afternoon. I know we are. Anyway we've got to be. It's time for a
Family Expedition. Where to is the question.'</p>
<p>All self-respecting families in these days do all they can to
stay apart. And perfectly right. Because you have sprung from the
same loins and sinews is no reason for liking. Two dusty old
people who have paid your school bills and hindered your
enjoyments have obviously no real claim on you. The Delaneys,
however, loved one another and, better than anything else,
enjoyed being alone together. This was difficult to achieve in
these modern restless days. Someone was for ever breaking in!</p>
<p>So, at certain times, they almost guiltily arranged together
that they would creep off somewhere and have an afternoon to
themselves. When they were in the country it was easy enough, but
in Town not so. They had generally found that museums and
collections of things saved them from their friends. They knew
the London Museum, the Victoria and Albert, the Wallace, the
gallery at Dulwich, the Science Museum very intimately. They had
even been up to the top of the Monument together and stayed there
for quite an hour or so. They always pretended on these
excursions that they were visiting London for the first time, and
were very friendly and inquisitive with the guides and
attendants, whom Fred always surprised at the end with the
largeness of his tip. They always dressed on such occasions very
quietly and told one another how greatly astonished the Vicar
would be at all they had to tell him. They always bought a lot of
postcards.</p>
<p>On this Tuesday evening they had been discussing this, that
and the other. Kitty was reading a new novel called
<i>Matador</i> and was wondering aloud whether horses had the
same sense of fun when they were torn apart by the bull as foxes
were confidently supposed to have when torn apart by the hounds.
Fred had been looking at a picture of Miss Paget's Golden Miller
winning the National, and Bullock had been reading about
Mussolini's scorn of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>When Fred suggested a family expedition they all at once
agreed. Behind their current topics had been lurking their
especial personal problems, and, as always when the hard world
was driving from without upon them too severely, their impulse
was to move inwards towards one another. One afternoon alone and
they would go forward with renewed confidence.</p>
<p>That was why Meg Delaney had an awful sense of treachery when
she cried out, 'The Tower!' She knew, better than any of them,
what these family expeditions really meant, and for the first
time in her married life she was planning to betray them. And
yet--what nonsense! In all probability Graham would not be there;
in further probability they would not see him if he <i>were</i>
there! The Tower was a very large place and there were many, many
suits of armour. And if she did see Graham, what of it? She felt
no real treachery to Fred in her heart. She loved Fred more than
twenty Grahams. It was only--it was only--Graham was different
from anyone else with his shyness, his romantic sensibility, his
modesty, his vast knowledge. He had once been in love with her.
He was in love with her still. Was there any harm in that? The
point about being in love was that you should <i>not</i> hurt
anyone else. It would not hurt Fred if Meg were to tell him this
very night: 'Graham Pender, who has white hair and has been
married for years, to whom I was once engaged, is in love with
me. You don't mind my seeing him sometimes, do you?' Fred,
laughing, would certainly reply: 'See him! See him! As often as
ever you like!'</p>
<p>It was all this everlasting search for something. Everyone for
ever searching! Here was Meg, middle-aged, deeply in love with
her husband, perhaps the happiest woman in England. . . . Yes,
and what then? Only the glamour, the colour, the light that never
was on sea or land. Fred did not possess it for her--how could he
when he was now part of herself? Moments in life provided it--the
distant swirl of music, first crocuses on a garden lawn, the sea
on a fine afternoon just before dusk. Oh, a thousand things in
life and nature, but there shifting, intangible. It stayed with
you only in a piece of work or a human being. And there too it
stayed only so long as you did not realize it. The piece of work
ends and the light dies, the beloved is secured and the spell is
over! She knew that well enough. Married to Graham it would never
do. Fred, dear, dear Fred was the permanent joy of her life. But
Graham--just now, for this moving vanishing summer--had the
glamour!</p>
<p>And yet there <i>was</i> something wrong, something traitorous
at the heart of it. No one cared any longer for stuffy laws or
conventions. Yet doing away with them had not really made any
human relations easier! How odd that was! There was, as Fred
always said, a world <i>below</i> the world, a world whose laws
did <i>not</i> change; human beings, by their habits, fashions,
half-discoveries, conceits, patronages, fears, try as they might,
could not affect it.</p>
<p>Meg looked at them--Fred, Kitty, Bullock--sitting around,
close together, and loved them with an almost tigerish love.
Nothing must imperil them, nothing must hurt them--they must be
happy for ever and ever! She got up and went round kissing each
one of them solemnly on the forehead.</p>
<p>'What's up?' Bullock asked. 'Feeling sentimental?'</p>
<p>'I suppose I am. I'm a woman of sentiment.' She looked Fred
straight in the eyes. 'No. Don't let's go to the Tower. It's a
stupid place. I don't know <i>what</i> made me suggest it.'</p>
<p>'On the contrary,' Fred said. 'An excellent suggestion. I
haven't been there since I was six, when I hid behind a Beefeater
and made my governess cry with anxiety. The very place. We shan't
see a soul we know there.'</p>
<p>'Oh, but we may!' Meg said wildly. 'You never know. Everyone
may suddenly decide to go to the Tower.'</p>
<p>'What nonsense!' Fred cried. 'Look here, Meg--I'll make you a
bet. I'll give you five pounds for a new hat if we see a single
soul there we know.'</p>
<p>'<i>You</i> know or <i>I</i> know?' asked Meg, who adored a
bet.</p>
<p>'Whom we <i>both</i> know. And who do you know anyway I don't
know?'</p>
<p>'Lots of people.'</p>
<p>'Well, you oughtn't to.' He stretched his legs and yawned.
'Boys and girls, I am going to bed. To-morrow you're all for the
Tower.'</p>
<p>The three of them sat cosily in front of the fire after Fred
was gone. Kitty was reading her novel, Meg staring in front of
her smiling at the fire. She was thinking to herself: 'I shall
soon be old and I don't mind that in the least, but let's have
all the harmless fun we can.' And then a thought struck her like
a coal leaping out of the fire and burning her cheek. 'What about
Lady Pender? Does she like you, do you think? . . . No, she
doesn't. There's no doubt. She doesn't like me at all.'</p>
<p>Bullock, his tongue protruding between his teeth, was writing
in a little notebook. He wrote, then looked up and beamed at the
fire.</p>
<p>'Is it good, darling?' she asked. 'As good as Mr.
Wodehouse?'</p>
<p>But he wouldn't tell her. He grinned at her with love and
confidence, but he kept his secret. For he was, for the first
time in his life, planning a novel. This Lizzie Coventry had done
to him. She had said: 'Why don't you write a novel? I'm sure you
could?'</p>
<p>'Why do you think I could?' he had asked her.</p>
<p>She had given him a comprehensive answer.</p>
<p>'Because you are interested in people. Because you see things
in a funny way. Because you can tell stories.' She had explained
her views on the English novel. 'English writers don't know how
to be serious and funny at the same time. That's why I like
French writers better.'</p>
<p>There was perhaps no one in the whole world <i>less</i> French
than Bullock, but he read Lizzie a description of two ladies
lunching at the Ritz and she had laughed. She laughed very
seldom, but when she did she was suddenly so care-free and happy
that his heart ached. He had presented to him then, out of the
air, the subject for a novel, a serious, almost tragic subject.
He was quite overwhelmed as he contemplated it, but all the
tenderness and brotherly care he felt for Lizzie Coventry was at
the heart <i>of</i> it.</p>
<p>'Only you will have to take much trouble not to be
sentimental,' Lizzie had said. 'The English are so very
sentimental.'</p>
<p>'I suppose they are,' Bullock said. 'But our novels now are
very brutal. Everyone in them is very savage to everyone
else.'</p>
<p>'That's another kind of sentimentality,' Lizzie had said.</p>
<p>He loved her, but he ought not to tell her that for another
two years at least, so he thought that he would sublimate this
emotion by putting it into a novel and he would disguise his
emotion with his sense of humour. Characters were already
crowding in upon him. He felt all the exuberant happiness and
confidence of the creator before he has begun his creation.</p>
<p>Meg, staring into the dying fire, said, 'If I were granted a
wish now I know what I'd have--a long and painless old age. I'd
like to live on and on, seeing what is going to happen--'</p>
<p>'You'd be lonely without us,' Kitty said.</p>
<p>'Oh, you'd all have to live on too.'</p>
<p>'And all have painless old ages?'</p>
<p>'Of course.'</p>
<p>'Then that would be at least six wishes. And suppose we had no
money, as would be more than likely?'</p>
<p>'We'd <i>have</i> to have money.'</p>
<p>'And suppose there was a World War, an awful one as it would
be?'</p>
<p>'That would be all right if we knew <i>we</i> were going to
have painless old ages!'</p>
<p>'Mother--how selfish!' Bullock said, closing his little
book.</p>
<p>Meg sighed. 'Yes, I suppose it is.' She jumped up. 'I'll have
six wishes! One--no more war. Two--the Delaney family <i>all</i>
to have long painless old ages. Three--the Delaney family all to
be rich. Four--everyone in the world to have enough to live on.
Five--a cottage in the country. Six--universal tolerance and
understanding. There! I think I've accounted for everything!'</p>
<p>Kitty laughed. 'How dull it would be!'</p>
<p>'What <i>do you</i> want, then?' Meg asked.</p>
<p>'I want--I want--I don't know. Love. Discomfort. Unexpected
rewards. Understanding. More understanding.' She stood up and put
her arm round her mother's broad waist. 'I want to grow, and I
expect one does that best in difficulty. Am I priggish?'</p>
<p>Meg kissed her.</p>
<p>'No, dear. I don't think so. It's so hard to say what one is.
At this moment I'm happy and wicked and greedy. I'm off to bed
with your father.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They went down to the Tower in the family car, which they
placed under the watery eye of a little purple-faced man with a
game leg and a stiff arm, in company with other family cars.</p>
<p>All the cars rested there together under the brow of the Tower
and seemed not very comfortable about it. The combined grey-piled
authority of Tower, sky and river was too strong for them. In
fact, under the beetling frown of unperturbed history they ceased
to exist.</p>
<p>The Delaney family, dressed, they hoped, as though they were
just up for the day from the country, moved towards the entrance.
The effect of that mass of frowning menace upon them was
strengthened by the fact that excavations were going on in the
moat. On the other side of the parapet there were numbers of
young men with cameras, little boys, a brooding Alsatian, and men
digging in slimy mud. Curious how sinister this appeared to the
Delaneys! At any moment skulls might be discovered!</p>
<p>At the entrance a Beefeater, a little the worse for wear,
showed them that they must purchase tickets on the other side of
the road. The entrance to the ticket-office was filled with a
stout lady and two fat little girls. One little girl was sobbing
bitterly. It seemed that she did not wish to go to the Tower.
Quite suddenly she broke into a tempest of rage and beat upon the
stout lady with her fists, screaming: 'I hate you, Miss Franks! I
hate you, Miss Franks!'</p>
<p>Miss Franks was imperturbable.</p>
<p>'I want tickets for everything,' she said to the
ticket-vendor.</p>
<p>'The Armouries?'</p>
<p>'The Armouries.'</p>
<p>'The Regalia?'</p>
<p>'The Regalia.'</p>
<p>Only then, with the grey and red slips in her hand, she turned
to the screaming child and said: 'Hilda, remember the snails and
oysters.'</p>
<p>The Delaneys were fascinated by this mysterious reply. The
incident had this importance, that for many a day thereafter any
rebellion on the part of a Delaney would be checked by the
threat: 'Remember the snails and oysters!'</p>
<p>'Do you want to see everything?' the pale, anxious-eyed lady
behind the counter asked.</p>
<p>'Everything!' Fred Delaney said firmly. 'You see, we're up on
an excursion--only three-and-six return, but bringing the
children <i>is</i> expensive and we don't know when we'll be up
again, so we do want to see everything, including the Little
Princes <i>and</i> the Block. . . .'</p>
<p>But, through the entrance and walking towards the Traitors'
Gate, all his gaiety left him, for standing to the left with
Byward Tower behind her was the beautiful Miss Alice Van Renn. He
concluded that his Irish blood was mastering him. She was a
lovely spook; he had but time to realize that she was wearing a
cherry-coloured dress and that a jewel of some sort sparkled in
her little hat, before she was gone.</p>
<p>Many people were hurrying about; the sun for the first time
pierced the grey and threw a faint primrose glow over walls and
towers. He stared. He shrugged his shoulders. He caught his
daughter by the arm.</p>
<p>'Kitty, don't leave me. I'm frightened.' He grinned at her.
'It may be that once we are inside this place we shall never get
out again.'</p>
<p>'It will be all right if we are together.'</p>
<p>'<i>You're</i> all right, aren't you? You don't see
anything?'</p>
<p>'See anything?' Kitty stared about her.</p>
<p>'Yes. Not Lady Jane Grey nor Anne Boleyn nor Henry the Eighth
nor Colonel Blood.'</p>
<p>She had forgotten him. She was staring at the Traitors'
Gate.</p>
<p>He stared also. 'We ought not to have come,' he thought.
'Everything I have done this year is leading inevitably to some
catastrophe. And this is the centre of the world--the evil,
spell-binding centre. This place stinks of death, torture and the
savagery of man. This is the den of the London monster and I am
betraying my innocent family. . . . Good God, <i>was</i> that
Alice Van Renn? Is she beginning to obsess me so that I see her
everywhere? Has it become so evil with me that I can only rid
myself of this wretched obsession by sleeping with her?'</p>
<p>But there they were, all four of them together, his arm
through Kitty's, and he was happy for the most ridiculous
reasons, that the primrose sun was shining, that Bullock's round
face was so charming, and that his own heart, not yet impeded by
any foretaste of destruction, was beating with such strong
regularity in his breast. <i>Had</i> that been Alice Van Renn?
But Meg was talking to the kindly Beefeater.</p>
<p>'And <i>this</i> is the Traitors' Gate?'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am. Here passed on their way to prison or execution
Edward Duke of Buckingham, Sir Thomas More, Queen Anne Boleyn,
Thomas Cromwell, the Earl of Essex, Queen Katherine Howard, Jane
Seymour . . .'</p>
<p>He was reeling off his piece like a child at school, his round
chubby face and white walrus moustache giving him so innocent an
expression that Meg interrupted: 'That's enough. I hate to think
of it. And were you a soldier once? What made you become a
Beefeater?'</p>
<p>'Well, you see, ma'am, it's a permanent job, and being a
bachelor--'</p>
<p>'What! Do you mean to say you're not married?'</p>
<p>He clicked his uncertain teeth together with great
satisfaction. 'No, and I reckon I'm safe now, being sixty-seven
next birthday.'</p>
<p>'Don't you approve of marriage, then?' she asked, greatly
interested.</p>
<p>'No man in his senses would ever marry, ma'am, but he isn't
<i>in</i> his senses half the time, and it's just those
unfortunate lapses--'</p>
<p>She was interrupted by Fred, who wanted to move forward, but
she hated to leave the dear old man, with whom she would
willingly have talked all the afternoon.</p>
<p>'So extraordinary,' she said, putting her arm through
Bullock's as they moved forward. 'He talked like a Professor.
He's <i>so</i> right. I can't think what men ever marry for.'</p>
<p>'I can,' said Bullock. 'If you love someone . . .'</p>
<p>He sighed and she pressed his arm close to her side. She was
aware with a moment of acute surprising jealousy that in a little
<i>he</i> would be married and Kitty would be married and she
would be old. . . . Life moved so swiftly that, with the flick of
action, just as the sun now moved behind a cloud, all would be
over. This Tower would remain. Long, long after she, so alive, so
vigorous, was forgotten, these walls would stand and another
Beefeater would be repeating, 'Here passed on their way to prison
or execution . . .'</p>
<p>But now they were looking at the line of the old Roman wall,
and now climbing steps into the White Tower, and here is the Axe,
the Execution Block, the horrible little waxen figure upon the
rack, the thumbscrew. . . . Here too were children, mothers,
fathers, loving couples, raucous young men, Miss Franks and her
charges, two old ladies with large umbrellas, a bearded guide
with a group that clung to him like ducklings to their mother,
and a long thin Beefeater looking at them all with so grave a
distaste that Meg's heart ached for him. Over all was a pale
shadowed light and the air was chill. The Execution Block! The
Delaneys were fascinated by it. Deep in its greasy shining oak
were grooves wherein the axe had dug. It seemed, as they stared
at it, to move. It had an unctuous satisfaction as though it said
to them: 'I at least have performed efficiently my duty in a
world where everything is always mismanaged.'</p>
<p>'You know,' Fred said, turning from the model of the rack to
the block and back again, 'at the very first threat I would have
confessed anything, given <i>anyone</i> away. Yes, all and every
one of you. At the first stretch I would have condemned you all
to the flames. That's the kind of man I am.'</p>
<p>Meg nodded. 'We wouldn't have blamed you. We would have
understood, I'm sure.' Then she saw that the fat child who had
turned crying on Miss Franks was close beside her and staring at
the Block with wide-eyed, white-faced terror. Its lips were
moving.</p>
<p>She touched the child's arm. 'Don't trouble, dear,' she said.
'They don't do things like that any more and never will again.'
(Don't they? Won't they? Are we any better?)</p>
<p>'They cut off your hair first,' the child said, staring up at
her. 'And sometimes the axe missed the first time. It was like
that with the Duke of Monmouth. He asked the executioner to take
care to do it the first time. But he missed. He did it four
times. I know because I've read it.'</p>
<p>She broke off. She was still staring into Meg's handsome
kindly eyes. Meg saw that she was trembling. Meg kissed her.</p>
<p>'No one's ever going to do that to you, darling. Nor to
anyone. We're so much kinder . . .'</p>
<p>Miss Franks had hurried up.</p>
<p>'Well, I'm sure. Hilda, what did I tell you? I beg your
pardon. She's been told a thousand times not to talk to
strangers.'</p>
<p>'Take her up and show her the armour,' Meg said cheerfully. 'I
can see she's an imaginative child.' She stopped, for there,
starting up the staircase to the next floor, was Graham
Pender.</p>
<p>Then he <i>had</i> come, and he was alone. Her heart began
frantically to beat and she was reminded most absurdly of a day
long ago when, as a child of fourteen or so, she had been lost in
Monte Carlo and had wandered through some gardens with a
yellow-faced, shining-haired young man who had said he loved her
and would feed her with fried snails in a little place he knew.
Snails! Snails and oysters! But now they were climbing the little
staircase and, most unexpectedly, were gazing at a gigantic model
of the Battle of Waterloo. A guide with spectacles and black
bushy eyebrows became one of their family in a second of time.
Eagerly he said to Kitty: 'You look through this glass, Miss.
There! Now don't it come out clear? Yes, sir--move along this
way. That's Wellington--next to him riding on the silver
horse!'</p>
<p>'Well, this <i>will</i> be something to tell the Vicar,' Fred
said. 'He's so especially interested in Napoleon--our Vicar at
Little Frampton,' he explained to the guide. 'We've come up on an
excursion and the last thing the Vicar said at tea yesterday
was--"I don't suppose there'll be anything about Napoleon in the
Tower. I hardly see how there can be." Little he knew! Look,
Hilda,' he cried to Kitty, 'at all the soldiers--thousands of
them. Why, Waterloo must have covered the whole of Belgium
practically.'</p>
<p>So Meg had slipped away on the other side of the gigantic
model and found Graham in an alcove studying some helmets. They
were miraculously hidden from view.</p>
<p>'Well, Graham,' she said.</p>
<p>He was vastly astonished.</p>
<p>'Meg! You--'</p>
<p>'You told me. You said you were coming to-day, so when the
family decided on an expedition I suggested the Tower. They're
all over there looking at Waterloo.'</p>
<p>His thin distinguished face (so very much more distinguished
than any face that she had seen since Forbes-Robertson's)
flushed. He said:</p>
<p>'Then this is the place and this is the moment to tell you
that I love you, Meg. That I have always loved you and will
always love you. What am I to do about it?'</p>
<p>'And I love you too, Graham. But I also love my husband better
than anyone else on earth. I'm happily married and I adore my
children. So there is nothing to be done about it.'</p>
<p>The bearded guide, his flock close about him, arrived at that
moment, and began: 'Nothing here is worthy of especial attention,
but we shall see in a moment two curious figures, "Gin" and
"Beer," brought from the buttery of the Royal Palace of Greenwich
at the end of the seventeenth century, also the cloak on which
General Wolfe died at Quebec. . . .'</p>
<p>Graham looked into her face like a child asking for comfort.
'No, Meg, I suppose nothing. But if I could have you in my arms
only once. Just one night. After that I wouldn't mind, I think.
After all it ought to be my right, I think. It was <i>meant</i>
to be--'</p>
<p>Meg shook her head.</p>
<p>'But not now. You see, Graham, we're old. We would hurt people
even though they didn't know of it.'</p>
<p>'Isn't that rather conventional? What harm can it do to
anybody? You won't love anyone less because you love me a little.
You'll be enriched and so will I. You're right. We'll soon be old
and this is the last chance of our lives. Listen, Meg. Come away
for a night. I have to lecture in Oxford in June. We could stay
near there. Somewhere like Evesham. Some little place where no
one would see us.'</p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>'You'd be disappointed. It wouldn't be what you think.'</p>
<p>'It would be better than I think--far, far better. I'd have
something to remember and cherish. You too. It would give us a
bond.'</p>
<p>'We have a bond. Nothing can break it. Being together for a
night wouldn't strengthen it.'</p>
<p>She heard Fred's voice. 'That's <i>most</i> interesting. Now
for the armour. Where's Meg got to?'</p>
<p>She slipped away. She caught Fred's arm. 'All the armour's
upstairs, I think.'</p>
<p>'Weren't you interested in Waterloo?'</p>
<p>'I hate battles.' As they all moved to the staircase she
caught a swift glimpse of Graham's passionate beseeching
gaze.</p>
<p>In the Horse Armoury they collected, for use in Little
Frampton, some really splendid things. There was, for instance,
the case with the richly ornamented helmets of the sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>'I think,' said Fred, 'we'll have <i>that</i> one for the
centre of the dining-room mantelpiece. My idea is that we line it
with glass and then grow ferns in it. And <i>that</i> one shall
have Meg's odds and ends, the things she leaves all over the
room. And <i>that</i> one will do splendidly for snails and
oysters.' He asked the mild learned custodian: 'Do you think you
could steal a helmet for me?'</p>
<p>The custodian solemnly giggled.</p>
<p>'A heap of people make that joke, sir,' he said.</p>
<p>'Oh, but I'm quite serious,' Fred answered, and looked it. He
spoke in low confidential tones. 'I'll pay you an excellent
price. If you're caught I'll buy your ticket to Australia.'</p>
<p>The custodian shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>'You'd be disappointed, sir. Even if you got away with it
safely, what would you do with it?'</p>
<p>'Plant ferns in it,' Fred said. 'In Little Frampton we have
about forty varieties of ferns. They say that people come from
all over the world fern-hunting at Little Frampton.'</p>
<p>Kitty expected the custodian suddenly to turn upon her father
that hullo-here's-a-lunatic look that she had seen before in the
eyes of guides and custodians. But not so. There were so many
queer visitors every day that he thought nothing of this one.</p>
<p>'I expect you're right, sir,' he observed mildly. 'I collect
cigarette-cards myself--for my little boy.'</p>
<p>They had seen, however, at the end of the room the gilt armour
of Charles I on his horse, and he surrounded by figures of
cuirassiers and pikemen. The bearded guide was proclaiming: 'Face
of king and horse carved by Grinling Gibbons, and at the base you
will observe nine small cannon made for Charles II when a
boy.'</p>
<p>But what Fred Delaney observed, half hidden behind the large
case of armour to the left, was the lovely cheek and nose
surmounted by the little hat with the sparkling jewel of Miss
Alice Van Renn. He threw a quick look about him. Meg, her arm
through Bullock's, had wandered off to see the armour of James
II. Kitty was talking to the custodian.</p>
<p>'I thought you were a spook,' he said to Miss Van Renn.</p>
<p>She was dove-grey and silver and moth's wing and moonlight on
water. Chastity whose purity was lit with fire. As naked to him
as though she had risen from the waters of the armoured and
brutal past, the Venus of all cruelty and indifference. Fragile,
created out of foam, flower petals, silver web. And a lot more
nonsense. A bitch. He longed for her with such sexual desire that
the top of his head stuck to his hat, or it felt like it. He knew
why men strangled ladies who resisted them. He knew why men spent
thousands of pounds which they hadn't got in a jeweller's shop.
He knew why Troy fell. He knew what sailors felt on reaching port
after being at sea for three months. He knew why Antony threw
empires away. He understood thoroughly Don Juan, Christina of
Sweden, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and Rasputin. And, his
imagination running ahead of the event, he was aware of the chill
disappointment of all the gentlemen through history who have
escaped out of the window at three in the morning in their
shirts. All this he saw while the armour of the kings of England
swam, reeled, swung into curtains of swaying gold and silver and
resolved finally into the nine little cannons of the small boy,
Charles II.</p>
<p>'I'm not a spook,' Miss Van Renn said. 'How are you,
Fred?'</p>
<p>'You're a spook to me,' Fred said, putting his hand inside his
collar to push it forward a little. 'Always. I never get more
than a minute with you anywhere.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't know,' she said, appraising him quietly with her
most lovely eyes (and he felt his stoutness rising within him, a
shame and a derision). 'We see one another fairly often, I think.
Tea, luncheon, a walk or two--'</p>
<p>'Yes, and I don't know why it is, but there's always someone
interrupting. It's a sort of fate. I've got my family with me
now.'</p>
<p>'Yes, and I've got Mr. Bartlett. He's examining the
helmets.'</p>
<p>'Oh, damn Bartlett! I can't see what you find in him. He's the
most crushing bore--' He pulled himself up and said quite
piteously: 'Can't you see, Alice? Can't you understand? I want to
be alone with you. I want to take you out one evening--somewhere
quiet--I want--I want--'</p>
<p>He came beside her, pressing his stomach against the glass
case, catching her hand. 'You know what I want--'</p>
<p>'Yes,' she said, letting him hold her hand. 'I do.'</p>
<p>'Well, then--'</p>
<p>'Well--what?'</p>
<p>'Let me see you--'</p>
<p>'You can see me--whenever you want.'</p>
<p>'No--but alone.'</p>
<p>'And then--what?'</p>
<p>'I want to tell you.' He was choking. It was as though all the
armour in the room were closing in upon him. 'I love you. I
<i>have</i> loved you--'</p>
<p>'Here <i>is</i> Mr. Bartlett,' she said.</p>
<p>That irritating, stout bovine figure advanced happily towards
them.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Delaney!'</p>
<p>'Hullo, Bartlett!'</p>
<p>'Fancy finding <i>you</i> here!'</p>
<p>'Yes. Never thought I'd see anyone I know.'</p>
<p>'No. Nor did we. Did we, Alice?'</p>
<p>'Didn't we? I never thought about it.'</p>
<p>Fred moved away. 'So long, Alice. See you soon.'</p>
<p>'Why, of course.'</p>
<p>'So long, Bartlett.'</p>
<p>'Oh, darling,' Meg greeted him. 'We must hurry. They close at
five. It's the dungeons next.'</p>
<p>It was first the dungeons in which, as the bearded guide
explained to his devoted flock, 'No prisoners have <i>ever</i>
been drowned at high tide. Romantic idea I <i>will</i>
acknowledge and popular because, ladies and gentlemen, we are all
partial to horrors, and rightly so, but facts are facts and these
dungeons in which you are now standing are more than ten feet
above high-water mark.'</p>
<p>'The guide-book calls them the basement,' Fred said
disconsolately. 'There's romance for you!'</p>
<p>Followed the Beauchamp Tower where pathetically 'Jane' is cut
into the wall, followed the Regalia where jewels, looking more
like paste than any paste, blazed to the memory of Colonel Blood,
and so--there they all were--on Tower Green.</p>
<p>It had become, while they were tumbling through history, a
lovely serene and mellowed April day. The Green, with its small
square plot, paved with granite, gazed mutely into a sky of
shriven blue, mild, temperate with the shadows of a primrose dusk
stealing in veiled light behind the Tower. Here, on this spot,
suffered</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Lord Hastings<br>
Queen Anne Boleyn<br>
Margaret Countess of Salisbury<br>
Queen Katherine Howard<br>
Jane Viscountess Rochford<br>
Lady Jane Grey<br>
Robert Devereux Earl of Essex</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Fred took off his hat.</p>
<p>'Let us pray for the souls of all departed,' he said.</p>
<p>There were two gigantic ravens, their wings clipped, hopping
on the grass. One of them, a really enormous bird, fixed Delaney
with a cocked, inquisitive eye. Fred bowed.</p>
<p>'Henry, Eighth of that name, receive my condolences. You were
evilly entreated by women--more sinned against than sinning.'</p>
<p>Henry VIII winked at him in agreement, then pecked at a
feather. The scene was now of the deepest tranquillity. Miss
Franks and her charges, the bearded guide and his flock, all had
vanished. The little houses, like the discreet and decorous homes
of a Cathedral precincts, sat in a row of daffodils and primroses
against their walls. A white-wing-flamed seagull swooped against
the Tower's grey. The sky grew ever more primrose. The granite
slab was warmed in the gathering light. The four moved down the
hill, up the steps to the parapet outside the Beauchamp Tower
looking to the river. So tranquilly flowed the Thames, a barge
slowly slipping by; a faint ruffle of wind threw multitudes of
tiny grey feathers on to the waters. There was a scent of
flowers. Also of tar.</p>
<p>They leaned on the parapet, their bodies close together.</p>
<p>'You know,' Fred said, 'it is charming when we're alone
together. Better than <i>anything</i> else.'</p>
<p>'Much better,' said Meg.</p>
<p>'However delightful other people may be.'</p>
<p>'However delightful.'</p>
<p>'You know,' Kitty said, 'when we're by ourselves like this
every problem seems to be solved.'</p>
<p>'The cruelty of the past doesn't matter.'</p>
<p>'Nor the blindness of the present.'</p>
<p>'Nor the hazards of the future.' Fred Delaney's hand was on
Meg's shoulder. Very lightly he kissed the lobe of her ear.
'Darling Meg.'</p>
<p>As they moved away Fred said:</p>
<p>'Well, I won my bet. There wasn't a soul we knew. I said there
wouldn't be.'</p>
<p>'Not a soul,' said Meg.</p>
<p>'Only Henry the Eighth,' said Kitty.</p>

<h2>TIME PIECE: YOUNG MAN ON PAPER</h2>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Fragments from a Journal</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>. . . Until now, it is sad to reflect, I have written nothing
in this Journal worth a tinker's curse. That is perhaps not very
surprising when one considers what punk most Journals are, and
that Pepys is the only amusing one and Barbellion's is
interesting mostly because we know he's going to die very
shortly. Evelyn's is good in places, there are one or two French
ones, and I read all of Arnold Bennett's, and he must have been a
jolly good fellow, I think, although he cared more for hotels
than they are generally worth. Then there are the egotistical
ones like Marie Bashkirtseff's, but undoubtedly it's the hardest
thing in the world to write a good Journal without being
self-conscious and yet be interesting to other people. But one
oughtn't to write with other people in mind and I'm certain I
shall never show this to anyone else except perhaps Lizzie. It's
Lizzie who now makes the whole difference. I see I began this
about five years ago, and there are now about five exercise-books
full, but it's all the most awful rot--Aug. 5, 1932. Boulogne.
Bathed. Saw dark girl with beautiful legs. Lost twenty francs
Casino. . . . That sort of stuff.</p>
<p>But this is different. I want to be absolutely as honest as I
can so that I may know myself better for Lizzie's sake. Also it
will help my novel. Because I've never really tried to write
before, I can see that quite clearly now. Trying to make jokes
for <i>Punch</i> isn't really writing, although <i>Punch</i> is
awfully good if you like that sort of thing. Of course people
like Munden simply hate it. Then there was a time when I thought
I'd write like Wodehouse, but I see now it's no use trying to
write <i>like</i> anyone. What you've got to be is yourself, but
then is there any real self for me to be? Lizzie says there is,
and that's why I'm going to try and write a novel that, however
bad, is mine and mine only.</p>
<p>But first I'm going to be utterly honest to myself on paper to
see where I am.</p>
<p>I'm not in any way remarkable, of course. That's the first
thing. I'm just like thousands and thousands of other men of my
own age. But I'm going to put one thing down right away. I'm
awfully happy. That would sicken almost anybody if they were to
read it, because undoubtedly it's wrong for anyone to be happy
to-day with the awful state the world's in, so many unemployed
and probably a World War in a month or two. All the same I said I
was going to be honest and so I must be. I'm happy, I suppose,
for three reasons. The first is that I've got in father, mother
and Kitty the three grandest relations in the world. Secondly,
I'm in love with Lizzie, who is only a child at present but
simply beautiful in every way; and thirdly, I'm in excellent
health--there's nothing the matter with me physically in any way
whatever. I'm making a bit of money too--I made <i>£</i>136: 4: 3
last year, and this year so far I've made £83--£35 from
<i>Punch,</i> £15 from a short story, and the rest odds and
ends.</p>
<p>Do I feel it wrong to be happy? I honestly don't. Of course I
have my worries like anyone else. We may have to sell the house,
which would be frightful after its being in the family so long,
and I hate the world to be in the mess it is. Ought I to do
something about it? People like Munden feel that I ought. He's
working away all the time. The trouble is I don't know what I'd
work for if I <i>did</i> begin. I don't like Stalin any better
than Mussolini or Hitler, and I feel we've got the best sort of
government here in England. It isn't perfect, of course, but at
any rate we're free in England to say and think what we like, and
that's worth everything else.</p>
<p>The next thing is that perhaps father, mother, Kitty and I are
much too satisfied with ourselves. But then father and mother are
really remarkable. I don't see how you can think them anything
else if you really know them. They are entirely free of all the
worst faults--meanness and jealousy and cruelty and spitefulness.
And when you live with people like that all the year round it's a
great piece of luck undoubtedly.</p>
<p>But I must say I believe in families like anything. I know
most people think them rot these days, and in my generation lots
of people laugh at their parents because they seem to them slow
and sticky. But this must be the parents' fault partly. And
another thing is that my generation will be parents soon
themselves and then <i>they'll</i> be laughed at. But with us
it's never been like parents and children. Almost the first thing
I can remember is bathing at Eastbourne or somewhere and my being
carried into the water by my father and my not being frightened
because he was laughing, and I knew he wouldn't be laughing if it
was dangerous. It seems to me he's always told me everything from
the very first, about money troubles which we've always been in,
about the women he's in love with, and he explained to me all
about sex in the simplest way before I went to my Private. I
remember he told me I'd find I got in a mess sometimes because
beautiful women were beautiful women and there was no use
pretending they weren't. But then he's always been more
passionate than I shall ever be. He's a bit of a poet, I think,
which I'm certainly not, and the Irish is stronger in him than it
is in me. Then I'm afraid women will laugh at me because I'm so
small. I've fancied myself in love heaps of times, but I've only
had a woman once and that was beastly. And I never was
<i>really</i> in love until I saw Lizzie. All I want now is for
her to grow a bit and then we'll marry and then we'll have
children, which is the grandest thing I can imagine.</p>
<p>Then I must say a word about my mother because I simply don't
know what my life would have been if she hadn't been there. She's
most unusual. There's no doubt about that. You'd think from the
way she talks and behaves that she's all over the place, but as a
matter of fact she isn't. She seems careless and to say the first
thing that comes in her head, and always to be rushing about.</p>
<p>The truth is that more than most people she knows just what
she's doing. She's always throwing herself into other people's
lives and helping them, not because she wants to do good but
because she's made that way. Then, although she never says
anything about it, she's really religious. She thinks there's a
God and that Jesus Christ is alive and is with her wherever she
is. I don't believe that myself, but it makes her happy, and
she's so happy that perhaps she's right after all. What I say
about religion is that each man must go by his own experience and
it's silly rot to laugh at someone because he doesn't think as
you do. And anyway I know I'm not just chemicals as Munden
thinks, or I couldn't love Lizzie as I do.</p>
<p>Well, now about Lizzie. You couldn't call her beautiful, I
suppose, although she's beautiful to me, and she can look
beautiful sometimes when she's thinking of something she can't
see. She's just my height, which is very pleasant for me.
Although she's only sixteen she's very old for her age because
she's travelled all over the world with her father and seen
everything--many things it's terrible for a child to have seen.
And because she's seen everything and knows exactly how cruel and
wicked people can be, she's reached a kind of calm although she's
often very unhappy. Her father's the worst man I've ever known in
my life, and yet he can be very charming and amusing. He's bad
because he's got no sense of right and wrong at all and doesn't
mind how much he hurts anybody if he can get what he wants. The
funny thing is, I think he loves Lizzie in a sort of a way. She's
the only human being he does care for at all. He's going downhill
all the time, and I expect that once he was most charming and
very handsome and really did want to be a decent sort. But now
he's past caring and hasn't any strength of will at all, and
soon, I'm sure, there'll be some dreadful crash. When that comes
I must be there to keep Lizzie safe and see she comes to no harm.
Can I honestly say that Lizzie loves me as I love her? No, of
course I can't. She doesn't trust anyone in the world except her
aunt with whom she lived for a while in Westminster. She's seen
so much to do with sex that's horrible that she hates it all and
tries to keep herself from contact with anybody. But I think she
is <i>beginning</i> to trust me, and she liked mother very much
when she went to our place to tea.</p>
<p>An illustration of the unexpected, unusual person Lizzie is I
will give here because it is still very much in my mind. On an
afternoon last week we were in the National Gallery. We go there
quite often because we are sure we won't see anyone there we
know. Also, in the first place, because Lizzie really loves
pictures and knows a great deal about them, and now I'm beginning
to know something too because of what she's told me. We had sat
down in the long Italian room and I had just asked her if she
would write down for me the six pictures she liked best in the
Gallery. I have the bit of paper in front of me now.</p>
<p>She wrote:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>For young Mr. Delaney--<br>
<br>
I, Lizzie Coventry, solemnly declare that, in all the National
Gallery in London, England, the six pictures I like best are:<br>

<br>
N.B.--I don't say these are the <i>best</i> pictures. They're the
ones I'd like to have if I had a house.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>I'd just told her where I agreed and didn't agree when we saw
the oddest figure coming towards us. This was an old man with an
untidy grey beard, an old grey felt hat shoved down on his head,
a plaid shawl over his shoulders, and brown velveteen trousers.
He carried a heavy knobbly stick and was shuffling along as
though he couldn't lift a foot from the ground. He was muttering
to himself as he went, and yet I must say he didn't give one any
notion of senility. When he came nearer I saw that he had the
sharpest, brightest blue eyes I'd ever seen.</p>
<p>Well, when he was just opposite us his stick slipped on the
surface of the floor and I thought he was going to fall, so I
jumped up and caught him by the arm.</p>
<p>He turned on me quite savagely and snapped: 'I'm all right,
young man. Think I can't look after myself?' I'll confess I was
pretty aggravated and was for telling the old fool he could drown
for all I cared, but it was Lizzie who said with the utmost
sweetness:</p>
<p>'The floor is slippery, isn't it?'</p>
<p>He said: 'Yes. That's why I'm allowed to keep this stick.'</p>
<p>Lizzie, when she lets her real self come out, is like no one
else I have ever known. She is so compassionate that, although
she is herself only a child, she is like a mother to anyone in
distress. People might often think her hard if they hadn't seen
her on one of these occasions. She seems so cold and indifferent
to so many people. But this old man roused her tenderness. She
looked at him so sweetly that he was conquered at once and came
and sat down on the seat beside us. He talked then like anything.
He never stopped. He said his name was Lord Ragadoon and I knew
then at once who he was, an eccentric old man, very rich, a
collector of fine pictures and furniture, many of which he stored
away in an old castle in Ireland while he himself lived all alone
in some messy untidy rooms in London. People of course said he
was mad; but he wasn't at all mad, it seemed, in the auction
room. Well, he sat there talking to us about one thing after
another--pictures, with stories about Velasquez and El Greco (he
said he was the greatest painter who had ever lived), and the
best A.B.C. shops for toasted buns, and the iniquity and
ignorance of doctors, and a cure for rheumatics, and two cats he
had called Hore and Belisha. And he laughed a great deal, or
rather shook and rumbled in his beard. He had taken, it was
clear, a great liking to Lizzie, and he took her hand in his
gnarled hairy one and patted it. She talked away and laughed and
was simply adorable. He made us both give him our names and
addresses, and when he found I was partly Irish he was
delighted.</p>
<p>As I sat there, next to the funny old man with the grand
pictures around us, I can't explain why it all seemed so Londony.
It was somehow like Dickens with a smell of smoke and tobacco
(which came from old Ragadoon's clothes) and it had the
s<i>tillness</i> of London. You felt as though this grand Gallery
was planted there in the very centre of crooked chimneys and
narrow twisted streets and fish-shops, and the river with its mud
and old ships and the Houses of Parliament dusky on a winter
afternoon although the lights were on. I seemed to hear Big Ben
striking right along the Gallery floor. I have put this down just
as I felt it. It was so quiet and homely, and I loved Lizzie
twice as much as ever before. At last he got up and, nodding and
smiling back at us, went shuffling away.</p>
<p>Then, strangely enough, this little incident led to another--a
rather bold one on my part. Lizzie told her father about Ragadoon
and at once that rascally parent began to lick his lips over the
prospect of getting some of that old eccentric's money. He tried
to persuade Lizzie to bring the old boy to their place, and of
course this Lizzie refused to do. Then he had a violent scene
with her. What exactly happened I don't know, for she refused to
tell me, but there was a slight bruise above her left eye. She
seemed to be indifferent, almost contemptuous. I know her well
enough now to realize that that was her pride.</p>
<p>She lived alone, all to herself. She had seen that life was so
dangerous and that it could be so humiliating if you allowed it
that she had created a self-defence, self-remoteness that no one
was going to penetrate. I could discover two persons only in the
whole world for whom, in her secret heart, she longed, her aunt
Fanny, Mrs. Carlisle, and Mrs. Carlisle's son Edward. If she
spoke of them her voice shook a little; there was longing in her
eyes, poor darling Lizzie . . . darling, darling Lizzie. . .
.</p>
<p>Anyway I was sure in my own mind that a crisis in Coventry's
affairs wasn't far away. He was for ever drinking and day after
day having the most horrible rows with that beastly woman, Mrs.
Agar, who was calm enough herself and used to let him storm, but
I never knew a nastier woman. When you are going downhill and are
becoming seriously frightened of consequences your eyes get a
funny half-open look as though you were half-closing them so that
you might see some object in the distance more clearly. Coventry
had that look now, and sometimes he would draw his breath sharply
as though he were out of breath from running. I saw too that
Lizzie was herself beginning to be apprehensive as she had not
been before. In fact, half an hour before I wrote these words I
was with her and I realized fully that she is expecting something
dreadful to happen. May it not be long before I can protect her
and watch over her and see that she is happy and safe!</p>
<p>But now I must write something down about Fanny Carlisle,
because she is, I think, going to be important both in Lizzie's
life and mine. I decided that I must go and see her, so without
giving myself time to think of the cheek of what I was doing, one
fine afternoon about four down to Westminster I went, rang the
bell of the Carlisle house, and, to a stiff-faced
old-family-servant kind of woman, said I wanted to see Mrs.
Carlisle. She of course asked me my reasons, so I gave her my
card and said she was to tell Mrs. Carlisle that I was a friend
of Miss Lizzie Coventry's. The old family servant's brow darkened
at that and she gave me the stiffest kind of look, but she
disappeared with the card and a minute or two later said Mrs.
Carlisle would see me. She showed me upstairs to a jolly
drawing-room rather full with things, but then I don't like a
room to be quite empty except for an unintelligible picture and a
vase with flowers made of white linen. There was a grand Japanese
screen and some good pictures, and everything as bright as the
sun. These details, I suppose, have nothing to do with it except
that the brightness and freshness were all part of my idea of
Fanny Carlisle. I'll acknowledge quite frankly that she and I
took to one another at once. She is a lady getting on for fifty,
I should think, and reminded me a little of a smaller edition of
mother. She wasn't modern in dress or hair or anything; just a
rather stout, middle-aged, cheerful English lady who probably was
forbidden to read Rhoda Broughton's novels when she was a girl.
But I've never seen anyone look more honest or kind, and she had
a sort of gentleness that comes from understanding people and
being tolerant. I know she was awfully surprised to see anyone as
small and boyish-looking as I am. I'm accustomed by now to people
having that impression when they first see me, so I always try to
be quiet and sensible. It is much more dangerous for someone of
my appearance to say anything without thinking first than it is
for someone like Patrick Munden. I always have to remember that
and try to see myself as others see me.</p>
<p>I sat down, and Mrs. Carlisle asked me what I had come about;
I told her at once that I loved Lizzie and hoped in two years'
time to marry her. I said that I thought that she trusted and
liked me but didn't love me. I said that she cared more for her
father, Mrs. Carlisle, and her cousin Edward than for anyone
else. Mrs. Carlisle was very much moved by this and seemed at
once to trust me, because she told me something of what had
happened when Captain Coventry, her brother, and Lizzie had
stayed in their house. She said that he had behaved badly, they
had had a quarrel and he had left, taking Lizzie with him; that
since then they had never seen him or Lizzie and that they had
always loved Lizzie very much. I said then that I was sure that
Captain Coventry would soon be in some very bad trouble, and if
that happened would they help Lizzie? Mrs. Carlisle said at once
that of course they would love to. I told her something about my
family so as to reassure her, and said that I thought that she
and my mother would get on like anything. Afterwards she said,
smiling, she hoped I wouldn't mind but I <i>did</i> look very
young, upon which I said I wasn't as young as I looked and
practically earned my living by writing. I said 'practically' so
as to be quite truthful. She asked me what I wrote, and I said I
wrote for <i>Punch</i> and when she saw anything with the
initials 'S.D.' that was me; and she said that they took
<i>Punch</i> every week and she'd look out for those initials.
That was practically all, I think, and I must say I liked her
very much.</p>
<p>Afterwards I told Lizzie that I had been and I thought she
might be angry. But she wasn't at all. Only she was more moved
than I'd ever seen her. She asked ever so many questions, saying
the servant at the door was Janet and I hadn't seen Edward, had
I, and about things in the room. She remembered every detail.
Then she looked at me very gravely and said: 'Why do you do these
things for me?'</p>
<p>'Because I love you,' I said. 'And whether you love me or not
I am always going to look after you unless you ask me not
to.'</p>
<p>She said then for the first time that she would be very fond
of me, but she was afraid to because life was very cruel, and as
soon as you liked someone or something it was taken away. She
said, too, as though she were a hundred years old, that it wasn't
worth while for anyone to be fond of her because she had been
damaged, spoilt. Everything, she said, had come to her much too
early and she had lost all her trust and belief in things too
soon. Everyone lost it in the end, she said, but there were
generally some happy years first. So I laughed at her and said
that wasn't true, that my father and mother were well on in life
and hadn't lost their trust in anyone or anything. Lizzie said
that that was because they didn't see life as it was. It was like
romantic novels which tried to end everything up happily.</p>
<p>I said there were lots of happy people, people who loved one
another all their lives, and that I should love her always,
whatever happened. She looked at me and suddenly laughed. 'I
think we're both very silly,' she said, and for the rest of that
time she was happier than I'd ever seen her before, and I kissed
her before I went home. I think the knowledge that I had been to
the Carlisles and the knowledge that her Aunt Fanny still loved
her meant a tremendous lot to her--so I really had done a good
deed for once.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Coventry lately has really seemed to accept me as
one of the family. His behaviour would seem to me very
extraordinary if it were not that I believe that he is becoming
drawn into his own troubles and difficulties so far that he has
ceased to bother about anything outside them. He allows me to
take Lizzie out where and when I please. Sometimes when I bring
her back in the evening, after we have been to the theatre or the
pictures, I find play in his rooms at its height. Their
sitting-room is not large, but it is wonderful how many people
Coventry manages to squeeze into it. The place is thick with
smoke and everyone is so intent on what is happening that no one
pays any attention to us. Once the brown-faced half-caste at the
door has admitted us, that is enough. Lizzie slips at once away
to her own little room and there she stays. What fears and
terrors she must have then, although she tells me nothing--only
that there is quarrelling sometimes and a scuffle, some drunkard
thrown out or some argument about the cards. Well, this can't
last for long! That's one good thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile this has become the centre, the object of my life.
When I return to my room in Charles Street I feel as though here
in this quiet street is the heart of the real world. I'm neither
very clever nor very wise--in no way exceptional at all--but I do
know that the kind of love we have for one another here and the
love that I feel for Lizzie, this love is the one certain fact
that I know about life. No one can explain it away or give it the
easy explanation of sensuality or self-interest. Every kind of
trouble and cruelty and uncomfortable change can bluster and blow
on every side of it, but in itself it is sufficient reason and
explanation of life and, I am sure, is a promise of much greater,
finer and wiser things to come. Thousands upon thousands of
people alive to-day love one another as we love one another. Life
must be a battle, I suppose, otherwise where would growth come
from? I don't put these things very well, or in any new way, but
when I think of Lizzie in her little room and all that robbery,
greed, cruelty going on in the room next to her, I seem to
understand why there are these opposites, two worlds at war. If
there were nothing to fight for, what would happen to one's
muscles?</p>
<p>I'm much too shy about these things to say them aloud to
anyone. When I am older I shall understand more--or perhaps less?
At any rate this is what I understand now. Here in Charles Street
where, as I write, late, everyone else in bed except Kitty, who
is at a party, there is not a sound, only the clock ticking and
saying, 'Yes--yes--certainly--yes.'</p>

<h1><a name="c207" id="c207">CHAPTER VII</a></h1>
<h2>TIME PIECE: DEATH OF ANYBODY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Windsor Lad had won the Derby, and Mrs. Bathorne, who had put
her money on Colombo, gave a light-hearted laugh and told Meg
that it didn't matter in the least. 'My little all,' she said.
'Gone. I start, once again, from the gutter.' Old Mrs. Van Renn
said, 'Nonsense, Violet. You've always your diamonds.' Mrs.
Bathorne smiled complacently at the large glittering ring on her
finger and answered, 'Stuff, darling. They're all pawned. This is
paste.'</p>
<p>It was a hot afternoon in June, and Meg, who was in some queer
way apprehensive, wished that the Three Witches would get up and
go.</p>
<p>They sat about the room, rather close together as though
summoned from the vasty deeps by Shakespeare himself--Mrs. Van
Renn, Mrs. Bathorne and Lady Perivale-Hawder. Meg had not invited
them. Mrs. Van Renn had called (WHY? Meg asked herself), and
Violet Bathorne and Muriel Hawder had come together. They were
the type of old ladies common enough in our perverse generation.
In Millie Pake's youth they would have been <i>real</i> old
ladies, secure in lace cap, footstool, and wise sayings. They
would go to bed at ten and have a long sleep. They would be wise
about life, knowing everything, severe on folly, tickled by
scandal, generous and helpful in trouble that approached them
personally, fond of their food, strong, equable, living to
ninety.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Bathorne and Muriel Hawder, seen from the rear,
walking along almost any street, appeared like girls of twenty.
Front view, their eyelids lifted in cold and perpetual surprise,
their hard red mouths, the powder lingering in the crevices of
their salmon-pink cheeks, their smart hats, stockings and shoes,
they looked older and deader than Time. Naked their bodies were a
litter of bones. Clad so smartly they had slim figures. Every
inch of their persons demanded an unwavering vigilance. Very
costly too. Mrs. Van Renn was poor, but the other two won at
bridge, struggled for inside tips on the Stock Exchange, had a
man or two to wheedle, sold their possessions, ate nothing, lived
on a cocktail a day. What <i>was</i> miraculous about them was
their energy, for Mrs. Van Renn was all but seventy, Mrs.
Bathorne sixty-five or -six, and Muriel Hawder a trifle more.</p>
<p>Practically they never slept. They pushed, urged, fought their
way into parties, and could be seen at two in the morning at the
Ruritanian Ministry listening, with half-closed eyes, to M.
Dimanchenko working his way through all the Hungarian Rhapsodies.
By eight-thirty of the morning they were telephoning vigorously,
and by ten o'clock they were in Miss Sheepshanks' Beauty
Parlour.</p>
<p>This lack of repose led to a half-crazy, half-brooding glint
in the eye under the perpetually astonished eyebrow. A look of
apprehension too. And then quite suddenly they vanished. Someone
said at breakfast, 'Oh, Muriel Hawder's dead'--and that was
that.</p>
<p>But Meg, now, surveying them, wished--oh, how she
wished!--that they would get up and go. The afternoon was close,
but that would not altogether account for the apprehensive
brooding of this room and house. She felt as though something
terrible were happening or about to happen. It might be, of
course, in part, her own sense of guilt. Since that meeting in
the Tower she had had half a dozen encounters with Graham Pender,
and at the last, in this room, they had embraced with a passion
that had in it nothing either spiritual or philosophical. Fred,
had he been present, would have knocked Graham down. There would
have been no complacency or tolerance. She could not cheat
herself any longer. She had detachment enough also to realize
several other things: that there was nothing aesthetically
beautiful in the physical eagerness of a stout woman of middle
age, that such embraces led inevitably to one issue only, that
modern scorn for religion and marriage made adultery no prettier
than it had ever been, and that she in fact scorned neither
religion <i>nor</i> marriage, that she was grievously unfair to
Evie Pender, who might be a fool but nevertheless loved Graham,
that she herself, Meg Delaney, loved her husband Fred Delaney
more than ever before, that the possibility that Fred Delaney had
already spent the night with Alice Van Renn (and old Mrs. Van
Renn was paying a call, perhaps, <i>because</i> it had been so)
excused nothing--her realization of all these things did not
prevent her extreme boredom with these old ladies, nor her
conviction both of sin and of the exciting drama that life, even
when you were over forty, provided.</p>
<p>She was forced now to attend to Violet Bathorne, who was
insisting that she should share in her grievances:</p>
<p>'I know, darling, you <i>look</i> contented enough. I always
think both you and Fred are <i>maddening</i> as far as looks
go--but you must realize what I feel--to be pushed out of the
door, practically <i>pushed</i> out, and only because Clara has
had this money left her. No other reason whatever. And now she's
taking up all these Bolshevik young men and going to suppers in
coal-cellars, and she's written a letter to Hitler saying that
she is of the purest Aryan blood, but she wants him to understand
all the same that she sympathizes with the Jews and hates anyone
so narrow-minded . . . and <i>only</i> because she had this money
left her, and <i>why</i> that old man <i>did</i> leave her the
money no one can understand. Everyone thinks it <i>very</i>
fishy, and I'm really one of her best friends, if she only knew
it, always defending her, and so I told her this morning, and yet
she simply <i>pushed</i> me through the door. . . .'</p>
<p>Meg had to pull her mind back as one pulls one's dog when it
has seen another dog. Clara? Who was Clara? Oh, of course, Clara
Merlin who had been left all that money by old Colonel Woodhouse.
. . .</p>
<p>But when at last she answered, 'I haven't seen Clara since . .
.' she found she was confronted with Muriel Hawder.</p>
<p>'But tell me, dear. I'm sure you went to the first night.
Didn't you think it <i>stupid?</i> All about people at a holiday
resort--as though one cared. I certainly thought the Hyson girl
pretty sitting on that rock, but Freddie Carlyon was so stupid. I
was <i>determined</i> to go on to the "Al Fresco" afterwards, but
he said he had to be in bed early because of polo or something
the next day. . . . Yes, <i>Touch Wood,</i> that's the play. Who
<i>wants</i> to know how people like that live, although I
suppose they do run the country now and we've <i>got</i> to get
used to it. . . .'</p>
<p>Meg was used to Muriel Hawder's gabble. Muriel modelled
herself on the Corleone and had acquired a pitch of voice as ugly
and rasping as a creaking weather-vane. She spent her days in
arranging to be taken to the theatre and opera by reluctant
males. She would telephone like the wind through the wallpaper
and say: 'Any time in the next fortnight. I hear it's <i>such</i>
a good play. You get seats and we might have supper at the
Cosmopolitan after.'</p>
<p>But Meg knew that Mrs. Van Renn was her immediate business.
And she was. She said:</p>
<p>'I was so glad to see Fred yesterday afternoon. He came in for
a cup of tea. He was looking superb.'</p>
<p>Meg realized several things: that Fred had lied to her,
because, last evening, he had said he had been all day at Epsom,
where he had had a tiresome piece of business. 'Came straight
back,' he had said, kissing her. She realized also that old Mrs.
Van Renn admired Fred greatly and, had she been a little younger,
would have entered into competition with her own dear Alice. The
battle that, months ago, on that New Year's Day, had first been
joined, was now all about her ears. <i>Not</i> a battle between
herself and Fred--she was sure that nothing could injure
<i>their</i> relationship. But a battle for her own integrity and
purity of soul, for Fred's, for the possession of this house, for
the safety and well-being of the house, London, England, all that
was right and good in the world. She was not at all dismayed by
her sense of peril and apprehension. She rose to it gladly. But,
all the same, her alarm was real, and the first thing she would
do would be to rid herself of the Three Witches. So she rose and
pushed the bell. 'Only,' she said, smiling, 'I've forgotten. I
<i>have</i> to send Caesar with a message.' It was enough for
them.</p>
<p>They all departed. Muriel Hawder began to Mrs. Van Renn, as
she went out, 'It's a Cochran first night. The twenty-fourth, I
think. I'm going to see if . . .' She was already deep in her
next campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Caesar didn't come, which was as well, for Meg had nothing to
tell him. He could clear the tea away. He had been depressed
lately. She must go and see his horrible old mother again. She
sighed. The house weighed on her head like a ton of coal. She
could scarcely breathe. Something was the matter. And in this
house. It gave her no surprise at all when the door opened and
Millie Pake stood there.</p>
<p>Meg cried out: 'What's the matter? What is it, Millie?'</p>
<p>'Yes. Something terrible has happened,' Millie Pake
answered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Millie Pake, earlier on that afternoon, had been turning some
clothes over. Helen had stayed in bed that day because--well,
because she had not wanted to get up. More and more now she
stayed in bed, and it was as well, for more and more she lived in
the past (or was it in truth the present if she thought it was?).
Living thus in one room or another, bed or chair--what did it
matter? In bed she was warm, for, although now it was June, Helen
shivered in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>She was about to die, as Millie well knew. A few months more
and she would be gone and Millie would be alone. Millie had
always been one to face facts, and the one that she faced now was
that she was in excellent bodily health, that she would have two
pounds a week to live on, that she would <i>never</i> live with
her brother, that no one would want her, and that she would miss
Helen every minute of her waking day, that she would probably,
thus poor, hungry and unwanted, live for years.</p>
<p>She was neither sentimental nor despondent at this prospect,
but she <i>was</i> a little frightened. Try as she might she
could not altogether calm her fears. Suppose the little dividends
that still trickled into her lap ceased altogether? Suppose her
health did suddenly fail? After Helen was gone she could not, she
knew, afford to go on living in this flat, although she would
like to, because Helen would be nearer to her here than anywhere
else. Where would she go? Nothing in the world is such a bore to
even the kindliest people as a very poor, single old lady! She
knew that there were societies for aiding old gentlepeople, and
very good things they were; but she thought, with an ironic
shudder, of herself receiving some coals or a nice warm blanket
at Christmas.</p>
<p>Well, what of it? She had had really a lovely life, and Jesus
Christ would remain in company with her however poor and tiresome
she was. She had no patience with the old people in novels who
whined and lamented. Jesus Christ was often so close to her that
she heard His voice, and it had, often enough, a touch of irony
about it. He had never had, she fancied, a great deal of use for
lame dogs, nor had she herself. He would dislike it very much if
she showed any sign of becoming a lame dog, and certainly that
was not what she was going to be. She had had an Aunt Sybella
once who, in spite of arthritis, a weak heart, and losing all the
hair off her head in a fire, had been, to her ninetieth year,
full of spirit, wit, and scorn for her fellows. Millie did not
scorn her fellows, but where Aunt Sybella had gone she could
follow.</p>
<p>Sitting there now, turning over her dresses, listening for a
second lest Helen should wake and want her, she did wish that she
could buy some new clothes. She was old and no beauty, but a dark
wine-coloured evening frock she had seen in a Hanover Square
window had filled her with longing and desire. She had turned
these old dresses again and again, and the grey silk was so
familiar that it was ashamed to look her in the eye. She stroked
it affectionately. Poor old dress! Surely one gave the clothes,
the furniture of which one had been for a long time fond, some
kind of living, sentient personality? No. That was nonsensical
sentiment. She was sick of the old dress, and that was the
truth.</p>
<p>The mad notion came to her of stealing the wine-coloured
dress. No good. She didn't know how to set about it. How
<i>did</i> you steal things? That was the worst of an honourable
upbringing, the sort that she and Helen had received.</p>
<p>Her mouth full of pins, she grinned. Then she stole to the
bedroom door and saw that Helen was quietly sleeping. Then she
heard a sound.</p>
<p>She had been sitting with the door into the passage, and the
door beyond that, open because the afternoon was close. Now she
fancied that from the flat below, from the Pullets' flat, there
came a noise.</p>
<p>She went into the passage and stood at the hall-door
listening. Imagination. On an oppressive afternoon like this you
fancied things. There was no further sound. All the same she was
uneasy. She could hear the beating of her heart. The house, in
the silence of the oppressive June afternoon, seemed nevertheless
to be full of noises. Around and about her beating heart and
mingling with it were rustles and whispers as though boards were
creaking, plants rustling, clocks ticking. But when she forced
herself to hear <i>beyond</i> her heart there was no sound at
all.</p>
<p>Nothing had happened. And yet, as though she had been
commanded by someone stronger than herself, she moved down the
stairs.</p>
<p>On the next landing she saw that the flat-door of the Pullets
was ajar. This was so unusual that her earlier fears were now
confirmed and came running back to her, whispering as they came
'I told you so.' Well, it was no affair of hers. No doubt one or
other of them had but just come in and forgotten to close the
door. At a moment Smoke or Dodie would be there. (She could hear
Dodie's pleasant warm voice crying, 'Smoke, you idiot, you forgot
to close the door.') He, or she, would look out into the hall
before closing the door, and then how foolish she, Millie Pake,
would seem, standing there without any reason.</p>
<p>She went back to the stairs, but then no one came. She waited
and now heard quite clearly, from within the flat, the sharp
meticulous ticking of a clock. It was, at least, careless of them
to leave the door open. She went back and knocked on it timidly.
There was no answer and she knocked again. Then she rang the
bell. She heard the bell ring, the clock tick. For the rest the
silence was intense. She pushed the door wider. Suddenly into the
outer hall came the pale Siamese cat that Dodie Pullet had
possessed for some two years--possessed, as she often said
laughing, in pretence only. There was never a cat more
unpossessable. Aloof, unperturbed, this creature moved like an
ironical spirit to the head of the stairs. Then it turned and
looked at Millie with eyes of cold ironical disdain. But Millie
was not looking at the cat. On the surface of the carpet over
which the cat had stepped were tiny paw-marks of blood.</p>
<p>Millie did not, if life gave her a crisis to deal with, fear
or hesitate, but for a moment the lower staircase swung up at
her, suspending the cat as though it would hurl it into space. A
second later all was solid and material. She walked into the
sitting-room. The bedroom door was wide open. First she saw the
reflection in the long deep mirror that stood opposite the bed.
In the mirror was the bed's width, the fresh piled pillows, and
Smoke in his pyjamas, sloping over the bed, the upper part of his
body hanging towards the floor. From his chest blood was
dripping, and she saw quite clearly in the mirror the tiny
cat-marks proceeding from the blood-pool on the carpet to the
door.</p>
<p>She turned to the reality, saw the revolver on the floor, the
crimson bedroom slippers on his feet, and the signet ring on his
finger shining in the sunlight that poured in from the bedroom
window.</p>
<p>'Oh, poor, poor Smoke!' she said aloud, facing her own
reflection in the mirror. Instinctively she made no movement. She
knew that he was dead. She knew at once that she must disturb
nothing because of the police. She saw that there was a letter on
the table beside the bed.</p>
<p>Where was Dodie and what must she, Millie, immediately do? It
might be hours before Dodie returned; she must find out at once
where Dodie was so that she might telephone to her. She went back
into the sitting-room and discovered then that her legs were weak
beneath her. She sat down on the sofa and looked about her at the
metallic furniture, the black and white decoration, and a large
cluster of silver-tinsel branches and leaves in a high white
vase.</p>
<p>'Oh, poor, poor Smoke!' she thought again and found that she
was crying, tears rolling down her dry cheeks. She did not
attempt to stay them but only sat there, clasping and unclasping
her hands. Where was Dodie? She <i>must</i> be found. She got up
then and moved about, looking if she might find some
engagement-book or pad. But the room was icily bare. Not a thing
about, only in a corner near the window a very modern basket made
of twisted white wood, cushioned in black--the home of the
Siamese cat. Then, like a knife cutting paper, there were voices.
A moment later Dodie and Patrick Munden stood in the room.</p>
<p>'Why, Millie--' Dodie stopped. 'But where's--'</p>
<p>Millie said, 'Wait.' She rubbed her wet cheek with the
knuckles of her hand.</p>
<p>'But where's--' Dodie said, and moved towards the open bedroom
door.</p>
<p>Millie put her hand on her sleeve.</p>
<p>'No, don't. . . . Smoke's hurt. Don't go in for a moment.'</p>
<p>But Munden strode past them both. For a moment he disappeared.
Then he returned, closed the bedroom door and stood with his back
to it. He looked Dodie straight in the face.</p>
<p>'Smoke has shot himself. He's dead.'</p>
<p>Dodie moved towards the door.</p>
<p>'No, you're not to go in. Not yet.'</p>
<p>She was furious. 'Of course I am! Do you think I'm a child?'
Then she said what Millie had said: 'Oh, poor, poor Smoke!'</p>
<p>But Munden didn't move.</p>
<p>'No. . . . Wait . . . until the doctor's been.'</p>
<p>'Oh, the doctor!' Millie cried. 'Doctor Roach. . . .' She went
across to the telephone.</p>
<p>Dodie spoke like a man. 'Get out of it,' she said to Munden.
'This isn't <i>your</i> affair.'</p>
<p>Munden let her pass. He stood looking in front of him while
Millie telephoned.</p>
<p>'Yes, Doctor Roach, please. . . . This is Lady Mildred Pake. .
. . Oh, is that you, Doctor Roach? Could you come at once to . .
.' She moved away from the telephone, saying to no one in
particular: 'He will be here almost at once.'</p>
<p>Dodie was in the room again and said: 'No one is to touch
anything. The police will have to come.' Then looking at Munden
she said (she was holding in her hand a sheet of notepaper):
'This is what he says:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>'DARLING--For a long time I've thought I would be
better out of your way. I know you're fond of me and I thank God
for it. I know you're in love with someone else too. And I know
I'm useless and an encumbrance. I'm perfectly sane as I write
this and quite happy--sane enough to fancy I may be given a
chance somewhere else. If I'd had some brains I might have got
somewhere, but in this new world you're quite useless without
brains. Perhaps where I'm going they'll give me some brains.
Remember, darling, I'm quite sane and quite happy.</blockquote>
<blockquote style="text-align:right;">'Your
devoted              <br>
<br>
'SMOKE.     </blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>'They'd like to read this at the Coroner's inquest,' Dodie
said. 'But they won't. And no one's to tell them. Do you
understand?' she said, looking at Munden. She tore the paper into
tiny pieces.</p>
<p>'I shan't tell them,' Munden said.</p>
<p>She bent down and picked up the fragments of paper. She went
back into the bedroom, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>'We're in love, but we're not lovers,' Munden said in a dull,
almost sullen voice to Millie. Millie said: 'I ought to go in
there to her.'</p>
<p>'No. Leave her alone. Poor Smoke! What a hell of a life!'</p>
<p>'It's not my business,' Millie said. 'Why didn't you--'</p>
<p>'Why didn't I leave her alone? Because life's a mess, a silly
blasted mess. My love for her is the only decent thing I've got.
And it wouldn't have made any difference. Smoke's better dead,
and so would millions alive to-day be.'</p>
<p>Millie shook her head. 'Of course I don't think so. But I
<i>do</i> think Smoke will be happier where he is.'</p>
<p>Munden glared at her. 'That rot!' Then he lowered his head
almost as though he were praying. He raised it again. 'Please
forgive me. I don't mean to be rude. All that seems nonsense to
me. . . .'</p>
<p>Millie said: 'I think you don't see far enough. You must see a
very long way. I don't think death's very important, and perhaps
you'll find that out now you're in love. . . .' She gave a little
anxious movement. 'I don't like her being alone in there.'</p>
<p>He answered: 'She's wise. She's sane. She'll let no one help
her either now or ever. Smoke was the weak one. Men <i>are,</i>
these days, compared with women.'</p>
<p>Millie turned her head away. In spite of herself she was
crying again and she didn't want this fierce young man to see her
weakness. To her great surprise he put his arm around her and led
her back to the sofa.</p>
<p>'Sit down. It must have been an awful shock to you. I was fond
of Smoke too, you know, and yet I can't help loving Dodie.' He
patted her shoulder as though he were her mother.</p>
<p>Doctor Roach came in. They told him what had happened and he
went into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Millie thought, 'I must tell Meg.'</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c208" id="c208">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>
<h2>TIME PIECE: DUCHESS OF WREXE'S BALL</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Little Brun was one of those who dined with the Corleone
before the Duchess of Wrexe's ball. 'Little' was indeed the word
for him now, poor man. The neat, dapper, inquisitive recorder of
1900 was now in 1934 shrivelled, meagre and wan. Only his sharp
little eyes and the Legion of Honour in his buttonhole had
colour. What was his age now? Anything from seventy to ninety. No
one cared. His own world was gone, shrivelled like himself to
nothing. He detested and despised this present one. His old
weaknesses, that he loved good food, good wine, malicious gossip,
were in evidence to-day as forty years ago, for he disliked and
despised his hostess and should not therefore be accepting her
hospitality. But he was present once more to assure himself of
the end of all things and especially of England. <i>Not</i> of
English Society--<i>that</i> had gone long ago--but of England
herself as a power and a glory. This might once have saddened
him, for he had always loved England, but he was now altogether
beyond any emotion save a rather greedy bitterness. His stomach
was still in good order and so he could enjoy Corleone's
excellent food. But the conversation! As he sat there he thought
of the great ladies of the London pre-War world--Lady Ripon, Mrs.
Keppel, Lady St. Helier, Mrs. Willie James--and he blushed for
this yellow-haired chattering monkey, and the world that
tolerated her. Corleone, the widow of an Italian nobleman, talked
much of her adopted country. She had still a palace in Venice,
with a Veronese, a Tintoretto, and a handsome gondolier. She
screamed, she laughed, and once and again her small pale eyes had
a look of frightened appeal. Some young friend of hers had
written a wonderful novel about the miners in Wales.</p>
<p>Brun interrupted. 'You should read <i>Germinal.</i> Oh, I know
no one ever <i>thinks</i> of Zola now. All the same it's a great
work, terrible, dark, underground. A marvellous prophecy, too.
These young men, what do they know about miners?'</p>
<p>But no one paid him any kind of attention. The ladies on
either side of him talked across him. They were laughing at the
young Duchess, whose Ball they were attending. The girl's old
mother, they said, was a terror. Brun thought of <i>his</i> old
Duchess all those years ago! Had she entered the room at this
moment! Oh, but didn't he wish she could!</p>
<p>At one remove from him was sitting Larry Delaney, an amusing
fellow whom he had known idly for years in London. Delaney seemed
to Brun prophetic of a coming return to absolute barter--'Give me
shoes; I give you shaving-cream.' Only, while the world still had
a real possession or two, Delaney dealt in Louis XIV beds and
Tang horses and Venetian shell-back chairs. Delaney was a common
coarse fellow, but Brun liked him for his irony and good spirits.
He was vulgar, greedy, selfish, but he was perceptive. His voice
was raised a little now and he was talking about his brother:</p>
<p>'Fred? . . . Why, yes, Princess, you can see him to-night if
you wish to. He'll be there <i>with</i> all the family.'</p>
<p>'You always speak contemptuously of your brother,' Corleone
said. '<i>I</i> think he's charming. He doesn't rob us as you do.
I wish I saw him more often!'</p>
<p>'Rob you! No!' Larry said, laughing. He regarded his hostess
with bold impudent eyes. He had no respect for her. He knew her
greediness too well. 'Fred would rob nobody. He is altogether
honest. Perhaps that's why we patronize him, for we all do. That
and his happiness. His whole family are happy always.'</p>
<p>'Impossible,' said Captain Merivale Basting, a pink-faced,
good-natured imbecile whom Larry despised because he insisted on
his War courtesy-title. 'No one is happy always.'</p>
<p>'Ah,' said Corleone. 'That is his wife--the big fat blowzy
woman--forgive me, Delaney--your sister-in-law--but of
<i>course</i> she is happy. She is religious and does not think
about diet. She talked to me at some cocktails somewhere once
about Jesus Christ--as though He were in the room, I mean.'</p>
<p>Delaney was irritated. After all, Meg <i>was</i> his
sister-in-law and a damned fine woman. But he grinned friendlily,
for always, one must remember, there were things to buy and sell.
He had drunk good wine, however, and was impatient with the
stupid women on either side of him (also he detested the rosy
cheeks of the 'Captain'), so he lost some of his caution. He
leaned forward, turning his smiling buccaneer face upon all of
them. 'But they <i>are</i> happy, my brother's family,' he said.
'And it isn't only Freudian or a kind of clever hypocrisy either.
It's quite real and comes from real causes. I'd say it's because
they all four of them take long views and are devoted to one
another--really love one another, you know. What I mean is that
they aren't frightened by every little thing that turns up, as
most people are these days. They take a long view. After all, if
they do lose their money or get cancer or a war comes--well,
history's a long time making!'</p>
<p>'It's all very well if you've plenty of money,' Miss Nancy
Mohun, a girl as beautiful as she was sincere, as sincere as she
was stupid, remarked.</p>
<p>'But they haven't,' Delaney went on. 'They have very little
indeed. They take in lodgers.'</p>
<p>'Family love,' Corleone said. 'How appalling!'</p>
<p>'Yes, I know,' Delaney answered good-humouredly. 'That's why
we all patronize them. I myself think them very tiresome often
enough. All the same, they're the best people I know anywhere.'
And so much for you, you old bitch, he thought, enjoying the
<i>bombe surprise,</i> and wondering whether Miss Mohun were
really a virgin, as gossip sarcastically reported.</p>
<p>'All very old and stale,' Brun thought. 'Stale and old. Old
and stale.'</p>
<p>The dining-room was, in the fashion of that year, entirely
white: white curtains, white table and chairs, flowers made of
white silk in the white vases. The women moved and their sheathed
bodies, crimson, gold, silver, white, black, were like echoes
from the movements of a dance that had once been fresh and
exciting.</p>
<p>'It's all lost its spring,' Brun said, as though to
himself.</p>
<p>Delaney answered. 'There's still a lot of fun going.'</p>
<p>'I suppose so. I'm very, very old. Never felt older than
to-night.'</p>
<p>'Wait till we move on.'</p>
<p>'Ah, move on! I've seen some balls in my time. This one--'</p>
<p>'Different, of course,' Delaney said. 'Not so grand. Possibly
more lively. Grand in its own way too. As I see it, this is a
more real world, this new one.'</p>
<p>'There <i>is</i> a new one, then--not only the pale corpse of
the old?'</p>
<p>'Why, of course.' Delaney laughed. 'Only it's rough,
hazardous, cynical like all new worlds.'</p>
<p>'I thought new worlds were young, idealistic, full of
hope.'</p>
<p>Delaney grinned. 'Don't you believe it. New Athens, the
Renaissance in Florence, Elizabethan England, America in 1790.
Fierce, vulgar, scornful.'</p>
<p>'I'm tired,' was all Brun said. 'I've seen so many new worlds
in the last twenty years.'</p>
<p>They all moved on, crowding into the motors, slipping away
through a flare of light, cries and voices, pools of darkness,
and at last into the wide, rather pathetic emptiness of Portland
Place.</p>
<p>There was a broad red carpet and a crowd of feminine faces,
hoping that from one car at least some film star would emerge.
No, but to-night there would be Royalty, so the crowd grew and
grew. A sleek black cat ran, furtively, before the policeman
could prevent it, across the strip of red carpet.</p>
<p>Brun moved up the steps into the hall. He waited for their
party to assemble and, looking back through the open door, saw
the London night sky pale blue and tender like a beneficence. He
was very soon to die and, once again as so often before, asked
himself why these moments of such perfect beauty should occur, or
rather why he, nothing, the child of nothing, destined for
nothing, as he so firmly believed, should have so deep a
perception of beauty. There had been perhaps no period in the
world's history so altogether pagan as this present one--and yet
religion would undoubtedly return in one form or another. Man
could not live without it--childish, brave, pathetic man. One
intensely brilliant star glittered above where Broadcasting House
so confidently had planted itself, and the London hush, ancient
gentleness, ran like a sleepy flood about men's feet.</p>
<p>'There they are,' Larry Delaney's voice said at his side. 'My
family, I mean'--and little Brun, for some no-reason, remembered
how, in this same house, all those years ago, he had greeted
Rachel Beaminster and wondered what her life would be.</p>
<p>Meg Delaney, radiant, excited as a child at a circus, came
sailing up the steps, followed by Fred, Kitty, Bullock and little
Lizzie Coventry. Through Connie Beaminster she had obtained
invitations for Lizzie and the Graham Penders. The great question
had been--could Lizzie be made to look old enough? But Lizzie had
reassured them. Her hair had been pulled back and fell to a
little roll of curls that crowned her pale thin neck and
shoulders. She wore a white dress with a rather long skirt, and
over her bosom a thin gold chain of coins curiously cut. This,
she said, had been given her father by a lady in Dubrovnik for
some service he had rendered.</p>
<p>She looked young, certainly, but not a child. Her face was as
serious, Bullock told her, as though she were going to be
married.</p>
<p>Larry introduced them all to Brun. Brun looked at Meg with
curiosity. So this was the happy blowzy lady who was so frankly a
Christian! She was certainly not blowzy to-night. She carried
herself magnificently. In her black hair was a small tiara of
diamonds. Her dress, he thought, was of a rich deep purple with a
short train. She reminded him, yes, more than anyone he had seen
for a long time, of the ladies of his youth. Not that she was
old-fashioned; her gaze was clear, unhypocritical, courageous.
Her large dark eyes sparkled with the anticipation of
pleasure.</p>
<p>'I came as a child here once,' she told him, 'with my father
to tea with the old Duchess--and wasn't I frightened! I'll never
forget that old woman sitting by the fire at the end of the long
drawing-room, and we had to walk all that long way. I thought my
drawers were coming down. There was a big grey Persian cat, I
remember, and little marzipan cakes.'</p>
<p>Little Brun asked her about her father. He had known him well.
'This is the child of that old scoundrel,' he thought.</p>
<p>'And poor Rachel Breton. Of course she was years older than
me. But how I used to admire her! It was her Russian blood, I
suppose, made her seem so romantic. Ah, dear me--I was dreadfully
sentimental then--am still for that matter!'</p>
<p>As usual Meg had been standing there talking in people's way
when they should have been moving like sheep and goats, men one
way, women another. Kitty felt one of those momentary impulses of
wishing her mother were different, <i>more</i> conscious of what
other people were doing.</p>
<p>'Come along, Mother. We're holding everything up.'</p>
<p>'Are we, dear? . . . Well, Mr. Brun, we'll be having a talk
later, won't we? Where are we all? Lizzie, come with me,
dear.'</p>
<p>Two minutes later they all met again and began, with so many
others, to climb the great stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The young Duchess knew well enough what everyone was thinking.
She had not been married long enough to make many friends. In her
own country town there had always been a plentiful supply of cats
and monkeys. After all, London was only a larger town. In any
case she could not be unhappy nor alarmed, because her husband,
who loved her so much, was standing beside her and seeing her
through everything. Looking down the staircase at the figures
pressing up towards her, the men magnificent with their orders,
the women as beautiful as once, in Cherry Minton, her small town,
she had imagined that in fairyland they would be, it had the
quality of dream, of nowhereness, of perception and touch and
hearing being all at the mercy of the stroke from a clock as
Cinderella once found it. . . . She was shaking hands with the
Prime Minister, who was exactly like the Cherry Minton doctor,
and, in spite of the decorations and evening clothes he was
wearing, there was surely a pipe in his mouth and the clothes
covering his sturdy body were of the rather faded pepper-and-salt
that old Doctor Warnsley never varied for twenty years. Looking
into one of the kindest, most trustworthy faces in the world, she
grinned, just as once she had done when Doctor Warnsley asked her
to put out her tongue.</p>
<p>'Balls in general,' Mr. Baldwin said to her, 'are a weariness
of the flesh to me. But not this one. . . . How are you,
Wrexe?'</p>
<p>Mrs. Baldwin gave her a very motherly look, taking everything
in and deciding immediately what to do about it.</p>
<p>People are saying, the Duchess thought to herself: 'She's not
bad-looking. Holds herself quite well. Must seem funny to her
after the life she's led.'</p>
<p>She remembered how her husband, kissing her in his
dressing-room that evening, had said to her: 'One day we'll go to
Cettinje. That Dalmatian coast's lovely. In Cettinje there's the
old Montenegrin palace, shown to tourists, ten dinars a time.
Most melancholy place you ever saw--hideous furniture, and
hundreds and hundreds of family photos, Victoria's family--all of
them, German, Italian, Greek, Russian, Montenegrin. Lots of the
two poor Russians. All so grand, in groups, in every kind of
uniform, the ladies in immense hats--all so grand, so commanding,
so powerful. Now all dead--many of them murdered. None of them
mattering a damn. There are some nice people in London you'll
make friends with. We'll laugh at the others--together.'</p>
<p>But she didn't feel inclined to laugh as she saw them coming
up the staircase. She felt a great tenderness--but then she was
very young and, as yet, not at all cynical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meg, with her husband, sailed into the grand ballroom like the
queen of some gipsy kingdom that despised its neighbour,
Ruritania, for insipidity. She would indeed have made the late
lamented Flavia look like one of those white silk flowers in
Corleone's dining-room. Meg sometimes read books by very clever
men who poured contempt upon parties. This she always thought
<i>must</i> be a pose. For who could but adore parties? And a
ball like this one? She was ageing. Her vitality would go, her
zest, her sense of fun. This might be her last great ball.
So--she would savour every slightest tang of it! But, more than
this, she was in her own absolute world. Were Fred, poor dear, a
millionaire, instead of penniless, she--Meg--could give a ball
that would astonish London. And yet there was something here that
the house itself, so triumphantly aware of its own past history,
gave, something that no one could imitate. It was not the
portraits of dead Beaminsters--Lely and Van Dyck and Reynolds and
Gainsborough--gazing perhaps rather apprehensively from the
walls--apprehensive because ancestors to-day were worth nothing
except for the prices they might fetch at Christie's--nor the
superb crystal chandeliers, nor the splendid Adam
fireplace--possessions, however beautiful, do not give England
and London their quality--but rather the certainty, arrogance,
defiance of time, that the building and the human beings moving
with it asserted.</p>
<p>All sailed along together. The quality that made Englishmen so
rightly hated, but that should also have made them trusted--the
simple, childlike certainty of permanent survival and
unchallenged superiority. Was that great quality to end now? Was
England's contribution to the little adventures of this pigmy
star concluded? Meg at least did not think so, for to her it was
like coming home to a family gathering after a long exile.
Whatever form the future world might take, there would still
surely somewhere be this English calm, this English arrogance of
common sense. She and Fred and Kitty knew everyone, and danced,
laughed, chattered almost, as Larry ironically observed, as
though it were a Delaney party. Bullock never left Lizzie's side.
But there was one thing that didn't occur to Larry, something
that, behind the scene, never left the Delaney consciousness for
a moment--Smoke Pullet's suicide.</p>
<p>We are all aware of those events that bring us quite suddenly
into a new reality, a world of experience that makes our everyday
world as thin as a Japanese wall. Before the new experience we
alter our scale of values and climb into a fresh comprehension of
existence. For the moment only. The force of the event slackens.
It is not, unless there is a world catastrophe, repeated. It
thins to the shadow of a skeleton on the ceiling. But we are
changed.</p>
<p>Smoke's death had so affected the Delaneys. For Meg at least
it was something towards which she had for a long time been
moving. There had always been something 'fatal' about Smoke, and
with that ill-omen of his personality the house too had been
stained. She believed, being simple and old-fashioned, very
definitely in the powers of evil, and in fact welcomed the
conviction that life was a battle. She had been sure, ever since
that New Year's Day when her brother-in-law and Alice Van Renn
had appeared in the doorway, that this year 1934 would be 'the
very devil of a battle'--for herself, for Fred, for the house.
Through the spring she had been preparing to meet it; now, with
Smoke's pistol-shot, the fight was really engaged. She was
sensible. She did not feel it a great tragedy either for Smoke or
Dodie. But she had liked him, been deeply sorry for him. His
death had thrown an atmosphere of ill-omen over the house, the
flat was empty, she fancied that people looked at herself and
Fred as though they might have prevented it--and there was, she
was certain, worse to come.</p>
<p>So that, perversely, she intended to enjoy this ball with all
her might. Who knew but that, within a month or two, she and Fred
might be out on the street?' Who knows but the world may end
to-night?'</p>
<p>She was sorry for poor Smoke, for Dodie, for Patrick Munden,
for all and everybody, but life was larger and longer than
personal misfortune, and God meant you to enjoy the delightful
things as they turned up. This was one of the delightful
things.</p>
<p>She had a word with Royalty and talked and danced with all
sorts. In spite of her weight and size she danced beautifully and
with so great a spirit of enjoyment that it was a delight to
watch her. Young Rawdon Temple languidly commended her: 'You
know, Mrs. Delaney, you look as though you hadn't a trouble in
the world.'</p>
<p>'Do I? That's odd--because I have a number.'</p>
<p>Temple was a tall, very thin young man, in the best society
because he had married a scion of the house of Wintersmoon, but
famous in certain circles too because he wrote the longest
possible poems on the tiniest possible objects. There was his
epic, 'The Snail's Journey,' and a vast unfinished poem, 'The
Flea's Chronicle.' He took himself as Munden took himself, very
seriously, but they represented the two opposed worlds.
Meanwhile, perhaps because he wrote so much, he spoke as little
as possible, and when he did speak it was with the air of
despatching from Heaven a few grains of manna upon the starving
Israelites. Meg found him exquisitely absurd.</p>
<p>'How's your poem about the frog getting on, Mr. Temple?' she
asked him. He looked at her, but there was no mockery in her
innocent gaze. So she was just a fool.</p>
<p>'Very well,' he answered her kindly.</p>
<p>Her next partner gave her one of the real shocks of her life.
This was Colonel Robert Beaminster, first cousin of the present
Duke, a handsome kindly man, some forty years of age, more than a
distinguished soldier because he was interested in the arts and
had a little house, filled with beautiful things, in Wiltshire
near Wintersmoon. When they had danced a little while, he said:
'Mrs. Delaney, do you think Fred and yourself would object if I
asked Kitty to marry me?'</p>
<p>'Kitty!' Meg stopped where she was. He gently urged her on
again.</p>
<p>'Yes--why not?'</p>
<p>'But you scarcely know her!'</p>
<p>'Oh, but I do. I've met her numbers of times, especially
lately. Of course I'm old. I know that. Nearly twenty years too
old. I've been in love before, of course, but never like this. I
fancy myself young for my years. I--'</p>
<p>'But has <i>she</i> any idea?'</p>
<p>'Not the slightest. We're friends though, I think. I've money
enough and, so far as I know, no ruinous habits. I'm not terribly
set in my ways although I've been a bachelor so long. I'm old
enough to be sure. I love her, body and soul, as they used to say
in the old romances.'</p>
<p>Meg smiled, a divine, maternal, infantile smile. Oh! if Kitty
could or would! It would be the loveliest, most perfect thing! Of
course he <i>was</i> older, but Kitty was mature, not one of
these chicken-headed, idiotic girl-babies.</p>
<p>'Object? No, of course not. But it's absolutely for Kitty to
say.'</p>
<p>'Yes, of course.'</p>
<p>Meg stopped.</p>
<p>'Wait a minute. I can't dance any more. Let's sit here.'</p>
<p>They sat down.</p>
<p>'Since when have you thought of this?'</p>
<p>'Oh, for some time. I loved her at sight, I think--about a
year ago. Do you . . . does she like me, do you think?'</p>
<p>'I can't tell, of course. To be quite honest, she's never
mentioned you to me.'</p>
<p>'No--she'll have to get used to the idea. I don't mind how
long I wait.' He jumped up. 'As a matter of fact, since you say
it's all right I'm going to ask her now. She said that the next
dance should be mine.'</p>
<p>Kitty was approaching them. Beaminster said to her: 'Do you
mind if we don't dance this, Kitty?'</p>
<p>'No, of course not. I've been dancing a lot. Are you all
right, Mother?'</p>
<p>'Perfectly all right, darling.'</p>
<p>Beaminster led her off. He took her out of the ballroom, up
some stairs, into a little quiet room that contained only one
picture. Beaminster closed the door and they sat down. The music
came to them faintly like the refrain of a river.</p>
<p>'Look at that,' Beaminster said. 'It's my favourite picture in
the house. It's by Tintoretto and is a study for the big Manna
picture in Venice.'</p>
<p>'Yes. It's beautiful,' said Kitty.</p>
<p>'I should think it is. Look at those blues and silvers and the
deep red of that woman's dress. And see how active everyone is.
In Tintoretto's pictures everyone is doing something urgently.
That woman bending down to pick up the manna, holding the baby by
one hand. . . . The interesting thing is that El Greco came to
Italy as a very young man and was greatly influenced by
Tintoretto. You can see it--the long extended bodies, the
opulence of some of the figures, a sense of light and thunder,
the dramatic intensity . . .'</p>
<p>He suddenly took her hand.</p>
<p>'Kitty, I want you to marry me.'</p>
<p>She sat there staring in front of her. Then she turned and
looked at him incredulously.</p>
<p>His hand trembled on hers.</p>
<p>'Yes. Don't be surprised. Although of course you must be.
Think it over. Get used to it.' Then, holding her hand more
tightly, he went on urgently. 'It's a new idea to you, but I
think I fell in love with you a year ago. The very first meeting.
There was a kind of quiet happiness about you. . . . I've been in
love before, but never like this. I was engaged once, but we both
found it wouldn't do, and so this time I've waited a year. Of
course I'm forty. You may think that makes it impossible. But it
doesn't. I'm very strong, perfectly healthy. Our children would
be thirty or more before I'd be anything like an old man.' His
voice trembled.</p>
<p>She was incredibly touched when she saw that his eyes were
full of tears. She looked at him gravely as though she wanted him
to realize how greatly she felt honoured. But she shook her
head.</p>
<p>'How kind you are and good! I like you so much. But it's
impossible, I'm afraid--and must always be.'</p>
<p>'I expected you to say that. I knew you must. You must think
it over. See me a little. Get to know me. I don't mind how long I
wait.'</p>
<p>It had never remotely approached her--the idea that he loved
her. He had been only one of a number of nice men she knew in
London. Thrice before men had asked her to marry them, but on
each occasion she had known that the proposal was coming.</p>
<p>But the queerest thing of all, she thought, as she stared at
the woman in the red dress bending down to pick up the manna, is
that, six months ago, I might have accepted him. He is charming.
I might have grown to love him. Mother and father would be
delighted. Everything is right about it except possibly his age,
but I had always, until lately, liked men older than he is. And
now what prevents me? It could not be a young man in a curiosity
shop, nor that shop itself (the strange name Zanti going on
through the years--Spain, Cornwall, London, although of course
she knew nothing of this), nor a picture in a shop window, nor a
wall beautifully decorated, nor the crude paintings of a man
laughing up at her from his couch--none of these things, all of
these things . . . simply a new world of which she was now
citizen, a world to which Robert Beaminster could never, never
belong.</p>
<p>He went on: 'I don't want to pay compliments, but you are
different from anyone I've ever known. Life is such a mix-up,
isn't it? The kind of confusion that Shakespeare and Keats felt.
So much nastiness--our bodies, our thoughts, our mean shabby
acts. I don't understand any of it. Who does? The moment I saw
you I felt that there was no confusion--you were someone to live
by. You moved so quietly and honestly--'</p>
<p>She broke in: 'Please! You're altogether wrong about me. I'm
terribly ordinary--not even <i>half</i> educated. I'm nothing yet
at all--I've got everything to do, to learn.'</p>
<p>'We'd learn together.'</p>
<p>She shook her head again.</p>
<p>'No. I want you to realize <i>why</i> it's impossible. Six
months ago I had no idea of anything. I had my home and my
friends. I went about like any other un-ideaed girl. I'd read
nothing, seen nothing, thought nothing. Then little things
happened, apparently unconnected. I met someone, I saw a picture
somewhere . . .' She smiled at the question in his eyes. 'No. I'm
not in love. Or I think not. But I do realize now, as I didn't a
little time ago, that there's a world of experience waiting for
me that I must accept. If I don't I miss everything. I suppose
that's true of everyone--only perhaps I shall never see it so
clearly again. Things cloud over, I expect, as one gets
older.'</p>
<p>'And I'm not in that world of experience? I could never
be?'</p>
<p>'So it seems to me now.'</p>
<p>He took his hand from hers and got up. He stood, looking down
at her with a gaze of great wisdom and tenderness.</p>
<p>'I know what you mean. You've been very honest with
me--only--as you go on, this world may merge into another. That's
what happens. I'll wait.'</p>
<p>'You know,' she said, half between laughter and tears, 'in old
novels they always said: "But we can be friends, can't we?" I
mean that I want a good friend very badly.'</p>
<p>He gave her his hand and pulled her to her feet.</p>
<p>'Friends always. There's nothing I won't do.'</p>
<p>They went out and down the stairs. At the end of the ballroom
she found her uncle Larry. Beaminster left them together.</p>
<p>'Let's sit down here and watch everybody,' Larry said. 'He's
been showing you the Tintoretto. I don't think it's genuine.
Probably by a pupil. Lots of his big pictures are only partly by
himself. He worked at such a pace. "Last Suppers," you know, for
Venetian churches at extravagant prices. Old Beaminster's a good
sort but an awful sentimentalist. Wonder why he's never
married.'</p>
<p>Kitty liked her uncle but didn't, at that moment, wish him to
throw his cynical regard on either Tintoretto or Robert
Beaminster. She wanted him to talk, so that, under the protection
of it, she might recover her own proper self-control. It had been
her self-discovery, not Beaminster's proposal, that had excited
her so strangely. She <i>was</i> moving into a new world. What
<i>hadn't</i> life now to offer her? It was as though she were
seeing things with a double vision--intensified realization and
intensified imagination both together.</p>
<p>'Now--tell me things about people.'</p>
<p>The Three Witches were quite close to them: Mrs. Van Renn,
Mrs. Bathorne, Lady Perivale-Hawder. They were sitting on a
little gilt sofa, their heads close together as though they were
muttering spells. The great room now, under a haze of soft light,
magically formed the colours, the decorations of the men, the
dark-light intermingling of rose and black, white and silver and
malachite, into a ballet symmetry moving, it seemed, to some
inevitable climax. Larry went on talking.</p>
<p>'It's perhaps the <i>last</i> great London ball. No, of course
it <i>isn't,</i> but one has a kind of Brussels-before-Waterloo
feeling, hasn't one? England's being so fine and noble. She
doesn't want <i>anything</i> from <i>anybody.</i> Why <i>will</i>
other countries be so selfish and grasping? Well, of course, she
doesn't because she's <i>got</i> everything. For years and years
she's had the world in her pocket. But the world's in her pocket
no longer. Everyone thinks now they'll have a little bit of what
England's got. How's she going to deal with it? Give up a bit
here and a bit there or try to keep the lot? Don't you think the
bright young things of the 'Twenties look a bit silly now we're
in the 'Thirties? There's Bertie Colton still thinking he's a
bright young thing. He gave a grand party last week in the
country and everyone had to come as a vegetable. Nancy Eldon he's
dancing with, went as a cauliflower and was a huge success.
There's young Brinsley--he's run through twenty thousand in five
years. Funny thing is he's a very nice chap. Who's that elderly
elegant your mother's dancing with?'</p>
<p>'That's Sir Graham Pender,' Kitty said.</p>
<p>'Never heard of him.'</p>
<p>'No. He was a flame of mother's when they were young. He's
been abroad all his life.'</p>
<p>'They've stopped. They are coming towards us. Who's the
missionary female they're talking to?'</p>
<p>'That's Lady Pender, Sir Graham's wife.'</p>
<p>'Meg looks as though she's up to some mischief. I know that
look.'</p>
<p>Some young man was approaching Kitty with a proprietary air.
Larry got up.</p>
<p>'I must be moving. I've some business to do--to persuade
Lucile Mounsey to sell those tapestries of hers.'</p>
<p>Kitty agreed to have the next dance with the elegant young man
who, looking at her with appreciation, said: 'Thought I'd only
look in for a moment. Never stay at a dance long, you know. Have
something to drink and then move on. But this is a bit different,
don't you think? Glamour and all that sort of thing.'</p>
<p>Kitty suddenly thought of Smoke Pullet. Why? She saw him as at
the last time she had spoken to him--Smoke coming down the stairs
of the Charles Street house.</p>
<p>'How are you, Smoke?' she had asked him gaily.</p>
<p>He had smiled, his charming, lonely, friendly smile.</p>
<p>'You know what, Kitty,' he had said. 'For the first time in my
life I've got a job I like.'</p>
<p>She was delighted. 'Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad, Smoke. That's
grand.'</p>
<p>He had paused at the door.</p>
<p>'It's not a job anyone else would like much, though,' he had
said and went out into the street. Next day he had killed
himself.</p>
<p>But Smoke's death, after she had recovered from the first
shock, hadn't saddened her. That was strange because she had been
fond of him. Her own death--if she knew, for certain, that within
three hours from now she would be dead--would neither sadden nor
frighten her. She knew, as she moved off with the elegant young
man, that she was too profoundly sure at this moment of her
vitality for death to be anything but the ghost of an event.
<i>Real</i> events had quite another shape and form.</p>
<p>'Quite a decent band, don't you think?' the young man
said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would be absurd to pretend that Meg Delaney had not often
in life acted foolishly. She knew very well her own danger-point.
Her recklessness was roused always by something that her father's
blood gave her. 'If I don't have this piece of fun now I may
never have it.' Life was for her at times translated into a kind
of fairy-tale, she was the fairy princess hitherto disguised as a
beggar maid, and the fairy prince had just asked her to marry
him. Would she not be an idiot indeed if she did not accept? So
it had been when at the age of fifteen she had run away from
Cannes and spent the night quite innocently with the young son of
the Bishop of Dorlinton. So it had been when, aged twenty or so,
after dinner at Madame de Florac's, she had gambled all her
jewels, her dog Gisel and her maid Eva away to Mrs. La Tone. So
it had been when, after Graham Pender had gone to China and she
was feeling very lonely, she had engaged herself to an acrobat at
the Tivoli music-hall, resisted his attempts on her virtue, and
was only saved by his arrest on the Saturday evening for the
attempted knifing of another acrobat.</p>
<p>To-night she quite suddenly threw all her bonnets over all the
windmills. She said to Graham Pender, as they were finishing
their dance:</p>
<p>'Yes, Graham, I will. . . . I'll come for a weekend somewhere.
It's wrong. It's wicked. We are both too old for it to be
anything but ludicrous. And yet it isn't. . . . I shall tell Fred
afterwards.'</p>
<p>She was looking lovely and incredibly young. It was her colour
that was so perfect, the colour still of a girl, the darkness of
her hair lit by the diamonds, her carriage superb.</p>
<p>He only said, 'I'm in luck to-night, Meg--the happiest of my
life,' left her with a little bow, and they did not meet again
that evening.</p>
<p>She had immediately afterwards the strangest conversation with
Lady Pender, a conversation that should have shamed her
dreadfully, but, as this is a truthful story, it has to be
confessed that it did not. She had detested all her life to hurt
or distress anybody. In all her escapades it had only been
herself that she had ever harmed. She was now contemplating
something cruel and unkind, but her recklessness, caused partly
by Smoke's death, partly by a desperate sense that she was in for
trouble anyhow, partly by the force and maternal tenderness of
her feeling for Graham, partly by the excitement of this night
and the sense that there was intrigue going on everywhere up and
down, in and out of this Ball, and partly by her old
child-persisting complex of loving to climb a dangerous tree
because some other child had dared her to do it, her recklessness
made the world about her seem iridescent, a little drunken, a
little mad, a great deal doomed: 'Who knows but the world may end
to-night?'</p>
<p>And so, because she was intending to do Evelyn Pender the
greatest hurt in the world, Meg felt towards her a kindness,
beneficence, generosity, that was altogether a new element in her
relation to the Penders.</p>
<p>They sat down together and watched the scene. Really,
<i>how</i> queer a creature was Evelyn Pender! Was there no one
to tell her <i>anything</i> about clothes? What had induced her
to wear that queer green turban-like thing on her head, that
Venetian coral necklace? Too much make-up was bad, but how
powerfully a little rouge and powder rightly applied would help
that tight pale mouth and those bony cheeks?</p>
<p>Meg said: 'It's a lovely ball, isn't it?'</p>
<p>Evelyn Pender looked straight in front of her, her long,
stiff, slightly freckled hands clasped together on her lap.</p>
<p>'You know,' she unexpectedly said, 'it's you that ought to
have married Graham, not I. Why didn't you?'</p>
<p>'He went away and left me,' Meg said, laughing.</p>
<p>'Are you sorry now?'</p>
<p>'Lord, no! I wouldn't be married to anyone but Fred in the
world.'</p>
<p>'You love him very much?'</p>
<p>'I adore him.'</p>
<p>'Then,' Evelyn Pender said, turning round and fixing her with
her grey eyes, 'he doesn't mind your flirting with Graham?'</p>
<p>'Do <i>you</i> mind?' Meg asked her.</p>
<p>'I don't know. I can see that it's perfectly natural. Graham's
terribly in love with you. I do hope you won't make him
unhappy.'</p>
<p>Meg nodded her head. 'We mustn't be unhappy, any of us. We
needn't be if we're sensible. I love my husband first, last and
all the time. No one counts for me beside him. Graham knows that.
Do you hate me, Evelyn? Am I making you unhappy?'</p>
<p>Lady Pender was a long time answering.</p>
<p>'No. As long as Graham is happy. He was never in love with me,
but he has come to rely on me, to like to have me there--and I
think that, plain and unattractive as I am, I'm lucky to have
been given a man as attractive as Graham to feel like that about
me. I've always thought that some other woman would turn up. No
one has until now, and it may be it's as well that it's someone
who <i>has</i> other ties as strong as yours are. I don't trust
you, but somehow I'm not afraid of you. I rather like you. I
can't help it. But don't make him unhappy. Don't go a long way
with Graham and then drop him.'</p>
<p>'I don't trust myself,' Meg said. 'I never have. But I promise
you that if things get difficult I'll come and ask your help and
advice. And I won't hurt Graham--I promise that too.'</p>
<p>Then Evelyn Pender looked quite sentimental. But it wasn't Meg
that caused it.</p>
<p>'There's only one thing I'd like to-night,' she said. 'And
that is to look at Mr. Baldwin. I do admire him so. Do you think,
if he's still here, we could . . .?'</p>
<p>'We'll go and find him,' Meg said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This night was a great stage in her development for Lizzie
Coventry. It was, for one thing, by far the happiest moment of
her life until now. For a brief while she threw off entirely her
distrust of man, and when later, as was inevitable, she resumed
it, it was not quite the same distrust. There was a rent in the
nasty fabric. It was wonderful to her that these Delaneys had
taken her to this great ball. They were not, then, ashamed of
her!--for she bore always around with her, night and day, bore it
with proud defiance, this sense of shame. There was no indecency,
meanness, cruelty of which she was not aware, and it seemed to
her that all the world must know that <i>she</i> knew! Moreover,
with the exception of her aunt and the family in Westminster,
Lizzie had never known anyone whose word she could believe, who
would not desert her, betray her, instantly forget her. It seemed
to her the rule of life. And now once more, in these Delaneys,
she had encountered a family who seemed to mean well by her. They
were quite different from her relations in Westminster--much more
gay, adventurous, of altogether bolder colours, but now, by
taking this trouble about her, by dressing her up to look older
and then publicly before all the world presenting her at one of
the most famous of London balls as their friend, they had done
her honour. Her gratitude was warm, moving, stirring about her
heart, although outwardly her small pale face, resolutely set,
gave no sign of emotion.</p>
<p>But, most of all, she was grateful to Bullock. She was not
sure, as she looked at his sturdy little body and round kindly
face, whether her liking were not changing to something warmer.
He reminded her of St. George in the Bellini picture (how awful
had been that year in Venice when Mrs. Egret had made that
shocking scene with her father in that old yellow-walled palace,
accusing him of stealing her diamond bracelet, and how they had
hurried afterwards in that gondola to the station, panting,
perspiring on that dreadful August afternoon!), his fidelity and
modesty and rock-of-Gibraltar reliability! And then he had
talent: Lizzie was sure that soon he would write a very good book
indeed.</p>
<p>But how strange the contrast! Lizzie as she danced with
Bullock thought of that moment this evening in the rooms before
she left, when her father, in his pyjamas (for he had been
sleeping all day), smelling still of drink, his eyes half closed,
had pinched her ear and said: 'Darling--any of your grand
friends--handsome young men with fortunes--bring them along
here--introduce them to your old dad. They'll be welcome.' And
now, in this splendid room, the women so beautiful, the men so
fine, the snarling rhythm of the band, the great portraits on the
wall, above all the young Duchess who, although she had not known
Lizzie in the least, had given her so sweet and, as it seemed, so
personal a smile. Oh, this was another world, a world that she
had never known before, but from which, it seemed, she was not
absolutely excluded!</p>
<p>'Are you happy?' Bullock asked her, as they moved quite
perfectly together. 'There's Winston Churchill.'</p>
<p>'And there,' said Lizzie, 'is that old man we met in the
Museum.'</p>
<p>And so he was. When the music stopped they stayed quite close
to him and he recognized them instantly. Old Lord Ragadoon looked
quite as eccentric as he had done at the National Gallery, but it
was to-night a kind of aristocratic eccentricity. Why he looked
such a swell it would be hard to say. It was not the Orders that
he wore nor the old shapeless evening clothes, nor the shaggy
untidy beard; and he stood bending forward with no fine presence.
It was his eyes, perhaps, which had the piercing fiery look of a
proud, contemptuous but exulting eagle. Yes, it was his eyes,
Lizzie concluded, and his bony hands and the iron-ribbed neck
above the reluctant collar.</p>
<p>'So you're here, are you? Very pleasant. Dancing fun?'</p>
<p>'Yes, sir. Great fun,' said Bullock.</p>
<p>'I was a good dancer in my day and women were handsome then.
Something to put your arm round--not these scraggy leg-of-mutton
creatures!'</p>
<p>Then abruptly, staring at Bullock under his shaggy brows, he
said:</p>
<p>'Why don't you come to see me? I gave you my address, didn't
I? Thirty Pelham Street--up three flight of stairs--no lift. Any
afternoon after four.'</p>
<p>He patted Lizzie on the shoulder.</p>
<p>'You've grown up since I saw you. Suits you.'</p>
<p>Then he shuffled away.</p>
<p>'You see,' Bullock said to her. 'You've grown up. He said
so.'</p>
<p>She put her hand through his arm and walked with him proudly.
Yes, he was like the Bellini St. George. Or, perhaps, St.
George's son. She was beginning to be, quite fiercely, proud of
him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There comes a moment in every function, great or small, when
the question that has been asked all the evening is answered: 'Is
this thing a success?' It is just then that for the wife of the
Vicar of Portcullis, or the Bishop of Polchester, or the Hon.
Stephen Herries, M.P. for Rasselas, or His Grace the Duke of
Wrexe, the evening's fate is settled--at the moment when the
coffee comes in ('I told you that girl would make a hopeless
servant'), when the Beethoven Sonata is ended. 'Everything went
wrong from the first. Cook has always made that fish soufflé
perfectly before.' But it wasn't so. The thing was still in the
balance. One really funny story from the Vicar and all might have
been well. '<i>In spite</i> of the fish it all went very well, I
think.'</p>
<p>It was, at a certain moment, for Fred Delaney, as though
fireworks had exploded through the great windows into the hearts
of the dancers, changing them, with whirling colours of blue and
crimson--stars and rockets and Catherine-wheels--into the Italian
Harlequinade of Longhi, Pantaloon and Harlequin--or moving from
that towards a huge Veronese canvas, a superb decoration without
heart, the noble Duke in green splendour raising his arm while
the Fool plays in his corner, the cat is under the table, and up
the stairs climb the servants holding the golden goblets and the
peacock on its lordly dish. So it was decoration now spread
against the wall of the night sky, fronting the dark battlements
of the sleeping city. The Ball was the success of the year. That
bunch of idle young men, passing derisively from ball to ball,
the terror of the indignant hostess, they had all stayed. Royalty
itself had stayed to an astonishingly late hour, and there, in
the little room papered with the old maps of the counties of
England, Fred Delaney had held Alice Van Renn in his arms and at
last, at last, had kissed her again and again, had heard her
say:</p>
<p>'Yes. Why not? I'll come with you somewhere sometime.'</p>
<p>It was settled then. The conquest was made. When he had taken
her back and left her to one of her admirers, he vanished (to be
for a moment alone) up the stairs again and found himself,
without intention, in the room with the Tintoretto painting.
'Damned fine painting,' he thought. (He was still breathing
fiercely, the palms of his hands were hot, his heart was racing.)
'Wonder who it's by? What's its subject?' He bent (although his
mind was so absolutely elsewhere) forward to see the name on the
little gilt plate--'Tintoretto. Ah, yes, the "Bacchus and
Ariadne" man.' Then he saw, lying almost at his feet, a woman's
handkerchief. He picked it up. It made him think of Meg. Beloved,
adorable Meg! And he was intending once again to be physically
unfaithful to her! Perhaps for the last time. Physically only. He
turned towards the door, stopped as though hit in the chest by
the vision of the lovely Alice, so quiet, so well-disciplined, so
sensuous. And he would not hurt Meg for the world. Oh, not for
all the world and all the women in it! But this little pleasure
he must have, and then--'who knows but the world may end
to-night?'</p>
<p>The little handkerchief was crushed in his hand. Was it from
that small square of lace there came to him the thought: And if
Meg were unfaithful to you--only, you know, physically? A little
joy for her before she settles, as you too are going to do, into
a faithful domestic tranquillity? Would you mind? Would you care?
Oh, but Meg--she <i>could</i> not! Meg unfaithful! But <i>why</i>
not? She's still a fine woman with passions, desires, a longing,
as all women have, for the unknown? No <i>real</i> infidelity,
Fred Delaney. No more real than yours will be. Different for the
woman . . . but in these wise tolerant days haven't we exploded
that nonsense? Are not women doing everything that men can do?
Why not this freedom as well? But then Meg is religious. She
believes in God. Yes, but is she not gipsy as well, has she not
her father's blood in her? Lightly he ran down the little
staircase again. He stood at the corner of the passage whence,
from a small balcony, he could see down on to the ballroom.</p>
<p>Oh, but he was happy! Life was fine! There was a doom hanging
over them all. Smoke's shadow was at his elbow. The great ceiling
of the ballroom split and the sky with a myriad of stars shone
through. Under this brilliant fire the Town shrank, as the little
handkerchief was shrunken in his hand, into a crumpled heap. The
machines roared across the sky. Flame tore the cupped canopy and
a great cry arose. Then there was silence and over the ruined
plain the waters slowly climbed, reflecting the stars in their
whirling torrent. He shook himself. The torrent was the band. A
trumpet cried and the dance stopped.</p>
<p>His shoulder was touched and he found that Larry was at his
side.</p>
<p>'I've been having a drink.'</p>
<p>Fred grinned. 'Come on. The night is young. I'm dancing this
next one with my lovely daughter.'</p>
<p>Passing through the ante-room they saw in a gilt and velvet
chair a little old man fast asleep.</p>
<p>'Who the devil's that?' Fred asked.</p>
<p>Larry looked.</p>
<p>'It's poor little Brun. You met him. He was dining with me at
Corleone's. A little old Frenchman--rather a swell once--in his
day.'</p>
<p>They went on into the ballroom.</p>

<h2>WE MEET BECAUSE WE MUST</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As the light-years run at this present instant the river
breaks through the Green Park and the blue-painted citizens are
hunting the slimy eel-snake in its marshes, the countryfolk are
chasing the wild boar in its woods, the citizens of Westminster
are picnicking in its glades, and Claude Willoughby is taking the
air and listening to the band and arranging in his head the
disposal of his treasures after his death.</p>
<p>At this, our 1934 conviction of time, the Green Park is dusty,
for it is the first week in September and we are blind to the
marshes, the river, and the pleasant country dances. Behind
Claude, out of his view, but present to his consciousness, are
the Devonshire Gates, and early this morning the cheery, plump
bachelor with the front windows of a 90 Piccadilly flat, awake
and thirsty, has moved into the sitting-room, drawn back his
curtains, and seen, under a trembling grey sky, the old man
wrapped entirely in newspapers asleep under the gates, and on the
bench three derelicts huddled together for comfort until the
policeman arrives to move them on. The old boy, in his silk
pyjamas, gives himself a whisky and soda, watches the light stir
behind the thin skeleton of grey, salutes Westminster tower, the
Victoria Memorial, glances down the sleepy nakedness of
Piccadilly, and toddles back to his sheets. Five o'clock strikes
from Westminster. For the Green Park is democratic if it is
anything. The splendid avenue of trees from the Gates to the
Memorial could be a Triumphal Way for armies, but in actual truth
it is a pathway of liberations--liberations for clerks,
shopkeepers, lovers, athletes, and, most especially, the dogs of
Mayfair. These last pass, all day, across the dangerous rushing
waters of Piccadilly traffic, straining at their leashes, cockers
and airedales, dachshunds and fox-terriers, one purple-tongued
chow who walks by himself, scornfully picking his way through the
dangers, and one cat on a silken string, its mistress also
cat-like. On the dusty surface of the grass the dogs break into
ecstasy, the children throw balls and kites into the air, the
weary cast themselves on to their backs and stomachs, the lovers
press close together, and the grimy sheep play sulkily at a
directed Arcadia.</p>
<p>All London presses in upon these trees and this grass. It is,
if you like, the very centre of the world, and the spokes of the
wheel radiate out to the green icy silences of the Poles, the
dusty mysteries of Tibet, and Lenin mummified in Moscow. But this
centre of the world is also the backyard of the universe. Nothing
is real here but the trivialities of the meanest human, and out
of these trivialities the great works of art must come--a lovers'
quarrel, a worker's dream of idleness, a dog's realization of
ecstatic joy, a child's wondering contemplation of a cloud
sailing into a tree. When, with a bang rather than a whimper, the
life of this star is ended, those cries, murmurs, petitions,
ecstasies, slumbers, are not ended with it, but are immortal
because everything created is immortal--even, it is to be feared,
the Victoria Memorial.</p>
<p>So now Claude Willoughby, nodding his head to the school-girl
lushness of <i>Madame Butterfly,</i> is immortal, and his present
discontents are no more, in his unending history, than the
drifting of the dusty air into the band-conductor's nostrils.
<i>Butterfly</i> is completed. The band-conductor blows his nose,
and Claude thinks to himself: 'Very pleasant. Very pleasant
indeed. I do like something with a tune in it.'</p>
<p>He is looking pale and worn, for throughout a breathless
August he has been under Brocket's eye, sleeping very little,
eating very little, the rumble of Time's chariot in his ear ever
more loudly.</p>
<p>It is better, however, in the summer in many ways. You need
not shiver over a sulky grumbling fire, you can sit outside on
Park benches, and watch the fountains play in Trafalgar Square,
and see the evening sun slant with loving fingers across the
faces of the Charles Street houses.</p>
<p>For Claude has been very much in Charles Street of late,
walking up and down, looking up at the windows--for who knows? At
any moment he may see the pleasant faces of that nice girl and
that nice boy, and so life become at that instant the safer. But,
strangely enough, he never has. Nevertheless Charles Street seems
the safest place. Almost everywhere else is dangerous and his own
room the most dangerous of all. He would have left it all long
ago, but now he is three weeks behind with the quarter's
rent--and doesn't Brocket know it? Brocket comes even more often
to his room. He never dreams of knocking now. He stands there,
his stomach heaving, the hairs crawling on his arms, not saying
anything until at last quietly he murmurs:</p>
<p>'If you can't pay your rent soon you'll have to sell those
things of yours, you know.'</p>
<p>Those things! Sell those things! That would be indeed the end
of Claude's life. Not that <i>that</i> would matter much, but it
would be the end also of the Things! They would be sold, would be
broken and ill-treated and soiled. Whereas at his death, if only
he could satisfy his landlord first, there his Things would be on
a table for his friends to choose, and each friend would come
(Claude had long ago made out a list including, I fear, some
<i>very</i> slender acquaintances), regard the Things tenderly,
and, for years after, someone would be saying somewhere: 'Look
out! Don't touch that cup and saucer. That belonged to poor old
Willoughby.' It had indeed become an obsession with him, this
dispersal of his things! He hugged his secret. He had told nobody
save only, one day, little Best--wanting, I'm afraid, to impress
him. And Best had guffawed and chattered and had been, after all,
perhaps awed a bit.</p>
<p>'Not going to kick the bucket yet, old boy?' he had cried.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' said Claude feebly. 'Oh, dear me, no'--although at
times he felt very like 'kicking the bucket'--very like
indeed.</p>
<p>There was no harm in Best; nevertheless Claude wished that he
had not told him. He had sworn Best to secrecy, of course, and
Best had cried: 'Cross my heart, old boy--never tell a soul!'--
and then Best had added: 'Those things--has anyone ever found
them?'</p>
<p>'What things?' asked Claude.</p>
<p>'Why--the things that were stolen.'</p>
<p>'I've heard nothing about them.'</p>
<p>'No. Of course not. Of course not.'</p>
<p>But Brocket thought that Claude had taken them--the bath
salts, the walking-stick, the library books. Brocket, standing in
the doorway, would say one morning:</p>
<p>'See that in the paper? Feller got six months for stealing a
cake of soap. Quite a gentleman too. Been at a public school, the
paper said.'</p>
<p>And with every day Brocket seemed to come physically nearer.
With every day the catastrophe hanging over the world, the
catastrophe prophesied by that terrible little man at the evening
party, seemed to come nearer. The ground did indeed now tremble
under Claude's feet. He had no one to whom he could speak of it.
Even the Pake ladies were now cut off from him, for Helen Pake
was dying: at any moment now she might be gone. The fact was that
Claude was starving. He no longer had breakfast in his room, for
he had not money to pay for it. One meal a day at the little
coffee-house in the Market. Old men of course do not need very
much to eat, nor do they need much sleep. Nevertheless . . .
nevertheless . . .</p>
<p>He had, however, an unconquerable cheerfulness, and this free,
gay splendour of the band delighted him. Music was almost as good
as a meal, and while he listened the ground seemed to steady
itself and this green-golden hazy soil of the Park was firm
beneath him. The people, too, seated in their chairs, standing
when they could not afford the chairs, seemed happy and unafraid.
He was reassured in their company. It was as though they
whispered to him that no ill should come to him while he was in
this company. He looked at them one by one, and--suddenly,
miraculously--close, near to him was the lovely Miss Delaney with
a large handsome woman, undoubtedly Mrs. Delaney herself.</p>
<p>Yes, it was truly Meg standing there, her hand lightly on
Kitty's arm. They had come to take the air and keep up their
spirits by listening to the band. For the Charles Street house
was very silent: Patrick Munden's flat was empty, the Pullet flat
was empty, Helen Pake was dying. Things were nearly as bad as
they could be. The battle for the life of the house was in fact
at its height, and only that morning Frank Frobisher, head
pontiff of Gay and Tallent's, had been shut up with Fred for more
than two hours offering him money so that the Charles Street
house might be pulled down.</p>
<p>'You can't, my dear boy, stick to it,' Frobisher had been
saying. 'You were lucky to have the place filled so long. It has
after all been only a makeshift. Have you <i>seen</i> these
modern flats? Every possible contrivance. Why, you haven't even
central heating. And by the way no one else is going to offer you
half the price we're suggesting. Even if you refuse you're safe
only for a year or two. Look at the way the district's changing.
The Market will be gone in another three years.'</p>
<p>Fred had come from that interview straight into Meg's arms.
The two of them had clung together like a couple of babies.</p>
<p>'Of course,' Fred said, 'he's telling lies about Charles
Street. Even if they do build a flat or two . . . But it's the
money, Meg. Where are we to get the money?'</p>
<p>'Tenants!' Meg cried, as though she were Queen Elizabeth
mustering her forces. 'Tenants! That's what we've got to
find.'</p>
<p>Nevertheless she knew, and they all knew, that they must
summon all their cheerfulness. It was for Fred's sake that they
needed it, for between Fred and the house there was something
deep and poignant. Take the house away and you take some of
Fred's spirit with it. 'He'll never,' Meg thought, 'be quite the
same again, and the Alice Van Renns of this world will multiply.
. . . We must all save Fred. We must love him and cheer him and
console him without his knowing that we are doing anything of the
kind.'</p>
<p>So they came out to take the air and listen to the band.
'Tum-te-ta . . . tum-te-ta . . .' hummed Meg--and then she saw
Claude. As her eyes rested on him so also did Kitty's.</p>
<p>'Why,' Kitty cried, 'that's my nice Shepherd Market man. I
told you about him. His name is Claude something. I can only
think of him as Claude . . . oh yes, Willoughby. Claude
Willoughby. Bullock knows him. He comes to see the Pakes. He's
all by himself, Mother. Let's speak to him.'</p>
<p>Kitty was happy. She didn't know why. The grass smelt of
gunpowder and a light haze like sprinkled barley-sugar powdered
the trees. She was happy. She didn't know why. There was no
reason at all except that the band was now playing variations on
the 'Londonderry Air,' the most beautiful tune since the birds
sang, unselfconsciously, in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>But Meg was looking at Claude Willoughby for quite another
reason. She had known instantly that this very thin, shabbily
dressed, wrinkled-browed old gentleman would play an important
part in one of her life's crises. How did she know? What
nonsense! Of course she didn't. Not one of us knows anything at
all. However, this wasn't the first time that Meg had felt such
things. When she was quite a child a fruit-seller in Nice had
sold her green figs and afterwards picked up her purse with five
pounds in it. Hadn't she foretold something of the sort the
moment she looked at him? Again, during the first week of her
honeymoon with Fred, in Venice, an attendant in the Accademia had
looked at her so strangely and the very next day had thrown
himself into the Grand Canal and been drowned. They had told her
when she went three days later to see the Carpaccios again. And
so now. This old man would have something to do with her life. He
stood there like a prophecy while the band played the
'Londonderry Air' and Big Ben boomed like a beetle out of the
very heart of the sky.</p>
<p>They moved up to him.</p>
<p>'Mr. Willoughby, you don't remember me,' said Kitty.</p>
<p>His pleasure was a handsome thing to witness.</p>
<p>'This is my mother.'</p>
<p>'How do you do?' Claude's hand was shaking.</p>
<p>'He looks as though he doesn't have enough to eat,' Meg
thought, and at once her eagerness to help him swallowed up every
other possible notion or idea. The world was blotted out: only
Claude Willoughby, pale and emaciated, existed for her.</p>
<p>'I come to your house quite often,' Claude explained, 'to see
Millie and Helen Pake.' He looked anxious. His brow was
dreadfully wrinkled and his nose longer than ever. 'I fear
Helen--'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Meg gently. 'But she is in no pain. Only lies
there in a dream. The past has been her only reality for a long
time.'</p>
<p>He straightened himself, looked dignified, symbolic,
representing in his person a complete vanished society.</p>
<p>'When you are my age and Lady Helen's the past is all that you
have. The present--oh dear, I'm afraid I dislike the present very
much indeed.'</p>
<p>'There you are!' Meg cried. 'I'm afraid I'm all for the
present: I wouldn't want to live in any time but this one. And
Kitty,' she went on, laughing, 'Kitty thinks only of the future.
Don't you, Kitty? She doesn't know there <i>is</i> a
present.'</p>
<p>'Oh, the future!' Claude said, shaking his head. 'I'm
terrified of the future. We are all to be blown sky-high.
However, I shan't be here. That's one comfort.'</p>
<p>He was cheering up immensely. It needed only that some
pleasant person should be kind to him for Claude to take a very
rosy view. It was as though nowadays he was only one skin thick.
He felt any treatment of himself, even the mildest, as a blow or
a caress. His whole heart went out to this Mrs. Delaney. Her
splendid figure, her dress of rose and grey, her merriness and
vigour and spirit of hospitality--these warmed him like a fire.
But he was afraid that he would lose her. For weeks he had
haunted Charles Street and the doors had been closed, but now
Charles Street had come to him; here it was with this large merry
lady and this lovely girl. Oh, he must keep them for a moment or
two longer! And he did. For the band played 'God Save the King'
and everyone was on the move. They started, the three of them, to
walk back across the Park. What <i>is</i> it, thought Meg, that
makes this old man important to me? It isn't only that I am sure
that he is half-starved and lonely. It is rather that he is going
to do something for <i>me.</i> He is to be my benefactor, not I
his.</p>
<p>They talked about the Green Park.</p>
<p>'You know,' Meg said, 'if I were one of those men in white
hats and white trousers, always drinking whisky in Africa and
longing for home--you're always seeing them in plays--it's the
Green Park I'd be longing for. I'd see the dry grass and the
dirty sheep and the Victoria Memorial and the heavy-leafed trees
and the dogs running like mad, and I'd be so homesick I wouldn't
know what to do.'</p>
<p>Claude agreed, but thought it was cruel to keep dogs in
London.</p>
<p>'My son's got a dachshund,' Meg said. 'And I'm sure he's very
happy.'</p>
<p>'Just fancy!' Claude said, talking to Meg as though he had
known her the whole of his life. 'On this very spot, or
hereabouts, there was a very famous duel fought. I forget the
names, but I never can go past these trees without thinking of
them. One of them, I <i>know,</i> wore mulberry breeches--I know
he did. And the light was so clear--very early morning--no
smoke--and perhaps a cart rumbling up Piccadilly--'</p>
<p>'Was it pistols or swords?'</p>
<p>'I don't know. Swords, I think. A great sensation. People
talked of it for weeks.'</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment. Was he going to faint? What a
horrible idea--now, in front of these new great friends! But the
trees were bowing before him, the path rocking under his feet and
a noise like the hissing of a great kettle in his ear. He had had
for luncheon two fish-cakes in the Shepherd's Pie Café in the
Market. Two fish-cakes were perhaps not enough.</p>
<p>Meg had taken his arm. He saw, out of the rocking, tree-filled
mist, her eyes, large and full of kindness, comforting him.</p>
<p>'Now--let us sit on these chairs for a moment.'</p>
<p>'It's the excitement.' Claude, sitting down, closed his
eyes.</p>
<p>'The excitement?'</p>
<p>'Yes. You'll think me very foolish. But suddenly,
unexpectedly, making new friends. I hope you don't think me
impertinent, but now, at my age--I don't see many new
people--'</p>
<p>He was talking, to beat down the nausea. To be sick in front
of these ladies. How terrible!</p>
<p>'It's natural enough. Why should people bother? But I often
think--if we weren't so frightened of strangers! There must be so
many lonely people in London. Not that I'm lonely really, you
know, but after seventy--of course so many of one's friends are
gone.'</p>
<p>Ah! that was better! Nature was pulling herself straight
again. The golden soil was steady and the dark leaves did not fan
the sky.</p>
<p>Meg's hand was on his.</p>
<p>'You must come and see us in Charles Street. I know you've
been there often, visiting Helen and Millie. But you must come to
see <i>us.</i> Any time you feel like it.'</p>
<p>Meg was thinking: 'He's starved. That's what the trouble is.
It's too late to ask him in to tea. And we're all out to
dinner.'</p>
<p>But Claude, now recovered, was his proud self again.</p>
<p>'Thank you,' he said with great stateliness. 'I shall like
very much to call if I may.'</p>
<p>Kitty said: 'And if you don't come, Mr. Willoughby, <i>I</i>
shall call and fetch <i>you.</i> We shan't let you off.'</p>
<p>But oh no, Claude thought, these charming ladies must never
see my room. It was bad enough Millie Pake coming in and looking
round. But after all Millie is an old friend and she's poor
too.</p>
<p>'I shall come and call. Don't you fear,' he said gaily. He
must show them that he had engagements and friends and everything
he wanted. He despised himself for his recent admission of
loneliness. 'I must be getting back,' he said, rising with
dignity. 'I have an engagement.' They walked along to the Gates.
'When I said that just now about being lonely I was thinking of
others rather than myself. I am really very fortunate at my
age--very fortunate indeed.'</p>
<p>His brow wrinkled more deeply. What if they should expect to
be invited for a cocktail, perhaps, or a glass of sherry? They
seemed to be determined to see him home. Half Moon Street slept
in the evening sun. Fleming's Hotel was newly painted. Two young
men in a silver sports car stared at the two splendid ladies. Meg
went on:</p>
<p>'We'll just come with you into the Market, Mr. Willoughby. We
must see where you live, you know. Before long we may have to
come and beg your hospitality. We may have to sell the Charles
Street house. Oh dear! I hope not! But we've been looking round
for a nice organ to grind; haven't we, Kitty? Although you never
see an organ now, do you? I hope you'll be kind to us when we're
on the street. We shall need friends.'</p>
<p>It was strange to him to hear her talking of poverty when she
looked so fine and strong and rich. But she conveyed to him in
some mysterious way that she would be happy whatever misfortunes
occurred to her, and this gave him a new courage and hope. While
she was there he was protected and secure. They passed beneath
the friendly sign of Miss Bonda.</p>
<p>The Market had surrendered to a golden quiescence. On the
front slab of the fish-shop the stout form of a gentleman in a
bowler hat and shirtsleeves was perched, his hat half tilted,
while beside him was a notice, 'Fish kept fresh inside during hot
weather.' A minute kitten outside the leather-shop played
languidly with the wheel of a bicycle. Ladies in summer clothing
hung out of windows, and a small boy with a minute crimson
watering-can was pretending to spurt water at the black woolly
dog lazing in front of the book-shop. A young policeman with the
earnest gaze of a philosopher said to the seller of carnations,
'Now you know quite well, I won't have flowers sold on the
pavement.' From behind the open door of the news-shop (in whose
window are entrancing little china dogs) came the happy music of
Henry Hall . . . the life of the whole world in miniature played
itself lazily through the dusty gold of the evening light.</p>
<p>'That,' said Claude, rather nervously (for they might insist
on an inspection), 'is where I live.' He pointed to a window. And
then, as in a Goldoni comedy, the figures began to move, for
there was Caesar, turning the corner with a young girl in a
lilac-coloured dress, and there was Mrs. Rudge looking out of
window. And for Claude there was Brocket, moving towards the girl
and stopping, Caesar squaring his shoulders, old Mrs. Rudge
staring, Caesar suddenly catching sight of Meg, the girl turning
and slipping away, Brocket standing, his arms akimbo, the
dance-music saluting them with a quick rush of sound, Meg
exclaiming, 'Why, it's Caesar!'</p>
<p>'Yes, mum. I was only gone a minute to get some air,' and
then, in a whisper of despair to Meg before he hurried back to
Charles Street: 'Mother knows, mum, about my young lady. She's
been carrying on something dreadful.' The man with the
carnations, now that the policeman was gone, hoarsely whispering
to Kitty: 'Beautiful flowers, lady--'alf a crown for the
lot.'</p>
<p>Lastly Brocket, at Claude's elbow now, disregarding the
ladies: 'Wait a minute, Mr. Willoughby. Something's happened at
the house. Half an hour ago. Mr. Best's gone. Heart attack.'
Brocket moved on.</p>
<p>'So that's where you live, Mr. Willoughby,' Meg said
cheerfully. (Poor Caesar! What a lucky thing that they were all
out to-night! He would be so badly upset, poor boy.)</p>
<p>Claude was trembling. He wiped his forehead with his
handkerchief.</p>
<p>'Unfortunate thing. . . . That's the man at our flats who
spoke to me. Poor Best--one of the tenants--died half an hour ago
of a heart attack.'</p>
<p>And without another word, with a funny, stiff little bow, he
left them. He walked, his head up, as though leading an army. He
was thinking: 'Poor Best! Poor fellow!' And once again the ground
shook beneath his feet. Death, tall and very thin, with ears
pricked like a listening hound, was waiting inside the house to
touch him on the arm.</p>
<p>Word was passing round the Market that someone had just
died.</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c302" id="c302">CHAPTER II</a></h1>
<h2>LIFE OF FRED DELANEY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Heat had gone from the Green Park. The trees were turning and,
once and again, a little amber mist of twirling leaves would
trouble the grey sky. The Park lay desolate, the little chairs
unoccupied and the grand avenue from Gates to Memorial occupied
only by hurrying figures too busy for a glance. Only for the dogs
was it the same unaltered Paradise. Now, as ever, they strained
the leash across the Piccadilly traffic, pausing at midway
safety, their tongues out, panting, wild-eyed, at last within the
Gates, looking upwards with frantic appeal for release, then
running, checking at a scent, running again, recovering all the
promises, suspicions, wild hopes, present confirmations they had
left behind them yesterday.</p>
<p>Above them the trees deepen in metallic gold, in paper-thin
russet, while above them again the clouds smoke and tremble and
shred into tatters of ragged grey.</p>
<p>Late in this September Helen Pake died. She was buried in the
country and Millie went to stay with her brother.</p>
<p>The house, then, was empty save for the Delaneys. Patrick
Munden was in Paris and it was said that Dodie Pullet was there
with him. The house was empty and the fantastic, outrageous thing
was that the Delaneys were delighted. Fantastic, outrageous, for
very shortly the Delaneys must starve.</p>
<p>After the 1st of October there would be no more rents coming
in and what would the Delaneys do then? Everywhere, all over
England, for the last twenty years this same absurd catastrophe
had been suddenly breaking into English family lives. The English
middle and upper classes had for generations understood that
starvation was for them a grotesque impossibility. Until the War
of 1914 it had been so. There had always been land, a house with
a garden, a bundle of relations, a fortunate marriage, a vacancy
in a relation's business, a safe investment--and eternal,
affectionate credit from the deserving but keep-him-in-his-place
shopkeeper. Now, in 1934, there was no land, there were no
ready-money relations, no jobs for young men, no obliging
shopkeepers, no friendly overdraft bankers, and always dwindling
diminishing investments. No one was safe, no one was secure, the
pound was worth about thirteen shillings. Gentlemen like Signor
Mussolini and Herr Hitler had apparently no money but got on
splendidly without it; indeed the less they had the more they
spent. This happy behaviour was, however, impossible for English
ladies and gentlemen. 'But we <i>must</i> live!' cried the
English ladies and gentlemen. No one but themselves, alas! saw
the necessity for this. 'But we <i>cannot</i> starve!' they
cried. No one, alas! saw why they should not. Every expedient was
tried; friends were stayed with, bills were not paid, camp was
continually moved, jobs constantly applied for, jobs once
considered too humiliating for words. Lady Constance Belwether
was a housemaid with a wealthy Newcastle family (she called
herself Miss Allen). The Hon. Frederick Cochran was an assistant
in Belfrage's great stores. 'Bunty' Milne was a chauffeur. And
so, of course, all jobs were overcrowded, employers pestered with
incompetents. The pedlars of toys by St. Paul's numbered in their
ranks several members of the British aristocracy.</p>
<p>With every separate family the shock of surprise was equally
staggering and incredible. 'There is not a penny in the bank,
which refuses an overdraft. There is not one single friend or
acquaintance who can help. I am fifty years of age and worth
nothing to anyone. My two dear boys, so handsome, so athletic, so
charming, have been to Harrow and Oxford and are not exceptional
enough to be worth anyone's while. My beautiful daughters can
cook, use a typewriter, know all about dogs and horses. They can
do none of these things, however, as well as thousands of other
young women.'</p>
<p>The Delaneys were happy, healthy, strong, altogether most
excellent people, but not Fred nor Bullock nor Kitty had ever
been trained to compete with the present incredibly efficient
workers of the world. They simply were not worth anyone's pay
anywhere. Such a crisis, so poignant and terrible, should have
filled them with terror and despair. It did nothing of the sort.
'In actual fact,' a cold, cynical observer might have remarked,
'you are, of course, not worrying--for to-morrow you can sell the
house and so assure yourselves against starving for the rest of
your days.'</p>
<p>But the remarkable thing was that, as soon as the house was
empty, the Delaney family loved it twice as much as before, and
vowed that only over their dead bodies should anyone take it from
them. Without a word spoken they banded together and faced the
outside invader. They were constantly wandering up and down the
stairs and in and out of the empty rooms. The house was theirs
again and the house knew it. They made fantastic plans of how
Bullock and Kitty would marry. Bullock should live in the Pake
flat, Kitty in the Pullet. So all would be for ever under one
roof. When children came they would manage somehow. They laughed
and shouted and sang, played ridiculous games of hide-and-seek,
and the house responded, not behaving, as most empty houses do,
like a grumbling and dusty-faced ghost, but rather catching
glints of sunlight and mantling corners and fireplaces with light
and shadow, making friendly gestures with dusk and dawn and the
reflections of the September evening city lights, catching clouds
in the window-panes and letting the wind whisper merrily in the
fireplaces.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the crisis was there and Fred knew it. He had all
kinds of extravagant ideas about jobs. He spoke gaily to all his
friends: 'Here's a poor fellow out of work. Can't you do
something for him?' And everyone clapped him on the shoulder and
promised and, behind his back, said: 'What's Delaney fussing for?
He's only got to sell the house.'</p>
<p>Bullock had written nearly half of his novel but ran round
suggesting himself to people. 'I'll do anything,' he said.
'Anything for a living wage.' He was a jolly little fellow and
everyone liked him, but unfortunately he had no <i>technical</i>
knowledge of anything. He was not a trained journalist; he knew
nothing about mechanics except that he could drive a car. He was
willing and eager and ignorant. All the same he didn't
<i>really</i> worry, for he saw Lizzie every day and his novel
was coming along nicely.</p>
<p>They were, in fact, all of them incapable of worrying. Somehow
they would manage. They would camp in the house, live on apples
and occasional eggs and bacon. They did not, as many of their
contemporaries did, calculate the friends upon whom they could
sponge. Both Bullock and Kitty knew numbers of young men and
women whose lives were simply miraculous, the way that they
invited themselves and stayed on and on, joined unsuspecting
luncheon parties, leftsuddenly so that their drinks had to be
paid for, vanished to the Riviera where they needed only two
suits and a bathing dress, and then, when things were really bad,
surrendered themselves, their souls and bodies, to anyone who
thought them worth buying. The Delaneys were not of <i>that</i>
world nor ever would be.</p>
<p>Fred Delaney had, however, hours of surprising foreboding and
anxiety. He had, for one thing, never loved his family so much as
now, and it was for them rather than for himself that he lay
awake and sighed in his bath and shook his head over his
newspaper. He did not lie awake nor sigh nor shake his head for
very long. The sense of apprehension that had been with him now
for several months could not conquer his natural happiness, his
consciousness of his body and its many delightful activities, his
love for his wife and children, for London and the house, his
lusty desire to possess Alice Van Renn, and the daily excitements
of seeing the shops, the changing trees in the Park, his many
friends, and especially the constant procession of beautiful
women.</p>
<p>His desire for Alice Van Renn seemed only to increase his love
of Meg and of Kitty. Especially he was seeing his daughter just
now in a fresh and wonderful light. She seemed to him radiant and
lovely. Her sweetness, good-temper, unselfishness, all sprang, it
appeared to him, from her now mature virginity. She was something
untouched, with a wonderful spiritual security, and the more he
desired and intended to spend a week-end with Miss Van Renn, the
more he loved Meg because she was his dear friend, companion and
wife, the more he adored his daughter because she was pure and
unassailed and above the vulgar clutch of men like himself.</p>
<p>And so, in the untidy sitting-room that somehow smelt of
chocolate fudge and dried everlastings--the little Half Moon
Street rooms--he told Alice Van Renn. He had been lucky enough to
catch her alone on that last day of September. He was feeling
reckless and so buoyantly conscious of his health, his sexual
energy, his physical challenge to fate, that Alice herself
responded to it.</p>
<p>He knelt beside her, his arms around her, and enjoyed with her
a kiss that was as long and as deep as Besnard's search for
Atlantis.</p>
<p>'And now--which week-end is it going to be?'</p>
<p>'The last one in October.'</p>
<p>He had risen now to his feet, and looking up at him she
stretched out her hands; he bent towards her, she touched his
cheeks, then, sighing, she said:</p>
<p>'Mother has settled it all. . . . I am to marry Monsieur de
Florac.'</p>
<p>'Old--' Fred paused. Little M. de Florac's nickname in the
best male society was a very coarse one. 'But he has only--' He
broke off.</p>
<p>'Yes,' Alice said. 'He is appalling, but it is a very, very
old story. As you know, he is enormously rich, he makes no
marital demands on me, he thinks I will look lovely at the head
of his table at his beautiful château near Blois. He is right. I
shall.'</p>
<p>Fred laughed.</p>
<p>'Strangely enough, although I have been in love with you so
long, I don't know you very well. But I <i>do</i> know you well
enough to be sure that you are not going to marry old--' He broke
off again.</p>
<p>'No. I am not,' Alice answered. 'But mother thinks that I am.
She is determined that I shall. It suits her exactly--plenty of
money, she can be near me always. Moreover, she likes old de
Florac. They murmur obscene jokes together. And because she is
set on this she detests yourself and Bartlett. You are the two
dangers. . . .'</p>
<p>'Myself? Why, I am married and adore my wife. Who could be
safer?'</p>
<p>'Yes, but she's a wise old bird. She knows that you might give
me just enough--what shall I call it?--well, enough anyway to
make old de Florac impossible. She hasn't yet realized that he is
impossible in any case.'</p>
<p>Fred knelt down again. The worn carpet was hard and dusty. He
took her in his arms and then, after hearing the bells of
Atlantis once more, said: 'And Bartlett--my God, what a
fool!'</p>
<p>Alice Van Renn gently kissed his hair, then rose and, looking
out on to the one-legged street singer in Half Moon Street,
said:</p>
<p>'I am a fool too, remember. Monday morning, that last Monday
in October, as we get into the train, you will be saying: "This
woman is duller than an ox." I shan't blame you. It will be true.
I like Bartlett's stupidity.' She swung round, looking at him
with more intensity, a deeper and more genuine feeling than he
had ever seen in her. 'Of <i>you</i> I'm afraid, Fred Delaney. I
<i>might</i> become fond of you. Then, at the very moment when
you realize that flight is the only cure for such boredom, I
might be longing for you to remain. That would hurt, you know.
And ever since mother beat me with a hairbrush because I stole
her sham-pearl necklace--I was five and a bit--I have determined
to avoid pain. Bartlett and I suit one another exactly.'</p>
<p>She came close to him and put both her hands on his
shoulders.</p>
<p>'I am afraid of your high spirits, and although you are kind
you are restless. Your family is the only thing I can imagine
your being faithful to. Where you are concerned I am <i>not</i>
such a fool. Yes, perhaps the week-end will be the greatest
misfortune for me--will spoil hopelessly all the wiser, safer
things.'</p>
<p>Fred's behaviour then was very bad indeed. He was the complete
fool he could often be. Fortunately old Mrs. Van Renn's wrinkled
hand fumbled at the door-knob. When she entered he was throwing
some pennies down to the one-legged street singer.</p>
<p>Her fury at having inadvertently assisted him to be alone with
Alice had its comic aspect, for when she was angry she was
speechless. She could only mutter like an old monkey deprived of
its banana-skin.</p>
<p>He was very charming and very gay and very kind. He was only
at the top stair when he heard her voice, like the scream of a
wounded bird, upbraiding Alice.</p>
<p>He went home through Half Moon Street, past the Christian
Science Church and round the corner, humming a mixture of
<i>Tosca</i> and <i>Butterfly,</i> for his physical being was now
sure of its definite reward. This certainty made him cock of the
walk and also at great ease with himself because one part of
himself was entirely satisfied. This is where men have so marked
an advantage over women, that they lodge their different selves
so easily in quite separate apartments. Women never. Few women
understand this. This non-comprehension makes marriage very
difficult.</p>
<p>So, humming, thinking of those coming last days of October and
of Alice in his arms, he entered his house loving Meg with a new
kind of charity. Because he would be shortly unfaithful to her he
longed to do her every possible kindness.</p>
<p>And there, having tea with Meg, were those tiresome Penders.
He stopped on the threshold, loving, at the sight of Graham's
long, brown, white-haired neck, Meg just a little less. What had
bitten her over this tiresome pair? True that once, years ago,
she had been engaged to Graham Pender, but now, with his white
locks and museum expression, she surely could not be sentimental!
And that, standing there in the doorway, he suddenly saw that she
was, and, himself straight from his visits to Atlantis with Alice
Van Renn, it roused in him an intolerable irritation. For he
intercepted a look between Meg and Pender--on Pender's side a
long dog-like gaze, a devoted
please-take-me-for-a-walk-or-do-anything-you-like-with-me-only-love-me
look, and on Meg's side a tenderness, a sweetness that really
staggered him.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Pender . . . Lady Pender, how do you do?' (But she,
Meg, couldn't really be falling in love with this long-legged
sad-eyed professor? Meg . . .)</p>
<p>'Yes . . . it's quite chilly. . . . Autumn is upon us, I'm
afraid.'</p>
<p>'Here's your tea, Fred. You look quite flushed.'</p>
<p>'Yes. I've been walking all the way from Trafalgar Square. How
are you, Lady Pender?' (What an appalling old scarecrow, and with
that blue thistle sort of thing stuck in her hat!)</p>
<p>Lady Pender moistened her lips with her tongue.</p>
<p>'Not so very well, Mr. Delaney, I fear.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry. What's the trouble?' (There Pender was
again, looking at Meg as though he would like to lay his head in
her broad lap. And Lady Pender had seen it. Her eyes narrowed.
She sipped at her tea, her gaze sharp as a hatpin over the rim of
her cup, as she said:)</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't know. Anno Domini, I expect. We're neither of us
as young as we were, are we, Graham?'</p>
<p>Pender laughed. 'I'm certainly not. One last little fling and
I'm laid on the shelf.'</p>
<p>Fred stood over Meg for another cup of tea, swinging his broad
body a little, straddling his legs as though to show Pender what
a <i>real</i> body was like!</p>
<p>'Oh, surely not, Pender. You've years ahead of you. And what
is the last little fling to be?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't know. . . . Egypt, perhaps. . . . Egypt suits my
wife's health; doesn't it, dear?'</p>
<p>'You know we can't afford it, dear. And what does <i>my</i>
health matter? Talking of which, you look so <i>very</i> well,
Mr. Delaney.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I am. . . . Splendid. Ready for anything.'</p>
<p>'So's Graham really. Aren't you, dear? Men'--Lady Pender
smiled like a coy death-mask--'never grow up.'</p>
<p>Meg smiled in return. 'I'm glad they don't. It's the only
compensation women have--that they don't grow up, I mean.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Lady Pender. 'And it's fun sharing in their games.
Women never know how to play together.'</p>
<p>Fred, who could think of several ladies of his acquaintance
who knew very well, broke in with:</p>
<p>'Been to any of the new plays?'</p>
<p>'Well--it's rather a nuisance from Surbiton. It's so late
getting back.'</p>
<p>'You must come with us one night.' (He was thinking: We shan't
have a bean in the world unless we sell the house.)</p>
<p>'We should love to. Wouldn't we, Graham?'</p>
<p>'Delighted. I do enjoy a good play.'</p>
<p>They got up to go. Lady Pender said:</p>
<p>'Meg finds her way out to Surbiton quite often, but you've
never been, Mr. Delaney. You're too busy, I expect.'</p>
<p>'Busy!' Fred threw his head back and laughed. 'I wish I were.
I'm out of a job, Lady Pender. If you know of anyone who wants a
chauffeur or someone to wait at table . . .'</p>
<p>There was much laughter. They were gone.</p>
<p>Back by the fireplace Meg said:</p>
<p>'Had a good afternoon, darling?'</p>
<p>'Delightful. Splendid walk.' He kissed her. Then, by an
association of ideas, he said: 'By the way, last week-end in
October, I shall be away, going to shoot with a fellow in
Norfolk.'</p>
<p>'That's lucky,' Meg answered. 'I shall be away myself that
same week-end.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later on Fred Delaney walked with his beautiful daughter
across the Green Park. He was dining with two friends at the
Argonauts' Club, and at nine o'clock Bullock was picking him up
there and they were going to pay a call on that funny old
bastard, Lord Ragadoon. Fred, like everyone else, had known the
old ruffian by sight for years and years, but it had been an
immense surprise to him when he heard from Bullock of this queer
friendship.</p>
<p>'But <i>however</i> did you get to know him?'</p>
<p>'We met in the National Gallery. He took a liking to
Lizzie.'</p>
<p>'The National Gallery! Of all places!'</p>
<p>'Yes, and he wants to meet you, Father. He wants you to see
his things.'</p>
<p>'Of course I'll see his things. I believe they're
marvellous.'</p>
<p>So that was what, this evening, he was going to do. Kitty was
bound on some mysterious adventure of her own. He recognized that
something was happening to her, and he was proud, both of her and
himself, as he realized his supreme confidence in her. She was a
child in actual experience, but her spirit was as strong and
shining as a sword-blade.</p>
<p>Poetry was alive in him as, Kitty's arm tucked in his, they
passed through the Gates and started down the Avenue at whose
other end there was a smoky bee-swarm of orange light about the
Memorial, while high in the air above the black tree-tops hung
the silver-illuminated tower. There was a faint crackling spark
of frost in the air.</p>
<p>'Let's walk on the grass, darling. Look out for the chairs.
How the houses shine upon this mysterious place--as though they
were ringing it round with guardianship. Stand still a moment.
Big Ben's striking. You can almost hear the river running under
our feet, and the Piccadilly traffic is like a man strumming on
his guitar before he hits the tune.'</p>
<p>They walked on, body close to body, very happy, very
tranquil-spirited.</p>
<p>'What are you up to, darling? Never mind. Don't tell me. We're
all up to something, your mother as well. . . . What an amorous
place this Park is! So many lives here under the trees coming to
one of their many crises. How can anyone say life is dull, or
even frightening? Because after all it is over so quickly. When
the crash comes, Kitty, when the planes overhead are raining down
their bombs and everyone is cowering below ground, this Park will
wait with silent contempt. Yes, contempt, because it has already
seen so much and <i>will</i> see so much more. The trees will
come crashing down. That illuminated tower will waver in the air,
then crumble. Big Ben will cry its last hour. The river will rise
and flow, the shops will submerge, the sky will be dark with
light shifting smoke. And then, Kitty, there will be <i>such</i>
a silence! Strange birds will fly over and hover on the ruins of
the Ritz. Down Piccadilly will float the blurred soaking canvas
of the "Bacchus and Ariadne" and over Westminster there will hang
the stinking fiery pall from the smouldering Abbey. Round and
round the Poets' Corner the ducks will go squawking. Only the
Victoria Memorial will survive, immune, indestructible, virtuous,
Imperial.'</p>
<p>Kitty laughed and pressed his arm.</p>
<p>'It's lovely to have a real poet in the family,' she said.</p>
<p>They paused near the bandstand and fancied for a moment,
because the shadows beguiled them, that a ghostly orchestra was
at play. Very faintly Cavaradossi with his absurdly unreal canvas
and elegant painter's blouse rose before the marble pillars of
the Roman church. It was a huddle of sheep, moving into the light
from the near-by houses, drifting along like the ghosts of
Caesar's murderers. A cry of some bird cut the beautiful
stillness.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Fred Delaney. 'It's a darling Park, a
<i>darling</i> Park. My ghost will join all the other ghosts, and
we'll go wandering, wandering, seeking our favourite little
chairs and the young typist with the china-blue eyes against
whose warm body we lay when the sun parched the grass, or looking
perhaps up and down the paths for the cigar-ends and the cast-off
sandwich and, who knows, a dropped enchanting sixpence!' He swung
his umbrella round and round. 'I love to be alone with you,
Kitty, just the two of us. You're a darling child, a
<i>darling</i> child. . . . And now I suppose my time with you is
short. Soon a man will take you away. I shall see you once and
again and then I shall be a grandfather, and the day after that,
who knows?--a great-grandfather, for I feel to-night as though I
am going to live for ever, perched, like an old stork, on one
leg, surveying the ruined world and hiding your babies under the
shadow of my wing.'</p>
<p>'I don't suppose I shall ever marry,' Kitty said.</p>
<p>'Never marry? Why, of course you will! I thought you were
engaging in a love affair at this very minute.'</p>
<p>'Oh no . . . I'm only perceiving a number of things quite for
the first time.'</p>
<p>There occurred then one of those coincidences that God allows
Himself once and again when He is too lazy to invent something
more likely.</p>
<p>Out from the shadows there emerged upon the light circle of
grass two persons. Bodies almost collided. There was a pause, a
stare. Kitty gave a little cry. The young man, who was Alton
Foster, raised his hat.</p>
<p>He stopped as though he would speak, but the stout lady
hanging on his arm urged him forward. Kitty heard her say in a
voice as odious and monotonous as a bath-water tap: 'People you
know, darling?'</p>
<p>The woman was wearing red and green, was handsome in a kind of
florid extravagance, very full-breasted. She was hanging on
Alton's arm. She was years older. Alton had run from the
thunderstorm across this Park crying: 'I'll prove myself. . . .
You'll see . . . You'll see . . .'</p>
<p>They were turning along the Mall, up the Duke of York's steps,
and so immediately to Carlton House Terrace and the Argonauts.
Fred, intent on his own flood of oratory, had not even noticed
the pair.</p>
<p>'What a horrid vulgar woman!' Kitty said, five minutes after
they had encountered them.</p>
<p>'Where, dear?'</p>
<p>'Oh, gone--long ago--nobody.' (Over the jewels in Zanti's shop
the young, pale, eager face hangs. 'I must see you . . . I
<i>must</i> . . . I must!')</p>
<p>Fred was happily talking.</p>
<p>'Don't think it fantastic, darling. Or you can if you like.
Life <i>is</i> fantastic. But I feel that if we let this house
go, everything goes. Everything for us, I mean. You see, I think
we're so happy because we have the luck tomake a perfect
combination, the house and our four selves. It happens sometimes.
Once and again you meet absolutely joyful people, <i>real</i>
joy, independent of circumstances. And it's always because they
are fortunate enough to have made a perfect union with something
or someone. You see it in married people, in friends, in brother
and sister, in two brothers, in an organization, in a saint. I
believe that's the point of life--to find the thing or person or
persons that will prevent you living for yourself alone. And
there's a power--an evil power if you like--that will upset that
combination if it can. It's always at work, doing its best to
destroy, to tear things and people apart. I believe it's at work
on us now, darling, trying to take the house from us, to take us
from one another. It's nonsense to say there isn't free will. Of
<i>course</i> there is. Plenty of it. We're all being tempted at
this moment, all four of us, and if we yield or lose the house
we'll never come together again--never, never. Never as we are
now, joyful and free. Joyful and free! Tum-te-tum-te-tum. The
Evil One is at our throats. The fight is on. United we stand,
divided we bloody well fall. We fall and are never put together
again. Lost for ever. We groan, scramble in the dark, curse the
Deity. But it isn't the Deity. It is ourselves. We've yielded to
our snorty, greedy, guzzling, pig-troughing selves, and so we're
lost, separated for ever. Our joy is over, our laughter silenced,
our . . .'</p>
<p>'Hush, darling. You are making a terrible noise. Of course we
won't let the house go.'</p>
<p>'No, we won't--but perhaps we will. Who can tell where the
victory's going? What do you think your mother's up to?'</p>
<p>'Mother?'</p>
<p>'Yes. She's up to something. Didn't you know? Perhaps it's
<i>she</i> who'll lose the battle for us. Or perhaps it is
I--just for an ankle and the white curve of a shoulder. Ashes and
worms. Worms and ashes. Or perhaps it's <i>you.</i> For we're all
in it together. What is it <i>you're</i> up to, darling?'</p>
<p>'I?' Kitty pressed his arm and looked so lovely and so kind
glancing up at him in the lamplight that he had lightly to kiss
her forehead and so disturb a young straight-from-the-egg-Hendon
policeman who blushed and looked passionately down the Mall. 'I'm
up to nothing. Nothing whatever. If you'd noticed that vulgar
woman in red and green you'd have known why.'</p>
<p>'Would I? How mysterious you are! Well, try and behave well in
the next week or two. It's like the fairy stories. You're not to
ask the Princess who she <i>really</i> is until the cock crows. .
. . Lord, I'm weak. Weak as water. It's I who will ruin the lot
of us, separate us and destroy us. God forgive me. God pardon me.
Here we are. Up the steps. Into the decorous. Straight to the
mausoleum of respectability. Good night, sweetheart. . . . Good
night, good night.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Bullock, looking very babyish in a bowler hat cocked to
one side of his head, called for him he had drunk enough to be
quite sober and sensible. He stood for a moment, admiring his
son's sturdy little frame. 'I have indeed two of the
<i>sweetest</i> children in all the world,' and then, stamping on
his sentimentality, scolded Bullock all the way up Lower Regent
Street for wearing a bowler hat.</p>
<p>'They are altogether out of fashion. You look like a
travelling salesman.'</p>
<p>'I wish I were,' Bullock said. 'Father, I <i>must</i> get a
job somewhere. It's disgraceful. It seems I'm no good at
anything.'</p>
<p>'Myself likewise,' said Fred.</p>
<p>'Yes, but you're of an age and I'm just beginning. Lizzie
agrees with me that somehow I've got to save the family.'</p>
<p>'What about your novel? Won't that bring you a heap of
money?'</p>
<p>'I don't know. For one thing, it isn't finished. For another,
writing never seems as good the day after as it does the day
before, if you understand what I mean.'</p>
<p>But Fred was worrying about the house again.</p>
<p>'Of course we could mortgage. But that would be just the same
as selling it. I could <i>borrow</i> money on it, but that would
be selling it again. No, we <i>must</i> find tenants or jobs.
Jobs or tenants. You see, Bullock, I can't think of
<i>anything</i> I can do. I'm too old and too heavy to be a
gigolo, too fond of liquor to be a butler, too fond of your
mother to be away from the house. I might help my brother sell
things. I can be charming when I like. But I don't know the value
of anything. I could cheat people, I suppose, in one way or
another. There are all <i>sorts</i> of ways, I believe--but I'm
not really bad enough. I don't like hurting people. Neither does
your mother. That's one of our weaknesses in this hard,
relentless world.'</p>
<p>'Never mind,' said Bullock consolingly. 'We'll live on eggs
and cook them ourselves.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but you have to <i>buy</i> the eggs. And then there are
rates and light and coal and clothes and soap.'</p>
<p>'Soap's <i>very</i> cheap.'</p>
<p>'Yes, but the water has to be hot and your Mother and Kitty
have <i>got</i> to look handsome. You're beginning to look shabby
already with that bowler hat.'</p>
<p>'Here we are,' said Bullock. 'Take care you don't stub your
toes on the staircase.'</p>
<p>They had pushed a bell in the old dingy house and the door had
silently opened. After three flights of stairs that smelt of mice
and cheese there was old Ragadoon standing on the landing
awaiting them. He had a tartan shawl over his shoulders, a shabby
pair of blue trousers and large, soft grey slippers. He was
smoking a pipe.</p>
<p>'This is my father,' Bullock said.</p>
<p>Ragadoon grunted, shook hands, motioned them into the room.
There were three rooms, one a sitting-room, one a bedroom, and
one a storeroom. There was also a little bathroom. There was a
kettle on the fire. The room was infernally hot. In the course of
the next hour and a half Fred saw many miraculous things. The
walls were a dusty faded red, a saffron yellow, a dirty grey, and
on these walls hung incredible masterpieces. Over the bed was a
Giovanni Bellini, a landscape with a charming girl Madonna and a
fat kicking Bambino. Over the wash-stand, hanging crooked on its
wire, was a Rembrandt--'Susanna and the Elders.' Over the
mantelpiece was a Lorenzo di Credi--an Italian landscape with
figures. Every inch of every wall was plastered with oils and
drawings: drawings by Leonardo, Rembrandt, Titian, Tiepolo,
Greco; there were Byzantine ikons, a triptych by Lorenzo
Veneziano. There were cases packed with drawings and etchings. In
the small and dirty bathroom were a number of Hogarths and
Rowlandsons, coarse and vigorous and merry. They didn't talk very
much. Ragadoon shuffled about, puffing at his pipe, muttering:
'Look at this. Fine, isn't it? What do you say to this? Here's a
Degas worth looking at. Beautiful Longhis, aren't they? Genuine
too. Only one Longhi in ten is to-day. Tell me when you've had
enough.'</p>
<p>But Fred Delaney never had enough. He had no connoisseur's
knowledge of painting, but he didn't pretend to have. He did what
any collector loves to have his visitor do--showed, by the light
in his eyes and the smile on his lips, that he was
heavenly-happy.</p>
<p>It was indeed the perfect end to a perfect day. Ragadoon and
he liked one another.</p>
<p>'Have some tea,' said Ragadoon. 'The kettle's boiling.'</p>
<p>'No, thanks,' said Fred. 'I've got to get back. Doesn't anyone
look after you here?'</p>
<p>'I have a man,' Ragadoon said grimly. 'I hate him so much that
he's now out somewhere getting drunk. A char comes mornings.'</p>
<p>He patted Bullock on the shoulder.</p>
<p>'I like your boy. He's got a good girl too. Well, good-day to
ye, if you must go. Come again.'</p>
<p>In the street Fred Delaney said, 'Glory be to God!'</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>THE THINGS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Park threw poor Claude out of its misty securities as Big
Ben struck five. He was so sharply sensitive now to every kind of
rebuff that he was well aware when the Park had had enough of
him.</p>
<p>It had been an afternoon of thin floating mist with a smell of
bacon and fried sausage in the air. That at least was how Claude
had felt it, for he was in a state of perpetual hunger. Also the
sun had looked, through the mist, like a large poached egg, and
rather foolishly he had stood on the damp grass watching it
descend behind the trees and fancying that it came swimming
towards him, and a gigantic footman handed it on a piece of toast
made out of a brown sun-edged cloud that was hanging over the
Memorial. 'Here you are, sir!' said the Celestial Footman, and
didn't Claude tuck in! Then--plop!--the sun had gone and the Park
turned distinctly nasty. The trees flung their leaves at him, the
mist came sweeping like damp dishcloths flicking his face, and
the houses closed in. Very nasty the Green Park can be! You can
hear the underground stream running, and eyes, that may be lamps
or may not, look from between the trees, and the long avenue is
like the one Lady Dedlock once hurried down to poor Mr.
Tulkinghorn's ultimate disadvantage.</p>
<p>But no, the Green Park never has anything to do with the
country, and especially in autumn and winter it is urban. Claude
knows now, as he hurries through the Gates, that messages are
pouring into the Park from little streets that smell of beer and
strong tobacco, from rooms up three flights of stairs with unmade
beds in them and tradesmen's calendars crooked on the wall and
soot falling down the chimney, and dark corners with some
property-for-sale notice and an iron urinal and a tobacco-shop
with coarse postcards--and all the cheap cinemas and all the
dart-boards in all the pubs, and all the area steps with all the
cats, and all the broad thoroughfares with the motor-cars panting
and the changing lights, and all the City churchyards with the
mist groping over the forgotten graves, and all the 'meat with
two veg. shops' with their cubicles and steaming hot cups of
coffee, and all the pedlars in Holborn winding up their dancing
bears and jumping niggers and little men turning somersaults, and
all the old curiosity shops with netsukes and 'oil-painting of
Lady Hamilton' and chessmen of ivory, and bronze images of 'The
Dying Gladiator,' and all the men and all the women and all the
scarecrows and all the policemen and all the ladies of the
Town--the Green Park is aware of them all and is busy collecting
messages and sending them out again. For here is the very heart
of London, and under the thin grass, if you put your ear to the
ground, you can hear the heart beating.</p>
<p>One more flap of the dishcloth mist and Claude is gone,
hastening, as though the assassin is at his heels, across
Piccadilly, down Half Moon Street, under the arch into the
Market, through the door and up the stairs, into his room where
his Things are waiting for him, his only friends, his only
comfort, his only security against the enemy.</p>
<p>He took off his coat, put on his dressing-gown, brushed his
hair, washed his hands. Then opened the glass doors of the
cabinet so that he could see the better. Then found his faded old
writing-case, opened it and drew from it two sheets of paper. At
the head of the first of these he had written (the first letter
of each word in red ink)--</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center"><font style="color:red">G</font>IFTS
<font style="color:red">F</font>OR <font style=
"color:red">M</font>Y <font style="color:red">F</font>RIENDS</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the title it was stated:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>After my decease I wish the undermentioned persons to
be notified that, in gratitude for their good-will towards me, I
would wish them to have some little possession of mine in memory
of me. Therefore on a certain day to be named by those in charge
of my affairs they will, I hope, come and choose something as a
gift from me.</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>It had taken him much time and trouble to make this statement.
He had written it again and again, loving indeed the labour that
he had expended over it. Now, reading it over, he disliked the
ambiguity of 'they will, I hope, come,' etc. Did not that mean
that the persons 'in charge of his affairs' should come? That was
not at all what he intended. He was, in fact, very uncertain as
to the names of 'those in charge.' The natural thing would be to
appoint an executor, but that would surely be very ridiculous in
the case of someone whose 'leavings' were so very slender. There
might indeed be no 'leavings' at all unless in some fashion he
managed to pay Brocket his rent. Plans for doing this now
obsessed him night and day. It was of this he had been thinking
in the Park, and it was there that it had suddenly come to him
that he would go to that delightful lady in Charles Street who
had been so very friendly to him, and explain to her the whole
affair. He would tell her that except for the things named on
this second sheet of paper everything must be sold--his
furniture, clothes, everything. This would not amount to a great
sale, but it would be sufficient, he thought, tocover the rent.
Then he would ask her, as a great favour, to see that his list of
bequests was not interfered with. He would explain to her that
this little scheme of his was now the only wish he had on earth.
He would not tell her (what secretly he confessed to himself)
that his great pride in it rose from its novelty. It was NEW. No
one, he had by this time persuaded himself, had ever done it
before; no one, in the wide world, had ever thought of it before
himself. People would say: 'Well, he's gone. Not an ordinary man
really. That was a charming thought of his,' and for years after
they would remember him for his lovely little idea. This was not,
of course, his <i>only</i> motive.</p>
<p>He had been always a sentimental, idealistic lover of his
kind, longing for love in return. But, in that strange misty
confusion of old age, solitude, poverty and hunger, his plan had
grown beyond all its natural absolute bounds into a sort of
fantastic poetic creation. Something <i>new</i> in the world like
the <i>Odyssey</i> or the <i>Eroica. . .</i> .</p>
<p>He surveyed his list of friends. He had calculated that in all
there were nineteen Things and he had put on to paper twenty-two
friends. But of five of these he was not certain. They might be
dead; he could not be sure. He had had some difficulty in
summoning twenty-two friends, and, if the truth were known, they
were not all very <i>great</i> friends. He did not, for example,
know <i>Mr.</i> Delaney at all, but he thought that it would seem
invidious indeed to include his wife and children and leave him
out of it. One name troubled him considerably--Mr. Walter
Cavendish. Walter Cavendish was a young man, son of his old
friend Colonel Bertie Cavendish, some time deceased. He had known
Walter only as a very small boy, quite a baby in fact, when in
the enchanted days before the War he had gone to stay with Bertie
at his place in Somerset. (Walter Cavendish must be now forty if
a day, but Claude saw him still as a baby rolling under the table
and crying because he had bumped his head against the table-leg.)
Claude did know, however, that Walter was now gossip-writer for
the <i>Daily Globe.</i> He detested gossip-writers, but when he
could afford it purchased the <i>Daily Globe</i> just to see what
his old friend's boy was saying. Now, quite frankly, he invited
young Walter because he hoped that he might say a word or two in
his column. This was disgraceful and pandering to all the vilest
tendencies of this modern world. But he could not help himself.
This one concession to vulgarity he must be allowed: and, after
all, he had once given Walter Cavendish a rocking-horse.</p>
<p>His brow corrugated with the most serious attention, he went
once more through the list of his friends. <i>Was</i> Charlie
Knight alive? Hadn't 'Buzzard' Taylor gone to South Africa years
ago? So, his pencil poised, looking about the room, he saw what
he had failed to notice when he came in, two letters on his
table. <i>Two</i> letters! Most unusual! The first was an ironic
missive, an intimation from a fashionable tailor in Burlington
Street that he had in his possession at this moment a most
remarkable stock of suitings, etc. etc. He opened the other. It
contained a card with black edges, and on the card he read that,
Mr. Frederick Best having expressed, before his decease, a wish
that he might show in some fashion his gratitude for the
good-will that his friends had, for so many years, shown towards
him, he had thought to manifest his thankfulness by arranging a
collection of small possessions dear to him. This collection
would be at the service of those same friends. These were
invited, on October 5th instant, to attend at No. 23 White Horse
Street, between the hours of 2.30 and 5 p.m., that they might
choose some small thing for themselves and keep it as a memory of
him.</p>
<p>Claude read this three times through. The third time he read
it aloud as though the words were so incredible that he must test
their truth by sounding them. Then the card dropped from his
hands and he sat staring in front of him.</p>
<p>His first violent emotion was of hatred and detestation of
Best. In his bewildered fancy it seemed to him that Best was
standing in front of him. Best, short, stumpy-legged, red of
face, blue of eye, wearing his Club tie and canary-coloured
waistcoat. Best was grinning at him malevolently.</p>
<p>'You've betrayed me, basely, cruelly, wickedly!'</p>
<p>'Well, you silly old fool, what did you tell me for? I thought
it a damned good idea. I had as much right to it as you.'</p>
<p>'You had not! You had not! It was <i>my</i> idea!'</p>
<p>'Pooh--<i>your</i> idea. Your little idea. It's nothing at
all. Why do you get so excited about it? You'd think you'd
discovered the North Pole.'</p>
<p>'It's all I had. It was my one comfort. You promised you'd
tell nobody.'</p>
<p>'How could I tell you'd take it so seriously? You always were
an old woman. Many a laugh Badget and I've had . . .'</p>
<p>Yes, that was the way Best would talk were he alive. But he
was not. He was dead. When Claude had first heard of Best's
sudden death he had been most genuinely sorry. He had never liked
Best and he was sure that Best had suspected him of stealing
those things, but there was something infinitely pathetic in the
sudden taking-off of a man who had been so sure of his own
health. He could hear Best saying to Badget: 'In the pink of
condition, old man. You should see me, stripped to the buff,
doing my morning exercises! Never dream I was fifty-eight!' And
there he was, gone in a moment! Poor old Best! An awful bore, but
he meant well, his heart was kind!</p>
<p>Meant well? His heart was kind? He meant ill. His heart was
devilish, as were the hearts of all men in this foul, dangerous,
malevolent world! With shaking hands Claude tore up the two
sheets of paper. They lay in fragments about the table.</p>
<p>Then his ferocity changed to a dismal, miserable dejection.
After all it had been his own fault. He had told Best and Best
had thought it a good idea. Best with his light mind and gay
loquacious character could not understand how much it would mean
to Claude. And, after all, had it not been a kind of madness? Was
not Claude perhaps going a little crazy in his loneliness? At
this thought Claude began to tremble, his head to shake, his legs
to quiver. For suppose they really did think him mad, and
Brocket, with his malicious wickedness, complained to the
authorities and they shut him up? This horrible thought made him
cry out aloud and soon he was walking about his little room
calling: 'No. No. They can't do that. They can't do that.'</p>
<p>Then, so doing, his eyes fell on the Things and he was filled
with a sentimental pity for them. They must share in his own
disappointment, for it would have been a glorious future for
them, and now, when he was gone, they would have no future.</p>
<p>After all he could make a will and leave them, each by name,
to a friend. But that would not be at all the same thing. They
were too small, too unimportant to be left severally in a will.
And how could he make a will when he had nothing to leave but
these? He would not confess to himself that what he had wanted to
do was to make a little show, to assert himself, even for a
moment, before the callous, ungrateful world. And it had been not
only his personal vanity, but also a desire for the glory of the
Things themselves. He had seen them all set out on the table, and
friends regarding them with loving admiration. . . . Oh, well, it
had been a childish, senile notion, something that only an old
man, very lonely, could conceive. Best had taken it from him. He
was welcome to it.</p>
<p>But now there was nothing left. He sat down and stared in
front of him. There was nothing left at all, except the unpaid
rent, and Brocket was drawing closer and closer. . . . He blew
his nose. He went to the cabinet and closed the doors. The room
now was growing very dark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He told himself that he would not go. Of course he went. It
was half-past three of a stormy, yellow-faced afternoon. In
Best's dining-room the electric light blazed down upon a strange,
struggling, noisy crowd.</p>
<p>At the door stood a sleepy-eyed housemaid who received the
cards from the invited. At the far corner near the sideboard on
which drinks were arranged stood Brocket in a shabby blue suit
directing a fat boy with his tie above his collar to serve
everyone with cocktails and sandwiches. The crowd seemed large
because the dining-room table on which the gifts were arranged
took up so much of the room; nevertheless Best's executors had
most certainly invited too <i>many</i> friends. It seemed to
Claude, as he stood just inside the door, that they surged round
the table like animals, talking, laughing, pushing. Constantly
someone made a stretch with an arm towards the table. A
lady--there were many ladies--cried out: 'That's mine. Most
certainly that's mine.'</p>
<p>When Claude, moving a little closer, saw the table and its
contents, any resentment against poor Best instantly died. For
they were extremely pathetic. Claude (for he was tall) beheld a
pencil, a ruler and an indiarubber, a plate with the arms of
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a volume of poems by Lindsay Gordon
(shabby this), a photograph of the donor in flannels holding a
cricket-bat, a green inkbottle in the shape of a negro's head,
two blue vases stamped with red flowers, a copy of <i>Decline and
Fall</i> by Evelyn Waugh, a copy of <i>Sorrell and Son</i> by
Warwick Deeping, a photograph in a gilt frame of the Victoria
Falls, a blotter of purple leather, a water-colour of sea coming
in under a large yellow and inquisitive-looking moon, a
cigar-case, a pair of silver cuff-links . . . these things he
saw. There were others.</p>
<p>He was aware of a curious trait in the human character. He
felt it rising in himself. Nothing so far as he could see on the
table was of any value at all, and yet so strong is the passion
in the human breast for obtaining something for nothing that the
crowd around the table was beginning to be very troublesome.</p>
<p>When he first came in it seemed that everyone was politely
social. Glasses were held in the air, sandwiches nibbled, affairs
of the day discussed. Oh, wasn't it splendid about Prince George
and Princess Marina! Would it be a really Royal Wedding, one of
those <i>grand</i> affairs, nothing hole-and-corner? Yes, and
wasn't she truly lovely? Yes, again and again, and wasn't poor
Noel Coward's misadventure in Corsica too unfortunate? He had
lost fourteen suits of clothes--and Ivor Novello--not very good,
<i>Murder in Mayfair,</i> do you think? But <i>The Shining
Hour.</i> You should see how naturally Raymond Massey plays the
piano when all the time his barn is burning over his head! Dated!
Dated! Even as the words rise and fall in the air Time is
passing. In another moment it will be another play, another
actor, another marriage, another music . . . but <i>not</i> yet
is there any period to that sudden cry (for the Ice Age Man cried
it) 'It's mine! I saw it first!'--and at that shrill voice social
amenities are forgotten, there is a surge towards the table.
'Doesn't look bad, that razor-strop and blade,' a long thin man,
craning his neck beside Claude, murmured. 'If I could only get to
the table, blast it.'</p>
<p>A stout lady in bright blue, pushing with her arms right and
left, broke right through to the table. She stretched her fat arm
and secured a bronze copy of Hercules strangling a serpent. She
held it aloft and cried: 'Fred always wanted me to have this. He
said so again and again. It was always on his writing-table and
he knew I admired it.'</p>
<p>'If you <i>don't</i> mind,' one furious gentleman said to
another. 'If you'd kindly keep your arm out of my stomach . .
.'</p>
<p>Then someone laughed and then everyone began to roar with
laughter. It became, in a moment, the jolliest affair possible.
Everyone shoved together. There were screams and cries and
triumphant 'I've got it,' and 'Look out--that's mine!' but no
hostility now; just a jolly friendly scramble.</p>
<p>And Claude joined in too. He found himself, with arms and legs
and shoulders and chests and bosoms, struggling, pushing, until
at last he was beside the table, had snatched at a hideous little
ash-tray in beaten metal, had triumphantly, his tie hanging out
over his waistcoat, secured it!</p>
<p>In the twinkling of Brocket's eye the whole table was cleared.
Not a thing remained. Every face was flushed with pleasure,
cocktails were demanded. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Claude, in his room, opened his cabinet, took out the Things
one after another, dusted each one with his handkerchief. . .
.</p>
<p>The cabinet closed, he sat down and gazed at it. For the first
time that day a gratified, benignant smile stole across his thin
anxious countenance. His things were safe!</p>
<p>That was, however, a brief moment of respite. The wheezy
asthmatical clock on the stairs had struck nine-thirty. Claude's
room was dark save for the reflection that always came from the
lamp below in the Market. This reflection was like an old
gentleman with a hooked nose. If the curtains were not drawn it
settled itself, like one of the grotesques of Leonardo, on the
faded wallpaper, and there it clung--an old gentleman with hooked
nose and protruding chin and out of his left ear a banner of
wavering light. . . .</p>
<p>Claude lay back in his chair, his mouth open, a thin whistling
noise from between his lips, and on his fallen eyelids that damp
sheen that seems to speak of infinite weariness. The old
gentleman's head on the wall becked and nodded. Up from the
Market came faintly the sound of someone blowing a horn.</p>
<p>Brocket stood there, watching. He was in an evil temper. The
girl he had marked as his own resisted impertinently, said she
was engaged to a boy who worked in Charles Street. A set of rooms
was vacant and he did not know how long it might be before he
found a tenant. And he had scooped in no profits from Mr. Best.
That mangy sister of his, Mrs. Fotheringay, and his
brother-in-law, Major Fotheringay, they had stood like gaolers
over Mr. Best's effects. He'd give them gaolers!</p>
<p>And now he was looking at the sleeping Mr. Willoughby with
absolute loathing and with a virtuous sadism too. Cruelty has its
own foundation of morality. Brocket felt a very genuine disgust
at this old sleep-whistling failure. And he felt his own virtuous
power. One word from him, one lift of the finger, and the old man
would leap from his slumber, his eyes would stare with
half-awakened terror. He would stare like an old madman. Well,
perhaps he was by now a madman--half out of his wits--ought to be
put away by the authorities. That was a new idea.</p>
<p>'Mr. Willoughby! Mr. Willoughby!' he said softly. He stood
with his belly jutting out from the wall, his head a little
forward. 'Mr. Willoughby!'</p>
<p>Claude had been standing before the long windows of a glorious
room, a room hung with tapestries with a painted ceiling of
nymphs and cupids. Breakfast was just over. They were going for a
ride. You could hear the horses now on the gravel. . . . 'Mr.
Willoughby!' Claude opened his eyes and saw the shabby room
veiled in a sort of smoky dusk, the reflection stirring like
water on the wall, and then Brocket's belly and the dark form of
his thick body in the half-light.</p>
<p>'Mr. Willoughby!'</p>
<p>'Well. . . . What is it?'</p>
<p>'I came to see if you were all right. I was on the stairs and
you were crying out.' (He was not, but that didn't matter.)</p>
<p>'I was asleep. . . .' Claude sat up. 'All right. What are you
standing there for?'</p>
<p>'Are you quite well? You haven't been looking yourself.'</p>
<p>'Of course I'm quite well. What business is it of yours?'</p>
<p>'Oh, nothing.' Brocket came forward and bent a little as
though he would see clearly into Claude's face. 'Bit peculiar
you've been behaving. Don't know it yourself, I expect.'</p>
<p>Claude sat back in the chair. 'Don't come near me. You know I
can't bear it.'</p>
<p>'No--and that's another peculiar thing. If you told someone
about it they'd think it <i>very</i> peculiar.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean--told someone?'</p>
<p>'Oh, well--I have to see everything's right with my tenants,
you know. The authorities trust me for that.'</p>
<p>'But of course I'm all right. There's nothing peculiar in not
wanting to be touched by <i>you</i>!'</p>
<p>'Now that's rude, Mr. Willoughby, positively rude. But you
<i>have</i> been talking wild lately. Several people have noticed
it. Very wild at times. And the way you have of talking to
yourself. . . . Well, well . . . good night. Good night.'</p>

<h1><a name="c304" id="c304">CHAPTER IV</a></h1>
<h2>BULLOCK AND KITTY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Park has seen so many lovers in its time that it cannot be
expected to pay any very particular attention to Bullock and
Lizzie seated on two little chairs on a late October afternoon.
It is, however, a scientific fact, and not merely a sentimental
whimsy, that lovers are always assured that clouds, grass,
flashes of sunlight, sudden storms and dust blowing in the eyes
have their origin in the emotions of the heart.</p>
<p>Little Bullock Delaney was never an idle sentimentalist, but
he was convinced on this especial afternoon that the thin October
sun, the faint scent of chrysanthemums from somewhere or other,
the idle, twirling fall of an orange-amber leaf or two--these
things were beautifully operating because he loved Lizzie
Coventry so very dearly.</p>
<p>No relation between any two human beings ever stands still.
Bullock and Lizzie were not where they had been even a month ago.
The great change had occurred during a railway journey from
London to Yarmouth. One fine morning they suddenly thought that
they would pay Yarmouth a visit. Lizzie, to whom Dickens was one
of the few delightful English novelists, wished to salute the
ghosts of the Peggottys. Bullock, monstrously extravagant, bought
first-class tickets, and they were, throughout the journey, alone
in their compartment.</p>
<p>Bullock lay with his head in Lizzie's lap and her thin hand
was on his breast. The morning was exquisite and beautifully
silent. They talked very little. As is the way in life, there
occurred for Bullock one of those moments of perfect experience
when life seems to say: 'For this hour I have decided to deprive
myself of all the irritations, disappointments, colds, malaises,
bad tempers and incongruities with which it generally amuses me
to cloud the scene. For once (and I may never be in the mood
again) I allow you to look right through into the clarity of
absolute experience. This is what I <i>really</i> am; it wouldn't
be good for you to see me like this very often. Moreover it would
be very dull for <i>me</i>.'</p>
<p>Lizzie said once, as though to herself: 'Yes--I know now that
I love you, Bullock dear.'</p>
<p>Yarmouth, afterwards, was good enough and they had great fun;
on the journey back Lizzie slept, her head on Bullock's shoulder.
But it was the journey <i>thither</i> that had this great quality
of perfection.</p>
<p>She trusted him now entirely and, in many ways, this made
things more difficult for him. In years she was still a child,
but she had, he now knew, a deep horror of all sexual experience.
She might have this always. As a baby she had witnessed the naked
wranglings, infidelities, cruelties of mature men and women. As a
little child she had heard and seen terrible things. She had
saved herself only by a savage and determined resolve to protect
herself always from all physical experience. Two persons only in
her life, her Aunt Fanny and her cousin Edward, had won her
trust. Now a third, Bullock, and possibly Bullock's mother.</p>
<p>Bullock knew well that at the slightest evidence on his part
of any sexual feeling she would withdraw immediately, and while
he had thought of her as a child in his care there had been no
danger. But he loved her; she was very mature for her age; he
must guard his every thought and action.</p>
<p>Intellectually their constant companionship had developed him
with remarkable effect. He read as she suggested, argued, fought
and now often won a battle. On this very afternoon they battled
with energy over Gide's <i>Les Faux-Monnayeurs.</i></p>
<p>'Well, of course,' Lizzie said, her small face tilted into
patronage, 'you have to read a great deal of French fiction
before you--'</p>
<p>'Nonsense,' Bullock said. 'I'm perfectly able to tell whether
I like a novel in French or any other language. Gide in his
dedication calls it his first <i>novel.</i> It isn't his first
because it isn't a novel. It's simply another of his eternal
autobiographies.'</p>
<p>'You're prejudiced against him because of his morals.'</p>
<p>'Certainly I'm not. Who cares nowadays anyway? But as a matter
of fact in this case it <i>does</i> matter because it makes him
lop-sided. Edouard is simply himself, and Edouard's ideas about
the novel are so very old-fashioned, getting down to reality and
all the rest of it. As though that isn't what everybody's been
doing for years <i>ad nauseam.</i> Besides if you're a true
creator you don't talk about your creation as he's always doing.
You just go along and create.'</p>
<p>Lizzie smiled. She was very pale, and her clothes now had a
worn, almost shabby look. The effect of them, if you did not see
her face, was to make her seem a little old woman, beautifully
neat and clean, but a little rusty. And then, when she turned and
you saw her face, you saw that she was a child, delicate,
anxious, proud. She refused to allow Bullock to do anything for
her except pay for meals and transit, a cinema or a cheap seat in
the theatre when they were together. Her father now never gave
her anything at all. Sometimes she saw money lying about and took
some of it and told him. Then he would be furious or humorous or
indifferent. She hardly ever saw him now alone. He seemed to be
glad that Bullock had taken her off his hands.</p>
<p>Once, in his own curious way, he had loved her. Now his
personal life was so desperate that he had no time nor ease to
think of her. On her side something remained of the love that
<i>she</i> had had, but she hated his surroundings and his
companions so intensely that she could not bear to be in that
place.</p>
<p>Bullock knew that she was now in terror although she would not
confess to it. Catastrophe had been down the street; now it was
there down their chimney.</p>
<p>Bullock took her hand in his.</p>
<p>'Don't let's talk about silly books. We must go along now
because I want a word with your father.'</p>
<p>Her hand jumped in his.</p>
<p>'Oh no--why?'</p>
<p>'Because he's got to answer me certain questions.'</p>
<p>'What questions?' Her eyes devoured his face and he was proud
to see how truly now she trusted him.</p>
<p>'He's in an awful mess. It gets worse every day. You know
that. If anything happens what does he do about you?'</p>
<p>'I go with him, I suppose,' she said simply. 'I always
have.'</p>
<p>'Oh no, you don't. Everything's different now. You belong to
me for ever and ever. You know that perfectly well.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I suppose so. But you haven't any money either.'</p>
<p>'No, but somehow I shall always have enough to look after you.
And then there's your aunt in Westminster. But the point is that
if your father has to leave England--well, in a hurry--I want to
make it perfectly plain that he can't just go and send for you
whenever he pleases. You don't belong to <i>him</i> any
more.'</p>
<p>She sat there, looking in front of her, her small anxious face
concentrated on a vision of the past. What a life it had been!
What adventures and escapes and shabby intrigues! What lovely
places and <i>lovely</i> people abandoned so often just when they
were especially lovely! And what <i>vile</i> people and
disgraceful words spoken and horrible things seen! And through it
all, that handsome figure of her father, often so merry, kind,
generous, loving her, she knew, when he cared for no one else in
the world. And now that man was gone, gone for ever. There was no
kindness, no generosity, no love. She knew, young as she was,
that it had been by his own fault, and by no hardship or
injustice of fate, that he had fallen. She drew no moral, made no
accusation; only her hands closed tightly on her lap, and she
bowed her head for a moment as she bade her father an eternal
farewell.</p>
<p>Captain Nicholas Coventry was wearing dark-blue pyjamas and a
dressing-gown of white and blue squares. His pyjama jacket was
open and revealed his pink chest, and a line above the navel,
where his belly began. He was running badly to fat. His ruddy
chin wore a thin white stubble. On his feet were soiled
red-leather slippers. He was broad, almost feminine, in the beam.
His hair was too long above his ears.</p>
<p>But his eyes were wide open. He was not at all bleary-eyed;
all his senses were alert. On the table were the dirty remains of
a cold-ham-and-beer breakfast. He sat, his legs spread, holding
on to the back of a chair, and he was quite clearly at bay, his
ears cocked back for the slightest clink of a danger.</p>
<p>Although it was late in the afternoon Bullock could see,
through the half-open door, that his bed was still unmade. It
seemed from the appearance of the pillows that two persons had
been sleeping in it, but there was no sign of anyone about the
place. Lizzie had told him that the half-caste had disappeared
some two or three days before. 'The first time he has left us for
years. He was always <i>following</i> Father, but now I don't
think he'll come back. He smells it's all over.'</p>
<p>Lizzie went into her little room to take off her hat.</p>
<p>'What do you want?' Captain Nicholas asked. He didn't draw his
pyjama jacket together in regard for his daughter. He didn't
recognize her in any way.</p>
<p>Then he said: 'Look here, have a drink. . . . I'm going to
have a bath. I was up all night so I've been sleeping all
day.'</p>
<p>'Did we wake you? Sorry,' Bullock said ironically. He had come
to hate Captain Nicholas Coventry. 'No, I don't want a
drink.'</p>
<p>'You can talk to me in my bath,' Captain Nicholas said,
hitching up his pyjama trousers.</p>
<p>'No, I can't,' Bullock said firmly, 'because Lizzie has to be
here. Come here, Lizzie.'</p>
<p>'What the hell do you want Lizzie for?'</p>
<p>'Because she must hear what I have to say.'</p>
<p>She stood near him. He put out his arm and drew her close to
him.</p>
<p>'Lizzie is still a child in years, but she isn't a child all
the same. You know I love her and she loves me.'</p>
<p>'Well?' said Captain Nicholas. 'Get on. I want my bath.'</p>
<p>'What a beast you are!' Bullock said, his round face flushing,
his hand trembling ever so slightly on Lizzie's shoulder. 'Here's
your only child who's stood every kind of horror and unkindness
from you, and you don't give a hang what happens to her.'</p>
<p>Captain Nicholas scratched his left breast. 'My dear boy, I
don't care, just now, what happens to anyone but myself. I'm in
the hell of a mess if you want to know, and Lizzie will shortly
have to look out for herself.' He looked at Bullock, and for a
fleeting moment there came into his face the old humorous charm
that had once been so persuasive. 'You're writing a novel, aren't
you? My daughter tells me so.'</p>
<p>'I am,' Bullock said briefly.</p>
<p>'It'll be a damned bad one. I can tell you that. You're much
too penny-plain twopence-coloured about human nature. You think
people are either good or bad. You're the hero and I'm the
villain. I assure you it isn't so. I'm <i>weak</i> if you like.
Deliberately so. I think it more amusing to yield to every
temptation that comes along. But I'm ever so much better a fellow
than you are. Now you don't do anything at all except try to
write a novel. I keep ever so many people employed and occupied,
including, it seems, the London police. I make young men, who
would otherwise be lazy, want to earn money that they may play
cards with me. Then I'm infinitely more amusing than you are,
know more about life than you will ever know, and make all kinds
of women believe that they are handsome and witty.'</p>
<p>'Never mind paying yourself compliments,' Bullock said. 'What
I've come here to find out is, if you have to leave the country
suddenly, what do you intend to do about Lizzie?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I leave her to you, dear boy, I leave her to you.'</p>
<p>'Yes. That's what I wanted to know. When you go I shall take
her to her aunt's in Westminster. In two years' time from now I
shall marry her.'</p>
<p>'She's a lucky girl,' said Captain Nicholas, grinning. 'Aren't
you, Liz?'</p>
<p>Lizzie said, 'If you want me, Father, I'll come with you.'</p>
<p>'No. I don't want you. It's got beyond that. It's come to a
time when it's all I can do to look after myself.' He moved into
the little bathroom. Behind the door he was turning on the water,
which made a tremendous noise. He appeared through the door,
stripped to the waist, red and grinning. 'But we're safe for a
day or two, I think. Be happy, my children.'</p>
<p>Then he shut the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'And so he's still unhappy--and wants to see me. Although it's
weeks now. . . .'</p>
<p>Kitty looked at the brief letter which said: 'I have been
inexcusable. I am in despair. Please give me a quarter of an
hour. I can be in the Park by the bandstand to-morrow, Wednesday,
about five. I shall be there in any case. Alton.'</p>
<p>They made assignations in the commonest way--although why not?
They were not lovers. She had not seen the boy since she had met
him with the florid woman in the Park on the last day of
September.</p>
<p>Kitty had, however, paid four visits to Alton's father. She
liked him. She was not in the least afraid of him. He was like
his paintings on the wall in his room--bad taste, strength and
honesty and, behind them, real and authentic beauty. He was the
strangest man she had ever known, but through contact with him
she was awaking to a kinship with reality that would give life an
additional dimension. But Alton? He was weak, hysterical,
foolish, but she felt for him a great tenderness. He was the
first person who had ever roused in her the feelings that she
might have for her own child.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She went to the Park. There was thin, slightly aromatic mist
as though she were in a windy lighted hall slightly dimmed with
cigarette smoke. He was waiting there, the collar of his overcoat
turned up, his hands jammed in its pockets.</p>
<p>'I wonder you've come. . . . You must hate me.'</p>
<p>'Hate you! No. Of course not. Let's walk a little. It's
chilly.'</p>
<p>'I didn't think you'd see me again.'</p>
<p>'But why on earth not?'</p>
<p>'I've let you down so horribly. And when you passed me the
other night . . .'</p>
<p>She said gently: 'I'm only sorry we haven't seen more of one
another.'</p>
<p>Words poured from him. 'I wasn't going to see you again. I'm
no good, no good at all. I'm still just as I was when I first saw
you. Just the same. But it's all no good. I can't write. My
play's hopeless and you knew it from the first. But you gave me a
sort of hope. There are millions like me who think they have
talent, who, when they read a thing, say: "I can do better than
that." But they can't really. And when they hear a woman like you
and who seems to be interested in them say: "Well, why not? What
does class matter these days? We're all the same now." But we're
not. There's a great gulf fixed between men like me and women
like you. When I kissed you that day of the storm I thought I'd
be a new man, different, wonderful. The world would recognize me
as a genius and then I could claim you. But of course I'm not a
genius, and just because you've been kind to me and visited us it
only makes the gulf seem wider.'</p>
<p>'Of course there's no gulf,' Kitty said. 'I told you I'd be
your friend and I will be always.'</p>
<p>'How can you be my friend? You can't take me into your
world--only if I were a wonderful artist or if you loved me so
passionately that you didn't care what happened or what people
said.'</p>
<p>'I don't care what people say.'</p>
<p>'No, I don't believe you do. But all the same I haven't the
kind of character to make it worth your while. And you're not in
love with me.' He paused.</p>
<p>'I'm not in love with anybody,' she said.</p>
<p>'No. It was a new experience for you and you were sorry for
me. And then soon you saw how ordinary I was. Why, my father is
more interesting to you than I am!'</p>
<p>He paused again.</p>
<p>'He is, isn't he?'</p>
<p>'I like your father. I think he's a very unusual man.'</p>
<p>'I hate my father. He's a beast.'</p>
<p>'Alton!'</p>
<p>'No. What do you know about it? You haven't lived with him for
years and years as I have--he pretending he's crippled so that he
can be lazy and get us to slave for him, and he do his horrible
paintings.' He looked up at her beseechingly. 'I don't know what
I'm saying. It isn't true that there's nothing the matter with
him. He did have a fall and hurt his spine. But he's been getting
better and better. Ever since you first came. Did you know he's
sitting up now and he can walk round the room? Well, never mind.
What does it matter? I only wanted to tell you that I'm grateful
to you for being kind and I mustn't see you again. There's
another lady. She's not like you. There couldn't be anyone more
different. But she's what I'm meant for. She's my sort.'</p>
<p>'Are you going to be married?' Kitty asked.</p>
<p>'No. Of course not. She's older, years older. Don't ask me
about her. Not a word. She's nothing to do with us. I'm no good.
I had a dream. I've woken up.'</p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>'Now, Alton, listen to me for a minute. I don't think you know
much about life yet and I don't either. We're both alike in that.
But what I said before is true. I'm your friend now and always.
What you do with your life isn't my affair, but at any
time--years from now if you like--I'll be your friend just the
same, help you if I can, perhaps ask you to help <i>me</i>--'</p>
<p>She broke off. She wanted so dreadfully to help him and she
hadn't the least idea how to do it. Standing there under the
misted trees she realized that she knew nothing about men,
nothing about life, nothing about Alton. She had everything,
absolutely everything, to learn.</p>
<p>He stood and held out his hand.</p>
<p>'Well, good-bye. You'll be always a kind of miracle to me. A
moment's miracle.'</p>
<p>He touched her hand and went.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kitty Delaney felt anything but a 'miracle' as she walked
through the thickening mist homewards. She was very unhappy. In
the first place, she was a really nice girl and, like most of the
young women of her generation, hated that anyone should be
miserable. They are reputed, her generation, to be hard and fast
and selfish. On the contrary they are practical, tender-hearted,
and think less about sex than the general state of the world.
This last thing they find rotten and they have, for the most
part, learnt how in this way or that to ameliorate it a little.
But this Foster affair was actually Kitty's very first effort at
ameliorating something, and she had done, it seemed, nothing but
harm to the Fosters.</p>
<p>She had heard, from time to time, the epithet applied to the
Delaneys, generally in scorn--the 'joyful' Delaneys--and had
always resented it. Now she saw the reason for that resentment.
Their family happiness had kept them all from knowing anything
about real life. They were all playboys, and to be that at this
terrible time of world crisis was dreadful indeed.</p>
<p>They had been happy because they had been living in a kind of
fairy-tale, but <i>now,</i> Kitty reflected more cheerfully,
everything was about to change. Soon, very soon, they would
either be penniless or have sold the house. Either event would
plunge them beyond question into reality and would surely check
their good spirits. But would it be so? She and her father and
mother had, during the last week or two, suffered intolerable
hardships. That is--there had been, in answer to advertisements
in <i>The Times</i> and the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> a constant
succession of ladies and gentlemen wondering whether they would
take 'a flat.' Old gentlemen, young gentlemen, ladies who were so
ancient that they had to be carried from room to room, young
women brisk, practical, full of sex, without any sex at all. The
would-be tenants had apparently only one thing in common--they
wanted something for nothing. When they heard what the rent was
they all exclaimed alike; and yet Fred Delaney had thought the
rent moderate. They said the flats were not modern enough. The
water-closets were especially unsatisfactory, although Fred could
not discover why. And, of course, there was no central heating.
It came to this: that for those who had the money the flats were
not good enough, and those for whom the flats <i>were</i> good
enough had no money. The <i>rudeness</i> of those who had the
money! Their patronage, conceit, laziness! And those who had
<i>not</i> the money, how friendly they were, how obsequious, how
anxious to move in <i>at once</i>!</p>
<p>One lady, carrying a Pekinese dog, smoking a cigarette from a
holder as long as her pedigree (she gave Fred reels and reels of
this), with a little squashed face creased with powder, irregular
eyebrows and lips so bloodily red that it was like reading a
murder case in the paper to look at them, wanted, in a high
shrill baby voice (the sound that comes from a
poke-me-in-the-stomach doll), to move in at once, at once! 'Why
should I wait?' she screamed. 'Why should Po-Ko and I wait? They
suit me perfectly. I can send for my things. All that I really
need is a saucer of milk for Po-Ko!' It was quickly discovered,
alas! that Mrs. Lane Fosby Featherstone had not a bean in the
world and owed mountains and mountains of beans to unfortunate,
trusting shopkeepers. Then one slim lady, suddenly flashing her
eye like a lighthouse beam on to Meg's innocent countenance,
said: 'A young man committed suicide in these rooms, did he not?'
After that, everyone seemed to know it, always enquired
ghoulishly to behold exactly the spot where the deed had been
committed, and then, after a thrilled and exhaustive examination,
declared that it wouldn't be possible to live in a house where
there had been a suicide.</p>
<p>'Statistics,' Fred Delaney said cheerfully, 'show that there
has been, at one time or another, a suicide in every house in
London.'</p>
<p>'But this is so recent.'</p>
<p>'That means that there won't be another here for at least a
century. The average is--one a century.'</p>
<p>Beastly of them, Kitty thought, to behave thus about poor
Smoke; but then they hadn't known him. It did make such a
difference if you knew somebody!</p>
<p>Very shortly a decision must be come to--sale, mortgage, or
tenants. Kitty loved both her parents, but especially, perhaps,
her father, and she did realize that leaving the house would be
appalling for them and would separate all the family for the
first time in their lives.</p>
<p>Bullock would <i>have</i> to get a job somewhere and would
marry one day, she supposed, that funny pale silent child of his.
And she--would she marry Colonel Beaminster?</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no! Never, never! At that she realized, standing
now in Charles Street, just outside the beloved house, why it was
that she was happy in spite of her dreadful failure with Alton
Foster, and Colonel Beaminster's ardent desire for her. It was
because she was free! Alton's father had in some mysterious,
coarse, but vital fashion, given her a sense of the positive
<i>experience</i> of life--hurting, wounding, scorning, maiming,
slaughtering, but <i>life!</i> She was free, she was alive, she
was in love with no one. But she would be, she would be! She was
on the verge! She was about to plunge into a miraculous, tossing,
spuming, thundering sea!</p>
<p>All very well. But what she found when she entered the
firelit, friendly, gaily-coloured room was little Millie Pake
looking so old, so wan and so fragile that it was heartbreaking
to behold.</p>
<p>'Millie! You darling! At last! We thought we were never going
to see you again!'</p>
<p>Millie was greatly touched by her love and sympathy; indeed
for a moment Kitty thought that Millie was going to cry. She was
made of sterner stuff. She sat down in her rather faded black
dress and talked.</p>
<p>'But where's Mother? Does she know you're here?'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, dear. We were having a nice talk when someone arrived
to see the flats.'</p>
<p>'Poor Mother. . . . But tell me--where are you living and why
haven't you been to see us before?'</p>
<p>'I've been in the country with my brother. I didn't want to
come and see you until I was settled.'</p>
<p>'And where <i>are</i> you settled?'</p>
<p>'In Bloomsbury, dear. A very nice room quite close to the
Ivanhoe Hotel.'</p>
<p>'Why,' Kitty thought, 'I don't believe she's having enough to
eat. I'm sure she isn't.'</p>
<p>'Bloomsbury--but do you like it there?'</p>
<p>'Not so much as here, dear, of course. But one must go where
one can afford.'</p>
<p>'Oh dear--how I wish you could come back here! But I'm afraid
we shall have to sell the house.'</p>
<p>'So your mother's been telling me. It seems <i>such</i> a
pity, such a terrible pity.'</p>
<p>'Of course it is. I don't know what poor Father will do. But
it's money. Everything's money nowadays.'</p>
<p>Meg came in. 'Thank heaven <i>they're</i> gone! . . . Oh,
there you are, dear. Now, Millie darling, we'll have some
tea.'</p>
<p>'There's something up with Mother,' Kitty thought. 'She's in a
very odd state of excitement.'</p>
<p>Caesar brought in the tea and there seemed something strange
about him too.</p>
<p>'What's the matter with Caesar?' Kitty asked.</p>
<p>'He's having a dreadful time with his old mother. She's found
out he's got a girl and he won't give her up.'</p>
<p>'I should think not indeed.'</p>
<p>Millie got up to go. There was a slight fog and the bus would
be slow. Kitty felt a sense of acute discomfort at the thought of
the dreary lonely room to which she must be returning.</p>
<p>'Look here, dear. Mother and I will come and take you out to
lunch to-morrow.'</p>
<p>'Very soon, dear, we will,' Meg said, kissing Millie. 'I'm
afraid I can't to-morrow. I'm going away for the week-end.'</p>
<p>Kitty turned on her.</p>
<p>'You are? First I've heard of it. Why, wherever to?'</p>
<p>'To some friends, dear.'</p>
<p>'What--you and Father?'</p>
<p>'No. Father <i>is</i> going away, I believe--but somewhere
else. To some shooting, I think.'</p>
<p>'Well--what do you think of that!' Kitty cried.</p>
<p>'Very nice,' Millie Pake said at the door. 'Going away for the
week-ends. I used to think it the greatest fun.'</p>
<p>'I'll come and take you out to lunch by myself, then. What's
the address?'</p>
<p>'I think we'd better meet somewhere,' Millie said.</p>
<p>'All right, then. Let's meet at Oxford Circus outside the
Tube. One o'clock. Good-bye, darling. Look after yourself.'</p>
<p>Back in the room again Kitty looked at her mother.</p>
<p>'Where on earth are you off to to-morrow?'</p>
<p>'I'm going to stay with friends.'</p>
<p>'And that's all I'm to know?'</p>
<p>'That's all you're to know.'</p>
<p>Kitty kissed her.</p>
<p>'Oh, well, you deserve a bit of fun.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Meg. 'I think I do.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h2>MEG</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>'Crossing the Park is like crossing the Rubicon,' Fred Delaney
had once said. Meg was not quite sure of anything about the
Rubicon except that it was a river, but she did wake very early
in the morning from a strange dream in which a schoolmistress in
a gown and mortar-board had cried out: 'Now, Meg Delaney, if you
can't jump the Park you've failed. It ought to be quite easy
after all the exercise you've been taking.'</p>
<p>She looked at the Park and it was a broad brown piece of soil
with trees on the other side. The trees were crowded with birds,
all squawking at once. She jumped--and woke to the thin grey
light behind the curtains and Fred's stout body in the next bed
huddled and sleep-soaked, his gentle comfortable breathing
speaking its usual reassurance and safety.</p>
<p>Safety! That was all very well. <i>This</i> was the day! She
did not sleep another wink.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At about a quarter to twelve Fred Delaney, looking very smart
and debonair, kissed her and patted her on the shoulder.</p>
<p>'Well, old dear, I'm off.'</p>
<p>'What time's your train?'</p>
<p>'Oh, somewhere round one. I shall look in at the Club.'</p>
<p>She kissed him.</p>
<p>'Good-bye, darling. Sure you've packed everything?'</p>
<p>'I think so.'</p>
<p>'Look after yourself. Mind you shoot well. Don't disgrace the
family.'</p>
<p>There was a little pause at that.</p>
<p>'And you look after <i>yourself.'</i></p>
<p>'Oh, of course. What time will you be back on Monday?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I don't know. Some time in the morning.'</p>
<p>'I'll expect you for lunch, then.'</p>
<p>Fred was gone. And then there was Bullock.</p>
<p>'I say, darling--it's such a lovely day. Why don't you come to
Kew this afternoon with Lizzie and me?'</p>
<p>Meg sat down in a corner of the sofa with her book.</p>
<p>'Didn't you know, dear? I'm going away for the week-end.'</p>
<p>Bullock stared.</p>
<p>'Oh, are you? Wherever to?'</p>
<p>'Just to some friends. People you don't know, dear.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Lord! . . . and Father's going away too, isn't he?'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear. . . . He's gone.'</p>
<p>'How extremely rum! Who's going to look after the prospective
tenants?'</p>
<p>'Oh, Caesar will show them round if you and Kitty are out.
They don't come much at week-ends.'</p>
<p>'No. I suppose they don't.'</p>
<p>Bullock stared at his mother speculatively for a moment,
kissed her on the forehead.</p>
<p>'So long, darling. I hope you have a lovely time. Back Monday
morning?'</p>
<p>'I expect so.'</p>
<p>'Right-ho.' Bullock went out, whistling.</p>
<p>Meg sat there with the very clever novel on her knee. She was
holding it upside-down. The house was silent about her, the sun
pouring joyfully into the room.</p>
<p>She was to meet Graham Pender at Paddington Station at four
o'clock. Caesar would bring her in a little something to eat on a
tray. Her face was hot, as though someone had slapped her. She
was in a state of thrilling anticipation, dismay,
self-disapproval, self-glorification, vanity and tenderness. She
felt as though she were sitting in the middle of the sofa, one
arm round Fred, the other round Graham. No--<i>not</i> round
Fred, for he had gone to spend a week-end of sin with Alice Van
Renn. She hated Alice Van Renn! Oh, how she hated her!--and this
week-end of hers that was to be spent near Oxford was in a way a
slap in the face of Alice Van Renn. Not that Alice would care.
But Fred would and did.</p>
<p>He had come out of his dressing-room that morning and said, as
she sat at the looking-glass brushing her beautiful hair:</p>
<p>'Where are you going, Meg? This week-end, I mean?'</p>
<p>'I'll tell you,' she had answered, 'if you'll tell me where
<i>you're</i> going.'</p>
<p>'I think we're a pair of bloody fools,' he had answered.</p>
<p>And so perhaps they were. Meg had, of course, never been
unfaithful to him before. She did not <i>know</i> that she was
going to be unfaithful to him now. She was hoping to give poor
Graham a little happiness for an hour or two, so that, as he
said, he 'would have something to remember.' She was doing, she
said to herself over and over again, 'no one any sort of harm.'
She was sure, by this time, that that strange woman, Evelyn
Pender, knew all about it and was quite agreeable to Graham's
'having a little adventure.' She was as sure of Graham as Meg was
of Fred. Or was she? Was anyone ever sure of anyone? Well, then,
suppose no one was. This was a definitely <i>wicked</i> thing
that Meg was going to do--and Meg didn't care! It was her last,
her very last fling! And how many middle-aged, happily married
women there were who would adore to have a last fling and would
be all the better for it if they did! How many virtuous married
women there were, who saw old age stealthily approaching and
<i>did</i> have a last fling--if only the whole truth were
known!</p>
<p>But it was no use at all to think of other women! Other women
might commit their sins their own way. Everyone's history was his
or her own history.</p>
<p>She remembered a dear old priest to whom she had listened once
as he talked on the wireless about Chastity. It was clear that he
had a most charming personality; it was also clear that he knew
nothing whatever about the perils and sins and urgencies of the
flesh. Here was Meg Delaney, middle-aged and handsome, happily
married, who yet had the devil in her and longed before she died
that some man, not her husband, should tell her that he loved
her, should say the pretty things and look at her as though she
were the queen of the earth and tell her that she was still
beautiful. Only this once before she died! And why was it so
evil? She was married to a man who loved her, but who yet had
been physically unfaithful to her and would be again. He did not
love her the less for that infidelity, and she, through long
training, had learnt not to be inquisitive and not to be jealous.
The fires in him were already dying down. Already he almost never
left her side. Had she been the other sort of wife, tiresome,
nagging, resentful, reminding, would he not have fled from her
long ago? From her babyhood almost she had learnt that men must
be patiently borne with by women. Even the best of them would
stray at times. No. <i>Not</i> the best of them! There
<i>were</i> men whose fidelity, self-sacrifice, chastity, made
them miracles. She had met one or two. But then she had always
noticed that their chaste marital fidelity gave them a kind of
thin, unhumorous, greedy air. They sat over their wives as a hen
sits brooding on an egg!</p>
<p>Ah! it was a difficult, difficult world, and women who loved
life and knew that soon--ah! so soon! so soon!--they would wither
and decay--poor women--God be merciful to them!</p>
<p>And--at that moment's thought of the God in Whom she
believed--she pushed her mind away and turned her novel right
side up and walked about the room and sat down again and said:
'Ah, Caesar, here's the lunch--that's good!' because she knew
that it was a wicked thing that she was about to do and that the
less she thought about God (until the thing was over) the
better.</p>
<p>Caesar was looking extremely lugubrious. There were heavy
lines about his eyes as though he had not been sleeping.</p>
<p>'Here are the soup and the fish. I'll bring in the cutlet
presently.'</p>
<p>'You don't look very well, Caesar. What's the matter?'</p>
<p>He stood before her, in his black suit, a mere unhappy
child.</p>
<p>'It's my mother, Mrs. Delaney. She's been carrying on
something dreadful.'</p>
<p>'I shouldn't live with her, then.'</p>
<p>'I can't very well help it. She'd be all alone by
herself.'</p>
<p>'It's ridiculous. No mother can stop her son marrying. It's
right and fair he should.'</p>
<p>'What's all wrong, Mrs. Delaney, is that she won't see the
girl. She's ever so nice and sweet. If Mother saw her she'd
<i>have</i> to like her.'</p>
<p>'I shouldn't count on that,' said Meg.</p>
<p>'No, perhaps you're right, Mrs. Delaney. And there's something
else. There's this man in the Market won't leave her alone.'
Caesar's brow darkened. He looked really formidable. 'I'm a bit
of a boxer,' Caesar said. 'And if I catch him at his games
there'll be murder done. My girl hates him and slapped his face
night before last.'</p>
<p>'Who is the man?'</p>
<p>'His name's Brocket. He's a beast, that's what he is.'</p>
<p>'Don't you worry, Caesar. It'll all come right.' She sighed.
'The only sad thing is that it really looks as though we shall
have to sell the house. We <i>can't</i> get anyone to take the
rooms.'</p>
<p>'No. I know,' said Caesar, looking even more lugubrious.
'Aren't they awful? The people that come, I mean. They don't know
<i>what</i> they want.'</p>
<p>'They know only too well what they want. They don't want to
live here--that's all. However, you'll soon get another place.
And better than this!'</p>
<p>'Oh, Mrs. Delaney, I don't want to leave you--I don't indeed.
And my girl and me's been thinking. If you've got to go to a
smaller place--well--she cooks beautiful. She's an artist. She
really is. And we were thinking--' Then embarrassment suddenly
took him, and muttering something about 'cutlets' he retired.</p>
<p>It was half-past two. She need not leave for the station until
half-past three. In her state of agitation she could not remain
still. She would walk a little.</p>
<p>She walked slowly and as she walked she thought: 'I'll have to
go now anyway. It would be too awful to have the long Sunday in
London knowing all the time where Fred is. Suppose Evelyn Pender
is planning some horrible trick, suddenly turns up or sets spies
on us or something! Suppose she divorces Graham! Oh, but she
<i>never</i> would! . . . I feel ridiculous--exactly as I used to
in Nice when I had fifty francs unexpectedly to spend, and as I
did when I hurt Mademoiselle's feelings by saying something rude
and personal. I feel <i>now</i> as though already I had done some
incalculable wrong to someone. . . . How ridiculous! There are, I
suppose, hundreds of women--and not so young either--going off
this week-end with men they're not married to. The curious thing
is that I'm terribly excited but <i>not</i> very happy. Not my
usual happiness. But when I see Graham waiting there at
Paddington I shall forget everything else in seeing <i>his</i>
happiness! But there must be no more of these meetings--not after
this one. I must make that clear to him. There must never be
another. Oh dear! Here I am in Shepherd Market. . . .'</p>
<p>It was strange, she thought, that as soon as you passed under
Miss Bonda's archway your standards of excitement, beauty,
sensation, seemed to alter. There was, for example, nothing
exceptional about 'Ye Grapes' at the corner of Market Street, and
yet it would not at all surprise you to see Shakespeare and Ben
Jonson walking out of it arm in arm, wiping their beards. Nor was
there anything out of the ordinary handsome about the fish-shop,
and yet it positively <i>reeked</i> of the sea as though you were
enjoying a holiday at Mevagissey, Penberth Cove, Bedruthan Steps
and Bude all at the same time.</p>
<p>Meg had a curious sensation as though, when she stepped into
Market Street, something whispered to her: 'You've altered your
life by walking in here. Everyone who walks in here at certain
changes of the moon does.'</p>
<p>She looked at her wrist-watch. It was ten minutes to three.
She would have started back to Charles Street, but a curious,
cracked, rather 'horsy' voice detained her. She was standing,
without knowing it, outside the bookshop that had the shelf of
'sixpenny' and 'twopenny' volumes; and very good value most of
them were!</p>
<p>At her side was a middle-aged lady, short and
square-shouldered, wearing a black straw hat with a pin through
it such as they wore in the nineteen-hundreds. She was searching
rather short-sightedly along the row of 'sixpennies.'</p>
<p>'If you see,' she said, without even looking at Meg, '<i>Red
Pottage</i> anywhere, do let me know.'</p>
<p>'<i>Red Pottage?</i>' asked Meg.</p>
<p>'Yes. By Mary Cholmondeley. It's got a red cover and was
published by Edward Arnold. It turns up in every sixpenny lot, as
fresh as a strawberry. It was a best seller in its day--like
<i>The Heavenly Twins</i> and <i>The School for Saints.</i> They
turn up too all the time, poor things. Not the three-volume
<i>Heavenly Twins.</i> That's rather rare, of course. But <i>The
School for Saints.</i> I'm sure there's one somewhere. Yes, there
it is. You can't mistake it. There must have been
<i>thousands</i> of it. Poor Pearl Craigie. I knew her very well.
Such a clever woman, but too sensitive. Took herself too
seriously. All women novelists do. But it's <i>Red Pottage</i>
I'm after. Such an exciting book! The clergyman burns Hester's
manuscript in the fire because he thinks it immoral. <i>What</i>
a lot of manuscripts he'd have to burn nowadays, wouldn't he? I'm
sure they <i>must</i> have <i>Red Pottage</i> somewhere.' Then
she looked up at Meg and smiled. She was one of those plain dowdy
Englishwomen who, because they are so plain and so dowdy, are so
obviously ladies.</p>
<p>Meg would have been delighted to stop and talk to her, but she
said, looking at her watch again: 'No, I've never read <i>Red
Pottage,</i> I'm afraid.' She smiled in her friendly easy way
that had led her so frequently into quick intimacy with the
completest strangers. 'I must be getting on. I've got to catch a
train.'</p>
<p>'Ah, going into the country for the week-end,' said the other
lady, nodding her head. 'Very pleasant in fine weather like this.
I've got to go to a meeting of the Down-at-Heels Committee. Such
a bore.'</p>
<p>So they parted in the friendliest manner and Meg turned once
again to the Market exit. But now she was stopped by a cat. Cats,
of course, abound in the Market, but they are mostly of the
secret-purpose I've-no-time-to-waste-on-humans variety. This cat
was a large yellow one and he came deliberately and rubbed
himself against Meg's dress. This was more than Meg could resist
and she bent down and stroked him. This enchanted the cat, who
purred like a giant tea-kettle, arched his back, walked a little
like a bandmaster in a royal procession, and looked up at Meg
with large green eyes full of love. Meg was delighted. The cat
seemed in some way to reassure her. She walked a little way, the
cat following her. Then, as though the cat had directed her, she
looked upwards. There was White Horse Street, in no way
remarkable or beautiful. A window on the top floor of one of the
buildings was open. As Meg gazed, in it appeared the terrified,
agonized face of Claude Willoughby.</p>
<p>The face stared at her without seeing her. Yes, it was
terrified and agonized--an old, worn, seamed countenance, of an
old, old man crazy with fright. Meg thought that he would call
out but he did not. He was there and was gone.</p>
<p>Without a moment's hesitation Meg crossed to the building
whose window it was. As she arrived, a tall, very complacent
elegant gentleman came out. He looked seriously in front of him
as though he were recognizing that God had truly been made in his
image and should be grateful for His good fortune. This, although
Meg did not know it, was Colonel Badget going for his afternoon
walk. Letting Badget out let Meg in. Inside the dark and fusty
hall was the traditional serving-maid of the music-hall, grimy,
sniffing, and looking surreptitiously through the 'gentlemen's
letters' just arrived by post. On to her Meg seized.</p>
<p>'Tell me, please, which is Mr. Willoughby's room.'</p>
<p>The girl, startled, dropped the letters, looked down at them
stupidly, then said as though speaking in her sleep: 'Upstairs.
Top floor.'</p>
<p>And up the stairs Meg went. The sunlight struck the top
landing, illuminating a rickety hat-stand, a mildewed print of
Frith's 'Railway Station,' and a pail with a dirty cloth. There
was also a door, and on this Meg knocked.</p>
<p>There was no answer, so she turned the handle and went in. She
will never forget every small detail of this afternoon.
Especially not Claude's room--the shabby table with the worn
silver brushes, the cabinet with the Things, the grate with a fan
of red paper, the bed with the tear in the counterpane, the open
window in whose air the sun played like a water-misted firework.
She saw these things later. For the moment her attention was
caught fixedly by the actors in the little drama played here.</p>
<p>Claude Willoughby was stretched in the sunlight against the
torn wallpaper, almost as though he were crucified. But his thin
arms were bent forward as though he were protecting himself
against something. Almost touching him was a man, his
shirt-sleeves rolled up, a dirty apron round his belly, his
shabby back distended towards the door. This man's horrid nose
was but the breadth of a hair from Claude's nose. His eyes stared
into Claude's eyes. One dirty hand at the end of the naked hairy
arm moved like an animal in space. Neither heard the door open.
The man was saying: 'It's come to this, then. You're not safe to
be left. You do what I tell you, see, or I'll be handing you over
to the authorities. It's no sort of good your trying to throw
yourself out of window. That won't help you. Anyhow, you haven't
the pluck. What <i>you</i> 'ave to do, Mr. Claude Willoughby,
from now on is to do as I tell you, see? When I says "Go" you go,
and when I says "Come" you bloody well come. I says "Stand up"
and you stand up. Otherwise they'll be taking you away, and do
you know where they'll be taking you?'</p>
<p>'No,' whispered Claude.</p>
<p>'They'll be taking you to a lonely house, miles from anywhere,
and the windows will all have bars in front of them, and there
you'll be, shut up in a little room with padded walls, and all
you'll hear, night <i>and</i> day, will be the screams of the
other loonies--see?'</p>
<p>'Oh no, no,' whispered Claude.</p>
<p>It seemed to Meg time to break in upon this monologue, so she
said:</p>
<p>'I wish to speak to Mr. Willoughby.'</p>
<p>The man sprang round as though a hornet had stung him. He
stared at Meg Delaney as though she had spectre-thickened
straight out of the dirty carpet. He was, she thought, as
nasty-looking a man as she had ever set eyes on.</p>
<p>'And what the hell . . .' he began. Then his voice changed. As
I have said elsewhere, Brocket had been trained to recognize a
lady when he saw one. Meg must have been a handsome sight, very
smart in her dark-blue travelling costume, wrath and indignation
in her splendid eyes, as tall and noble and commanding as Juno
herself. Brocket knew nothing about Juno, but he began: 'I beg
your pardon, madam. You have mistaken, I think--'</p>
<p>However, he was interrupted by a little sigh--the sort of sigh
that a child gives when it turns over in its sleep, and he
swerved to find Claude Willoughby in an unconscious heap upon the
floor.</p>
<p>Meg went at once and, picking him up, carried him like a baby
to the bed, upon which she laid him.</p>
<p>'Don't stand there gaping, you fool. Get some water.'</p>
<p>Brocket went to the jug and basin and poured out some water.
He handed her the basin and the towel. She bent over Claude,
bathing his forehead, undoing his collar, chafing his hands and
murmuring: 'There! There . . . there's nothing to be frightened
of. No one shall hurt you. It's all right. You're quite
safe.'</p>
<p>Once she turned fiercely on Brocket. 'He looks half starved.
What have you been doing to him?'</p>
<p>Brocket murmured: 'It's none of my business. He's old. He
wants looking after.'</p>
<p>She turned back to the bed. She had taken off her hat, and her
glorious hair was revealed to the unworthy Brocket. As she bent
forward he could not help thinking, in spite of the discomfort
that he was feeling, that she was as fine a woman as he'd ever
seen.</p>
<p>Claude stirred. He opened his eyes, saw Meg, smiled faintly
and closed them again.</p>
<p>'Soon,' Meg said, 'when he's recovered a little we must get
him to bed.'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am,' said Brocket. He had recovered his assurance.
After all, this commanding woman had overheard, in all
probability, little of what he had been saying. He was, however,
instantly undeceived.</p>
<p>She was sitting now on the bed's edge, rubbing Claude's wrists
and moistening his forehead. He seemed to her, with his
even-drawn lips, sunken cheeks, dark heavy eyelids, like half a
ghost already. She turned to Brocket, who for her unpleasantly
scented the air.</p>
<p>'What have you been doing to let him get into this state?'</p>
<p>'It's none of my business. He's only my tenant.'</p>
<p>'Of course it's your business.' Meg's eyes seemed to swallow
him into their angry dark depths and he turned his head away. 'In
any case what were you saying to him when I came in?'</p>
<p>'I was saying nothing, ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, you were. I was standing there several minutes before
you knew it. You were threatening him with an asylum.'</p>
<p>'Not threatening, ma'am. Only saying that he oughtn't to be
left alone by himself.'</p>
<p>Meg broke in furiously. She lost her temper at times with
royal abandon.</p>
<p>'I've had enough of your lying. One's only got to look at you
to see what lies you tell. You've been bullying Mr. Willoughby
for ever so long. I can see you're the sort of person that loves
to bully.'</p>
<p>Brocket's body gave a sort of squirm.</p>
<p>'You'd better be careful,' he said. 'That's libellous.'</p>
<p>'What the hell do I care for libel?' Meg got up and stood over
him like an avenging demon. She gave her hair a tug as she always
did when she was in a fury. Her long crystal ear-rings swung
backwards and forwards as though they were greatly enjoying the
scene.</p>
<p>'Do you think I've lived so long and been thrown about anyhow
ever since I was born to worry myself at being threatened by a
fat worm like you? You talk to me again like that and I'll go
straight to the window and call the police. There's plenty you
don't want <i>them</i> to be interfering with, I'll be bound.
Here's this poor man, starving to death in this cold bare room,
and instead of kindness you've been trying to drive him into
madness. Oh yes! I heard every word you said. Another piece of
impertinence from you and straight to gaol you go. And that's the
bloody truth. And if you don't think that ladylike, you can just
take it that "bloody" is the only word that applies to men like
you. Do you hear?'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am,' said Brocket, frightened, of course, but
thinking that she'd be a grand piece to make love to if she'd
been in another walk of life.</p>
<p>Claude opened his eyes again. He said very feebly: 'Don't let
him touch me.'</p>
<p>'No, of course he shan't,' Meg said. 'Nor myself either if I
can help it.' She turned back again. 'Here, you. What's your
name?'</p>
<p>'Brocket, ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Tell them to get a hot-water bottle ready. And to prepare
some good strong soup. Is there a telephone anywhere?'</p>
<p>'In the passage there's a tube you blow down.'</p>
<p>'Go and blow down it, then.'</p>
<p>Brocket went. Claude seemed to be sleeping. He was breathing
now quietly and gently. It was then that she suddenly thought of
the time. She looked at her watch. It was a quarter past three.
Good God! She could just do it now if she started at once back to
the house! Of all inconceivable things she had entirely forgotten
Graham! She stood up and in her agitation began to speak
aloud.</p>
<p>'This is frightful. I must go. How <i>could</i> I forget?'</p>
<p>Brocket re-entered.</p>
<p>'The bottle and the soup are both ordered, ma'am.'</p>
<p>She had just time if she was very swift to get Claude into bed
and see him comfortable.</p>
<p>'Hurry now. Help me. Where are his pyjamas? We must get him to
bed.'</p>
<p>Brocket felt beneath the pillow without disturbing Claude and
produced some worn-threadbare pyjamas in white and brown
stripes.</p>
<p>'Now I'll lift him. Get his boots off.' She put her broad arm
round Claude and his head rested on her comfortable bosom. He
opened his eyes again and said once more: 'Don't let him touch
me.' He stared into her face and was quite unaware, happily, of
Brocket's movements.</p>
<p>'He doesn't seem exactly in love with you,' Meg said
grimly.</p>
<p>'These old gentlemen get funny ideas.'</p>
<p>'Yes, I daresay. This will want looking into.'</p>
<p>Brocket, not ungently, had pulled off his boots and socks.
They stripped him and put the pyjamas on. What a skeleton he was!
How white with that deadly whiteness of the starved and dying!
Meg kissed his forehead, then, picking him up in her arms,
holding him for a moment against her breast, while Brocket turned
back the clothes and patted the pillows as though he had loved
dear Mr. Willoughby all his life long, they tucked the old man
in.</p>
<p>'Now--keep away. He'll have a fit if you touch him. What have
you done to make him so frightened of you?'</p>
<p>'I haven't done anything. In fact I've been good to him,
letting him off his rent and one thing and another.'</p>
<p>'I <i>bet</i> you've been good to him. Anyone can see that.
Where's that hot-water bottle? Go and blow down that thing
again!'</p>
<p>Brocket went.</p>
<p>She stroked Claude's forehead. He seemed to be in a deep
slumber. Now she must really go.</p>
<p>But Claude had turned and laid his thin blue-veined hand on
hers. He was speaking and she bent towards him that she might
hear him better.</p>
<p>'You won't go, will you? Not for a minute. That was foolish of
me--fainting like that. That man frightens me. Silly--very
silly.'</p>
<p>'I'm afraid I must go,' she said gently. 'I have a train to
catch.'</p>
<p>His hand tightened on hers. 'No, don't go. Don't go,' he
whispered.</p>
<p>She stared at the door. Where <i>was</i> that oaf? Had he gone
himself to fetch that water-bottle? She looked again at her
watch. What was she to do? Now, even if there was a taxi in
Curzon Street and she rushed straight to the house and on to the
station, it would be a very near thing.</p>
<p>She saw very clearly a vivid picture of poor Graham pacing the
station. There he was with his dear friendly face puckered and
anxious, staring at the entrance, gazing at the station clock,
knowing the crowding-in of all those fears that he must for days
and nights have confronted, that, after all, at the last moment
she would be frightened and not come.</p>
<p>'Yes,' he would be saying. 'I might have known it. But she
should have warned me. She should have telephoned. It's cruel,
it's cruel. . . .'</p>
<p>'I must go,' she cried, springing up. 'It's all right. I'll
see that someone comes to look after you. I'll make it all right.
I'll make it all right.'</p>
<p>It was twenty to four. In another five minutes it would be too
late unless she went straight to the station without luggage,
clothes, anything. . . .</p>
<p>Brocket entered, carrying the hot-water bottle. 'The soup's
coming up and this is Colonel Badget's bottle. I don't know what
he--'</p>
<p>She snatched it from him.</p>
<p>'Give it me!' She put it into the bed, bent down and kissed
Claude's forehead once more. 'There. I must go. Indeed I must.
But now a nice sleep--'</p>
<p>Claude caught her arm with a hand astonishingly firm. He
agonizedly whispered: 'Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.
He's here. When you've gone he'll send for them and they'll take
me to the asylum. He said so. He--'</p>
<p>'Nonsense.' She tried to release her arm. 'He won't do
anything. I've talked to him. He won't do a thing.'</p>
<p>Then she looked and in Claude's face was such burning naked
terror that she knew that she could not go.</p>
<p>'Very well, then,' she said, laying her hand on his forehead.
'Don't be frightened. I'll stay.'</p>
<p>'Here's the soup, ma'am--and a little chicken. I thought it
could do no harm.'</p>
<p>'Harm! I should think not.'</p>
<p>She sat by the bed, taking the soup, leaving the chicken on
the table. She spoke to Brocket:</p>
<p>'You needn't stay. My name is Mrs. Delaney. Here is my card
with my address. You'd better be careful what you're up to. I
shall come and see Mr. Willoughby every day. I will leave a list
of things I want you to get before to-morrow. Who's his
doctor?'</p>
<p>'His doctor, ma'am. Why, he hasn't got one.'</p>
<p>'Who's the best general doctor round here?'</p>
<p>'Doctor Thompson in Half Moon Street. <i>He's</i> a good
doctor.'</p>
<p>'I shall telephone to him in the morning. If Mr. Willoughby is
worse in any way, you're at once to ring up Doctor Thompson and
ask him to come. Do you understand?'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.'</p>
<p>'Look in here later in the evening and see if he wants
anything. But don't stay. He can't abide you. Neither can I.'</p>
<p>'No, ma'am.'</p>
<p>'If I find you've been disagreeable to him in any way whatever
I'll have you instantly arrested.'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.' Then with a sudden unexpected sense of humour
Brocket added, grinning a dirty grin: 'You <i>would</i> look
foolish, ma'am!'</p>
<p>'Never mind what I'd look. Now clear out. I shall stay for a
short while until I see Mr. Willoughby is properly asleep.'</p>
<p>'Yes, ma'am.' Brocket withdrew, his slippers flapping behind
him. He threw her one last surreptitious look. He had really
never seen a finer, better built-up woman!</p>
<p>Claude took the soup and then the chicken. He never said a
word, only smiled once and again. When she had given him
everything he turned over, like a baby, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Meg sat down in the old chair and looked at the red paper in
the grate. The sun now did not shine directly into the room.
Everything was alive with a dancing light. She got up and closed
the open window. Now all was very still.</p>
<p>She sat there staring in front of her, and then, quite
unexpectedly to herself, began to cry--softly lest she should
disturb Claude.</p>
<p>She could see and feel nothing now but Graham Pender's
disappointment. There he was walking up and down the station!
There he was and there was the entrance, figures hurrying in and
out! He would think that she might have mistaken the platform. He
would enquire again its number. He would have, under his arm, a
bundle of illustrated papers that he had bought for her. He would
watch the clock now, in a kind of agony, for the thin greedy
fingers were eating up the minutes. Something had delayed her.
She would arrive, breathless, full of apologies. Ah! that was
she! At last! At last! He would move eagerly forward. No. . . .
No. . . . Five minutes to four. He would speak to the porter.
'Take my things out of the carriage. My friend may not be
coming.' Ah, now! Surely there she was, the porter behind her
carrying her bags. No. . . . No. . . . They were closing the
doors. He stood on the platform, his two bags at his feet. The
whistle blew. The train moved out.</p>
<p>Oh, poor Graham, poor poor Graham! Her tears stained her
cheeks. Furtively she blew her nose. Poor, poor Graham! For it
would not happen again. She knew that with a sudden sure
certainty, and after that, came with a clarity as though someone
had spoken to her--she was glad that it had not happened!</p>
<p>Glad? Yes: there was about her, around her, permeating the
room, a strong deep conviction of relief.</p>
<p>It was as though the air, which had clouded her senses for
months, was now unexpectedly clear. It came, in a fashion that
she could not then explain, from the bare shabby room in which
she was sitting, from the old tired man asleep in the bed. It had
some resemblance to the intense relief and happiness that one has
when, after a long meaningless quarrel with someone whom one
loves, there is a joyful reconciliation.</p>
<p>With whom was she reconciled? With herself?</p>
<p>There was an element of roughness and violence in her that
came, perhaps, from her muddled and messy childhood. How very
vulgar she had been, for instance, when she lost her temper with
that man just now! And that same violence had played its part in
her flirtation with Graham.</p>
<p>She saw now quite clearly that it would never have done, that
however right and natural it might be, in these enlightened days,
for other married women to have affairs with men not their
husbands, it was not right and natural for her.</p>
<p>Her vision and comprehension moved swiftly forward. It was as
though, in this stillness and removed from her own surroundings,
she saw twice as clearly as she had ever seen before. Everyone
must judge his or her own individual case. One must never judge
anyone else. But for oneself there were rules and circumstances,
and if one did not follow them, decline and fall ensued.</p>
<p>She saw, with amazing sharpness, the relationship between
herself and Fred. In their eagerness to give one another freedom
and liberty everything had been conceded. 'We love one another,'
they had said. '<i>Nothing</i> can touch that ever. So we may
have complete liberty.' But something, she saw, <i>could</i>
touch it! Had she gone for that weekend with Graham, her relation
to Fred would not afterwards have been the same. Nor her relation
to Graham. Nor her relation to Evelyn Pender. Nor her relation to
her children. The events of that week-end might be slight indeed.
Everyone declared that the old morality was dead and that women
especially in these days must have the same freedom as men. But
never mind about women! <i>This</i> was the adventure of one
woman, Margaret Delaney, and for one woman such an act would be
damaging, destructive, and would undermine all the security of
her married life.</p>
<p>There were laws and rules for herself which now she saw had to
be obeyed if the things that were important to her were to be
safe. Fred had said to her: 'I ask no questions. I love you too
much.' But Fred himself did not know, although he had lived with
her so long, what were <i>her</i> laws.</p>
<p>She was careless, excitable, passionate, impulsive: but
beneath all that she was something more. She had something good
in her possession, and, almost, that good in her had been
tarnished.</p>
<p><i>This</i> was her link with God. He had not said a word. He
had not stirred a finger. There had not been a whisper of His
voice. But He had not forgotten her.</p>
<p>She bent forward and, with closed hands, prayed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Claude was deeply asleep. She stole away. She let herself into
the house and gave a little shiver as she saw the room, the fire
out, the clever novel on the chair, silence and emptiness.</p>
<p>She took off her hat and sat down. The weekend would be
terrible. During every minute of it she would be aware of what
Fred was doing. Well, she must face it and must greet him on
Monday morning as though all was well. Was she perhaps allowing
<i>him</i> too much freedom? Were his gay adventures beginning to
interfere with their happy security? When they left this house,
as undoubtedly they must, would they slip apart and lose one
another? She sighed. How difficult life was! How cold and lonely
was this room!</p>
<p>Then something moved. It was Endless, who had been sleeping
under the chair. He came and rubbed his cold nose against her
hand with that ironical attitude of friendly indifference
especially his. She stroked his sleek coat, and her cheerfulness
began to return. She could never, God help her, be depressed for
very long!</p>
<p>She would steel herself to Fred's absence. She would spend a
gay Sunday with Kitty and Bullock and a friend or two. She would
not think of Fred--and of the detestable Alice: of Fred, of
Fred--nor hear his laugh, nor see his eyes, nor feel against her
lips the rough manliness of his cheek. She got up. She would
bathe her face, brush her hair, telephone to somebody.</p>
<p>She moved. She stood still--for she could hear, through the
half-open door, the turn of a key in the lock. Ah, thank heaven,
Bullock or Kitty was already back!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door was pushed open, and there, staring in surprise,
stood Fred Delaney.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c306" id="c306">CHAPTER VI</a></h1>
<h2>FRED</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Fred Delaney threw a glance across at the Green Park while he
waited at the corner of Half Moon Street, hailing a taxi from the
rank opposite.</p>
<p>He had walked that far, carrying his bag, the sort of imbecile
thing that he was for ever doing. He had simply gone straight out
of the house, his bag like a feather in his strength, virility,
happiness at the events in front of him. Easily he could walk
thus all the way to Victoria. The elegant page-boy, coming out of
the flats at No. 90 to run across the street and post a letter,
stopped for an instant and stared.</p>
<p>That brought Fred to his senses. He must not, to-day, make
himself too conspicuous! In any case he was not going to Victoria
Station--yet! He engaged a cab and told it to drive to the
Moonstone in Apple Tree Yard. The Moonstone was a small Bohemian
club of which he had been, for many years, a member. He would
lunch there, a cosy place where he would be unlikely to meet
anyone save a casual acquaintance.</p>
<p>The first person he <i>did</i> meet was Patrick Munden. He was
delighted and in his delight most genuine. He had always been
fond of Munden, had missed him badly during these last months,
and had felt perhaps a certain guilt and responsibility with
regard to him. If he had spoken earlier Smoke might have been
saved. But would it have been better if Smoke <i>had</i> been
saved?</p>
<p>Munden was arrogantly and amicably cheerful. 'You must come
and lunch with <i>us,</i> Fred. Two writing fellows. Rose and
Pargiter. You've heard of Rose, of course--an absolute ass and
writes the most awful tripe naturally, but Dodie likes him. . . .
Oh yes, Dodie and I are living together in Paris. Get on very
well. May marry. I don't know. . . . Work? Well, I <i>am</i> on a
poem--a long one. Title? I think of calling it "Nails and Rust."
I'm not sure. Come on. You'll like Pargiter.'</p>
<p>Fred didn't in fact like Pargiter very much; nevertheless it
was an agreeable luncheon. As with all the heroes of history from
Hector to Landru, Fred felt the uncrushed grapes of conquered
love anticipated on his palate. He had all the genial happiness
and tolerance of a male triumphant at the end of a long and
difficult chase. He drank the very poor Burgundy Munden had
ordered, secretly toasting the lady to whom he hoped to give,
that evening, the best wine a certain resort provided. So he
found Rose, who had all the anxious amiability of a popular
traditional novelist fallen among young highbrows, a pleasant, if
rather talkative, fellow, and although he couldn't say that he
<i>liked</i> Pargiter he listened to him with considerable
sympathy. For it seemed that Pargiter, who was thin, pale, with a
large faintly yellow nose and untidy corn-coloured hair, was
quite obsessed with his own injustices. Delaney noticed that he
never, from beginning to end of the meal, paid the slightest
attention to Rose, behaved as though he were not there at all,
and that stout rubicund benevolence was clearly distressed by his
rudeness. But perhaps it was not <i>really</i> rudeness! Pargiter
was too bitterly absorbed to notice irrelevancies.</p>
<p>'But it's damnable!' he cried. 'They say I'm the best
short-story writer in England--they all do--but then they compare
me to Tchekov. "Finer than Tchekov." Bunyan himself says it in
the <i>Literary Observer</i> only this week. Well and good. I
<i>am</i> finer in many respects. But can't they see they're
destroying <i>all</i> my sales by that comparison? Simply ruining
me! After all I've got three children even though I do live in
the country. But who wants to read Tchekov? The moment they
mention him in connection with myself, I'm dead. I'm done. No one
will buy me. And, after all, what comparison is there? My English
prose is as good, I fancy, without undue conceit, as any there's
been. Where's a better? But I'm English. My scene is English. My
characters are English. <i>Where</i> is the Tchekov comparison?
Nowhere. But it stops my books selling.'</p>
<p>Rose beamed upon them all.</p>
<p>'Of course short stories <i>don't</i> sell. In book form I
mean. Now my last book of stories as compared with my last novel
. . .'</p>
<p>But Pargiter behaved to him even as Betsy Trotwood to Miss
Murdstone. He disregarded him completely. He even addressed
himself to Fred in preference.</p>
<p>'You see,' he said very earnestly--'I'm afraid I didn't catch
your name.'</p>
<p>'Delaney,' Fred murmured. Mr. Delaney. I write novels too, as
you probably know, but they are another question altogether.
Tchekov <i>couldn't</i> write novels and so the comparison
doesn't apply. But doesn't it seem to you monstrous that someone
in my position should have to review rotten commercial fiction
and read for publishers and all the rest of it simply because
people <i>will</i> compare me with Tchekov?'</p>
<p>'I think it's <i>monstrous,'</i> Fred said cheerfully. Then he
turned to Munden. 'When are you coming to see us, Patrick, old
boy?'</p>
<p>'I'm returning to Paris to-morrow. Dodie has come into a bit
of money, you know. Yes, from an old aunt. Hard luck, isn't it,
on poor Smoke? If this had happened earlier <i>everything</i>
might have been different. However, I expect it was all for the
best. Dodie thinks so.'</p>
<p>'If you're coming to see us you'd better come soon,' Fred
said. 'We'll have to sell the house, I'm afraid.'</p>
<p>'Will you?' said Munden quite indifferently. 'What rotten
luck!'</p>
<p>But Fred did not mind his selfishness. Quite natural! Everyone
was selfish, except a few divine women like Meg.</p>
<p>But he was truly in that transcendental and disconnected state
of happiness that was a deeper drunkenness, in which there was a
spiritual as well as a physical element.</p>
<p>Munden's bad wine had not affected him at all, nor was he in
any actual truth of the word drunk: he was like a bird in a
golden cage, soaked in sun, and the golden cage was Alice Van
Renn.</p>
<p>So, exactly as though he <i>were</i> drunk, he heard himself
talking.</p>
<p>He knew nothing about literature but said a lot. 'Hope I
haven't hurt any feelings--'</p>
<p>'Oh, not at all,' said Pargiter, smiling in rather a sickly
fashion. 'I must be getting on, Munden, I'm afraid--'</p>
<p>And Rose didn't make things any better by saying in a very
hearty way:</p>
<p>'I assure you, Mr. Delaney, Pargiter's stories are grand
stuff. Simply grand. As good as any we have.'</p>
<p>But Fred didn't care. After a brandy or two by himself in the
smoking-room he hailed a taxi again and started off for
Victoria.</p>
<p>He had reached a condition now when he was soaked in nothing
but his Alice. He had forgotten altogether his wife, his
children, his house, his nonexistent tenants, the terrible state
of the world--everything alive or dead. Soon he would be in the
train alone with Alice. Because he was so sure that in a short
while he would have her beautifully in his strong arms he need
not now do anything but look at her, seated opposite to her,
enjoying to the very last fragment of physical enjoyment her
loveliness. How he would feel on Monday morning, or even on
Sunday morning, did not now concern him at all. Nor any rules of
equity or honour. On the other hand, although he was not at this
moment ethical he <i>was</i> extraordinarily benevolent. There
was nothing he would not give away (if he had it) to anybody
(except, of course, Alice). 'He loved every dog and wished that
every dog should love him.' He sat back, one knee over the other,
his hat tilted to one side, humming a tune.</p>
<p>The taxi-man, looking at him through his little glass,
reckoned on a handsome tip, and his reckoning was not
disappointed.</p>
<p>Arrived at Victoria he saw that he was a trifle early. He knew
just where it was that Alice was to meet him--by the bookstall on
the Dover platform. He looked at the bookstall and wondered, as
he had often wondered before, why it was that bookstalls never
had anything that anyone wanted to read.</p>
<p>He looked at the people around him and felt for them a loving
and tolerant benevolence. A porter offered to carry his bag. He
told him that he did not need him yet. Why had he not hired a
magnificent Daimler and carried Alice away with him in that? It
was Alice's suggestion that they should travel by train. She said
that it seemed to her more romantic. He had thought, when she
said that, that she had looked at him a little quizzically. But
then she <i>was</i> an ironic woman--an ironic modern woman of
the world who knew just what she was about. If she hadn't known
he would have felt a good deal of a cad.</p>
<p>He beamed upon the world. The holiday season was well and
truly laid, but there were many anxious women and hustled men and
one or two casual indifferent beauties. There was also one family
that made him, against all his will and intention, feel
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A stout father, a stout mother, two small boys, a smaller
girl. They were going on to the Continent and were crazily
excited about it. The stout father produced at the barrier his
packet of tickets, and while the collector looked at them he
marshalled his two small boys and his smaller daughter as a hen
its chickens. They passed through the barrier, and at once, as
though that barrier had been a desperate danger before which they
had had to summon all their courage, now they broke into
movements and noises of joy and freedom. The stout father, his
daughter's hand tightly held, moved along, his hat a little on
the back of his head, as though France would be irretrievably
gone did he not hasten. Fred wished he hadn't seen them. Oh, well
. . . both mother and father were well past the romantic age!</p>
<p>Then he saw Alice. She was standing, a little beyond the
bookstall, looking at him. For a moment he stared back at her,
lost in wonder at her beauty. She was dressed in dove-grey like a
bride. He had expected that she would be in good serviceable
tweeds. He went up to her and held out his hand.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Alice,' he said, grinning all over his face.</p>
<p>'Hullo, Fred,' she said.</p>
<p>'I was afraid you might be late. . . . But of course I knew
you wouldn't be really.'</p>
<p>She cleared her throat.</p>
<p>'No. I'm a very punctual person.'</p>
<p>'I must get the tickets. I won't be a minute. Where are your
things? I'll find a porter.'</p>
<p>He was so deliriously excited that he wasn't sure of his
words. So insane was he that he had almost said 'Pargiter'
instead of 'Porter.'</p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>'No, Fred. Wait a minute.'</p>
<p>He knew at once that something had happened. He looked at
her.</p>
<p>'What's the matter?'</p>
<p>'I'm not coming.'</p>
<p>He was furious. The blood pounded into his face.</p>
<p>'By God, you are.'</p>
<p>'No, I'm not, Fred. I can't.'</p>
<p>'What do you mean--you can't?' He snorted and resembled, had
he but known it, an indignant and frustrated calf.</p>
<p>She didn't, for a moment, answer.</p>
<p>'Is your old mother ill?'</p>
<p>'No. My old mother is <i>not</i> ill.'</p>
<p>'Are you ill yourself, then?'</p>
<p>'No--I'm not ill either. I'm simply not coming.'</p>
<p>'But you are--even though I have to carry you.' His voice was
suddenly soft, bewildered and touching. 'Listen. You <i>must</i>
come, Alice. You promised most faithfully. You swore that you
wouldn't go back on it. I know you're not that sort--the sort
that plays with a man. We've been friends for so long--'</p>
<p>She looked at him as though she really loved him. Her
beautiful eyes brimmed with tears. She shook, gently,
remorsefully, her head.</p>
<p>'I can't come with you, Fred. I was married this morning.'</p>
<p>He stood staring, his tongue passing over his lips. He took
off for a moment his hat and then put it on again.</p>
<p>'Good joke you've played on me,' he said at last.</p>
<p>'No, I haven't.' She looked at him more kindly than she had
ever done. 'It certainly isn't a joke. Come in here a minute.'
She pointed to the Third Class Refreshment Room. 'If you'll let
me explain.'</p>
<p>'Who's the happy husband?' he said at last. He was glaring at
her and his fingers were moving as though he would really delight
to wring her neck. This way murders are committed, but not by
people like Fred Delaney and Alice Van Renn in Victoria Station.
At any rate not to-day.</p>
<p>'Harry Bartlett,' Alice said.</p>
<p>'Good God . . . Bartlett! I might have guessed.'</p>
<p>'It's not as bad as you think,' she suggested.</p>
<p>'As bad as <i>I</i> think? All I know is you've tricked and
teased and made a blasted fool of me.' He looked at her with a
true schoolboy savagery. 'I'll pay you out for this.' Then he
added (and she saw that he was really not far from angry,
frustrated, passionate, shamefaced tears): 'No, I won't. Of
course not. Men are always being fooled by women. It's no new
thing. Only I never thought that <i>you</i> would--I thought that
you were fond of me--in a sort of way.'</p>
<p>'I <i>am</i> fond of you,' she said. 'That's why I've done
this.'</p>
<p>People were pushing past. Some looked at them inquisitively.
It was not a good place for so tender an interview.</p>
<p>'Come in here. Please, Fred. I can explain better.'</p>
<p>'Where's Bartlett?' Fred asked.</p>
<p>'Waiting--in the Jermyn Street flat.'</p>
<p>'Afraid to meet me, I suppose.'</p>
<p>'Not in the least. He wanted to come. I told him I'd manage
better without him.'</p>
<p>She led the way into the refreshment room. Young men, one very
ancient clergyman and two elderly spidery women were standing at
the counter as though performing some ancient sacrificial rite,
and indeed the tea-urns and the glass pyramids guarding the
sandwiches looked like important Druidical survivals.</p>
<p>They sat down at a little table and ordered coffee for
decency's sake.</p>
<p>He was taking it more severely than she had expected. She had
known him always gay, full of humour, buoyant. He was now a man
she had never seen before. His pride was desperately hurt, and
whereas a woman in such a situation would be thinking more of
revenge than of self-humiliation, Fred could see nothing but that
he'd been 'made a complete ass of.'</p>
<p>'You needn't have done it just to-day,' he said. 'You might
have let us have our week-end.'</p>
<p>'So I meant to. Then, a few weeks ago, I found that I was
falling in love with you. First time in my rotten life. And what
are <i>you</i> to fall in love with, Fred? Stout, middle-aged, a
man who has loved dozens of women before and will love dozens
again. But none of that would have mattered perhaps, because I
was beginning to feel pretty reckless, if it hadn't been that you
love your wife. Love her? I've never known a husband love a wife
as you love Meg. You're for ever talking about her, for ever
thinking of her. That you want to sleep with other women means
nothing. So do all healthy normal men. Of course they <i>want</i>
to! Lots of them don't do it because they are afraid of their
wives or their neighbours or their careers or something. But they
don't love their wives as you love Meg. So what chance is there
for <i>me?</i> One week-end with you and where might I not have
been? Would I lead that hellish life of waiting for letters that
don't come, listening to telephones that don't ring, hearing a
step that isn't there? Not I. Right up to a week ago I thought
I'd risk it. I wobbled this way and that. Mother was after me to
marry, of course--neither of us has a penny-farthing. But she
hates Bartlett and loves you, so she couldn't bear me to have
anything to do with either of you. Harry has money, of course,
but he <i>detests</i> Mama--simply loathes her. So I knew that if
I went off with you for a night or two it might lead to personal
suffering, and I've suffered enough in my young life already. If
I married Harry it would mean that I should have, more or less,
to desert Mother--on the other hand, she'd have enough to live on
for the rest of her days. There were <i>other</i> suitors. One
old boy with money who unfortunately revolts me. Two or three
young ones with nothing but debts. Harry was really the only
solution.'</p>
<p>'But you don't love him,' Fred said. He was recovering ever so
slightly. She had flattered him. What she had said about Meg was
true.</p>
<p>'Not in the least. But he's got his points. He's
long-suffering, which he needs to be with a girl like me. He'll
never change and, what is best of all, he's incapable of
suffering. I don't <i>mean</i> to treat him badly, but I'm really
so rotten through and through that you never can tell. And it's a
great comfort to me to know that he's too stupid ever to be
hurt.'</p>
<p>She looked at him. She held out her hand.</p>
<p>'Forgive me. I'm not worth your troubling about. And I think
you're the luckiest man alive.'</p>
<p>'Lucky?'</p>
<p>'Yes, because you and your wife love one another as you do. I
think she's swell--a lot sweller than you are--but <i>you're</i>
not so bad.'</p>
<p>('Meg <i>is</i> swell,' he thought, and began to his own
surprise to resent the thought of her weekend.)</p>
<p>'I'm forgiven,' Alice said. 'That's good. And now you've got
to do something for me. You're to go straight to Mama and tell
her that I'm married to Harry, and am not coming back.'</p>
<p>He stared at her. All he wanted now was to get away. It would
be horrible this week-end without Meg, but somehow it would have
to be endured. He felt flat and tired and quite desperately
Puritanical. However, he would certainly <i>not</i> see old Mrs.
Van Renn.</p>
<p>'See your mother! I should think not!'</p>
<p>'Oh, please! . . . You're the only person in the whole world
who possibly can. She's always been secretly in love with you.
You're exactly her ideal of what a real man should be.'</p>
<p>'She hates me. Anyway, she's always very rude to me.'</p>
<p>'That's to hide her feelings,' Alice went on. 'Listen, Fred:
if you will do this it will be the first thing any man's ever
done for me. Not that <i>I'm</i> anything, but I'll say to
myself: "Fred Delaney has so magnificently played the game that
it's the least I can do to be decent to Harry." Because it
<i>will</i> be difficult sometimes, you know.'</p>
<p>'What do you want me to do?' Fred growled. He liked the idea
of his own nobility. After all, what was a quarter of an hour
with that old woman compared with his own new sense of heroism?
It was certainly many years since he had felt so virtuous.</p>
<p>'I want you to go straight to her now in Half Moon Street and
to tell her that I'm married to Harry. I've brought a letter you
can give her. It will make the whole difference if <i>you</i>
tell her.'</p>
<p>'Yes. She'll feel that we've <i>both</i> been damnably
treated.'</p>
<p>'Exactly.'</p>
<p>'And so we have.'</p>
<p>'Well--<i>you</i> have. Mother's much better off really. Harry
will make her a decent allowance and she won't have me always
coming in and out. When you tell her you can pretend to be
absolutely furious.'</p>
<p>'And so I <i>am</i> furious!'</p>
<p>'Oh no, you're not. Already you're relieved. You're thinking
of Meg.'</p>
<p>They both got up.</p>
<p>'Pay for the coffee. And here's the letter.'</p>
<p>As she got into the taxi-cab she turned round and said in a
very low sweet voice:</p>
<p>'All to-night I'll be thinking of you.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He made his taxi drive about for a considerable time before he
went to see Mrs. Van Renn.</p>
<p>He sat there, seeing nothing and thinking of nothing. He was
miserable, ashamed, forlorn, humiliated. And somewhere, beneath
all this, a feeling of intense relief was stirring.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Renn looked as usual like a sick monkey. Her old
fingers were stained with nicotine.</p>
<p>'What do you want?' she said. 'Why are you here? Alice is away
for the week-end.'</p>
<p>'She's not,' he said. 'She has asked me to give you this
letter.'</p>
<p>The old woman took it and, huddled in her chair, read it. Then
she looked up at him with a face of almost piteous dismay.</p>
<p>'Why didn't you stop her?'</p>
<p>'Stop her! I hadn't the least idea of it.'</p>
<p>'Where did she give you this?'</p>
<p>'She asked me to meet her. It was at Victoria Station, as a
matter of fact.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Renn gave him a sharp look.</p>
<p>'Oh, was it?'</p>
<p>Then he thought she was going to cry. Her wrinkled lips moved
and twisted. She threw up her head derisively, tried to speak and
could not.</p>
<p>'So that's over,' she said at last, and tore the letter into
fragments which fluttered to the floor.</p>
<p>'Well, can't you say something? It's rather rough on
<i>you,</i> isn't it?' Then she muttered: 'That idiot!'</p>
<p>'She asked me to tell you,' Fred began, 'that she was sure it
was the best thing. She's fond of Bartlett. The sort of life you
were both leading wasn't good enough. You'll be free and
independent. She hopes you'll come and stay with them. She's
coming to see you very soon.'</p>
<p>'She could have told me all this herself.'</p>
<p>'She thinks you'd have both lost your tempers.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Renn got up.</p>
<p>'All right. . . . It can't have been pleasant for you either.
I won't. . . . It doesn't. . . .' She turned on him quite
furiously. 'Can't you see I don't want anybody to . . .? Don't
look at me like that. To marry such a fool . . . Good-bye.
Good-bye. Come again some time--although Alice won't be here
now.'</p>
<p>He said something and went.</p>
<p>He walked in the Park. He couldn't for the moment face the
empty house. The week-end when he knew where Meg was. . . . Why
had he been so tolerant, so lazy--about her, about himself? He
had never before loved Meg so dearly as now when he walked under
the bare trees, kicking the leaves with his foot.</p>
<p>At last he walked slowly home, with a sigh let himself into
the house. It was as still as a morgue. He could feel all the
rooms above him pressing on his head with their undeserved
emptiness. He would have a <i>ghastly</i> week-end! He pushed the
door back, then stood staring.</p>
<p>Then, his face grinning with happiness, he rushed forward.</p>
<p>'Meg! Meg, darling! . . . By all that's marvellous!'</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>THIS DARK NOVEMBER DAY . . .</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>And now, early on this November afternoon, the little Park is
really forgotten, unseen, for the yellow fog has almost obscured
it. Almost, not quite. You can still walk with comparative safety
if you keep your eye on the railings which are visible like
stakes in a marsh. The Piccadilly lights are shining, and quite
suddenly, outside Hatchett's and all the way to Burlington
Arcade, the fog vanishes, revealing a space of blue sunlit sky,
some rakish chimneys and the cakes and buns behind the windows at
the end of Old Bond Street. Then, as though angry at its
carelessness, the fog sweeps down and is like wads of yellow
flannel underclothing. The road is coated with a thin filmy mud
and the cars stagger and hoot, hoot and stagger. An old
gentleman's pocket is picked just outside Burlington House. . .
.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kitty Delaney is giving Millie Pake luncheon in Hatchett's
restaurant and is feeling very dejected indeed. Her reasons for
dejection are--this fog, her father at breakfast has announced,
finally, definitely, that the house is to be sold, Millie Pake
looks shabby and hungry, and--last of all--she, Kitty, is this
very afternoon going to say farewell to the whole of the Foster
episode. She feels, in fact, very lonely.</p>
<p>Hatchett's, which is a kindly and human restaurant, has all
its lights on, but you cannot forget, all the same, that
Piccadilly is in the process of being villainously strangled by
the fog just above your head.</p>
<p>'When we were girls, Helen and I,' Millie said, 'I can
remember very well that a real London fog seemed the most
exciting and adventurous thing in the world. Of course we were
never allowed out alone, but even to run for two minutes into the
Square was dreadfully exciting. Dear, you won't think me
disgraceful, will you, but I'm afraid I simply can't eat any more
of this delicious veal.'</p>
<p>'No, dear, of course not.'</p>
<p>Kitty was finding, once again, that it is very difficult to
help people who are proud. She had also learnt by this time that
it is only too easy to help people who are not quite proud
enough.</p>
<p>Millie Pake's rings were gone. They had been such beautiful
ones. Millie's hands were beautiful but dreadfully thin.</p>
<p>'Millie, where are your rings?'</p>
<p>Millie, her old head trembling a little as it did sometimes,
looked Kitty full in the eye.</p>
<p>'I've pawned them. I won't lie to you, and I won't take a
penny from you, dear. Not a penny. After all if things became
really bad I could always ask my brother, although I must admit
he doesn't like being asked very much. There's no need to ask
anybody. There's some money coming in next week and really I
ought to be very happy in my bed-sitting-room. It's very cosy
indeed with my pictures and a plant or two. But the fact is,
Kitty dear, I've been spoilt by the Charles Street house. No
place will ever be to me what that was, partly because I was
there with Helen I suppose. No, I can't pretend I'm happy where I
am. In Charles Street I seemed to be protected. I don't mean by
God. Of course He is <i>always</i> looking after me--but where I
am now I seem to meet so many old ladies who are in the same
circumstances as myself or worse. And I'll admit to you, Kitty,
that it <i>is</i> depressing. What <i>is</i> depressing is that
for most of them no one cares in the least whether they live or
die. That is really dreadful to me. When one is old and poor
one's a nuisance. There's no doubt of it. And I don't think the
old ladies would mind their poverty and aches and pains one
little bit if there was only someone who didn't think them a
nuisance. Of course no one has any time, what with the state the
world's in and so on. In Charles Street, Helen and I were always
perfectly happy because of you dear people and I'm afraid we
didn't think of anyone else much. I think it was that day that I
found poor Smoke--that was the day I realized how wrong Helen and
I had been not thinking of others more. And there was poor Claude
of course. Do tell me more about Claude.'</p>
<p>'There isn't much more to tell. Mother has been to see him
every day and he's quite well now. I don't think that horrid man
of his will touch him again. He's terrified of Mother. But poor
Claude's so dreadfully frightened all the same. He only seems to
feel safe when he's with us.'</p>
<p>Millie nodded her head. 'I know how it is. That Charles Street
house is a kind of refuge.'</p>
<p>Kitty had said nothing to Millie about its sale. That would be
too dreadful. She looked now at the odd little figure in the
funny hat and old green cape and vowed that something
<i>should</i> be done. But what? They, the Delaneys, would
themselves be soon on the street!</p>
<p>Millie, however, was immensely cheered up by the luncheon.
Kitty took her back to her bed-sitting-room in a taxi. She left
her warm and cosy, reading <i>Middlemarch</i> and laughing a
great deal at the jokes in the <i>Punch</i> that Kitty had given
her. Her eyes were as bright as stars, and her little round, but
now lined, aristocratic countenance had that look of sweetness,
irony and half-impertinence that was especially hers.</p>
<p>'Good-bye, Kitty darling. I've had a most lovely time!'</p>
<p>But, still, something <i>had</i> to be done!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She had written a line to the elder Foster saying that she
would come 'to say good-bye.' She named a choice of days and
received a strange reply. In a dreadfully common handwriting was
a quotation from one of the poems of Ella Wheeler Wilcox to the
effect that the sun rises in the morning, sets at night, and that
all the birds and flowers rejoice thereat. Underneath was
written: 'Thursday 3.30 O.K. by me.'</p>
<p>Lucy Foster admitted her and she noticed at once several
things. First, that all the vulgar oil-paintings had vanished
from the walls. The faint colours of the two young men were now
beautifully clear. Secondly, that the couch and screen were gone
and the room seemed larger. Thirdly, that instead of the horribly
impressive tea of her first visit there were now on the table
only a teapot, <i>one</i> teacup, milk and sugar and a plate of
buttered toast.</p>
<p>Then she saw that Foster was standing leaning on a stick and
grinning at her. This was the first time that she had seen him
from head to toe. He was very impressive with his white hair, red
face, broad shoulders, strong stomach, heavy thighs. He was
wearing a buttonhole and a country-looking suit of black and grey
stripes. He looked cheerful, clean, healthy, vulgar.</p>
<p>Lucy Foster at once said, rather primly: 'You'll excuse me,
Miss Delaney, I'm sure. I've a visit to make if you'll excuse
me.' Then she went out. He shook hands with Kitty but didn't ask
her to sit down.</p>
<p>'Where's Alton?' she asked.</p>
<p>'Oh, didn't you know?' His eyes never left her face. 'He's
been gone a fortnight.'</p>
<p>'Gone?'</p>
<p>'Yes. He's on the French Riviera now with Mrs. Bettison
Stuart, a lady twenty years older than himself, a widow, rich,
who fell in love with him at Zanti's. He's her secretary.'</p>
<p>'Oh dear, oh dear,' said Kitty.</p>
<p>'Yes--oh dear, oh dear. It's unromantic, isn't it?' He went
on: 'You'll have noticed several things, I expect. My paintings
have gone from the wall. You'll be glad of that. No more painting
for me. I've better things to do. Also there's only one cup on
the table--that's symbolic.'</p>
<p>'Why?' she asked, smiling.</p>
<p>'I'm not asking you to tea. You're to stay five--at most
ten--minutes.'</p>
<p>'Good-bye then,' she said, holding out her hand and
laughing.</p>
<p>'Oh, not so quick as that,' he said, pushing a chair towards
her with one hand. 'We'll never meet again. We may as well have
our five minutes.'</p>
<p>'Why will we never meet again?' Kitty asked, sitting down.</p>
<p>'Because I'm nearly well. A bit stiff after lying down so
long. That's all. You cured me. Oh, I <i>had</i> my accident all
right. My back was bad for a long time--but after that when I
really <i>was</i> better there didn't seem any reason for my
getting up. Alton earned enough to feed and shelter me. Lucy
looked after me, I was amused with my painting, I had a visitor
or two--no trouble. A grand life. But then <i>you</i> came in and
the moment I saw you I cried to myself: "Why, there's women in
the world, thousands, millions of them, moving about, laughing,
waiting to be made love to, old though I am--and I wasting my
time!" And that's why <i>you</i> mustn't stay--because I'll be
making love to you. And it won't do. You like me a bit. You know
you do. In spite of my white hair. And you know nothing about
men. Nothing at all. So it's good-bye once and for ever--and
thank you very much.'</p>
<p>'But I'm not frightened of you in the least,' she said,
smiling at him. 'And it's quite true I <i>do</i> like you.'</p>
<p>He looked at her very fixedly. Then he shook his head.</p>
<p>'You <i>would</i> be frightened of me. If there was another
cup on that table--about an hour from now you wouldn't like me at
all. No. Get along, Miss Delaney. You've brought me to life
again. That's a good deed, I suppose.'</p>
<p>He held out his hand. She took it. They stood very close to
one another.</p>
<p>'It's funny,' he said. 'All these years I've loathed those
paintings on the wall. You've made me like them. Another thing
that's funny. You're in the grand world, have thousands of swell
friends. It has needed the obscure Fosters in this obscure room
to start you on life. And now you're started don't think life's
anything but coarse and strong and vulgar and a bit savage,
because that's what it is. It doesn't care a damn about you, life
doesn't, but you can get from it some perfectly swell
moments--and by God, I'm going to have a few more before I go.
Look after yourself. Give me a kiss for Alton's sake if not for
mine.'</p>
<p>She kissed him and he held her tightly, kissing her eyes, her
mouth, her throat.</p>
<p>He murmured: 'It's grand to be on my feet again.'</p>
<p>Then he took her by the hand and led her to the door.</p>
<p>Before she took her hand from his she said:</p>
<p>'You know, if you're ever ill again or anything--'</p>
<p>He broke out: 'Oh, for God's sake! I don't want you as a
<i>nurse. . . .</i> You can send me a photograph sometime if you
like.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meanwhile Bullock was having <i>his</i> adventures. In fact
the climax of his life, as he wrote in his Journal, jumped up at
him in the very middle of this twisting, turning,
poke-saltpetre-up-your-nostrils fog. The climax of his life! That
shows how very young he still is, but for anyone as quiet and
humorous as Bullock was and is, it means something. At the very
moment when Kitty Delaney was embracing Alton Foster's father,
Bullock Delaney was falling, his head in a stranger's
stomach--but this is how it happened.</p>
<p>First, on that foggy day Bullock went and had luncheon
with--but that, too, had better be kept as a surprise for later.
In any case this luncheon was to make all the difference to the
Delaney family.</p>
<p>Then, about half-past three he climbed into a taxi and told
the man to go to Borden Street. This wasn't so easy, and they
bumped and blundered and stopped and hooted while the lamps
looked at them like the eyes of wild beasts out of a yellow
jungle, a bell sounded somewhere like a foghorn, and you could
almost hear the waves of the fog swish, swish against the flimsy
barriers of the thread-paper houses.</p>
<p>At last they were there, though, and Bullock ran up the narrow
smelly stairs eager to take his young beloved out to tea,
although they mustn't venture in this weather further than
Shaftesbury Avenue, that mingling of theatres, cheap shirts and
collars, and the Trocadero. He found the door locked. He banged
the old knocker that was in the shape of the west door of
Canterbury Cathedral. He knocked furiously. The fog crept up the
stairs and fingered in a stealing, inquisitive way the peeling
wallpaper. At last Coventry's voice could be heard quite clearly
from the other side of the door:</p>
<p>'Who is it?'</p>
<p>'Delaney--Stephen Delaney.'</p>
<p>The door was opened cautiously and Captain Nicholas looked
out.</p>
<p>'Come in then. I was wanting to see you.'</p>
<p>Bullock entered and found the room in shapeless
disorder--empty whisky bottles, empty syphons, shirts and
underclothes on the floor, Lizzie kneeling packing, one of the
sporting prints, its glass shattered, on the carpet near the
bathroom. Another sporting print crooked on its string, bedroom
door open, and there in complete disarray, most astonishing of
all, tilting on a chair near the window, a stout streaky-faced
gentleman, his waistcoat unbuttoned, bald-headed save for a few
wet black hairs, his round red loose mouth open. He was
apparently protesting at something. Nicholas was standing in his
shirtsleeves, in one hand a half-empty glass, in the other a roll
of soiled-looking collars. Lizzie gave one look upwards and when
she saw who it was went on with her packing again. Captain
Nicholas was a little drunk, but not very. He went quickly to the
door and locked it.</p>
<p>'Leaving?' asked Bullock.</p>
<p>'Leaving is right. It's a bit of luck your coming in. Lizzie
said you might. I would have telephoned, only you don't know
who's listening.'</p>
<p>'What's the matter?' asked Bullock, feeling that the room was
extraordinarily small. He supposed that it was the stout
gentleman in the window that made it seem so thoroughly
overcrowded.</p>
<p>'The matter?' asked Captain Nicholas gaily. He seemed to be in
excellent spirits. 'The matter is that I shall be in gaol
to-night if I don't get a move on.'</p>
<p>The stout gentleman began to shout, 'You don't leave this room
until you pay . . .' and so on.</p>
<p>'Oh, I forgot,' said Nicholas. 'I ought to introduce you. But
why should I? Shut up, you son of a bitch, or I'll--'</p>
<p>The stout man rose and stood, swaying a little on both legs.
He stared at Nicholas as though fascinated.</p>
<p>'You're not taking Lizzie?'</p>
<p>'No. I'm <i>not</i> taking Lizzie. This is where we bid one
another an eternal farewell. Here. Get up, Liz. I mustn't wait
another second. This fog is God's own gift to His erring son.
There. Close that bag. That's as much as I want.'</p>
<p>'If you don't pay me every farthing--' shouted the stout
man.</p>
<p>'Every farthing! That's good!' cried Captain Nicholas. 'When
I've just enough to get me across the Channel.'</p>
<p>'I'll inform--'</p>
<p>'You can jolly well inform whom you like,' said Nicholas
cheerfully.</p>
<p>The stout man advanced and caught Bullock by the arm.</p>
<p>'I charge you, sir, whoever you may be, to assist me in
calling the police.'</p>
<p>'The devil you do!' cried Nicholas.</p>
<p>After that things happened swiftly. Nicholas turned and caught
the stout man a splendid blow straight on the jaw. The stout man
tumbled forward, embraced Bullock, and they both fell together,
catching the tablecloth as they fell. On to the floor went the
stout man, Bullock, bottles and glasses.</p>
<p>When Bullock had disentangled himself from the stout man's
waistcoat and was on his feet again, he saw that Captain
Nicholas, his coat on, was standing there very calmly, bidding a
long farewell to his daughter. His hands were on her
shoulders.</p>
<p>'There. Leave him. He's all right. And now, Liz, my darling,
good-bye. Not au revoir. Really good-bye. You don't like me any
more, but you did once, and I may truly say that you're the only
human I've ever loved or ever will love. I hand you over to this
young man, who's so good that he ought to be in a fairy story.
You can trust him. He has no imagination whatever. Put me right
out of your mind. We've had some good times together and seen the
world. I don't regret a damned thing.'</p>
<p>And with that, snatching his bag, he was away into the fog,
never to be seen again by his once loving daughter.</p>
<p>She, Bullock saw, was now kneeling by the stout gentleman and
bathing his forehead with her handkerchief and water that dripped
from the tablecloth. The gentleman opened his eyes and said:
'Another one, miss, please. Just like the last.' A furious
disgust for this filthy room and everything in it seized Bullock.
He caught Lizzie quite fiercely by the arm and dragged her to her
feet.</p>
<p>'Come. Put on your hat and coat. It's beastly here.
Disgusting. He's all right. . . . Leave him, leave him!'</p>
<p>In his impatience he shook her, and like someone in a dream
she obeyed him. She went into her room, came out dressed for the
street.</p>
<p>The stout man was now in a chair; he was feeling his jaw,
while his head swayed. About him was all the débris of a ruined
adventurer. His round eyes watched them. He said not a word as
they left the room. In the street the fog had miraculously
cleared, as though indeed Captain Nicholas had collected it all
in his hand and carried it off with him.</p>
<p>And, as often happens in London, instead of the fog there was
a dim sea-green mist. London had suddenly, as it were, gone under
water. Borden Street is no beauty as streets go, but she was a
beauty for a moment now. The sweet-shop with the heavy pile of
chocolates, of coconut icing, of white and pink sugar, the door
of the 'Stag' public-house, the three houses in a row with white
steps and faint pink window-curtains, the railings in front of
the old, packed, grey and green churchyard that might have
sheltered the broom and tatters of Poor Jo himself, the London
mingling of stale beer and evening papers and sliding gratings
and stealing cats--all swam now in this green under-sea mystery
with some gay orange wisps of cloud caught in the crooked
chimneys and a man's voice singing from inside the 'Stag.'</p>
<p>In Shaftesbury Avenue they found a cab and Bullock told it to
drive to Westminster. Inside the cab he sat with his arm round
her. She shivered once or twice but said nothing.</p>
<p>'You knew it was coming,' he said. 'We both did. Don't worry
about him. You couldn't be with him any more. He knew that.'</p>
<p>At last she said: 'I'd have gone if he'd wanted me.'</p>
<p>'I'll be so good to you. Did you hear what he said to
you--that I've no imagination? Well, if that's true--and I don't
think it is--I can be faithful and love you for ever.'</p>
<p>'No one loves for ever,' Lizzie said.</p>
<p>'Oh yes, they do. And they love one another more and more
because of all the things they've done together.'</p>
<p>'No one loves for ever,' she repeated. He held her closer; she
leaned her cheek against his, then turned and kissed him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Westminster house of Fanny Carlisle he rang the bell.
They stood together on the steps hand in hand. The woman who
opened the door was the woman Bullock had seen before.</p>
<p>'Miss Lizzie! Oh, Miss Lizzie!' she cried.</p>
<p>'I've come back, Janet,' Lizzie said, then turned and kissed
Bullock and walked into the house.</p>
<p>'Just tell Mrs. Carlisle,' Bullock said, 'that I've done what
I said I'd do.'</p>
<p>Then he walked away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The fog came back about six o'clock, having, we may suppose,
seen Captain Nicholas safe across the Channel. With its wet slimy
tentacles writhing up and down, in and out, it settled down upon
London. Outside the Charles Street house, about ten o'clock, it
was like a wall of thick, stifling grey-black ectoplasm. Inside
the Charles Street house the Delaney family sat in no very gay
frame of mind.</p>
<p>Bullock, his little body curled up like a ball at the end of
the sofa, was reading <i>The Hillyars and the Burtons.</i> Kitty,
her long legs stretched out in front of her, was looking into the
fire. Meg, with Endless asleep against her shoe, was reading
<i>Time and Tide.</i> Fred, looking rather too stout and
choleric, had his chair tilted forward and he was staring in
front of him. The William and Mary clock was ticking, Endless was
snoring with that snore so peculiarly human that it makes you
stare at your dog with discomfort and doubt the survival of
personality after death, the coals were tit-titting in the
fire.</p>
<p>'Remember Snails and Oysters,' Fred Delaney said suddenly, and
then, as they all looked up, he remarked, yawning: 'I only wanted
to attract your different attentions. I would remark that this is
one of the few evenings we've all been gathered together in one
room for months--and I'd like to say I'm wondering whether you're
aware that tomorrow morning as ever is I sign the agreement for
the final and absolute slaughter, destruction, murder of this
house. And that, once it is gone, we will be the Joyful Delaneys
no longer, but wanderers on the face of the earth. And that not
only is the house going, but London too--very, very shortly--and
after that the British Empire, and after that the Planet, and
after that--well, the First Cause will have to start planning all
over again.' He stopped. He loved, he had to admit it, the sound
of his own voice, for he was at heart a poet and all poets love
the sound of their own voices, even when they are very squeaky
ones.</p>
<p>Fred Delaney had been pulling himself away from his dream, the
dream that he had in the Club that afternoon seated in one of
those big armchairs in front of the fire. An extraordinary dream
because of the vividness of its detail. He had been at some party
and with him had been his old friend Reeves, and Reeves had been
drunk. This in itself was absurd, because Reeves had never been
drunk in his life. He had walked into the street with Reeves. It
was one of the most horrid of London days, a wild freakish wind
blowing, gusts of rain, and the road slimy with mud. The traffic,
as it does sometimes on a windy day, seemed to be moving at a
furious, almost insane rate. Well, Reeves had said goodbye and
started to walk down the street. Then, quite unexpectedly, he had
fallen flat on his face all amongst a group of playing children,
and Fred had seen how his mousy-grey-white mackintosh had been
caught by the wind and blown in little fantastic gusts above his
recumbent body. The children were jumping about him and beating
him with little spades. Fred was about to start out to help him,
but suddenly Reeves got up and began to run again. Fred could see
him as he reached the corner of the street, where there was a
great deal of traffic. Suddenly Reeves stepped right into the
middle of the road and fell flat on to his face again, and there
he lay while the traffic roared past him, missing his body by a
shadow's breadth, and especially a bicyclist, a boy bending
forward on his machine and looking ahead with furious intensity,
who flew round the corner and made Reeves' mackintosh rise as
though in protest. It would never do to let Reeves lie there--he
would be killed at any moment--so Fred ran madly down the street,
crying out 'Snails and Oysters!' 'Snails and Oysters!'--which
words seem to contain some most fearful warning. But when he got
to the corner of the street there was no sign of Reeves anywhere;
the wind caught Fred so abominably that, filled with fear, he
clung on to the wall close behind him. Then he woke up.</p>
<p>A silly, meaningless dream, but it had greatly oppressed him,
so he talked to forget it.</p>
<p>'So you see, this is really our last night in this house--the
last night anyway that it belongs to us.'</p>
<p>Bullock began to speak. 'All the same, Father--'</p>
<p>But Fred Delaney cut him short.</p>
<p>'I don't want any arguments. The thing's done and settled.
There's nothing more to be said.'</p>
<p>'I saw Marjorie Blandin to-day,' Meg began rather dreamily,
'and she said why don't <i>I</i> start taking people from the
country and introducing them to Duchesses? She says of course
it's boring but really <i>is</i> paying, and with all the people
Larry knows and my own fine and handsome presence . . .' She was
thinking: 'I can see quite clearly from his last letter that he
will never forgive me for keeping him waiting at the station like
that. <i>Never.</i> It was exactly the thing that in the old days
he never could stand. So perhaps it's all for the best. Because
it's clear that he doesn't believe my reasons either. He thinks
all that about poor Claude made up, and if he doesn't believe me,
what hope would there ever have been?'</p>
<p>Aloud she said:</p>
<p>'The people really weighing on my mind are Claude Willoughby
and Millie Pake. If only we could do something for <i>them,</i>
get them out of the awful places where they are! If only we could
afford to have them here! Oh, but I forgot. There won't be any
<i>here</i> after to-morrow morning. What <i>are</i> we going to
do, Fred?'</p>
<p>'Of course we'll have enough to live on--in Surbiton or
somewhere like that.'</p>
<p>'Surbiton!' Meg cried before she could prevent herself.</p>
<p>Fred gave her a malicious grin.</p>
<p>'It needn't be <i>actually</i> Surbiton, of course, but that
sort of place. Kitty will marry. Bullock will write for a living
and not merely for pleasure as he is doing at present. The point
is we shall be a joyful family no longer. We shall all be broken
up.'</p>
<p>Bullock began: 'Wait a minute, Father. I've got
something--'</p>
<p>Fred trampled upon him ruthlessly.</p>
<p>'Yes, I know what you're going to say. Your blessed
novel--it's just about finished. I don't want to hear about it
until it's sold and you've got the money. That will be time
enough.'</p>
<p>'But I wasn't--' Bullock began.</p>
<p>'Oh yes, you were. Now what I <i>mean</i> is that what this
house has given us we ought to keep. It has looked after us for
hundreds of years and bound us all together. We must keep that
bond. We must be a family still. I want--I want--'</p>
<p>And then an awful thing happened. They all saw with horror
that Fred's lip was trembling, that he couldn't speak, that he
was on the edge of tears. He got up and went to the mantelpiece
and laid his forehead against it, just under the William and Mary
clock.</p>
<p>He saw with fearful distinctness Reeves' body lying in the
road and the young bicyclist flying round the corner with insane
determination in his eyes.</p>
<p>Then he felt Meg's hand against his cheek.</p>
<p>'Don't take on so, darling. We'll stick together, we four, of
course we will--more than ever now, I think.'</p>
<p>He turned round, laughing, although his eyes were bright with
tears.</p>
<p>'Listen!' he cried. 'Here and now we'll make our procession up
and down the house, saying our farewell to it. We'll light the
Georgian candlesticks and carry them to light our way. We'll go
into every corner, every nook and cranny, saying goodbye to
everything. We'll tell it we couldn't help ourselves, that a
mortgage or borrowing money on it would have been just as bad. It
will understand. They say you can't get fond of a house in
London, that one's only a bird of passage, that everything
changes so constantly. But that's not true. This house has all
the love and fidelity and tenderness of all the finest people who
have lived in it and loved it. And now to-morrow I'm going to
murder it. With my own hand and my fountain-pen I--'</p>
<p>'But, Father--' said Bullock.</p>
<p>'No, my boy. I know what you're going to say. It's no good. We
must face facts.' He lit the silver Georgian candlesticks, and
then in a little procession, Endless leading them, they marched
out.</p>
<p>They started up the stairs. It was as though the house was
listening to their footsteps, was waiting for them. . . .</p>
<p>The street-door bell rang. They all turned on the steps and
stared down into the hall.</p>
<p>'Who <i>can</i> that be at this hour?'</p>
<p>'In this fog too,' said Meg.</p>
<p>The bell rang again, insistently, in a bad temper.</p>
<p>'I think I know who--' said Bullock.</p>
<p>'Caesar has gone home.'</p>
<p>'I'll open it.' Bullock was down the stairs, the door swung
open, letting in thin gusts of fog as though a demon cow were
breathing outside in the street.</p>
<p>But it was not a demon cow. It was old Lord Ragadoon.</p>
<p>He had on his head a cap with a peak and a button to it, over
his shoulders a striped plaid. His bright old eyes peered from
his hairy old face like a robin's from a winter thicket.</p>
<p>He bowed very punctiliously.</p>
<p>'Excuse me,' he said in his rumbling, drumming emphasis. 'May
I have five minutes' business with you?'</p>
<p>The door was closed, they all shook hands.</p>
<p>'This is my wife,' said Fred, 'and this my daughter
Kitty.'</p>
<p>They all trooped back into the drawing-room. Fred still
carried the candles.</p>
<p>'Where's your young woman?' Ragadoon said to Bullock.</p>
<p>'In bed, I hope.'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes--of course. She's only a child.'</p>
<p>Inside the room he looked about him. 'Nice clock you have.' He
bent down and stroked Endless. 'Like dogs.' Then he straightened
himself. 'It's a bit of business,' he said.</p>
<p>'Won't you sit down?' said Meg, showing him a chair.</p>
<p>'Thank ye. Thank ye.' He sat down and, leaning forward,
holding his cap in his hand, addressed them.</p>
<p>'I know it's late. You must forgive that. I'm an old man and
have my own habits. Besides, there's the fog. How I hate fogs!
Yes, ma'am. Fogs would be enough, if there weren't anything else,
to prove that the Deity doesn't know His job. And they ruin
pictures. Let fog get into a decent water-colour drawing . . .
Well, as I was saying, this is business. Your boy Bullock' (he
jerked his thick stumpy finger towards him) 'was taking luncheon
with me to-day, and I expect he's told you although I asked him
not to--'</p>
<p>'No, I haven't told them,' Bullock interrupted. 'I've been
trying to hint, but Father wouldn't listen.'</p>
<p>'Just as well. Just as well,' said the old man. 'Mr. Delaney,
I want to rent the whole of this house, excepting, of course,
your own quarters.'</p>
<p>'You want--what?'</p>
<p>'I want to pay you the rent for this house you require--all
the flats in it except your own. I want to move in immediately
with all my goods and chattels. And when I say my goods and
chattels I say <i>something.</i> I shall live, of course, in my
own flat myself. I propose that you should let the other two
flats to any two friends you may have who are decent,
respectable, trustworthy bodies, but too hard-up, maybe, to pay
the rent themselves. Your boy here told me at luncheon to-day
that you might have such friends. The only proviso I make is that
I shall be wanting to hang my pictures and drawings in every part
of the house, except, of course, your own quarters, and that
therefore your friends who live in the other flats must not
object to having such pictures on their walls, must to some
extent indeed be guardians over them and must be willing at
certain times for visitors to be shown them.' He looked round
upon them all, and then, as they appeared to be speechless, went
on: 'I have it in my mind that my collection of pictures may be
left here, under my will, in perpetuity, as a gift to the nation.
That would ensure, of course, the permanence of this building.
But of that we can speak later.'</p>
<p>He stopped. He twirled his cap round.</p>
<p>Fred at last said: 'Well, I'm damned!'</p>
<p>'You like the idea, Mr. Delaney?' Ragadoon enquired
politely.</p>
<p>'Like it! Like it! It's a dream, a miracle, a phantasmagoria,
a Cinderella Ball, an Elephant and Castle melodrama with the
heroine saved in the nick of time.'</p>
<p>The old man grinned, a peculiar phenomenon, Endless must have
thought, for without warning he barked twice.</p>
<p>'Call it what you like, Mr. Delaney. You must thank your son
and his young woman for this. I'm living in a pigsty and quite
rightly he told me so. I like your son and could teach him
something useful about pictures if he'd learn. . . . And now,
Mrs. Delaney, ma'am, with your very kind permission I'll bid you
farewell. Details can be settled later. But I'm an impatient man
and I'll be moving in by the end of the week.'</p>
<p>He got up, went across to Bullock and laid his hand on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>'See me to the door, young man, and find me a cab.'</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c308" id="c308">CHAPTER VIII</a></h1>
<h2>THE HAPPY MOMENT</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Park, on this last day of the year, dripped water from the
bare trees, oozed water from the sodden soil and veiled its
shabby disgraces with trails of sulky mist.</p>
<p>But the fact that the Park was sulky had nothing to do with
the spirit of Shepherd Market. Although they are always in close
touch with one another, these two, and realize a great deal more
about what is going on in the one or the other than
matter-of-fact people know. (And it's sad, if you think of it,
how very little of what is really going on people who call
themselves matter-of-fact <i>do</i> know.)</p>
<p>There's nothing more unpleasant than the truly whimsical or
I-spy-you're-a-fairy kind of writing, but it is not to be denied
by anybody who has watched life with any closeness that there are
moments, both with places and people, when everything goes very
odd indeed, as it does, for instance, at the end of the second
act of the <i>Meistersinger,</i> in the middle of the
<i>Flegeljahre,</i> at the Eatanswill Election, at that party in
Barchester when the Signora behaved so badly, or at that other
grand private party in Illyria when Malvolio was unable to stop
the ballad-singing.</p>
<p>Some madness of this kind overtook the citizens of Shepherd
Market on that afternoon of the last day of the year of grace
1934. Time passes so swiftly that there are in all probability
few people alive to-day, only four years later, who remember the
ludicrous and whimsical and eccentric scenes of that brief
half-hour. They occurred nevertheless.</p>
<p>It was not an afternoon to encourage end-of-the-year
eccentricities, warm and muggy and dark enough to have lights in
the shops quite early in the afternoon. It was also a Monday, and
everyone knows what a poor day of the week that one is!</p>
<p>Nevertheless here was another year all but dead and gone, and
who knows what glorious things the next year is going to do?</p>
<p>Quite early in the afternoon people were moving about, having
no business apparently to bother with, and the sense of
<i>community,</i> always very strong in the Market, grew with
every minute. Someone's cat had had kittens, a lady had had
twins, a gentleman had won a surprising amount arranging the
winners of football matches, and somebody's daughter in the
Manchester Pantomime had sent word home to say she had engaged
herself to a Manchester business gentleman.</p>
<p>In the dusky lamp-lit afternoon the year seems a little unreal
as it fades towards its close, and men and women stand about as
though they are expecting something. If, at the end of Market
Street, two angels suddenly appeared blowing triumphant trumpets
of gold and crying in ringing voices that the end of the world
had arrived, no one in the Market would be very greatly
surprised. There have been so <i>many</i> strange things
happening lately!</p>
<p>Caesar had come over from Charles Street to help Mr.
Willoughby move his things. There was very little to move, for
the furniture had gone over to Charles Street in the morning, the
bed, the armchair, the pictures, the christening mug, the
miniature of his mother, the Jacobean dagger, the ancient Toby
jug and the rest. He himself in his bowler hat and overcoat stood
in the empty shabby room and bade it a sentimental farewell. He
was exceedingly happy; he could not yet believe his good fortune,
but at the same time he could not but realize all the years that
he had spent here, the thoughts, hopes, dreams. Yes, that
<i>was</i> sentimental, for the truth was that he had been
exceedingly unhappy here and gone almost crazy with loneliness,
insufficient food, and terror.</p>
<p>He was already great friends with Caesar. It was wonderful
that someone should treat him with politeness again just as in
the old days.</p>
<p>'I think we've got everything now, sir,' said Caesar, looking
like a bright, intelligent child masquerading as a mature
man.</p>
<p>'Yes, I think we really have. Dear me! Do you think I ought to
say good-bye to anybody?'</p>
<p>'I shouldn't trouble, sir, if I were you. Mrs. Delaney is
expecting you to take tea with her, I think, sir.'</p>
<p>'Oh, is she indeed? Very charming of her. Well, that settles
it, doesn't it? We'll be moving, shall we?'</p>
<p>What he was really frightened of was a last meeting with
Brocket. He had paid him his rent--all relationship between them
was over--but he couldn't believe, even now, that the shadow of
that grey-fleshed, corpulent body was to hang over his waking and
sleeping moments never again! However, he was to see Brocket once
more and in dramatic circumstances. He had walked with Caesar as
far as the middle of Market Street when he saw him--and Caesar
saw him too!</p>
<p>Brocket was there and standing in front of a girl, pushing his
face into hers, preventing her passing.</p>
<p>Caesar said: 'Excuse me, sir, will you?' and a moment later
had caught Brocket by the arm, crying, 'Leave her alone, you
dirty bully!'</p>
<p>At that shrill cry all the Market seemed to stir into action,
windows opened, people turned and gazed, shop-doors filled,
voices were raised. For Brocket had struck out at Caesar, and
Caesar had struck out at Brocket.</p>
<p>The girl cried, 'Don't, don't, Caesar! He'll kill you!' a
woman ran into a doorway and screamed, 'Mrs. Rudge! Mrs. Rudge!
They're murdering your son,' and Caesar and Brocket were
instantly an indistinguishable confusion.</p>
<p>It was not a very handsome fight. Caesar was a diminutive
beside his enemy, but he had been a boxer in his time. The
trouble was that he found himself involved so desperately in the
stuffings and swellings and soft places of Brocket's
ill-conditioned body that he could never get himself clear to
strike an honourable blow. Brocket, who was altogether out of
condition, believed in nothing so tame as fair play. He kicked,
he bit, he tore at Caesar's collar, coat, hair, or anything else
in his way, and did achieve one big scratch with his dirty
finger-nails all down Caesar's left cheek. That was, however, his
solitary success.</p>
<p>After losing his breath in Brocket's beastly belly and
wriggling within his indecent bear-like hug, Caesar succeeded in
ducking his head, breaking away, and, in one instant of glorious
freedom and vision, managed to deliver so successful a blow on
Brocket's nose that that undoubted villain of Claude's and
Caesar's story fell backwards, flung his arms in the air,
shrieked aloud and lay, a writhing monstrosity, on the Market
Street pavement.</p>
<p>By this time the whole of the Market was calling aloud,
singing, shouting and, on the part of a number of small boys,
skipping and dancing. It was a glorious end to the year. There
should have been a policeman, but there wasn't one, and for a
brief ecstatic moment, in the lights and the mist and the flowers
and leather and fish and newspapers and antiques and cuts off the
joint and rooms for single gentlemen, the Market knew once again,
as it had known often enough in its historic past, what it was to
assert its common spirit and sense of fun and general
light-heartedness.</p>
<p>The moment was quickly ended. Caesar straightened himself. He
was breathing hard, his cheek was bleeding, his collar was torn,
his trousers covered with mud. He showed nevertheless a fine and
simple dignity.</p>
<p>'That'll teach him a lesson he won't soon forget.'</p>
<p>He attended then to his mother, who now that the fight was
over was remembering that she had once been lodge-keeper at
Wintersmoon and was at present surrounded by a crowd of common
vulgar populace. And there, the origin of all the trouble, was
that horrid nasty girl.</p>
<p>'Now, Mother,' said Caesar, 'you go along home. I'll be
visiting you later. And this,' he had his hand on the girl's arm,
'is Miss Margaret Dundee, to whom I am engaged and hope shortly
to marry. Now let's have no more words.'</p>
<p>This he said in front of the assembled Market.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rudge gave him one look, then, recognizing for the first
time since she bore him that he was her master, without a word
went meekly to her home.</p>
<p>'Now, sir,' said Caesar, 'I'm ready if you please. And you
won't mind, I hope, sir, if Miss Dundee, my fiancée, comes as far
as Charles Street in our company.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was half an hour to midnight. They had turned off the
wireless because of the noise that it was making. They would turn
it on again just before Big Ben struck.</p>
<p>Very little was said. It was clear enough that everyone was
happy. Fred Delaney looked at the three old people and was glad
that he was their host--Millie Pake, Claude Willoughby, old
Ragadoon. They sat near to one another, all very straight-backed,
for they were of the generation that had been taught to sit up
straight even though you were tumbriling guillotine-wards. The
happiest of the three, perhaps, was Claude Willoughby. He sat
there, a glass of something in his hand, staring in front of him,
not speaking, unable to believe his luck. When, that afternoon, a
tattered and torn Caesar had led him into the house, and dear,
kind Mrs. Delaney had taken him up to his flat, he had with
trembling lips said: 'Thank you! Oh, thank you very much!' and,
after that, had lost all power of speech for the rest of the
year. The good things are quite as true as the bad things, and
this was one of the good things. His bed, his table, his chair
were there. His Things had been laid out on the table for him to
arrange. The Jacobean dagger glittered at him, the Toby jug
grinned, his christening mug, always protective, was greatly
relieved to see him again. But when he saw the fresh
cream-coloured walls, and on the walls some of the pictures from
the great collection of Lord Ragadoon--in the bedroom drawings--a
Turner, a Cotman, a Caracci, an Ostade--and in the sitting-room
an oil sketch of an old man drinking by Frans Hals, a still life
by Manet of some roses in a silver dish, a small oil by
Constable, and the lovely head of a lovely lady by Alfred
Stevens--when he saw these things and understood that he was
appointed as guardian of them--then he sat down and his thin
chest heaved and his hands rose and fell again, and he knew the
happiest moment of all his life.</p>
<p>He understood, too, that Lord Ragadoon, weary of his many
years' 'piggery,' had brought servants to Charles Street with
him, and that one of these (an elderly kind-faced woman whose
name was Mrs. Mumble) would look after his wants, that the only
expenses he would have would be to pay for his food, that he had
his own bathroom and need dread no longer any Major Pierson.
Then, for the first time for many, many years, his heart changed
from its odd, leaping, frightened beat to a steady, normal,
friendly monotony.</p>
<p>So now he sat in the Delaney drawing-room waiting for the New
Year.</p>
<p>Millie Pake was placidly looking into the fire and thinking of
the past. She was very happy, of course, to be back in the old
room, and Helen seemed to be there with her. It was true that the
Bloomsbury room had been horrid, but she was worried a little
about all the other old gentlewomen who hadn't encountered her
good-fortune, who were still wondering where the next meal would
come from, who were still eking out a miserable scuttle of slack
shrivelled coal, and, worst of all, had no one, at this end of
another dreary year, to give them a thought or care whether they
were alive or no. 'I shall speak to Meg about them,' she thought.
'She's sure to have an idea.' She was thinking also of her Aunt
Sybella, who had lost all her hair in a fire and been racked with
pain and had yet never lost her cheerfulness. 'I'm afraid I lost
mine once or twice. There's no doubt I might have behaved
better.'</p>
<p>She was pleased that Lord Ragadoon trusted her to look after
his pictures, but in her heart she would have preferred to have a
few of her own--a nice water-colour or two and some
photographs.</p>
<p>Of what old Ragadoon was thinking--he was quite smart
to-night, his beard combed, wearing a black velvet jacket and
silver buckles on his old-fashioned evening shoes--no one ever
knew. He appeared, however, to be in excellent spirits.</p>
<p>Bullock and Lizzie were sitting together on the sofa, and
<i>their</i> happy moment seemed to be extending itself
indefinitely.</p>
<p>Kitty was sitting in a chair near the fire. Whether she were
happy or not she did not know. Happiness did not seem exactly the
point with her. Perhaps it would never be. Rather her spirit was
charged with the sense of expectation. The Braque picture,
Zanti's shop, her friendship with dear Sarah Grafton, the
adventure with the Foster family, these things had, all of them
together, opened a door for her, promising her a life not of
happiness but of active developing experience. Foster Senior had
been right (how could she ever have thought of him as Mr.
Turveydrop?) when he had said that life was rough and brutal and
meant to be, and that from it you extracted if you were truly
alive great moments of experience, and that, feeding on these,
you must grow. Painful, cruel moments fed your growth perhaps
more truly than happy ones. He was right, too, when he said that
she knew nothing as yet about men and women. To-morrow, with the
New Year, she would begin to learn. Her capacity for love--her
greatest gift although she did not know it--spread over all her
friends--poor Alton, Sarah Grafton, Foster whom she would like to
see again but would never, Robert Beaminster who would, she
hoped, soon marry someone very nice indeed--and then about
everyone in this room and especially her own beloved family--her
father, her mother, Bullock. She shaded her eyes with her hand
from the firelight. . . . Whom else would the New Year bring? All
her real experience had yet to begin.</p>
<p>Fred Delaney noticed that Meg was not there. He went quietly
into the bedroom and found her brushing her hair.</p>
<p>'I want to be tidy for the New Year,' she said.</p>
<p>'It's ten minutes to.'</p>
<p>She leaned back against the chair and looked up at him. He
came over to her and kissed her.</p>
<p>'You know,' she said, 'we've never discussed it. Not a word.
That day, I mean, when we didn't go away.'</p>
<p>He grinned. 'There wasn't anything to say. We both made fools
of ourselves.'</p>
<p>'I just didn't. I don't know what happened to you. I don't
want to know.' She took a look at the glass. 'There! I'm as right
as I shall ever be. I only want to say this, Fred. You need never
worry about me again. <i>That</i> will never--'</p>
<p>'Here,' he said, interrupting, 'I don't want any discussion.
Haven't we always agreed that we trusted one another?'</p>
<p>'Perhaps we trusted one another too much. What we agreed to
really was a kind of act of collusion--and now that seems to me
somehow horrible.</p>
<p>'I don't really know what possessed me. The funny thing was
that I saw him so little--Graham Pender, I mean--and almost
always with his wife. It was the sight of my long-lost youth
recovered so unexpectedly that led me on, I think. Affection for
him--and then something wild in me. It will always be there--but
it won't go <i>that</i> way again.'</p>
<p>'All right, old girl,' Fred said.</p>
<p>'And I'll tell you why. Not religion and not morality. They've
got a lot to say, but oddly enough they were neither of them as
important as something else. Am I being very solemn, Fred
darling?'</p>
<p>'You are rather.'</p>
<p>'For once I want to be. It was our relationship that would
have suffered. If I'd gone with Graham for that week-end our
relationship--yours and mine--would never have been the same
again. You mayn't believe that, but it's true. We've always
believed in giving one another absolute liberty, haven't we?'</p>
<p>'We have and do.'</p>
<p>'I see now that we ought to have fixed our eyes on something
else. Through years and years, trouble and fun and anxiety and
relief--through a million little things--we've built up a
wonderful relationship--a sort we can neither of us ever have
again with any human being. And all the time something in life
tries to pull it down, to destroy it. It's attacked ceaselessly.
Every action of ours damages or improves it. It's the same, I
think, with every friendship, passion, marriage, parents and
children. And so, when it's the best thing you have, the grandest
and greatest, what an idiot you are if you do anything, say
anything, think anything that doesn't strengthen it.' She
stopped.</p>
<p>He was greatly moved and amused too. He put his arms on her
shoulders.</p>
<p>'And I, Meg--what about <i>my</i> damaging it?'</p>
<p>'That's for <i>you</i> to decide,' she said.</p>
<p>They stayed in a close embrace.</p>
<p>'Come,' he said. 'It's three minutes.'</p>
<p>As she turned back to her dressing-table again for a moment he
said:</p>
<p>'Is it right for us to be so happy?'</p>
<p>'I think so--as long as we are not fools nor too selfish.'</p>
<p>'This crazy world--'</p>
<p>'We're part of it.' She went toward the door, turned for a
moment. 'Not now, not in our lifetime, Fred, dear, will the last
word be said. Men are not mad for ever. It's a long, long story.'
She sighed, looked towards him with an absolute devotion.
'Meanwhile let's love one another--and not be more afraid than we
can help.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stood there for a moment after she had gone. The house was
secure, for a while at least. It had been a dangerous year, but
at the end of it they were all together.</p>
<p>He saw his beloved town, danger, destruction hanging over it,
but it seemed to him indestructible. He remembered his
conversation with Patrick a year ago. Aye Bourne and the stream
running through Marylebone across Oxford Street and May Fair . .
. the meadowlands of May Fair, the milkmaids' song where the Ritz
is. Old Q with his muff, Robert Baker the tailor. . . . And now
it was on tiptoe to welcome the New Year, the dance bands
playing, the lights shining, the wind blowing through the Park
trees, the barges lying dark on the river, the men and women
kneeling in the churches, so many stairs and rooms and roofs and
chimneys--the spirit indestructible, the soul eternal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He went into the other room. The wireless had been turned on
again. The three old people were sitting straight in their
chairs, Lizzie and Bullock hand in hand, Meg and Kitty standing
side by side.</p>
<p>Big Ben began to strike.</p>
<p>'Come on,' he cried. 'Join hands. For Auld Lang Syne.'</p>
<p> </p>
