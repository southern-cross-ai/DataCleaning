<h2><a name="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>No life of the first circumnavigator of Australia has hitherto
appeared in English. Nothing has been accessible to the English
reader but an abstract of one voyage and a few lines in biographical
dictionaries. This is scarcely surprising, when we consider how
careless Tasman's own countrymen have been of his fame. Fifty years
ago all that had been printed in his own country consisted of short
abstracts of a few voyages, and these were hidden away in bulky
collections. Even the date and place of his birth were matter for
conjecture .and dispute. Things are somewhat better now. Thirty-five
years ago the complete journal of his famous voyage of 1642 was
published in Holland, and we are now promised a sumptuous <i>fac
simile</i> edition of the original manuscript, with notes by two
eminent scholars, and with an English translation.</p>

<p>Moreover, patient searchers in the Dutch Colonial Archives have
for years past been laboriously gleaning scattered particulars
respecting him, and the results of their investigations have been
printed from time to time in the transactions of Dutch learned
societies, and in other places. It has thus become possible to piece
together a fairly connected account of the great navigator's
life.</p>

<p>But after all available information has been made use of, the
result is disappointing. The man himself remains for the most part an
indistinct figure. Personal details are few. The facts are mostly dry
and meagre, gathered from formal official despatches and dusty
registers. The material is wanting for a biography which would give a
clear and sharply defined picture of the man as he lived.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to attain what is of even more interest.
We can arrive at a just estimate of his work as a discoverer, and of
his place among the great navigators of the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: iv}</u></p>

<p>world. The discovery of Tasmania and New Zealand was no chance
adventure. It was the result of a steady policy. It was the outcome
of the adventurous energy which in the 16th and 17th centuries
created the Dutch Republic; gave to Holland her Colonial Empire;
and--not content with her possession of the Eastern Archipelago--sent
out her sailors to search for a New world in the unknown regions of
the mysterious South. Tasman and Visscher are but types of the men
who won for their country her once proud position of mistress of the
seas.</p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt has been made not merely to give
all that is known of Tasman's life and work, but to present that work
in proper historical perspective.</p>

<p>I desire to acknowledge generally my obligation to the authors
whose names appear in the list appended to this paper, particularly
to Messrs. Dozy, Heeres, Van Boekeren, and Leupe. Also to Sir Edward
Braddon for his courtesy in having, when Agent-General for Tasmania,
obtained for me valuable information from Holland. Especially to Mr.
J. E. Heeres, of the Dutch State Archives at The Hague, for his
generous kindness in placing at my disposal manuscript notes of his
researches in the old Colonial Records--notes containing interesting
details which have never before appeared in print. And, lastly, to
the Treasurer, Sir Philip Fysh, for authorising the printing of this
paper at the Government Press of the Colony. It is fitting that the
first English biography of Tasman should be offered to Australian
readers by the country which he discovered and which bears his
name.</p>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The modern era of maritime discovery may be said to begin with the
work of Prince Henry of Portugal, surnamed "The Navigator"
(1394-1460). Prince Henry devoted his life to the furtherance of
geographical discovery. He was inspired by the hope of finding the
sea-route to the East, and winning for his country the rich trade of
India and Cathay. During forty years he sent out from Lagos fleet
after fleet bound for the exploration of the coasts of Africa.
Further and further south into the unknown and dreaded Atlantic his
caravels pushed their way, until at his death, in 1460, his captains
had reached the mouth of the Gambia beyond Cape Verde, and had
colonised the Azores. The discoveries made under this Prince's
inspiring influence were the stepping-stone to the great voyages
which marked the close of the century. Following the initiative of
Henry, the bold genius of Columbus conceived the splendid idea of
finding the East by sailing west; and, in 1492, when he fell upon
America, he believed that he had reached the further shores of India.
Five years later Henry's countryman, Vasco da Gama, in a voyage
almost as important as that of Columbus, doubled the Cape of Good
Hope, and opened the gates of the sea-way to Calicut and the East.
Pope Alexander the Sixth by his famous Bull apportioned the world
between the discoverers--allotting the western half to Spain, and the
eastern to Portugal. From that time the gold and silver of the West
were poured into the lap of Spain while Portugal gathered in as her
sole property the rich profits of the coveted trade of the East. For
well nigh a century the two nations enjoyed a practical monopoly of
the regions which the daring of their sailors had won. Spain, in
particular, through the wealth she acquired from her American
possessions, became the dominant power in the world, and the mistress
of the sea. Her fall from that high eminence was due to her arrogant
greed for universal dominion, and her attempt to crush a free nation
of traders.</p>

<p>In the 15th and 16th centuries the Netherlands--the Low Countries
of common English parlance--were the most prosperous nation in
Europe. While other nations exhausted themselves in war, they devoted
themselves to the arts of peace. In agriculture they were far in
advance of all other countries of the time, The Flemish weavers were
the first in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 2}</u></p>

<p>the world, and their looms supplied England and all Europe with
the best linen and woollen fabrics. In an age when salted provisions
were almost the sole winter diet of all classes, the fisheries of the
North Sea were nearly as important as the manufactures of Flanders.
These fisheries were well nigh monopolised by the Hollanders, and
were a rich mine of wealth to the northern towns, while they trained
a hardy and daring race of sailors. In addition to their manufactures
and their fisheries, the Dutch had become the traders and carriers of
the European world. It was Dutch ships and Dutch sailors that
distributed throughout Europe the treasures brought by Spanish and
Portuguese fleets from the East and West Indies.</p>

<p>The Netherlands were an appanage of the Spanish crown. But, the
rich manufacturing and trading cities of Flanders and Holland enjoyed
considerable liberties and powers of local self-government, granted
to them from time to time by their over-lords in exchange for heavy
annual payments. It was the attempt of the Spanish king Philip the
Second to abolish the charters of their towns, to stamp out their
liberties, and to suppress the Reformed Religion by means of the
Inquisition, that led to the rise of the Dutch Republic, and the long
and cruel war with the revolted Provinces, which lasted eighty years
(1566-1648), and finally resulted in the humiliation of Spain.</p>

<p>The Dutch revolt forms one of the most striking epochs in history.
It was the first blow struck in modern times for human freedom and
liberty of conscience against the despotism of kings and the
intolerance of priests. The power of the strongest empire in the
world was put forth to crush the revolted citizens. Treachery,
torture, and massacre were freely and ruthlessly employed. The
butcheries of the Duke of Alva still stand out pre-eminent in the
bloody annals of tyranny and persecution. The story, as we read it in
the graphic pages of Motley, bristles with deeds of ferocious cruelty
and blood.</p>

<p>The struggle would have been hopeless, but that their extremity
taught the Dutch to find their strength upon the sea. Powerless
before their enemies on land, the patriots took to the ocean. In
small vessels their hardy sailors cut off the Spanish supplies, made
daring descents on sea-coast towns; and in process of time set
themselves to work to strike Spain in her most vulnerable part, her
commerce with the New World, from which she drew her wealth. The
Beggars of the Sea, as the Dutch rovers styled themselves, became the
terror of the richly laden galleons and haughty fleets of Spain. Not
only did they cut off the supplies of gold and silver from the New
World on which the Spanish King depended,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 3}</u></p>

<p>but in the spoils which they wrested from the enemy and in the
trade which they were continually extending they found the means for
their country to carry on the conflict. England, almost equally in
danger from Spanish designs, made common cause against the enemy.
Even when the countries were not at open war, Drake and the English
seamen acknowledged no peace with Spain beyond the Line, but captured
her ships `and sacked her settlements on the Spanish Main, returning
home laden with treasure. Foiled in his disastrous attempt to conquer
England with his Great Armada, Philip was equally unsuccessful in his
efforts to destroy the Dutch commerce. In vain did he prohibit the
Hollanders from trading with his dominions. In vain did he from time
to time lay embargoes on their ships, and send thousands of their
sailors to languish in the dungeons of the Inquisition. The bold
Hollanders only replied by vigorous reprisals. They mocked at his
prohibitions, and continued to carry on an ever increasing and
enormously profitable illicit trade. Dutch and English privateers
triumphantly swept the seas and harried the Spaniards at their
pleasure. Subjugated Flanders had become an obedient Spanish
province; her rich merchants had fled, and her people were starving
in a desolated country. But the unconquered United Provinces of the
north were actually profiting by the war, and every day growing
richer and more powerful.</p>

<p>The long struggle on the seas, and its successful issue, roused
both in England and Holland an insatiable spirit of adventure. In
England this spirit found its outlet in privateering or piratical
exploits, such as those of Hawkins and Drake; or in romantic
expeditions, such as that of Raleigh to Guiana; and led, in its
ultimate development, to the establishment of our Colonial and Indian
Empire.</p>

<p>In Holland the adventurous spirit received a strong stimulus from
the blind and stupid policy of the Spanish king. For a hundred
years--ever since the discovery of the Cape route to the East
Indies--Lisbon had been the great centre of the eastern trade. It was
thither the Dutch traders came to bring wheat, fish, and other
products of Northern Europe, and to carry away in return and
distribute the spices and merchandise of the East. In 1594
Philip--who had some time before acquired the crown of
Portugal--closed the port of Lisbon, and prohibited Dutch and English
ships, even under a neutral flag, from trading with any part of his
empire. The blow not only failed of its effect, but recoiled on the
striker. It ruined Lisbon; crippled Spain; and made the Dutch East
Indian Empire. With a sagacious daring the Hollanders immediately
formed the steady resolve to find these eastern</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 4}</u></p>

<p>treasures for themselves, and wrest the trade from their
enemies.</p>

<p>Their first attempt to reach the Indies was discouraging. It was a
favourite idea in those days that a short and practicable route to
China and India could be found by the north-east passage round the
north of Europe. To find this passage and take the Portuguese in the
rear was the object of the first Dutch enterprise. The expedition
proved disastrous getting no further than Nova Zembla. Two subsequent
expeditions in the same direction met with no better fate.</p>

<p>Baffled in their efforts to find a passage through the frozen seas
of the North, the Dutch turned their attention to the old route round
the Cape. The merchants of Amsterdam formed a company, under the
quaint name of "The Company of Far Lands," and fitted out four
vessels, the largest 400 tons, and the smallest only 30 tons burden.
The little fleet-sailed from the Texel 2nd April, 1595. After a
fifteen months' voyage it reached Java, and laid the foundation of
the Dutch eastern trade. From this time numerous new companies were
formed in Holland: every year fresh fleets left for the east, many of
them returning with rich cargoes, and making enormous profits. In
spite of the violent attacks of the Spaniards and Portuguese, the
Dutch steadily pushed their way in the Eastern Archipelago, and made
reprisals on their enemies with telling effect. Their humane and
prudent conduct contributed greatly to their success in establishing
trade relations with the native princes, by whom the Portuguese were
detested for their cruelty, arrogance, and overbearing behaviour.</p>

<p>The English had now entered into competition with the Dutch in the
India trade, and in 1600 the first English East India Company was
founded. But the English company found their rivals too powerful. In
1602 the various companies in Holland agreed to cease their mutual
competition and unite. This was the beginning of the famous Dutch
East India Company, which, on 20th March, 1602, received from the
States-General a charter for twenty-one years, giving it an exclusive
monopoly of the trade with the East. The company had a capital of six
and a half millions of florins or &pound;550,000, more than eight
times that of its English rival. It was managed by a body of
seventeen directors, known as the Council of Seventeen.</p>

<p>The Dutch had already (1602) established themselves permanently in
Java. Here they founded the city of Batavia, which became the centre
of their trade and the residence of the Governor-General of their
Eastern possessions. They established factories in Malabar, drove the
Spaniards from Amboyna</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 5}</u></p>

<p>and took possession of the island, wrested Malacca from the
Portuguese, and expelled the same nation froth the Moluccas or Spice
Islands. In 1621, less than twenty years after its foundation, the
Company had a practical monopoly of the trade in cloves, nutmegs,
cinnamon, and other products of the Archipelago. The Portuguese had
been driven out, and, England only waged an obstinate but
unsuccessful rivalry. In 1638 the Dutch supplanted the Portuguese in
Japan, and in 1656 got possession of the island of Ceylon.</p>

<p>In a work by Sir Walter Raleigh, entitled "Observations touching
Trade and Commerce with the Hollanders and other Nations," presented
to King James in the year 1603, we find a striking picture of the
commerce of the Netherlands as compared with that of England.</p>

<p>Raleigh attributes the sudden and astonishing rise of the
Netherlanders, among other causes, to the "embargoing and
confiscating of their ships in Spain, which constrained them, and
gave them courage to trade by force into the East and West Indies,
and in Africa, where they employ 180 ships and 8700 mariners." (This,
it should be noted, was only seven years after the first Dutch vessel
had reached Java.) Sir Walter gives a number of interesting
particulars respecting the extent of Dutch trade. He says, "We send
into the Eastern kingdoms [of Europe] yearly but 100 ships; the Low
Countries 3000. They send into France, Portugal, and Italy from the
Eastern kingdoms through the Sound and our narrow seas 2000 ships;
we, none. They trade with 500 or 600 ships into our country; we, with
40 ships to three of their towns. They have as many ships as eleven
kingdoms of Christendom, let England be one. They build yearly 1000
ships, having not one timber tree growing in their own country, nor
home-bred commodities to lade 100 ships, yet they have 20,000 ships
and vessels, and all employed." In shipbuilding and seamanship also
the Dutch sailors in those days were the superiors of the English,
for Sir Walter says that while an English ship of a hundred tons
required a crew of thirty men, the Hollanders would sail a ship of
the same size with ten men.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to dwell on the naval exploits of Drake,
Hawkins, and Frobisher, on the enterprise of the Elizabethan sailors
and merchant-adventurers, and on the marvellous success of-our own
great East India Company. We have good reason to feel pride in the
deeds of the gallant English seamen of those days, and in the trade
which in later times has carried the English flag into every sea. But
we are apt to forget how comparatively recent is the predominant
position of England in commerce and in naval power. In the 17th</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 6}</u></p>

<p>century it was the Dutch who were the sailors and the merchants of
the world and the masters of the sea. Not London, but Amsterdam, was
the great emporium for the products of East and West, the centre of
the world's trade, and the richest city on the globe. The commerce of
Europe and of the world was in the hands of the merchants of the Low
Countries, who had a hundred ships afloat for every one owned by
Englishmen.</p>

<h1>TASMAN'S LIFE AND VOYAGES.</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<h2><a name="ch-01"></a>I.--YOUTH AND EARLY VOYAGES, 1603-1638.</h2>

<p>It was in the midst of the Eighty Years. War, in the year after
the foundation of the Company in whose service he was to win his
fame, and in the same year that Sir Walter Raleigh presented to King
James his memorial on the trade of the Hollanders, that Abel Janszoon
Tasman stepped onto this world's stage. He was born in the little
inland village of Luytjegast, in the province of Groningen, in the
year 1603. Groningen is the most north-easterly province of Holland,
and formed part of the ancient Friesland. It is flat, even for
proverbially flat Holland. The highest hill, the Doeseberg, rises to
a height of only 35 feet above the level of the ocean, and some of
the country lies even below the sea level. It is protected from the
furious inroads of the North Sea by magnificent dykes of timber and
stone. Behind these massive ramparts stretch wide and fertile fields
and meadows, rich in agricultural and dairy produce. The cultivators,
who hold their lands under a species of tenant right, are at present
the richest and most prosperous peasant farmers in the whole of
Europe. In Roman times the Frisians occupied the country from the
Elbe to the Rhine, including the extensive tract now covered by the
Zuyder Zee, over which the sea burst so late as the thirteenth
century. They were sea rovers as well as cattle herdsmen, and were
distinguished for their fierce independence and indomitable love of
liberty. They were one of the tribes that took part in the conquest
of Britain. At this day the Frisian language, spoken by a handful of
people is the most nearly related of all Low German dialects to the
English, and the men are nearest to the English in blood. The
Frieslanders are of a different race from the inhabitants of Holland
proper. The typical Dutchman is squat and short-legged; the
Frieslander, tall, yellow-haired, blue-eyed, and of powerful build.
We may fairly believe that Tasman belonged to this tall, bold, and
impetuous race, who supplied no small proportion of the hardy
fishermen and sailors whose daring made Holland a great sea
power.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 7}</u></p>

<p>We have no information as to the Tasman family, but it is to be
presumed that its social status was a humble one. How Abel came by
the surname which is now world-renowned is a matter of dispute. In
the Luytjegast district family names were unknown until the beginning
of this century. The son added to his own christian name the
christian name of his father; thus, Abel, the son of John, became
Abel Janszoon, and by this name simply Tasman is often designated in
the old records. A nickname was often acquired, derived from some
personal peculiarity, from a trade, a sign, or a ship. It has been
conjectured that either Abel Jansz or his father took the name Tasman
or Taschman from a boat or vessel named the <i>Tasch</i> (bag or
net), belonging to the family.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>Of young Abel's early life in the flat polders or meadows of
Luytjegast there is no record. The boy would see little or nothing of
the horrors of the war which for forty years had been desolating a
great part of the Low Countries. The most desperate part of the
struggle was over with the death of Alexander of Parma. The gloomy
bigot and tyrant, Philip the Second, was dead. Flanders had fallen,
and had become an obedient and desolate Spanish province, under the
rule of the Archduke Albert and his wife Isabella of Spain; but the
United Provinces, under Prince Maurice of Nassau, son of William the
Silent, were not only holding their own against the Spaniards, but
were daily growing in prosperity and power. When young Abel was six
years old they had succeeded in wringing from their exhausted enemy a
twelve years' truce, with the acknowledgment of the Republic, and of
its right to carry on the India trade. The boy's imagination must
have been often stirred by tales of the daring deeds of the Beggars
of the Sea, and the heroic resistance of Hollanders and Zeelanders to
the mighty power of Spain. Not less must his spirit of adventure have
been stimulated by the stories that drifted to his quiet village
telling of the riches of India, of the Spice Islands, and of far
Cathay. Small wonder that the old sea-roving Frisian blood asserted
itself, and that Abel Jansz; like the majority of Hollanders in that
age, found his vocation as a sailor. That he had managed to acquire
some education is evident from the fact that he had at least leaned
to write, a somewhat rare accomplishment in those days fore persons
in his humble station.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that in the fisheries of the North Sea, that
nursery of daring sailors, he served his first apprenticeship to the
ocean. But the adventurous spirit was strong within him, and it was
natural that he should soon find his way to</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 8}</u></p>

<p>Amsterdam, the centre of the commerce of the world, eager to seek
his fortune in the rich eastern lands which his countrymen had won.
He had married young--either in his native province or in
Amsterdam--and his wife, Claesjie Heyndricks, had died, leaving him
an only daughter. When we get the first definite information
respecting him he was a widower, living in the Terketelsteeg
(Tarkettle Lane), one of the poorest quarters of Amsterdam. Here, on
the 27th December, 1631, he married his second wife, Jannetjie
Tjaers.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> He was not encumbered with
property,--at least his name does not appear in the contemporary
register of assessment for the half per cent. tax. His wife was not
greatly his superior in social position, and could not sign the
marriage register. She belonged to a working-class family,--her
father being a powder-maker, and her brother a sailor, like her
husband. The family were not, however, altogether without means. They
were owners of one, if not two, small houses in Amsterdam. The young
couple began life in a more respectable locality than Tarkettle Lane,
setting up house in the Palm-street. It cannot have been long after
his marriage that Abel Jansz, then 28 or 29 years old, made what was
probably his first voyage to the East Indies, in the service of the
Dutch East India Company. That shortly after this time he was in the
service of the Company in the Eastern Seas we know from independent
evidence. Mr. Heeres has found in the old Colonial archives two
declarations signed by Tasman in 1634, which inform us of his rapid
rise, during the space of two years at most, from the position of a
simple sailor to that of master of a ship. In May he was mate of the
ship <i>Weesp</i> (<i>Wasp</i>), trading from Batavia in Java, to
Amboyna in the Moluccas. In July the Governor of Amboyna appointed
him master--" skipper" was the term in those days--of the jachtt<b
style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b><i>Mocha.</i></p>

<p>Tasman was therefore employed in the spice trade, the chief centre
of which was the Moluccas or Spice Islands, and especially Amboyna
and the Banda Isles, the native home of the nutmeg and the clove. In
these days it is difficult for us to understand the value which our
forefathers, even down to the end of the 17th century, set upon
eastern apices--pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and especially</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 9}</u></p>

<p>cloves. It has been remarked that at banquets in England in the
Middle Ages a place next to the spice-box was more coveted than the
proverbial place above the salt. This may probably be explained by
the fact of the little variety of food possible during the Middle
Ages, when (in the winter especially) all classes had to live mostly
on salt provisions--especially salt fish--and had hardly any fresh
vegetables, until the Dutch taught Europe how to grow them. Before
the discovery of the route round the Cape, a pound of spice was often
worth as much as a. quarter of wheat. After Da Gama's voyage the
trade remained for a century in the hands of the Portuguese, and the
monopoly yielded them enormous profit, sometimes as much as
fifty-fold. The hope of getting possession of this coveted trade was
the chief incentive to Dutch efforts to reach the Indiea. Pepper,
ginger, and cinnamon were too widely grown to enable them to command
a monopoly, and in these articles the English East India Company was
able with more or less success to divide the trade with the Dutch. It
was otherwise with the more valued spices, such as nutmeg and cloves.
These were limited to a few of the East India Islands. Cloves in
particular grew nowhere but on two or three islands of the Moluccas.
To secure the monopoly of these the Dutch accordingly bent all their
energies. In 1605 they succeeded in driving the Portuguese out of
Amboyna, and obtaining the mastery of the whole of the Moluccas. The
English East India Company kept up an obstinate rivalry, but the
Dutch met them with determined hostility. They attacked the English
factories on small pretext, captured their vessels, and, after the
massacre of a number of English traders at Amboyna, in 1623, finally
excluded their rivals from all share in the trade. This contest for
the spice trade was the origin and chief cause of the long and bitter
enmity between the two nations. To such lengths did the Dutch go that
some years later they ruthlessly rooted up the clove plantations on
all the islands of the Moluccas except Amboyna and Banda. Here alone
did they allow the clove to be produced, in order that they might
enhance the price and make certain of preserving their monopoly.</p>

<p>But to return to Tasman. It is evident that his singular capacity
had soon made itself evident to the colonial authorities, for in
August, 1635, we find the simple sailor of three years before, now as
"Commandeur Abel," cruising at the head of a fleet of small vessels
(<i>kiels</i>) to protect the jealously guarded monopoly from foreign
intrusion, and generally to harass the ships of hostile European
rivals in the waters of Amboyna arid the Banda Sea. In September,
1636, he was on his way back to Batavia, the centre of Dutch rule and
the residence</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 10}</u></p>

<p>of the Governor-General of the Indies. On his arrival, he found
himself involved in difficulties with his crew. They cited him before
the Chief Magistrate's Court complaining that while cruising in the
Banda Sea he had, presumably in the interests of his own pocket,
stinted them of their necessary allowance of rations. As he was
acquitted by the Court, which was sufficiently experienced in such
matters, we may conclude that he was unjustly accused: at least we
may give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>He was now bent on revisiting the home country, and to accomplish
this he was ready to accept for the time a subordinate post, and
accordingly shipped as mate on board the <i>Banda</i>. The
<i>Banda</i> was the flagship of a homeward-bound fleet (<i>retour
vloot</i>) of several sail. Her skipper was Matthys Quast, a bold and
capable sailor, of whom we shall hear more presently. When on the
point of sailing, on 30th December, 1636, the officers and crew, 111
in number, were required to make a declaration, which is interesting
as illustrative of the troubled state of the times, of the dangers of
war, and the prevalence of privateering. It also shows the survival
of the ancient usage--a part of the old maritime law of the 13th
century, the Roles d'Oleron--which gave to the ship's Council, and
even to the common sailors, a voice in the control of the voyage. By
this declaration--to which the whole 111 set their signatures or
marks--the Governor, skipper, merchant, mates, officers, soldiers,
and seamen, presently appointed and sailing on the ship <i>Banda</i>,
solemnly promised that, in view of the Spanish men-of-war and the
privateers of Dunkirk, they would in no wise pass through the English
Channel, but would hold their course round England, Ireland, and
Scotland, so that they might in safety make the harbours of the
Fatherland.</p>

<p>The <i>Banda</i> arrived at the Texel on 1st August, 1637, after a
seven months' voyage. Tasman remained at Amsterdam for some months
with his wife Jannetie, who had recovered from an illness so serious
that she had made her will. This will is still in existence. It was
drawn up on 18th December, 1636, by the Notary, Pieter Barcman. It
recites that the worthy Jannetje Tjercks, wife of Abel Jansz Tasman,
citizen, was then lying ill in bed, but was of good memory and
understanding. Her residence was at the corner of the Palm
cross-street on the Braeck. Should the testatrix die without issue,
then, after certain bequests to the poor, she constituted her sister,
Geertje Tjercks, her sole legatee. There is no mention of her husband
or of the little step-daughter, Claesjen. We need not therefore
assume that there had been any quarrel between the married pair. The
absence of Abel in the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 11}</u></p>

<p>Indies, from which return was so uncertain, may explain why the
wife should leave her property to relations on the spot.</p>

<p>Meantime Abel and his brothers-in-law appeared before the
Amsterdam magistrates with the object of selling the family house in
the Palm-street for 500 florins. For some reason the contract was
cancelled, and the family retained the house until 1650, when Powels
Barentsz, in his own name, and as attorney for his brother-in-law
Tasman, who was then in the Indies, conveyed the property to Andries
Barents.</p>

<p>After a stay of some nine months in Amsterdam, Abel Jansz once
more set his face eastwards. He entered into a new ten years'
engagement with the Company, and in consideration of this he was
allowed to take his wife with him--the Council of Seventeen having
just passed a new regulation whereby the chief officers were
permitted to take their wives to the East Indies, provided they were
lawfully wedded, were of good lives, and could show good credentials.
Tasman was put in command of the fly-ship<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> <i>Engel</i> (<i>Angel</i>), fitted out by
the Amsterdam Chamber. VThe <i>Engel</i> sailed from the Texel, 15th
April, 1638, and arrived at Batavia on 11th October following. The
skipper's pay was 60 guilders (&pound;5) per month. On arrival at
Batavia he was continued in his post for three years at an increased
pay of 80 guilders (&pound;6 13s. 4d.) per month.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02"></a>II.--VOYAGES IN JAPAN SEAS, &amp;c.,
1639-1642.</h2>

<p>It is in the year following his return to Batavia, some six years
after his first voyage thither, that we find Abel Jansz first chosen
to take a prominent part in a discovery expedition.</p>

<p>The enterprise of the early Dutch governors in their efforts to
open up new trade for their Company was ceaseless. Jan Pieterszoon
Coen, Governor-General between 1618 and 1629, was the most
illustrious, and the one who did most to consolidate the Dutch power.
He it was who built the fort at Batavia, and fixed the centre of
government there. He it was who in Java baffled the English, and
overmastered them in the Moluccas. During his rule Dutch ships first
made the coast of Australia. After Coen, the most famous governor--he
who showed the greatest energy in his persistent search for new lands
and new markets--was Antony van Diemen, the Governor-General who was
in power when Tasman returned to the Indies, and with whom his-fame
will be for ever associated.</p>

<p>Early in the career of the Dutch Company in the Eastern
Archipelago the Directors had east longing eyes towards the</p>

<p>powerful kingdom of the Great Khan--the Cathay whose wonders had
been first revealed to Europe by the traveller Marco Polo in the 13th
century. Not many years after Da Gama's discovery of the Cape route
(1516), the Portuguese had penetrated to Canton, and by the middle of
the 16th century (1542) had established relations with Japan, where,
for a time, they exerted a great influence, and carried on a
lucrative trade. When the Dutch reached the East they were not slow
to follow in the footsteps of their rivals. Seven years after the
foundation of the Company they sent ships to Japan, and continued to
trade there every year, in spite of the violent opposition of the
Portuguese. Finally they were allowed to set up a factory on Firando,
an island to the west of Kiusiu, and this soon became one of the most
profitable stations of the Company's trade.</p>

<p>In 1635 a certain William Verstegen, residing at Firando, sent a
letter to Batavia stating that the Japanese reported that many miles
to the eastward, in latitude 37&frac12;&ordm; North, there was "a
very great country or island, rich without measure in gold and
silver, and inhabited by civilised and friendly people." This was
just the sort of report to excite the imaginations of those early
traders, who were constantly tantalised by dreams of a new Mexico or
Peru to be discovered in the Pacific. It was known that in 1620 the
Spaniards had searched in vain for this golden island; but,
undeterred by the former failure, Governor-General Van Diemen and his
Council resolved to fit out an expedition to make the discovery. The
scheme, through various domestic troubles, lay in abeyance for some
years, but in 1639 two ships were fitted out for the adventure.
Tasman's ship, the <i>Engel</i>, was one of the vessels chosen. The
other was named the <i>Gracht</i> (<i>Canal</i>), and was under the
command of an experienced sailor and pilot, Matthys H endrikszoon
Quast, under whom Abel had sailed as mate in the <i>Banda</i> on the
homeward voyage three years before. Quast was chief, and Tasman
second in command. Tasman was now about 35 years old; he had been but
six years in the Company's service, and had not only risen from the
grade of a simple sailor to that of captain of a ship, but was now
entrusted with the second place in a difficult and important
enterprise. His rapid, promotion proves that Quast and the Colonial
authorities had recognised in him high qualities as a seaman and a
leader of men. The ships sailed from Batavia on 2nd June and made
their way round the north of the Philippine Islands, keeping a
northeasterly course until on 20th July they sighted some islands
belonging to a group now known as the Bonin Archipelago. Thence they
steered north-east, and then hack to the Japan coast searching for
the land of gold. From this point they</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 13}</u></p>

<p>pushed out again into the great ocean further than any one before
them, to a distance of some 2000 miles east from Japan. For two
months longer they cruised backwards and forwards in those far
northern seas, between 37&frac12;&ordm; and 46&deg; north latitude,
straining their eves in vain for some indication of the golden
island. They were in a wretched condition. Many of the crew had died,
and the number of sick increased daily. The remnant were worn out
with the hardships of the voyage, and barely able to do the incessant
pumping necessary to keep their leaky vessels afloat. Their
provisions were running short, and there was still no faintest sign
of land. Disappointed and dejected, the commanders and ships' council
reluctantly resolved to give up a fruitless search. On the 25th
October they turned their ships for Formosa to obtain refreshment for
the sick, and to refit. Taking the coast of Japan on their way, they
came to an anchor on the 24th November, before Fort Zealandia, on the
island of Tayouwan or Formosa, then a Dutch possession. They had been
nearly six months at sea, and out of a crew of ninety had lost nearly
forty men. No further search was ever made for the wonderful
island.</p>

<p>In the following year Tasman made another voyage to Japan, this
time for the purposes of trade, as skipper of the fly-ship
<i>Oostkappel</i> (<i>Eastchapel</i>). The fleet with which he sailed
consisted of eleven ships, carrying freight valued at &pound;525,000;
The Oostkappel's cargo alone was worth &pound;80,000. This gives us
an idea of the value of the Japan trade. The Hollanders were now the
only Europeans allowed to trade with the country. The Portuguese had
for nearly a century carried on a most profitable trade, but their
arrogance and intrigues, and above all the proselytising zeal of the
Jesuit missionaries--who had made many thousand converts, and
acquired an enormous influence--excited the jealousy and hostility of
the Government. Christianity was suppressed: Foreigners were excluded
from the Empire, and only allowed to trade with Firando and Nagasaki.
In 1639 an insurrection led to a general massacre of the Christians,
and the absolute expulsion of the Portuguese under pain of death.</p>

<p>The <i>Oostkappel</i> arrived at Firando on 25th August, 1640, and
lay there for some three months. During her stay the Dutch got into
serious trouble with the Japanese Government and were compelled to
demolish their factory, which was too much like a fort to satisfy the
susceptibilities of the Imperial Government. Mr. Lauts has given us
the resolutions of the Council of the Dutch Factory at Firando in
1640. When the Imperial rescript arrived, Tasman, in virtue of his
commission as captain of the <i>Oostkappel</i>, sat as a member of
the Council, and signed its resolutions, The situation was most
perilous,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 14}</u></p>

<p>but Francis Caron, the president of the Council, returned the
prudent answer: "All that His Imperial Majesty is pleased to command,
we will punctually obey." Still the Dutch were slow in proceeding
with the work of demolition, and it was not until another Imperial
rescript arrived, threatening to put the members of the Council to
death if the order was not instantly obeyed, that the great stone
factory--which had cost the Dutch 100,000 guilders to build--was
finally levelled to the ground. They were compelled to submit to the
most vexatious restrictions, and to put up with countless
humiliations in order to maintain their position. But the trade was
too valuable to be lightly relinquished, and by their submission the
Dutch alone of European nations for more than 200 years managed to
retain trade relations with Japan, though living as the Japanese said
"like frogs in a well," until in 1853 the American squadron under
Commodore Perry broke in upon Japanese isolation and paved the way
for that remarkable revolution, the latest development of which we
have seen in the recent war between Japan and China.</p>

<p>In May, 1641, Tasman sailed from Batavia to take in a cargo at
Lauwek, the capital of Cambodia, and then to proceed to Japan. The
Cambodian Kingdom at that time extended over a great portion of
south-eastern Further India, now Cochin China. Its capital, Lauwek,
on the great river Cambodia, was one of the most important cities of
the east; it was the centre of a great trade in furs, ivory, silk
stuffs, and other merchandise, which were brought from the interior
and from China and exported to Japan and other places. The Dutch, as
the price of assistance given to the King in some of his wars, had a
few years previously obtained leave to set up a factory at Lauwek,
which was of great value to them in the Japan trade. For this factory
Tasman sailed in his ship the Oostkappel, and in July came to an
anchor in the Lauwek Roads. On his arrival he found the Dutch and
Portuguese in violent conflict. A few days before a dispute had
arisen between the crew of the Dutch fly-ship <i>Zaijer</i> arid the
Portuguese, and this, through the overbearing arrogance of the
latter, had grown into a fight, and had cost some of the Dutch their
lives. The Directors of the factory had appealed to the King to
punish the offenders, but the Portuguese having won him over by
bribes were only sentenced to pay a fine. This blood-money the Dutch
refused with contempt, and since neither by entreaty nor in any other
way could they obtain a juster sentence, they resolved to exact
satisfaction themselves. At this critical juncture Tasman made his
appearance at La uwek, and as he lacked neither the courage nor the
inclination to avenge the murder of his countrymen, he soon found
an</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 15}</u></p>

<p>opportunity of inflicting an exemplary punishment on the enemy.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>Since their expulsion from Japan the Portuguese had contrived to
keep a share of the trade by importing their wares under the
Cambodian flag. On the <i>Oostkappel's</i> arrival, a rich cargo of
silks from Macao (the Portuguese settlement at the mouth of the
Canton River) was being transhipped into two junks flying the
Cambodian flag in order to be sent to Japan. Tasman had express
instructions to attack and make prizes of all Spanish, Portuguese,
and other foreign ships not provided with free passes from the Dutch
Company giving them permission to trade. He therefore rapidly
discharged his cargo, loaded for Formosa, and then weighed anchor and
cruised outside the river to look out for the Portuguese junks. A few
days after leaving the river the junks hove in sight, and Tasman gave
chase. He soon overhauled one of them, and after a sharp fight the
junk surrendered, and her silks, worth 5500 dollars, were transferred
to the <i>Oostkappel</i>. The other junk (with a cargo worth 5000
dollars), aided by the gathering darkness, succeeded in escaping, and
Tasman, abandoning further pursuit, proceeded with his spoil to
Formosa. His conduct in this matter did not, however, meet with the
approval of the authorities at Batavia, arid Abel, for his alleged
negligence in not capturing the second junk, was condemned to forfeit
two months' wages. On leaving Formosa, the <i>Oostkappel</i> was
overtaken by a violent storm. She lost her mainmast, and was so
disabled that the ship's council judged it impossible to proceed with
the voyage to Japan. The ship therefore made for Formosa, and after a
most perilous voyage contrived to reach. Fort Zealandia. Here the
cargo for Japan was transhipped to the <i>Zaijer</i>, and the
<i>Oostkappel</i> was sufficiently repaired to be able to sail under
jury rig with a cargo of silks for Batavia, where she arrived on 20th
December.</p>

<p>Although Tasman, as we have said, was fined two months' wages for
dereliction of duty in allowing the Portuguese junk to escape him, it
would appear that this was but a necessary part of the rigid
discipline of the Company, and involved no real disgrace. His voyage
with Quast in search of the "golden island" had tested his qualities
of hardihood and endurance; his voyages to Japan had proved his skill
and resource in seamanship; his services in the Banda Sea, and his
smart action at Lauwek (in spite of nominal blame) had shown his
courage and capacity, and his zeal and determination as a stout
upholder of the rights and privileges--not to say of the arrogant
assumptions--of the Company. Van Diemen,</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Voormeulen van Boekeren, p. 33.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 16}</u></p>

<p>ever on the watch for capable and resolute men who could further
his plans for the extension of Dutch supremacy in the East, had
recognised Abel's great qualities. This is plain from the important
enterprises with which he was constantly entrusted. So little did his
failure to capture the junk affect his standing, that within three or
four months after the infliction of the fine the Governor-General
offered him the conduct of an important mission, in which not only
his resolution but his diplomatic skill would be put to proof.
Amongst other countries in which the Dutch had early established
themselves was the great island of Sumatra. They had soon elbowed out
the Portuguese, and now had factories at Acheen, Djambi, and other
places. The most important of these was at Palembang (not far from
the coasts of Java.) This post commanded the pepper trade of the
south of the island. The powerful Sultan of Palembang had long been
on most friendly terms with the Dutch, but through the machinations
of a Chinese named Bencki, who had fled from Batavia in debt to the
Company, and had managed to ingratiate himself with the Sultan, these
relations were seriously imperilled. The differences and
misunderstandings which had arisen now threatened to end in war. It
was with the view of bringing the Sultan to a better mind that Tasman
was despatched to Palembang with a fleet of four vessels. He left
Batavia on 23rd April, 1642, and two or three days later the little
squadron cast anchor in the mouth of the river on which the Sultan's
capital was situated. Here, by way of preliminary, Abel Jansz took
possession of some junks loaded with pepper, and having transferred
their cargoes to his own vessels, he sailed up the river to
Palembang. His instructions were to do his best to arrange matters by
friendly means before having recourse to hostile measures. He
therefore sought an interview with the Sultan. To the surprise of the
Dutch, the audience was not only granted, but the ambassador met with
a most friendly reception. Abel showed himself a skilful diplomatist.
He disabused the Sultan's mind of the prejudices instilled by the
Chinaman, and dwelt on the good disposition of the government at
Batavia. He showed the importance, not only to the Company but also
to the kingdom of Palembang, of the maintenance of the trade and of
the amicable relations hitherto existing. Finally he urged, in
forcible terms, the mischief that would ensue from a war between the
two hitherto friendly powers. It is perhaps doubtful whether the
diplomatist's words would have been as convincing if they had not
been supported by the tangible argument of a squadron of ships,
commanded by a man who clearly was not to be trifled with. But,
however that may be, the Sultan was</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 17}</u></p>

<p>completely won over, and without further hesitation renewed the
treaty of friendship. Tasman's mission being thus successfully
completed, he returned with his fleet to Batavia, carrying with him
the obnoxious Chinaman, and was received by Van Diemen and his
Council with the warmest acknowledgments for his services in having
extricated them from what had at one time threatened to. be a very
serious trouble.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03"></a>III.--THE GREAT DISCOVERY VOYAGES TO THE
SOUTH-LAND, 1642-1644.</h2>

<h4>1. <i>The Unknown South Land.</i></h4>

<p>Tasman was now in his fortieth year. In ten years' wanderings and
fightings in the service of the Company he had grown enured to
hardships and danger. He was familiar with the great trade routes
from Europe to India, with the intricacies of the waters of the
Eastern Archipelago, and with the navigation of the Seas of China and
Japan. He had sailed a thousand miles beyond the limits reached by
any previous navigator into the unknown and mysterious regions of the
cold and stormy North Pacific Ocean. In his many voyages he had
proved himself a keen trader, a capable and daring seaman, a bold
fighter, and an able commander. He was now ready to undertake the
great adventure, the crowning achievement of his adventurous
life--that voyage to the Great Southland, which, as a Dutch historian
says, "must specially immortalise him; the expedition which must ever
give him an honorable place amongst the greatest navigators and
discoverers."</p>

<p>The Great Unknown Southern Continent--Terra Australis Incognita,
or Nondum Cognita--had for ages been the dream of geographers. The
ancient cosmographers had formulated a theory as to the existence of
a huge continent in the south, which they considered necessary to
balance the large continents in the northern hemisphere. The
discovery of North and South America only lent fresh weight to this
conjecture, and it was commonly supposed in the 16th and 17th
centuries--and indeed was almost an article of faith--that below the
Equator there was a huge continent which had still to be discovered
and explored.</p>

<p>It was in 1513 that the Spaniard Vasco Nunez de Balboa first saw
the Pacific from a mountain in Panama. Ferdinand Magellan was the
first to enter it. Leaving Spain in 1519, with five small ships of
from 130 to 60 tons, this heroic navigator felt his way through the
Strait which bears his name, and crossing the great ocean, after
months of suffering reached the Ladrones. He himself was killed at
the Philippines, but</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 18}</u></p>

<p>one of his ships, the <i>Victoria</i>, with a handful of men,
returned to Spain, after a voyage lasting three years, having been
the first to circumnavigate the globe. Magellan voyage was prompted
by the desire of Spain to find a way to the Moluccas on the west,
with the object of disputing the claims of Portugal, and wresting
from her the spice trade. With a similar object, the Spanish Viceroys
of Mexico and Peru dispatched various expeditions to the Moluccas. In
one of these voyages in 1528, Saavedra, sent out by Cortez, sighted
New Guinea, which had previously been seen by the Portuguese. In
1564, the Philippines were colonised by the Spaniards. In another
voyage, in 1568 Mendana discovered the Solomons, and brought to Peru
such a glowing account of their wealth that in 1595 he was dispatched
with a fleet to found a settlement there. He failed, however, to find
the islands, and unsuccessfully attempted to plant a colony on Santa
Cruz. Fernandoz do Cuiros, his pilot on the voyage, was firmly
persuaded that here at last was the great Terra Australis. He
petitioned the King of Spain to be allowed to colonise it, and in his
memorial "it is soberly affirmed to be a terrestrial paradise for
wealth and pleasure". He declares that the country abounds in fruit
and animals, in silver and pearls, probably also in gold, and is
nothing inferior to Guinea in the land of Negroes. In 1605 Cuiros set
out from Peru with a powerful fleet, to settle a plantation in the
southern paradise. On a large island which he discovered, and which
he took to be part of the southern continent, and named Australia del
Espiritu Santo--it is in fact one of the New Hebrides--he founded the
short lived and unfortunate town of New Jerusalem. One of his
companions, Louis Paz de Torres, separated from the fleet and steered
westwards, sailing through the Strait which now bears his name, and
skirting the south coast of New Guinea. The first Englishman to enter
the Pacific was Sir Francis Drake. In his "Famous Voyage" in 1577 he
stole through Magellan Strait, fell upon and plundered the Spanish
settlements in Peru, and, following Magellans track across the South
Sea, made the Moluccas, and returned to England laden with booty. In
the latter part of the 16th and early part of the 17th centuries,
several Dutch navigators accomplished similar circumnavigation. All
these expeditions crossed the Pacific near the Equator, and though
they discovered islands they threw no light on the problem of the
Terra Australis. More important was the voyage of the Dutch
navigators LeMaire and Schouten in 1616. They found a new passage
into the South sea, between Tierra del Fuego and Staatenland. Sailing
through the Strait of LeMaire, they reached the open ocean,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 19}</u></p>

<p>doubled Cape Horn, and crossed the Pacific at a higher latitude
than Magellan and Drake. Being so far to the south as 17&deg; S
latitude, they confidently expected to fall in with the Great South
Land, but were constantly disappointed, finding nothing but a few
islands. LeMaire's ships, on reaching Batavia after their long
voyage, were seized and confiscated by his countryman
Governor-General Cohen, for having come into the Indies in violation
of the charter of monopoly of the Dutch Est India Company. This
damped the ardour of explorers for many years, so much son that for
nearly a century no Dutch navigator ventured again to attempt the
circumnavigation of the globe.</p>

<p>These various expeditions had somewhat circumscribed the possible
area within which the south land might be found. Still the old
cartographers found the idea of a sea full of island so little in
harmony with their prepossessions, that in the early part of the 17th
C (even so late as 1640) they boldly drew on their maps of the world
a huge Terra Australis Nondum Cognita. This was depicted as
surrounding the South Pole, and occupying a very considerable portion
of the Southern Hemisphere. In the South Atlantic the Promontorium
Terrae Australis jutted northwards toward Africa. On the West only
the narrow Straits of Magellan and LeMaire broke its continuity with
South America and gave the sole means of passage into the South Sea.
On the eastern side this continent of the mapmakers blocked all
access to the Pacific. It extended in a solid but gradually narrowing
mass from the pole up to the very Equator. In this respect the maps
were a jumble, compounded of discoveries, actually made but
imperfectly known, fitted onto a baseless theory. It is pretty
certain that Portuguese ships sailing from the eastern archipelago
had somewhere between 1512 and 1542 seen the northwest coast of
Australia and that these discoveries were vaguely indicated on some
of the early charts. They appeared on the cartographers maps as the
land Beach, exceedingly rich in gold. New Guinea had been sighted by
the Portuguese, Maneses in 1511, and again by the Spaniard Saavedra
in 1528; therefor Nova Guinea appeared as the most northerly
extension as the continent under the Equator--sometimes as an island
separated by a narrow strait, sometimes as an integral part of the
continent itself. Beyond New Guinea it is probable that the reported
discovery by the Portuguese of certain vague and imperfectly known
lands forming part of the coast of Australia justified the
delineation of the north eastern shores of the continent. But from
the point where information failed, imagination stepped in, boldly
carrying the coastline from Queensland down in a south-easterly
direction</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 20}</u></p>

<p>to Magellan Strait and Cape Horn, and filling the South Pacific
with an imaginary continent.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>When the Dutch had established themselves in the eastern
Archipelago, their spirit of enterprise and adventure, and their
ambition to win new realms for the Companies trade, were only
stimulated by their unprecedented success. It became an object of
ardent desire to the home directors, the Council of Seventeen, and to
the successive Governors-General of the Indies, to explore the
mystery of the Great Southland; if per chance they might there find a
second Mexico or Peru, rich in Gold or Silver or new spice islands,
to increased the profits of their trade, or, at the least, to
discover a direct way from the eastern possessions, by the Great
South Sea, to Peru and Chili, which would make it easy for them to
harass and plunder the Spanish ships and the settlements of South
America. It was in 1605--only three years after the foundation of the
company--that the first attempt was made; and the object of this
expedition was limited to the exploration of the regions lying to the
east of the Banda islands. With this view, the <i>Duyfke</i>
(<i>Little Dove</i> or <i>Darling</i>) sailed from Batavia in 1605,
visited the island of Aru, sailed along the south coast of New Guinea
and reached Cape Keer Weer, in 13&deg; S latitude on the east side of
the Gulf of Carpentaria--her captain thinking, however, that he was
still on the west coast of New Guinea.</p>

<p>For a number of years the want of suitable vessels which could be
spared from the needs of the east India settlements, and the
hostilities in which they were constantly involved with their
European rivals in the spice trade, coupled with thew necessity of
consolidating their power in the Eastern Archipelago, prevented the
Colonial authorities from engaging in distant adventures. The first
Dutch discoveries on the west coast of Australia were not the result
of design, but were accidental--or, at least, unpremeditated.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The prepossession in favour of a Southern Continent
was inveterate in the 17th and 18th centuries. When Tasman made the
west coast of New Zealand he was confident that at last he had
discovered the west side of the long-sought Terra Australis Incognita
So late as 1771, Alexander Dalrymple--the Hydrographer to the
Admiralty, and the jealous rival of Cook--published a collection of
voyages to the South Sea with the express object of demonstrating the
existence of a huge Southern Continent. The only part of the Pacific
then unexplored was that lying between New Zealand and Magellan
Strait. This gave nearly the area which, by elaborate calculation,
Dalrymple showed was necessary to preserve the equilibrium of land
between the northern and southern hemispheres. He therefore concluded
that this space south of the Equator must be almost entirely solid
land. Within four years of the publication of Dalrymple's work, Cook
in his second voyage, by sailing over the site of the imaginary
continent, finally dissipated the fable, and reduced the Terra
Australis Incognita to the frozen mass within the Antarctic
circle.]</blockquote>

<p>When the Hollanders first made their way to the east Indies they
naturally followed the old routes taken by their Portuguese
predecessors and rivals. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope, they
shaped their course, either inside or outside of Madagascar, and
thence made their way as best they could--either north to India or
east to Java. This rout had many disadvantages. Numerous rocks and
islands, the positions of which were imperfectly known, lay in the
track, and were a constant source of danger. The south-east Trade
Winds drove the ships to the northward, and, as they got into the
tropics, they met with light, variable, and baffling winds, which
delayed them for long weeks, so that it was no uncommon thing for the
outward voyage to last 13 months. Nor was the loss of time, and
consequent damage to cargo the only evil. Scurvy--the scourge of all
early voyages--produced by the long and exclusive use of salt diet,
attacked the crews. Many died, and the survivors arrived at their
destination broken down by sickness, and often short of provisions
and water.</p>

<p>Bad as the Madagascar route was, the Dutch, for more than 15
years, were unable to find a better. At last, however, in December,
1611, commander Hendrik Brouwer, who had sailed with two ships from
Holland to the east, wrote to the Council of Seventeen reporting his
arrival at Java. After leaving the Cape, he had run due east in about
36&deg; S latitude for some 3000 miles. He had kept a strong westerly
wind for 28 days, and had reached Batavia after a passage of less
than seven months, having lost only two men from sickness. This was
unprecedented; and he strongly advised that all outward bound ships
should be ordered to take the south route, by which they might make
sure of short passages--seeing that if they failed to get west winds
in 36&deg; S, they would be certain to do so if they ran to 40&deg;
or 44&deg; S. Although the long distance run to the south seemed a
disadvantage, it was largely compensated for by the gain of running
down the easting in a high latitude. It was open sea all the way in
this Great Southern Ocean, with none of the rocks and dangers which
beset the northern route and the coolness of the weather was of great
importance to the health of the crews.</p>

<p>In consequence of Brouwers report, seconded by the recommendation
of Governor-General Cohen, the Directors ordered their outbound ships
to take the new route. Rewards were offered for quick passages--150
Guilders for a passage under 9 months, 600 Guilders if they arrived
within seven months. The superiority of the new route was soon
apparent. Of three ships sailing at the same time from Holland in
1614, the <i>Hardt</i> took Brouwers route and reached Batavia in six
months, while the two others by the Madagascar</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 22}</u></p>

<p>passage were 16 and 18 months in making the voyage. It was in
running far east under the new sailing directions that in 1616 the
ship <i>Eendragt</i> (<i>Concord</i>) first sighted the south land
(the west coast of Australia) in 26&deg; S latitude at Shark Bay; her
captain Dirk Hartog landing on an island which still bears his name
and putting up an inscribed metal plate, which remained there up to
the early part of the present century. The voyage was not without
danger, as an English ship, the <i>Tryal</i>, found to her cost; for,
following the new Dutch route in 1621 she ran onto the Trial rocks in
20&deg; S latitude and was totally wrecked, only a few of her crew
succeeding in reaching Batavia in the boats.</p>

<p>From Hartog's ship, the new discovery received the name of
Eendragt Land and in the next four or five years the captains of
other ships on the same voyage sighted the west coast, amongst them
Edel and Houtman, who in 1619 made the South Land in 32.5&deg; S
latitude--north of the present site of Perth--and sailed along it
some hundreds of miles, giving it the name of Edel Land, and also
naming Houtmans Abrolhos.</p>

<p>Instructions were issued by the directors in 1620 and 1621 that
outward bound ships leaving the Cape should keep an east course
between 30&deg; and 40&deg; S latitude for 4000 miles, or until they
should sight the New South Land of the Eendragt'. With our modern
notions these instructions appear extraordinary, but in the then
existing state of navigation they were practical and well judged. The
appliances at the command of ships captains in those days were very
imperfect. Without the sextant or the chronometer there was the
greatest difficulty in determining the ships position. It is true
that they could find the latitude by the cross-staff with reasonable
accuracy, but they had no means of finding the longitude except by
the rude process of dead reckoning by the log. They had no reliable
charts, and had to depend very largely on their own personal
experience of former voyages or on the advice of pilots who had
sailed the seas before. It was therefor no uncommon thing at the end
of a long voyage for the captain to find himself some hundreds of
miles out of his reckoning--sometimes even as much as 400 or 600
miles. Thus Brouwer, in the voyage above mentioned--made Sumatra,
when according to his estimated position on the chart he was still
320 miles to the westward of the island. The object of the new
instructions was, therefore, to enable the ships to ascertain their
position after the long run to the east. When they made the South
Land they ran north along the coast until they reached the known
point of Eendragt Land in 25&deg; or 26&deg; S latitude. From this
they took a new departure, and by steering an N.N.W.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 23}</u></p>

<p>course they could make pretty sure of striking the south coast of
Java. The new plan lead to several ships sighting various parts of
the west coast of Australia in the course of the next 6 or 7 years.
Amongst others, the dispatch <i>Leeuwin</i> (<i>Lioness</i>), in 1622
doubled the Cape to which she gave her name. Even by the new route
the voyage to the Indies was often very protracted, the
<i>Leeuwin</i> for instance, taking 13 months to reach Batavia. There
was also the danger of overshooting the mark, as Pieter Nuyts found
(1627) when in the <i>Gulde Zeepart</i> (<i>Golden Seahorse</i>) he
found himself at the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis at the head
of the Great Australian Bight, and had to coast back some hundreds of
miles until he could round Cape Leeuwin.</p>

<p>The new discoveries quickly attracted quickly the attention and
interest not only of the Colonial Government but of the Home
Directors, and were a frequent subject of correspondence between the
Council of Seventeen and their Governors-General. Cohen respecting
the discovery of a great land situate to the south of Java reported
by the ship <i>Eendragt</i>, Commanders Houtman, Edel, and others,
recommending that ships should be sent to examine it and report on
its inhabitants and resources, and the opening it might offer for
profitable trade; and also to try to find a passage eastward into the
Great South Sea. Accordingly in the next few years several attempts
at systematic exploration were made, but with little success. The
only result was the discovery by the ships <i>Pera</i> and
<i>Arnhem</i>, in 1623, of a portion of the north coast of Australia
(now part of the Northern Territory of South Australia), which was
named Arnhem Land and the naming of the Golf of Carpenteria, after
the Governor-General Carpentier.</p>

<p>One further addition to the knowledge of these coasts was made by
DeVitt, whose ship, the <i>Vianen</i>, leaving the East Indies in
January 1628, in the north-west monsoon, was driven onto the north
west coast of Australia, about the Kimberly district, and who named
the country DeVitt Land.</p>

<p>The total result of these various discoveries and explorations was
that the coast of Australia, from Cape York on the North to the
center of the Great Australian Bight on the south, had been traced
more or less continuously by Dutch ships in the twelve years between
1616 and 1628. This coast was now called by the Dutch "The Known
South Land" to differentiate it from those unexplored and
supposititious regions for which, with practical sense they retained
the old appellation of "The unknown South Land." Down to very recent
times, the names of these early Dutch discoveries were retained on
the maps of Western Australia. Half a century ago, when across</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 24}</u></p>

<p>the center of Australia was written the simple word "Unexplored,"
almost the only names appearing on the western coast were those given
two hundred years before by the captains of the ships of the Dutch
East India Company in the early years of the 17th C. Beginning with
Nuyts Land in the great Australian Bight, and going north, we had
Leeuwin Land, Edel Land, Eendragt Land, DeVitt Land, and Arnhem land.
A few names still remain as evidence of the Dutch discoveries--Cape
Leeuwin, Houtmans Abrolhos, Dirk Hartog's Island, and the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>

<p>Such was the state of Dutch knowledge of Australia when Antony van
Diemen became Governor-General of the Dutch Indies, in the year 1636.
Van Diemen was one of the most notable of the many notable men who
served the east India Company in the early years of its power. Being
involved in debt, he had gone to the Indies, either to escape his
creditors or to retrieve his fortunes. He showed so much capacity
that he was appointed Secretary to Governor-General Coen. From this
time his rise was rapid. In 1626 he became one of the Councillors of
the Indies, and, after important services, he was appointed
Governor-General, in 1636.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>He came to his government at a time when the Dutch power had been
so firmly consolidated by Coen, Carpentier, Brouwer, and others of
his predecessors in office, that the Dutch were undisputed masters of
the Eastern Archipelago, and had a virtual monopoly of the trade.
Free from the difficulties with the native powers, and foreign
rivals, which had embarrassed his predecessors, he had the leisure
and the means to prosecute new enterprises. His zeal for discoveries
which might bring increased wealth and power to his company was
unbounded, and as shown not only by his frequent dispatches on the
subject top the Council of Seventeen in Holland, but by the
expeditions, which he planned and sent out during the term of his
nine years government.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the first attempts at exploration from
the Dutch East India Settlements were directed to the regions east of
the Banda Sea, and had for their chief object the exploration of New
Guinea, and especially the determination of the question whether New
Guinea and the known South Land formed one continent, or whether
there was a strait between them by which access could be gained to
the Great South Sea. It was to the solution of this problem that Van
Diemen first applied himself in the very year in which he received
his appointment as Governor-General, ignorant of the fact that the
Spaniard Torres had already solved the</p>

<blockquote>[*1) Du Bois: <i>Vies des Gouverneurs
G&eacute;n&eacute;raux.</i>]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 25}</u></p>

<p>problem by sailing through the strait that now bears his name, in
the year 1606.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>In the year 1636 Van Diemen dispatched two ships from Banda under
the command of Captain Gerrit Thomasz Pool, with instructions to
proceed along the south coast of New Guinea. If, contrary to all
expectation, a strait was found between New Guinea and the South
Land, Pool was to sail through it and trace, if possible, the east
coast of the Known South Land, circumnavigating it and returning home
along Nuyts Land and Eendragt Land. If, however, as seemed most
probable, New Guinea was joined to the Known South Land, he was to
sail along the northern and western coast of Australia as far south
as Houtmans Abrolhos, searching all the way for any possible passage
to the Pacific. More particularly was he to search the more northerly
parts, as it was presumed that a strait was more likely to be found
in that quarter than further south, where the South Land was
presumably much wider. If Pool with some of his crew had not been
murdered by the savages of New Guinea, it is possible that he might
have assailed through the strait already traversed by Torres, and
have anticipated Captain Cook in the discovery of New South Wales. As
it happened, however, the ships returned without having discovered
anything of importance. In the same year Van Diemen planned the
expedition to search for the supposed "golden island", east of Japan,
which three years later was undertaken by Quast and Tasman, with the
result we have already seen.</p>

<h4>2. <i>The Planning of the Great Discovery Voyage</i></h4>

<p>Governor Van Diemen's heart was now set on a complete exploration
of the Unknown South Land, in which he hoped to discover a new Peru,
rich in silver and gold, or at the least fertile countries inhabited
by civilised people, in which might be found new and as yet undreamed
of commodities to bring fresh wealth into the already overflowing
coffers of the East India Company. For some years domestic troubles
and the want of suitable ships delayed the execution of his plans;
but in the year 1641 he writes to the Council of seventeen:--"We are
very desirous to make discovery of the South Land. The fly-ship
<i>Zeehaen</i> was intended for this service, but through the strange
delay of the ships from Persia and Suratte we were compelled to
employ this same <i>Zeehaen</i> for the last voyage to Taiwan and
Japan. Moreover, we have kept here in the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 26}</u></p>

<p>harbour idle, as much to his vexation as to our own, the renowned
pilot Frans Visscher, whom we intend to employ for the discovery of
the South Land; however, this shall, as we hope, be effected once for
all".</p>

<p>This same Frans Jacobszoon, <i>alias</i> Visscher, took an
important part as the adviser of the Governor-General Van Diemen in
his plans for the projected voyage of discovery. Visscher was a
native of Flushing, and had been for many years in the service of the
company. He had repeatedly made the outward and homeward voyages. In
1623, as mate of the ship <i>Hope</i>, he had sailed around the world
in the celebrated Nassau fleet, under the command of L'Hermite and
Schapenham. He had traded in the east for many years, chiefly in the
Japan trade, and was thoroughly acquainted with the coast of Tonquin,
Chine and Formosa. In those days, when navigation had not been
reduced to a science, and charts were either wanting or not to be
depended on, the Dutch captains in the uncharted seas had to place
their chief reliance for safe and prosperous voyages on the personal
experience of those officers and seamen who in former voyages had
gained a knowledge of the coasts and rocks, the currents, and the
winds of the seas they were traversing. These pilots, for the most
part, were jealous of their knowledge, and indisposed to make it
public, notwithstanding the repeated complaints and injunctions of
the company. Amongst these pilots, Visscher, from his long and varied
experience, and from his skill and capacity, was one of the most
renowned. His knowledge and experience were freely placed at the
disposal of the company, as is often made matter of honourable
mention in the despatches of the Governor-General. He had made charts
of the coasts and islands of the China Seas, of Formosa, the
Piscadores, and Japan, and is continually referred to as one of the
best chart-makers of his time. It was this man that van Diemen
consulted on the projected expedition, and, as we have seen, for this
purpose he detained him-very much to Visschers chagrin in these
stirring times-for nine months in idleness in Batavia, for the
benefit of his advice.</p>

<p>In January, 1642, Visscher wrote a report to the Governor-General
on the proposed discovery of the Unknown South Land. The report is a
masterly document, and gives us a high idea not only of Visschers
practical ability and knowledge as a seaman, but also of his sagacity
and sound judgment. The old pilot wastes no words on fanciful
speculations about the unknown South Land. He goes straight to the
point, states the conditions necessary for success, discusses
possible difficulties, and, in short and concise terms, lays down a
clearly defined and carefully thought out scheme--or rather
choice</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 27}</u></p>

<p>of schemes--for exploring both the Unknown and Known South Lands,
and, indeed, for obtaining a knowledge of the whole southern
world.</p>

<p>The report begins with a recommendation that the expedition should
leave Batavia in August, when they would have the most favourable
winds, and have the whole of the summer before them, with long days
and good weather. From Batavia the ships should first proceed to
Mauritius, then a Dutch possession. As the expedition was intended to
go to the east, this, at first sight, seems a strange recommendation.
But there were good grounds for the advice. Visscher, as we shall
see, had certain reasons for wishing to make the point of departure
as far to the west as possible. Mauritius, moreover, was easily
reached with the south-east trades, and when there the ships would
have run down nearly a thousand miles of their southing, and would
have a comparatively short distance to run to the south before
reaching the region of the westerly winds, on which they must depend
for success. Moreover, at Mauritius, and this is the only reason
explicitly stated in the report, they could conveniently take in
wood, water, and other supplies necessary for the voyage.</p>

<p>Leaving Mauritius early in October, the ships were to get away
south as quickly as possible to 51&deg; or 54&deg; south latitude, or
until they fell in with land. From this point they should run due
east upon the same latitude to the longitude of the east end of New
Guinea, and then steer a course north by west until they got new
Guinea on board; or else they might run further to the east to the
supposed longitude of the Solomon Islands--or perhaps 500 or 700
miles beyond--then steer north-explore those islands--where,
according to all accounts, they would find many things worth their
trouble--and return by the north coast of New Guinea to Banda or
Amboyna.</p>

<p>But Visscher had an alternative scheme, or rather a combination of
two schemes, by which a much more complete exploration could be made.
If an exploring expedition was fitted out in Holland, the ships might
make the Cape of Good Hope, and thence sail south to latitude 54&deg;
S., or make Rio de Janeiro, and begin from the east side of Staaten
Land, near Cape Horn; in either case running east to the longitude of
the Solomon islands, and making the homeward voyage as before. Such a
voyage would give a knowledge of the whole Southern Ocean from Cape
Horn to the Solomon Islands. Of course if land was met with the plans
would be modified, but Visscher apparently had not much faith in the
common belief in a huge southern continent, at least in the Atlantic
and Indian oceans. About the South Pacific he was more doubtful. Here
the difficulty of exploration would be greater. The strong
westerly</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 28}</u></p>

<p>winds prevailing in the latitude of Cape Horn would make it
impossible for any ship to make the voyage to the west in a high
latitude; but if the Dutch had a settlement in Chili, the expedition
might start from there and run up into the tropics with the
south-east trades to latitudes 12* or 15&deg; S., crossing the
Pacific in that latitude until it made the Solomons. If they could
only be sure of getting refreshment at the Solomon Islands this would
be an excellent plan, for they could then sail south from the
Solomons, and getting into westerly winds run back east to the Strait
of Le Maire and Cape Horn.</p>

<p>By the accomplishment of these two voyages, says Visscher, "You
will be able to explore the southern portion of the world round about
the whole globe, and find out what is there; whether it be land or
sea or icebergs--whatever God has ordained to be there". The old
pilots views as to the South Land, and the best means to search for
it, show that he was in advance of his time, and free from many of
the traditional prepossessions then common amongst navigators and
geographers. If the Council of Seventeen could only have been induced
to enter into Visscher's plans, the riddle of the South Land might
have been solved in the 17th C., and the discoveries of Captain Cook
anticipated by more than one hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>These large schemes were beyond the province of the East India
Government, but the plan Visscher had sketched for the expedition
from Batavia was adopted in its entirety. Van Diemen in his
despatches describes the voyage as having been projected on the
advice of Visscher. The resolution of the Governor-General and
Council decreeing the expedition is dated 1st August, 1642. It begins
by stating the great desire of both the colonial and home governments
for the exploration of southern and eastern lands, with the hope of
opening up important areas for trade, or at least finding a more
convenient way to the rich countries already known in South America.
The Governor then states that he has consulted divers persons of
approved judgement in such matters, and especially the renowned and
most experienced pilot Frans Jacobsz Visscher, as to the explorations
and the bets way to accomplish them, and in accordance with their
written opinions has decided to dispatch for the discovery of these
apparently rich countries two ships<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>,
the <i>Heemskerck</i>, with a crew of sixty men, and the fly-ship
<i>Zeehaen</i> (<i>Cormorant</i>), with a crew of fifty. The
expedition to be under the command of the Hon. Abel Tasman, who is
very eager to make the exploration; with him are to</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The <i>Heemskerck</i> was a jagt or small ship,
perhaps 20 tons. The <i>Zeehaen</i> was a fluit or fly-boat, a vessel
of light draught, built for quick sailing; she was smaller than the
<i>Heemskerck</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 29}</u></p>

<p>be associated the said Pilot-Major Visscher and other capable
officers.</p>

<p>The ships were ready for sea. The <i>Heemskerck</i> had for
skipper Ide Tjerxszoon, the <i>Zeehaen</i> Gerrit Janszoon. Tasman as
commander and Visscher as pilot-major were on board the
<i>Heemskerck</i>, Gilsemans the merchant or super-cargo on the
<i>Zeehaen</i>. In all Dutch discovery and trading expeditions the
merchant or supercargo was an important personage. He had the
direction of the commercial part--which in the Company's voyages was
the chief part of the undertaking--and consequently had a large voice
in the direction of the expedition. Gilsemans is spoken of as having
a competent knowledge of navigation and as being also a skilful
draftsman, and it doubtless to his capable pencil that we owe the
vigorous sketches which illustrate the original journal of the
voyage.</p>

<p>The instructions to Tasman were printed by Swart in 1859, and are
entitled "Instructions for the Captain-Commander Abel Janszoon
Tasman, the Pilot-Major Franchoys Jacobsz Visscher, and the Council
on the ship <i>Heemskerck</i> and fly-boat the <i>Zeehaen</i>,
destined for the exploration of the Unknown and Discovered South
Land, the South-Eastern Coast of New-Guinea, with the Islands lying
round about". They begin with an elaborate exordium recounting the
priceless riches, profitable commerce, useful traffic, excellent
dominion, great might and power which the kings of Castile and
Portugal had brought to their crowns by the discovery of America by
Columbus and of the Cape route to the Indies by Vasco de Gama;
likewise what uncounted blind heathen had thus come to the wholesome
light of the Christian religion. Yet hitherto no serious attempt had
been made by any Christian king, prince, or republic to explore the
still unknown part of the globe situated in the south, which might be
supposed to be as great as either the old or the new world, and might
with good reason be expected to contain many excellent and fruitful
countries, and also lands as rich in mines or precious metals as the
gold and silver provinces of Peru, Chili or Sofala. No European
colony was so suitable for the starting-point of such an expedition
as the town of Batavia, situated in the centre of the known and
unknown East India; therefore the Governor and Council of India had
resolved to take the discovery in hand, and to dispatch for that
service the ships <i>Heemskerck</i> and <i>Zeehaen</i>.</p>

<p>The instructions then prescribe the course which the vessels are
to take, following exactly the recommendations of Visschers report,
except that, if the ships council for any sufficient reason thought
it best, they might vary the route by making the east end of the
known South Land, or the islands of St. Peter</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 30}</u></p>

<p>and St. Francis on the Great Australian Bight, and then sailing
due north along the coast, (which it was presumed would turn here to
the north) and try to discover a passage between it and new Guinea.
However, this was not recommended; the course advised being to keep
on south latitude 48&deg; to 54&deg; until 400 to 800 miles east of
the supposed longitude of the Solomon Islands, so as to be assured
there was a way through from the Indies to the South Pacific which
would give a short route to Chili.</p>

<p>Minute directions are given for the survey and description of
lands discovered; observations of winds, currents, and weather;
precautions to be taken in navigation; discipline and rations of the
crews; care in conciliating the natives and avoiding any injury to
them; precautions to be observed against possible treachery when
landing from boats; and injunctions to obtain information as to the
resources of the countries visited, and the possibilities of trade
with them.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this, like other Dutch expeditions, was
essentially commercial. It was no scientific or adventurous thirst
for discovery that prompted these old Dutchmen, but plain practical
business and the hope of profit for the Company. The merchant to whom
was entrusted the management of the commercial venture had a large
voice in the direction of the expedition. Consequently the
instructions are specially precise in their injunctions to enter in
the journal full particulars of the productions of the countries,
what sort of goods the people had for trade, and what they would take
in exchange. For this purpose the ships were laden with a great
variety of articles of merchandise. Gold and silver were specially to
be sought for but, says the Governor-General with cynical candour,
"Keep them ignorant of the value of the same, appear as if you were
not greedy for them; and if gold or silver is offered in any barter,
you must feign that you do not value those metals, showing them
copper, zinc, or lead, as if those minerals were of more value with
us."</p>

<p>Tasman was to hoist his flag on the <i>Heemskerck</i> as commander
of the expedition, and was to preside in the ships council,
consisting of skippers of the two ships, Pilot-Major Visscher, the
chief mates, and the two merchants. The commander had a deliberative
and a casting vote. In the administration of justice the boatswains
were also to be summoned and to have votes. But in all matters which
concerned navigation, such as courses to be steered and the discovery
of lands, the Pilot-Major was to have two votes, and his advice to be
held in proper respect, seeing that the voyage had been projected on
his advice and information. In these matters too, the second mates
were to have votes.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 31}</u></p>

<p>In case of Tasman's death the skipper of the <i>Heemskerk</i>, Ide
Tjerexszoon, was to succeed to the command.</p>

<p>The instructions conclude:--"We command you to the blessing of the
Almighty, whom we pray to endue you with manly courage for the
accomplishment of the proposed discoveries, and to bring you back in
safety, to the increase of His glory, the reputation of the
fatherland, the service of the company, and your own immortal
honour".</p>

<p>They are dated Fort Batavia, 13th August, 1642, and signed by the
Governor-General and his Council--Van der Lyn, Maetzuycker, Schouten,
Sweers, Witsen, and Boreel.</p>

<h4><i>3. The Voyage of 1642.</i></h4>

<p>The next day (14th August) the ships sailed from Batavia, and on
this day Tasman's journal begins as follows:--"Journal or description
by me, Abel Jansz Tasman, of a voyage made from the Town of Batavia,
in the East Indies, for the discovery of the Unknown Southland, in
the year Anno 1642, the 14th August. May it please Almighty God to
grant His blessing thereto! Amen".</p>

<p>Sailing through the Sunda straight, the ships carried the
south-east trades with them to Mauritius, where they arrived 5th
September, after an exceptionally quick passage of 22 days. An entry
in Tasman's journal shows us how hopelessly abroad the best sailors
in those days were in regard to longitude. He says, "By our reckoning
we were still 200 miles to the east of Mauritius when we saw it". And
he mentions the arrival at the same time of another ship, the
<i>Arent</i>, outward bound, which had made the island of Rodrigues
in the belief that it was Mauritius, because it lay in nearly the
same latitude, though 300 miles to the eastward.</p>

<p>They had other difficulties to contend with. A letter from Van der
Stael, the Dutch commandant at Mauritius, to the Governor-General at
Batavia, states that the ships arrived in very bad condition, and
wanting almost everything. The Zeehaen was partly rotten, and in need
of extensive repairs. Both ships were leaky, their rigging was old
and weak, their yards and other spars frequently giving way. To refit
the ships, caulk the seams throughout, strengthen the rigging, cut
and ship spare spars, took the crews nearly a month. Meantime they
took in supplies of water, firewood, and other stores; and added to
their stock of provisions by shooting wild hogs, wild goats, and
other game abounding in the woods. Van der Stel gave to Tasman
journals and maps relating to the Solomon Islands, and vocabularies
of the languages of those islands and of New Guinea. The ships were
ready for sea on</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 32}</u></p>

<p>4th October, but through contrary winds, they could not get out of
the harbour of Fort Fredrik Hendrik until the 8th. Taking a departure
from the south end of Mauritius<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>,
Tasman stood to the southward, getting variable winds to 31&deg; or
32&deg; S, when he came into the westerly winds. Passing far to the
west of St. Pauls and Amsterdam, and between those islands and
Kerguelen, he came, in 43&deg; S, on floating seaweed and other
indications of land. The ships council was called together, and it
was resolved to keep a man constantly on the look-out at the
masthead, and to offer as a reward to whoever should first see land
three reals of eight and a mug of arrack. On 29th October, three
weeks out, he made 46&deg; S latitude, and, meeting with strong gales
and fogs, thought it too dangerous to keep a southerly course for
fear of falling in with land. The course was therefore changed to
nearly east. On 6th November, four weeks out, he reached his highest
latitude, 49&deg; 4' S, seeing many indications of land, which kept
him anxious.</p>

<p>The Pilot-Major now delivered to Tasman an elaborate paper, in
which he carefully discussed the future course of the voyage. He
proposed that they should fall off to 44&deg; S. latitude until they
had passed the 150th meridian<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>, when
he judged that if they had not made the Southern Continent they would
be in open sea. Then they should fall off to 40&deg; S., and sail
east to 220&deg; longitude (about 160&deg; W. according to our
reckoning), which he judged would bring them well to the eastward of
the Solomons, and enable them to make these islands with the
south-east trades-as indeed it would, seeing that this would be about
15&deg; east of the true position of the Solomons.</p>

<p>This resolution was communicated to the <i>Zeehaen</i> by
enclosing the paper in a wooden case, and floating it astern by a
long-line for the <i>Zeehaen</i> to pick up. The councils of both
ships having given their approval, the course was altered
accordingly, and on 18th November they passed the longitude of Nuyts
Land (Great Australian Bight), the furthest known extension of the
discovered South Land. Here they had heavy westerly gales, and
gradually fell off to lat. 42&deg; 25', when on the 24th November,
they sighted their first land, which they called Antony van Diemen's
Land, after the Governor-General.</p>

<blockquote>[*1) AS might be expected, Tasman's longitudes are very
inexact. They are reckoned east from the meridian of the Peak of
Teneriffe. His longitude for the south point of Mauritius, when
reduced to the meridian of Greenwichm is 3&deg; 33' easterly of the
true longitude. Similarly, that of Batavia is 4&deg; 23' too
easterly.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*2) About 130&deg; wast of Greenwich--nearly the
longitude of the head of the Great Australian Bight.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 33}</u></p>

<p>This landfall was somewhere to the north of Point Hibbs, on the
West Coast of Tasmania, probably near the entrance of Macquarie
Harbour--Mounts Heemskerck and Zeehaen<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> being noticeable objects to the north-east.
After standing off for the night, the ships next day made the land
again, approaching within one Dutch mile (i.e. four English miles) of
Point Hibbs. By carefully comparing reckonings the longitude was
fixed at 163&deg; 50'<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>, and a new
departure taken. The wind now came easterly with thick weather, so
that they could not see the land. Rounding South West Cape they got
the wind from the north, and sailed along the south coast. Tasman
named the outlying islands and some peaks on the broken coast, which
he mistook for islands, after members of the council of India--Wit,
Maatsuyker, Sweers, and Boreel. Passing between Pedra Branca and the
main, and rounding the Friars (which he called Boreel Islands), south
of Bruni, Tasman stood up for Adventure Bay, but was caught in a
violent north-west gale, which drove the ships out to sea. From this
incident the bay received its well known name of Storm Bay. Rounding
Tasman's Island on the 1st December, he came to an anchor off what is
now known as Blackman's Bay, but, which Tasman called Fredrik Hendrik
Bay, in honour of the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. His
anchorage was off Green Island, near Cape Frederik Henry on
Forestier's Peninsula. Next day Pilot-Major Visscher was sent in the
<i>Zeehaen's</i> boat through the Narrows to explore Frederik Hendrik
(or Blackman's) Bay. On the 3rd, Tasman with two boats made for a
little bay, now known as Prince of Wales Bay<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*3]</b>, but the wind was so stiff from the
south-east that the <i>Zeehaen's</i> launch with Visscher and
Gilsemans on board had to run back to the ship. The
<i>Heemskerck's</i> longboat with Tasman on board made the bay, but
the surf was too high to allow of landing. The carpenter therefore
swam through the surf, and planting the Prince's flag on shore, took
formal possession of the newly discovered country.</p>

<p>On the 4th December Tasman weighed anchor, intending to sail
northwards along the coast and take in water; the wind, however, was
unfavourable, blowing from the north-west, and being unable to hold
the land aboard, the ship's council resolved to stand away to the
east. After naming Maria Island, Schouten Island, and Van der Lyn
Island (Freycinet</p>

<blockquote>[*1) These mountains were so named by Flinders when he
made the first circumnavigation of Tasmania in the <i>Norfolk</i> in
1798.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*2) East from Teneriffe.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[*3) Mr. Gell thinks that this Prince of wales Bay is the
Frederik Hendrick Bay of Tasman.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 34}</u></p>

<p>Peninsula), he took his departure from "a high round
mountain"--probably St. Patrick's head, or St. Paul's dome<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b>.</p>

<p>Steering due east from the coast of Antony Van Diemen's Land,
after nine days he sighted land again (13th December). This was the
west coast of the South Island of New Zealand, to the south of Cook's
strait.</p>

<p>In an interesting paper by Dr. T. M. Hocken, of Dunedin, on
Tasman's discoveries in New Zealand, it is stated that "the great
high land" that Tasman first saw is situated between Hokitika and
Okarito. Further north the low point described in the journal is
Cook's Cape Foulwind, with its outlying rocks, the Steeples, near
Westport. North of this the Karamea Bight, and the "furthermost
point, which stood out so boldly that we had no doubt that it was the
extreme point", is Cook's Cape Farewell.</p>

<p>Coasting north-eastwards he made a bay on the north coast of the
South Island, where he anchored. Here the Maori's in their war canoes
attacked one of the <i>Zeehaen's</i> boats, killed three of the crew,
and mortally wounded a fourth man. Tasman gave this bay the name of
Moordenaars (or massacre) Bay. He says "This is the second land we
have discovered; we have given it the name of the Staaten Land in
honour of Their Mighty Highnesses the States General, and also
because it may be that this land is joined to Staaten Land (near Cape
Horn), but this is uncertain. It appears to be a very fine country.
Believing that this is the main continent of the Unknown Southland,
we have given this strait the name of Abel Tasman's Passage, as he
has been the first to sail through it".<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*2]</b></p>

<p>Massacre Bay is near the western entrance of Cook's Strait; it is
now called Golden Bay, and the scene of the tragedy, according to Dr.
Hocken, lies close to Parapara.</p>

<p>Although Tasman noted a south-east current and suspected that
there must be a passage, the weather was so bad that he did not stay
to look for it; if he had done so he would have sailed through Cook's
Strait and corrected his idea that he had found the great Southern
Continent. However, he sailed</p>

<blockquote>[*1) * Tasman's longitudes, reduced to the meridian of
Greenwich, are for Point Hibbs, 147&ordm; 11'; for the anchorage off
Green Island, 150&deg; 51'. The true longitudes are 145&deg; 15' and
148&ordm; 1' respectively. The first shows an error of 1&deg; 56',
the second an error of 2&deg; 50', thus making Tasmania too broad by
nearly one whole degree of longitude.<br>

1890, is a paper by the present writer, in which the localities
mentioned by Tasman in his journal are identified and
described.]</blockquote>

<p>north along the west coast of the North Island and sighted the
Three Kings Islands, on which they would have landed to get fresh
water, but were deterred by seeing thirty or forty men of uncommon
stature who showed themselves in a threatening attitude. He did not
land in New Zealand, partly on account of bad weather and partly
owing to the hostile attitude of the Maoris. After rounding the north
of New Zealand he steered north-east after consultation with the
ships council, and found a great swell from the south-east, which
must have made him doubt the existence of the Great Southern
Continent. It did indeed assure him that here was a clear passage to
Batavia to Chili. Still holding a north-east course, on 21st January
he came to several islands, to which he gave the names of Amsterdam,
Middelburg, and Rotterdam, now known as Tongataboo, Eooa, and
Annamooka, part of the Tonga or Friendly Group.</p>

<p>He was very hospitably received by the natives, and after a few
days' stay he weighed anchor (1st February) and after discovering
Willems' Shoals, south-east of Fiji, by the advice of Visscher and
the council he stood north by west to 5&deg; or 6&deg; S. latitude,
and then west for New Guinea. He sailed along the north coast of New
Guinea, and arrived at Batavia on 15th June 1643, after an absence of
ten months, during which he had lost ten men by sickness, besides the
four men killed by the Maoris. His journal concludes thus: "God be
praised and thanked for a safe voyage! Amen".</p>

<h4><i>4. The Voyage of 1644.</i></h4>

<p>Tasman had not, as Van Diemen had hoped, discovered any rich gold
or silver mines, or indeed any rich trade for the Company, but he had
circumnavigated New Holland, or, as he called it on the chart,
"Compagnies Nieuw Nederlandt", and had found a clear way to Chili,
which opened up a good prospect for trade, or at least for great
spoil to be come at from the Spanish settlements in South America.
From this last Governor-General Van Diemen hoped much. On 4th
January, 1644, he wrote to the Home Directory that he contemplated
fitting out a fleet in September to open up a Chili trade and to
plunder the Spaniards in Peru. He also intended to send two or three
ships to make an examination of the newly discovered South Land,
which Tasman had found not possible. For he hoped that such great
countries must contain much that would be profitable for the Company,
and especially gold and silver mines, as in Peru, Chili, and Japan.
But, in the meantime, it would much facilitate the attempts on Chili
and Peru if a shorter passage could be found between New Guinea and
the Known South Land.</p>

<p>This, the Governor-General announced,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 36}</u></p>

<p>was to be immediately undertaken by two ships and a smaller vessel
under the same commanders as before, viz.-Commander Tasman and
Pilot-Major Frans Visscher; Gilsemans was again to be merchant or
supercargo.</p>

<p>On the 13th January, 1644, by resolution of the Governor-general
in Council, the ships <i>Limmen</i> and <i>Zeemeeuw</i> (<i>Sea
Gull</i>), with the little tender <i>Braek</i> (<i>Setter</i>)
carrying only 14 men, were commissioned for the work. They carried a
compliment of 111 hands, and were provisioned for a eight months. On
29th January the instructions for the voyage were drawn up and
signed. They were printed in England by Mr. Major in 1859.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> They contain a most interesting and valuable
summary of former Dutch voyages in the South land. The vessels were
to coast along the south and west coasts of New Guinea to the
furthest discovery in 17&deg; S. latitude (i.e. in the Gulf of
Carpentaria) and endeavour to find a strait or passage into the South
sea. If a strait was found, which might be known by the south-east
swell through it, they were to sail along it and thence as far to the
south-east as the new Van Diemens Land. From thence they were to make
the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, and run along the coast of
the Known South Land to De Wit Land, in 22&deg; S. latitude, when the
known South Land would be circumnavigated and found to be the largest
island in the globe. But if, as was to be presumed, New Guinea was
joined to the South Land, forming one continent, then they were to
run along the coast to 28&deg; S. to the land of Eendragt and
Houtman's Abrolhos, and thence to return to Batavia.</p>

<p>The ships sailed from Batavia the next day, (the 30th December,
1644). The journals of the voyage are lost, and we have only the
briefest notices of the expedition<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>.
But Tasman's chart shows the route of the ships. For some reason or
other, probably on account of the wind, Tasman and Visscher did not
follow the instructions exactly. Instead of sailing first to New
Guinea they made a strait course to the Land of Eendragt. From there
Tasman coasted northwards, and carefully charted, with soundings, the
west and north coasts of Australia, including the Gulf of
Carpentaria. He actually got into the mouth of Torres Strait, but did
not discover the passage. Probably he was deterred from further
examination by the multitude of islands and reefs that block the way,
and was, moreover, ignorant of the fact that the Spaniard Torres</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 37}</u></p>

<p>had in 1606 sailed through the strait from the east. Failing to
find the strait he returned along the coast of New Guinea to Batavia,
where he arrived in August, 1644.</p>

<p>Van Diemen in his dispatch to the Home Directory, the Council of
Seventeen, (23rd December, 1644), reports the result of the voyage,
and expresses his disappointment and discontent that the expedition
had not discovered a strait between New Guinea and the Known South
Land, but only a great bay or Gulf, and also that they had done
nothing but sail along the coasts, and had gained no knowledge of the
country and its productions, alleging as a reason that they were not
strong enough to venture to land in face of the savages. This was
very disappointing, since discoveries were of little use unless the
country was explored at the same time. "For it is certain that as
long as we merely run along the coasts and shores we shall very
slowly open up anything profitable, it being well known to everybody
that the coast people are ordinarily poor, miserable, and evil
disposed; therefore, we must go inland". (Letter: 29 Nov.) Yet, he
says, Tasman in his two voyages had circumnavigated the hitherto
Unknown South Land, which was calculated to have an extent of 8000
miles of coast; and it was very improbable that in so great a
country, with such a variety of climates, there should not be found
something of great importance and profit for the company. There were
also the great northern lands of America, which had been made
accessible by the new discoveries, and every opportunity would be
taken to explore them from time to time by vigilant and courageous
persons; "for", says Van Diemen, "the discovery of new countries is
not work for everyone". "God grant", he concludes, "that in either
one or the other (i.e., in the North America or the South Land) may
be found a rich silver or gold mine, to the satisfaction of those
engaged in the venture, and to the honour of the finders".</p>

<p>It is plain that Van Diemen was dissatisfied with Tasman. He had
looked for immediate results in the extension of trade, or at least
for the finding of the New Guinea strait, and, disappointed in this,
he could not appreciate the importance of the discoveries from a
geographical standpoint.</p>

<p>Tasman's services were recognised somewhat grudgingly. By
resolution of the Governor-General and Council (4th October, 1644)
his salary was raised to 100 florins (&pound;9.6.8) per month, and
the reasons are stated in measured language;--"In which two voyage
(of 1642 and 1644), he has given us reasonable contentment in respect
to his services and the duties he has accomplished. It is therefore
on account of this, at his request, and in consideration of his
ability, also by reason of his having been again about six years in
the country; and,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 38}</u></p>

<p>moreover, that we find in him the spirit to render further good
service to the General Council on like occasions in searching for
rich countries for profitable trade".</p>

<p>IV.--TASMAN'S LATER YEARS, 1644-1659.</p>

<p>Tasman's failure to find what the Governor-General and the East
India Company wanted--immediate and profitable trade--seems to have
brought him under a cloud. He remained at Batavia, but without any
important employment. In October, 1644, he and Frans Visscher laid
down a route for an expedition fitted out to attack the Spanish ships
coming from America to Manilla. But Visscher only was employed on the
expedition, and Martin de Vries in a subsequent one. Tasman was
passed over.</p>

<p>Tasman's failure to find what the Governor-General and the East

brought him under a cloud. He remained at Batavia, but without any
important employment. In October, 1644, he and Frans Visscher laid

<p>Governor-General Van Diemen died in 1645, and with him the era of
great discovery expeditions closed. His successors in the government
were not animated by the same zeal for exploration and adventure, but
devoted their attention to strictly commercial matters, and Tasman
found small opportunity for distinguishing himself. He was not wholly
neglected. He was appointed (2nd November, 1644) a member of the
Council of Justice at Batavia. It seems a somewhat inappropriate post
for a sailor, but the special functions allotted to him may explain
the appointment, for the resolution proceeds, "Commissioning and
qualifying the said Tasman to demand and search for the journals of
all incoming ships, and to report to us therefrom what is proper." He
still held this post in December, 1646, but this did not prevent his
occasional employment on more important and doubtless more congenial
expeditions. Thus, in September, 1646, we find him sailing as Captain
Commander in a mission to Djambi in Sumatra, and in August, 1647,
going to Siam charged with letters from the Company to the King. He
still kept up his relations with the Home Country, as there is
mention on more than one occasion of his remitting sums of money to
Holland. That he was a man of good repute amongst his fellow citizens
is evidenced by the fact that in January, 1648, he was elected an
Elder of the Reformed Congregation at Batavia.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>After four years of comparative inactivity, he was once more
entrusted with an important expedition. On 14th May,</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The Church Consistory at Batavia was a body which
exercised a great influence in the Dutch East Indies. During the time
Tasman sat as a member, a subject much discussed by the Consistory
was a proposal for the suppression of Chinese idolatry, the
destruction of all Chinese temples, and the punishment of the
Priests. In April, 1648, the Consistory sent a Missionary, Dr.
Hambroek, to Formosa, where he was shortly afterwards killed by the
natives.--(Lauts, p. 290.)]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 39}</u></p>

<p>1648, lie took command of a fleet of eight ships, with 1150 men,
which was to proceed to Manilla to lie in wait for the Spanish silver
ships from America, to do what mischief it could to the enemy, and
afterwards to sail to Siam. A further object was the suppression of
the Chinese trade to Manilla and the extension of the Company's
monopoly. The expedition was expected to accomplish great things for
the Company. The Governor-General gave a dinner party to the officers
on the eve of their departure and the fleet left Batavia confident of
success. The result did not justify their hopes. A descent was made
on the island of Luzon (or Manilla), a number of villaes and
monasteries were pillaged and destroyed, and a rich village carried
off, but the main object of the enterprise was not accomplished. The
Chinese trade was not suppressed, neither did the Dutch fleet capture
the silver ships. One of the Dutch vessels was wrecked in a storm,
and the Spanish ships contrived to escape. Tasman reached Siam in
November, and the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia, which
brought to an end the Eighty Years War between Spain and the United
Netherlands, put a stop to further hostilities.</p>

<p>The fleet returned to Batavia in. January, 1649. An incident had
occurred during the expedition which led to Tasman being tried before
the Criminal Court, 23rd November, 1649. It is interesting, as giving
us one of the few personal glimpses we have of the man, and as
showing the severity with which the Company visited the delinquencies
of their most valued officers, and vindicated the right of their
meanest servants to a fair trial even in war time. It must be
confessed that the incident does not present our navigator in a
favourable light. According to the statement of the Advocate Fiscal,
or prosecuting counsel, the facts were as follow:--In August, 1648,
Tasman had landed at the Baviauw Islands with a military force, and
had pitched a camp. He had issued orders that no one was to go
outside the limits of the camp under pain of capital punishment. On
the next day, "after he and some of his officers had all day been
making good cheer at a certain monastery," on their return in the
evening they came upon one of the supernumeraries and another sailor
rambling outside the camp. Tasman was furious. He ordered the
delinquents to be seized, and sentenced them to be hanged on the
spot. He himself prepared the rope, and put it round the neck of the
supernumerary, and made his Vice-Commander, Ogel, climb a tree and
make fast the rope. This done, Tasman himself drew away the bench on
which the man was standing, and left him hanging from the tree. He
then made a rope ready for the second man. Luckily Ogel let go "the
patient," but only just in time. Tasman made some defence,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 40}</u></p>

<p>but the Court set it aside, and decided that not even the
exigencies of war could excuse the Commander for hanging a man
without a trial. The punishment inflicted was exemplary. Tasman was
sentenced to be suspended from his office of Commander during the
Governor-General's pleasure, to pay a. compensation of 1000 reals to
the relatives of the sailor, a tine of 150 reals, and the costs of
suit. In addition to this, he was to stand bareheaded in open Court,
and publicly declare that lie had unjustly and unlawfully, without
form of trial, of his own mere pleasure, and with his own hands,
infamously executed the aforesaid innocent Coenraad Janssen of
Amsterdam. It would appear that he was at the same time removed from
his office in the Church Consistory--at least his name does not
appear in the list of elders for the ensuing year.</p>

<p>The suspension from office lasted two years. In October, 1650, we
find him again employed as Commander, and on the 5th January, 1651,
by a resolution of the Governor-General and Council of India, he was
formally reinstated in his rank, his reappointment to date from the
24th September preceding, when it is said he had again began to serve
the Company.</p>

<p>After this time we have little information about him. It would
appear that he considered his services were not sufficiently
recognised, or at least that lie had grievances which he laid before
the Council of Seventeen in Holland. In October, 1651, the Directors
ordered that a letter of complaint from Abel Jansz Tasman be enquired
into and reported on, but the result of the enquiry does not appear.
In January, 1653, be wrote again to the Directory, the Colonial
authorities curtly noting in the margin, "Abel Jansz Tasman fails to
prove his rash assertions." Whatever his grievance was, it is evident
that he failed to obtain satisfaction, and that it led to his
retirement from the Company's service. The daily journal of Fort
Batavia two months later records, under date 15th March, 1653, the
arrival at Djapara of "Ex-Commander Tasman" in his own private
vessel.</p>

<p>Of his last days we know nothing, except that he was a substantial
and well-to-do citizen of Batavia, living just outside the town on
the Tygersgracht (Tiger Canal), one of the best and wealthiest
quarters, and that lie had considerable landed property. There were
only a few larger landholders in the town, amongst them Francois
Caron, Chief Councillor for India and Director-General, who has been
mentioned as head of the Dutch Factory in Japan in 1640. Lauts found
from a contemporary map of Batavia that Tasman owned a pleasure
garden of nearly six acres in one quarter, and no less than 282 acres
on the Tiger's Canal, where he resided. Nieuwhoff;</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 41}</u></p>

<p>who was in the Indies from 1654 to 1670, says that the handsomest
buildings in Batavia were situated on the Tiger's Canal, which was
planted on both sides with fine trees. Valentyn says: "The view of
this straight canal, so beautifully planted, surpasses anything I
have ever seen in Holland."</p>

<p>On 10th April, 1657, Tasman made his will, which is still
preserved in the Registry of the Probate Court of Batavia. It opens
with the quaint old formula, "In the name of God, Amen!" and states
that the testator is up and about, sick in body, but having good
memory and understanding, and being used to think upon the shortness
of life, that there is nothing more certain than death, and nothing
more uncertain than the hour of the same, he has therefore resolved
to make a solemn testament. First he beqeaths twenty-five guilders to
the poor of Luytgegarst, his native village; secondly to Abel
Heylman, his daughter's son, living in Batavia, a gold cup and
silver-mounted sword. All the remainder of his property he gives to
his beloved wife, Joanna Tjercx. If however she marries again, half
of her bequest is to go over to the children of his only daughter,
Claesjen. If his daughter or her children dispute the will, or
require accounts from the widow, then their half share is to be
reduced to one-fourth (the ordinary legal portion of a child). After
his widow's death the half is to fall to the children of Claesjen;
but as to the widow's half she may use and treat it as her own free
property without contradiction of any.</p>

<p>Tasman had no children by his second wife, Joanna Tjercx. Claesjen
was the daughter of his first wife, Claesgie Heyndricks. Claesjen had
been twice married and had children by both husbands. The first,
Philip Heylman, held an important office in the Fort; the second,
Jacob Breemer, was an officer of the Probate Court of Batavia.</p>

<p>In October, 1659, the will was deposited in the Probate Court of
Batavia; so that Tasman must have died in that year, fifteen years
after his second great voyage.</p>

<p>The great navigators have seldom been long lived. Magellan and
Cook died at fifty-one, Vasco da Gama at fifty-six. Tasman reached
the latter age.</p>

<p>His widow, though forty-seven years old at her husband's death,
did not long remain unconsoled. Eighteen months later, under date 5th
February, 1661, the daily journal of Batavia records that permission
was granted for the marriage of Jan Meynderts Springer, burgher of
Batavia, to Madame Anna Tjerks, widow of the deceased Commander Abel
Tasman, to be celebrated at her sick bed in consideration of her
severe illness; Springer to pay to the Church a hundred reals of
eight for the privilege.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 42}</u></p>

<p>It remains to mention the well-known story of Tasman's supposed
attachment to a daughter of Governor-General Van Diemen, evidenced by
his naming various places, e.g. Cape Maria Van Diemen, Maria Island,
Maria Bay at Tonga. Flinders first suggested this little romance in
his Voyage to Terra Australis, published in 1814. It pleased the
fancy of the French geographer Eyries somewhere about 1820, and has
been repeated and enlarged upon for some eighty years.</p>

<p>It is a pretty story, but unfortunately for the romance it has not
the slightest foundation. In the light of recent investigations
Tasman appears as a twice-married man of middle age, with a grown-up
daughter. But this is not conclusive. Perhaps the next argument
against the story is more cogent: Van Diemen had no daughter. If,
however, anyone, is still unconvinced, we may clinch the argument
with the express statement of Tasman attached to one of the drawings
in his Journal:--"We have named this bay Maria Bay in compliment to
the wife of Governor-General Van Diemen." If anyone after this
requires further proof, let him consult the papers of the Dutch East
India Company, or continue to write sentiment on the ardent young
sailor's unrequited love.</p>

<hr align="center" width="20%">
<p>To conclude. Tasman's discoveries, great as they were from a
geographical point of view, bore no fruit for more than a hundred
years. His tracks were marked on the chartg, but as to the countries
he discovered, his countrymen in the East Indies, whose sole object
was trade, felt no temptation to explore the wild bush of Van
Diemen's Land, or to face the fierce tribes of Massacre Bay, or even
to plant colonies on the barren and inhospitable shores of Western
Australia peopled by naked savages. Only the Englishman Dampier in
1688, and again in 1699, visited the western coast, and was glad to
leave what he described as the most miserable country on earth. Had
Tasman but discovered the way through Torres Strait, it is possible
that New South Wales might have been colonised by the Dutch. It was
reserved, however, for an English navigator, more than a century
after Tasman's voyage, to make the practical discovery of Australia
as a land for European colonisation. When Captain Cook in his first
famous voyage in the Endeavour, on Sunday, 29th April, 1770, cast
anchor in Botany Bay, the Australian Continent was first laid open to
European enterprise; eighteen years later Sydney was founded by
Englishmen. Would that the first planting of these Colonies had been
other than it was, and that the wise warning of Lord Bacon had been
heeded; for, says he--"It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take
the scum of the people and wicked condemned men to be the people with
whom</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 43}</u></p>

<p>you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth the plantation, for
they will ever live like rogues and not fall to work, but be lazy,
and do mischief, and spend victuals and be quickly weary, arid then
certify over to their country to the discredit of the plantation."
All which things were verified in the early history of these
Colonies. But Australia "has burst her birth's invidious bar, and
grasped the skirts of happy chance; breasted the blows of
circumstance, and grappled with her evil star; has made by force her
merit known, and lived to clutch the golden keys." A hundred years
growth has now made Australia well nigh a nation; but as yet it is a
nation in the gristle only. When the petty jealousies of the Colonies
are laid aside, and when the several States.--as we hope may soon be
the case--are united in one great Federation, we may feel a perfect
confidence that, amongst the children of the old English mother, not
the least important will be those dwelling in the island Continent
circumnavigated by Tasman two hundred and fifty years ago, who will
claim the title of Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

<h2><a name="biblio"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES,</h2>

<h4>MAPS OF THE VOYAGES, 1642 AND 1644.</h4>

<p align="center"><i>Manuscript Maps.</i></p>

<p>1. In the collection of Van Keulen of Amsterdam. A large and
handsome map on Japanese paper, showing both voyages. Mr. Leupe
thinks it to be the work of Pilot-Major Visscher. Australia bears the
name of Compagnis Nieu Nederlandt. This map was reproduced in
coloured facsimile in Mr. Swart's edition of the complete journal
published in 1860.</p>

<p>2. In the British Museum. Sloane MSS. 5222, Art. 12. A large
sketch map, roughly executed, showing both voyages. In the centre of
Australia is written "This large Land of New Guinea was first
discovered to joyne to ye South Land by ye Yot Lemmen as by this
Chart Ffran&ccedil;ois Jacobus Vis. Pilot Maior Anno 1643." Mr.
Major, who gives a reduced copy of this chart in his Early Voyages,
thinks it to be a copy of a map by Visscher, and that it was made by
Captain Thomas Bowrey, of Fort St. George, about 1687. Mr. Alfred
Mault, of Hobart, has made a facsimile of the original map, and this
has been photo-lithographed for the Royal Society of Tasmania.</p>

<p>3. In the India Museum, South Kensington. A coloured chart of the
coast of Van Diemen's Land, endorsed in an old hand: "A Draught of
the South Land lately discovered, 1643." Mr. A. Mault found this
chart amongst the Records of the India Office. He contributed to the
Transactions of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of
Science, 1892, a description of this map with coloured facsimile.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p align="center"><i>Early Maps.</i></p>

<p>In 1648, four years after Tasman's second voyage, the building of
the new Stadhuis, or Town Hall, of Amsterdam was begun. The
opportunity was taken to commemorate Tasman's discoveries by showing
them in a great map of the world in two hemispheres, cut in the stone
pavement of the Great Hall (Burgerzaal) of the Stadhuis. This
pavement has long since been boarded over.</p>

<p>Mr. Major says that an outline of the coast visited by Tasman is
given in Turquet's Mappemonde, published in Paris in 1647; also in
the 1650 edition of Janssen's Atlas, and in the 1660 edition of J.
Klencke's Atlas. The discoveries are also shown in Fredk. de Wit's
map, published in 1660; and a representation of the hemispheres is
given in the fine work describing the Stadhuis, and published in
1661. The map in Th&eacute;venot (1663) is from the Stadhuis
pavement, but with names added. Some of the published maps contain
the names Hollandia Nova and Zeelandia Nova.</p>

<h4>MANUSCRIPTS OF THE JOURNAL OF 1642.</h4>

<p>Mr. Leupe describes three. contemporary manuscripts which are
preserved in Holland:--</p>

<p>1. R.A. 1. In the State Archives at the Hague. Consists of 28
double folio leaves, bound in a volume which forms part of a
collection made by Cornelis Sweers. It is badly written and kept in a
slovenly manner, probably by a young officer on board the
Heemskerrk.</p>

<p>2. R.A. 2. In the State Archives. In a large folio volume
containing 196 pages, very neatly written, with a large number of
charts and drawings, some coloured. It bears the autograph signature
of Tasman, and is apparently a fair copy of the official journal kept
on board the Heemskerck. It is probably the manuscript used by
Valentyn in compiling his account. He reproduced most of the maps and
sketches. This manuscript, with the charts and drawings, is to be
reproduced in facsimile in Messrs. Fred. Muller &amp; Co's.
forthcoming edition.</p>

<p>3. H. v. M. In the possession of Mr. Huydecoper van Marsseveen. In
a folio volume, smaller than R.A. 2, contains 112 pages, neatly
written, with three small charts and some sketches. It also is a copy
of an original journal, and is not signed. It has some particulars
not given in R.A. 2. It is from Cornelis Sweers' collection.</p>

<p>The following manuscripts are also known:--</p>

<p>4. Brit. M us. 8946. Plut. C.L. xxii. D. In the British Museum. It
is carelessly written, and contains 38 charts and sketches. Probably
a copy of R.A. 2. This manuscript was bought in London at Mr. Lloyd's
sale, some time before 1776, for half-ag-uinea, and was subsequently
acquired by Sir Joseph Banks. In 1776 Banks employed the Revd.
Charles G. Woide, Chaplain of the Dutch Chapel at St. James's, to
translate it. Woide's translation was used by Captain Burney in his
work. About 1868 the late Mr. J. E. Calder published in the Tasmanian
Times the account of the discovery of Tasmania taken from Burney.</p>

<p>5. Amongst the hydrographical documents belonging to the
publishing firm of Van Keulen of Amsterdam, there was formerly a
manuscript copy of the Journal. It was probably a copy agreeing with
R.A. 2, and, it is said, bore Tasman's signature. Mr. Swart printed
the complete Journal from this copy, 1854-59.</p>

<p>6. Mr. Lauts mentions that a manuscript copy of the Journal was
bought by the bookseller Born, of Amsterdam, in 1835.</p>

<h4>THE DISCOVERY OF TASMANIA.</h4>

<p align="center"><b>FROM TASMAN'S JOURNAL, 1642.</b><b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b></p>

<p>23rd November.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*2]</b>--Good weather, and
the wind S.W., with a fresh gale. In the morning found that our
rudder-head was broken in two in the tiller-mortise; whereupon lay to
under shortened sail, and put a plank on either side. Noon, found our
latitude 42&deg; 50', and longitude 162&deg; 51'. Course held E., and
sailed 25 (100) miles. Here found one degree north-westerly
variation, which here decreases very rapidly. According to our
reckoning had the west side of Nova Guinea to the north of us.</p>

<p>24th November.--Good weather and clear sky. Noon, found latitude
42&deg; 25', and longitude 163&deg; 31'. Course kept E. by N., and
sailed 30 (120) miles. The wind from the S.W., and afterwards S.,
with a gentle top-gallant breeze. Afternoon, about 4 o'clock, saw
land. Had it E. by N. from us 10 (40) miles by our reckoning. It was
very high land. Towards evening saw in the E.S.E. three high
mountains, and in the N.E. also saw two mountains, but not so high as
those to the south. Here had a true pointing compass. In the evening,
in the first glass when the watch<b style="color:#0000FF">[*3]</b>
was set (8 P.M.), proposed to the council of our ship with the under
mates, whether it would not be best to stand off the shore to sea;
and required their opinion, when they thought this to be most
advisable. Whereupon unanimously approved after 3 glasses (9.30 P.M.)
to lie out from the shore and run from it 10 glasses (5 hours), when
we should stand back to the land: all more fully appearing in the
resolution of this date to which we refer. At night, after 3 glasses
(1&frac12; hours), the wind was S.E. Tacked from the shore, and
sounded in 100 fathoms, clean white fine sand with small shells;
afterwards sounded again, and had black coarse sand with small
stones. At night had the wind S.E. with gentle breeze.</p>

<p>25th November.--Morning, nearly calm. Hoisted the white flag and
the flag at the mizzen-top-gallant-mast, whereupon</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 50}</u></p>

<p>the officers of the <i>Zeehaen</i>--with their mates came on board
us, when we called the council and resolved with them, as is to be
seen by the resolution of this day, and is there set out at length,
to which we here refer. Towards noon got the wind S.E., and
afterwards S.S.E. and S. Tacked for the shore. In the evening, about
5 o'clock, came under the shore. Three miles (12) out from the shore
had 60 fathoms, coral bottom</p>

<p>1 mile out (4 miles) had clean fine white sand. Found this coast
stretching S. by E. and N. by W., a smooth [bare] coast, and had
reached latitude 42&deg; 30', and mean longitude 163&deg; 50'. Tacked
again from the shore. The wind blew S.S.E., topgallant breeze. When
you come from the W. and find that you have 4&deg; north-westerly
variation, then you may look out for land, because the variation here
decreases very rapidly. If it happens that you get rough weather from
the westerly quarter, then you may well lie to, and not sail ahead.
Here on the coast you have a compass pointing true. We have also the
mean longitude, which we determined by each working out his reckoning
and taking the mean. Wherefrom we find this land to be in the
longitude of 163&deg; 50'.</p>

<p>This land is the first land in the <i>South Sea</i>
(<i>Zuytzee</i>) that we have met with, and is yet known by no
European nations. So we have given this land the name of ANTHOONY VAN
DIEMENSLANDT, in honor of the Most Honorable the Governor-General,
our High Master, who sent us out to make these discoveries. The
islands lying round about it, as many as are known to us, we have
named after the Honorable Members of the Council of India, and may be
seen on the small chart made thereof.</p>

<p>[Here there are in the manuscript some sketches of land, of which
two are found in VALENTYN, p. 48, No. 1A and No. 5E. The other, No.
5E; I have not found in the manuscript.--JACOB SWART.]</p>

<p>26th November.--Had the wind easterly, gentle breeze, hazy
weather, so that we could not see land. Reckoned we were about 9 (38)
miles from the shore. Towards noon, hoisted the flag at the
main-top-gallant-Mast, whereupon the Zeehaen immediately came up
under our stern, when we hailed her people that Sr. GILSEMANS should
come aboard. Whereupon the said GILSEMANS without delay came on board
us, and we made known to him the matters which are mentioned in the
under-written note, and are to be taken with him to his ship, in
order to show the same to the Skipper, GERRIT JANSZ, and also for
orders to their mates.</p>

<p>"The officers of the fly-ship Zeehaen shall in their daily log
describe this land, which we saw yesterday and are now near,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 51}</u></p>

<p>as in longitude 163&deg; 50'--because by mutual reckoning we find
it thus, and this longitude as settled--and begin to reckon the
longitude afresh from thence. He who before this has longitude
160&deg; or more, shall now make his reckoning from that land. This
is therefore done in order to avoid all mistakes as much as is in any
way possible. The officers of the Zeehaen shall give the same charge
to the mates, and shall also observe it, because we find this to be
fitting; and the charts which are hereafter made by any one shall lay
down that land in the mean longitude as before stated of 163&deg;
50'.</p>

<p>"Given on the <i>Heemshercq</i>, date as above.</p>

<p>"(Undersigned) ABEL JANSZ TASMAN."</p>

<p>Noon, reckoned we were in S. latitude 43&deg; 36', and longitude
163&deg; 2'. Course kept S.S.W., and sailed 18 (72) miles. Had half a
degree north-westerly variation. Got the wind N.E. Set our course
E.S.E.</p>

<p>27th November.--Morning, saw the coast again. Our course was still
E.S.E. Noon, reckoned we were in S. latitude 44&deg; 4', and
longitude 164&deg; 2'. Course held S.E. by E., and sailed 13 (52)
miles. It was drizzling, misty, hazy, and rainy weather the wind N.E.
and N.N.E., with gentle breeze. At night, after 7 glasses in the
first watch (11.30 P.M.), lay to under shortened sail. We dared not
sail on, by reason that it was so dark.</p>

<p>28th November.--Morning, still cloudy, misty, rainy weather. Made
sail again. Set our course E., and afterwards N.E. by N. Saw land
N.E. and N.N.E. from us, and stood straight for it. The coast here
stretches S.E. by E. and N.W. by W. This land runs away here to the
east so far as I can observe. Noon, by reckoning in latitude 44&deg;
12', and longitude 165&deg; 2'; and course held E. by S., and sailed
11 (44) miles. The wind from the N.W., with gentle breeze. In the
evening came under the shore. There are under the shore some small
islands, one of which looks like a lion. This lies about 3 (12) miles
out to sea from the mainland. Evening got the wind E. At night lay to
under shortened sail.</p>

<p>29th November.--Morning, were still near the rock which looks like
a lion's head.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> Had the wind
westerly, with topgallant breeze. Sailed along the coast, which here
stretches east and west. Towards noon passed two rocks, the most
westerly looking like <i>Pedra Branca</i>, which lies on the coast of
<i>China</i>; the most easterly, looking like a high rugged tower,
lies about 4 (16) miles out from the mainland. Ran through between
these rocks and the land. Noon, reckoned we were in latitude 43&deg;
53', longitude 166&deg; 3'. Course held E.N.E., and sailed</p>

<blockquote>[*1) The <i>Mewstone</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 52}</u></p>

<p>12 (48) miles. Still sailed along the shore. In the evening, about
5 o'clock, came before a bay.<b style="color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> It
seemed that we would likely find a good anchorage there. Wherefore
resolved with our ships' council to run into it, as appears by the
said resolution. Were almost in the bay when there presently arose
such a violent wind that we were obliged to take in our sails and run
back to sea under shortened sail, because it was impossible with such
a wind to come to an anchor. In the evening resolved to stand out to
sea for the night under shortened sail that we might not fall on a
lee shore in such a storm. All which is to be seen more at large in
the above-mentioned resolution, whereto (to avoid prolixity) we here
refer.</p>

<p>Ultimo November.--Morning, at dawn, tacked to the shore. Had been
driven off from the shore so far by wind and current that we could
scarcely see land. Did our best to approach it again. Noon, had land
N.W. from us; tacked to the west, the wind northerly, but not serving
us to fetch the land. Noon, found latitude 43&deg; 41', longitude
168&deg; 3'. Course held E. by N., and sailed 20 (80) miles, with
stormy and unsettled weather. Here the compass showed true. A little
after noon tacked to the west, with hard unsteady breeze. Tacked to
the north under shortened sail.</p>

<p>Primo December.--Morning, weather somewhat more moderate. Set our
topsails; the wind W.S.W., with top-gallant breeze. Steered our
course for the shore. Noon, found latitude 43&deg; 10', and longitude
167&deg; 55'. Course held N.N.W., and sailed 8 (32) miles, and was
almost calm. At noon, hoisted the white flag, whereupon our friends
of the <i>Zeehaen</i> came on board, when we resolved together that
it would be best and most expedient, if wind and weather but
permitted, to get on land, the sooner the better, so as to obtain a
nearer knowledge of its situation, and also to see what refreshments
were to be had, as the resolution of to day shows more at large.
Afterwards got a little breeze from the eastward. Ran towards the
shore to examine whether some good anchorage can be got hereabouts.
About an hour after sunset let go the anchor in a good harbour, in 22
fathoms, between white and grey fine sand, good holding ground; for
which we must show thankful hearts to Almighty God.</p>

degree from those in TASMAN'S Journal. Also the two little ships of

<blockquote>[*1) <i>Storm bay</i>, or rather, <i>Adventure
Bay</i>.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 53}</u></p>

<p>2nd December.--Early in the morning sent the Pilot-Major, FRANCOY
JACOBSZ, with our long-boat (<i>chaloup</i>), with 4 musketeers and 6
rowers, every one provided with a pike and sidearms, together with
the launch (<i>praeutien, sloep</i>) of the Zeehaen, and one of their
second mates and 6 musketeers, to an inlet (<i>innijck</i>), which
was situated fully a long mile (Le., over 4 miles) north-west of us,
in order to see what useful things--such as fresh water,
refreshments, timber, and other things--might be obtainable there.
About 3 hours before evening our boats returned, bringing various
samples of vegetables, which they had seen growing in abundance, some
not unlike certain herbs which grow at the <i>Cabo de Bona
Esperance</i> (<i>Cape of Good Hope</i>) and are fit for use as pot
herbs. Others were long and saltish, which have no ill-likeness to
sea-parsley. The Pilot-Major and the second-mate of the
<i>Zeehaen</i> reported what follows, namely:--</p>

<p>That they had rowed above a mile (4 miles) to the said point,
where they had found high but level land with herbs (not planted, but
springing from God and nature), fruitful timber in plenty, and a
running watering place, and many open valleys; which water was good
indeed, but very troublesome to draw, and running so slowly that it
could only be taken out with a bowl.</p>

<p>That they had heard some sound of people; also a playing nearly
like a trumpet or small gom [gong], winch was not far from them, but
they had not got to bee anyone.</p>

<p>That they had seen two trees about 2 to 2&frac12; fathoms thick,
60 to 65 feet high below the branches, which trees had been hacked
into with flints, and the bark peeled off in the form of steps (in
order to climb up thereby and take birds' nests), each being full 5
feet from the other. So that they presumed that there were very tall
men here, or that they must know how to climb the said trees by some
device, In one tree these cut steps seemed so fresh and green as if
not four days had passed since they had been hewn.</p>

<p>That they had observed in the earth footprints or scratchings of
some beasts, not ill-resembling the claws of a tiger. They also
brought on board some dung of four-footed beasts (as they presumed
and could observe), besides a little gum, fine in appearance, which
drops out of the trees, and has a resemblance to gumlac (<i>gomma
lacca</i>). That about the east point of this bay, having sounded at
high-water, they had fbund 13 to 14 feet; the ebb and flood there
about 3 feet.</p>

<p>That in the entrance of the said point they had seen a multitude
of gulls, wild ducks, and geese, but none landward: though they had
indeed heard the noise of them; and had observed no fish, but divers
mussels sticking in sundry places on bushes.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 54}</u></p>

<p>That the country is generally occupied with trees, which stand so
thinly scattered that you may pass through everywhere and see to a
far distance; so that you could always get sight of people or wild
beasts in the country, as it is unencumbered by thick wood or
underwood; which should give great facility for the exploring of the
country.</p>

<p>That in various places in the interior they had seen many trees
which had been deeply burnt into above their roots. The earth was
here and there beaten down and burnt as hard as stones by the
lighting of fires on it.</p>

<p>A little before our bouts (which were coming on board) got within
sight, we saw at times a thick smoke rising on the land, which lay
about W. by N. from us. We therefore presumed that our people were
doing it for a signal, because they were delayed so long in
returning; for they had their orders to come back to us with speed,
partly in order to inform us of their discoveries, or otherwise, if
they saw there was nothing useful there, that they might go to
examine other places, so that no time should be spent uselessly. Our
people having come on board we asked them whether they had been
thereabouts and had lighted fires, whereupon they replied that they
had not, but that at divers times and places in the woods they also
had seen smokes; so that without doubt there must be men in this
place, and these of an uncommon stature.</p>

<p>To-day, had much variable wind from the eastward, but the most of
the day a stiff steady gale from the S.E.</p>

<p>3rd December.--To-day we went with the Merchant GILSEMANS and our
boats, as yesterday, with musketeers, the rowers being provided with
pikes and side arms, to the S.E. side of this bay. Where we found
water, the land so low that the fresh water was made brackish and
salt through the breaking of the sea, and the ground was too rocky to
sink wells. Therefore returned on board, summoned the council of our
two ships, with whom we resolved and found to be good, as is shown by
the resolution of this date, where it is to be seen at length and is
set forth; whereto for brevity's sake we here refer. Afternoon, we
went with the said boats, together with the Pilot-Major FRANCOYS
JACOBSZ, the Skipper GERRIT JANSZ, ISACK GILSEMANS, Merchant of the
<i>Zeehaen</i>, the Junior Merchant ABRAHAM COOMANS; and our Chief
Carpenter PIETER JACOBSZ, to the S.E. corner of this bay, having with
us a pole with the Company's mark cut therein, and the Prince's flag,
in order to set the same up there, so that it may be evident to
posterity that we have been here and taken the said land for a
possession and property. Having rowed with our boats about half way,
it began to blow hard and the sea to rise so-high that the launch of
the <i>Zeehaen</i>, in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 55}</u></p>

<p>which were the Pilot-Major and Sr. GILSEMANS, was obliged to
return on board. We went on with our long-boat (<i>chaloup</i>),
coming close under the shore into a little hay which lay W.S.W. from
the ships. The surf broke at such a rate that the land could not be
approached without danger of the boat being dashed in pieces. We
ordered the said carpenter to swim ashore by himself with the pole
and Prince's flag, and remained with the long-boat lying to the wind.
We made him set up the said pole with the flag at the top in the
earth before a decaying tree, the lowest one of a group of four
noticeable high trees standing in the form of a crescent about the
middle of this bay. This tree is burnt just above the foot, and is
indeed the tallest of the other three,<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[*1]</b> though it appears to be not so high, since
it stands on the declivity of the cluster. It has at the top above
its crown two high dry branches sticking out, so uniformly set about
with dry twigs and branchlets that it looks like the great horns of a
stag. Moreover, on the undermost side there stands a very green and
round well-crowned branch, the shoots of which, by their even
proportion, made the said tree very elegant and like the top of a
larding pin. After the head carpenter had accomplished the matter
above rehearsed, in view of me, ABEL JANSZ TASMAN, the Skipper GERRIT
JANSZ, and the Junior Merchant ABRAHAM COOMANS, we rowed the boat as
near to the shore as we dared venture, and the said carpenter swam
back again to the longboat through the surf; when, after
accomplishing this matter, we rowed back, again on board, leaving the
above-mentioned as a memorial to posterity and to the inhabitants of
this country, who did not show themselves, although we suspected that
some of them were not far from there, and kept watchful eyes on our
proceedings.</p>

<p>We did not look for herbs, for on account of the roughness of the
sea no one could reach the shore save by swimming, so that it was
impossible to bring anything to the long-boat. All day the wind was
mostly northerly. In the evening took observation of the sun, and
found 3&deg; N.E. variation. With sunset got a strong north wind,
which rapidly increased to so violent a storm from the N.N.W. that we
were constrained to strike both yards and to let go our bower
anchor.</p>

<p>4th December.--With the dawning of day the storm abated. The
weather moderate, and the wind being off shore W. by N. Hove in the
bower anchor again. The said anchor being hove up and got above
water, saw that both flukes were so far gone that we got home nothing
but the bare shaft. Weighed the other anchor also, and got under
sail, in</p>

<blockquote>[*1) <i>Sic</i> in original.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 56}</u></p>

<p>order to sail to the north between the most northerly islands, and
to seek a more convenient watering-place. We have lain at anchor here
in S. lat. 43&deg;, long. 167&frac12;&ordm;. Before noon the wind
westerly. At noon found lat. 42&deg; 40', long. 168&deg;. Course
held. N.E., and sailed 8 (32) miles. Afternoon, the wind N.W. The
whole day very variable winds. In the evening again had W.N.W. with
strong wind, W. by N., and W.N.W. Tacked about to the northward. In
the evening saw a round mountain N.N.W. of us about 8 (32) miles.
Course close hauled by the wind northwards. In sailing out of this
bay, and also the whole day through, saw away along the coast much
smoke rising from fires. We should here describe the trend of the
coast and of the neighbouring islands, but excuse the same in order
to be brief, referring to the small chart that has been made of it,
and is subjoined herewith.</p>

<p>[Here is probably meant the chart of which mention is made in the
conclusion of this Journal for 1st December.--JACOB SWART.]</p>

<p>5th December.--In the morning the wind N.W. by W. Still made our
course as before. The high round mountain which we had seen the day
'before bore due W. of us 6 (24) miles, from whence the land falls
off to the N.W. so that we could no longer hold could land on board,
because the wind was almost ahead. Wherefore we summoned the Council
and second mates, who proposed, and it was therewith resolved---the
officers of the <i>Zeehaen</i> having been spoken--to set our course
due east, according to the resolution of the 11th ulto., and to run
on this course until we reach the longitude of 195&ordm;, or that of
the <i>Salomonis Islands</i>, as may be more fully seen by the
resolution of this date. Noon, reckoned lat. 41&deg; 34', long.
169&deg;. Course held N.E. by and sailed 20 (80) miles. Set our
course due east, in order to make further discoveries, and also in
order not to fall into the variable winds between the trades and
counter-trades. The wind N.W., fresh gale. At night the wind W.,
strong fresh gale and good clear weather.</p>
