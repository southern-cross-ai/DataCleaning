<p>The work of preparing the following account of the discovery,
by Tasman, of the sixth state of the Australian Commonwealth has
been undertaken not only with a view to reviving history known to
but few of the present generation, and assist in justifying the
Society's title to bear the name it does, but also to remind our
people of a man whose name must ever hold a high place on the
scroll of honour to those men who braved every danger on sea and
land to give to us the great territories we now possess.</p>

<p>Abel Janszoon Tasman was unquestionably one of the greatest,
if not the greatest, of the navigators between Magellan, (who, in
the early years of the 16th century first crossed the Pacific
Ocean), and Cook, who in the latter years of the eighteenth
century practically opened Oceania and Australia to Europe.</p>

<p>Little is known of Tasman's personal history, except that he
was born about the year 1602 at Hoorn on the Zuyder Zee, a
seaport which produced many another hardy navigator.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 114}</u></p>

<p>Tasman has made familiar in our seas the name of one of his
fellow townsmen, viz., Corneliszoon Schouten, who in 1616 doubled
the Cape, afterwards called the Horn in honour of the birthplace
of its discoverer. 

<p>That Tasman's merit has not received due recognition and that
his fame has not been as wide as his achievements deserved, is
largely the fault of his own countrymen. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the persistent policy of the Dutch was to
conceal the discoveries of their navigators, and suppress their
charts for fear other nations should reap advantage from the
knowledge, and rival them in the eastern seas. In later times,
when this motive had lost its force, Tasman's countrymen were
strangely indifferent to the honour which their great sailor had
won for his native land. Of his second voyage (1644), in which he
explored the northern coast of Australia, and laid down with
painstaking accuracy the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, we
have to this day only meagre hints and the record contained in a
sketch map of his more famous voyage to the Great South Land, in
1642, during which he discovered Tasmania and New Zealand, and
made a great step towards solving the vexed problem of the
fancied Terra Australis. The journal remained unpublished for
more than two centuries. A short abstract of the voyage was
published in Holland late in the seventeenth century, and was
shortly afterwards translated into English and French. Valentyn,
in his work on the Dutch East Indies, published in 1726, gave a
more extended account, illustrated by copies of Tasman's maps and
sketches. But the journal itself remained practically unknown
until a copy of it, with the original sketches and charts, was
discovered in London in 1776 and purchased for half a guinea.
This MS. afterwards came into the possession of Sir Joseph Banks,
and he employed the Rev. C. G. Waide, a Dutch clergyman, living
in London, to make a translation of it The MS. of this is now in
the British Museum. Some years ago a verbatim copy of the part
referring to Tasmania was made by Mr. Bonwick for the Government
of that state.</p>

<p>Tasman's expedition was probably the first attempt made by the
Dutch to explore systematically the Great South Land. In the
early years of the seventeenth century the western coast of
Australia had been several times sighted by Dutch captains; ships
bound for the Dutch settlements at Batavia, had been driven to
the southward by storms, and the resulting discoveries had,
therefore, been to a</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page:115}</u></p>

<p>large extent involuntary, or accidental. In the year 1642,
however, the Governor-General, Anthony Van Diemen, and the
Council of Netherlands, India, determined to despatch from
Batavia a properly equipped expedition, having for its sole
object the discovery of the Great South Continent. 

<p>The command of the expedition was entrusted to Tasman, then
forty years old, his ship being the <i>Heemskirk</i> (175 tons)
with the little fly-boat <i>Zeehan</i> (50 tons) as tender. He
sailed from Batavia on August 14 and arrived at Mauritius on
September 5. Leaving the latter port, a month later, a southern
course was followed, and on November 24th land was sighted
bearing east by north, distant ten Dutch miles (40 miles
English). Of the discovery Tasman wrote: "This is the furthest
land in the south sea we met with, and as it has not yet been
known to any European we call it Anthony Van Diemen's Land, in
honour of the Governor-General, our master. The islands round
about, as many as were known to us, we named in honour of the
Council of India." They skirted the newly discovered land and on
December 1 anchored in a bay on the east coast. On December 3
they sailed north to St. Patrick's Head, from whence an east
course was shaped. On the eighth day land was seen and Tasman
named it Staten Land, thinking it might be part of the southern
continent and joined to Staten Land, east of Tierra del Fuego.
When this supposition was shown, in 1643, to be an error through
Brouwer's voyage round Cape Horn, the name was changed to that of
New Zealand.</p>

<p>After a fatal encounter with the Maoris, Tasman' sailed along
the west coast to Cape Maria Van Diemen. Taking from thence a
north-east course he discovered Amsterdam and other islands, and
after sailing north-west and then skirting the north coast of New
Guinea he returned to Batavia.</p>

<p>In 1644 Tasman sailed a second time from Batavia and explored
the south coast of New Guinea, the gulf of Carpentaria and the
north and north-West coasts of Australia. Thus, in the two
voyages, though he left the question of the existence of a
southern continent unsolved, he had made the first complete
circumnavigation of Australia and New Guinea.</p>

<p>It is generally stated that the first land sighted by Tasman
was near Point Hibbs, and his little chart of Van Diemen's land
appears to favour this opinion, but an examination of his journal
leads to a different conclusion.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 116}</u></p>

<p>From the entries referred to it is evident that his position on
November 24, when he first saw the land, is not laid down on the
chart. The latitude entered for noon of that day is 42 deg. 25
minutes. As the weather was clear this was probably the observed
latitude, and making allowance for the usual error we may place
it some miles more to the north. From noon he sailed four hours
E. by N. before he sighted land bearing E. by N. 40 English miles
distant. Some three hours later this course would have brought
him to a latitude a little to the northward of Cape Sorell (42
deg 12 min). The position would agree with his description of the
land he saw, viz. "very high." Towards evening he saw three high
mountains, to the E.S.E. and to the N.E. He also saw two
mountains N.E., but not so high as those to the southward.
Flinders in his circumnavigation of the island identified the two
mountains to the N.E. as those named by him Heemskirk and Zeehan
after Tasman's ships. 

<p>When the shades of evening fell over the strange shore they
had just discovered, it was deemed prudent to run out to sea
during the night. When morning broke the breeze had died away and
it was noon before they had enough wind to run in again. By five
in the evening they were within 12 miles of the land and they
kept on their course until within 4 miles of what was without
doubt Point Hibbs. Next day the ships sailed south-east in thick
foggy weather, in which only glimpses of the coast were obtained.
Tasman took some of the high head-lands and mountains about Point
Davey for islands, calling them De Witt and Sweers Islands. Then
he rounded the South West Cape, and named Maatsuyker Islands,
passing close to a small island (about 12 miles from the
mainland) which in appearance resembled a lion and which was
afterwards identified by Flinders as the rock named by Furneaux,
The Mewstone. Thence he passed between the mainland and a rock
which he named Pedra Branca (White Rock) from its resemblance to
Pedra Branca off the coast of China, sailed past the entrance to
D'Entrecasteaux Channel, and on November 29 rounded the Friars,
(which he named Boreels Isles); bearing up for a large bay,
intending to anchor there. He had almost reached his intended
anchorage when a heavy storm arose and he was driven out so far
to sea that next morning he could hardly discern the land. It was
from this incident that Storm Bay got its name. (The anchorage
Tasman attempted to reach is that at which Furneaux anchored in
1773 and which he named Adventure Bay.) When the wind moderated
he</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 117}</u></p>

<p>continued his easterly course, and rounding Tasman's Island (The
Pillar) he turned northward along the east coast of Tasman and
Forestier's peninsulas until on Dec. 1, an hour after sunset, he
anchored in a good port, in 22 fathoms, the bottom fine
light-grey sand. "Wherefore," says Tasman piously, "we ought to
lift up thankful hearts to Almighty God." The position of this
anchorage, as shown on Tasman's chart, is north-west of the rocky
islet now called Green Island; just north of the basaltic cliffs
of Cape Frederick Henry. 

<p>On December 2, early in the morning, the boat was sent to
explore a bay some four miles to the north-west (Blackman's Bay).
The boat returned in the evening. The crew reported that they had
rowed some miles after passing through the entrance to the bay
(now known as the Narrows). They had heard human voices but had
not seen anyone.</p>

<p>The next day, December 3, the boats went to the south-east
corner of the bay in which the ships were anchored, in order to
get fresh water, but, though they found a lagoon, the shore was
so low that the waves had broken through and the water was too
brackish to use. In the afternoon when an attempt was made to
land, the sea ran so high that one boat was obliged to return to
the ship. The other, a larger one, under the command of Tasman,
made for a little bay W.S.W. of the ships but the sea was too
rough to allow of landing. The carpenter, Peter Jacobsen,
volunteered to swim ashore with a pole on which was the Prince's
flag, which he planted on the shore of the bay. Thus Tasman took
possession of the island for the Dutch.</p>

<p>On December 4 they weighed anchor and stood to the northward
passing Maria and Schouten Islands, the latter being so named, by
Tasman, after his fellow-townsman of the Port of Hoorn. On the
following morning he sailed from opposite a high round hill (St.
Patrick's Head) and stood away eastward to make further
discoveries.</p>

<p>Of the localities associated with the discovery of Tasmania,
the chief interest attaches to Frederick Henry Bay, and its
neighbourhood. The name has been dislocated from its rightful
position on the map, and has been transferred to another part of
the coast, where it is now fixed by long usage. Tasman never saw
what is now known as Frederick Henry Bay. The bay to which he
gave the name of the Stadtholder of Holland was in the immediate
vicinity of his anchorage on the north-east</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 118}</u></p>

<p>coast of Forestier's Peninsula. Its exact locality the records of
the voyage leave a little doubtful. The journal contains no names
of places, but the account of the planting of the Flag would lead
to the inference that the Prince's name was given to the bay in
which the ships lay at anchor, and which is now known as Marion
Bay. The charts, however, lead rather to the conclusion that it
is the inner port, or arm of the sea, now Blackman's Bay. The
copy of the map in Burney leaves the point doubtful, the name
being written on the land between the two ports. But in the chart
as reproduced by Vallentyn, and stated to have been copied by him
from the original journal, the name is distinctly written in
Blackman's Bay. 

<p>For more than a century after Tasman anchored off Green Island
no navigator ventured to follow him into the stormy seas that
wash the dark cliffs of the Great South Land.</p>

<p>The first of the moderns who sighted the coast of Van Diemen's
Land was the French Captain Marion du Fresne in 1772. Marion made
the west coast a little to the south of Tasman's land-fall, and,
following almost the same course as the earlier navigator, his
ships, the <i>Mascarin</i> and <i>Marquis de Castries</i> ,
anchored on March 5, 1772, at a spot somewhat to the north west
of the <i>Hemskerk's</i> anchorage in 1642. Marion took this to
be the Frederick Henry Bay of Tasman, but, as has already been
shown, this was almost certainly an error, and since the visit of
the <i>Mascarin</i> the outer bay, as distinguished from the
inner, has borne on the charts the more appropriate designation
of Marion Bay. The description in the narrative of the voyage is
not sufficiently exact to enable one to determine the precise
spot where the French landed, but it appears to have been on the
Two-mile Beach (North Bay of our present maps). On this beach it
was that the aborigines of Tasmania first came into contact with
Europeans. The meeting was an ill-omened one; the blacks resisted
the landing, and attacked Marion's party with stones and spears.
The French, in retaliation, fired upon them, killing one man and
wounding others. The ships lay in the bay for six days, during
which time the French explored the country for a considerable
distance, searching for fresh water, and timber for spars, but
they saw nothing more of the natives after the first fatal
encounter. Being unable to find either good water or timber
suitable for his needs, Marion sailed on March 10 for New
Zealand, where he met his death in a treacherous attack on his
people by the Maoris.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 119}</u></p>

<p>The next navigator who visited Tasmania was Captain Tobias
Furneaux--Cook's second in command on his second voyage of
discovery. It is to Furneaux's blunders that the confusion
respecting Frederick Henry Bay is due. The two ships (the
<i>Resolution</i> , 462 tons, and the <i>Adventure</i> , 336
tons) were separated by a storm in latitude 50 degrees south,
between the Cape and Australia. Cook, in the <i>Resolution</i>
kept on his course for New Zealand; Furneaux in the
<i>Adventure</i> , being short of water, bore up for the land
laid down by Tasman as Van Diemen's Land. On March 9, 1773,
Furneaux sighted the land at a point which he took to be Tasman's
South Cape. The point was, in fact, South West Cape, and from
this initial error the whole course of subsequent blunders
arose.</p>

<p>From South West Cape he sailed eastward, intending to make
Tasman's anchorage in Frederick Henry Bay. Reaching the South
Cape, he mistook it for the Boreel Islands, south of Bruny, and
mistook the entrance of D'Entrecasteaux Channel for Tasman's
Storm Bay. The south point of Bruny he mistook for Tasman's
Island (the Pillar) and called it Tasman's Head. Rounding Bruny
Island he stood north, under the impression that he was sailing
along the east coast of Van Diemen's Land, and in the evening
anchored in a bay of which he says:--</p>

<p>"We at first took this bay to be that which Tasman called
Frederick Henry Bay, but afterwards found that it is laid down
five leagues to the northward of this." Furneaux named his
anchorage Adventure Bay, the point to the north be called Cape
Frederick Henry--believing that Tasman's Frederick Henry Bay lay
to the north of this cape--and the opposite shore, of Tasman's
Peninsula, he laid down on his chart as Maria's Isles. After five
days' stay in Adventure Bay, he sailed out and rounded the
Pillar, under the impression that he was rounding the south point
of Maria Island. Then he proceeded north as far as the Furneaux
Group, and bore away for New Zealand to rejoin Cook.</p>

<p>Cook, on his third voyage, cast anchor in Adventure Bay on
January 24, 1777, without detecting Furneaux's mistake or
correcting his charts.</p>

<p>In 1789, Captain J. H. Cox, in the brig <i>Mercury</i>
anchored in the strait between Maria Island and the mainland,
but, misled by the charts of Furneaux and Cook, never suspected
that he was within a few miles of Tasman's Frederick Henry
Bay.</p>

<p>In April, 1792, Admiral D'Entrecasteaux with the ships
<i>Recherche</i> and <i>Esperance</i> , sighted the Mewstone, and
bore</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 120}</u></p>

<p>up for the mainland, intending to make Cook's anchorage in
Adventure Bay. Through an error of his pilot, instead of rounding
Bruny Island, he stood to the west of it, and found he was not in
Adventure Bay, but in the entrance of the Channel, which he (like
Cook) believed to be the Storm Bay of Tasman. D'Entrecasteaux
explored the channel which bears his name, ascended the river,
which he named <i>Riviere du Nord</i> , and explored the wide bay
to the north-east, which he named <i>Baie du Nord</i> . This bay
he thought communicated with Tasman's Frederick Henry Bay on the
east coast, and under this impression the land which Cook had
erroneously laid down as Maria Island he named <i>Ile d'Abel
Tasman</i> . 

<p>In 1794, Captain John Hayes in the ships <i>Duke of
Clarence</i> and <i>Duchess</i> , visited Storm Bay--although the
name does not appear on his charts. He evidently had only Cook's
chart since he placed Adventure Bay, Tasman's Head and Maria's
Isles as they are laid down by Cook. Captain Hayes renamed all
the other localities in Storm Bay, and it is to him we owe the
name of the River Derwent. The Baie du Nord of D'Entrecasteaux he
called Henshaw's Bay.</p>

<p>In December, 1798, Flinders and Bass, in their first
circumnavigation of the island in the <i>Norfolk</i> , sailed up
Storm Bay, explored and surveyed the Baie du Nord. Flinders says
he was at the time quite ignorant that this bay had ever been
entered before, and, misled by the errors of Furneaux and Cook,
he laid it down on his first sketch chart as Frederick Henry
Bay.</p>

<p>In January, 1802, the French discovery expedition under
Admiral Baudin, in the ships <i>Geographe</i> and
<i>Naturaliste</i> , arrived in D'Entrecasteaux Channel. During a
stay of some weeks they completed the surveys of Admiral
D'Entrecasteaux and explored and surveyed the Baie Nord. They
then sailed for the east coast and anchored in the passage
between Maria Island and the mainland. From this point Freycinet
(Baudin's lieutenant) made the first thorough examination of
Tasman's Frederik Hendrik Bay. He explored it as far as East Bay
Neck, and was thus enabled to correct the mistakes of former
navigators. He found that D'Entrecasteaux had been mistaken in
supposing that there was a channel between Frederick Henry Bay,
and the Baie du Nord, and that the supposed Ile d'Abel Tasman was
a double peninsula, to which he gave the names of Forrestier's
and Tasman's Peninsula. He also proved that Flinders had been in
error in applying the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 121}</u></p>

<p>name Frederick Henry to the Baie du Nord. The charts of Baudin's
expedition, constructed by Faure, were the first to show the
coast accurately; in them, for the first time, the outer port was
laid down as Baie Marion, and the inner one as Baie Frederik
Hendrik. Many years later (after his release from his long
captivity in Mauritius) Flinders came to write his <i>Voyage to
Terra Australis</i> [and] he had the opportunity to compare his
surveys (of 15 years before) with the French charts and correct
his errors. In his Atlas, therefore, the Bale du Nord is
correctly named North Bay, and the name of Frederick Henry Bay is
restored to its proper place on the east coast; though he applies
it to the outer port and not the inner, which bears the name in
Tasman's map. 

<p>The original error of Furneaux (perpetuated as it was by Cook
and Flinders' first chart) had obtained too firm a hold to be
displaced.</p>

<p>After the publication of Flinders' Atlas some of the early
map-makers endeavoured to restore the names to their proper
localities. Thus in a chart compiled by G. W. Evans
(Surveyor-General), and published in London in 1821, and also in
a chart published in London by Cross in 1826, North Bay is
correctly placed and the name Frederick Henry is in the first map
applied to the outer bay, and in the second more correctly to the
inner one. In Assistant-Surveyor Scott's map, published in Hobart
by Ross in 1830, the name Frederick Henry appears in Storm Bay,
but in Arrowsmith's map published in London in 1842, the
alternative names are given, viz., Frederick Henry Bay, or North
Bay; while the name Frederick Henry also appears, correctly, in
the inner bay.</p>

<p>There still remains another memorable voyage of discovery to
record, undertaken by Bass and Flinders conjointly in the year
1798. The object of this expedition was to demonstrate the
existence of the probable strait and the consequent insularity of
Van Diemen's Land. The way it was proposed to accomplish this
double object was to sail through the channel and circumnavigate
the island. Bent on this adventure, Bass and Flinders left Sydney
Cove on the 7th October 1798, in the <i>Norfolk</i> , 25 tons.
Their cruise in the channel disclosed a large number of islands.
The circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land commenced at the
northern point, known as Cape Portland; nothing specially
remarkable occurred till a point was reached which they named Low
Head, immediately after which the <i>Norfolk</i> entered an arm
of the sea more than a mile in</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page: 122}</u></p>

<p>width. This appeared to be a discovery of sufficient importance
to devote sixteen days to its exploration. It proved to be the
embouchure of what is now known as the River Tamar, on which
Launceston, the second town of the island, is built. After a
short sail to the westward they found themselves rounding the
north-west cape and could perceive the shore trending to the
south. The problem was already virtually solved. "Mr Bass and
myself," says Flinders, "hailed it with joy and mutual
congratulations, as announcing the completion of our long-wished
for discovery of a passage into the Southern Indian Ocean." This
fortunate issue of their hours marked an epoch both in the
history of discovery and the progress of international commerce.
By January 6 they had brought their work to an end. The heroic
navigators (as they were then and are still termed) returned to
Sydney bringing the welcome intelligence that there was no longer
doubt as to the insularity of Tasmania. The merit of the latter
discovery is almost equally due to both navigators, but with a
generosity which reflects credit, (and is as noble as it is rare)
Flinders prevailed on Governor Hunter to name it Bass' Straits. 

<p>Previous navigators had treated the territory as portion of
the Great South Land. It was left to Flinders and Bass to prove
otherwise.</p>

We can make our lives sublime
