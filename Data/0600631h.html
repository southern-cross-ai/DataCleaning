Hudson River (New York State) in 1609. The <i>Halve Maen</i> was
a Dutch "yacht" of the same type and size as the <i>Duyfken</i>,
carried the same number of men, and was afloat at the same
period. A full-sized replica of this vessel was presented by the
Dutch people to New York on the occasion of the 300th anniversary
of Hudson's discovery. There is no authentic picture of the

<h3><a name="ch00">PREFACE.</a></h3>

<p>When the chart of the <i>Duyfken</i> first came to my notice,
I recognised that I had before me a fascinating document--a copy
of the earliest record of the history of Australia as transcribed
by the hand of man. It so interested me that I wrote an article
upon it, which was published in two instalments in the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> on the 2nd and 9th of December, 1933.</p>

<p>My interest continued. I had made a visit to Java in 1929,
returning convinced of the importance to Australia of these
near-neighbour countries, of which we know so little, and with a
profound respect for the Dutch as colonisers. It was therefore a
congenial task I set myself when I resolved to find out what was
known about the Dutch navigator who in 1606 sailed from Bantam
to explore the southern coast of New Guinea, and extended his
voyage to make the first discovery of Australian shores.</p>

<p>Who was Willem Jansz, or Janszoon (in plain English, William
Johnson), the captain of the <i>Duyfken</i>? Who was Jan
Lodewycksz van Roossengin, the Sub-cargo? What were the
circumstances under which the expedition was made? What did they
have to say about the strange new country they had found?</p>

<p>I searched in vain, in Dutch and Australian histories, for a
connected narrative of the voyage. The log of the <i>Duyfken</i>
had been lost. Like many another document of historical
importance, its value was unrecognised by those who handled it in
those busy and exciting early years of the Dutch East India
Company. We do not have to go far from home to find examples of
the same indifference and neglect.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 4}</u></p>

<p>If the log, or copies of it, were sent to the headquarters of
the company at Amsterdam, they may have been sent to the
company's cartographers for the preparation of charts, and not
returned; or some iconoclastic clerk may have decided that they
took up too much room on the shelves of the record room, and sent
them to the incinerator or the pulping-mill, or even to the
butcher's; or through careless storage, they may have merely
decayed. I do not exclude the possibility that they were stolen,
but whatever happened, they disappeared.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that they were sought for in the Indies
in 1616, without success; and it is certain that some particulars
of the voyage, and a copy of the chart, were available to Jan
Carstensz, who followed the <i>Duyfken's</i> track when he went
to the Gulf of Carpentaria in command of the <i>Pera</i> and
<i>Arnhem</i> in 1623.</p>

<p>Willem Jansz, the captain of the <i>Duyfken</i>, was then an
Admiral, and a member of the Council of the Indies, but he was
with his fleet in the Philippines when arrangements for the
Carstensz voyage were made, and had scarcely returned to Batavia
before Carstensz left Amboina. For that reason, Carstensz would
have proceeded without the knowledge which Jansz could have given
him, which accounts for the paucity of information about the
<i>Duyfken</i> voyage in the <i>Pera's</i> log and chart.</p>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i> chart had a better fate than the log or
journal. It was still in existence in Amsterdam when Hessel
Gerritsz made his Map of the Pacific in 1622, and placed the
<i>Duyfken</i> geography upon it, thus providing us with the
first map that contains any part of Australia; it was still in
existence about 1670, when a copy was made, which eventually went
to the Imperial Library in Vienna and remained buried there for
200 years.</p>

<p>With this copy of the chart as a beginning, I have made
searches through the Dutch material available in Australia, the
result of which is embodied in the following pages. Piecing
together like a mosaic the items so gathered, it is here shown
for the first time in English that Willem Jansz was in all
probability the Willem Jansz who first went to the Indies in
1598, and, of a certainty, was the Willem Jansz who made a second
discovery of the Australian coast in 1618. (Incidentally, on
this voyage,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 5}</u></p>

<p>as Supercargo of the <i>Mauritius</i>, he had with him Anthony
van Diemen, travelling as a naval cadet under the assumed name of
Teunis Meeuwsen, who became Governor-General of the Dutch East
Indies in 1636, and inspired Tasman's voyages in 1642 and
1644.)</p>

<p>Willem Jansz became an Admiral in 1620, and in the following
year led a combined Dutch and English fleet against the Spaniards
at Manilla.</p>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i> was possibly the <i>Duyfken</i> of the
Dutch first fleet (1595); certainly went to the Indies with Willem
Schouten as captain in 1601, and with Willem Jansz as captain in
1603. It was a vessel of 30 lasten or 60 (English) tons, and
would have measured about 63 feet in length, 17 or 18 feet in
width, with a draught of 7 feet, and carrying 20 men.</p>

<p>The story of the early Dutch discoveries on the coasts of
Australia is full of adventure, romance and tragedy. It is a
story that has not yet been told. Through these voyages the
history of Australia is linked with that of the Dutch East Indies
from the very beginning. Jansz, Dirk Hartog, Houtman, Carstensz,
Thyssens, Pelsart and Tasman--these and other Dutch discoverers
of 1606-1644 commenced the work of placing a continent on the map
which Cook triumphantly completed in 1770.</p>

<p>Australia's defence and its economy are as closely linked with
the Dutch East Indies as its history, though we have failed to
recognise it. The history, literature, science, art, music and
trade of these richly-productive and and densely-populated
countries which are our nearest northern neighbours are almost a
closed book to us. The war has taught us that we must open wide
that book of knowledge, if we are to survive as a factor in the
Pacific.</p>

<h2>The First Discovery of Australia.</h2>

<h3>With an Account of the Voyage of the "Duyfken" and the Career
of Willem Jansz.</h3>

<h2>By T. D. MUTCH.</h2>

<h4>(Read before the Royal Australian Historical Society, May 26,
1942.)</h4>

<p>The story of the finding of Australia, and particularly the
story of its first discovery, is one that has intrigued
historians and geographers ever since the country was first
inhabited. The possibility of its discovery from the west began
only after the Cape of Good Hope had been rounded by Bartholomew
Diaz in 1486, and, from the east, after Magellan had sailed
through his Strait into the Pacific in November, 1520; but it was
not until Europeans had been well established in the East Indies
that serious thought was given to the likelihood that other
richly productive</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 7}</u></p>

<p>lands existed in the wide wastes of southern oceans.</p>

<p>The Portuguese arrived in the Strait of Malacca in 1509, and d
'Abreu reached the Moluccas in 1512. These dates limit the period
of possible discovery from the north, but whatever information
d'Abreu or those who followed him may have gained from the
Malayans, the Arabs, or the Indian traders in the East Indies
concerning lands to the southward of their own, none of it
induced the Portuguese, so far as is known, to extend their
voyages into Australian waters.</p>

<p>Belief in the existence of a southern land of continental
dimensions was more in the minds of cartographers than of seamen,
and they exercised their fancy freely on the maps they drew,
combining the known with the unknown. Many a league of ocean was
sailed in the search for land that was not there--conjectural
coastlines of imagination.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<blockquote>[1) An illuminating instance of the wrong conclusions
that may be drawn from the evidence of maps alone, without the
evidence of voyages to support them, is provided in the case of
R. H. Major, who propounded the theory that because old French
maps showed land where Australia should be, while Portuguese maps
were blank in that region, and the names on the maps were in
Provencal French, Australia must have been discovered by a
Frenchman in the first half of the 16th century. He supported
this theory by producing a copy of a map by Guillaume le Testu.
Unfortunately for Major, the original Atlas dated April 5, 1555,
was inspected in Paris by an interested Dutchman, who found
something that had not been seen by Major. Opposite the map on
which appeared the greater part of the alleged "South Land" was
the following inscription: "This part is the same land of the
south called 'Australie' which has not yet been discovered,
because there is no record that anyone has yet searched it out,
and because it is only drawn from imagination: I can describe
nothing of its advantages, for which reason I shall leave more to
be said until more ample discovery has been made. Although I
have written and noted a few names on a few capes, this has only
been to correct the statements depicted here (which are) the
views of others; also in order that those who will be navigating
will take care when they think they are approaching the said
land."--Abstracted from I. Dornseiffen, "De Ontdekking van
Australien," in <i>Tijdschrift van het Aardrijksktundig
Genootschap</i> (1877), Deel 2, pp. 49-50.<br>
<br>
Apart from the revelation provided by the very frank Frenchman as
to the manner in which his map was compiled, this statement has
another interest. "Australie" is the French form of Australia,
and this, if not the earliest, must be one of the earliest uses
of the name as applied specifically to the region of the globe in
which Australia is actually located.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 8}</u></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the claims advanced on behalf of Spanish,
Portuguese and French navigators for the original discovery of
Australia, mainly based on this misleading guesswork of
cartographers, no evidence that will stand examination has been
produced in proof of a single voyage that resulted in the
discovery of any part of the known coastline of Australia until
the Dutch sent the <i>Duyfken</i> to examine the south coast of
New Guinea in 1606.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Of this historic voyage, with which the history of Australia
really commences, we have hitherto had but the merest fragments
of information, and most of the written histories of Australia
either dismiss it timidly, as if doubtful of its reality, or
mention it not at all. The <i>Duyfken</i> did not fall like a
bird out of the skies to light on a corner of Australia and then
vanish as swiftly into thin air; its voyage of discovery was part
of a pre-determined plan on the part of the merchants of the
Netherlands who controlled the Dutch East India Company to extend
their then limited possessions in the East--to seek new countries
and new peoples with which to trade.</p>

<p>Its failure in that respect to a substantial degree determined
the future of Australia. The Dutch merchants were more concerned
with commerce than with discovery; they had neither time,
vessels, nor money to spend upon non-essential exploration, and
it was both easier and more profitable to them, at that stage of
their enterprize, to take trading posts out of the failing hands
of the Portuguese than to send their vessels and their men
against the twin dangers of unknown coasts and hostile
savages.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the voyage had been fruitful, or had
shown prospects of profitable trade, Australia might well have
become a possession of the Netherlands. It was Fate alone that
determined that the <i>Duyfken</i> should have visited that
portion of Australia's shores which even to-day remains partly
unsurveyed and given over as reserves for its aboriginal
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Seventeen years were to elapse before the Dutch sent</p>

<blockquote>[1) For a convincing refutation of some of these
claims, see G. A. Wood, "Was Australia Known in the Sixteenth
Century?"--Royal Australian Historical Society's <i>Journal</i>
(1918), Vol. IV., pp. 201-240; also his <i>Discovery of
Australia</i> (1922).]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 9}</u></p>

<p>out another expedition for the purposes of exploration. Even
then, the voyage of the <i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i> of 1623 was
ordered in consequence of a number of discoveries, commencing
with that of the <i>Eendracht</i> in 1616, which were
accidentally made on the western coast of Australia, as a result
of an alteration of the sailing route from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Indies, directing the vessels, for a quicker passage, to
sail east in the region of the "roaring forties."</p>

<p>By 1642, these discoveries by the Dutch in Australian waters
were so extensive that it was decided to send out Tasman for a
more thorough examination of the southern seas. Tasman's famous
voyages of 1642 and 1644 not only proved the non-existence of a
continent in the southern Indian Ocean, but revealed the
existence of Tasmania and New Zealand, of Tonga and the Fijis,
and, on the second voyage, so linked the discoveries on the
Australian coast that three-fifths of the outline of Australia
was placed on his resultant map. All this was done by the Dutch
before the seamen of any other nation had seen any portion of
Australia, excepting, only the shipwrecked English sailors of the
<i>Trial</i> in May, 1622.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Even then, this extensive country did not attract the Dutch.
The fact is that the thousands of miles of northern, western and
southern coasts, from the vicinity of Cape York round to the head
of the Great Australian Bight, were for the most part barren and
offered no prospects of trade. It remained no man's land until
1770, when Lieutenant Cook, after examining Tasman's discovery of
New Zealand, decided to "steer westward until we fall in with the
E. Coast of New Holland." Thus, the extensive series of
discoveries of Australia by the Dutch from 1606 to 1644 led Cook
to turn west, instead of east, on his</p>

<p>homeward voyage from New Zealand, and, in consequence, to
alter also the apparent course of Australia's destiny.</p>

<p>It is my purpose here to re-assemble the fragments of
information printed in English, and to endeavour to reconstruct,
mainly out of material that has lain buried in the obscurity of
the Dutch language, the first of that series of voyages, which
enabled a commencement to be made with a drawing of a map of the
real, as distinct from the imaginary, Australian continent. At
the same time, it is hoped to sketch in the Dutch background of
the events in the East Indies which preceded the sending of the
<i>Duyfken</i> on her voyage of discovery.</p>

<h3><a name="ch01">THE COMING OF THE DUTCH TO THE EAST.</a></h3>

<p>Before the Portuguese sailed to India, the products of the
East--spices from the Indies (pepper, cloves and nutmegs); the
cinnamon of Ceylon; silk, porcelain and lacquer from China--had
been collected in native junks and taken to convenient trading
centres--Malacca, Bantam, Amboina, Ternate--from thence to be
conveyed by Hindu, Persian and Arab traders to the Gulf of Persia
or to the Red Sea, whence they were taken by overland caravans to
the ports of the eastern Mediterranean. There they were picked up
by Venetian and Genoese ships and distributed to the emporiums of
Europe.</p>

<p>In 1453, however, the Turks captured Constantinople, and
levied toll on the caravan routes. This so crippled the trade
that Portugal determined to find an ocean road. After a period of
ever-extending voyages down the west African coast, Diaz, and
later Vasco da Gama, found the way round the Cape, and opened
the gate to India and the Indies. When D'Albuquerque conquered
Malacca in 1511, he laid the foundation of Portuguese power in
the East; the spice trade was in the hands of Lisbon, and Venice
entered upon the sunset of her golden age.</p>

<p>From Lisbon, the cargoes of the Mediterranean, of West Africa,
and the East were taken to the markets of northern Europe mainly

Eastern trade, and a narrative as fascinating as that of Marco
Polo, inspired the Dutch with a new hope and a new determination:
they would fit out a fleet and seek the sources of supply for
themselves. They had, too, the man to lead it--Cornelis de
Houtman--who had secured, while in Lisbon, charts of the
Portuguese sea routes to the East Indies.<b style=

<p><b>(No. 2) The Four Vessels of the Dutch First Fleet.</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch02">THE FIRST FLEET OF THE DUTCH.</a></h3>

<p>The first fleet of the Dutch to the East Indies left Holland
on April 2, 1595. The vessels of that fleet were the
<i>Mauritius, Hollandia, Amsterdam</i>, and the <i>Duyfken</i>.
The larger vessels were described as being of 400 (English) tons,
and the <i>Amsterdam</i> of 200 tons; but the <i>Duyfken</i> was
a smaller vessel, and four different accounts give her tonnage as
30, 40, 50, and 50 tons respectively.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> The</p>

East Indies</i>, Vol. I. (1938).]</blockquote>

II. (Linschoten-Vereeniging, 1925), p. 117.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 12}</u></p>

<p><i>Duyfken</i> has always been described as a yacht or
pinnace, but that description has no relation to the modern use
of those terms. All these vessels were of the same
construction--all had three masts; the only difference between
the yacht and the other ships was the size. The <i>Duyfken</i>
carried twenty men, and was armed with two large and six small
guns and four stone-slingers. As she had to carry stores for a
journey half way round the world, and in case of separation would
have to depend on her own supplies, I think it most likely she
was at least 50-60 tons. I have not found another record of so
small a vessel as this making a voyage from Holland to the East
Indies. It has to be remembered, too, that as yet the Dutch had
not been able to arrange places on the route for the refreshment
of their crews.</p>

<p>In a purely commercial sense, the expedition was scarcely a
success. Before the ships reached Madagascar seventy men had died
of scurvy, and a small island on the south coast of that country
was inscribed on maps for many years as the "Dutchmen's
Graveyard." The commercial leader, Cornelis de Houtman, was not a
diplomat; he became embroiled in disputes with the natives, with
the Portuguese, and with his own men. Many lives were lost in
these quarrels; one ship, the <i>Amsterdam</i>, was abandoned and
burnt at the Island of Bawean, off the coast of Java; three of
the four skippers died.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> After an
absence of two and a half years the remaining three vessels
limped back to Holland on August 11 and 14, 1597, with
eighty-nine men out of a total of 249.</p>

<p>They had proved, however, that they could make the passage to
Java; that there was good trade to be done there; that the
Portuguese were not to be feared either as naval or commercial
rivals; and they had no sooner returned than steps were taken to
fit out a second fleet, larger and better equipped than the
first.</p>

<blockquote>[1) At Sidayu, Java, Schellinger, captain of the
<i>Amsterdam</i>, was presented with an "Eeme"--a cassowary,
coming from Ceram (Old Javanese, swari; Malay Javanese,
kasoewari; Portuguese, emaostrich; from the Arabic, na-ama, an
ostrich--compared by the Portuguese to a cassowary). It is from
the Portuguese word Ema--also spelt Eeme, Eme, Emeu--that we get
the name for the Australian Emu. The bird was taken to Amsterdam,
but Schellinger was murdered at Sidayu.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 13}</u></p>

<h3><a name="ch03">THE SECOND FLEET.</a></h3>

<p>This second fleet, which left Holland on May 1, 1598, under
the command of Admiral van Neck, comprised eight vessels,
including the <i>Mauritius</i> and the <i>Hollandia</i> of the
first fleet, a new vessel named the <i>Amsterdam</i>, and five
others named after provinces of the Netherlands--<i>Zeelandia,
Geldria, Utrecht, Vriesland</i>--and a smaller ship or "yacht"
named the <i>Overyssel</i>, which, "according to reliable
writings," was the former <i>Duyfken</i>.</p>

<p>On the <i>Hollandia</i> was Willem Jansz, as stuurman, or
mate; another member of the crew was Jan Lodewycksz. We thus have
introduced to the East Indies two men who were to become
associated, seven years later, in a voyage during which the first
discovery of Australia was made.</p>

<p>And what of the ship? Here I find myself confronted with a
problem of great perplexity. The question is: "Was the
<i>Duyfken</i> of the Dutch first fleet the same vessel that made
the first voyage with Europeans to Australia in 1606?" The
documents available to me do not provide an answer to this
question, which, in all probability, will be solved only by a
close inspection of the papers in the Rijksarchief at The Hague.
I can do no more than present the evidence available here.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>As previously stated, the <i>Duyfken</i> was one of the four
vessels which left Holland in 1595, three of which, including the
<i>Duyfken</i>, returned in 1597. The <i>Duyfken</i> does not
come into the record again until April 23, 1601, when a vessel of
that name sailed to the Indies as one of the fleet of Wolphert
Harmensz, under the command of Willem Cornelis Schouten, who in
1615-1616 was to achieve immortality with Jacob Le Maire by being
the first men to sail round Cape Horn, named after the town from
which they came, which was also the name of one of their
vessels.</p>

<blockquote>[1) Unless otherwise stated, the particulars of the
early Dutch voyages have been abstracted from Isaac Commelin,
<i>Het Begin ende Voortgangh der Vereenighde Nederlantsche
Geoctroyeerde Oost-Indische Compagnie</i> (1646)--(Beginning and
Progress of the United Netherlands Chartered East-India Company);
J. K. J. de Jonge, <i>De Opkomst van het Nederlandsch Gezag in
Oost-Indie</i> (1862 and following); and from the relative
publications of the Linschoten-Vereeniging.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 14}</u></p>

<p>What was the <i>Duyfken</i> doing between 1597 and 1601? It is
inconceivable that the prudent Dutch would waste a vessel which
had proved itself seaworthy and suitable for a world-wide voyage,
in trading between European coastal ports. Besides, they refitted
and sent out the other two vessels which had returned. We seem to
have found a partial answer in the statement that the
<i>Duyfken</i> was renamed the <i>Overyssel</i> for the second
voyage. But, in the best account of that voyage, we find the
contradictory statements (a) that the <i>Overyssel</i> was the
former <i>Duyfken</i>, and (b) that the vessel was of 45 lasten,
or 90 (English) tons. There were twenty men on the
<i>Overyssel</i>, and she carried an armament of two large and
six small guns, and four stone-slingers--exactly the same, in
each case, as the <i>Duyfken</i> of the first voyage.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b> One would think, therefore, that there
had been some mistake in the record of the tonnage, and that 45
lasten should read 25. But this would not solve the problem, as
the <i>Overyssel</i> returned, was refitted, and went out as the
<i>Overyssel</i> again in Admiral van Neck's second voyage, being
one of the advance guard of four ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob
Wilkens on December 21, 1599.</p>

<p>This vessel was actually in the East Indies when, on April 23,
1601, a <i>Duyfken</i> sailed from Holland in the fleet of
Wolphert Harmensz. The tonnage of the <i>Duyfken</i> of
Harmensz's fleet is given as 25 and 30 lasten<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b>; it returned to Holland in April, 1603,
and sailed again on December 18 of that year in the fleet of
Steven van der Hagen. This time the tonnage is given as 30
lasten. It is certain that they were one and the same vessel, but
I can find no explanation that will not leave gaps to be bridged
between the dates of the <i>Duyfken</i> of the first fleet
(1595-7) and that of Wolphert Harmensz (1601), and so am
compelled to leave it an open question, hoping, for the sake of
its interest in Australian history, that the archives of the
Netherlands, in the better days to come, will provide the
answer.</p>

<h3><a name="ch04">SUCCESS OF THE SECOND FLEET.</a></h3>

<p>We return now to Willem Jansz, whose first voyage to the
Indies was as mate on the <i>Hollandia</i> of the fleet of van
Neck. This voyage was a great success. On the way out, they
landed first at the island of St Laurence, or Madagascar, and
then at the island of Cerne, which they renamed Mauritius, after
the Stadtholder of the Netherlands. It appeared to be
uninhabited, but here they obtained an abundance of refreshment
for their crews. It became thereafter the principal place of call
for the Dutch fleets <i>en route</i> to and from the Indies.</p>

<p>At Bantam, in Java, van Neck was able to load four of his
vessels to the gunwales with spices, with which he returned to
Holland, showing a profit of 400 per cent. With him returned
Willem Jansz. The other four vessels were ordered to the
Moluccas--the first Dutch vessels to sail there. From Amboina,
Vice-Admiral van Warwyck went to Ternate with the
<i>Amsterdam</i> and <i>Utrecht</i>, while Vice-Admiral Jacob van
Heemskerck went to Banda with the <i>Gelderland</i> and
<i>Zeeland</i>, where he not only loaded his ships with a full
cargo of nutmegs and mace, but established two trading posts and
left men to look after them. One of the men he left, at Banda
Lontor, was Jan L&oacute;dewycksz.</p>

<h3><a name="ch05">WILLIAM JANSZ, FIRST MATE.</a></h3>

<p>As a result of the great success of van Neck's voyage, a large
fleet was organized. His four ships were overhauled, new ropes,
sails, anchors, victuals and merchandise were provided, and sent
out as an advance guard on December 21, 1599, under Vice-Admiral
Jacob Wilkens. This time, Willem Jansz went as opperstuurman, or
first mate, on the <i>Hollandia</i>. On his return from his first
voyage he had handed his log to Petrus Plancius, the famous Dutch
teacher of navigation, so that he could have been no ordinary
seaman.</p>

<p>On this voyage, too, went a second Jan Lodewycksz, as
opperkommies, or chief merchant, on the <i>Mauritius</i>. It was
the arrival of this man in the Indies that caused' the first one
of that name to add to his name the words "van Roossengin," no
doubt to avoid confusion. It has been</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 16}</u></p>

<p>assumed<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> that he gave this name
to the island Rozengain, of the Banda group; on the contrary, he
took his name from the island, no doubt from his personal
interest in it while stationed at Banda Lontor. Rozengain is the
most easterly of the Banda group, and one-half of it is to-day
occupied by a nutmeg plantation, the other half by djati (teak)
trees. Its name was known before the voyage of Magellan&mdash;del
Cano (1519-1522), as in Pigafetta's account of that voyage it is
referred to and charted as Rosoghin and Rossoghin.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> It was as Jan Roossengin (the surname is
spelt in various ways) that the first Jan Lodewycksz was
henceforth to be known.<b style="color:#0000FF">[3]</b></p>

<h3><a name="ch06">WILLEM JANSZ, CAPTAIN.</a></h3>

<p>It is not clear. upon what ship Willem Jansz returned to
Holland, but on May 5, 1601, a Willem Jansz sailed again for the
Indies as master of the <i>Lam</i>, in the "<i>Ram</i>,
<i>Schaep</i>, and <i>Lam</i>" fleet of Joris van Spilbergen.
During this voyage, Spilbergen named Table Bay in South Africa.
On the voyage Jansz was transferred, as mate, to the <i>Ram</i>.
They arrived off the northern coast of Sumatra on September 16,
1602, and, when Spilbergen went off with the English captains
Lancaster and Middleton to capture a richly-laden Portuguese
ship, the <i>Ram</i> stayed on the Sumatran coast. Our interest
here lies in the fact that when Steven van der Hagen left Holland
in December, 1603, with his fleet for the Indies, he carried with
him a chart of the. Malayan coast, prepared by Willem Jansz in
September&mdash;October, 1602. Again from the material available
in Australia, it is not possible to say how Jansz got back to
Holland; but if a chart could reach Holland so could the man who
made it, and it was Willem Jansz who went out with Steven van der
Hagen's fleet as captain of the <i>Duyfken</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i> had returned to Holland in February of that
year (1603) after a voyage to the Indies in the fleet</p>

<p>of Jacob Heemskerck, and under the captaincy of Willem
Schouten. From Bantam, part of the fleet had gone to Banda under
the command of Wolphert Harmensz. On arrival at Banda on March
14, 1602, they found Adriaen van Veen, who had been left there
with a party including Jan Lodewycksz, or Roossengin, since
1599.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the ships' officers on April 10, 1602, it was
decided to send the <i>Duyfken</i>, under the command of Schouten
and Super-cargo Claesz Gaeff, to Ceram, to visit some harbours
there, take in sago, and ascertain from the natives whether they
had any knowledge of the trade of New Guinea; in particular,
whether they had any knowledge of the Portuguese trading there.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> The report brought back was
inconclusive, but it would appear that the <i>Duyfken</i> visited
the island of Misool, off the west end of New Guinea, because
Harmensz's Journal relates that on that island "there is a great
demand for cloth, gold, gongs, iron, and swords."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> The <i>Duyfken</i> could not have been
out for more than two months, for on June 24, 1602, Harmensz
sailed for Bantam, where he left the Supercargo Claesz Gaeff and
the Sub-cargo Jan Lodewycksz (Roossengin) to look after the
company's stores and interests.</p>

<h3><a name="ch07">STEVEN VAN DER HAGEN'S FLEET.</a></h3>

<p>When the <i>Duyfken</i> was refitted, on her return to
Holland, she was placed under the command of Willem Jansz, and
sailed again to the Indies in the great fleet of Steven van der
Hagen on December 18, 1603. This fleet of twelve vessels was
better armed than any that had previously sailed, and the
instructions given to the Admiral read more like a war manifesto
than those of a commercial enterprize. He had to take a position
at Mozambique to attack the Spanish&mdash;Portuguese ships, after
which he was to go to the coast of India and burn the ships of
the enemy and display the flag of Holland before Goa, the centre
of Portuguese might in India. He was also to clear the</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 18}</u></p>

<p>Moluccas of the Spanish and the Portuguese. He was able to
bring about only minor and ineffective engagements with the
Portuguese on the coasts of India. When he reached Bantam,
however, on December 31, 1604, he heard that the fort of van
Verre, which he had himself established at Amboina on a previous
voyage (1599-1601), had been taken by the Portuguese, and he
decided to go there. After appointing Jan Willem Verschoor as
Chief Merchant at Bantam, he sailed for Amboina, where he
immediately made an attack on the Portuguese fort, which
surrendered in two days (February 25, 1605). Here he appointed
Frederik de Houtman<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> as Governor
of Amboina, the first territory the Dutch had secured for
themselves in the East Indies. His fleet then split in two, van
der Hagen sailing with the <i>United Provinces</i> and the
<i>Duyfken</i> to Banda, where he made contracts with the native
chiefs and gave command of the trading post to Super-cargo
Hendrik van Bergel.</p>

<h3><a name="ch08">THE VOYAGE OF THE "DUYFKEN."</a></h3>

<p>The orders of the Council in Holland to Steven van der Hagen
were that he was to leave his two smaller vessels, the
<i>Delft</i> and the <i>Duyfken</i>, in the Indies for at least
three years, to sail from one place to another for the purposes
of discovering new sources of trade to the advantage of the
company. Accordingly we find him in September, 1605, returning
with his fully-laden ship and the <i>Duyfken</i> to Bantam, from
whence he sailed for Holland in the following month. The
<i>Duyfken</i> remained at</p>

<blockquote>[1) Frederik de Houtman was a younger brother of
Cornelis de Houtman, leader of the first Dutch fleet to the East
Indies. In 1598 they made a second voyage, but at Achin, Sumatra,
Cornelis was killed (1599) and Frederik taken prisoner. In
August, 1601, he was freed by a Dutch fleet under Laurens Bicker.
Houtman was Governor of Amboina 1605-1611. On July 19, 1619,
Commander F. Houtman (of the <i>Dordrecht</i>) and Super-cargo
Jacob Dedel (of the <i>Amsterdam</i>) sighted the western coast
of Australia near Fremantle, and sailed north along the coast for
over 400 miles. Houtman's Abrolhos is a permanent memorial to his
name. During his imprisonment 'in Sumatra he compiled a
dictionary of Malayan. and Madagascan words, to which was added
an appendix on the declinations of many of the stars around the
South Pole.--D. Sepp: <i>Tresoor der Zee- en Landreizen</i>

<p>Bantam to be fitted with her requirements for the voyage to
"Nova ginnea," which was to become historic.</p>

<p>There would appear to be good reason to believe that the
voyage of the <i>Duyfken</i> for the discovery of New Guinea was
directed by Steven van der Hagen, in accordance with his
instructions. As he left almost immediately for Holland, however,
the responsibility for the furtherance of those instructions
would devolve on someone else. At that time, the chief Dutch
trading station in the East Indies was Amboina, which had been
taken from the Portuguese, and where a Governor, Frederik de
Houtman, had been appointed. The position of Verschoor at Bantam
was inferior to that of Houtman; he was a chief merchant, or
commercial agent.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<h3><a name="ch09">THE DIARY OF CAPTAIN SARIS.</a></h3>

<p>The English East India Company also had an agent at Bantam,
Captain John Saris, and on November 18, 1605, Captain Saris
entered the following record in his diary:--</p>

was returned to Banda, having found the Iland: but in sending

killed by the Heathens, which are man-eaters: so they were
constrained to returne, finding no good to be done there.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Captain Saris could not have foreseen that his brief entries
were to provide the first, the most important, and the only
contemporary record of a voyage during which the first discovery
of Australia had been made. Although the names of the ship and
its commander were not mentioned, and the extent of the voyage
was unrecorded, it was, and it remains, the only record that
gives the dates of the departure and return of this vessel. From
September, 1605, until March 4, 1607, no Dutch record of any kind
has been preserved that gives any reference to the movements of
the <i>Duyfken</i>. On the latter date, however, Paulus van Solt
made the following entry in his Journal:--</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1607, through God's mercy arrived before
the Castle [of Victoria, Amboina]...here we found...the yacht
Duyfken, which had come from Nova Guinea.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b></p>

<p>Whether this relates to the voyage which ended at Banda in
May, 1606, or to another voyage in New Guinea waters, which is
more likely, has not been established.</p>

<p>Captain Saris having provided us with the dates, for the names
of the ship and its officers we have to look to a Dutch document
written thirteen years later.</p>

<p>The United East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische
Compagnie), established under charter in 1602 with State support
and authority, and given a monopoly of the East Indian trade,
found itself obliged to protest against the claims of a rival
company--the Australische Company--which in 1615 had sent the
expedition of Schouten and Le Maire to the East Indies by way of
South America and the Pacific, and in a memorandum laid before
the Council on August 2, 1618, claimed that the new company
should be excluded from the territory between Ceylon and 100
miles east of the Solomon Islands:--</p>

<blockquote>[1) Nockhoda, master or proprietor of a trading
vessel; Cling-man--Kling, a Tamil from the mid-east coast of
India; Guzerats, traders from the west coast of India; Flemmings,
Netherlanders.]</blockquote>

Dutch...</i>]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 21}</u></p>

<p>...seeing that the United East-India Company has repeatedly
given orders for the discovering and exploring the land of Nova
Guinea, and the islands east of the same, since, equally by our
orders, such discovery was once tried about the year 1606 with
the yacht de Duyve by Skipper Willem Jansz and sub-cargo Jan
Lodewijs van Rosinghijn, who made sundry discoveries on. the said
coast of Nova Guinea, as is amply set forth in their journals.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>The next document that refers specifically to the voyage of
the <i>Duyfken</i> is the "Instructions to Commander Abel Jansen
Tasman," at Batavia on January 29, 1644, when he was "destined
for the further discovery. of Nova Guinea and of the unknown
coasts of the discovered East and South lands together with the
channels and islands presumably situated between and near the
same," wherein the earlier voyages were recounted:--</p>

<p>...the first was undertaken. in the year 1606 with the yacht
't <i>Duijffken</i>, by order of President Jan Willemsz Verschoor
(who then managed the Company's affairs in. Bantam) on which
voyage the Islands of Key and Arouw were visited in passing, and
the unknown south and west coasts of Nova Guinea were discovered
over a length of 220 miles from 5 to 13&frac34; degrees southern
latitude, it being only ascertained that vast regions were for
the greater part uncultivated, and certain parts inhabited by
savage, cruel black barbarians who slew some of our sailors, so
that no information was obtained touching the exact situation of
the country and regarding the commodities obtainable and in
demand there; our men having by want of provisions and other
necessaries been compelled to return and give up the discovery
they had begun, only registering in their chart, with the name of
Cape Keerweer, the extreme point of the discovered land in 131
degrees southern latitude.<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b></p>

<p>These three references have formed the basis of our limited
knowledge of the voyage of the <i>Duyfken</i> in 1605-6.
Together, they establish (a) the date of the voyage; (b) the name
of the ship, its captain and its sub-cargo or commercial
director, who, in accordance with Dutch practice of the time, was
in charge of the management of the voyage, as distinct from the
navigation; and (c) the extent of the voyage.</p>

whatever about them.</p>

<p>Reael's original inquiry was obviously a consequence of the
decision of the Directors on October 8, 1616, to send a second
expedition to extend the explorations of the <i>Duyfken</i>.
Instructions to that effect were in fact given, Reael reporting
to the Directors on May 10, 1617, that Cornelis Dedel had been
despatched from the Moluccas "to proceed to the discovery of the
southern lands, which undertaking had once previously been
engaged in by Jan Rossangin on the order of Admiral van der
Hagen." Dedel, however, did not go beyond Amboina, there becoming
engaged in other and more pressing duties.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b></p>

<p>It was not until 1623 that a second expedition went out
specifically for the discovery of the unknown south lands. This
was the expedition of the <i>Pera</i> and the <i>Arnhem</i>.
Fortunately the journal of Jan Carstensz, captain of the
<i>Pera</i>, has been preserved. This journal makes four
references to the voyage of the <i>Duyfken</i>, the track of
which was followed. These references will be mentioned later.</p>

<h3><a name="ch11">THE EVIDENCE OF MAPS.</a></h3>

<p>To these records, Professor Heeres adds the evidence of the
map "Indiae Orientalis nova descriptio," by Joannes Janssonius of
Amsterdam, from the <i>Mercator-Hondius</i> Atlas, new edition,
1633. There is no date on the face of this map, but it was
probably done about 1630. It</p>

<blockquote>[2) van Dijk, <i>Twee tochten</i>..., p. viii.; and
Heeres, <i>Part Borne by the Dutch...</i>]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 23}</u></p>

<p>contains five names obviously taken from a chart or map of the
<i>Duyfken's</i> voyage, all of them with slightly altered
spelling, which, in two cases at least ("eylandt" for "landt"),
alters the sense of the inscription, but all of them on the New
Guinea portion of the map. The place where Cape York Peninsula
should be is occupied by a scroll to enclose the mileage scale.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>On the other hand, the Henry Hondius map of 1630, which is
from the same atlas, and is described by C. H. Coote as "the
earliest attempt to delineate in a popular form the early
discoveries in the Gulf of Carpentaria, representing the
discoveries of Jansz and Carstensz," does not contain a single
name from the <i>Duyfken</i> voyage of 1606, but has only the
names given to the coast after the <i>Pera</i> voyage of 1623.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b></p>

<p>Philip Eckebrecht's map of 1630, which is the first world map
to include the discoveries of the Dutch on the coast of Western
Australia, also has the <i>Pera</i> geography only at the south
coast of New Guinea and the Gulf.<b style=

<h3><a name="ch12">HESSEL GERRITSZ'S MAP OF THE PACIFIC,
1622.</a></h3>

<p>Obviously unknown to Heeres, and re-located by Dr F. C. Wieder
in recent years, is a magnificent map of the Pacific Ocean by
Hessel Gerritsz, the great Dutch cartographer, which is not only
the first map upon which the lands discovered by the
<i>Duyfken</i> were inscribed, and therefore the first map to
contain any part of the actual, as distinct from the
hypothetical, mainland of Australia, but is the "Map of the Great
South Sea" so often consulted by Tasman when, in 1642, he
accomplished the remarkable feat of completely circumnavigating
the continent of Australia without seeing any of it, although on
the same voyage he discovered the southern coast of Tasmania, the
west coast of New Zealand, and some of the islands of the Tonga
and Fiji groups.</p>

<p>Marine in Paris. From the point of view of Australasian
historical geography it is one of the most important maps in
existence. It has never been published (although Dr Wieder in
1933 announced his intention so to do) and, so far as I can
ascertain, there is only one coloured copy of it; this is in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney, the Trustees having ordered a copy to
be made as soon as its discovery was made known to them by
Professor G. C. Henderson. Wieder says "the principal aim of the
map was to check the position of the Insulae Salomonis," but it
also sets down the track of Schouten and Le Maire and other
Pacific discoveries at that time known.</p>

<p>The date on this map is 1634, but it has been closely
examined by Dr Wieder and by Professor Henderson, and they agree
that the date has been deliberately altered, the real date being
1622. Henderson devotes a chapter to it in his <i>Discoverers of
the Fiji Islands</i>, and a photograph of portion of the
original, therein reproduced, and the facsimile of the original,
clearly support this contention, apart altogether from evidences
on the face of the map itself. For example, it is inconceivable
that Gerritsz, official cartographer to the East India Company,
if he had made so elaborate a map in 1634, would have failed to
place upon it the Dutch discoveries on the Western Australian
coast made between 1616 and 1622 which he had already placed on
his maps in 1627. Furthermore, Hessel Gerritsz died in 1632.</p>

<p>The western side of the map has the following inscription.
Translated it reads:--</p>

<p>Nieu Zeelandt east of Ceram sailed into by Jaspar Jansz de
Jonghe, Duyfkensland opposite Kei and Aru, Modder island, the
Vuyle-bancken and coast from 9 to 14 degrees sailed into by J.
Rosingein, the north coast of the Papuas with. its continuation
to 246 miles east of Maba travelled by J. le Mair, here laid down
as they are drawn by the named discoverers, were all held to be
parts of New Guinea. What more of these is found in the Spanish
maps, very different from one another, and not fitting well with
these parts, is here left out until more clarity is obtained.
These [parts] were sailed into with the yacht of Pedro Fernando
de Quiros about New Guinea on 10 degrees westwards through many
islands and dry banks and over 2, 3, and 4 fathoms for full 40
days. Presuming New Guinea not to stretch over the 10 degrees to
the south--if this were</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 26}</u></p>

<p>the case--then the land from 9 to 14 degrees must be separate
and different from the other New Guinea.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<h3><a name="ch13">DUTCH KNOWLEDGE OF TORRES STRAIT.</a></h3>

<p>This inscription lets in a flood of light on Dutch knowledge
of Torres Strait in or prior to 1622. First, it is clear that the
only information the Dutch had from their own navigators was that
gained on the voyage of the <i>Duyfken</i>. The reference to
Jasper Jansz de Jonge is taken from the <i>Duyfken</i> chart; the
reference to J. Roossengin is to the <i>Duyfken</i> voyage of
1606; the reference to Jacob le Maire is to his voyage across the
Pacific and along the north coast of New Guinea in 1615-1616. But
the reference to "the yacht of Quiros" indicates that Hessel
Gerritsz had come into possession of Spanish maps or manuscripts
that revealed the voyage of Torres, who had left Quiros at
Espiritu Santo and had sailed westward on 10 degrees through many
islands, dry banks and shallow waters "for full 40 days" (i.e.,
through Torres Strait), and if that were so it was to be presumed
that New Guinea could not extend below 10 degrees south latitude;
in which case, the land shown as extending to 14 degrees and
marked as New Guinea on the <i>Duyfken</i> chart (i.e., Cape York
Peninsula) must be a different land altogether. The Spanish maps
were "very different from one another," and did not fit in with
Dutch charting at all. Their longitudes were hopelessly
inaccurate. Therefore, the doubtful, cautious Dutch cartographer
left them out, although he had shown Torres Strait (unnamed) on
his world map of 1612.</p>

<p>This map makes it clear that the Dutch in 1622 were</p>

<blockquote>[1) Hessel Gerritsz published in Amsterdam in 1612 a
Dutch translation of the eighth memorial of Quiros, the title
page of which includes the words, "'t Land ghenaemt Australia
Incognita." This is believed to be "the earliest occurrence in
print of the word Australia outside Spain." The first to draw
attention to this interesting fact was Dr A. Lodewyckz: "The.
Name of Australia," <i>Victorian Historical Magazine</i> (1929),
Vol. XIII., pp. 99-115. The publication of 1612 referred to
included Isaac Massa's description of Siberia (Samoyeden Landt),
his short account of the roads from Muscovy, and the memorial
mentioned. It included three maps, one of which was a map of the
world by Gerritsz, in which Torres Strait is clearly shown.
Gerritsz was cartographer for the Netherlands East India Company,
1617-1632.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 27}</u></p>

<p>still not certain that Torres Strait existed. They were to
make other attempts to solve this problem for themselves
(Carstensz, 1623; Tasman, 1644; Gonzal and van Aasschens, 1756),
but it was to remain a problem until Cook cleared up the
"doubtful point" in 1770. Nevertheless, it will be noted that the
careful Gerritsz did not link up the discovered areas; he left
the Strait and the problem open "until more clarity is obtained."
On this evidence, historians must acquit the Dutch of concealing
knowledge of Torres Strait; they simply did not regard the
evidence of Spanish maps alone as sufficient--they had been
deceived by them before; the evidence of Torres' voyage did not
fit in with their own knowledge; nothing but proof of a voyage
would convince them. For which view there is much to be said.</p>

<h3><a name="ch14">THE "DUYFKEN" CHART.</a></h3>

<p>From whence did Hessel Gerritsz derive his information of the
Australian coast? The answer is revealed in a copy of the chart
of the <i>Duyfken's</i> voyage, which was brought to light and
published by Dr F. C. Wieder in his <i>Monumenta
Cartographica</i> in 1933. Australia has been thus provided with
a copy of the earliest record of its history.</p>

<p>Of the authenticity of this copy there can be no question. Its
history is as follows. Laurens van der Hem (1621-1678) was a
wealthy solicitor of Amsterdam, whose hobby was the collection of
maps. He already possessed a copy of Blaeu's atlas of eleven
volumes, and to this he added, in uniform style, and obviously
with the permission of the Directors of the Dutch East India
Company, copies of the original maps or charts belonging to that
company. They are all similar in style, colouring and
handwriting, and none of them have any compass lines. Dr Wieder
concludes, therefore, that they were all done by the one man, or
under the direction of one man, and, from evidences within the
atlas, about the year 1670.</p>

<p>This atlas was sold at public auction at The Hague in
November, 1730, a printed catalogue describing it sheet by sheet.
It was purchased by Prince Eugene of Savoy, whose heiress in 1737
sold his whole library to the Hofbibliothek in Vienna. It was
while examining this</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 28}</u></p>

<p>atlas, which is of forty-six volumes, first in 1920 and again
in 1931, that Dr Wieder found it to contain the "Secret Atlas of
the East-India Company "--copies of originals no longer in the
company's archives--and included were the charts of the voyages
of the <i>Duyfken</i> to New Guinea and Australia in 1606, and of
the <i>Arnhem</i>, which accompanied the <i>Pera</i> in 1623.</p>

<p>The chart of the <i>Duyfken</i> is unusually informative, in
that it shows the whole course of the vessel from Banda on the
outward and the homeward voyages; it shows the points on the
southern coast of New Guinea that, were first seen by Europeans;
it reveals the fact that the <i>Duyfken</i> visited the Kei and
the Aru Islands; it shows the actual landfall on the coast of
Australia; and it definitely locates the doubted position of Cape
Keerweer. It possesses, too, this additional merit: it delineates
the lands actually . located, and does not include coastlines of
conjecture. It is a good map, much clearer and more accurate in
its outline of the Carpentaria coastline than the later maps of
Arent Martensz de Leeuw, of the <i>Pera</i>, 1623, or that of
Tasman, 1644, and maps based upon them.</p>

<h3><a name="ch15">THE SOUTH COAST OF NEW GUINEA.</a></h3>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i> chart disposes of all previous speculations
as to the route of the voyage. After leaving Banda in September,
1605, under Captain Willem Jansz, in company with the <i>United
Provinces</i> under Admiral van der Hagen, the <i>Duyfken</i>
sailed to Bantam to be fitted and victualled' for her, voyage of
discovery. At Bantam she took on board Jan Lodewycksz van
Roossengin, who had been there since 1602, to act as Sub-cargo,
and left, as Saris states, On November 18, 1605. She would have
returned, via Amboina, where the company's headquarters were then
located, to Banda. The track from Bantam to Banda is not shown;
it was well enough known. In the absence of the log, it is not
possible to calculate with any . degree of accuracy the dates of
arrival or departure at various stages of the journey; one cannot
say how long the ship may have anchored at various places to
examine the country, make contact with the natives, and consider
the possibilities of trade. We may assume, however, that the
journey from Bantam to Banda would take at least a</p>

<p>month, and that therefore the new year had opened before the
<i>Duyfken</i> entered unknown waters.</p>

<h3><a name="ch16">THE VOYAGE OF TORRES.</a></h3>

<p>While Willem Jansz, in the <i>Duyfken</i>, was sailing east,
another famous navigator was sailing west. Quiros, in command of
a Spanish expedition, left Callao, Peru, on December 21, 1605,
with Torres as captain of one of his ships, the <i>San Pedro</i>.
The Dutch seamen were to sail across the western entrance to
Torres Strait, down into the Gulf of Carpentaria, recross the
Strait and return to Banda before Torres left the New Hebrides to
sail westward through the Strait that now bears his name. The
<i>Duyfken</i> was back at Banda before the end of May. Torres
left Espiritu Santo about June 28, and cleared the Strait early
in October.<b style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>From Banda the <i>Duyfken's</i> course was east-south-east to
the Kei group, where a call was made at the largest island,
passing north of some small islands, one of which was named Thore
(Tior of the Admiralty chart?). From Kei the island was turned on
the north, and a course set for Aru, where a call was made well
down the coast to a point that is clearly the present-day Dobo,
chief port now, and probably then. Leaving Aru, the same
east-southeasterly course was set, and the <i>Duyfken</i> reached
the New Guinea coast at De Jong's Point, in the bight formed
between Frederik Hendrik Island and the mainland.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> It is evident that the <i>Duyfken</i>
spent some considerable time</p>

<blockquote>[1) Captain F. J. Bayldon: "Voyage of Torres," Royal
Australian Historical Society's <i>Journal</i>, Vol. XI., p. 158;
Vol. XVI., p. 133.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[1) Carstenszoon's Journal, printed in Heeres's
<i>Part Borne by the Dutch...</i>, refers to this place as
"Keerweer, formerly mistaken for a group of islands by the men of
the <i>Duyfken</i> in the year 1606." The <i>Duyfken</i> chart
does not show it as a group of islands, but as a broken coast.
Moreover, the words on the chart are lowland and
muddy<i>land</i>, not "island." It would appear that the
<i>Pera</i> carried an imperfect copy of the original chart. The
Keerweer of the <i>Pera</i>, on the New Guinea coast, has
deceived some historians, who believed that this was the furthest
point reached by the <i>Duyfken</i>. The Keerweer of the
<i>Duyfken</i> was on the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Keerweer means, literally, a blind alley, or cul-de-sac; used
nautically for "turn about"--hence "turn again."]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 31}</u></p>

<p>there endeavouring to find a way through to the south, but the
Princess Marianne Strait, which runs through, would be too
difficult for the <i>Duyfken</i> to tack in. Coming out, she
rounded the long shoal off False Cape and headed south through
the Arafura Sea until she was in the waters of the Gulf of
Carpentaria.</p>

<h3><a name="ch17">THE DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA.</a></h3>

<p>If she had then turned west she would soon have reached the
coast of Arnhem land; instead, she turned south-east and met the
coast of Australia at the mouth of the Pennefather River, on the
Cape York Peninsula. There can be no mistake about this locality.
The latitudes on the chart are out by many minutes, but the
physical features on the chart are unmistakeable. There is a
large river shown to the north which can be identified as the
Batavia; there is a large bay to the south which is clearly
Albatross Bay--it can be nowhere else. The Pennefather River is
midway between, and here we have the landfall of the
<i>Duyfken</i> more certainly than we have the landfall of
Captain Cook at Point Hicks.</p>

<p>On the <i>Duyfken</i> chart it is named "R. met het
Bosch"--river with the bush. Our Admiralty chart (No. 445) gives
it as the Coen River, an ancient error (derived from the 1802
survey of Flinders, who carried Thevenot's inaccurate map), which
one would not expect to see maintained on an Admiralty chart.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Proceeding due south, and crossing Albatross Bay (named Vliege
Bay on the chart, a name subsequently placed on the map of
Tasman), the next feature shown can again be identified beyond
doubt, both by its position and. its name; it is described as
"Dubbelde Rev" (Double River); it is in fact a double river,
since here at Archer Bay empty the Archer and the Watson Rivers,
though Queensland official maps, and not Admiralty charts, must
be examined for the necessary identification.</p>

<p>The same applies to the next river south, given on the chart
as "R. Vis." This is shown on the Queensland</p>

<blockquote>[1) It is from the Dutch word "bosch" that we derive
the word "bush" as applied to country away from the towns. Here
we find it in the first place name given to any part of
Australia!]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 32}</u></p>

<p>four-mile maps as the Dugally River. Hessel Gerritsz, on his
map of 1622, extended the spelling to "R. Visch," and here one
might reasonably assume that the men of the <i>Duyfken</i> threw
out their lines or nets and obtained a good haul of fish, which
led them to express their appreciation by naming the place in
token of the occasion. On the Tasman map the name of "Visschers
revier" has been given to the coast in this locality, which has
misled many into the belief that Tasman's pilot, Francis
Visscher, was thus honoured. The <i>Duyfken</i> chart disposes of
that illusion.</p>

<h3><a name="ch18">CAPE KEERWEER.</a></h3>

<p>The last point named on the chart is Cabo Keerweer, placed in
latitude 13.40 south. Its actual location is 13.59. Again, the
identification is easy; south of it, the coast bears away
south-south-east, as it does in fact. There is nothing at Cape
Keerweer to distinguish it from any other part of the low, sandy
coast north and south. Carstensz, of the <i>Pera</i>, whose log
has been preserved and published, does not mention it; Tasman's
journal has not been found, but it is placed on his map nearly a
degree too far south.</p>

<p>Matthew Flinders, who was the next navigator to go so far down
the Carpentaria coast, in 1802 sought for it, and said:--</p>

<p>"I could see nothing like a cape here; but the southern
extreme of the land, seen from the masthead, projects a little,
and from respect to antiquity the Dutch name is there preserved.
We passed the southern extremity of Cape Keerweer, round which
the coast falls back somewhat; the water then' became more
shallow, and did not admit of being safely approached nearer than
4 miles."</p>

<p>The little <i>Duyfken</i>, equipped no doubt for a voyage of
about six months' duration, had now been out from Bantam nearly
four months; day after day she had been sailing along a flat,
uninteresting coastline, with no sign of a village anywhere, no
sign of a hill from the masthead, and every attempt at a landing
opposed by naked, hostile aboriginals with spears in their hands.
The land was getting even lower and the waters shallower;
supplies were getting short, with no prospect of replenishment;
there seemed nothing to be gained by going further--it was
time</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 33}</u></p>

<p>to turn back. The <i>Duyfken</i> swung round and headed north
again.</p>

<h3><a name="ch19">THE BATAVIA RIVER.</a></h3>

<p>The chart shows that the explorers sailed into and examined
Vliege Bay, to the north point of which Flinders gave the name of
Duyfken Point.</p>

<p>Passing the. first place of landfall--the Pennefather
River--the <i>Duyfken</i> must have entered a very large river
and examined it with a boat for over twenty miles; it is clearly
marked on the chart, though left unnamed. It cannot be any other
than the present . Batavia, which is navigable for nearly forty
miles, the tide being five feet at that distance from the mouth.
I have no doubt that it is the same as the river named Carpentier
in the <i>Pera's</i> log, which name was cancelled, and Batavia
substituted, on the chart of de Leeuw, the <i>Pera's</i>
steersman.</p>

<p>It is this river to which Carstensz refers in the
<i>Pera's</i> journal as "a large inlet, which the men of the.
<i>Duyfken</i>, in the year 1606, went into with the boat, and
one man was killed by the missiles of the savages."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b> Carstensz went ashore in this locality
(May 12, 1623) and was met by 200 natives,</p>

<p>"making a violent noise, and with their spears ready to throw,
and evidently very distrustful, for though pieces of iron and
other things were thrown to them, they would not stop to parley,
but tried every trick with the object of wounding and capturing
one of our men. This compelled us to fire one or two shots to
frighten them, one of them being hit in the breast and carried to
the boat, while all the others retired into the sand dunes. In
their wretched huts on the beach we found nothing but a
four-edged assegai, two or three little stones and some human
bones with which they make and scrape their weapons. We also
found a quantity of resin and a piece of"</p>

<blockquote>[1) Batavia River: Concerning the name of this river
there has been much confusion. Jan Carstensz, in his log, named
it the Carpentier, but in the "summary extract" from his log the
name was erased from the original MS. On the chart of Arent de
Leeuw, steersman of the <i>Pera</i>, it is named the Batavia; on
Tasman's map of 1644 it is named the Prince, with a Revier
Carpentier placed just north of Albatross (Vliege) Bay, but no
Batavia River; Aaschens, of the ship Buijs, in 1756 renamed it
the Batavia; it was identified as such by Flinders in 1802, and
the Batavia it remains.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 34}</u></p>

<p>"metal, which the wounded man had in his net, and which had
probably been got from the Duyfken's men. At last, there being
nothing more to be done here, we turned back' to go aboard the
ship, the wounded man dying on the way."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>A short distance north of the Batavia River, the
<i>Duyfken</i> chart indicates the entrance to two small rivers,
one of which would probably be the present Skardon, a point which
must be Vrilya Point, and further north, near the top of the
mainland coast, a small. island, opposite which the word "Moent"
is inscribed. For this name I cannot find an equivalent; it is
neither Dutch nor Malayan, but as the <i>Duyfken</i> would have
picked up a native pilot or interpreter at the Kei or Aru islands
to facilitate intercourse with the natives in the new lands they
were visiting, it may be a spelling of some word in another
Indonesian language. There is a small island on the western
corner of the Cape York Peninsula which has only recently made
its appearance on Admiralty charts as "Crab Island," situated in
the same locality.<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b> This part of
the Carpentaria coast has not yet been thoroughly surveyed. There
are rivers there that find their way to the sea, but have not yet
found their way on to a map. The Van Speult of the <i>Pera</i>
chart is one of them.</p>

<h3><a name="ch20">TORRES STRAIT.</a></h3>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i>, continuing the voyage north, now left the
mainland, with Cape York over thirty miles to the north-east, and
sailed wide to pass, first the small islands of Wallis and Red
Wallis, which are indicated, and then "'t Hooge Eylandt" (the
high island--now Prince of Wales Island), to which a visit was
made; and still sailing</p>

Moendi are place names on Great Kai Island, Celebes and Bali. I
have not found the meaning of these names. The Dutch spelling of
the Malayan word for monkey is "moenyet." It is here noted as a
matter of curious interest only that on the Cape York Peninsula
is found a marsupial like an opossum with a prehensile tail
devoid of fur for half its length. Its scientific name is

and into the "Vuyle Bancken"--the impassable coral reefs between
Jervis Island and the mainland of New Guinea.</p>

<p>The fact that they were at the western side of Torres Strait
would not be known to them--Torres had not yet arrived at the
island of Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, which he reached
with Quiros on May 1, 1606, and his subsequent passage through
the strait was not revealed to the world for over 150 years.<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b> Even so, the <i>Duyfken</i> chart
does not show it as a continuous coast; the question is honestly
left open, and the <i>Duyfken</i>, baffled by reefs, winds,
currents, sand banks and coral reefs, sailed west and north to
round False Cape, called into the bight above Frederik Hendrik
Island again, leaving on the chart only the description of the
land--"laeghlandt" and "modderlandt" (lowland, muddyland)--and a
name, "Tiuri."<b style="color:#0000FF">[2]</b> This again has
puzzled geographers. It appears on Hessel Gerritsz's map, and on
the maps of Janssonius and Tasman, slightly altered--"Tyuri" and
"fuiry." I have searched for its meaning without success, but it
is interesting to note that when Flinders accompanied Bligh on
his voyage with the <i>Providence</i> and <i>Assistant</i> in
1792, the natives of Darnley Island at the</p>

<blockquote>[1) Reporting the arrival of the <i>Arnhem</i> at
Banda on April 14, 1623, Governor Isack de Brune, in a letter to
Governor-General Carpentier, said that at the place where the
chart they had with them (i.e., the <i>Duyfken</i> chart) led
them to expect a passage, they did not find any such, so that
they could not get to the island they wished to reach.--Heeres:
<i>Part Borne by the Dutch...</i>, p. 47.<br>
<br>
<p>Tasman's instructions (January 29, 1644), based on the voyages
of the <i>Duyfken</i>, the <i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i>,
required him to cautiously follow the shallow bay in latitude 9
degrees south (i.e., western end of Torres Strait) and then come
to anchor near the High Island (Prince of Wales Island) and send
his galiot into the bay for two or three days "for the purpose of
ascertaining whether there is any passage to the South' Sea, a
fact that may be settled in this way or by the direction of the
current." Tasman's map shows that he endeavoured to do this, but
he did not succeed, though he went into the "bay" for a
considerable distance. It was left for Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> to
find the passage from the eastern side.]</p>

(Amsterdam, 1898), p. 149, it is spelt "Ture."]</blockquote>

<p>eastern end of Torres Strait came out in canoes "and asked for
'toore-tooree', by which they mean iron."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>The <i>Duyfken</i> spent no time in further exploration of the
New Guinea coast, but heading north-west before the . wind made
no doubt a fast passage until she hit the coast again about Cape
Namaripi, then bore away south-west to a point between the Kei
and Aru islands, at which she did not call on the return
journey, 'thence west and home to Banda, arriving there some time
in the month of May. By June 15, Nockhoda Tingall had sailed the
long journey--1700 miles--to Bantam and reported her return.</p>

<p>For the first time in history, the <i>Duyfken</i> had placed
on a chart over 200 miles of the Australian coastline. The Dutch
believed it to be a part of New Guinea, and continued to so
believe after the voyages of Carstensz and Tasman, who made vain
attempts to find a passage through the islands, shoals and coral
banks of Torres Strait.</p>

<p>The fact is that no ship ever succeeded in discovering the
channels in Torres Strait by sailing from west to east; all were
discovered by vessels from east to west.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> That the Dutch suspected there was a
passage there after Tasman's voyage of 1644 is shown in a letter
of Governor-General Van Diemen to the. Governor of Banda in
November of that year, after Tasman's return, in which he gave
instructions that a vessel was to be sent to "make for the great
river which our men have christened Waterplaets,' to sail up the
said river landward, in which there is the less difficulty, since
the river, being deep and wide, can be sailed up by the yacht,
which can conveniently turn, veer and tack in it."<b style=

<p>This voyage was never made. If it had been, Cook's discovery
of 1770 might have been anticipated by 125 years.</p>

<h3><a name="ch21">THE CHART'S INSCRIPTIONS.</a></h3>

<p>The maker of the <i>Duyfken</i> chart was honest, even to the
inscription. It states:--</p>

<p>This chart shows the track followed by, the yacht The
<i>Duijfien</i> both on the outward and the homeward voyage when
visiting the islands east of Banda up to New Guinea. But Guliguli
on Cenam, and Ceram, etc. are done after the drawing of Abraham
Francken, 1602, 20th April; and Nieuw Zelandt with the Gounangapi
east of it had been sailed into by Jasper Janssen de Jonge.</p>

<p>The latter portion of this inscription is an obvious reference
to the voyage of inquiry made by the <i>Duyfken</i> when she went
to Ceram from Banda in April, 1602, under the orders of Wolphert
Harmensz, with Schouten as captain; and to a voyage made by
Jasper Janssen (or Jansz) to the Kumawa peninsula at the
south-western end of New Guinea at some other date. Abraham
Francken was probably a mate on the <i>Duyfken</i> in 1602. The
name of Jasper Janssen appears again as chief merchant at Amboina
in 1608; he was Lieutenant-Governor in 1610, and succeeded
Frederik de Houtman as Governor of Amboina in 1611.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>The appearance on the chart of Ceram and Nieu Zelant (Kumawa
peninsula), though not visited by the <i>Duyfken</i> on this
voyage, is thus fully accounted for. The Gounongapi (gunung,
mountain; api, fire) shown apparently as a reef or shoal is
really an eye view of the volcanic range which lies above Triton
Bay; while "marasichlandt," if intended to mean "marshy land,"
would be a correct description of Adi Island, to which it is
applied.</p>

<p>The name "Os Papuas," given to the most northerly part of the
coastline of New Guinea at which the <i>Duyfken</i> touched on
the return voyage, has been altered to "Duyfkenslandt" on the
Hessel Gerritsz map of 1622, and incorrectly transcribed as
"Duyfken's Eylant" on the</p>

<blockquote>[1) J. K. J. de Jonge: <i>De Opkomst van het
Nederlandsch Gezag</i>, Vol. III., p. 397.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 39}</u></p>

<p>Janssonius map. The inscription on the Australian portion of
the chart is: "Nova Guinea. All this coast is low land."</p>

<p>The only <i>Duyfken</i> place name that remains on the maps
to-day is Cape Keerweer. It is surprising that, although the
<i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i> carried a chart of this coast which
must have been drawn after the <i>Duyfken's</i> voyage, not one
name has been transcribed to the map of the <i>Pera's</i> voyage,
and not one reference to <i>Duyfken</i> names appears in the
<i>Pera's</i> log. On the other hand, four <i>Duyfken</i> names
on the Australian coast appear on Tasman's map of 1644--Revier
met Bosch, Vliege Bay, Visscher's (Vis) revier, and Cap
Keerweer.</p>

<p>We must express our gratitude to Dr Wieder for the discovery
of this chart, because, as he says, "before 1606 no map was drawn
on which a real portion of Australia was put down from
observations. All prior to that was from, conjecture." We have
here, therefore, the first record of the history of our country,
and I suggest that when opportunity offers, and if it still
remains, we should endeavour to have a coloured copy made, to
take its place in 'the Mitchell Library with the Tasman map of
1644 and with the copy of the Gerritsz map of the Pacific.</p>

<h3><a name="ch22">JAN ROOSSENGIN.</a></h3>

<p>After the return of the <i>Duyfken</i> to Banda from
Australia, we have no record of her movements until Paulus van
Solt reports her at Amboina in March, 1607. In June of that year,
the Sub-cargo, Jan Roossengin, was placed in charge of sea
operations at Ternate by Admiral Matelieff, and the
<i>Duyfken</i> was one of the vessels under his control. Early in
the following year, however, the Portuguese came to the Moluccas
in force, and Roossengin was forced to go to Amboina for aid. He
joined the <i>Delft</i> there (on which Willem Jansz was
captain), and in a letter written on that vessel on May. 8, 1608,
he says he had a running fight with the Portuguese for five
hours, during which' eighty shots were fired, (at the
<i>Duyfken</i>), but they did not do any damage.</p>

<p>With the fleet of Admiral van Caerden they sallied forth from
Amboina and put' the Portuguese to rout, and</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 40}</u></p>

<p>took the island of Makian. This was in June, 1608. Shortly
after this engagement, the Duyfken seems to have met her fate.
Captain Saris, the English Company's agent at Bantam, makes
another entry in his diary:--"1608. The first of September
arrived a small pinnasse of the Flemmings from Mackian, by whom
we understood of two ships called the China and the Dove
(Duyfken) were cast away, riding at anchor afore Mackian."<b
style="color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>And, to place all doubts at rest, Jacques le Hermite, Chief
Merchant at Bantam., wrote to the Directors at Amsterdam in
November, 1608, reporting the success of Admiral van Caerden at
the Moluccas, and added:--</p>

<p>"The <i>Duyfken</i> is burst in the doubling,<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[2]</b> so that it was necessary to send some
ships thither with food and other things."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[3]</b></p>

<p>Jan Roossengin afterwards returned to Holland, but he was back
in the Indies in 1611. He was merchant at Tidore in February,
1613, and spent the next five years fighting galleons, capturing
junks, wrecking and being wrecked, up and down the archipelago
from Manila to, Macassar. His ship, the <i>Roode Leeuw</i> (Red
Lion), on July 29, 1617, broke its anchors and "went on the
wall." He spent his breaks on shore signing documents for
Governors-General Reael and Coen, as "fiscal representative," but
after March, 1618, he fades from history. Although as sub-cargo
Jan Lodewycksz van Roossengin was the superior of Captain Jansz
on the <i>Duyfken</i> voyage, he did not remain so long in the
company's service, and does not figure with the same prominence
in Dutch colonial history<b style="color:#0000FF">[4]</b></p>

<p>On the Hessel Gerritsz Map of the Pacific of 1622 he is given
pride of place: "...coast from 9 to 14 degrees sailed into by J.
Rosingen," and "...the continuation of that which is here called
Nova Guinea sailed into by Jan Rosengein A.D. 1606."</p>

<h3><a name="ch23">THE CAREER OF WILLEM JANSZ.</a></h3>

<p>Having traced the outline of the career of Willem Jansz for a
few years prior to the voyage to Australia, it is perhaps
appropriate that I should relate what is known of his subsequent
career. For this I am entirely indebted to an interesting
monograph by Pieter Arend Leupe, <i>Willem Jansz of Amsterdam and
Willem Jansz of Amersfoort</i>, which has never been printed in
English. So far, Willem Jansz has never been anything but a name
to us. Now it will be seen that he became a man of great
distinction, that he made a second discovery of the shores of
Australia, and that he rose to the rank of Admiral.</p>

<p>Leupe was in a particularly good position to ascertain the
facts, as, after a long career in the Netherlands army, from
which he retired with the rank of Major, he was appointed to a
position in the Rijksarchief in 1863, and remained there until
his death in 1881. He thus had access to original documents, and
his work, which is highly regarded and frequently quoted by Dutch
historians, is therefore of particular value. The paper from
which I have prepared this summary was written in 1872, and it
may be that additional matter, not yet published, has come to
light.</p>

<p>Very soon after the return of the Duyfken from Australia,
Willem Jansz left that vessel and appears to have gone to
Bantam.</p>

<p>On October 5, 1606, Captain Saris made another entry in his
diary. It read:--</p>

<p>"The <i>West Frisland</i> arrived here from Ternata; whence
she was beaten by the Spaniards: she was not above halfe-laden
with mace, cloves, and cotton-yarne."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Jansz was given command of the <i>Westfriesland</i>, to take
her home to Holland. He met with misfortune, however, on the
voyage, for the <i>Westfriesland</i> had to be abandoned at
Mauritius, and Jansz was obliged to return to Bantam. When
Admiral Matelieff arrived there on November 24, 1607, he sent
Jansz on the <i>Madagascar</i> with secret instructions to Banda
to forestall the English ships</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Purchas His Pilgrimes</i> (1625), Vol. I., p.
385.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 42}</u></p>

<p>under Captain Middleton which were reported to be on their way
there.</p>

<p>Jacques le Hermite, writing to the Administrators on January
26, 1608, stated that:--</p>

<p>"The yacht <i>Madagascar</i> was loaded...and sailed on
December 4 for Amboina and Banda in order to give notice of the
arrival of two English ships at Bantam. Willem Jansz, formerly
captain of the <i>Westfriesland</i>, was placed on her as
captain.</p>

<p>Governor Houtman, of Amboina, writing to Hendrik van Bergel,
merchant at Banda, on January 2, 1608, said that he had received
a letter from "the Admiral Matelieff arrived by the yacht
<i>Madagascar</i>, on which the captain is Willem Jansz, formerly
of the <i>Duyfken</i>." Houtman and Bergel both knew Jansz as
captain of the <i>Duyfken</i>, and this proves that Jansz of the
Duyf ken and Jansz of the <i>Westfriesland</i> were one and the
same man.</p>

<p>Having fulfilled his mission, Jansz returned to Amboina, where
he was given command of the yacht Delft (April 20, 1608), with
Jan Roossengin on board, and, under Admiral Pouwels van Caerden,
took part in the capture from the Spaniards of the Island of
Makian. Van Caerden wrote very highly of him, and Jansz, whose
term of service had expired, was engaged for a further term and
given command of the <i>Eendracht</i>. He was sent on important
missions on this vessel to Achin (Sumatra), Ceylon and India
(October 15, 1609). While on the way to Ceylon he fought and
captured from the Portuguese a new ship which had come from the
coast of Bengal, with a cargo mainly of sugar.</p>

<p>On the return of Jansz to Bantam, at the end of 1610, his
longing to return home got the upper hand. He was therefore
signed on the <i>Orangie</i> as Chief Merchant, sailed from
Bantam on January 11, 1611, and reached Zeeland on August 23. The
Chamber of Zeeland thought highly of his services, as is shown in
a letter in which they described him as</p>

<p>"a very competent and sober man, who has pleased us greatly by
his account of trade in the East, and it would be well if the
Company had many such servants, when it would be more likely that
the government would be better than we sometimes hear."</p>

<p>In endorsement of their good opinion, the Chamber signed Jansz
on again for three years at 100 guilders a month,</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 43}</u></p>

<p>and on December 29 he sailed again for the Indies in command
of the <i>Orangie</i>. With the fleet went also a yacht named the
<i>Duyfken</i>, a new vessel. The <i>Duyfken</i> was ever a
popular name for a small Dutch ship.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<h3><a name="ch24">JANSZ AS GOVERNOR OF SOLOR,
1614-1615.</a></h3>

<p>The <i>Orangie</i> took part in various cruises against the
enemy until she had her mast shot off near Ternate, and retired
to Amboina. Refitted, she took in cargo and returned to Bantam,
when Governor-General Pieter Both, the first Governor-General of
the Dutch East Indies, had alarming news from the island of
Solor, centre of the sandalwood trade from Timor and other
islands. The natives of this island, which had been captured from
the Portuguese some time before, had risen in insurrection
through the influence of some Portuguese who had been allowed to
remain, and murdered the Governor and several others.</p>

<p>Jansz was immediately sent to Solor with a force to restore
order, with a commission as Governor, Both justifying this
unusual appointment because of extreme urgency and explaining
that Jansz "was by nature mild, modest and unassuming, who had
acquitted himself properly during his time on the <i>Orangie</i>,
and never had the slightest trouble with his crew, and always
maintained order on his ship."</p>

<blockquote>[1) For the spelling of the name "<i>Duyfken</i>"
(Little Dove), I have searched every page of Vols. 2 and 3 of de
Jonge's <i>De Opkomst...</i> in which is reprinted the text of
contemporary documents from the Dutch East Indies archives, and
found that the name was spelt in eight different ways--in one
case, four different ways in the one (lengthy) document. In order
of frequency the spellings are:<br>
<br>
<i>Duyfken</i> (12), <i>Duyfke</i> (7), <i>Duyffken</i> (4),
<i>Duyffgen</i> (4), <i>Duyfgen</i> (4), <i>Duifje</i> (1),
<i>Duifke</i> (1), and <i>Duijfje</i> (1). The forms
<i>Duyfken</i> and <i>Duyfke</i> alone are used throughout the
period 1595 to 1608, that is, from the first voyage to the last.
In no case did I find <i>Duifhen</i> (frequently used by English
writers), and the form <i>Duifken</i> appears only in Heeres's
text. The copy of the original chart herein referred to is the
only place in which the form <i>Duijfien</i> is used. The latest
and best authority is the Linschoten Society, and in <i>Tresoor
der Zee--en Landreizen...</i>, by D. Sepp (1939), which is an
encyclopaedic index to the first twenty-five volumes of that
Society's publications, the form used is <i>Duyfken</i> for all
references.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 44}</u></p>

<p>Willem Jansz quickly put things in order at Solor, but the
following year Director-General Jan Pieterzoon Coen decided to
abandon the fort on Solor, not to give up the Timor trade, but to
conduct that trade from Amboina or Banda.</p>

<p>In June, 1616, Jansz's term of service had again expired, and
he decided to return to Holland, although Governor-General Reael
wished to retain his services. He was given the position of Chief
Merchant on the <i>Zeelandia</i>, and reached Zeeland on June 30,
1617. By this time, however, the homeland had lost its
attractions. Possibly. his friends and relatives had become
scattered. during his years of absence, and he again accepted an
engagement in the company's service as Upper Clerk and Merchant
at 150 guilders a month, to be engaged in the first vacant
position as Vice-Governor or as Commander on water.</p>

<h3><a name="ch25">SECOND AUSTRALIAN DISCOVERY BY JANSZ.</a></h3>

<p>On January 4, 1618, therefore, Willem Jansz set sail again for
Java as Supercargo on the ship <i>Mauritius</i>, with Captain
Lenaert Jacobsz. When they arrived. at Bantam on August 22, Jansz
reported that on July 31, in 22 degrees south latitude, they had
discovered an island and had landed there. For the second time,
Willem Jansz had made a discovery of part of the Australian
coast. The log of the ship has not been found, but the letter of
Jansz reporting the discovery fortunately remains, and is here
reproduced. Thus we are able, by a piece of extraordinary good
fortune, to present a copy of a letter written by the man who
first discovered Australia. The first portion of this letter
reads as follows:--</p>

<p>"(Letter of Supercargo Willem Jansz to the Managers of the
Amsterdam Chamber, October 6, 1618.)</p>

<p>"Worshipful Wise Provident Discreet Gentlemen.</p>

<p>"The present serves only to inform you that on the 8th of June
last with the ship <i>Mauritius</i> we passed Cape de bon
esperence, with strong westerly winds, so that we deemed it
inadvisable to call at any land, after which we ran a thousand
miles to eastward in 38 degrees southern latitude, though we
should have wished to go still further east.</p>

<p>"On the 31st of July we discovered an island and landed on the
same, where we found the marks of human footsteps: on the west
side it extends N.N.E. and S.S.W.; it measures 15 miles in
length, and its northern extxremity is in 22 deg. S. lat. It
bears S.S.E."</p>

<blockquote>[1) Translation from J. E. Heeres <i>Part Borne by
the Dutch..., p. 12.</i>]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 46}</u></p>

<p>Jansz, in this letter, has obviously described the peninsula
on the coast of Western Australia from Point Cloates to
North-West Cape. The deep Exmouth Gulf, which he probably entered
in a boat, would no doubt lead him to believe the peninsula to be
an island. Soon after the discovery, the name of Willems River
appeared on Dutch maps, being first shown on Hessel Gerritsz's
map of 1618-1628. While it is impossible to locate Willems River
with any certainty, Dutch historians claim that it is the
Ashburton, but after a close examination of a modern chart I am
inclined to the opinion that it was an opening to the Exmouth
Gulf.</p>

<p>The last portion of the letter relates that the Mauritius lost
forty-one men from scurvy, and advises the managers of the
company in Holland what goods were required to be sent out to the
Indies.</p>

<p>Immediately after his arrival at Bantam, Jansz was transferred
to the <i>Wapen van Amsterdam</i>, and was called into
consultation by the Council of the Indies.</p>

<h3><a name="ch26">BATAVIA ESTABLISHED.</a></h3>

<p>The English in the East were now becoming formidable rivals.
They frequently offered better prices for spices and bought
cargoes that the Dutch had hoped to secure. The secret mission of
Jansz to Amboina and Banda, for example, had been to buy up all
the spice cargoes in sight so that there would be none left when
Middleton's ships arrived. The native grandees watched this
competition with great satisfaction, and played the
rivals--Portuguese, English, and Netherlanders--against one
another. There had never been anything but active hostility
between the Dutch and the Portuguese&mdash;Spanish combination
they usually attacked one another at sight. Now an armed conflict
between the Dutch and the English was imminent. The most forceful
personality who had ever come to the Indies was now
Governor-General--Jan Pieterszoon Coen--and, spread all over the
waters of the island groups, the Dutch had the strongest force of
armed merchantmen in the Indies. At Jacatra, east of Bantam, the
English and the Dutch had built batteries facing one another, and
their vessels were skirmishing, with occasional shooting
matches.</p>

<p>Governor-General Coen, outnumbered at Jacatra, went off to the
Moluccas for reinforcements. Jansz, with his wide experience and
his acknowledged seamanship, was an invaluable man at this stage.
On March 23, 1619, he was made a member of the Council of the
Indies; Pieter de Carpentier,. subsequently Governor-General, and
after whom the Gulf of Carpentaria was named, was made a member
of 'the Council at the same time. Coen returned to Java with a
fleet which included Jansz, and on May 23 attacked Japara, which,
though well fortified, was captured and burnt. Coen then sailed
west to Jacatra with sixteen vessels and 1200 men, and on May 30,
1619,. relieved the fort and captured the town. Upon its ruins
Coen established Batavia and Dutch dominion in the East
Indies.</p>

<h3><a name="ch27">JANSZ CAPTURES FOUR ENGLISH SHIPS.</a></h3>

<p>Jansz, who took part in these operations, was then sent with
six ships to the west coast of Sumatra, and on October 11 fell in
with four English ships--the <i>Dragon</i>, the <i>Beer</i>, the
<i>Expedition</i>, and the <i>Rose</i>. The English were taken
completely by surprise. They had been busily engaged loading
cargo; the men were tired out, and bags of pepper cluttered up
their guns. Jansz laid two of his ships against the English
flagship, and took it after a brief but fierce conflict, in which
thirty Englishmen were killed and Captain Bonner mortally
wounded. Finding resistance useless, the other three ships were
surrendered. Jansz returned the <i>Rose</i> to enable his
prisoners "to go elsewhere," and, with his three prizes, returned
to Batavia. For this exploit the Council, on December 20, 1619,
presented him with a gold chain worth 1000 guilders.<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>Three months later, instructions were received from Europe
that a treaty had been arranged between the English and the
Dutch, under which a joint governing Council was to be formed, an
Anglo-Dutch fleet of twenty sail was to be provided for mutual
defence (and offence), and arrangements made for a division of
the trade.</p>

<blockquote>[1) <i>Purchas His Pilgrimes</i> (1625), Vol. I., pp.
639 and 661-2, gives accounts of this action, in which Jansz is
described as "William Johnson, Commander of the Dutch Fleet,"
and, at p. 641, Captain Pring records a meeting with "Master
Johnson."]</blockquote>

<p>Coen was furious. He wrote sarcastically to his Council in the
Netherlands: "The British have voluntarily retired from the
Indies and you have been so kind as to open the door to them
again." Nevertheless, he obeyed his commands, but privately
resolved that he would pursue the course that suited his own
policy.</p>

<h3><a name="ch28">ADMIRAL WILLEM JANSZ.</a></h3>

<p>On May 28, 1620, the combined Council sent a fleet of ten
ships to Manila and Japan "to protect the trade and do harm to
the enemy." Under the treaty, the English were to fly the flag at
the mainmast and the Dutch at the foremast. This further
infuriated Coen. He wrote to his Directors:--</p>

<p>"The English have appointed a captain named Robert Adams as
commander of their five ships and as Admiral of the fleet; we
have appointed as commander of our five ships and as
Vice-Admiral, the Honourable Willem Janssen, Councillor of India;
it follows that the lesser shall command the greater, which is
not right."</p>

<p>However, Jansz received these instructions:--</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is commanded to keep good friendship and
agreement with the English nation and to help them (should anyone
be in need) to the utmost of your power."<b style=
"color:#0000FF">[1]</b></p>

<p>The expedition was scarcely a success. It blockaded Manila and
took a few ships, but the Dutch share of the booty was only
63,817 guilders. The combined Council, however, decided on a
second expedition. This time, Willem Jansz went as Admiral and
Robert Adams as Vice-Admiral. The news came to the ships at
Firando (Japan), where Jansz was installed with naval honours on
August 19, 1621. Manila was again blockaded in December. From
then until June, 1622, the campaign continued against every ship
that was not English or Dutch, so that when they counted up the
spoils in July the Dutch share was 262,912 guilders, a much
better result than the first.</p>

<p>The English were unwilling to engage in a third expedition,
and Jansz was thus left in full control of his fleet. By the end
of 1622 he was back in Batavia, taking</p>

Netherlands East Indies</i>, Vol. I., p. 228.]</blockquote>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 50}</u></p>

<p>his seat again on the Council of the Indies. His engagement
was extended for another three years at 250 guilders per
month.</p>

<h3><a name="ch29">GOVERNOR OF BANDA.</a></h3>

<p>In October, 1623, Jansz was appointed Governor of Banda,
where, on December 11, he was installed by public proclamation.
He was to remain there for three and a half years. His duty was
to promote agriculture, to place the schools and church on a good
footing, to uphold the law, and to put an end to the disorder
into which some of his predecessors had allowed the
administration to drift. The lands were divided into plots and
given to people in areas sufficient for the support of a given
number of souls after the manner of loans--evidently a form of
leasehold. The church council was able to write with appreciation
of Jansz's administration, stating that the church services had
progressed, especially with the schools, "which on our
recommendation have been improved steadily and diligently over
the islands, so that with time considerable good is to be
expected from them."</p>

<h3><a name="ch30">LOTTERIES FOR SCHOOLS, 1625.</a></h3>

<p>In order to increase the interest in the schools and to gain
the necessary funds, Jansz made use of the lotteries so much in
vogue even in those days. In his Journal he wrote on May 8,
1625:--</p>

<p>"Began to give out the lottery, which is set up for the
schools in the Banda Islands, in which a soldier of Denner named
Guillaume Commeville gained the highest prize (being a golden
cup)."</p>

<p>There was a shortage of labour--most of the original Bandanese
having been wiped out when Coen conquered the islands--and
Chinese, as well as Malayans, were brought in to work the
plantations. The Governor encouraged the free people to trade
with the Kei and Aru islanders after the slaves from those
islands had returned.</p>

<p>The life on land, however, was beginning to pall. Jansz made
several requests to be relieved, and at last a successor, Dr
Pieter Vlack, was appointed, and Jansz returned to Batavia on
June 23, 1627.</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 51}</u></p>

<h3><a name="ch31">JANSZ COMMANDS "GULDEN ZEEPAERT."</a></h3>

<p>Within two months he was on the high seas again, as Admiral of
a fleet of eight armed ships, bound for the coasts of India.
This was a diplomatic mission to enable Commissioner van der Lee
to establish good relations with the Indian Rajahs.</p>

<p>One of Jansz's vessels was the Gulden Zeepaert, which had
arrived at Batavia on April 10 after having sailed along the
southern coast of Australia for over 1000 miles beyond Cape
Leeuwin. The skipper was then Francis Thyssens, and he had on
board the Honourable Pieter Nuyts; hence we get the names of the
Islands St Francis and St Peter at the eastern end of the Great
Australian Bight, and Nuyt's Land on the older maps. The Gerritsz
chart, 1618-1628, states that the discovery was made on January
26, 1627--Australian Anniversary Day, it will be noticed!</p>

<p>Jansz was absent on the voyage to India from August, 1627, to
June, 1628.</p>

<h3><a name="ch32">WILLEM JANSZ GOES HOME.</a></h3>

<p>Two months later the Sultan of Mataram, who "cherished a
design to snatch Batavia from the Dutch, conquer Bantam, and
become Lord of all Java," secretly prepared to take the town.
Here, Jansz played his part in organizing defences; "he stood by
Coen with counsel and deed." But the time had come for him to
retire--he was getting old--and as some ships were ready for
sailing, he decided to go home.</p>

<p>On December 3, 1628, Governor-General Coen gave a banquet to
which all the principal officers were invited, and Jansz, with
two other Councillors, Le. Febvre and van Gorcum, said farewell
to the Indies.</p>

<p>Next day he hoisted his Admiral's flag, raised the anchor, and
late in the afternoon sailed out of the roadstead of Batavia with
the land wind.</p>

<p>On July 16, 1629, Admiral Willem Jansz went to The Hague to
report on the state of the Indies to the States General, the
Army, and to His Princely Excellency; and, that duty done, ended
his long career with the United East India Company.</p>

<p>Of Jansz nothing further is known. We know nothing of his
beginning; we know nothing of his end. We know only that he was a
gallant seaman who served his country and his company with honour
and success for over thirty years; that he rose from the position
of steersman of a vessel to. the Admiralship of the Fleet; that
he was Commander of Solor, and Governor of Banda, at that time
one of the most important colonial possessions of the
Netherlands; that he was a brave enemy when it was his duty to
fight against us, and an honourable friend when he fought on our
side; that he was a member of the Council of the Indies; that he
twice visited and landed on the shores of Australia, and,
retiring after a life full of activity and achievement, died
before it could be realized that he was the first man to discover
an island-continent which slumbered peacefully in the southern
seas for another 164 years until Captain Cook found its eastern
coast and added it to the possessions of the British Crown.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

<p>(1) A Dutch Ship of the <i>Duyfken</i> Type and Time.--This
drawing is from Henry B. Culver's <i>The Book of Old Ship</i>s
(New York, 1924), and represents the <i>Halve Maen</i>, in which
Henry Hudson, an English navigator in the service of the Dutch,
sailed up the Hudson River (New York State) in 1609. The <i>Halve
Maen</i> was a Dutch "yacht" of the same type and size as the
<i>Duyfken</i>, carried the same number of men, and was afloat at
the same period. A full-sized replica of this vessel was
presented by the Dutch people to New York on the occasion of the
300th anniversary of Hudson's discovery. There is no authentic
picture of the <i>Duyfken</i> available, but contemporary prints
give a good idea of the appearance of the vessel.</p>

<p>(2) The Four Vessels of the Dutch 'First Fleet.--This
illustration was reprinted in <i>De Eerst Schipvaart</i>, Vol.
II. (Linschoten-Vereeniging, The Hague, 1925), from an engraving
dated 1611.</p>

<p>(3) Hessel Gerritsz's Map of the Pacific, 1622.--This map of
the Pacific Ocean, the south-western section of which is here
reproduced, is the first map to show any part of Australia, being
that portion of Cape York Peninsula discovered by the
<i>Duyfken</i> in 1606, described on the map as "Nueva Guinea."
It also shows a space between Australia and New Guinea, though
the Dutch at that time were not certain that Torres Strait
existed. The illustration is from the Mitchell Library coloured
facsimile of the original, which is in the Depot des Cartes de la
Marine, Paris.</p>

<p>(4) The Duyfken Chart.--This is from the copy in Dr. F. C.
Wieder's <i>Monumenta Cartographica</i> (The Hague, 1933).</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000"><u>{Page 54}</u></p>

<p>(5) The course of the <i>Duyfken</i> applied to a modern
map.--The course of the <i>Duyfken</i> on the voyage of discovery
to and from Australia and Banda is here applied to a map of the
Indian Ocean from the National Geographic Magazine (Washington,
D.C.). Some emendations have been made for the sake of
clarity.</p>

<p>(6) Letter of Willem Jansz, 1618.--This letter is in the
National Archives at The Hague. (Mitchell Library photostat.)</p>

<p>(7) Gerritsz's Map of Western Australia, 1618-1628.--This
shows the western and southern coasts of Australia accidentally
discovered by the Dutch when sailing from the Cape of Good Hope
to Java between 1616 and 1628. It does not include the
discoveries in the Gulf of Carpentaria by the <i>Duyfken</i>
(1606) and the <i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i> (1623). Willem's
River, the location of the second landfall of Willem Jansz on the
coast of Australia, appears on the map between Eendracht Land
(1616) and De Witt's Land (1628). The illustration is from the
reproduction in J. E. Heeres' <i>Part Borne by the Dutch in the
Discovery of Australia</i>.</p>

<p>(8) The Carpentaria Coastline.--Three illustrations of the
portion of the western coastline of the Cape York Peninsula
discovered by the <i>Duyfken</i> as shown on (a) the Queensland
State Map, No. 2b, 1931; (b) the <i>Duyfken</i> chart; and (c)
Swart's copy of Tasman's map.</p>

<p>NOTE.--Tasman did not make a close examination of the coast
visited previously by the <i>Duyfken</i>, the <i>Pera</i> and the
<i>Arnhem</i>, but placed on his map, somewhat indiscriminately,
the names given to the coast after the voyages of those vessels.
The Revier Carpentier was mentioned 'in the <i>Pera's</i>
Journal, but was altered to De revier Batavia on the
<i>Pera's</i> chart; on Tasman's map, it appears to be a river
flowing into Vliege (Albatross) Bay--an obvious misplacement.</p>

<p>All illustrations are from the collection in the Mitchell
Library, Sydney, with the exception of the drawing of the ship of
the <i>Duyfken</i> type, which is from Culver's book in the
