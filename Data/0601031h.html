<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">I. &mdash; LIVING DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE eternal noonday sun of Pellucidar looked
down upon such a scene as the outer crust of earth may not have
witnessed for countless ages past, such a scene as only the inner
world of the earth's core may produce today.</p>

<p>Hundreds of saber-toothed tigers were driving countless
herbivorous animals into a clearing in a giant forest; and two
white men from the outer crust were there to see, two white men
and a handful of black warriors from far distant Africa.</p>

<p>The men had come in a giant dirigible with others of their
kind through the north polar opening at the top of the world at
the urgent behest of Jason Gridley, but that is a story that has
been once told.</p>

<p>This is the story of the one who was lost.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible," exclaimed Gridley, "that five
hundred miles below our feet automobiles are dashing through
crowded streets lined by enormous buildings; that there the
telegraph, the telephone, and the radio are so commonplace as to
excite no comment; that countless thousands live out their entire
lives without ever having to use a weapon in self-defense, and
yet at the same instant we stand here facing saber-toothed tigers
in surroundings that may not have existed upon the outer crust
since a million years."</p>

<p>"Look at them!" exclaimed von Horst. "Look at what they've
driven into this clearing already, and more coming."</p>

<p>There were great ox-like creatures with shaggy coats and wide-
spreading horns. There were red deer and sloths of gigantic size.
There were mastodons and mammoths, and a huge, elephantine
creature that resembled an elephant and yet did not seem to be an
elephant at all. Its great head was four feet long and three feet
broad. It had a short, powerful trunk and from its lower jaw
mighty tusks curved downward, their points bending inward toward
the body. At the shoulder it stood at least ten feet above the
ground, and in length it must have been fully twenty feet. But
what resemblance it bore to an elephant was lessened by its
small, pig-like ears.</p>

<p>The two white men, momentarily forgetting the tigers behind
them in their amazement at the sight ahead, halted and looked
with wonder upon the huge gathering of creatures within the
clearing. But it soon became apparent that if they were to escape
with their lives they must reach the safety of the trees before
they were either dragged down by the saber-tooths or trampled to
death by the frightened herbivores which were already milling
around looking for an avenue of escape.</p>

<p>"There is still one opening ahead of us, bwana," said Muviro,
the black chief of the Waziri.</p>

<p>"We shall have to run for it," said Gridley. "The beasts are
all headed in our direction now. Give them a volley, and then
beat it for the trees. If they charge, it will be every man for
himself."</p>

<p>The volley turned them back for an instant; but when they saw
the great cats behind them, they wheeled about once more in the
direction of the men.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried von Horst. Then the men broke into a
run as they sought to reach the trees that offered the only
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Gridley was bowled over by a huge sloth; then he scrambled to
his feet just in time to leap from the path of a fleeing mastodon
and reach a tree just as the main body of the stampeding herd
closed about it. A moment later, temporarily safe among the
branches, he looked about for his companions; but none was in
sight, nor could any living thing so puny as man have remained
alive beneath that solid mass of leaping, plunging, terrified
beasts. Some of his fellows, he felt sure, might have reached the
forest in safety; but he feared for von Horst, who had been some
little distance in rear of the Waziri. But Lieutenant Wilhelm von
Horst had escaped. In fact, he had succeeded in running some
little distance into the forest without having to take to the
trees. He had borne off to the right away from the escaping
animals, which had veered to the left after they entered the
forest. He could hear them thundering away in the distance,
squealing and trumpeting, grunting and bellowing.</p>

<p>Winded and almost exhausted, he sat down at the foot of a tree
to catch his breath and rest. He was very tired and just for a
moment he closed his eyes. The sun was directly overhead. When he
opened his eyes again the sun was still directly overhead. He
realized that he had dozed, but he thought that it had been for
but an instant. He did not know that he had slept for a long
time. How long, who may say? For how may time be measured in this
timeless world whose stationary sun hangs eternally motionless at
zenith?</p>

<p>The forest was strangely silent. No longer did he hear the
trumpeting and squealing of the herbivores or the growls and
snarls of the cats. He called aloud to attract the attention of
his friends, but there was no response; then he set out in search
of them, taking what he thought was a direct route back toward
the main camp where the dirigible was moored and toward which he
knew they would be sure to go. But instead of going north, as he
should have done, he went west.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well that he did, for presently he
heard voices. He stopped and listened. Men were approaching. He
heard them distinctly, but he could not recognize their language.
They might be friendly; but, in this savage world, he doubted it.
He stepped from the trail he had been following and concealed
himself behind a clump of bushes, and a moment later the men that
he had heard came into view. They were Muviro and his warriors.
They were speaking the dialect of their own African tribe. At
sight of them von Horst stepped into the trail. They were as glad
to see him as he was to see them. Now if they could but find
Gridley they would be happy; but they did not find him, though
they searched for a long time.</p>

<p>Muviro knew no better than von Horst where they were or the
direction of camp; and he and his warriors were much chagrined to
think that they, the Waziri, could be lost in any forest. As they
compared notes it seemed evident that each had made a large
circle in opposite directions after they had separated. Only thus
could they account for their coming together face to face as they
had, since each insisted that he had not at any time retraced his
steps.</p>

<p>The Waziri had not slept, and they were very tired. Von Horst,
on the contrary had slept and was rested; so, when they found a
cave that would give them all shelter, the Waziri went in where
it was dark and slept while von Horst sat on the ground at the
mouth of the cave and tried to plan for the future. As he sat
there quietly a large boar passed; and, knowing that they would
require meat, the man rose and stalked it. It had disappeared
around a curve in the trail; but though he thought that he was
close behind it he never seemed to be able to catch sight of it
again, and there was such a patchwork of trails crossing and
crisscrossing that he was soon confused and started back toward
the cave.</p>

<p>He had walked a considerable distance before he realized that
he was lost. He called Muviro's name aloud, but there was no
response; then he stopped and tried very carefully to figure out
in what direction the cave must be. He looked up at the sun
mechanically, as though it might help him. It hung at zenith. How
could he plot a course where there were no stars but only a sun
that hung perpetually straight above one's head? He swore under
his breath and set out again. He could only do his best.</p>

<p>For what seemed a very long time he plodded on, but it was
still noon. Often, mechanically, he glanced up at the sun, the
sun that gave him no bearings nor any hint of the lapse of time,
until he came to hate the shining orb that seemed to mock him.
The forest and the jungle teemed with life. Fruits and flowers
and nuts grew in profusion. He never need lack for a variety of
food if he but knew which he might safely eat and which he might
not. He was very hungry and thirsty, and it was the latter that
worried him most. He had a pistol and plenty of ammunition. In
this lush game country he could always provide himself with meat,
but he must have water. He pushed on. It was water that he was
looking for now more than for his companions or for camp. He
commenced to suffer from thirst, and he became very tired again
and sleepy. He shot a large rodent and drank its blood; then he
made a fire and cooked the carcass. It was only half cooked
beneath the surface which was charred in places. Lieutenant
Wilhelm von Horst was a man accustomed to excellent food properly
prepared and served, but he tore at the carcass of his unsavory
kill like a famished wolf and thought that no meal had ever
tasted more delicious. He did not know how long he had been
without food. Now he slept again, this time in a tree; for he had
caught a glimpse of a great beast through the foliage of the
jungle, a beast with enormous fangs and blazing eyes.</p>

<p>Again, when he awoke, he did not know how long he had slept;
but the fact that he was entirely rested suggested that it had
been a long time. He felt that it was entirely possible in a
world where there was no time that a man might sleep a day or a
week. How was one to know? The thought intrigued him. He
commenced to wonder how long he had been away from the dirigible.
Only the fact that he had not quenched his thirst since he had
been separated from his comrades suggested that it could not have
been but a day or two, though now he was actually suffering for
water. It was all that he could think of. He started off in
search of it. He must have water! If he didn't he would
die&mdash;die here alone in this terrible forest, his last
resting place forever unknown to any human being. Von Horst was a
social animal; and, as such, this idea was repugnant to him. He
was not afraid to die; but this seemed such an entirely futile
end&mdash;and he was very young, still in his twenties.</p>

<p>He was following a game trail. There were many of them; they
crossed and crisscrossed all through the forest. Some of them
must lead to water; but which one? He had chosen the one he was
following because it was broader and more plainly marked than the
others. Many beasts had passed along it and, perhaps, for an
incalculable time, for it was worn deep; and von Horst reasoned
that more animals would follow a trail that led to water than
would follow any other trail. He was right. When he came to a
little river, he gave a cry of delight and ran to it and threw
himself face down upon the bank. He drank in great gulps. Perhaps
it should have harmed him, but it did not. It was a clean little
river that ran among boulders over a gravelly bottom, a gem of a
river that carried on its bosom to the forest and the lowlands
the freshness and the coolness and the beauty of the mountains
that gave it birth. Von Horst buried his face in the water, he
let it purl over his bare arms, he cupped his hands and dipped it
up and poured it over his head, he reveled in it. He felt that he
had never known a luxury so rare, so desirable. His troubles
vanished. Everything would be all right now&mdash;he had water!
Now he was safe!</p>

<p>He looked up. Upon the opposite bank of the little river
squatted such a creature as was never in any book, the bones of
which were never in any museum. It resembled a gigantic winged
kangaroo with the head of a reptile, pterodactyl-like in its
long, heavily fanged jaws. It was watching von Horst intently,
its cold, reptilian, lidless eyes staring at him
expressionlessly. There was something terribly menacing in its
fixed gaze. The man started to rise slowly; then the hideous
thing came to sudden life. With a hissing scream it cleared the
little river in a single mighty bound. Von Horst turned to run,
meanwhile tugging at the pistol in his holster; but before he
could draw it, before he could escape, the thing pounced upon him
and bore him to earth; then it picked him up in claw-like hands
and held him out and surveyed him. Sitting erect upon its broad
tail it towered fifteen feet in height, and at close range its
jaws seemed almost large enough to engulf the puny man-thing that
gazed in awe upon them. Von Horst thought that his end had come.
He was helpless in the powerful grip of those mighty talons,
beneath one of which his pistol hand was pinned to his side. The
creature seemed to be gloating over him, debating, apparently,
where to take the first bite; or at least so it seemed to von
Horst.</p>

<p>At the point where the stream crossed the trail there was an
opening in the leafy canopy of the forest, through which the
eternal noonday sun cast its brilliant rays upon the rippling
water, the green sward, the monstrous creature, and its
relatively puny captive. The reptile, if such it were, turned its
cold eyes upward toward the opening; then it leaped high into the
air, and as it did so it spread its wings and flapped dismally
upward.</p>

<p>Von Horst was cold with apprehension. He recalled stories he
had read of some great bird of the outer crust that carried its
prey aloft and then killed it by letting it fall to the ground.
He wondered if this were to be his fate, and he thanked his Maker
that there would be so few to mourn him&mdash;no wife nor
children to be left without protector and provider, no sweetheart
to mourn his loss, pining for the lover who would never
return.</p>

<p>They were above the forest now. The strange, horizonless
landscape stretched away in all directions, fading gradually into
nothingness as it passed from the range of human vision. Beyond
the forest, in the direction of the creature's flight, lay open
country, rolling hills, and mountains. Von Horst could see rivers
and lakes and, in the far, hazy distance, what appeared to be a
great body of water&mdash;an inland sea, perhaps, or a vast,
uncharted ocean; but in whatever direction he might look lay
mystery.</p>

<p>His situation was not one that rendered the contemplation of
scenery a factor of vital interest, but presently whatever
interest he had in it was definitely wiped out. The thing that
carried him suddenly relinquished its hold with one paw. Von
Horst thought that it was going to drop him, that the end had
come. He breathed a little prayer. The creature raised him a few
feet and then lowered him into a dark, odorous pocket which it
held open with its other paw. When it released its hold upon him,
von Horst was in utter darkness. For an instant he was at a loss
to explain his situation; then it dawned upon him that he was in
the belly pouch of a marsupial. It was hot and stifling. He
thought he would suffocate, and the reptilian stench was almost
overpowering. When he could endure it no longer he pushed himself
upward until his head protruded from the mouth of the pouch.</p>

<p>The creature was flying horizontally by now, and the man's
view was restricted to what lay almost directly beneath. They
were still over the forest. The foliage, lying like billowed
clouds of emerald, looked soft and inviting. Von Horst wondered
why he was being carried away alive and whither. Doubtless to
some nest or lair to serve as food, perhaps for a brood of
hideous young. He fingered his pistol. How easy it would be to
fire into that hot, pulsing body; but what would it profit him?
It would mean almost certain death&mdash;possibly a lingering
death if he were not instantly killed, for the only alternative
to that would be fatal injuries. He abandoned the thought.</p>

<p>The creature was flying at surprising speed, considering its
size. The forest passed from view; and they sped out over a tree-
dotted plain where the man saw countless animals grazing or
resting. There were great red deer, sloths, enormous primitive
cattle with shaggy coats; and near clumps of bamboo that bordered
a river was a herd of mammoths. There were other animals, too,
that von Horst was unable to classify. Presently they flew above
low hills, leaving the plain behind, and then over a rough,
volcanic country of barren, black, cone-shaped hills. Between the
cones and part way up their sides rioted the inevitable tropical
verdure of Pellucidar. Only where no root could find a foothold
was there no growth. One peculiar feature of these cones
attracted von Horst's attention; there was an opening in the top
of many of them, giving them the appearance of miniature extinct
volcanoes. They ranged in size from a hundred feet to several
hundred in height. As he was contemplating them, his captor
commenced to circle directly above one of the larger cones; then
it dropped rapidly directly into the yawning crater, alighting on
the floor in the shaft of light from the sun hanging perpetually
at zenith.</p>

<p>As the creature dragged him from its pouch, von Horst could,
at first, see little of the interior of the crater; but as his
eyes quickly became accustomed to the surrounding gloom he saw
what appeared to be the dead bodies of many animals and men laid
in a great circle around the periphery of the hollow cone, their
heads outward from the center. The circle was not entirely
completed, there being a single gap of several yards. Between the
heads of the bodies and the wall of the cone was stacked a
quantity of ivory colored spheres about two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>These things von Horst observed in a brief glance; then he was
interrupted by being lifted into the air. The creature raised
him, faced out, until his head was about on a level with its own;
then the man felt a sharp, sickening pain in the back of his neck
at the base of the brain. There was just an instant of pain and
momentary nausea; then a sudden fading of all feeling. It was as
though he had died from the neck down. Now he was aware of being
carried toward the wall of the cone and of being deposited upon
the floor. He could still see; and when he tried to turn his
head, he found that he could do so. He watched the creature that
had brought him here leap into the air, spread its wings, and
flap dismally away through the mouth of the crater.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">II. &mdash; THE PIT OF
HORROR</a></h2>

<p class="first">As von Horst, lying there in that gloomy cavern
of death, contemplated his situation, he wished that he had died
when he had had the opportunity and the power for self-
destruction. Now he was helpless. The horror of his situation
grew on him until he feared that he should go mad. He tried to
move a hand, but it was as though he had no hands. He could not
feel them, nor any other part of his body below his neck. He
seemed just a head lying in the dirt, conscious but helpless. He
rolled his head to one side. He had been placed at the end of the
row of bodies at one side of the gap that had been left in the
circle. Across the gap from him lay the body of a man. He turned
his head in the other direction and saw that he was lying close
to the body of another man; then his attention was attracted by a
cracking and pounding in the opposite direction. Again he rolled
his head so that he could see what lived in this hall of the
dead. His eyes were attracted to one of the ivory colored spheres
that lay almost directly behind the body at the far side of the
gap. The sphere was jerking to and fro. The sounds seemed to be
coming from its interior. They became louder, more insistent. The
sphere bobbed and rolled about; then a crack appeared in it, a
jagged hole was torn in its surface, and a head protruded. It was
a miniature of the hideous head of the creature that had brought
him here. Now the mystery of the spheres was solved&mdash;they
were the eggs of the great marsupial reptile; but what of the
bodies?</p>

<p>Von Horst, fascinated, watched the terrible little creature
burst its way from its egg. At last, successful, it rolled out
upon the floor of the crater, where it lay inert for some time,
as though resting after its exertions. Then it commenced to move
its limbs, tentatively trying them. Presently it rose to its four
feet; then it sat upright upon its tail and spread its wings. It
flapped them at first weakly, then vigorously for a moment. This
done, it fell upon its discarded shell and devoured it. The shell
gone, it turned without hesitation toward the body of the man at
the far side of the gap. As it approached it, von Horst was
horrified to see the head turn toward the creature, the eyes wide
with terror. With a hissing roar the foul little creature leaped
upon the body, and simultaneously a piercing scream of terror
burst from the lips of the man von Horst had thought was dead.
The horror-filled eyes, the contorted muscles of the face
reflected the mad efforts of the brain to direct the paralyzed
nerve centers, to force them to react to the will to escape. So
obvious was the effort to burst the invisible bonds that held him
that it seemed inevitable that he must succeed, but the paralysis
was too complete to be overcome.</p>

<p>The hideous fledgling fell upon the body and commenced to
devour it; and though the victim may have felt no pain, his
screams and groans continued to reverberate within the hollow
cone of horror until, presently, the other creatures awaiting,
doubtless, a similar fate raised their voices in a blood-curdling
cacophony of terror. Now, for the first time, von Horst realized
that all of these creatures were alive, paralyzed as he was. He
closed his eyes to shut out the gruesome sight, but he could not
close his ears to the abominable, soul-searing din.</p>

<p>Presently he turned his head away from the feeding reptile,
toward the man lying upon his right, and opened his eyes. He saw
that the man had not joined in the frightful chorus and that he
was regarding him through steady, appraising eyes. He was a young
man with a shock of coal-black hair, fine eyes, and regular
features. He had an air about him, an air of strength and quiet
dignity, that attracted von Horst; and he was favorably
impressed, too, because the man had not succumbed to the hysteria
of terror that had seized the other inmates of the chamber. The
young lieutenant smiled at him and nodded. For an instant a faint
expression of surprise tinged the others countenance; then he,
too, smiled. He spoke then, addressing von Horst in a language
that was not understandable to the European.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said von Horst "but I cannot understand you."
Then it was the other's turn to shake his head in denial of
comprehension.</p>

<p>Neither could understand the speech of the other; but they had
smiled at one another, and they had a common bond in their
expectancy of a common fate. Von Horst felt that he was no longer
so much alone, almost that he had found a friend. It made a great
difference, that slender contact of fellowship, even in the
hopelessness of his situation. By comparison with what he had
felt previously he was almost contented.</p>

<p>The next time he looked in the direction of the newly hatched
reptile the body of its victim had been entirely devoured; there
was not even a bone left, and with distended stomach the thing
crawled into the round patch of brilliant sunlight beneath the
crater opening and curled up for sleep.</p>

<p>The victims had relapsed into silence and again lay as though
dead. Time passed; but how much time, von Horst could not even
guess. He felt neither hunger nor thirst, a fact which he
attributed to his paralysis; but occasionally he slept. Once he
was awakened by the flapping of wings, and looked up to see the
foul fledgling fly through the crater opening from the nest of
horror in which it had been hatched.</p>

<p>After awhile the adult came with another victim, an antelope;
and then von Horst saw how he and the other creatures had been
paralyzed. Holding the antelope level with its great mouth, the
reptile pierced the neck at the base of the brain with the
needle-sharp point of its tongue; then it deposited the helpless
creature at von Horst's left.</p>

<p>In this timeless void of living death there was no means of
determining if there was any regularity of recurring events.
Fledglings emerged from their shells, ate them, devoured their
prey (always at the far edge of the gap to von Horst's left),
slept in the sunlight, and flew away, apparently never to return;
the adult came with new victims, paralyzed them, laid them at the
edge of the gap nearest von Horst, and departed. The gap crept
steadily around to the left; and as it crept, von Horst realized
that his inevitable doom was creeping that much nearer.</p>

<p>He and the man at his right occasionally exchanged smiles, and
sometimes each spoke in his own tongue. Just the sound of their
voices expressing thoughts that the other could not understand
was friendly and comforting. Von Horst wished that they might
converse; how many eternities of loneliness it would have
relieved! The same thought must often have been in the mind of
the other, and it was he who first sought to express it and to
overcome the obstacle that separated them from full enjoyment of
their forced companionship. Once, when von Horst turned his eyes
toward him, he said, "Dangar," and tried to indicate himself by
bending his eyes toward himself and inclining his chin toward his
chest. He repeated this several times.</p>

<p>Finally von Horst thought that he grasped his meaning.
"Dangar?" he asked, and nodded toward the other.</p>

<p>The man smiled and nodded and then spoke a word that was
evidently an affirmative in his language. Then von Horst
pronounced his own name several times, indicating himself in the
same way that Dangar had. This was the beginning. After that it
became a game of intense and absorbing interest. They did nothing
else, and neither seemed to tire. Occasionally they slept; but
now, instead of sleeping when the mood happened to seize one of
them, each waited until the other wished to sleep; thus they
could spend all their waking hours in the new and fascinating
occupation of learning how to exchange thoughts.</p>

<p>Dangar was teaching von Horst his language; and since the
latter had already mastered four or five languages of the outer
crust, his aptitude for learning another was greatly increased,
even though there was no similarity between it and any of the
others that he had acquired.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances the procedure would have been
slow or seemingly hopeless; but with the compelling incentive of
companionship and the absence of disturbing elements, other than
when a fledgling hatched and fed, they progressed with amazing
rapidity; or so it seemed to von Horst until he realized that in
this timeless world weeks, months, or even years of outer
terrestrial time might have elapsed since his incarceration.</p>

<p>At last the time arrived when he and Dangar could carry on a
conversation with comparative ease and fluency, but as they had
progressed so had the fateful gap of doom crept around the circle
of the living dead closer and closer to them. Dangar would go
first; then von Horst.</p>

<p>The latter dreaded the former event even more than he did the
latter, for with Dangar gone he would be alone again with nothing
to occupy his time or mind but the inevitable fate that awaited
him as he listened for the cracking of the shell that would
release death in its most horrible form upon him.</p>

<p>At last there were only three victims between Dangar and the
gap. It would not be long now.</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry to leave you," said the Pellucidarian.</p>

<p>"I shall not be alone long," von Horst reminded him.</p>

<p>"No. Well, it is better to die than to remain here far from
one's own country. I wish that we might have lived; then I could
have taken you back to the land of Sari. It is a beautiful land
of hills and trees and fertile valleys; there is much game there,
and not far away is the great Lural Az. I have been there to the
island of Anoroc, where Ja is king.</p>

<p>"You would like Sari. The girls are very beautiful. There is
one there waiting for me now, but I shall never return to her.
She will grieve; but&mdash;" (he sighed) "&mdash;she will get
over it, and another will take her for his mate."</p>

<p>"I should like to go to Sari," said von Horst. Suddenly his
eyes widened in surprise. "Dangar! Dangar!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded the Pellucidarian. "What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"I can feel my fingers! I can move them!" cried von Horst.
"And my toes, too."</p>

<p>"It does not seem possible, Von," exclaimed Dangar
incredulously.</p>

<p>"But it is; it is! Just a little, but I can move them."</p>

<p>"How do you explain it? I cannot feel anything below my
neck."</p>

<p>"The effects of the poison must be wearing off. Perhaps the
paralysis will leave me entirely."</p>

<p>Dangar shook his head. "Since I have been here I have never
seen it leave a victim that the Trodon stung with its poison
tongue. And what if it does? Will you be any better off?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall," replied von Horst slowly. "I have had much
leisure in which to dream and plan and imagine situations since I
have been imprisoned here. I have often dreamed of being released
from this paralysis and what I should do in the event that I
were. I have it all planned out."</p>

<p>"There are only three between you and death," Dangar reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. All depends upon how quickly release
comes."</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, Von, even though, if it comes to you, I
shall not be here to know&mdash;there are only two between me and
the end. The gap is creeping closer."</p>

<p>From that moment von Horst concentrated all his faculties upon
overcoming the paralysis. He felt the glow of life creep
gradually up his limbs, yet still he could move only his
extremities, and these but slightly.</p>

<p>Another Trodon hatched, leaving but one between Dangar and
death; and after Dangar, it would be his turn. As the horrid
creature awoke from its sleep in the sunlight and winged away
through the opening in the peak of the cone, von Horst succeeded
in moving his hands and flexing his wrists; his feet, too, were
free now; but oh, how slow, how hideously slow were his powers
returning. Could Fate be so cruel as to hold out this great hope
and then snatch it from him at the moment of fruition? Cold sweat
broke out upon him as he weighed his chances&mdash;the odds were
so terribly against him.</p>

<p>If only he could measure time that he might know the intervals
of the hatching of the eggs and thus gain an approximate idea of
the time that remained to him. He was quite certain that the eggs
must hatch at reasonably regular intervals, though he could not
actually know. He wore a wrist watch; but it had long since
stopped, nor could he have consulted it in any event, since he
could not raise his arm.</p>

<p>Slowly the paralysis disappeared as far as his knees and
elbows. He could bend these now, and below them his limbs felt
perfectly normal. He knew that if sufficient time were vouchsafed
him he would eventually be in full command of all his muscles
once again.</p>

<p>As he strained to break the invisible bonds that held him
another egg broke, and shortly thereafter Dangar lay with no
creature at his right&mdash;he would be next.</p>

<p>"And after you, Dangar, come I. I think I shall be free before
that, but I wished to save you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," replied the Pellucidarian, "but I am
resigned to death. I prefer it to living on as I now am&mdash;a
head attached to a dead body."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to live like that for long, I'm sure," said
von Horst. "My own experience convinces me that eventually the
effects of the poison must wear off. Ordinarily there is enough
to keep the victim paralyzed long beyond the time that he would
be required to serve as food for the fledglings. If I could only
free myself, I could save you, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Let us talk of other things," said Dangar. "I would not be a
living dead man, and to entertain other hopes can serve but to
tantalize and to make the inevitable end more bitter."</p>

<p>"As you will," said von Horst, with a shrug, "but you can't
keep me from thinking and trying."</p>

<p>And so they talked of Sari and the land of Amoz, from whence
Dian the Beautiful had come, and The Land of Awful Shadow, and
the Unfriendly Islands in the Sojar Az; for von Horst saw that it
pleased Dangar to recall these, to him, pleasant places; though
when the Sarian described the savage beasts and wild men that
roamed them, von Horst felt that as places of residence they left
much to be desired.</p>

<p>As they talked, von Horst discovered that he could move his
shoulders and his hips. A pleasant glow of life suffused his
entire body. He was about to break the news to Dangar when the
fateful sound of breaking shell came simultaneously to the ears
of both men.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my friend," said Dangar. "We of Pellucidar make few
friends outside our own tribes. All other men are enemies to kill
or be killed. I am glad to call you friend. See, the end
comes!"</p>

<p>Already the newly hatched Trodon had gobbled its own shell and
was eyeing Dangar. In a moment it would rush upon him. Von Horst
struggled to rise, but something seemed to hold him yet. Then,
with gaping jaws, the reptile started toward its prey.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">III. &mdash; THE ONLY
HOPE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Once again von Horst struggled to rise; again he
sank back defeated. Perspiration stood out in cold beads over his
entire body. He wanted to curse and scream, but he remained
silent. Silent, too, was Dangar. He did not cry out as had the
others when death crept upon them. It was creeping upon him
now&mdash;closer and closer. Von Horst raised himself to his left
elbow; then he sank back, but as he did so he tried to reach for
the gun at his hip&mdash;the gun he had tried unsuccessfully to
reach before. This time he succeeded. His fingers closed upon the
grip. He dragged the gun from its holster. Again, he partially
raised himself upon an elbow. The Trodon was almost upon Dangar
when von Horst fired. Voicing a piercing scream it leaped high in
air, fluttered its wings futilely for an instant, and then fell
heavily to the floor of the pit&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Dangar looked at von Horst in amazement and in gratitude. "You
have done it," he said; "and I thank you, but what good will it
do. How can we ever escape from this pit? Even if there were a
way I could not take advantage of it&mdash;I who cannot move even
a finger."</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," replied von Horst. "When the
paralysis has left you we shall find a way for that even as I
have for this. But a moment since what would you have given for
your chance of escaping the Trodon? Nothing, absolutely nothing;
yet you are alive and the Trodon is dead. Who are you to say that
the impossible cannot be accomplished?"</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Dangar. "I shall never doubt you
again."</p>

<p>"Now to gain time," exclaimed von Horst. He picked up Dangar,
then, and carried him across the gap and laid him down beside the
last victim that the adult Trodon had brought in. As he lay down
beside him, he remarked, "The next one to hatch will get neither
of us, for it will go to the other side of the gap."</p>

<p>"But what about the old one when it brings in the next
victim?" asked Dangar. "Won't it see that our positions have been
changed? And there is the body of one of its young, too; what do
you suppose it will do about that?"</p>

<p>"I doubt that the Trodon will notice us at all," replied von
Horst, "but if it does, I shall be ready for it. I still have my
pistol and plenty of ammunition; and as for the dead chicken,
I'll dispose of that immediately. I think we can use it."</p>

<p>He rose then and dragged the carcass to one side of the pit,
hiding it behind several eggs. Then he examined it closely,
feeling of its skin. Apparently satisfied, he drew his hunting
knife and fell to work to remove the skin from the carcass.</p>

<p>He worked rapidly but carefully, his whole attention riveted
upon his task, so that it came somewhat in the nature of a
surprise when the sunlight beating in through the mouth of the
crater was momentarily disturbed.</p>

<p>Glancing up, he saw the Trodon returning with another victim;
and instantly he flattened himself prone against the wall of the
pit behind some eggs that he had arranged for this purpose, at
the same time drawing his pistol.</p>

<p>Just the top of his head and his eyes protruded above one of
the eggs, these and the cold, black muzzle of his weapon, as he
watched the unsuspecting reptile deposit its victim beside
Dangar. As he had anticipated, the creature paid no attention to
the Pellucidarian; and a moment later it had vanished through the
opening in search of other prey.</p>

<p>Without further interruption, von Horst completed the skinning
of the fledgling; then he dragged the body to the spot that
Dangar had previously occupied.</p>

<p>The Sarian laughed. "A clever way to dispose of the carcass,"
he said, "if it works."</p>

<p>"I think it will," replied von Horst. "These brainless little
devils are guided by instinct at first. They always go to the
same spot for their first meal, and I'll wager they'll eat
anything they find there."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do with the skin?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. It constitutes the most important part of my
plan for escape. I'll admit that it's a rather hare-brained
scheme; but its the only one that I have been able to formulate,
and it has some chance for success. Now I must go back and get
busy at it again." Von Horst returned to his work; and now he cut
the skin into a continuous strip, starting from the outside. It
took him a long time, and when he had completed the work it was
necessary to trim the rough edges of the outside cut and scrape
the inside surface of the long, flat strap that had resulted from
his labors. While von Horst was measuring the strap by the crude
tip-of-nose-to-tip-of-the-fingers method, his attention was
attracted by the hatching of another Trodon.</p>

<p>"Sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight," counted von Horst as he
watched the fledgling devour the shell of its egg.</p>

<p>"That's over two hundred feet. Should be more than
enough."</p>

<p>The other preliminaries having been gone through, the Trodon
approached the skinned carcass of its brother. Both von Horst and
Dangar watched with interest, as, without an instant's
hesitation, the reptile, fell upon the body and devoured it.</p>

<p>After it had flown away, von Horst crossed over and lay down
beside Dangar. "You were right," admitted the latter, "it never
knew the difference."</p>

<p>"I think they are so low in the scale of intelligence that
they are guided almost exclusively by instinct, even the adults.
That is why the old one did not notice that I was missing and
that you were in a different place. If I am right, my plan will
have a better chance of success.</p>

<p>"Do you feel any different, Dangar? Do you feel any life
returning to your limbs?"</p>

<p>The Sarian shook his head. "No," he replied, rather,
dejectedly. "I'm afraid that will never happen, but I can't
understand how you recovered. That still gives me hope. Can you
explain it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have a theory. You can see that all the
victims of the Trodon are thin-skinned animals. That might
indicate that the needle point of its tongue, by means of which
the poison is injected, can either break only thin skin or can
penetrate only to a shallow depth. While I was skinning the
chicken I took off my leather jacket, and in examining it I
discovered that the tongue of the Trodon ran through two
thicknesses of leather and canvass lining at the back of the
collar before entering my flesh. Look; see the round, green stain
encircling the puncture. Perhaps some of the poison was wiped
off, or perhaps the sting didn't puncture me deeply enough to
have full effect.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I am more than ever convinced that no matter how much
poison a victim receives, short of a lethal dose, he will recover
eventually. You unquestionably received a larger dose than I, but
you have been here longer than I; so it may not be long now
before you will note signs of recovery."</p>

<p>"I am commencing to have hope," replied Dangar.</p>

<p>"Something will have to be done soon," said the other. "Now
that the paralysis has left me and my body is functioning
normally, I am commencing to feel both hunger and thirst. I shall
have to put my plan to the test at the first opportunity before I
become too weak to carry through with it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dangar. "Get out if you can. Don't think of
me."</p>

<p>"I'll take you with me."</p>

<p>"But that will be impossible&mdash;even if you can get out of
this hole yourself, which I doubt."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I shall take you; or I will not go myself."</p>

<p>"No," demurred Dangar. "That would be foolish. I won't permit
it."</p>

<p>"How are you going to prevent it?" laughed von Horst. "Leave
it all to me. The plan may fail anyway. But I'm going to start
putting it into effect at once."</p>

<p>He crossed the pit and took his long strap of reptile hide
from behind the eggs where he had concealed it. Then he made a
running noose in one end. This he spread on the floor at a point
near where the adult Trodon would deposit its next victim.
Carefully he ran the strap to his hiding place behind the eggs,
left a coil there, and then took the remainder to a point beneath
the mouth of the crater but just outside the circle of brilliant
sunlight. Here he neatly coiled most of what remained of the
strap, so that it might pay out smoothly. He took great pains with
this. The remaining loose end he carried to his hiding place;
then he settled himself comfortably to wait.</p>

<p>How long he waited, of course he never knew; but it seemed an
eternity. Hunger and thirst assailed him, as did doubts and fears
of the effectiveness of his plan. He tried not to sleep, for to
sleep now might prove fatal; but he must have dozed.</p>

<p>He awakened with a start to see the great Trodon squatting in
the shaft of sunlight injecting its paralyzing poison into the
neck of a new victim. Von Horst felt suddenly very weak. It had
been a close call. Another moment, perhaps, and it would have
been too late to test his plan. He doubted that he could hold out
until the reptile returned again. Everything, therefore, depended
upon success at the first cast of the die&mdash;his life and
Dangar's. Quickly he gathered his nervous forces under control.
Again he was cool, collected. He loosened his pistol in its
holster and took a new grip on the strap.</p>

<p>The Trodon crossed the pit, bearing the paralyzed victim to
its place in the lethal circle. It placed one great hind paw in
the open noose. Von Horst sent a running wave of the rope across
the floor that lifted the noose up the creature's leg above the
ankle; then he gave a quick jerk. The noose tightened a little.
Was it enough? Would it hold? As he had expected, the creature
paid no attention to the strap. It appeared not to feel it, and
von Horst was quite sure that it did not. So low was its nervous
organization, he believed, that only a sharp blow on the leg
would have carried any sensation to the brain.</p>

<p>After it had deposited the latest victim, the reptile turned
toward the center of the pit, leaped into the air and fluttered
aloft. Von Horst held his breath. Would the noose be shaken
loose? Heaven forbid. It held. Von Horst leaped to his feet and
ran toward the center of the pit, his pistol cocked and ready in
his hand; and as the Trodon rose through the mouth of the crater
and cleared the top of the hill, the man fired three shots in
rapid succession.</p>

<p>He did not need the horrid screams of the wounded creature to
tell him that his aim had been true, for he saw the great reptile
careen in air and plunge from sight beyond the rim of the crater;
then von Horst leaped for the end of the strap, seized it, braced
himself, and waited.</p>

<p>There was danger that the body of the creature, tumbling down
the steep side of the cone-shaped hill, might not come to rest
before it jerked the strap from his hands; so he quickly wound it
around his body and hurriedly made it fast. He might be killed;
but he wouldn't loose his strap or jeopardize his last chance of
escape from the pit. For a moment the strap played out rapidly
from the coil; then it stopped. Either the body of the Trodon had
come to rest or the noose had slipped from the hind leg.
Which?</p>

<p>Von Horst pulled on the strap fearfully. Soon it tautened;
then he knew that it was still attached to the creature. A vague
doubt assailed him as to whether the Trodon had been killed or
not. He knew how tenacious of life such creatures might be.
Suppose it were not dead? What dire possibilities such an event
might entail!</p>

<p>The man tugged on the strap. It did not give. Then he swung on
it with all his weight. It remained as before. Still, clinging to
the loose end, he crossed the pit to Dangar, who was gazing at
him wide-eyed with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You should have been a Sarian." said Dangar with
admiration.</p>

<p>Von Horst smiled. "Come," he said. "Now for you." He stooped
and lifted the Pellucidarian from the ground and carried him to
the center of the pit beneath the crater mouth; then he made the
loose end of the strap secure about his body beneath the
arms.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Dangar.</p>

<p>"Just now I am going to make the inner world a little safer
for thin-skinned animals," replied von Horst.</p>

<p>He went to the side of the pit, commenced breaking the eggs
with the butt of his pistol. In two eggs, those most closely
approaching the end of the period of incubation, be discovered
quite active young. These he destroyed; then he returned to
Dangar.</p>

<p>"I hate to leave these other creatures here," he said,
gesturing toward the unhappy victims; "but there is no other way.
I cannot get them all out."</p>

<p>"You'll still be lucky if you get yourself out." commented
Dangar.</p>

<p>Von Horst grinned. "We'll both be lucky," he replied, "but
this is our lucky day." There was no word for day in the language
of the inner world, where there is neither day nor night; so von
Horst substituted a word from one of the languages of the outer
world. "Be patient and you'll soon be out."</p>

<p>He grasped the strap and started up hand-over-hand. Dangar lay
on his back watching him, renewed admiration shining in his eyes.
It was a long, dangerous climb; but at length von Horst reached
the mouth of the crater. As he topped the summit and looked down,
he saw the carcass of the Trodon lodged on a slight ledge a short
distance beneath him. The creature was quite evidently dead. That
was the only interest that the man had in it; so he turned at
once to his next task, which was to haul Dangar to the mouth of
the crater.</p>

<p>Von Horst was a powerful man; but his strength had already
been tested to its limit and perhaps it had been partially sapped
by the long period of paralysis he had endured. Added to this was
the precarious footing that the steep edge of the crater mouth
afforded; yet he never for a moment lost hope of eventual
success; and though it was slow work, he was finally rewarded by
seeing the inert form of the Pellucidarian lying at the summit of
the hill beside him.</p>

<p>He would have been glad to rest now, but his brief experience
of Pellucidar warned him that this exposed hilltop was no place
to seek sanctuary. He must descend to the bottom, where he could
see a few trees and a little stream of water, take Dangar with
him, and search for a hiding place. The hillside was very steep,
but fortunately it was broken by rudimentary ledges that offered
at least a foothold. In any event, there was no other way to
descend; and so von Horst lifted Dangar across one of his broad
shoulders and started the perilous descent. Slipping and
stumbling, he made his slow way down the steep hillside; and
constantly he kept his eyes alert for danger. Occasionally he
fell, but always managed to catch himself before being
precipitated to the bottom.</p>

<p>He was fairly spent when he finally staggered into the shade
of a clump of trees growing beside the little stream that he had
seen from the summit of the hill. Laying Dangar on the sward, he
slaked his thirst with the clear water of the brook. It was the
second time that he had drunk since he had left the camp where
the great dirigible, O-220, had been moored. How much time had
elapsed he could not even guess; days it must have been, perhaps
weeks or even months; yet for most of that time the peculiar
venom of the Trodon had not only paralyzed him but preserved the
moisture in his body, keeping it always fresh and fit for food
for the unhatched fledgling by which it was destined to be
devoured.</p>

<p>Refreshed and strengthened, he rose and looked about. He must
find a place in which to make a more or less permanent camp, for
it was quite obvious that he could not continue to carry Dangar
in his wanderings. He felt rather helpless, practically alone in
this unknown world. In what direction might he go if he were free
to go? How could he ever hope to locate the O-220 and his
companions in a land where there were no points of compass? when,
even if there had been, he had only a vague idea of the direction
of his previous wanderings and less of the route along which the
Trodon had carried him?</p>

<p>As soon as the effects of the poison should have worn off and
Dangar was free from the bonds of paralysis, he would have not
only an active friend and companion but one who could guide him
to a country where he might be assured of a friendly welcome and
an opportunity to make a place for himself in this savage world,
where, he was inclined to believe, he must spend the rest of his
natural life. It was by far not this consideration alone that
prompted him to remain with the Sarian but, rather, sentiments of
loyalty and friendship.</p>

<p>A careful inspection of the little grove of trees and the area
contiguous to it convinced him that this might be as good a place
as any to make a camp. There was fresh water, and he had seen
that game was plentiful in the vicinity. Fruits and nuts grew
upon several of the trees; and to his question as to their
edibility, Dangar assured him that they were safe.</p>

<p>"You are going to stay here?" asked the Sarian.</p>

<p>"Yes, until you recover from the effects of the poison."</p>

<p>"I may never recover. What then?" Von Horst shrugged.</p>

<p>"Then I shall be here a long while," he laughed.</p>

<p>"I could not expect that even of a brother," objected Dangar.
"You must go in search of your own people."</p>

<p>"I could not find them. If I could, I would not leave you here
alone and helpless."</p>

<p>"You would not have to leave me helpless."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"You would kill me, of course; that would be an act of
mercy."</p>

<p>"Forget it," snapped von Horst. The very idea revolted
him.</p>

<p>"Neither one of us may forget it," insisted Dangar. "After a
reasonable number of sleeps, if I am not recovered, you must
destroy me." He used the only measure of time that he
knew&mdash;sleeps. How much time elapsed between sleeps or how
long each sleep endured, he had no means of telling.</p>

<p>"That is for the future," replied von Horst shortly. "Right
now I'm interested only in the matter of making camp. Have you
any suggestions?"</p>

<p>"There is greatest safety in caves in cliff sides," replied
Dangar. "Holes in the ground are often next best; after that, a
platform or a shelter built among the branches of a tree."</p>

<p>"There are no cliffs here," said von Horst, "nor do I see any
holes in the ground; but there are trees."</p>

<p>"You'd better start building, then," advised the
Pellucidarian, "for there are many flesh eaters in Pellucidar;
and they are always hungry."</p>

<p>With suggestions and advice from Dangar, von Horst constructed
a platform in one of the larger trees, using reeds that resembled
bamboo, which grew in places along the margin of the stream.
These he cut with his hunting knife and lashed into place with a
long, tough grass that Dangar had seen growing in clumps close to
the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>At the latter's suggestion, he added walls and a roof as
further protection against the smaller arboreal carnivora, birds
of prey, and carnivorous flying reptiles.</p>

<p>He never knew how long it took him to complete the shelter;
for the work was absorbing, and time flew rapidly. He ate nuts
and fruit at intervals and drank several times, but until the
place was almost completed he felt no desire to sleep.</p>

<p>It was with considerable difficulty, and not without danger of
falling, that he carried Dangar up the rickety ladder that he had
built to gain access to their primitive abode; but at length he
had him safely deposited on the floor of the little hut; then he
stretched out beside him and was asleep almost instantly.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">IV. &mdash; SKRUF OF
BASTI</a></h2>

<p class="first">When von Horst awoke he was ravenously hungry.
As he raised himself to an elbow, Dangar looked at him and
smiled. "You have had a long sleep," he said, "but you needed
it."</p>

<p>"Was it very long?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"I have slept twice while you slept once," replied Dangar,
"and I am now sleepy again."</p>

<p>"And I am hungry," said von Horst, "ravenously hungry; but I
am sick of nuts and fruit. I want meat; I need it."</p>

<p>"I think you will find plenty of game down stream," said
Dangar. "I noticed a little valley not far below here while you
were carrying me down the hill. There were many animals
there."</p>

<p>Von Horst rose to his feet. "I'll go and get one."</p>

<p>"Be Careful," cautioned the Pellucidarian. "You are a stranger
in this world. You do not know all the animals that are
dangerous. There are some that look quite harmless but are not.
The red deer and the thag will often charge and toss you on their
horns or trample your life out, though they eat no meat. Look out
for the bucks and the bulls of all species and the shes when they
have young. Watch above, always, for birds and reptiles. It is
well to walk where there are trees to give you shelter from these
and a place into which to climb to escape the others."</p>

<p>"At least I am safe from one peril," commented von Horst.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Dangar.</p>

<p>"In Pellucidar, I shall never die of <i>ennui</i>."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean. I do not know what <i>ennui</i>
is."</p>

<p>"No Pellucidarian ever could," laughed von Horst, as he quit
the shelter and descended to the ground.</p>

<p>Following Dangar's suggestion, he followed the stream down
toward the valley that the Sarian had noticed, being careful to
remain as close to trees as possible and keeping always on the
alert for the predatory beasts, birds, and reptiles that are
always preying upon lesser creatures.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he came in sight of the upper end of
the valley and saw a splendid buck antelope standing alone as
though on guard. He offered a splendid shot for a rifle, but the
distance was too great to chance a pistol shot; so von Horst
crept closer, taking advantage of the cover afforded by clumps of
tall grasses, the bamboo-like reeds, and the trees. Cautiously he
wormed his way nearer and nearer to his quarry that he might be
sure to bring it down with the first shot. He still had a full
belt of cartridges, but he knew that when these were gone the
supply could never be replenished&mdash;every one of them must
count.</p>

<p>His whole attention centered upon the buck, he neglected for
the moment to be on the watch for danger. Slowly he crept on
until he reached a point just behind some tall grasses that grew
but a few paces from the still unsuspecting animal. He raised his
pistol to take careful aim, and as he did so a shadow passed
across him. It was but a fleeting shadow, but in the brilliant
glare of the Pellucidarian sun it seemed to have substance. It
was almost as though a hand had been laid upon his shoulder. He
looked up, and as he did so he saw a hideous thing diving like a
bullet out of the blue apparently straight for him&mdash;a mighty
reptile that he subconsciously recognized as a pteranodon of the
Cretaceous. With a roaring hiss, as of a steam locomotive's
exhaust the thing dropped at amazing speed. Mechanically, von
Horst raised his pistol although he knew that nothing short of a
miracle could stop or turn that frightful engine of destruction
before it reached its goal; and then he saw that he was not its
target. It was the buck. The antelope stood for a moment as
though paralyzed by terror; then it sprang away&mdash;but too
late. The pteranodon swooped upon it, seized it in its mighty
talons, and rose again into the air.</p>

<p>Von Horst breathed a sigh of relief as he wiped the
perspiration from his forehead. "What a world!" he muttered,
wondering how man had survived amidst such savage
surroundings.</p>

<p>Farther down the little valley he now saw many animals
grazing. There were deer and antelope and the great, shaggy bos
so long extinct upon the outer crust. Among them were little,
horse-like creatures, no larger than a fox terrier, resembling
the Hyracotherium of the Eocene, early progenitors of the horse,
which but added to the amazing confusion of birds, mammals, and
reptiles of various eras of the evolution of life on the outer
crust.</p>

<p>The sudden attack of the pteranodon upon one of their number
frightened the other animals in the immediate vicinity; and they
were galloping off down the valley, snorting, squealing, and
bucking leaving von Horst to contemplate the flying hoofs of many
a fine dinner. There was nothing to do but follow them if he
would have meat; and so he set off after them, keeping close to
the fringe of trees along the stream which wound along one side
of the valley. But to add to his discomfiture, those that had
initiated the stampede bore down upon the herds grazing below
them, imparting their terror to these others, with the result
that the latter joined them; and in a short time all were out of
sight.</p>

<p>Most of them kept on down the valley, disappearing from the
man's view where the valley turned behind the hills; but he saw a
few large sheep run into a canyon between two nearby cones, and
these he decided to pursue. As he entered the canyon he saw that
it narrowed rapidly, evidently having been formed by the erosion
of water which had uncovered the broken lava rocks of a previous
flow. Only a narrow trail ran between some of the huge blocks,
hundreds of which were scattered about in the wildest
confusion.</p>

<p>The sheep had been running rapidly; and as they had started
considerably ahead of him, he knew that they must be out of
earshot by now; so he made no effort to hide his pursuit, but
moved at a quick walk along the winding trail between the rocks.
He came at last to a point where the trail debouched upon a wider
portion of the canyon and as he was about to enter it he heard
plainly the sound of running feet coming toward him from the
upper portion of the canyon, which he could not see. And then he
heard a disconcerting series of growls and snarls from the same
direction. He had already seen enough of Pellucidar and its
bloodthirsty fauna to take it for granted that practically
everything that had life might be considered a potential menace;
so he leaped quickly behind a large lava rock and waited.</p>

<p>He had scarcely concealed himself, when a man came running
from the upper end of the gorge. It seemed to von Horst that the
newcomer was as fleet as a deer. And it was well for him that he
was fleet, for behind him came the author of the savage snarls
and growls that von Horst had heard&mdash;a great, dog-like beast
as large and savage as a leopard. As fleet as the man was,
however, the beast was gaining on him; and it was apparent to von
Horst that it would overtake its quarry and drag him down before
he had crossed the open space.</p>

<p>The fellow was armed only with a crude stone knife, which he
now carried in one hand, as though determined to make what fight
for his life he might when he could no longer outdistance his
pursuer; but he must have realized, as did von Horst, how futile
his weapon would be against the powerful beast bearing down upon
him.</p>

<p>There was no question in von Horst's mind as to what he should
do. He could not stand idly by and see a human being torn to
pieces by the cruel fangs of the Hyaenodon, and so he stepped
from behind the rock that had concealed him from both the man and
the beast; and, jumping quickly to one side where he might obtain
an unobstructed shot at the creature, raised his pistol, took
careful aim, and fired. It was not a lucky shot; it was a good
shot, perfect. It bored straight through the left side of the
brute's chest and buried itself in his heart. With a howl of pain
and rage, the carnivore bounded forward almost to von Horst; then
it crumpled at his feet, dead.</p>

<p>The man it had been pursuing, winded and almost spent, came to
a halt. He was wide-eyed and trembling as he stood staring at von
Horst in wonder and amazement. As the latter turned toward him he
backed away, gripping his knife more tightly.</p>

<p>"Go away!" he growled. "I kill!" He spoke the same language
that Dangar had taught von Horst, which, he had explained, was
the common language of all Pellucidar; a statement that the man
from the outer crust had doubted possible.</p>

<p>"You kill what?" demanded von Horst.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to kill me?"</p>

<p>"So that I shall not be killed by you."</p>

<p>"Why should I kill you?" asked von Horst. "I just saved your
life. If I had wished you to die, I could have just left you to
that beast."</p>

<p>The man scratched his head.</p>

<p>"That is so," he admitted after some reflection; "but still I
do not understand it. I am not of your tribe; therefore there is
no reason why you should not wish to kill me. I have never seen a
man like you before. All other strangers that I have met have
tried to kill me. Then, too, you cover your body with strange
skins. You must come from a far country."</p>

<p>"I do," von Horst assured him; "but the question now is, are
we to be friends or enemies?" Again the man ran his nails through
his shock of black hair meditatively. "It is very peculiar," he
said. "It is something that I have never before heard of. Why
should we be friends?"</p>

<p>"Why should we be enemies?" countered von Horst. "Neither one
of us has ever harmed the other. I am from a very far country, a
stranger in yours. Were you to come to my country, you would be
treated well. No one would wish to kill you. You would be given
shelter and fed. People would be kindly toward you, just because
they are kindly by nature and not because you could be of any
service to them. Here, it is far more practical that we be
friends; because we are surrounded by dangerous beasts, and two
men can protect themselves better than one.</p>

<p>"However, if you wish to be my enemy, that is up to you. I may
go my way, and you yours; or, if you wish to try to kill me,
that, too, is a matter for you to decide; but do not forget how
easily I killed this beast here. Just as easily could I kill
you."</p>

<p>"Your words are true words," said the man. "We shall be
friends. I am Skruf. Who are you?"</p>

<p>In his conversations with Dangar, von Horst had noticed that
no Pellucidarians that the other had mentioned had more than one
name, to which was sometimes added a descriptive title such as
the Hairy One, the Sly One, the Killer, or the like; and as
Dangar usually called him von, he had come to accept this as the
name he would use in the inner world; so this was the name that
he gave to Skruf.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" asked the man. "This is a bad
country because of the Trodons."</p>

<p>"I have found it so," replied von Horst. "I was brought here
by a Trodon."</p>

<p>The other eyed him skeptically. "You would be dead now if a
Trodon had ever seized you."</p>

<p>"One did, and took me to its nest to feed its young. I and
another man escaped."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Back by the river in our camp. I was hunting for food when I
met you. I was following some sheep up this canyon. What were you
doing here?"</p>

<p>"I was escaping from the Mammoth Men," replied Skruf. "Some of
them captured me. They were taking me back to their country to
make a slave of me, but I escaped from them. They were pursuing
me, but when I reached this canyon I was safe. In places it is
too narrow to admit a mammoth."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I think they have given up the chase and then
return to my own country."</p>

<p>Von Horst suggested that Skruf come to his camp and wait and
that then the three of them could go together as far as their
trails were identical, but first he wished to bag some game.
Skruf offered to help him, and with the latter's knowledge of the
quarry it was not long before they had found the sheep and von
Horst had killed a young buck. Skruf was greatly impressed and
not a little frightened by the report of the pistol and the, to
him, miraculous results that von Horst achieved with it.</p>

<p>After skinning the buck and dividing the weight of the carcass
between them, they set off for camp, which they reached without
serious interruption. Once a bull thag charged them, but they
climbed trees and waited until it had gone away, and another time
a saber-tooth crossed their path; but his belly was full, and he
did not molest them. Thus, through the primitive savagery of
Pellucidar, they made their way to the camp.</p>

<p>Dangar was delighted that von Horst had returned safely, for
he knew the many dangers that beset a hunter in this fierce
world. He was much surprised when he saw Skruf; but when the
circumstances were explained to him he agreed to accept the other
as a friend, though this relationship with a stranger was as
foreign to his code as to Skruf's.</p>

<p>Skruf came from a land called Basti which lay in the same
general direction as Sari, though much closer; so it was decided
that they would travel together to Skruf's country as soon as
Dangar recovered.</p>

<p>Von Horst could not understand how these men knew in what
direction their countries lay when there were no means of
determining the points of the compass, nor could they explain the
phenomenon to him. They merely pointed to their respective
countries, and they pointed in the same general direction. How
far they were from home neither knew; but by comparing notes,
they were able to assume that Sari lay very much farther away
than Basti. What von Horst had not yet discovered was that each
possessed, in common with all other inhabitants of Pellucidar, a
well developed homing instinct identical with that of most birds
and which is particularly apparent in carrier pigeons.</p>

<p>As sleeps came and went and hunting excursions were made
necessary to replenish their larder, Skruf grew more and more
impatient of the delay. He was anxious to return to his own
country, but he realized the greater safety of numbers and
especially that of the protection of von Horst's miraculous
weapon that killed so easily at considerable distances. He often
questioned Dangar in an effort to ascertain if there was any
change in his condition, and he was never at any pains to conceal
his disappointment when the Sarian admitted that he still had no
feeling below his neck.</p>

<p>On one occasion when von Horst and Skruf had gone farther
afield than usual to hunt, the latter broached the subject of his
desire to return to his own country; and the man of the outer
crust learned for the first time the urge that prompted the
other's impatience.</p>

<p>"I have chosen my mate," explained Skruf, "but she demanded
the head of a tarag to prove that I am a brave man and a great
hunter. It was while I was hunting the tarag that the Mammoth Men
captured me. The girl has slept many times since I went away. If
I do not return soon some other warrior may bring the head of a
tarag and place it before the entrance to her cave; then, when I
return, I shall have to find another who will mate with me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to prevent your returning to your own
country whenever you see fit," von Horst assured him.</p>

<p>"Could you kill a tarag with that little thing that makes such
a sharp noise?" inquired Skruf.</p>

<p>"I might." Von Horst was not so certain of this; at least he
was not certain that he could kill one of the mighty tigers
quickly enough to escape death from its formidable fangs and
powerful talons before it succumbed.</p>

<p>"The way we have come today," remarked Skruf, tentatively, "is
in the direction of my country. Let us continue on."</p>

<p>"And leave Dangar?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>Skruf shrugged. "He will never recover. We cannot remain with
him forever. If you will come with me, you can easily kill a
tarag with the thing you call pistol; then I will place it before
the entrance to the girl's cave, and she will think that I killed
it. In return, I will see that the tribe accepts you. They will
not kill you. You may live with us and be a Bastian. You can take
a mate, too; and there are many beautiful girls in Basti."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied von Horst; "but I shall remain with Dangar.
It will not be long now before he recovers. I am sure that the
effects of the poison will disappear as they did in my case. The
reason that they have persisted so much longer is that he must
have received a much larger dose than I."</p>

<p>"If he dies, will you come with me?" demanded Skruf.</p>

<p>Von Horst did not like the expression in the man's eyes as he
asked the question. He had never found Skruf as companionable as
Dangar. His manner was not as frank and open. Now he was vaguely
suspicious of his intentions and his honesty, although he
realized that he had nothing tangible upon which to base such a
judgment and might be doing the man an injustice. However, he
phrased his reply to Skruf's question so that he would be on the
safe side and not be placing a premium on Dangar's life. "If he
lives," he said, "we will both go with you when he recovers."
Then he turned back toward the camp.</p>

<p>Time passed. How much, von Horst could not even guess. He had
attempted to measure it once, keeping his watch wound and
checking off the lapse of days on a notched stick; but where it
is always noon it is not always easy to remember either to wind
or consult a watch. Often he found that it had run down; and
then, of course, he never knew how long it had been stopped
before he discovered that it was not running; nor, when he slept,
did he ever know for how long a time. So presently he became
discouraged; or, rather, he lost interest. What difference did
the duration of time make, anyway? Had not the inhabitants of
Pellucidar evidently existed quite as contentedly without it as
they would have with? Doubtless they had been more contented. As
he recalled his world of the outer crust he realized that time
was a hard task master that had whipped him through life a
veritable slave to clocks, watches, bugles, and whistles.</p>

<p>Skruf often voiced his impatience to be gone, and Dangar urged
them not to consider him but to leave him where he was if they
would not kill him. And so the two men slept or ate or hunted
through the timeless noon of the eternal Pellucidarian day; but
whether it was for hours or for years, von Horst could not
tell.</p>

<p>He tried to accustom himself to all this and to the motionless
sun hanging forever in the exact center of the hollow sphere, the
interior surface of which is Pellucidar and the outer, the world
that we know and that he had always known; but he was too new to
his environment to be able to accept it as did Skruf and Dangar
who never had known aught else.</p>

<p>And then he was suddenly awakened from a sound sleep by the
excited cries of Dangar. "I can move!" exclaimed the Sarian.
"Look! I can move my fingers."</p>

<p>The paralysis receded rapidly, and as Dangar rose unsteadily
to his feet the three men experienced a feeling of elation such
as might condemned men who had just received their reprieves. To
von Horst it was the dawning of a new day, but Dangar and Skruf
knew nothing of dawns. However, they were just as happy.</p>

<p>"And now," cried Skruf, "we start for Basti. Come with me, and
you shall be treated as my brothers. The people will welcome you,
and you shall live in Basti forever."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">V. &mdash; INTO SLAVERY</a></h2>

<p class="first">The route that Skruf took from the country of
the black craters to the land of Basti was bewilderingly
circuitous, since it followed the windings of rivers along the
banks of which grew the trees and thickets that offered the oft
needed sanctuary in this world of constant menace, or led through
gloomy forests, or narrow, rocky gorges. Occasionally,
considerable excursions from the more direct route were
necessitated when periods of sleep were required, for then it
became imperative that hiding places be discovered where the
three might be reasonably safe from attack while they slept. Von
Horst became so confused and bewildered during the early stages
of the long journey that he had not the remotest conception of
even the general direction in which they were traveling, and
often doubted Skruf's ability to find his way back to his own
country; but neither the Bastian nor Dangar appeared to entertain
the slightest misgiving.</p>

<p>Game was plenty&mdash;usually far too plenty and too
menacing&mdash;and von Horst had no difficulty in keeping them
well supplied; but the steady drain upon his store of ammunition
made him apprehensive for the future, and he determined to find
some means of conserving his precious cartridges that he might
have them for occasions of real emergency when his pistol might
mean a matter of life and death to him.</p>

<p>His companions were, culturally, still in the stone age,
having no knowledge of any weapon more advanced than clubs, stone
knives, and stone tipped spears; so, having witnessed the
miraculous ease and comparative safety with which von Horst
brought down even large beasts with his strange weapon, they were
all for letting him do the killing.</p>

<p>For reasons of his own, largely prompted by his suspicions
concerning Skruf's loyalty, von Horst did not wish the others to
know that his weapon would be harmless when his supply of
ammunition was exhausted; and they were too ignorant of all
matters concerning firearms to deduce as much for themselves. It
was necessary, therefore, to find some plausible excuse for
insisting that their hunting be done with other weapons.</p>

<p>Skruf was armed with a knife and a spear when they set out
upon their journey; and as rapidly as he could find the materials
and fashion them, Dangar had fabricated similar weapons for
himself. With his help, von Horst finally achieved a spear; and
shortly thereafter commenced to make a bow and arrows. But long
before they were completed he insisted that they must kill their
game with the primitive weapons they possessed because the report
of the pistol would be certain to attract the attention of
enemies to them. As they were going through a country in which
Skruf assured them they might meet hunting and raiding parties
from hostile tribes, both he and Dangar appreciated the wisdom of
von Horst's suggestion; and thereafter the three lay in wait for
their prey with stone-shod spears.</p>

<p>The ease with which von Horst adapted himself to the primitive
life of his cave-men companions was a source of no little wonder
even to himself. How long a time had elapsed since he left the
outer crust, he could not know; but he was convinced that it
could not have been more than a matter of months; yet in that
time he had sloughed practically the entire veneer of
civilization that it had taken generations to develop, and had
slipped back perhaps a hundred thousand years until he stood upon
a common footing with men of the old stone age. He hunted as they
hunted, ate as they ate, and often found himself thinking in
terms of the stone age.</p>

<p>Gradually his apparel of the civilized outer crust had given
way to that of a long dead era. His boots had gone first. They
had been replaced by sandals of mammoth hide. Little by little
his outer clothing, torn and rotten, fell apart until he no
longer covered his nakedness; then he had been forced to discard
it and adopt the skin loin cloth of his companions. Now, indeed,
except for the belt of cartridges, the hunting knife, and the
pistol, was he a veritable man of the Pleistocene.</p>

<p>With the completion of his bow and a quantity of arrows, he
felt that he had taken a definite step forward. The thought
amused him. Perhaps now he was ten or twenty thousand years more
advanced than his fellows. But he was not to remain so long. As
soon as he had perfected himself in the use of the new weapons,
both Dangar and Skruf were anxious to possess similar ones. They
were as delighted with them as children with new toys; and soon
learned to use them, Dangar, especially, showing marked aptitude.
Yet the pistol still intrigued them. Skruf had constantly
importuned von Horst to permit him to fire it, but the European
would not let him even touch it.</p>

<p>"No one can safely handle it but myself," he explained. "It
might easily kill you if you did."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of it," replied Skruf. "I have watched you
use it. I could do the same. Let me show you."</p>

<p>But von Horst was determined to maintain the ascendancy that
his sole knowledge of the use of the pistol gave him, and it was
later to develop that his decision was a wise one. But the best
corroborating evidence of his assurance to Skruf that the weapon
would be dangerous to anyone but von Horst was furnished by Skruf
himself.</p>

<p>All during the journey Skruf kept referring to his desire to
take home the head of a tarag that he might win the consent of
his lady-love. He was constantly suggesting that von Horst shoot
one of the great brutes for him, until it became evident to both
von Horst and Dangar that the fellow was terrified at the thought
of attempting to kill one by himself. Von Horst had no intention
of tempting fate by seeking an encounter with this savage
monster, a creature of such enormous proportions, great strength,
and awful ferocity that it has been known to drag down and kill a
bull mastodon single-handed.</p>

<p>They had not chanced to cross the path of one of the monsters;
and von Horst was hopeful that they would not, but the law of
chance was against him. No one may blame von Horst for a
disinclination to pit himself against this monster of a bygone
age with the puny weapons that he carried. Even his pistol could
do little more than enrage the creature. Could he reach its heart
with any weapon it would die eventually, but probably not quickly
enough to save him from a terrible mauling and almost certain
death. Yet, of course, there was always a chance that he might
conquer the great brute.</p>

<p>Then it happened, and so suddenly and unexpectedly that there
was no opportunity for preparation. The three men were walking
single file along a forest trail. Von Horst was in the lead,
followed by Skruf. Suddenly, without warning, a tarag leaped from
the underbrush directly in their path not three paces from von
Horst. To the eyes of the European it appeared as large as a
buffalo, and perhaps it was. Certainly it was a monstrous
creature with gaping jaws and flaming eyes.</p>

<p>The instant that it struck the ground in front of the men it
leaped for von Horst. Skruf turned and fled, knocking Dangar down
in his precipitate retreat. Von Horst had not even time to draw
his pistol, so quickly was the thing upon him. He happened to be
carrying his spear in his right hand with the tip forward. He
never knew whether the thing he did was wholly a mechanical
reaction or whether by intent. He dropped to one knee, placed the
butt of the spear on the ground and pointed the head at the
beast's throat; and in the same instant the tarag impaled itself
upon the weapon. Von Horst held his ground; the shaft of the
spear did not break; and notwithstanding all its strength and
size, the beast could not quite reach the man with its
talons.</p>

<p>It screamed and roared and threshed about, tearing at the
spear in an agony of pain and rage; and every instant von Horst
expected that the shaft must break and let the beast fall upon
him. Then Dangar ran in and, braving the dangers of those clawing
talons, thrust his spear into the tarag's side&mdash;not once,
but twice, three times the sharp stone point sank into the heart
and lungs of the great tiger until, with a final scream, it sank
lifeless to the ground. And when it was all over, Skruf descended
from a tree in which he had taken refuge and fell upon the
carcass with his crude knife. He paid no attention to either von
Horst or Dangar as he hacked away until he finally severed the
head. Then he wove a basket of long grasses and strapped the
trophy to his back. All this he did without even a by-your-leave,
nor did he thank the men who had furnished the trophy with which
he hoped to win a mate.</p>

<p>Both von Horst and Dangar were disgusted with him, but perhaps
the European was more amused than angry; however, the remainder
of that march was made in silence, nor did one of them refer to
the subject again in any way, though the stench from the rotting
head waxed more and more unbearable as they proceeded on their
way to the country of the Bastians.</p>

<p>The three men had hidden themselves away in a deserted cave
high in a cliffside to sleep, shortly following the encounter
with the tarag which had occurred after Skruf had made his final
appeal for a chance to show what he could do with a pistol, when
von Horst and Dangar were awakened by a shot. As they leaped to
their feet, they saw Skruf toppling to the floor of the cave as
he hurled the pistol from him. Von Horst rushed to the man's side
where he lay writhing and moaning, but a brief examination
convinced the European that the fellow was more terrified than
hurt. His face was powder marked, and there was a red welt across
one cheek where the bullet had grazed it. Otherwise, the only
damage done was to his nervous system; and that had received a
shock from which it did not soon recover. Von Horst turned away
and picked up his pistol. Slipping it into its holster, he lay
down again to sleep. "The next time it will kill you, Skruf," he
said. That was all. He was confident that the man had learned his
lesson. For some time after the incident in the cave, Skruf was
taciturn and surly; and on several occasions von Horst detected
the man eyeing him with an ugly expression on his dark
countenance; but eventually this mood either passed or was
suppressed, for as they neared Basti he grew almost jovial.</p>

<p>"We'll soon be there," he announced after a long sleep.
"You're going to see a tribe of fine people, and you're going to
be surprised by the reception you'll get. Basti is a fine
country; you'll never leave it."</p>

<p>On that march, they left the low country and the river they
had been following and entered low hills beyond which loomed
mountains of considerable height. Eventually Skruf led them into
a narrow gorge between chalk cliffs. It was a winding gorge along
which they could see but a short distance either ahead or behind.
A little stream of clear water leaped and played in the sunlight
on its way down to some mysterious, distant sea. Waving grasses
grew upon thin topsoil at the summit of the cliffs; and there was
some growth at the edges of the stream where soil, washing down
from above, had lodged&mdash;some flowering shrubs and a few
stunted trees.</p>

<p>Skruf was in the lead. He appeared quite excited, and kept
repeating that they were almost at the village of the Bastians.
"Around the next turn," he said presently, "the lookout will see
us and give the alarm."</p>

<p>The prophesy proved correct, for as they turned a sharp corner
of the cliff upon their left, a voice boomed out from above them
in a warning that reverberated up and down the gorge. "Someone
comes" it shouted, and then to those below him, "Stop! or I kill.
Who are you who come to the land of the Bastians?"</p>

<p>Von Horst looked up to see a man standing upon a ledge cut
from the face of the chalk cliff. Beside him were a number of
large boulders that he could easily shove off onto anyone
beneath.</p>

<p>Skruf looked up at the man and replied, "We are friends. I am
Skruf."</p>

<p>"I know you," said the lookout, "but I do not know the others.
Who are they?"</p>

<p>"I am taking them to Frug, the chief," replied Skruf. "One is
Dangar, who comes from a country he calls Sari; the other comes
from another country very far away."</p>

<p>"Are there more than three?" asked the lookout.</p>

<p>"No," replied Skruf; "there are only three."</p>

<p>"Take them to Frug, the chief," directed the lookout.</p>

<p>The three continued along the gorge, coming at length to a
large, circular basin in the surrounding walls of which von Horst
saw many caves. Before each cave was a ledge, and from one ledge
to the next ladders connected the different levels. Groups of
women and children clustered on the ledges before the mouths of
the caves, staring down at them questioningly, evidently having
been warned by the cry of the lookout. A row of warriors
stretched across the basin between them and the cliffs where the
caves lay. They, too, appeared to have been expecting the party,
and were ready to receive them in whatever guise they appeared,
whether as friends or foes.</p>

<p>"I am Skruf," cried that worthy. "I wish to see Frug. You all
know Skruf."</p>

<p>"Skruf has been gone for many sleeps," replied one. "We
thought he was dead and would come no more."</p>

<p>"But I am Skruf," insisted the man.</p>

<p>"Come forward then, but first throw down your weapons."</p>

<p>They did as they were bid; but Skruf, who was in the lead, did
not observe that von Horst retained his pistol. The three men
advanced, and as they did so they were completely surrounded by
the warriors of Basti who were now pressing forward.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is Skruf," remarked several as they drew nearer; but
there was no cordiality in their tones, no slightest coloring of
friendship. They halted presently before a huge man, a hairy man.
He wore a necklace of the talons of bears and tigers. It was
Frug.</p>

<p>"You are Skruf," he announced. "I see that you are Skruf, but
who are these?"</p>

<p>"They are prisoners," replied Skruf, "that I have brought back
to be slaves to the Basti. I have also brought the head of a
tarag that I killed. I shall place it before the cave of the
woman I would mate with. Now I am a great warrior."</p>

<p>Von Horst and Dangar looked at Skruf in amazement.</p>

<p>"You have lied to us, Skruf," said the Sarian. "We trusted
you. You said that your people would be our friends."</p>

<p>"We are not the friends of our enemies," growled Frug, "and
all men who are not Bastians are our enemies."</p>

<p>"We are not enemies," said von Horst. "We have hunted and
slept with Skruf as friends for many sleeps. Are the men of Basti
all liars and cheats?"</p>

<p>"Skruf is a liar and a cheat," said Frug; "but I did not
promise that I would be your friend, and I am chief. Skruf does
not speak for Frug."</p>

<p>"Let us go our way to my country," said Dangar. "You have no
quarrel with me or my people."</p>

<p>Frug laughed. "I do not quarrel with slaves," he said. "They
work, or I kill them. Take them away and put them to work," he
ordered, addressing the surrounding warriors.</p>

<p>Immediately several Bastians closed in on them and seized
them. Von Horst saw that resistance would be futile. He might
kill several of them before he emptied his pistol; but they would
almost certainly overpower him in the end; or, more probably, run
a half dozen spears through him. Even though they did not, and he
escaped temporarily, the lookout in the gorge below would but
have to topple a couple of boulders from his ledge to finish him
as effectually.</p>

<p>"I guess we're in for it," he remarked to Dangar.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Sarian. "I see now what Skruf meant when he
said that we would be surprised by the reception we got and that
we would never leave Basti."</p>

<p>The guards hustled them to the foot of the cliff and herded
them up ladders to the highest ledge. Here were a number of men
and women working with crude stone instruments chipping and
scraping away at the face of the chalk cliff, scooping out a new
ledge and additional caves. These were the slaves. A Bastian
warrior squatting upon his heels in the shadow of the entrance to
a new cave that was being excavated directed the work. Those who
had brought Dangar and von Horst to the ledge turned them over to
this man.</p>

<p>"Was it Skruf who took these men prisoners?" asked the guard.
"It looked like him from here, but it doesn't seem possible that
such a coward could have done it."</p>

<p>"He tricked them," explained the other. "He told them they
would be received here as friends and be well treated. He brought
back the head of a tarag, too; he is going to put it at the
entrance to the cave where the slave girl, La-ja, sleeps. He
asked Frug for her, and the chief told him he could have her if
he brought back the head of a tarag. Frug thought that was a good
joke&mdash;the same as saying no."</p>

<p>"Men of Basti do not mate with slaves," said the guard.</p>

<p>"They have," the other reminded him; "and Frug has given his
word, and he will keep it&mdash;only I'd have to see Skruf kill a
tarag before I'd believe it."</p>

<p>"He didn't kill it," said Dangar.</p>

<p>The two men looked at him in surprise. "How do you know?"
asked the guard.</p>

<p>"I was there," replied Dangar, "when this man killed the
tarag. He killed it with a spear while Skruf climbed a tree.
After it was dead he came down and cut off its head."</p>

<p>"That sounds like Skruf," said the warrior who had accompanied
them to the ledge; then the two turned their attention to von
Horst.</p>

<p>"So you killed a tarag with a spear?" one demanded, not
without signs of respect.</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head. "Dangar and I killed it together,"
he explained. "It was really he who killed it."</p>

<p>Then Dangar told them how von Horst had faced the beast alone
and impaled it on his spear. It was evident during the recital
that their respect for von Horst was increasing.</p>

<p>"I hope that I am lucky enough to get your heart," said the
guard; then he found tools for them and set them to work with the
other slaves.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he meant when he said that he hoped he
would be lucky enough to get my heart," asked von Horst after the
guard had left them.</p>

<p>"There are men who eat men," replied Dangar. "I have heard of
them."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">VI. &mdash; LA-JA</a></h2>

<p class="first">The shadowy coolness of the cave in which von
Horst and Dangar were put to work was a relief from the glare and
heat of the sun in the open. At first the men were only dimly
aware of the presence of others in the cave; but when their eyes
became accustomed to the subdued light, they saw a number of
slaves chipping at the walls. Some of them were on crude ladders,
slowly extending the cave upward. Most of the slaves were men;
but there were a few women among them, and one of the latter was
working next to von Horst. A Bastian warrior who was directing
the work in the cave watched von Horst for a few moments; then he
stopped him. "Don't you know anything?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You are doing this all wrong. Here!" He turned to the woman
next to the European. "You show him the way, and see that he does
it properly."</p>

<p>Von Horst turned toward the woman, his eyes now accustomed to
the subdued light of the cave. She had stopped work and was
looking at him. The man saw that she was young and very good
looking. Unlike the Bastian women he had seen, she was a
blond.</p>

<p>"Watch me," she said. "Do as I do. They will not ill treat you
if you are slow, but they will if you make a poor job of what you
are doing."</p>

<p>Von Horst watched her for awhile. He noted her regular
features, the long lashes that shaded her large, intelligent
eyes, the alluring contours of her cheek, her neck, and her
small, firm breasts. He decided that she was very much better
looking than his first glance had suggested.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned upon him. "If you watch my hands and the
tools you will learn more quickly," she said.</p>

<p>Von Horst laughed. "But nothing half so pleasant," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"If you wish to do poor work and get beaten, that is your own
affair."</p>

<p>"Watch me," he invited. "See if I have not improved already
just from watching your profile."</p>

<p>With his stone chisel and mallet he commenced to chip away at
the soft chalk; then, after a moment, he turned to her again.
"How is that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well," she admitted reluctantly, "it is better; but it will
have to be <i>much</i> better. When you have been here as long as
I have, you will have learned that it is best to do good
work."</p>

<p>"You have been here long?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For so many sleeps that I have lost count. And you?"</p>

<p>"I just came."</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "Came! You mean that you were just
brought."</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head. "Like a fool, I came. Skruf told us
that we would be well received, that his people would treat us as
friends. He lied to us."</p>

<p>"Skruf!" The girl shuddered. "Skruf is a coward and a liar;
but it is well for me that he is a coward. Otherwise he might
bring the head of a tarag and place it before the entrance to the
cave where I sleep."</p>

<p>Von Horst opened his eyes in astonishment. "You are La-ja,
then?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am La-ja, but how did you know?" In her musical tones her
name was very lovely&mdash;the broad a's, the soft j, and the
accent on the last syllable.</p>

<p>"A guard said that Frug had told Skruf that he might have you
if he brought the head of a tarag. I recalled the name; perhaps
because it is so lovely a name."</p>

<p>She ignored the compliment. "I am still safe, then," she said,
"for that great coward would run from a tarag."</p>

<p>"He did," said von Horst, "but he brought the head of the
beast back to Basti with him."</p>

<p>The girl looked horrified and then skeptical. "You are trying
to tell me that Skruf killed a tarag?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I am trying to tell you nothing of the sort. Dangar and I
killed it; but Skruf cut off its head and brought it with him,
taking the credit."</p>

<p>"He'll never have me!" exclaimed La-ja tensely. "Before that,
I'll destroy myself."</p>

<p>"Isn't there something else you can do? Can't you refuse to
accept him?"</p>

<p>"If I were not a slave, I could; but Frug has promised me to
him; and, being a slave, I have nothing to say in the
matter."</p>

<p>Von Horst suddenly felt a keen personal interest&mdash;just
why, it would have been difficult for him to explain. Perhaps it
was the man's natural reaction to the plight of a defenseless
girl; perhaps her great beauty had something to do with it. But
whatever the cause, he wanted to help her.</p>

<p>"Isn't there any possibility of escape?" he asked. "Can't we
get out of here after dark? Dangar and I would help you and go
with you."</p>

<p>"After dark?" she asked. "After what is dark?" Von Horst
grinned ruefully. "I keep forgetting," he said.</p>

<p>"Forgetting what?"</p>

<p>"That it is never dark here."</p>

<p>"It is dark in the caves," she said.</p>

<p>"In my country it is dark half the time. While it is dark, we
sleep; it is light between sleeps."</p>

<p>"How strange!" she exclaimed. "Where is your country, and how
can it ever be dark? The sun shines always. No one ever heard of
such a thing as the sun's ceasing to shine."</p>

<p>"My country is very far away, in a different world. We do not
have the same sun that you have. Some time I will try to explain
it to you."</p>

<p>"I thought you were not like any man I had ever seen before.
What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Von," he said.</p>

<p>"Von&mdash;yes, that is a strange name, too."</p>

<p>"Stranger than Skruf or Frug?" he asked, grinning.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; there is nothing strange about those names."</p>

<p>"If you heard all of my name, that might sound strange to
you."</p>

<p>"Is there more than Von?"</p>

<p>"Very much more."</p>

<p>"Tell it to me."</p>

<p>"My name is Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und von
Horst."</p>

<p>"Oh, I could never say all that. I think I like Von."</p>

<p>He wondered why he had told her that Frederich Wilhelm Eric
von Mendeldorf und von Horst was his name. Of course he had used
it for so long that it seemed quite natural to him; but now that
he was no longer in Germany, perhaps it was senseless to continue
with it. Yet what difference did it make in the inner world? Von
was an easy name to pronounce, an easy one to remember&mdash;Von
he would continue to be, then.</p>

<p>Presently the girl yawned. "I am sleepy," she said. "I shall
go to my cave and sleep. Why do you not sleep at the same time;
then we shall be awake at the same time, and&mdash;why, I can
show you about your work."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," he exclaimed, "but will they let me
sleep now? I just started to work."</p>

<p>"They let us sleep whenever we wish to, but when we awaken we
have to come right back to work. The women sleep in a cave by
themselves, and there is a Basti woman to watch them and see that
they get to work as soon as they are awake. She is a terrible old
thing."</p>

<p>"Where do I sleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Come, I'll show you. It is the cave next to the women's."</p>

<p>She led the way out onto the ledge and along it to the mouth
of another cave. "Here is where the men sleep," she said. "The
next cave is where I sleep."</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here?" demanded a guard.</p>

<p>"We are going to sleep," replied La-ja.</p>

<p>The man nodded; and the girl went on to her cave, while von
Horst entered that reserved for the men slaves. He found a number
of them asleep on the hard floor, and was soon stretched out
beside Dangar, who had accompanied them.</p>

<p>How long he slept, von Horst did not know. He was awakened
suddenly by loud shouting apparently directly outside the
entrance to the cave. At first he did not grasp the meaning of
the words he heard; but presently, after a couple of repetitions,
he was thoroughly awake; and then he grasped their full import
and recognized the voice of the speaker.</p>

<p>It was Skruf; and he was shouting, over and over.</p>

<p>"Come out, La-ja! Skruf has brought you the head of a tarag.
Now you belong to Skruf."</p>

<p>Von Horst leaped to his feet and stepped out onto the ledge.
There, before the entrance to the adjoining cave, lay the rotting
head of the tarag; but Skruf was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>At first von Horst thought that he had entered the cave in
search of La-ja; but presently he realized that the voice was
coming from below. Looking over the edge of the ledge, he saw
Skruf standing on a ladder a few feet below. Then he saw La-ja
run from the cave, her countenance a picture of tragic
despair.</p>

<p>He had stepped to the head of the ladder, beside which lay the
tarag's head, and so was directly in front of the mouth of the
cave as La-ja emerged. Something about her manner, her
expression, frightened him. She did not seem to see him as she
ran past him toward the edge of the cliff. Intuitively, he knew
what was in her mind; and as she passed him, he threw an arm
about her and drew her back.</p>

<p>"Not that, La-ja," he said quietly.</p>

<p>She came to herself with a start, as though from a trance.
Then she clung to him and commenced to sob. "There is no other
way," she cried. "He must not get me."</p>

<p>"He shall not," said the man; then he looked down upon Skruf.
"Get out of here," he said, "and take your rotten head with you."
With his foot, he pushed the mass of corruption over the edge of
the ledge so that it fell full upon Skruf. For an instant it
seemed that it had toppled him from the ladder, but with the
agility of a monkey he regained his hold.</p>

<p>"Go on down," directed von Horst, "and don't come up here
again. This girl is not for you."</p>

<p>"She belongs to me; Frug said I could have her. I'll have you
killed for this." The man was almost frothing at the mouth, so
angry was he.</p>

<p>"Go down, or I'll come down there and throw you down,"
threatened von Horst.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on his shoulder. He swung around. It was
Dangar who stood beside him. "Here comes the guard," he said.
"You are in for it now. I am with you. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>The guard was coming along the ledge, the same big fellow that
had received them. There were other guards in the several caves
that were being excavated, but so far the attention of only this
one seemed to have been attracted.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, slave?" he bellowed. "Get to work! What
you need is a little of this."</p>

<p>He swung a club in his hairy right fist.</p>

<p>"You're not going to hit me with that," said von Horst. "If
you come any closer, I'll kill you."</p>

<p>"Your pistol, Von," whispered Dangar.</p>

<p>"I can't waste ammunition," he replied.</p>

<p>The guard had paused. He seemed to be attempting to discover
just how the slave intended killing him and with what. To all
appearances the man was unarmed; and while he was tall, he was
far from being as heavy a man as the guard. Finally the fellow
must have concluded that von Horst's words were pure bluff, for
he came on again.</p>

<p>"You'll kill me, will you?" he roared; then he rushed forward
with club upraised.</p>

<p>He was not very fast on his feet, and his brain was even
slower&mdash;his reactions were pitifully retarded. So when von
Horst leaped forward to meet him, he was not quick enough to
change his method of attack in time to meet the emergency. Von
Horst stepped quickly to one side as the fellow lunged abreast of
him; then he swung a terrific blow to the Bastian's chin, a blow
that threw him off balance on the very brink of the ledge. As he
tottered there, von Horst struck him again; and this time he
toppled out into space; and, with a scream of fright, plunged
down toward the bottom of the cliff a hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Dangar and the girl stood there wide-eyed in
consternation.</p>

<p>"What have you done, Von!" cried the latter. "They will kill
you now&mdash;and all on my account."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, another guard emerged from one of the caves
farther along the ledge; and then the remaining two came from the
other caves in which they had been directing the work of the
slaves. The scream of the fellow that von Horst had knocked from
the ledge had attracted their attention.</p>

<p>"Get behind me," von Horst directed La-ja and Dangar, "and
fall back to the far end of the ledge. They can't take us if they
can't get behind us."</p>

<p>"They'll have us cornered then, and there will be no hope for
us," objected the girl. "If we go into one of the caves where it
is not so light and where there are loose bits of rock to throw
at them we may be able to hold them off. But even so, what good
will that do? They will get us anyway, no matter what we do."</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," snapped von Horst, "and be quick about
it."</p>

<p>"Who are you to give me orders?" demanded La-ja. "I am the
daughter of a chief."</p>

<p>Von Horst wheeled and pushed her back into Dangar's arms.
"Take her to the far end of the ledge," he ordered; then he fell
back with them, as Dangar dragged the furious La-ja along the
ledge. The guards were advancing toward the three. They did not
know exactly what had happened, but they knew that something was
wrong.</p>

<p>"Where is Julp?" demanded one.</p>

<p>"Where you will be if you don't do as I tell you," replied von
Horst.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that, slave? Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I knocked him off the ledge. Look down." The three paused and
peered over the edge. Below them they saw the body of Julp, and
now the angry voices of those who had gathered about it rose to
them. Skruf was there. He alone could surmise what had befallen
Julp, and he was telling the others about it in a loud tone of
voice as Frug joined the group.</p>

<p>"Bring that slave down to me," Frug shouted to the guards on
the ledge.</p>

<p>The three started forward again to seize von Horst. The man
whipped his pistol from its holster. "Wait!" he commanded. "If
you don't wish to die, listen to me. There is the ladder. Go
down."</p>

<p>The three eyed the pistol, but they did not know what it was.
To them it was nothing more than a bit of black stone. Perhaps
they thought that von Horst purposed throwing it at them or using
it as a club. The idea made them grin; so they came on,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>Now, the woman who guarded the women slaves came from their
cave, attracted by all the commotion outside, and joined the men.
She was an unprepossessing slattern of indeterminate age with a
vicious countenance. Von Horst guessed that she might be even
more formidable than the men, but he shrank from the necessity of
shooting down a woman. In fact, he did not wish to shoot any of
them&mdash;poor ignorant cave dwellers of the stone age&mdash;but
it was their lives or his and Dangar's and La-ja's.</p>

<p>"Go back!" he cried. "Go down the ladder. I don't wish to kill
you."</p>

<p>For answer, the men laughed at him and came on. Then von Horst
fired. One of the men was directly behind the leader, and at the
shot they both collapsed, screaming, and rolled from the ledge.
The other man and the woman stopped. The report of the pistol
would alone have been sufficient to give them pause, so
terrifying was it to them; but when they saw their comrades pitch
from the ledge their simple minds were overwhelmed.</p>

<p>"Go down," von Horst commanded them, "before I kill you, too.
I shall not give you another chance."</p>

<p>The woman snarled and hesitated, but the man did not wait. He
had seen enough. He sprang toward the ladder and hastened to
descend, and a moment later the woman gave up and followed him.
Von Horst watched them; and when they had reached the next ledge
below, he motioned Dangar to him. "Give me a hand with this
ladder," he said, and the two dragged it up to the ledge on which
they stood. "This will stop them for awhile," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Until they bring another ladder," suggested Dangar.</p>

<p>"That will take a little time," replied von Horst,"&mdash;a
long time if I take a shot at them while they are doing it."</p>

<p>"Now, what are we to do next?" inquired Dangar.</p>

<p>La-ja was eyeing von Horst from beneath lowering brows, her
eyes twin pits of smoldering anger; but she did not speak. Von
Horst looked at her and was glad that she did not. He saw trouble
ahead in that beautiful, angry face&mdash;beautiful even in
anger.</p>

<p>The other slaves were now coming fearfully from the caves.
They looked about for the guards and saw none; then they saw that
the ladder had been drawn up.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" one asked.</p>

<p>"This fool has killed three guards and driven the others
away," snapped La-ja. "Now we must either remain here and starve
to death or let them come up and kill us."</p>

<p>Von Horst paid no attention to them. He was looking up,
scanning the face of the cliff that inclined slightly inward to
the summit about thirty feet above him.</p>

<p>"He killed three guards and drove the others off the ledge?"
demanded one of the slaves, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dangar; "alone, he did it."</p>

<p>"He is a great warrior," said the slave, admiringly.</p>

<p>"You are right, Thorek," agreed another. "But La-ja is right,
too; it is death for us now no matter what happens."</p>

<p>"Death but comes a little sooner; that is all," replied
Thorek. "It is worth it to know that three of these eaters of men
have been killed. I wish that I had done it."</p>

<p>"Are you going to wait up here until you starve to death or
they come up and kill you?" demanded von Horst.</p>

<p>"What else is there to do?" demanded a slave from Amdar.</p>

<p>"There are nearly fifty of us," said von Horst. "It would be
better to go down and fight for our lives than wait here to die
of thirst or be killed like rats, if there were no other way; but
I think there is."</p>

<p>"Your words are the words of a man," exclaimed Thorek. "I will
go down with you and fight."</p>

<p>"What is the other way?" asked the man from Amdar.</p>

<p>"We have this ladder," explained von Horst, "and there are
other ladders in the caves. By fastening some of them together we
can reach the top of the cliff. We could be a long way off before
the Bastians could overtake us, for they would have to go far
down the gorge before they came to a place where they could climb
out of it."</p>

<p>"He is right," said another slave.</p>

<p>"But they might overtake us," suggested another who was
timid.</p>

<p>"Let them!" cried Thorek. "I am a mammoth man. Should I fear
to fight with my enemies? Never. All my life I have fought them.
It was for this that my mother bore me and my father trained
me."</p>

<p>"We talk too much," said von Horst. "Talk will not save us.
Let those who wish to, come with me; let the others remain here.
Fetch the other ladders. See what you can find with which to
fasten them together."</p>

<p>"Here comes Frug!" shouted a slave. "He is coming up with many
warriors."</p>

<p>Von Horst looked down to see the hairy chief climbing upward
toward the ledge; behind him came many warriors. The man from the
outer crust grinned, for he knew that his position was
impregnable.</p>

<p>"Thorek," he said, "take men into the caves to gather
fragments of rock, but do not throw them down upon the Bastians
until I give you the word."</p>

<p>"I am a mammoth man," replied Thorek, haughtily. "I do not
take orders from any but my chief."</p>

<p>"Right now I am your chief," snapped von Horst. "Do as I tell
you. If each of us tries to be chief, if no one will do as I
order, we may stay here until we rot."</p>

<p>"I take orders from no man who is not a better man than I,"
insisted Thorek.</p>

<p>"What does he mean, Dangar?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"He means you'll have to fight him&mdash;and win&mdash;before
he'll obey you," explained the Sarian.</p>

<p>"Are all the rest of you fools too?" demanded von Horst. "Do I
have to fight each one of you before you will help me to help you
escape?"</p>

<p>"If you defeat Thorek, I will obey you," said the man from
Amdar.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," agreed von Horst. "Dangar, if any of these
idiots will help you, go in and get rocks to hold off Frug until
the matter is settled. Just try to keep them from setting up
another ladder to this ledge. Thorek, you and I will go into one
of the caves and see who is head man. If we tried to decide the
matter out here, we'd probably both wind up at the bottom of the
cliff."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed the mammoth man. "I like your talk. You
will make a great chief&mdash;if you win; but you won't. I am
Thorek, and I am a mammoth man."</p>

<p>Von Horst was almost amused by the evidences of haughty pride
that these primitive people revealed. He had seen it in La-ja in
an exaggerated form and now, again, in Thorek. Perhaps he admired
them a little for it&mdash;he had no patience with spineless
worms&mdash;but he felt that they might have mixed a little
common sense with it. He realized, however, that it reflected a
tremendous ego, such as the human race must have possessed in its
earliest stages to have permitted it to cope with the forces that
must constantly have threatened it with extinction.</p>

<p>He turned to Thorek. "Come," he said; "let's get it over, so
that something worth while can be done." As he spoke, he entered
one of the caves; and Thorek followed him.</p>

<p>"With bare hands?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"With bare hands," agreed the mammoth man.</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>Von Horst, from boyhood, had been a keen devotee of all modes
of defense and offense with various weapons and with none at all.
He had excelled as an amateur boxer and wrestler. Heretofore it
had availed him little of practical value, other than a certain
prideful satisfaction in his ability; but now it was to mean very
much indeed. It was to establish his position in the stone age
among a rugged people who admitted no superiority that was not
physical.</p>

<p>At his invitation, Thorek charged down upon him like a wild
bull. In height they were quite evenly matched, but Thorek was
stockier and outweighed von Horst by ten or fifteen pounds. Their
strength was, perhaps, about equal, though the Pellucidarian
looked far more powerful because of his bulging muscles. It was
skill that would count, and Thorek had no skill. His strategy
consisted in overwhelming an antagonist by impetus and weight,
crushing him to earth, and pummeling him into insensibility. If
he killed him in the process&mdash;well, that was just the other
fellow's tough luck.</p>

<p>But when he threw himself at von Horst, von Horst was not
there. He had ducked beneath the flailing arms and sidestepped
the heavy body; then he had landed a heavy blow at Thorek's jaw
that had snapped his head and dazed him. But the fellow still
kept his feet, turned, and came lumbering in again for more; and
he got it. This time he went down. He tried to stagger to his
feet, and another blow sent him sprawling. He didn't have a
chance. Every time he got part way to his feet, he was knocked
flat again. At last he gave up and lay where he had fallen.</p>

<p>"Who is chief?" demanded von Horst.</p>

<p>"You are," said Thorek.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">VII. &mdash; FLIGHT OF THE
SLAVES</a></h2>

<p class="first">As von Horst turned and ran out of the cave,
Thorek rose groggily to his feet and followed him. On the ledge a
number of the slaves were lined up with Dangar ready to hurl
rocks on the ascending Bastians, whom von Horst saw had reached
the second ledge below that was occupied by the slaves. He looked
about and saw Thorek emerging from the cave. "Take some men and
get the ladders," von Horst directed his late antagonist.</p>

<p>The other slaves looked quickly at the mammoth man to see how
he would accept this command. What they saw astonished them.
Thorek's face was already badly swollen, there was a cut above
one eye and his nose was bleeding. His whole face and much of his
body were covered with blood, which made his injuries appear
graver than they really were.</p>

<p>Thorek turned toward the other slaves. "Some of you go into
each cave and bring out the ladders," he said. "Let the women
find thongs with which to bind them together."</p>

<p>"Who is chief?" asked one of the men so addressed.</p>

<p>"He is chief," replied Thorek, pointing at von Horst.</p>

<p>"He is not my chief, and neither are you," retorted the man,
belligerently.</p>

<p>Von Horst was suddenly hopeless. How could he get anywhere,
how could he accomplish anything, with such stupid egotists to
contend with? Thorek, however, was not at all discouraged. He
suddenly leaped upon the fellow; and before the man had time to
gather his slow wits, lifted him above his head and hurled him
from the cliff. Then he turned to the others. "Get the ladders,"
he said, and as one man they set about doing his bidding.</p>

<p>Now von Horst turned his attention again to Frug and the other
warriors below. They offered an excellent target; and he could
easily have driven them back had he cared to, but he had another
plan. In low tones he issued instructions to his companions,
having them line up along the ledge while the Bastians climbed to
that directly below. In the meantime the ladders had been carried
out; and the women were busy lashing several of them together,
making two long ladders.</p>

<p>La-ja stood sullenly apart, glaring at von Horst, and making
no pretense of helping the other women with their work; but the
man paid no attention to her, which probably added to her
resentment and her wrath. Frug was bellowing threats and commands
from the ledge below, and from the bottom of the cliff the women
and children were shouting encouragement to their men.</p>

<p>"Bring me the man called Von," shouted Frug, "and none of the
rest of you shall be punished."</p>

<p>"Come up and get him," challenged Thorek.</p>

<p>"If the men of Basti were better than old women they would do
something more than stand down there and shout," taunted von
Horst. He threw a small fragment of rock that struck Frug on the
shoulder. "See," he exclaimed, "how easily we could drive away
the old women who are not strong enough to hurl their spears up
here!"</p>

<p>That insult was too much for the Bastians. Instantly spears
began to fly; but the slaves were ready, and as the weapons rose
to their level they reached out and seized many of them. As the
others dropped back to the Bastians, they were hurled again; and
soon the slaves were armed, as von Horst had hoped.</p>

<p>"Now, the rocks," he directed; and the slaves commenced to
pelt their antagonists with small missiles until they took refuge
in the caves on the level below. "Don't let them come out,"
ordered von Horst. "Dangar, you take five men and let every
Bastian that shows his head get a rock on it; the rest of you men
raise the ladders."</p>

<p>When the ladders, rickety and sagging, were leaned, against
the cliff they just topped its summit; and von Horst breathed a
sigh of relief as he saw the success of his plan thus more nearly
assured. He turned to Thorek. "Take three men and go to the top
of the cliff. If the way is clear, tell me; and I will send up
the women and the rest of the men."</p>

<p>As Thorek and the three climbed aloft, the ladders creaked and
bent; but they held, and presently the mammoth man called down
that all was well.</p>

<p>"Now, the women," said von Horst; and all the women but one
started up the ladders. That one was La-ja. She ignored the
ladders as she had ignored von Horst, and again the man paid no
attention to her. Soon all but Dangar and his five men, von
Horst, and La-ja had climbed safely to the cliff top. One by one,
von Horst sent the five up; and he and Dangar kept the Bastians
below confined in the caves where they might not know what was
going on upon the ledge above; for he knew that they could bring
other ladders from the caves in which they were hiding and enough
of them reach the ledge that he and Dangar were defending to
overcome them easily.</p>

<p>La-ja, now, was his greatest problem. Had she been a man, he
would have left her; and his better judgment told him that he
should leave her anyway, but he could not. Perhaps she was a
stubborn little fool; but he realized that he could not know what
strange standards of pride, custom, environment, and heredity had
bequeathed her. How might he judge her? Her attitude might seem
right and proper to her, no matter how indefensible it appeared
to him.</p>

<p>"I wish you would go up with the others, La-ja," he said. "We
three may be recaptured if you don't."</p>

<p>"Go yourself, if you wish," she retorted. "La-ja will remain
here."</p>

<p>"Do not forget Skruf," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Skruf will never have me. I can always die," she replied.</p>

<p>"You will not come, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I would rather stay with Skruf than go with you."</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged and turned away. The girl was watching him
intently to see what effects her insult had upon him, and she
flushed with anger when he showed no resentment.</p>

<p>"Give them a few more rocks, Dangar," directed von Horst;
"then get to the cliff top as fast as you can."</p>

<p>"And you?" asked the Sarian.</p>

<p>"I shall follow you."</p>

<p>"And leave the girl?"</p>

<p>"She refuses to come," replied von Horst.</p>

<p>Dangar shrugged. "She needs a beating," he said.</p>

<p>"I would kill any man that laid a hand on me," said La-ja,
belligerently.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you need a beating," insisted Dangar; "then you
would have more sense." He gathered up several rocks and hurled
them at a head that appeared from one of the caves below; then he
turned and swarmed up one of the ladders.</p>

<p>Von Horst walked toward the other ladder. It took him close to
La-ja. Suddenly he seized her. "I am going to take you with me,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You are not," she cried, and commenced to strike and kick
him.</p>

<p>Without great difficulty he carried her as far as the ladder;
but when he tried to ascend it, she clung to it. He struggled
upward and gained a couple of rounds, but she fought so viciously
and clung so desperately that he soon saw they must be overtaken
if the Bastians reached this ledge.</p>

<p>Already he heard their voices raised more loudly from below,
indicating that they had come from the caves. He heard Frug
directing the raising of a ladder. In a moment they would be upon
them. He looked down at the beautiful face of the angry girl. He
could drop her and leave her to the tender mercies of the
Bastians. There was still time for him to gain the summit of the
cliff alone. But there was another way, a way he shrank from; yet
he saw no alternative if he were to save them both. He drew back
a clenched fist and struck her heavily on the side of the head,
and instantly she went limp in his arms; then he climbed upward
as rapidly as he could with the dead weight of the unconscious
girl hampering his every movement. He had almost reached the top
when he heard a shout of triumph below him. Glancing downward, he
saw a Bastian just clambering onto the ledge upon which the
ladder rested. If the fellow could lay hands upon the ladder he
could drag them down to death or recapture. Von Horst shifted the
weight of the girl so that her body hung balanced over his left
shoulder. This freed his left hand so that he could cling to the
ladder as he drew his pistol with his right. He had to swing out
and backward to get a bead on the Bastian; and he had to do all
this in a fraction of the time it takes to tell it; for if the
first man reached the ledge, there would be another directly
behind him; and one shot would not stop them both.</p>

<p>He fired just as the Bastian was about to step from the ladder
to the ledge. The fellow toppled backward. There were yells and
curses from below; and though von Horst could not see what
happened, he was certain that the falling body had knocked others
from the ladder. Once again he hastened upward, and a moment
later Dangar and Thorek reached down and dragged him and the girl
to the summit of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Your luck is with you," said Thorek. "Look; they are right
behind you."</p>

<p>Von Horst looked down. The Bastians had raised other ladders
and were clambering rapidly onto the ledge below. Some of them
were already climbing the ladders that the slaves had raised to
the cliff top. Others of the slaves were standing near von Horst
looking down at the Bastians. "We had better run," said one.
"They will soon be up here."</p>

<p>"Why run?" demanded Thorek. "Are we not armed even better than
they? We have most of their spears."</p>

<p>"I have a better plan," said von Horst. "Wait until the
ladders are full."</p>

<p>He called other slaves to him then, and waited. It was but a
matter of seconds when the ladders were both filled with climbing
Bastians; then von Horst gave the word, and a score of hands
pushed the ladders outward from the face of the cliff. Screams of
terror broke from the lips of the doomed Bastians as the slaves
toppled the ladders over backward, and a dozen bodies hurtled
down the face of the cliff to fall at the feet of the women and
children.</p>

<p>"Now," said von Horst, "let's get out of here." He looked down
at the girl still lying on the sward where they had placed her,
and he was suddenly stunned by the realization that she might be
dead&mdash;that the blow he had struck her had killed her. He
dropped to his knees beside her and placed an ear over her heart.
It was beating, and beating strongly. With a sigh of relief, he
lifted the inanimate form to his shoulder again.</p>

<p>"Where to now?" he asked, addressing the entire gathering of
escaped slaves.</p>

<p>"At first we'd better get out of the Bastian country,"
counseled Thorek. "After that, we can plan."</p>

<p>The way led through hills and mountain gorges, and finally out
into a lovely valley teeming with wild life; but though they
often encountered fierce beasts they were not attacked.</p>

<p>"There are too many of us," explained Dangar when von Horst
commented upon their apparent immunity. "Occasionally you'll find
a beast that will attack a whole tribe of men, but ordinarily
they are afraid of us when we are in numbers."</p>

<p>Long before they reached the valley, La-ja regained
consciousness. "Where am I?" she demanded. "What has
happened?"</p>

<p>Von Horst lowered her from his shoulder and steadied her until
he saw that she could stand. "I brought you away from Basti," he
explained. "We are free now."</p>

<p>She looked at him, knitting her brows as though trying to
recall a fleeting memory that eluded her. "You brought me!" she
said. "I said I would not come with you. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I put you to sleep," he fumbled
hesitatingly. The thought that he had struck her humiliated
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember," she said; "you struck me."</p>

<p>"I had to," he replied. "I am very sorry, but there was no
other way. I could not leave you there among those beasts."</p>

<p>"But you did strike me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I struck you."</p>

<p>"Why did you wish to bring me? Why did you care whether or not
I was left to Skruf?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see&mdash;I&mdash;but how could I leave you
there?"</p>

<p>"If you think I am going to be your mate now, you are
mistaken," she said with emphasis.</p>

<p>Von Horst hushed. The young lady seemed to be jumping to
embarrassing conclusions. She was certainly candid. Perhaps that
was a characteristic of the stone age. "No," he replied; "after
the things that you said to me and did to me, I had no reason
either to believe that you would be my mate or that I would wish
you to be."</p>

<p>"Well." she snapped; "I wouldn't be&mdash;I should prefer
Skruf."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said von Horst. "Now we understand one another."</p>

<p>"And hereafter," said La-ja, "you can attend to your own
affairs and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied stiffly, "just so long as you obey
me."</p>

<p>"I obey no one."</p>

<p>"You'll obey me," he said determinedly, "or I'll punch your
head again," The words surprised him much more than they seemed
to surprise the girl. How could he have said such a thing to a
woman? Was he reverting to some primordial type? Was he becoming,
indeed, a man of the old stone age? She walked away from him then
and joined the women. On her lips was a strange little melody,
such perhaps as women of the outer crust hummed to the singing
stars when the world was young.</p>

<p>When they reached the valley, some of the men made a kill; and
they all ate. Then they held a council, discussing plans for the
future.</p>

<p>Each individual wished to go his way to his own country, and
while there was safety in numbers there was also danger to each
in going into the country of another. There were some, like
Dangar, who could promise a friendly reception to those who
wished to accompany them to their land; but there were few who
dared take the chance. Both von Horst and Dangar recalled the
fair promises of Skruf and the manner in which they had been
belied.</p>

<p>To von Horst, it was a strange world; but then, he realized,
it might be anywhere from fifty thousand to half a million years
younger than the world with which he was familiar, with a
corresponding different philosophy and code of ethics. Yet these
people were quite similar to types of the outer crust. They were
more naive, perhaps; less artificial, and they certainly had
fewer inhibitions; but they revealed, usually in a slightly
exaggerated form, all the characteristics of present day men and
women of a much older humanity.</p>

<p>He considered La-ja. Envisioning her frocked in the latest
mode, he realized that she might pass unnoticed, except for her
great beauty, in any capital of Europe. No one would dream, to
look at her, that she had stepped from the Pleistocene. He was
not so certain, however, as to what one might think who crossed
her.</p>

<p>The result of the council was a decision of each to return to
his own country. There were several from Amdar, and they would go
together. There were others from Go-hal. Thorek came from Ja-ru,
the country of the mammoth-men; La-ja from Lo-har; Dangar, from
Sari. These three, with von Horst, could proceed together for
awhile, as their paths lay in the same general direction.</p>

<p>After the council, they sought and found a place to
sleep&mdash;a place of caves in cliffs. As they awoke, each
individual or each party set out in the direction of his own
country with only instinct as his guide. The countries of most of
them were not far distant. Sari was the farthest. From what Von
Horst could gather, it might be half way around this savage
world; but what was a matter of distance when there was no time
by which to measure the duration of a journey?</p>

<p>There were no goodbyes. A group or an individual walked out of
the lives of those others with whom they had suffered long
imprisonment, with whom they had fought and won to freedom; and
there was no sign of regret at parting&mdash;just the knowledge
that when next they met, they would meet as mortal enemies, each
eager to slay the other. This was true of most of them, but not
of all. There was a real friendship existing between von Horst
and Dangar, and something that approached it between these two
and Thorek. Where La-ja stood, who might know? She was very
aloof. Perhaps because she was the daughter of a chief; perhaps
because she was a very beautiful young woman whose pride had been
hurt, or who was nursing a knowledge that her woman's intuition
had vouchsafed her, or because she was by nature reserved.
Whatever her reason, she kept her own counsel.</p>

<p>Several sleeps after the party of slaves had broken up, Thorek
announced that his path now diverged from theirs. "I wish that
you were coming to Ja-ru with me," he said to von Horst. "You
should have been a mammoth man; we are all great warriors. If we
ever meet again, let us meet as friends."</p>

<p>"That suits me," replied von Horst. "May it hold for all of
us." He looked at Dangar and La-ja.</p>

<p>"A Sarian may be friends with any brave warrior," said the
former. "I would be friends always with you."</p>

<p>"I would be friends with Thorek and Dangar," said La-ja.</p>

<p>"And not with Von?" asked the Sarian.</p>

<p>"I would not be friends with Von," she replied.</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged and smiled. "But I am your friend, always,
La-ja," he said.</p>

<p>"I do not wish you for a friend," she replied. "Did I not say
so?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can't help yourself."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that," she said, enigmatically.</p>

<p>So Thorek left them, and the three continued on their way. It
seemed a hopeless, aimless journey to von Horst. In the bottom of
his consciousness, he did not believe that either Dangar or La-ja
had the slightest conception of where they were going. He did not
possess the homing instinct himself, and so he could not conceive
that such a sense existed in man or woman.</p>

<p>When they were confronted by high mountains they circled them.
They followed mysterious rivers until they found a ford, and then
they crossed in constant danger from weird reptiles that had been
long extinct upon the outer crust. The fords were quite bad
enough; they never dared swim a river. Never did they know what
lay ahead of them, for this country was as strange to the two
Pellucidarians as it was to von Horst.</p>

<p>They came through low hills to a narrow valley upon the far
side of which grew a dense forest, such a forest as von Horst had
never seen before in this world or his own. Even at a distance it
looked grim and forbidding. As they passed down the valley, von
Horst was glad that their way did not lead through the forest;
for he knew how depressing the long gloom of a broad forest might
become.</p>

<p>Presently La-ja stopped. "Which way is your country, Dangar?"
she asked.</p>

<p>He pointed down the valley. "That way," he said, "until we
reach the end of these high hills; then I turn to the right."</p>

<p>"It is not my way," said La-ja. "Lo-har lies this way," and
she pointed straight toward the forest. "Now I must leave you and
go to my own country."</p>

<p>"The forest does not look good to me," said Dangar. "Perhaps
you would never get through it alive. Come to Sari with Von and
me. You will be well treated."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I am the daughter of a chief," she
said. "I must return to Lo-har and bear sons, for my father has
none; otherwise there will be no good chief to rule over my
father's people after he is dead."</p>

<p>"But you cannot go alone," said von Horst. "You could never
come through alive. You would merely be throwing away your life,
and then you would never have any sons at all."</p>

<p>"I must go," she insisted, "or for what purpose am I the
daughter of a chief?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of a chief," she said, with her chin in the
air, defiantly; but von Horst thought that her square little chin
trembled. Perhaps it was just a shadow.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Dangar," she said presently, and turned away from
them toward the forest. She did not say goodbye to von Horst; she
did not even look at him.</p>

<p>The man from the outer crust watched the trim, clean cut
figure of the girl as she made her way toward the wood. He noted
for the thousandth time the poise of that blond head, the almost
regal carriage, the soft and graceful tread of the panther.</p>

<p>The man did not know what motivated him, he could not
interpret the urges that seemed to possess him; something quite
beyond reason, something that exhilarated one as might an
inspiration, prompted him. He did not wish to reason it out; he
wished merely to obey.</p>

<p>He turned to Dangar. "Goodbye," he said.</p>

<p>"Goodbye?" exclaimed Dangar. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to Lo-har with La-ja," replied von Horst.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE FOREST OF
DEATH</a></h2>

<p class="first">Dangar looked at von Horst with surprise as the
latter announced that he was going with La-ja.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he replied. "I have one excellent reason, and
that is that I could not see a girl go alone through this savage
country, into that beastly looking forest; but I know that there
is something else, much deeper, that impels me; something as
inexplicable and inescapable as instinct."</p>

<p>"I will come with you," said Dangar.</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. Go on to Sari. If I live, I'll follow you later."</p>

<p>"You could never find Sari."</p>

<p>"With your help, I can."</p>

<p>"How can I help you if I am not with you?" demanded
Dangar.</p>

<p>"You can blaze the trail. Put marks on trees. Place stones
upon the ground, like this, showing the direction you are going."
He placed some stones in a row pointing in the direction they had
been going, forming an arrow. "Mostly you follow animal trails;
so you will have only to indicate the places that you branch off
from the main trails. If you will do these things, I can follow
you. I shall blaze my trail from here to wherever I go; so that I
can find my way back."</p>

<p>"I do not like to leave you," said Dangar.</p>

<p>"It is best," replied von Horst. "There is a girl waiting for
you in Sari. There is no one waiting for me anywhere. We do not
know how far it is to La-ja's country. We might never reach it;
we might never return if we did. It is best that you go on to
Sari."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Dangar. "I shall be expecting you there.
Goodbye." He turned and started off down the little valley.</p>

<p>Von Horst watched him for a moment, thinking of the strange
circumstances that had brought them together across five hundred
thousand years; thinking also of the even more remarkable fact
that they had found so much in common upon which to build an
enduring friendship. He sighed and turned in the direction that
La-ja had gone.</p>

<p>The girl was half way to the forest, swinging along easily
with her chin up and never looking back. She looked so little
against the background of that mighty forest, and so brave.
Something very much like tears momentarily dimmed the man's eyes
as he watched her; then he set out after her.</p>

<p>Something of what he was doing he realized, but not all. He
knew that it was quite likely that he was following the girl into
an untracked wilderness from which neither of them would ever
emerge; and that he was cutting himself off, doubtlessly forever,
from his only friend in all this savage world, from the chance to
go to a country where he might live in comparative security and
make new friends&mdash;and all this for a girl who shunned and
snubbed him. But what he did not know was that Jason Gridley
would eventually decide to remain in the inner world, when the
rest of the expedition sailed for the north polar opening and the
outer crust, and proceed to Sari, there to form an expedition to
search for him. He did not know that he was quite probably
throwing away this one chance for succor; but if he had known it,
there is little likelihood that it would have altered his
decision.</p>

<p>He overtook La-ja just at the edge of the forest. She had
heard his footsteps behind her and had turned to see who or what
was following her. She did not seem greatly surprised. In fact,
it seemed to von Horst that nothing could surprise La-ja.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I am going with you to Lo-har," he replied.</p>

<p>"The warriors of Lo-har will probably kill you when you get
there," she prophesied cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I am going with you just the same," insisted von Horst.</p>

<p>"I did not ask you to come. You had better go back and go to
Sari with Dangar."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, La-ja," he begged. "I cannot let you go alone,
knowing the dangers you may have to face&mdash;wild beasts and
savage men. I must go with you as long as there is no one else to
go; so why can't we be friends? Why do you dislike me so? What
have I done?"</p>

<p>"If you come with me it will have to be as though we were
friends&mdash;just friends&mdash;whether we are friends or not,"
she replied, ignoring his last two queries. "Do you understand
that&mdash;just as friends?"</p>

<p>"I understand," he said. "Have I ever asked more of you?"</p>

<p>"No." She rather snapped the word.</p>

<p>"Nor shall I. My only thought is for your safety. When you are
among your own people, I shall leave you."</p>

<p>"If they don't kill you before you can escape," she reminded
him.</p>

<p>"Why should they wish to kill me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger; and we always kill strangers, so that
they will not kill us&mdash;or nearly always. Sometimes, if we
have reason to like them very much we let them live; but Gaz will
not like you. He will kill you if the others don't."</p>

<p>"Who is Gaz? Why should he wish to kill me?"</p>

<p>"Gaz is a great warrior, a mighty hunter; single-handed he has
killed a ryth."</p>

<p>"I am not a ryth; so I still don't see why he should wish to
kill me," insisted von Horst.</p>

<p>"He will not like it when he learns that we have been together
for so many sleeps. He is a very jealous man."</p>

<p>"What is he to you?" demanded von Horst.</p>

<p>"He hoped to mate with me before I was captured by the
Bastian. If he has not taken another mate, he will still wish to.
Gaz has a very quick temper and a very bad one. He has killed
many men. Often he kills them first and then inquires about them
later. Thus has he killed many men whom he would not have killed
had he taken the time to discover that they had not harmed
him."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to mate with him?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shapely shoulders. "I must mate with someone,
for I must bear sons that Lo-har may have a chief when my father
dies; and La-ja would mate only with a mighty man. Gaz is a
mighty man."</p>

<p>"I asked you if you wished to mate with him&mdash;do you love
him, La-ja?"</p>

<p>"I do not love anyone," she replied; "and, furthermore, it is
none of your affair. You are always meddling and asking questions
that do not concern you. Come, if you are coming with me. We
cannot get to Lo-har by standing still talking nonsense."</p>

<p>"You will have to lead the way," he said. "I do not know where
Lo-har lies."</p>

<p>They started on. "Where is your country?" she asked. "Perhaps
it lies beyond Lo-har in the same direction. That would be fine
for you, provided, of course, that you got out of Lo-har
alive."</p>

<p>"I do not know where my country is," he admitted.</p>

<p>She knitted her brows and looked at him in astonishment. "You
mean that you could not find your way home?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Just that. I wouldn't have the faintest idea even in which
direction to start."</p>

<p>"How strange," she commented. "I have never heard of any so
stupid as that, other than the poor creatures whose heads are
sick. They know nothing at all. I have seen a few such. They get
that way from blows on the head. Once a boy I knew fell out of a
tree and landed on his head. He was never right again. He used to
think he was a tarag and go roaring and growling about on his
hands and knees, but one day his father got tired of listening to
him and killed him."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am like that boy?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"I have never seen you act like a tarag," she admitted; "but
you do have very peculiar ways, and in many things you are very
stupid."</p>

<p>Von Horst could not repress a smile, and the girl saw him. She
appeared nettled. "Do you think it anything to laugh about?" she
demanded. "Say, what are you doing? Why do you chop at so many
trees with your knife? That is enough to make one think that
there may be something the matter with your head."</p>

<p>"I am marking the trail that we pass," he explained, "so that
I can find my way back after I leave you."</p>

<p>She seemed very interested. "Perhaps your head is not so sick
after all," she said. "Even my father never thought of anything
like that."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have to if he can find his way about as easily as
you Pellucidarians can," von Horst reminded her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not always so easy to find our way any place except
to our own countries," she explained. "Take us anywhere in
Pellucidar and we can find our way home, but we might not be able
to find our way back again to the place we had been taken. With
your method, we could. I shall have to tell this to my
father."</p>

<p>As they penetrated more deeply into the forest, von Horst was
impressed by its strangely somber and gloomy atmosphere. The
dense foliage of the tree tops formed an unbroken roof above
their heads, shutting out all direct rays of the sun. The result
was a perpetual twilight, with a temperature considerably lower
than any he had experienced in the open&mdash;the two combining
to retard the growth of underbrush, so that the ground between
the boles of the trees was almost bare of anything other than a
carpet of dead leaves. What few plants had had the hardihood to
withstand these conditions were almost colorless&mdash;unhealthy,
grotesque appearing forms that but added to the melancholy aspect
of the repellent wood.</p>

<p>From the moment that they entered the forest the ground rose
rapidly until they were climbing a very considerable ascent; then
they suddenly topped a ridge and descended into a ravine, but the
forest continued unbroken as far as they could see.</p>

<p>As La-ja crossed the ravine and started up the farther ascent,
von Horst asked her why she didn't try to find an easier way by
following the ravine down until they reached the end of the
hills.</p>

<p>"I am following a straight line to Lo-har," she replied.</p>

<p>"But suppose you came to a sea?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I would go around it, of course," she replied; "but where I
can go at all, I go in a straight line."</p>

<p>"I hope there are no Alps on our route," he remarked, half
aloud.</p>

<p>"I do not know what Alps are," said La-ja, "but there will be
plenty of other animals."</p>

<p>"There will have to be more animals than we have seen since we
got into this wood," remarked von Horst, "if we are to eat. I
haven't seen even so much as a bird."</p>

<p>"I have noticed that," replied La-ja. "I have also noticed
that there are no fruits or nuts, nor any other edible thing. I
do not like this forest. Perhaps it is the Forest of Death."</p>

<p>"What is the Forest of Death?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of it. My people speak of it. It lies down some
distance from Lo-har. In it live a race of horrible people who
are not like any other people. Perhaps this is it."</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't seen anything so far that could harm us,"
von Horst reassured her.</p>

<p>They had climbed out of the ravine and were on more level
ground. The forest seemed even denser than it had been farther
back. Only a dim, diffused light relieved the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly La-ja stopped. "What was that?" she asked in a
whisper. "Did you see it?"</p>

<p>"I saw something move, but I did not see what it was," replied
the man. "It disappeared among the trees ahead of us and to the
right. Is that what you saw?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was right over there." She pointed. "I do not like
this forest. I do not know why, but it is as though it were
vile&mdash;unclean."</p>

<p>Von Horst nodded. "It is eerie. I shall be glad when we are
well out of it."</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed La-ja. "There it is again. It is all white.
What could it be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I just had the briefest glimpse of it; but I
thought&mdash;I thought it was something almost human. It is so
dark in here that it is difficult to discern objects clearly
unless one is very close to them."</p>

<p>They walked on in silence, keeping a sharp lookout in all
directions; and von Horst noticed that the girl remained very
close to him. Often her shoulder touched his breast as though she
sought the reassurance of personal contact. He was doubly glad
now that he had insisted upon coming with her. He knew that she
would not admit that she was frightened; and he would not suggest
it, but he knew that she was frightened. For some inexplicable
reason&mdash;inexplicable to him&mdash;he was glad that she was.
Perhaps it satisfied the protective instinct in him. Perhaps it
made her seem more feminine, and von Horst liked feminine
women.</p>

<p>They had gone some little distance from the point at which
they had seen the mysterious creature moving among the trees,
without seeing any other suggestion of life in the forest, when
they were startled by a series of shrieks, mingled with which
were roars and a strange hissing sound. They both stopped, and
La-ja pressed close to von Horst. He felt her tremble ever so
slightly; and threw an arm about her, reassuringly. The sounds
were coming rapidly closer. The screams, sounding strangely
human, were filled with terror and despair, rising to a piercing
crescendo of fright. Then the author of them burst into
view&mdash;a naked man, his face distorted by terror. And such a
man! His skin was a dead white, without life or beauty; and his
hair was white. Two great canine tusks curved downward to his
chin, the pink irises of his eyes surrounded blood-red pupils to
make an already repellent countenance still further hideous.</p>

<p>Behind him, hissing and roaring, galloped a small dinosaur. It
was not much larger than a Shetland pony; but its appearance
might easily have caused even the bravest of men misgivings, so
similar was it in everything but size to the mighty Tyrannosaurus
Rex, the king of the tyrant reptiles of the Cretaceous.</p>

<p>At sight of La-ja and von Horst, the dinosaur veered suddenly
in their direction and came hissing and roaring down upon them
like a steam locomotive gone amuck. So close was it that there
was not even time to seek safety behind a tree; and von Horst's
reaction was the natural and almost mechanical one of a man of
his training. He whipped his revolver from its holster and fired;
then he leaped quickly out of the path of the charging brute,
dragging La-ja with him.</p>

<p>The dinosaur, badly hit, roared with rage, nearly going down.
As it stumbled past him, the man fired again, placing a heavy .45
slug just behind the left shoulder. This time the beast fell; but
knowing the remarkable life tenacity of the reptilia, von Horst
was not over confident that all danger was past. Grasping La-ja
by a hand, he ran quickly to the nearest tree, behind the bole of
which they sought concealment. Above them and out of reach were
the lowest branches&mdash;a perfect sanctuary that they could not
gain. If the two bullets had not permanently stopped the
dinosaur, their principal hope lay in the possibility that after
it regained its feet, if it did not immediately see them it would
go blundering off in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>From behind the tree, von Horst watched the beast pawing up
the matted vegetation as it sought to regain its feet. He could
see that it was far from dead, although badly hit. La-ja pressed
close to him. He could feel her heart beating against his side.
It was a tense moment as the dinosaur finally staggered up. For a
moment it swayed as though about to fall again; then it swung
slowly about in a circle, its muzzle raised, sniffing the air.
Presently it started in their direction&mdash;slowly, cautiously.
Its appearance now seemed far more menacing to von Horst than had
its mad charge. It gave the impression of being a cold,
calculating, efficient engine of destruction, an animated
instrument of revenge that would demand an eye for an eye and not
give up the ghost until vengeance had been achieved. It was
coming straight toward the tree behind which they were hiding.
Whether it had discovered the small portion of von Horst's head
that was revealed beyond the edge of the bole, the man did not
know; but it was certainly coming toward them guided either by
sight or by scent.</p>

<p>It was a tense moment for von Horst. For the instant he was
uncertain as to what he should do. Then he decided. Leaning close
to La-ja, he whispered, "The beast is coming. Run for that tree
behind us, keeping this tree between you and the beast, so that
it does not see you; then keep going from one tree to another
until you are safely away. When it is dead I will call to
you."</p>

<p>"And what will you do? Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait here to make sure that it dies," he replied. "I can
give it a few more shots if necessary."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No."</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he urged. "It is quite close. It is looking for
us."</p>

<p>"I shall remain here with you," said La-ja with finality.</p>

<p>From her tone of voice he knew that there was nothing more to
be said. From past experience he knew his La-ja. With a shrug, he
gave up the argument; then he looked out once more to see the
dinosaur within a few paces of the tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaped from behind the tree and started on a run
across the front of the beast. He had acted so quickly that La-ja
was stunned to inaction by surprise. But not the dinosaur. It did
just what von Horst had hoped and believed it would. With a
bellow of rage, it took after him. Thus he drew it away from the
girl. This accomplished, he turned and faced the brute. Standing
his ground, he fired rapidly from his automatic, placing his
bullets in the broad chest. Yet the thing came on.</p>

<p>Von Horst emptied his weapon; the dinosaur was almost upon
him; he saw La-ja running rapidly toward him, as though in an
effort to divert the charge of the infuriated reptile with the
comparatively puny spear that she carried. He tried to leap aside
from the path of the charging beast, but it was too close. It
rose upon its hind feet and struck at his head with a taloned
fore paw, felling him, unconscious, to the ground.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE CHARNEL
CAVES</a></h2>

<p class="first">Von Horst experienced a sensation of peace and
well being. He was vaguely aware that he was awakening from a
long and refreshing sleep. He did not open his eyes. He was so
comfortable that there seemed no reason to do so, but rather to
court a continuance of the carefree bliss he was enjoying. This
passive rapture was rudely interrupted by a growing realization
that his head ached. With returning consciousness his nervous
system awoke to the fact that he was far from comfortable. The
sensation of peace and well being faded as the dream it was. He
opened his eyes and looked up into the face of La-ja, bending
solicitously close above his own. His head was pillowed in her
lap. She was stroking his forehead with a soft palm.</p>

<p>"You are all right, Von?" she whispered. "You will not
die?"</p>

<p>He smiled up at her, wryly. "'O Death! Where is thy sting?'"
he apostrophized.</p>

<p>"It didn't sting you," La-ja assured him; "it hit you with its
paw."</p>

<p>Von Horst grinned. "My head feels as though it had hit me with
a sledge hammer. Where is it? What became of it?" He turned his
head painfully to one side and saw the dinosaur laying motionless
near them.</p>

<p>"It died just as it struck you," explained the girl. "You are
a very brave man, Von."</p>

<p>"You are a very brave girl," he retorted. "I saw you running
in to help me. You should not have done that."</p>

<p>"Could I have stood and watched you being killed when you had
deliberately drawn the charge of the zarith upon yourself to save
me?"</p>

<p>"So that is a zarith?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a baby zarith," replied the girl. "It is well for us
that it was not a full grown one, but of course one would never
meet a full grown zarith in a forest."</p>

<p>"No? Why not?"</p>

<p>"For one reason they are too big; and, then, they couldn't
find any food here. A full grown zarith is eight times as long as
a man is tall. It couldn't move around easily among all these
trees; and when it stood up on its hind feet, it'd bump its head
on the branches. They kill thags and tandors and other large game
that seldom enters the forests&mdash;at least not forests like
this one."</p>

<p>Von Horst whistled softly to himself as he tried to visualize
a reptile nearly fifty feet in length that fed on the great Bos,
the progenitors of modern cattle, and upon the giant mammoth.
"Yes," he soliloquized, "I imagine it's just as well that we ran
into Junior instead of papa. But, say, La-ja, what became of that
man-thing the zarith was chasing?"</p>

<p>"He never stopped running. I saw him looking back after you
made the loud noise with that thing you call peestol; but he did
not stop. He should have come back to help you, I think; though
he must have thought that you were sick in the head not to run.
It takes a very brave man not to run from a zarith."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any place to run. If there had been, I'd still
be running."</p>

<p>"I do not believe that," said La-ja. "Gaz would have run, but
not you."</p>

<p>"You like me a little better, La-ja?" he asked. He was starved
for friendship&mdash;for even the friendship of this savage
little girl of the stone age.</p>

<p>"No," said La-ja, emphatically. "I do not like you at all, but
I know a brave man when I see one."</p>

<p>"Why don't you like me, La-ja?" he asked a little wistfully.
"I like you. I like you&mdash;a lot."</p>

<p>He hesitated. How much did he like her?</p>

<p>"I don't like you because you are sick in the head, for one
thing; for another, you are not of my tribe; furthermore, you try
to order me around as though I belonged to you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure sick in the head now," he admitted; "but that
doesn't effect my good disposition or my other sterling
qualities, and I can't help not being a member of your tribe. You
can't hold that against me. It was just a mistake on the part of
my father and mother in not having been born in Pellucidar; and
really you can't blame them for that, especially when you
consider that they never even heard of the place. And, La-ja, as
for ordering you around; I never do it except for your own
good."</p>

<p>"And I don't like the way you talk sometimes, with a silent
laugh behind your words. I know that you are laughing at
me&mdash;making fun of me because you think that the world you
came from is so much better than Pellucidar&mdash;that its people
have more brains."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that you will ever learn to like me?" he
asked, quite solemn now.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "you will be dead before I could have
time."</p>

<p>"Gaz, I suppose, will attend to that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Gaz, or some other of my people. Do you think you could stand
now?"</p>

<p>"I am very comfortable," he said. "I have never had such a
nice pillow."</p>

<p>She took his head, quite gently, and laid it on the ground;
then she stood up. "You are always laughing at me with words,"
she said.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. "<i>With</i> you, La-ja; never <i>at</i>
you," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily as though meditating his words. She
was attempting, he was sure, to conjure some uncomplimentary
double meaning from them; but she made no comment.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can walk?" was all that she said.</p>

<p>"I don't feel much like dancing even a saraband," he replied,
"but I think I can walk all right. Come on, lead the way to Lo-
har and the lightsome Gaz."</p>

<p>They resumed their journey deeper into the gloomy wood,
speaking seldom as they toiled up the steep ascents that
constantly confronted them. At length they came to a sheer cliff
that definitely blocked their further progress in a straight
line. La-ja turned to the left and followed along its foot. As
she did not hesitate or seem in the slightest doubt, von Horst
asked her why she turned to the left instead of to the right. "Do
you know the shortest way when you cannot go in a straight line?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she admitted; "but when one does not know and cannot
follow one's head, then one should always turn to the left and
follow one's heart."</p>

<p>He nodded, comprehendingly. "Not a bad idea," he said. "At
least it saves one from useless speculation." He glanced up the
face of the cliff, casually measuring its height with his eyes.
He saw the same great trees of the forest growing close to the
edge, indicating that the forest continued on beyond; and he saw
something else&mdash;just a fleeting glimpse of something moving,
but he was sure that he recognized it. "We are being watched," he
said.</p>

<p>La-ja glanced up. "You saw something?" she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "It looked like our white-haired friend, or another
just like him."</p>

<p>"He was not our friend," remonstrated the literal La-ja.</p>

<p>"I was laughing with words, as you say," he explained.</p>

<p>"I wish that I liked you," said La-ja.</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise. "I wish that you did, but why do
you wish it?"</p>

<p>"I would like to like a man who can laugh in the face of
danger," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well, please try; but do you really think that fellow is
dangerous? He didn't look very dangerous when we saw him
presenting the freedom of the forest to the zarith."</p>

<p>She knit her brows and looked at him with a puzzled
expression. "Sometimes you seem quite like other people," she
said; "and then you say something, and I realize that your head
is very sick."</p>

<p>Von Horst laughed aloud. "I opine that the twentieth century
brand of humor doesn't go so well in the Pleistocene."</p>

<p>"There you go again!" she snapped. "Even my father, who is
very wise, would not know what you were talking about half the
time."</p>

<p>As they moved along the foot of the cliff, they kept
constantly alert for any further sign that they were being
watched or followed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that this white-haired man is
dangerous?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He alone might not be dangerous to us: but where there is one
there must be a tribe, and any tribe of strange people would be
dangerous to us. We are in their country. They know the places
where they might most easily set upon us and kill us. We do not
know what is just beyond the range of our vision.</p>

<p>"If this is the Forest of Death, the people who dwell here are
dangerous because they are not as other men. I have heard it
said. None of my people who are living has ever been here, but
stories handed down from father to son tell of strange things
that have happened in the Forest of Death. My people are brave
people, but none of them would go to that forest. There are
things in Pellucidar that warriors cannot fight with weapons. It
is known that there are such things in the Forest of Death. If we
are indeed in it, we shall never live to reach Lo-har."</p>

<p>"Poor Gaz!" exclaimed von Horst.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry for him because he will not have the pleasure of
killing me or taking you for his mate."</p>

<p>She looked at him in disgust, continuing on in silence. They
both watched for signs of the trailers they were sure were
following them; but no sound broke the deathly silence of the
wood, nor did they see aught to confirm their suspicions; so at
length they decided that whatever it was they had seen at the
cliff top had departed and would not molest them.</p>

<p>They came to the mouth of a cave in the cliff; and as they had
not slept for same time, von Horst suggested that they go in and
rest. His head still ached, and he felt the need of sleep. The
mouth of the cave was quite small, making it necessary for von
Horst to get down on his hands and knees and crawl in to
investigate. He shoved his spear in ahead of him and felt around
with it to assure himself that no animal was lairing in the
darkness of the interior as well as to discover if the cave were
large enough to accommodate them.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself on both these points, he entered the
cave; and a moment later La-ja joined him. A cursory exploration
assured them that the cave ran back some little distance into the
cliff, but as they were only interested in enough space wherein
to sleep they lay down close to the entrance. Von Horst lay with
his head to the opening, his spear ready to thrust at any
intruder that might awaken him. La-ja lay a few feet from him
farther back in the cave. It was very dark and quiet. A gentle
draft of fresh air came through the entrance dispelling the damp
and musty odors which von Horst had come to expect in caves. Soon
they were asleep.</p>

<p>When von Horst awoke, his head no longer ached; and he felt
much refreshed. He turned over on his back and stretched,
yawning.</p>

<p>"You are awake?" asked La-ja.</p>

<p>"Yes. Are you rested?"</p>

<p>"Entirely. I just woke up."</p>

<p>"Hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and thirsty, too," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Let's get started, then," he suggested. "It looks as though
we'd have to get out of this forest before we find food."</p>

<p>"All right." she said, "but what makes it so dark out?"</p>

<p>Von Horst got to his knees and faced the entrance to the cave.
He could see nothing. Even the gloom of the forest had been
blotted out. He thought it possible that he had become turned
around in his sleep and was looking in the wrong direction, but
no matter which way he turned he was confronted always by the
same impenetrable blackness. Then he crawled forward, feeling
with his hands. Where he had thought the entrance to be he found
the rounded surface of a large boulder. He felt around its edges,
discovering loose dirt.</p>

<p>"The entrance has been blocked up, La-ja," he said.</p>

<p>"But what could have done it without awakening us?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he admitted, "but in some way the mouth of the
cave has been filled with a boulder and loose dirt. There isn't a
breath of air coming in as there was when we entered."</p>

<p>He tried to push the boulder away, but he could not budge it.
Then he started to scrape away the loose dirt, but what he
scraped away was replaced by more sifting in from the outside.
La-ja came to his side and they exerted their combined weight and
strength in an effort to move the boulder, but to no avail.</p>

<p>"We are penned up here like rats in a trap," said von Horst in
deep disgust.</p>

<p>"And with our air supply shut off we'll suffocate if we don't
find some way to get out."</p>

<p>"There must be another opening," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Don't you recall that when we came in there was a draft of
air entering from the outside?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right; there was."</p>

<p>"Well, if the air came in this entrance in a draft, it must
have gone out some other opening; and if we can find that
opening, perhaps we can get out, too."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the white-haired man and his people blocked
the entrance?" asked La-ja.</p>

<p>"I imagine so," replied von Horst. "It must have been men of
some kind; no animal could have done it so quietly as not to have
awakened us; and, of course, for the same reason, an earthquake
is out of the question."</p>

<p>"I wonder why they did it?" mused the girl.</p>

<p>"Probably an easy and safe way to kill strangers who come to
their country," suggested von Horst.</p>

<p>"Just let us starve to death or suffocate," said the girl in
disgust. "Only cowards would do that."</p>

<p>"I'll bet Gaz would never do anything like that," said von
Horst.</p>

<p>"Gaz? He has killed many men with his bare hands. Sometimes he
bites the great vein in their neck and they bleed to death, and
once he pushed a man's head back until he broke his neck."</p>

<p>"What a nice little play fellow!"</p>

<p>"Gaz never plays. He loves to kill&mdash;that is his
play."</p>

<p>"Well, if I'm going to meet him, I'll have to get out of here.
Let's follow the cave back and see if we can find the other
opening. Stay close behind me." Von Horst rose slowly to gauge
the height of the cave and found that they could stand erect;
then he groped his way cautiously toward the rear, touching a
wall with one hand. He moved very slowly, feeling ahead with each
foot for solid ground before he planted it. They had not gone far
when von Horst felt what appeared to be twigs and leaves beneath
his feet. He stooped and felt of them. They were dry branches
with dead leaves still clinging to them and long thick grasses.
The floor of the cave here was strewn thickly with them.</p>

<p>"Must have been a sleeping place for some animal or perhaps
for men," he suggested. "I wish we had a light; I don't like
groping along in the dark like this."</p>

<p>"I have my fire stones," said La-ja. "If we had some tinder, I
could light a bundle of these grasses."</p>

<p>"I'll make some," said von Horst.</p>

<p>He stooped and cleared a place on the floor, exposing the bare
ground; then he gathered some of the dried leaves and powdered
them between his palms, making a little pile of the tinder on the
bare ground.</p>

<p>"Come and try it, now," he said. "Here," he guided her hand to
the tinder.</p>

<p>La-ja knelt beside him and struck her fire stones together
close above the little single fragment, and it commenced to glow.
La-ja bent low and blew gently upon it. Suddenly it burst into
flame. Von Horst was ready with a bundle of the grasses he had
gathered for the purpose, and a moment later he held a blazing
torch in his hand.</p>

<p>In the light of the torch they looked about them. They were in
a large chamber formed by the widening of the cave. The floor was
littered with twigs and grasses among which were a number of
gnawed bones. Whether it was the den of beasts or men, von Horst
could not tell; but from the presence of the bedding he judged
that it was the latter. Yet there was no article of cast-off
clothing, no broken or discarded weapon or tool that he could
find, no potsherds. If men had dwelt here they must have been of
a very low order.</p>

<p>Before their torch burned low they gathered grasses and made a
quantity of them, and thus supplied with the assurance of light
for a considerable time they continued on through the large
chamber into a narrow corridor that wound and twisted into the
heart of the escarpment. Presently they came to another even
larger chamber. This, too, bore evidence of having been
inhabited; but the relics here were of a grisly nature. The floor
was strewn with the bones and skulls of human beings. A foul odor
of decaying flesh permeated the air of this subterranean charnel
chamber.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"There are three openings beside the one we came in," said La-
ja. "Which one shall we take?"</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head. "We may have to try them all," he
said. "Let's start with the one farthest on our right. It may be
as good a guess as any; and at best it's only a guess, no matter
which one we decide on."</p>

<p>As they approached the opening they were almost overpowered by
the stench that came from it, but von Horst was determined to
investigate every possible avenue of escape; so he stepped
through the opening into a smaller chamber. The sight that met
his eyes brought him to a sudden halt. A dozen human corpses were
piled against the far wall of the chamber. A single glance showed
von Horst that there was no outer opening leading from the room;
so he beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>One of the two remaining openings from the large chamber was
smoke blackened, and on the floor of the cave just in front of it
were the ashes and charcoal of many wood fires. It's appearance
gave von Horst an idea. He walked to the second opening and held
his smoking torch close to it, but the smoke rose steadily; then
he went to that before which fires had been built, and now the
smoke from his torch was drawn steadily into the opening.</p>

<p>"This one must lead to the outer opening," he said, "and it
also served as a chimney when they cooked their feasts. Nice lot,
whoever they are that inhabit these caves. I think I prefer Gaz.
We'll try this one, La-ja."</p>

<p>A narrow corridor rose steeply. It was blackened with soot,
and the draft that wafted continually up it was laden with the
stench from the horror chambers below.</p>

<p>"It can't be far to the top," said von Horst. "The cliff
didn't look more than fifty feet high, and we have been climbing
a little all the time since we first entered the cave."</p>

<p>"It's getting light ahead," said La-ja.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's the opening!" exclaimed von Horst.</p>

<p>Ten feet from the surface they passed the openings to two
corridors or chambers, one on either side of the shaft they were
ascending; but so engrossed were they in escaping from the foul
air that surrounded them that they scarce noticed them. Nor did
they see the forms lurking in the darkness just within.</p>

<p>La-ja was just behind von Horst. It was she who discovered the
danger first&mdash;but too late. She saw hands reach out of one
of the openings just as von Horst passed it, seize him, and drag
him in. She voiced a cry of warning, and at the same instant she
was seized and drawn into the opening on the opposite side.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">X. &mdash; GORBUSES</a></h2>

<p class="first">Von Horst struggled and fought to free himself.
He shouted aloud to La-ja to run to the opening they had seen
ahead of them and make her escape. He did not know that she, too,
had been captured. It seemed that a dozen hands clung to each of
his arms, and though he was a powerful man he could neither
escape nor wrench his arm free long enough to draw his pistol.
His spear had been snatched from him at the moment of his
seizure. It was very dark in the corridor down which he was being
dragged along a steep declivity; so that he could not see whether
they were men or beasts that had captured him. Yet, though they
did not speak, he was sure that they were men. Presently, at a
sudden turning of the corridor, they came into a lighted
chamber&mdash;a vast subterranean room illuminated by many
torches. And here von Horst saw the nature of the creatures into
whose hands he had fallen. They were of the same race as the man
he had seen fleeing from the zanth. They were mostly men; but
there were a few women among them and perhaps a dozen children.
All had white skins, white hair, and the pink and red eyes of
Albinos, which in themselves are not disgusting. It was the
bestial, brutal faces of these creatures that made them appear so
horrible.</p>

<p>Most of the assemblage, which must have numbered several
hundred people, sat or squatted or lay near the wall of the
roughly circular chamber, leaving a large open space in the
center. To this space von Horst was dragged; then he was thrown
to the ground, his hands tied behind his back, and his ankles
secured.</p>

<p>As he lay on his side, taking in all that he could see of the
repulsive concourse, his heart suddenly sank. From the mouth of a
corridor opposite that through which he had been brought into the
chamber he saw La-ja being dragged. They brought her to the open
space where he lay and bound her as they had bound him. The two
lay facing one another. Von Horst tried to smile, but there was
not much heart in it. From what he had seen of these people and
what he had guessed of their customs, he could draw no slightest
ray of hope that they might escape a fate similar to that of
those whose ghastly remains they had seen in those other two
chambers of the cave.</p>

<p>"It looks like a hard winter," he said.</p>

<p>"Winter? What is winter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It is the time of year&mdash;oh, but then you don't even know
what a year is. What's the use? Let's talk about something
else."</p>

<p>"Why do we have to talk?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why I have to, but I do. Ordinarily I'm not a
very loquacious person, but right now I've got to talk or go
crazy."</p>

<p>"Be careful what you say, then," she whispered, "if you are
thinking of talking of a way to escape."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose these things can understand us?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can understand you," said one of the creatures
standing near them, in hollow, sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>"Then tell us why you captured us. What are you going to do
with us?"</p>

<p>The fellow bared his yellowed teeth in a soundless laugh. "He
asks what we are going to do with them," he announced in loud
tones that were none the less suggestive of the grave because of
their loudness.</p>

<p>The audience rocked with silent mirth. "What are we going to
do with them?" echoed several, and then they went off into gales
of hideous, mirthless laughter that was as silent as the
tomb.</p>

<p>"If they want to know, lets show them now," suggested one.</p>

<p>"Yes, Torp," said another, "now, now."</p>

<p>"No," said he who had been addressed as Torp, the same fellow
who had originally spoken to von Horst. "We already have plenty,
many of which have aged too long as it is." He stepped closer to
the prisoners; and, stooping, pinched their flesh, digging a
filthy forefinger between their ribs. "They need fattening," he
announced. "We shall feed them for a while. Plenty of nuts and a
little fruit will put a layer of juicy fat on their ribs." He
rubbed his palms together and licked his flabby lips. "Some of
you take them away and put them in that little room over there,
get nuts and fruit for them; and keep them there until they get
fat." As he finished speaking, another of the creatures entered
the room from one of the runways that led above. He was very much
excited as he ran into the center of the cavern.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Durg?" demanded Torp.</p>

<p>"I was chased by a zarith," exclaimed Durg, "but that is not
all. A strange gilak with a woman made many loud noises with a
little black stick, and the zarith fell down and died. The
strange gilak saved Durg's life; but why, I do not know."</p>

<p>The men who had gathered about von Horst and La-Ja to take
them to the chamber in which they were to be fattened had removed
the thongs from their ankles and dragged them to their feet just
as Durg finished his story; so that he saw them now for the first
time.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he exclaimed excitedly. "There is the same
gilak that saved Durg's life. What are you going to do with them,
Torp?"</p>

<p>"They are going to be fattened," replied Torp; "they are too
thin."</p>

<p>"You should let them go, because they saved my life," urged
Durg.</p>

<p>"Should I let them go because the man is a fool?" demanded
Torp. "If he had any sense he would have killed and eaten you.
Take them away."</p>

<p>"He saved a Gorbus!" cried Durg, addressing the assembled
tribe. "Should we let him be killed for that? I say, let them go
free."</p>

<p>"Let them go!" cried a few, but there were more who shrieked,
"Fatten them! Fatten them!"</p>

<p>As the men were pushing them toward the entrance to the
chamber in which they were to be confined, von Horst saw Durg
facing Torp angrily.</p>

<p>"Some day I am going to kill you," threatened the former. "We
need a good chief. You are no good."</p>

<p>"I am chief," screamed Torp. "It is I who will kill you."</p>

<p>"You?" demanded Durg with disgust. "You are only a killer of
women. You murdered seven of them. You never murdered a man. I
murdered four."</p>

<p>"You poisoned them," sneered Torp.</p>

<p>"I did not!" shrieked Durg. "I killed three of them with a
cleaver and stabbed the other with a dagger."</p>

<p>"In the back?" asked Torp.</p>

<p>"No, not in the back, you woman killer." As von Horst was
pushed from the large cavern into the darkness of the small one
that adjoined it the two Gorbuses were still quarrelling; and as
the European meditated upon what he had heard, he was struck not
so much by the gruesomeness of their words as by Durg's use of
two English words&mdash;cleaver and dagger.</p>

<p>This was sufficiently remarkable in itself, and even more so
coming from the lips of a member of a tribe that was apparently
so low in the scale of evolution that they had no weapons of any
description. How could Durg know what a dagger was? How could he
ever have heard of a cleaver? And where did he learn the English
words for them? Von Horst could discover no explanation of the
mystery.</p>

<p>The Gorbuses left them in the smaller cave without bothering
to secure their ankles again, though they left their hands tied
behind them. There were leaves and grasses on the floor, and the
two prisoners made themselves as comfortable as they could. The
torch-light from the larger cave relieved the gloom of their
prison cell, permitting them to see one another dimly as they sat
on the musty bedding that littered the floor.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now?" demanded La-ja.</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything that we can do right now," replied
the man, "but it appears that later on we are going to be
eaten&mdash;when we are fatter. If they feed us well we should do
our best to get fat. We must certainly leave a good impression
behind us when we go."</p>

<p>"That is stupid," snapped the girl. "Your head must be very
sick indeed to think of anything so stupid."</p>

<p>"Perhaps 'thick' would be a better word," laughed von Horst.
"Do you know, La-ja, it is just too bad."</p>

<p>"What is too bad?"</p>

<p>"That you have no sense of humor," he replied. "We could have
a much better time if you had."</p>

<p>"I never know when you are serious and when you are laughing
with words," she said. "If you will tell me when the things you
say are supposed to be funny, perhaps I can laugh at them."</p>

<p>"You win, La-ja," the man assured her.</p>

<p>"Win what?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"My apology and my esteem&mdash;you have a sense of humor,
even though you don't know it."</p>

<p>"You said a moment ago," said La-ja, "that you didn't know of
anything that we could do right now. Don't you wish to escape, or
would you rather stay here and get eaten?"</p>

<p>"Of course I'd prefer escaping," replied von Horst, "but I
don't see any possibility of it at present while all those
creatures are in the big cave."</p>

<p>"What have you got that thing you call peestol for?" demanded
La-ja, not without a note of derision. "You killed a zarith with
it. You could much more easily kill these Gorbuses; then we could
escape easily."</p>

<p>"There are too many of them, La-ja," he replied. "If I fired
away all my ammunition, I could not possibly kill enough of them
to make escape certain; furthermore my hands are tied behind me.
But even were they free, I'd wait to the very last moment before
attempting it.</p>

<p>"You have no way of knowing it, La-ja; but when I have used up
all these shiny little things tucked in my belt, the pistol will
be of no more use to me; for I can never get any more of them.
Therefore, I must be very careful not to waste them.</p>

<p>"However, you may rest assured that before I'll let 'em eat
either one of us, I'll do a little shooting. My hope is that they
will be so surprised and frightened by the reports that they'll
fall over one another in their efforts to escape."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a Gorbus entered their little cave. It
was Durg. He carried a small torch which illuminated the
interior, revealing the rough walls, the litter of leaves and
grasses, the two figures lying uncomfortably with bound
hands.</p>

<p>Durg looked them over in silence for a moment; then he
squatted on the floor near them. "Torp is a stubborn fool," he
said in his hollow voice. "He ought to set you free, but he
won't. He's made up his mind that we're going to eat you, and I
guess we shall.</p>

<p>"It's too bad though. No one ever saved a Gorbus's life
before; it was unheard of. If I had been chief, I would have let
you go."</p>

<p>"Maybe you can help us anyway," suggested von Horst.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Durg.</p>

<p>"Show us how we can escape."</p>

<p>"You can't escape," Durg assured him emphatically.</p>

<p>"Those people don't stay in that other cave all the time, do
they?" demanded the European.</p>

<p>"If they go away, Torp will leave a guard here to see that you
don't get away."</p>

<p>Von Horst mused for a moment. Finally he looked up at their
grotesque visitor. "You'd like to be chief, wouldn't you?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" cautioned Durg. "Don't let anyone hear you say that.
But how did you know?"</p>

<p>"I know many things," replied von Horst in a whisper,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>Durg eyed him half fearfully. "I knew that you were not as
other gilaks," he said. "You are different. Perhaps you are from
that other life, that other world, of which Gorbuses get fleeting
glimpses out of the dim background of almost forgotten memories.
Yes, they are forgotten; and yet there are always reminders of
them constantly tormenting us. Tell me&mdash;who are you? From
whence came you?"</p>

<p>"I am called Von; and I come from the outer world&mdash;from a
world very different from this one."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" exclaimed Durg. "It must be that there is another
world. Once we Gorbuses lived in it. It was a happy world; but
because of what we did we were sent away from it to live here in
this dark forest, miserable and unhappy."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said von Horst. "You didn't come from
my world; there is no one like you there."</p>

<p>"We were different there," said Durg. "We all feel that we
were different. To some the memories are more distinct than to
others, but they are never wholly clear. We get fleeting glimpses
that are blurred and dim and that fade quickly before we can
decipher them or fix them definitely in our memories. It is only
those that we murdered that we see clearly&mdash;we see them and
the way that we murdered them; but we do not see ourselves as we
were then, except rarely; and then the visions are only hazy
suggestions. But we know that we were not as we are here. It is
tantalizing; it drives us almost to madness&mdash;never quite to
see, never quite to recall.</p>

<p>"I can see the three that I killed with the cleaver&mdash;my
father and two older brothers&mdash;I did it that I might get
something they had; I do not know what. They stood in my way. I
murdered them. Now I am a naked Gorbus feeding on human bodies.
Some of us think that thus we are punished."</p>

<p>"What do you know about cleavers?" asked von Horst, now much
interested in the weird recital and its various implications.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of cleavers except that it was with a cleaver
I killed my father and my two brothers. With a dagger, I stabbed
a man. I do not know why. I can see him&mdash;his pain distorted
features clearly, the rest of him very vaguely. He had on blue
clothes with shiny buttons. Ah, now he has faded away&mdash;all
but his face. He is glaring at me. I almost had something
then&mdash;clothes, buttons! What are they? I almost
knew&mdash;now they are gone. What were the words? What words did
I just say? They have gone, too. It is ever thus. We are plagued
by half pictures that are snatched away from us immediately."</p>

<p>"You all suffer thus?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Durg. "We all see those we have murdered; those
are the only memories that we retain permanently."</p>

<p>"You are all murderers?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am one of the best. Torp's seven women are nothing.
Some he killed while they were embracing him with love&mdash;he
smothered them or choked them. One he strangled with her own
hair. He is always bragging about that one."</p>

<p>"Why did he kill them?" demanded La-ja.</p>

<p>"He wished something that they had. It was thus with all of
us. I can't imagine what it was I wished when I killed my father
and brothers, nor what any of the others wished. Whatever it was,
we didn't get it; for we have nothing here. The only thing we
ever crave is food, and we have plenty of that. Anyway, no one
would kill for food. It gives no satisfaction. It is nauseating.
We eat because if we didn't we believe that we would die and go
to a worse place than this. We are afraid of that."</p>

<p>"You don't enjoy eating?" asked von Horst. "What do you
enjoy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. There is no happiness in the Forest of Death. There
are cold and hopelessness and nausea and fear. Oh, yes; there is
hate. We hate one another. Perhaps we get some satisfaction from
that, but not a great deal. We are all hating, and you can't get
a great deal of pleasure doing what every one else is doing.</p>

<p>"I derived a little pleasure from wishing to set you
free&mdash;that was different; that was unique. It is the first
pleasure I have ever had. Of course I am not certain just what
pleasure is, but I thought I recognized the sensation as pleasure
because while I was experiencing it I forgot all about cold and
hopelessness and nausea and fear. Anything that makes one forget
must be a pleasure."</p>

<p>"You are all murderers?" asked La-ja.</p>

<p>"We have each killed something," replied Durg. "Do you see
that old woman sitting over there with her face in her hands? She
killed the happiness of two people. She remembers it quite
clearly. A man and a woman. They loved each other very much. All
that they asked was to be left alone and allowed to be happy.</p>

<p>"And that man standing just beyond her. He killed something
more beautiful than life. Love. He killed his wife's love.</p>

<p>"Yes, each of us has killed something; but I am glad that it
was men that I killed and not happiness or love."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said von Horst. "There are far too
many men in the world but not half enough happiness or love."</p>

<p>A sudden commotion in the outer cave interrupted further
conversation. Durg jumped to his feet and left them; and von
Horst and La-ja, looking out, saw two prisoners being dragged
into the cavern.</p>

<p>"More food for the larder," remarked the man.</p>

<p>"And they don't even enjoy eating it," said La-ja. "I wonder
if what Durg told us is true&mdash;about the murders, I mean, and
the other life they half recall."</p>

<p>Von Horst shook his head. "I don't know; but if it is, it
answers a question that has been bothering generations of men of
the outer crust."</p>

<p>"Look," said La-ja. "They are bringing the prisoners this
way."</p>

<p>"To the fattening pen," said von Horst with a grin.</p>

<p>"One of them is a very big man, is he not?" remarked La-ja.
"It takes many Gorbuses to force him along."</p>

<p>"That fellow looks familiar to me," said von Horst. "Not the
big one&mdash;the other. There are so many Gorbuses around them
that I can't get a good look at either of them."</p>

<p>The new prisoners were brought to the smaller cave and thrust
in roughly, so that they almost fell upon the two already there.
The larger man was blustering and threatening; the other whined
and complained. In the semi-darkness of the interior it was
impossible to distinguish the features of either.</p>

<p>They paid no attention to von Horst or La-ja although they
must have been aware of their presence; yet the former felt
certain that the loud bragging of the larger man must be for the
purpose of impressing them, as the Gorbuses had departed; and the
fellow's companion did not appear to be the type that anyone
would wish to impress. He was quite evidently a coward and in a
blue funk of terror. He was almost gibbering with fright as he
bemoaned the fate that had ever brought him to the Forest of
Death; but the other man paid no attention to him, each rambling
on quite independently of the other.</p>

<p>As von Horst, half amused, listened to them, several Gorbuses
approached the cave, bearing fruits and nuts. One of them carried
a torch, the light from which illuminated the interior of the
cave as the fellow entered; and in the flickering light, the
faces of the prisoners were revealed to each other.</p>

<p>"You!" fairly screamed the big fellow who had been blustering,
as his eyes fell upon von Horst. It was Frug, and his companion
was Skruf.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">XI. &mdash; FATTENED FOR
SLAUGHTER</a></h2>

<p class="first">As the full significance of the situation
revealed itself to von Horst, he was of two minds as to whether
he should laugh or curse. Their predicament had been bad enough
before, but with the presence of these two it might be infinitely
worse. Frug's reaction when he recognized them augured no good.
However, if the situation was menacing it was also amusing; and
von Horst smiled as he contemplated the excitement of the massive
cave man.</p>

<p>"And the girl, too!" exclaimed Skruf.</p>

<p>"Yes," said von Horst, "it is indeed we. To what do we owe the
pleasure of this unexpected visit? We had thought of you as being
safely beside the home fires of Basti cooking your meat, and here
you are waiting to be cooked as someone else's meat! Ah, but is
not life filled with surprises? Some pleasurable,
some&mdash;er&mdash;not so pleasurable."</p>

<p>"If I could break these bonds and get my hands on you!"
shouted Frug.</p>

<p>"Yes? What would you do then, my man?" inquired von Horst.</p>

<p>"I'd break your neck; I'd pound your face to a pulp;
I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," begged von Horst. "Permit me to suggest a different
order of procedure. If you were to break my neck first, as you
intimate is your intention; you would derive little pleasure from
beating my face to a pulp, as I should be dead and therefore
unable to appreciate what you were doing to me. Really, Frug, you
are not very bright. I cannot conceive how a person of such
limited intelligence ever came to be chosen chief of Basti, but
perhaps you were chosen because of the circumference of your
biceps rather than for that of your cranium."</p>

<p>The Gorbuses had dumped a quantity of fruit and nuts upon the
floor of the cave and departed, leaving the cavern again in semi-
darkness. Frug was still struggling with his bonds. Skruf was
whimpering and moaning. Von Horst was contemplating the food. "We
can negotiate the softer fruit with our hands tied behind us," he
remarked to La-ja, "but how do they expect us to crack the shells
of some of those nuts."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can free our hands," suggested the girl. "Roll
over close to me, with your back against mine; then try to untie
the thongs that bind my wrists. If you can free me, I can easily
free you."</p>

<p>She had spoken in a low whisper lest Frug or Skruf hear and
act upon the suggestion before she and von Horst were free. The
European wriggled his body into position behind that of the girl;
then he fell to work upon the knots at her wrists. It was a slow
process, partially because he could not see what he was doing and
partially because of the limited use he had of his hands; but
after what seemed an eternity he felt a knot loosening. With
practice he became more adept, and soon the second knot gave to
his perseverance. There were several more; but eventually the
last one succumbed, and La-ja's hands were free. Immediately she
rolled over, facing his back; and he could feel her nimble
fingers searching out the secret of the knots. When she touched
his hands or arms he experienced a strange thrill that was new to
him. He had felt the contact of her flesh before but always then
she had been angry and resentful, sometimes violently so; and he
had experienced no pleasurable reaction. Now it was different;
because, for the first time, she was ministering to him and of
her own free will.</p>

<p>"What are you two doing?" demanded Frug. "You are very quiet.
If you think you are going to eat all the food they brought, I'll
tell you you'd better not. I'll kill you if you try that."</p>

<p>"Before or after you break my neck?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"Before, of course," snapped Frug. "No, after. No&mdash;what
difference does it make? You talk like a fool."</p>

<p>"And after you have killed me and broken my neck, or broken my
neck and killed me, in whichever order you finally decide to
proceed, you and Skruf will undoubtedly eat the food. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>"Of course you're right," growled Frug.</p>

<p>"And do you know the purpose for which the food is intended?"
inquired von Horst.</p>

<p>"For us to eat, of course."</p>

<p>"But why should they care whether or not we eat?" asked the
European. "Are you laboring under the delusion that they are at
all concerned about either our happiness or our comfort?"</p>

<p>"Then why did they bring it?" demanded Skruf.</p>

<p>"To fatten us," explained von Horst. "It seems that they like
their meat fat, or perhaps I should say that it tastes less
nauseating to them fat and fresh."</p>

<p>"Fatten us? Eat us?" gasped Skruf.</p>

<p>Frug made no comment, but von Horst could see that he was
redoubling his efforts to free himself of his bonds. A moment
later La-ja succeeded in negotiating the last knot, and von Horst
felt the thongs slip from his wrists. He sat up and gathered a
handful of fruit, passing it to La-ja; then he turned to
Frug.</p>

<p>"My hands are free," he said. "I am going to remove your
bonds, and then you can liberate Skruf. You are not going to kill
me. If you try to, I'll kill you. I still have the weapon with
which Skruf has seen me kill many beasts and you have seen some
of your own warriors killed. I am going to set you free for two
reasons. One is, that you may eat. The other is not a very good
reason unless you have more brains than I give you credit for. I
hope for the best, but I am skeptical."</p>

<p>"My brains are all right," growled Frug. "What is your other
reason for setting us free?"</p>

<p>"We are all in the same fix here," von Horst reminded him. "If
we don't escape, we shall be killed and eaten. Working together,
we may be able to escape. If we waste our time trying to kill one
another or trying to keep from being killed, none of us will
escape. Now what do you and Skruf intend to do about it? It is up
to you. I shall free your hands in any event; and I shall kill
you before you can lay your hands on me, if you try to."</p>

<p>[Editor's note: There is no text missing in this ebook. It is
in accord with the "Tandem" edition of 1974. When Frug scratches
his head, in the next paragraph, we must assume that von Horst
freed his hands immediately upon saying, in the previous
paragraph, that he would.]</p>

<p>Frug scratched his head. "I swore to kill you," he said. "You
got me into this trouble. If you hadn't escaped from Basti, I
wouldn't be here. It was while we were tracking you that we were
captured. You killed some of my warriors. You liberated all of
our slaves, and now you ask me not to kill you."</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged, "You are mis-stating the facts," he said.
"I am not asking you not to kill me; I am asking you not to make
me kill you. Frug, while I have this weapon, you haven't a chance
on earth to kill me. Perhaps I should have said a chance in the
earth."</p>

<p>"Promise him, Frug," begged Skruf. "He is right. We can't
escape if we fight among ourselves. At least you and I can't, for
he can kill us both. I have seen him kill with the little black
stick. He does not have to be near the thing he wishes to
kill."</p>

<p>"Very well," Frug finally assented. "We will not try to kill
one another until after we have escaped from these people."</p>

<p>Von Horst moved over to the Chief of Basti and removed the
bonds from his wrists; then Frug released Skruf. All but the
latter immediately fell to eating. Skruf sat apart, his face
resolutely turned away from the food.</p>

<p>"Why don't you eat?" demanded Frug.</p>

<p>"And get fat?" cried Skruf. "The rest of you can get fat and
be eaten, but I shall remain so thin that no one will eat
me."</p>

<p>Time passed, as it must even in a timeless world. They ate and
slept, but von Horst and La-ja never slept at the same
time&mdash;Frug and Skruf had indicated too great an interest in
the pistol. When von Horst slept, La-ja watched. Durg came
occasionally to talk with them. He always appeared friendly, but
he could hold out no hope that they might eventually escape the
fate that Torp had decreed for them.</p>

<p>Von Horst had often wondered where the nuts and fruits came
from with which they were fed, as he had seen no sign of either
in the grim forest he and La-ja had traversed. He had a theory
that perhaps the end of the forest was not far distant, and this
he wished to determine. He had by no means given up hope of
escape. When he asked Durg where the Gorbuses got the food for
them, he was told that it grew at no great distance, near the
edge of the Forest of Death. This was what von Horst was most
anxious to hear. He also learned the direction in which they went
to gather the fruit. But when he attempted to persuade Durg to
assist them in their attempt to escape, he met with flat refusal;
and finally he desisted, being careful to give Durg the
impression that he had wholly abandoned the idea.</p>

<p>The rich nuts, the lack of exercise soon began to show in
added layers of fat. Only Skruf remained noticeably thin,
steadfastly refusing to eat more than enough to sustain life.
Frug put on fat far more rapidly than either von Horst or La-
ja.</p>

<p>Finally Skruf called his attention to it. "They will eat you
first," he prophesied. "You are very fat."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked the chief, feeling of the fold of fat
that encircled his waist. He seemed perturbed. "I thought we were
going to try to escape," he said to von Horst.</p>

<p>"I have been hoping that the Gorbuses would leave for a
while," replied the European, "but only a few of them go away at
a time."</p>

<p>"Most of them are asleep now," remarked La-ja. "Many of their
torches have gone out."</p>

<p>"That's right," said von Horst, looking out into the other
chamber. "I've never seen so many of them asleep at one
time."</p>

<p>"I think they have been feeding," said La-ja. "They have been
going out in small parties constantly since I slept last. Perhaps
that is why they are sleepy."</p>

<p>"There go some more torches," whispered von Horst. "There are
only a few burning now."</p>

<p>"And all the rest of the Gorbuses are nodding." La-ja could
not hide her excitement. "If they all fall asleep, we can get
away."</p>

<p>But they did not all sleep. One remained awake, nursing his
torch. It was Torp. Finally he arose and approached the cave
where the prisoners were confined. When they saw him coming they
lay down in such positions as to hide the fact that their hands
were free, as they had in the past whenever a Gorbus came to
their cave. Torp entered, carrying his torch. He looked them over
carefully. Finally he poked Skruf with a foot. "There is no use
waiting for you to get fat," he grumbled. "We will kill you after
this sleep; then we won't have to feed you any more."</p>

<p>"Kill the other first," begged Skruf; "They are much fatter
than I. Give me a chance, and I will get fat."</p>

<p>Torp yawned.</p>

<p>"We'll kill you all at the same time," he said; then he turned
to leave the cave.</p>

<p>Von Horst looked beyond him and saw that every torch in the
outer room was extinguished&mdash;the place lay in utter
darkness. Then he leaped silently to his feet, drawing his pistol
as he did so. Raising the pistol, von Horst struck Torp a single
heavy blow on the skull. Without a sound, the fellow dropped in
his tracks. Von Horst seized his torch.</p>

<p>"Come!" he whispered.</p>

<p>Silently the four ran across the larger cavern to one of the
exits and up the steeply inclined shaft to the corridor that led
to the outer world. As they passed from the dim precincts of the
cavern even the grim and gloomy wood looked fair and lovely by
comparison.</p>

<p>How long they had been imprisoned von Horst could not even
guess, but he felt that it must have been a long time. They had
lost count of sleeps, there had been so many; and they had all,
with the exception of Skruf, put on considerable weight,
indicating that their imprisonment had been of long duration. At
a trot they set off in the direction they believed led to the
nearest edge of the Forest of Death, for they were determined to
put as much distance as possible between themselves and the caves
of the Gorbuses before their escape was discovered.</p>

<p>When in good condition, Pellucidarians can maintain a steady
trot for great distances; but it was not long before all except
Skruf were panting from the exertion&mdash;additional proof that
they had been long confined. At length they were forced to
slacken their gait to a walk.</p>

<p>"When do we commence killing one another, Frug?" inquired von
Horst. "The truce was to last only until we had escaped&mdash;and
we have escaped."</p>

<p>Frug eyed the pistol in its holster and pulled on his beard,
meditatively. "Let us wait until we have left the forest and
separated," he suggested; "then, if we ever meet again, I shall
kill you."</p>

<p>"For your sake let us hope that we never meet again," laughed
von Horst, "but what assurance have I that in the meantime you
and Skruf will honor the agreement? I certainly have no reason to
trust Skruf."</p>

<p>"No one trusts Skruf," replied Frug; "but you have my word
that I will not kill either one of you until after we separate,
and I promise Skruf that I will kill him if he does."</p>

<p>With this loose understanding von Horst had to be satisfied;
but he felt some confidence in Frug's word, because the very
nature of the man seemed to preclude any possibility of duplicity
on his part. He was brutal and savage, but he was also forthright
and candid. If he intended killing you, he climbed to a house top
and screamed it to the world. He was not the sort to sneak up on
a man from behind and stab him in the back&mdash;that was more
like Skruf.</p>

<p>And so they hurried on until, at last, much sooner than they
had expected, the forest thinned, the type of trees changed, and
they came into what seemed a new world. Once again the noon-day
sun beat down upon lush vegetation growing between the boles of
an open forest. Flowers bloomed, birds sang. Presently they saw
an open plain upon which they stood at the outer rim of the
forest land. No sign of pursuit had developed, and the
Pellucidarians were certain that the Gorbuses would never venture
out into the sunlight beyond their gloomy wood.</p>

<p>"They won't follow us here," said Frug. "No man has ever seen
a Gorbus outside the Forest of Death."</p>

<p>"Then lets find a place to sleep," suggested von Horst. "We
need rest. Afterward we can go on until we are ready to
separate."</p>

<p>"Which way do you go?" demanded Frug.</p>

<p>Von Horst looked questioningly at La-ja. "Which way?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The girl pointed out across the plain.</p>

<p>"That is the way I go, too," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"We turn this way," said Frug, pointing to the left. "We shall
skirt the forest until we can pass around it. I will never enter
the Forest of Death again."</p>

<p>"Then after we have slept we separate," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Frug. "I hope that we shall meet again soon,
that I may kill you."</p>

<p>"When you get an idea into that thick skull of yours, you
certainly stick to it," commented von Horst with a grin.</p>

<p>"We will look for a place to sleep," announced the Bastian.
"There may be caves in this cliff."</p>

<p>They discovered a place where they could descend the
escarpment, and on a natural ledge they found an outjutting
stratum beneath which erosion had worn a large niche in which a
dozen men might have found shelter from the hot rays of the
sun.</p>

<p>"You sleep first, La-ja," said von Horst, "and I will
watch."</p>

<p>"I am not sleepy," she replied. "You sleep. I have slept since
you."</p>

<p>It was a bare rock that von Horst stretched out upon, such a
bed as some far distant forebear might have found good but it was
a far cry from box springs and hair mattresses. Yet so quickly
had the man sloughed the last veneer of civilization and reverted
to some primordial type, he seemed quite content with the naked
rock; and in a moment he was asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke he felt that he must have slept for a long time,
so thoroughly rested and refreshed was he. He stretched
luxuriously before turning over to greet La-ja and see if the
others were awake. When he did turn, he found himself alone. Frug
and Skruf were gone and La-ja, too.</p>

<p>He stepped to the edge of the shelf before the cave and looked
out across the plain and to the left and to the right. There was
no one in sight. He thought at first that La-ja had run away from
him, and then it occurred to him that Frug and Skruf had stolen
her. Anger and resentment swelled in his bosom at the duplicity
of the Bastian chief in whose word he had trusted, and then of a
sudden a new thought came to him. After all, had Frug broken his
pledge? He had only promised not to kill; he had not promised not
to abduct!</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">XII. &mdash; MAMMOTH
MEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">From the foot of the cliff where the cave lay,
the plain stretched away knee deep in lush grasses; and from his
position above, von Horst saw where a new trail had been recently
trampled toward the left. That was the direction which Frug had
said he and Skruf would take to avoid the Forest of Death on
their return to Basti. The grass was not trampled out across the
plain in the direction of Lo-har; there was just the one plain
trail toward the left&mdash;a trail that would be easy to follow
as long as it ran through the deep grass. Von Horst wished that
he knew how long he had slept, so that he might have some idea of
the start the abductors had; for he was certain that they were
abductors. It was inconceivable that La-ja would have accompanied
them back to Basti voluntarily. The trail appeared quite plain
from above, but when he reached the foot of the cliff he saw that
it was not so apparent. A close examination showed that only the
grasses that had been actually crushed and broken by the passage
of the three remained down to mark the trail; all others had
returned to their normal positions. It was this discovery that
gave von Horst greatest concern, as it seemed to indicate that
the two men and the girl were far ahead of him.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliff there were some indications of a
struggle. The grasses here had been crushed and broken over a
considerable area. The man could visualize what had taken place.
La-ja had tried to break away from her captors and had probably
put up a good fight, but finally she had been overcome and
carried away.</p>

<p>He stood looking along that dim trail that led away into a new
unknown. It led away from Sari, to what unknown dangers he could
not even guess. Should he follow it? And for what? There was
little likelihood that he could overtake the three; and if they
reached Basti, none that he could rescue the girl. Why should he
wish to risk his life in an attempt to save her&mdash;an attempt
that was almost certain to fail? She disliked him. She had not
taken even decent precautions to hide the fact. And if he did
rescue her it would be only to be killed by her savage fellow
tribesmen for his pains. He thought of Gaz, the terrible man who
crushed lives out with his bare hands.</p>

<p>Were he to turn in the opposite direction he might skirt that
end of the forest and pick up Dangar's trail. The thought of
Dangar and the pleasurable anticipation of the friendly welcome
awaiting him in Sari filled him with longing. He desired
companionship; he longed to feel the warmth of a friend's hand
again, to see the light, of a friendly smile. He was tired of
indifference, and enmity, and hatred. With a sigh, he turned back
and followed the dim trail toward the left. Off there somewhere
in the distance was a little figure with a wealth of golden hair,
perhaps an <i>ignis fatuus</i> luring him to his doom.</p>

<p>"I wonder why I do it," he said half aloud; and then he
shrugged his shoulders and swung on into the unknown.</p>

<p>Profiting by past experience and the schooling he had received
from Dangar, he kept in mind constantly the necessity of
directing his steps so that he would never be too far from some
haven of safety were he threatened by any of the savage creatures
that haunt the Pellucidarian scene. Trees were the prime factor
in his defensive strategy. Never before had trees loomed so large
in his consciousness, and all too often did he have to seek
sanctuary among their branches. Now it would be a huge cave lion
that drove him to shelter; again a mighty tarag, or some fearsome
reptile of a forgotten age.</p>

<p>Along the route that he followed he found the places that Frug
and Skruf and La-ja had slept; and here he slept, too. For food
he had the eggs of birds and reptiles, fruits that grew upon some
of the trees or bushes along his route, and various edible tubers
that Dangar or La-ja had taught him to find and recognize. He
made fire as had his primitive progenitors who trod the outer
crust with the bos and the cave bear, and he took the time to
fashion a new bow and arrows that he might have meat without
wasting his precious ammunition. A sturdy spear he fashioned,
too, its tip fire hardened as were the tips of his arrows.</p>

<p>He tried to make up for the time thus lost by pushing on
throughout the endless day until utter exhaustion forced him to
halt for sleep. Often, between his own sleeps, he passed one and
sometimes two of the sleeping places of those he pursued; and
this assurance that he was gaining on them heartened him and
spurred him on, yet there were times when his quest seemed
utterly hopeless and discouragement sat heavily upon him. The
great forest seemed to run on interminably, but at last it ended
at the foot of a transverse range of rough hills. Here he had
difficulty in following the trail, for the ground was no longer
carpeted with tall grass but was oftentimes hard and stony.</p>

<p>Beyond the hills stretched another rolling plain through which
wound a large river. He viewed it first from the summit of the
pass that he had followed through the hills along an ancient
trail worn deep by the feet of men and beasts through countless
ages. There was a fringe of forest along the river and little
patches of wood scattered about the plain which stretched away to
his right to merge in the distance with what seemed the blue of
an ocean. Ahead of him, far away, another forest bounded the
plain upon that side, while to his left the hills curved around
to meet the forest in the distance. Game dotted the landscape as
far as the eye could reach. In the nearer foreground he could
distinguish bos and red deer, antelopes, tapirs, sheep, and
several species of herbivorous dinosaurs; while at the edge of
the forest skirting the river he made out the huge forms of
mammoths and giant sloths. It was a scene of such primitive
beauty and interest that von Horst stood spellbound for several
minutes, fascinated by its loveliness. For the moment he forgot
everything but the scene below him; but presently his empty belly
recalled him to the realities of life; so that it was no aesthete
that crept silently down toward the plain, but a primitive hunter
of the stone age. He followed the stream when he reached the foot
of the hills, taking advantage of the cover offered by the trees
that bordered it. He thought that he might get a sheep, several
of which were grazing close to the fringing trees; but he knew
how wary they were and how difficult to stalk.</p>

<p>The river wound in great loops, and to save time he took short
cuts across the low hillocks which the river skirted in its wide
bends like a great serpent gliding smoothly toward the sea. While
he was below the summits of the hillocks he could not see the
sheep, nor they him; yet he moved always cautiously since he
never knew what dangers might confront him upon the hillocks'
opposite slopes, for the country was game filled; and where the
herbivores are, there also are the flesh eaters.</p>

<p>As he topped one little hill he saw that which brought him to
a sudden halt&mdash;a great, hairy mammoth lying upon its side
moaning. It lay upon a small level flat beside the river at which
was evidently a watering place or a ford, and not its moaning
alone proclaimed that it was suffering but the agonized trembling
of its huge bulk as well. Notwithstanding the fact that von Horst
knew that these mighty beasts might be highly dangerous, there
was ordinarily such a sweet placidity in their appearance and
such a suggestion of dependability and intelligence in their
great bulk and dignified mien that he was wont to be lulled into
a feeling of security in their presence; and there had been
aroused within him a considerable fondness and respect for these
shaggy progenitors of the modern elephant.</p>

<p>To see one suffering thus filled him with compassion; and
though his better judgment warned him against it, he could not
resist the urge to approach more closely and investigate; though
what he might accomplish was doubtless scarcely more than a
nebulous conjecture in his mind. As he came closer the small eyes
of the pachyderm discovered him; and it raised its head and
trumpeted angrily, but it made no effort to rise. Thus assured
that it was helpless, von Horst came close and examined it; and
as he did so he discovered numerous sharp pointed splinters of
bamboo protruding an inch or so above the surface of the mud, in
which the beast lay at the river's edge; so that he had to move
with great care to avoid stepping on them.</p>

<p>Almost immediately he saw the cause of the beast's
helplessness and suffering&mdash;several of these splinters were
imbedded in the sole of each great pad; so that the creature
could not stand without suffering extreme agony. It was evident
that the sharp stakes had been planted by men; and the purpose of
them was quite apparent; for how more easily could men of the old
stone age, with their primitive weapons, bring down the giant
mammoth and render it helpless that they might dispatch it in
safety?</p>

<p>The presence of the stakes suggested the proximity of men, and
von Horst had already had sufficient evidence to convince him
that all men in this savage world were enemies; yet, though he
looked carefully in all directions, he saw no sign that any were
about; then he turned his attention once more to the beast and
its predicament. If he could remove the splinters and permit the
mammoth to arise what might he expect from the pain racked
creature? Von Horst ran his fingers through his hair dubiously;
then the beast moaned again and so piteously that the man,
casting discretion to the winds, decided to do what he could to
assuage its suffering.</p>

<p>As he started to pick his way among the splinters closer to
those huge pads, he realized that the beast would only be impaled
upon others the moment it arose after he had removed those that
it had already collected; so he set to work to pick the sharpened
stakes from the ground over the entire area that they covered, a
strip about twenty feet wide across the trail leading to the
river; and as he worked, the eyes of the mammoth were on him
constantly, watching his every move.</p>

<p>As he worked near the great beast's head he noticed a patch of
white hair the width of a man's hand growing down the side of the
animal's cheek. He had seen many mammoths, but he had never seen
one similarly marked. It gave the beast a strange, patriarchal
expression, as though he wore an enormous white sideburn. Von
Horst noted the strange marking casually as he went about his
work, but his principal interest was centered on speculation as
to what the gigantic beast would do when it was able to rise.
Some of the stakes were planted within reach of the mighty trunk;
but the man gathered these, as he did the others, apparently
unconcerned by the risk he took. And always the little eyes
watched his every move, but whether in sullen hate or wary
curiosity he could not guess.</p>

<p>At length came the time when all the stakes that he could
locate had been removed, and the next were those embedded in the
great pads. Without a moment's hesitation von Horst walked to the
hind feet of the pachyderm and, one by one, drew out the
torturing slivers. Then he moved to the front feet, well within
reach of the sinuous trunk and the great, curving tusks.
Methodically, he commenced to remove the slivers from the fore
pads, the powerful trunk weaving above him like a huge
serpent.</p>

<p>He felt it touch him, the moist tip of it gliding over his
naked body. It encircled him, but he paid no attention to it. He
had invited death by a humane gesture, and he was game. The trunk
wrapped about his torso&mdash;gently, almost caressingly. It did
not tighten; it did not interfere with his work; yet he sensed it
might close instantly at the slightest false move on his part.
Death seemed very close.</p>

<p>When he had removed the last sliver he stood slowly erect. For
a moment he waited; then, very gently, he laid hold of the trunk
and sought to push it from him. There was no resistance. He moved
unhurriedly, with great deliberation; yet he was under high
nervous strain. At last he stood free and moved slowly away. He
did not stop, but continued on along the river in the direction
he had been going when he discovered the mammoth. For a moment he
was obsessed by a powerful urge to run&mdash;to put as much
distance between himself and the beast as he could before it
regained its feet; but he did not. Instead, he moved on slowly,
nonchalantly, casting an occasional glance behind him.</p>

<p>The beast lay quiet for a moment; then slowly it commenced to
raise its bulk from the ground. Tentatively, it tried bearing its
weight on its front feet; and it stood thus for a moment; then it
rose and stood with all four feet on the ground. It took a few
steps. Evidently its feet did not pain it greatly. It raised its
trunk and trumpeted; then it moved off on the trail of the
man.</p>

<p>At first, von Horst argued to himself that it was not
following him and that presently it would turn aside and go about
its own affairs, but it did not&mdash;it came steadily after him
at a speed considerably in excess of that at which von Horst was
walking. The man shrugged resignedly. What a sentimental fool he
had been! He might have known that this savage beast could not
feel gratitude. He should have left it alone or put it out of its
misery with a single well placed bullet. Now it was too late.
Presently it would overtake him and toss him. Such were his
thoughts as he walked slowly along the trail. Overtake him it
did. The sinuous trunk wrapped suddenly about him and he was
lifted from the ground.</p>

<p>"This," thought von Horst, "is the end." The mammoth stopped
and passed him back to its right side where it placed him on the
ground; but it still let its trunk rest lightly about him,
holding him facing its side; and what von Horst saw there awoke
within him a realization of the sagacity of the animal, for this
side, upon which it had lain, was thickly studded with bamboo
slivers such as he had plucked from his feet. It wished the man
to remove them as he had removed those others.</p>

<p>Von Horst breathed a sigh of relief as he set about his work,
and when it was completed he once again moved on along the trail
he had been following. From the tail of an eye he saw the mammoth
swing about in its tracks and depart in the opposite direction.
In a few moments it was lost to sight. The man felt that he was
well out of a nasty situation that what he described to himself
as maudlin sentimentality had gotten him into. But now that it
was well over and he had seen the last of the great beast he was
glad that he had gone to its aid.</p>

<p>His hunger, momentarily forgotten, manifested itself once more
as he started to stalk the sheep again. From the summit of a rise
he saw them, and again he was the primitive huntsman of the
Pleistocene. Only a cartridge belt and a forty-five
differentiated him in appearance from his progenitors of the
stone age. From the next rise of ground that he mounted he saw
the sheep again, much closer now; but he saw something else, far
to the right across the river. At first glance he thought it only
a herd of mammoths moving down a gently sloping plain from the
foot-hills, coming toward the river; but instantly he recognized
the truth&mdash;astride the neck of each of the great beasts rode
a man.</p>

<p>The sight recalled to his memory Thorek, the mammoth-man of
Ja-ru. These, indeed, must be mammoth-men; perhaps the country to
which he had wandered was Ja-ru. However, the fact that he had
been on friendly terms with Thorek induced no illusions as to the
reception he might expect from the savage tribesmen of his
erstwhile companion in slavery. Discretion counseled him to keep
out of sight; and so he moved cautiously down the hill toward a
clump of trees that grew beside the river, where, concealed from
their view, he could still watch the approach of the company.</p>

<p>As he reached the trees he saw the embers of a camp fire still
glowing; and his heart leaped in his bosom, for he knew that he
was now close on the trail of La-ja and her abductors. Which way
had they gone from here? They could not be far, for no matter how
much the timelessness of Pellucidar might deceive the mind of man
it could not befuddle the laws of combustion&mdash;fire would
consume wood as quickly and embers would remain hot as long here
as upon the outer crust and no longer.</p>

<p>He hastily examined the ground about the camp site. For the
moment the mammoth-men were forgotten in contemplation of the
nearness of La-ja and the surge of rage against Frug and Skruf,
now almost within reach of his vengeance. He loosened the gun in
its holster. He would give no quarter, but would shoot them down
as he would a couple of mad dogs; nor was there a question of
doubt as to the rightness of his contemplated act, so easily does
man slough the thin veneer of inhibitions with which civilization
conceals but does not eradicate primal instincts and
characteristics of mankind. There were no laws here for him other
than those he made himself.</p>

<p>His search revealed the footsteps of those he sought in the
soft earth at the river's edge. He recognized them all&mdash;the
imprints of the great, splay feet of the men, those of La-ja,
small and perfect. They led to the river and did not return. By
that he knew that they had crossed. He looked in that direction
and saw the mammoth-men steadily approaching. They were much
nearer now, the long, swinging strides of the mammoths covering
ground rapidly.</p>

<p>Trees and bushes grew upon the far bank of the river, grew in
isolated clumps as though planted by the hand of some master
landscape gardener. Between two such clusters of bushes he could
still see the mammoth-men, but he could see to no great distance
either to the right or left. He wished to cross the river in
pursuit of those he sought, but he did not wish to attract the
attention of the mammoth-men to him. Cautiously he moved down
stream until a clump of bushes on the opposite bank hid him from
the view of the approaching warriors; then, careless of the
possible presence of dangerous reptiles, he plunged into the
stream, which was neither wide nor swift. A few powerful strokes
carried him to the opposite bank, where he again sought the trail
of the trio. Nor did he have far to search, for he found it
almost immediately leading out toward the plain where the
mammoth-men rode.</p>

<p>To follow immediately would be to reveal his presence to the
approaching warriors, who could not fail to see him should he
expose himself now, as they were not over a quarter of a mile
away. They had changed their course slightly and were moving up
stream more nearly parallel, with the course of the river.
Presently they would pass him, and he would be free to continue
his search for La-ja. As he waited, he stood partially concealed
behind a bush, only a little of his face showing. Thus he watched
the mammoth-men. They were moving steadily upon their course,
like soldiers of any age upon the march, the monotony of which
lulls even exuberant spirits into quiescence. But suddenly there
was a change. A rider looking toward the river suddenly halted
his mount and shouted to his fellows, pointing back down stream
at something evidently some distance below the point where von
Horst was hiding. Simultaneously he started in the direction he
had pointed, urging his lumbering mount into a swifter gait; and
after him trooped the remainder of the company.</p>

<p>Savage, primitive to the degree was the sight of that war-like
company to von Horst&mdash;extinct men upon extinct mounts;
animated monuments of savage might. The European was thrilled;
and, too, his curiosity was aroused. What had the warrior seen?
What were they approaching or pursuing? Risking discovery, von
Horst, moved stealthily around the end of the bush that had
concealed him, until he could look down the valley in the
direction the mammoth-men were riding.</p>

<p>At first he saw nothing. A tiny hillock, scarcely more than a
mound, shut off his view. Assured that the attention of the
riders was riveted upon whatever quarry lay ahead of them and
that they would not notice him, von Horst crept forward to the
mound and up its side until he could see beyond its summit. What
he saw brought his heart into his mouth.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; CAPTURED</a></h2>

<p class="first">Von Horst sprang from his concealment and ran
out into the open; and as he did so he reached for his gun, but
his holster was empty. There was no time to go back and search
for the weapon. He recalled loosening it in its holster before he
plunged into the river, and now he assumed that it had fallen out
at that time. It was a tragic loss; but there was nothing that he
could do about it, and that which he saw before him tended to
crowd all other considerations into the background. Running
toward the river from out upon the plain and pursued now by the
mammoth-men were three figures which he instantly recognized as
La-ja and her abductors. The trees that dotted both sides of the
river grew closer together just ahead and formed a little forest
toward which the three were running. Skruf had seized La-ja by a
hand and was dragging her along, while Frug brought up the rear.
Although La-ja was running it was evident that she was attempting
to break loose from Skruf, and Frug was striking at her with a
heavy switch in an effort to goad her to greater speed. It seemed
certain that they would reach the forest ahead of the mammoth-men
if nothing delayed them, though by a small margin. Perhaps then
they might escape, yet La-ja was trying to delay them. Her only
reason, as far as von Horst could imagine, was that she would
prefer to be the captive of the mammoth-men than to remain a
prisoner of the Bastians.</p>

<p>Uppermost in von Horst's mind was the desire to reach the
great brute that was striking the girl. Never before in his life
had the instinct to kill an enemy so overwhelmingly mastered him.
He even forgot the menace of the advancing mammoth-men in the
heat of his hate and blood lust.</p>

<p>He came diagonally upon the three from the side and a little
to the rear, but so engrossed were they with one another and
their flight that they did not see him until he was almost upon
them and had shouted a curt command to Frug to stop striking the
girl. A new fear was added to the terror already reflected in
Skruf's eyes, a new hope leaped to La-ja's, a glad cry to her
lips as she voiced the one word, "Von!" What a wealth of relief
and hope were expressed in that single monosyllable! Surprise and
rage were in Frug's snarled recognition as he vouchsafed his
reply and registered his contempt for the man by striking again
at La-ja. And then, just at the edge of the wood, von Horst
leaped for him, leaped for his throat; and the two went down,
rolling on the flower starred turf in what each hoped was a duel
to the death.</p>

<p>Both men were powerful; but Frug outweighed his antagonist by
thirty pounds, an advantage that, however, was offset by von
Horst's agility and skill. All that was in the mind of either was
to kill the other&mdash;everything else was forgotten. Each
fought for a hold upon the other's throat, each struck terrific
blows at the other's face. The caveman grunted and cursed; von
Horst fought in silence. And thus the mammoth-men came upon them,
surrounding them. A dozen leaped from their huge mounts and fell
upon the two. These, too, were mighty men. They dragged the
combatants apart and made them prisoners.</p>

<p>It was then that von Horst had an opportunity to look around
for La-ja. She was nowhere in sight; neither was Skruf. The chief
of the mammoth-men was looking for them, too; and when he saw
that they were missing he sent a party of his men across the
river in search of them. The remainder mounted the mammoths after
having two of the great beasts swing von Horst and Frug to their
heads in front of their riders; then, without waiting for the
party that had gone in search of La-ja and Skruf, they set off
again in the direction they had been going at the time the
discovery of the three had interrupted their march.</p>

<p>The mammoth-men appeared very sure of themselves, so much so
that they did not even bind their prisoners' hands; which was the
equivalent of saying that escape was impossible; nor did von
Horst doubt but that such was the case. The leader and some of
the others questioned him. They asked him his name, from what
country he came, where he was going. They were gruff, unfriendly
men; and it was easy to see that they hated all strangers. So
accustomed was von Horst to this characteristic of Pellucidarians
that he made no effort to assure them that he was friendly,
reasoning, and rightly, that it would have been a waste of energy
and breath.</p>

<p>As they moved on up the river they presently discovered a huge
mammoth ahead of them. It was in the open, so that they could not
stalk it; but evidently they particularly wished it.</p>

<p>"It is he," said one. "I would know him as far as I could see
him."</p>

<p>"The trap did not get him," commented the leader. "He is too
wise to be fooled by traps."</p>

<p>"What good would he be if we did catch him?" demanded another.
"He is an ugly customer. Already he has killed ten men that we
know of who hunted him. He could never be trained now, he is too
old."</p>

<p>"Mamth wishes him," said the leader. "That is enough; Mamth is
chief. He will use him in the little canyon. He will give us
great sport."</p>

<p>The great beast had been moving off across the plain when they
first saw him; now he turned and faced them&mdash;a huge
creature, larger than any of those the mammoth-men rode.</p>

<p>"It's he all right," said the warrior, upon whose mount von
Horst rode; "it's <i>Ah Ara, Ma Rahna</i>."</p>

<p>It was then that von Horst first noticed the great patch of
white hair on the animal's left jowl. "<i>Ah Ara, Ma Rahna</i>;
Old White, The Killer," he mused. The killer! He realized now how
foolhardy he had been in approaching the beast at all. The fact
that he had not been killed suggested that the huge creature was
not only endowed with great intelligence but with a well
developed sense of gratitude. Only thus could he account for his
being still alive.</p>

<p>The leader of the band issued some instructions, and the party
spread out and started to circle Old White, which remained facing
them, making no effort to escape.</p>

<p>"Trog's going to try to drive him," remarked the warrior with
von Horst. "If he can bring in <i>Ah Ara</i> he will be a great
man."</p>

<p>"Can he?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>The warrior shrugged. "The sun-bleached bones of ten warriors
are a better answer than any living tongue can offer."</p>

<p>Slowly the warriors drew around behind <i>Ah Ara</i> in a half
circle; then they closed and moved forward. In the meantime the
quarry had turned again to face them. His little eyes gleamed,
his trunk weaved slowly to and fro as he rocked his head from
side to side. The warriors commenced to shout and wave their
spears. They came closer. It seemed incredible that the animal
did not turn and break for freedom; but it did not&mdash;<i>Ah
Ara</i> stood his ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly he raised his trunk and, with a loud scream, charged.
Straight for the center of the line he came&mdash;a solid line,
for the mammoths were touching side to side. He lowered his head;
and when he struck, two mammoths were knocked down. As he passed
over them he seized one of the riders and hurled him fifty feet;
then as he passed over him, he trampled him. After that he
appeared to pay no more attention to the party, but moved on
majestically in the direction he had been going before the
interruption. It seemed to von Horst that his whole manner
screamed contempt for the man-things that had dared to delay
him.</p>

<p>Trog shook his head ruefully and turned toward the river. The
two felled mammoths came to their feet&mdash;one of them was
riderless, but he followed on with the others. No one paid any
attention to the mangled warrior lying on the plain. Perhaps he
was dead, but he may not have been. It was evident to von Horst
that these men held human life lightly and that they were without
compassion. He wondered if Thorek would recall that he had
suggested that they be friends should they meet again, for it was
possible that he might meet him now that he was a prisoner of
Thorek's fellows. Prompted by this recollection of the man who
had escaped from the Bastians with him he turned toward the
warrior riding behind him.</p>

<p>"Do you know Thorek?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; what do you know of him?"</p>

<p>"We are friends."</p>

<p>The warrior laughed. "No stranger is friend to a mammoth-man,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Did Thorek return from Basti?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"No," and then suddenly, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Von. If Thorek were here he would tell you that we are
friends."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps Thorek was your friend; but no other mammoth-
man will be. Friendship for a stranger is weakness in a warrior.
Strangers are to be killed; that is why they are strangers. If
there were no strangers there would be no one to kill except one
another, and that would not be good for the tribe. We would soon
kill each other off. Men must fight and kill; it is the life
blood of warriors." Presently they came to the river and crossed
it, keeping slightly above the regular ford; then Trog and some
of the others dismounted and examined the ground in the trail
leading in to the river. Von Horst watched them with amusement,
for he recognized the spot well. He saw that the men were
surprised and angry at what they discovered.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah Ara</i> has been down here," exclaimed Trog. "There is
blood here; but where are the stakes? They have all been
removed."</p>

<p>"I saw mud and blood on the right side of <i>Ah Ara</i> as he
passed close to me when he charged through our line," volunteered
a warrior.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was down here," growled Trog. "We had him, but how
could he have escaped?"</p>

<p>"He is very old and very wise," said one.</p>

<p>"He could never be old enough or wise enough to pick the
splinters from his pads and his side, to pick them all out of the
ground," remonstrated Trog. "That could only be done by a
man."</p>

<p>"Here are the foot-prints of a man," exclaimed a warrior.</p>

<p>"But who would dare approach <i>Ah Ara</i> and take the
splinters from him? Had a man done that we should find his body
close by." Trog shook his head. "I do not understand."</p>

<p>They found the splinters where von Horst had tossed them
aside, and they set them out again with great care and well
concealed upon the opposite side of the river; then they mounted
and rode back toward the hills from which they had been coming
when von Horst first sighted them.</p>

<p>"We'll get him yet," remarked von Horst's warrior.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the European.</p>

<p>"When he gets splinters in his feet the pain is so great that
he cannot stand; the pads of a tandor are thick, but they are
very sensitive. When we come back and find him down we put heavy
thongs of mammoth hide about his neck. These are fastened to
three mammoths on each side of him, mammoths trained for this
work; then we take the splinters from the ground around him and
from his pads and let him get up. After that it is easy. The six
mammoths drag him until he tires of being choked. After that he
will follow quietly."</p>

<p>"Will you ever be able to train <i>Ah Ara</i>, provided you
get him?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>The warrior shook his head. "He would never be safe. Mamth
will put him in the little canyon, and he will afford us much
amusement."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>The warrior looked at von Horst and grinned. "I think you will
find out soon enough," he said.</p>

<p>After the party reached the foothills it followed a well worn
trail that led up to a wide plateau upon which several mighty
canyons debouched from the mountains beyond. The plateau was
covered with lush grasses and was crossed by several streams that
issued from the mouths of the canyons, into one of which Trog led
his savage troop. The grandeur of the scenery within the canyon
was impressive, and to such an extent that for the moment von
Horst almost forgot the hopelessness of his situation. Within its
narrow mouth the canyon widened into a lovely valley walled by
precipitous cliffs that were broken occasionally by the narrow
mouths of smaller canyons. A stream flowed through the bed of the
canyon, trees and flowering shrubs grew in profusion, fish leaped
in the river, and birds of weird, prehistoric shapes and
coloration flew from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Von Horst sighed. "What a lovely place," he thought, "if only
La-ja and I were here alone."</p>

<p>La-ja! What had become of her? Had she escaped from Skruf, or
was she still his captive? She would have been better off here
among the mammoth-men, or at least no worse off; for no one could
have been more repugnant to her than Skruf. At least, were she
here, she would have had one friend whom she might trust even
though he were unable to do anything for her.</p>

<p>Von Horst sighed. He had a premonition that he would never
again see La-ja, and it suddenly occurred to him that this
strange world was going to be a very much more terrible place to
live in because of that. He realized that something had gone out
of his life that nothing could replace. Perhaps it hurt his pride
to admit it even to himself, for the girl had certainly given him
sufficient proof on numerous occasions that he meant nothing
whatever to her; yet he could not forget the pathetic longing
note in her voice when she had recognized him and called to him
just before the mammoth-men had separated them forever.</p>

<p>Depressed by this sad reverie, his future fate seemed to mean
nothing to him. He did not care what the mammoth-men did to him.
The sooner it was over, the better. Without a single companion
for whom he cared, he might as well be dead as alive; for there
was no chance that he might ever return to the outer world, nor
little more that he would find Sari should he escape from his
present predicament.</p>

<p>While he was occupied by these unhappy thoughts the troop
turned into one of the smaller canyons, and shortly thereafter he
saw the caves of the mammoth-men pitting the lace of the lofty
cliff ahead. A considerable number of men, women, and children,
were on the ground at the foot of the cliff where a grove of
trees offered shelter from the noonday sun. Some of the women
busied themselves around cooking fires; others were fashioning
sandals or loin cloths. Men chipped laboriously at stone weapons
in the making, scraped spear shafts into shape, or merely loafed
at ease. At sight of the returning troop, they quit whatever had
been occupying them and clustered about to inspect the prisoners
and exchange gossip with the arriving warriors.</p>

<p>Trog looked very important. "Where is Mamth?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He is in his cave, sleeping," said a woman.</p>

<p>"Go and awaken him," commanded Trog.</p>

<p>"Go yourself," replied the woman; "I do not wish to be
killed."</p>

<p>Trog, who, with the other warriors of his party, had,
dismounted, was standing near the woman; and at her refusal he
swung his spear quickly and felled her with the haft, knocking
her unconscious; then he turned to another woman. "Go and awaken
Mamth," he said.</p>

<p>The woman laughed in his face. "Guva has no man," she said,
"but I have. You will not knock me down with your spear. You
would not have knocked Guva down if she had had one. Go and
awaken Mamth yourself."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of your man," blustered Trog.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you knock me down," taunted the woman, "for I
am not going to awaken Mamth."</p>

<p>The crowd gathered about commenced to laugh at Trog, adding to
his discomfiture and his rage. He stood there, red in the face,
swinging his spear to and fro and looking from one to another of
them.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" demanded the woman, "&mdash;widows
and orphans?"</p>

<p>"You will pay for this," growled Trog; then his eyes alighted
on von Horst. "Go and awaken Mamth." he commanded.</p>

<p>The European grinned. "Where is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>Trog pointed to a cave entrance part way up the cliff. "He is
in there," he growled. "Get along with you!" He swung his spear,
striking at von Horst. The prisoner dodged, and seizing the
weapon wrenched it from Trog's grasp; then he broke it across his
knee and flung it on the ground at the mammoth-man's feet.</p>

<p>"I am neither a woman nor a child," he said; and, turning,
started toward the cliff and Mamth's cave, in his ears the shouts
and laughter of the tribesmen.</p>

<p>"I kill!" shouted Trog, and started after him, drawing his
stone knife.</p>

<p>Von Horst wheeled and waited the mad charge of the mammoth-
man. Trog approached him at a run, brandishing his knife above
his shoulder. When he struck, von Horst seized his wrist, turned
quickly, stooped low and, drawing the man's arm across his
shoulder, hurled him over his head and heavily to the ground;
then he continued on his way to the foot of the cliff and up the
rude ladders that led to Mamth's cave. Glancing back over his
shoulder he saw Trog still lying where he had fallen, apparently
insensible, while the crowd laughed uproariously, evidencing to
von Horst that his act had not prejudiced them against him and,
also, that Trog did not appear to be overly popular.</p>

<p>He wondered just how popular he himself would be with Mamth
when he awakened him, for he had gathered from what he had just
heard that Mamth did not relish being awakened from his sleep;
and he had seen just how primitive these people were and how
little control they had of their tempers&mdash;like primitive
people everywhere, even those who were supposed to be civilized
and yet had primitive minds. When at last he came to the mouth of
the cave he looked in, but he could see nothing, because of the
darkness of the interior. He shouted Mamth's name in a loud voice
and waited. There was no response. The laughter below had ceased.
The watchers were waiting in tense expectancy the result of his
temerity.</p>

<p>Von Horst shouted again, this time more loudly; and this time
there was a response&mdash;a bull-like bellow and the sound of
movement within. Then a perfect mountain of a man emerged from
the cave, his hair disheveled, his beard awry, his eyes sleep
bleared and bloodshot. When he saw von Horst he stopped in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded. "Why did you awaken Mamth? Do you
wish to be killed?"</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," replied von Horst. "Trog sent me to awaken
you because he was afraid to do it himself; and as for being
killed, that is probably what I was taken prisoner for."</p>

<p>"Trog sent you, did he?" demanded Mamth. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>Von Horst pointed toward the foot of the cliff where Trog
still lay. Mamth looked down.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"He tried to kill me with a dagger," explained the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"And you killed him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He is probably merely stunned."</p>

<p>"What did he wish of me?"</p>

<p>"He wished to show you the two prisoners he brought in. I am
one of them."</p>

<p>"He disturbed my sleep for that!" grumbled Mamth. "Now I
cannot get to sleep again." He pointed, to the ladder. "Go down."
Von Horst did as he was bid, and Mamth followed him. When they
reached the ground Trog was regaining consciousness. Mamth went
and stood over him.</p>

<p>"So-ho!" he exclaimed. "So you were afraid to come and awaken
Mamth, but you sent a prisoner who might have sneaked into the
cave and killed Mamth in his sleep. You are a fool. And you let
the prisoner knock the wits from your head. You are a fine one to
be sub-chief. What happened?"</p>

<p>"He must have hit me over the head with a big rock when I
wasn't looking," said Trog.</p>

<p>"He did not," cried a woman. "Trog was going to hit the
prisoner with his spear. The prisoner took Trog's spear from him
and broke it in two. There it lies. Then Trog tried to kill the
prisoner with his knife. The prisoner picked Trog up and threw
him over his head."</p>

<p>A number of them commenced to laugh as the woman recalled the
events, but they did not laugh so loudly in the presence of
Mamth.</p>

<p>The chief looked searchingly at von Horst. "So you broke
Trog's spear and then threw him over your head!" he exclaimed.
"Where is the other prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Here," said one of the warriors guarding Frug.</p>

<p>Mamth looked at the Bastian. "He is even bigger than the
other," he said. "They should furnish us good sport in the little
canyon. Take them away. Gorph, take this one to your cave and see
that he does not escape." He jerked a thumb toward von Horst.
"Truth, you take charge of the other. Have them ready when Mamth
wishes them. Trog, you are no longer a sub-chief. Mamth will
appoint a better man."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; "HE DIES!"</a></h2>

<p class="first">Gorph was a short, stocky, middle-aged man with
a wealth of whiskers and small, close-set eyes. Von Horst judged
him a mean customer even before the fellow gave any indication of
his true nature, which he was not long in doing; for as soon as
Mamth indicated that he was to take over the prisoner he stepped
up to von Horst, seized him roughly by the shoulder and gave him
a push toward the foot of the cliff and the nearest ladder. "Get
along!" he growled, "and be quick about it." Then, without other
reason than pure brutality, he prodded his prisoner in the back
with the point of his spear&mdash;a vicious jab that brought
blood. Resentment and rage flared in the breast of the man from
the outer crust, the sudden pain goading him to instant action.
He wheeled and crouched. Gorph, sensing attack, jabbed at him
again with his spear; but von Horst pushed the weapon aside and
leaped close, pinioning the mammoth-man's head beneath his right
arm; then he commenced to spin, faster and faster. Gorph's feet
left the ground, his body whirled, almost horizontal, in a
flattening circle; von Horst released his hold and sent the
fellow spinning to the ground.</p>

<p>Mamth broke into a loud guffaw, which was echoed by the other
spectators. Gorph staggered dizzily to his feet; but before he
was fully erect von Horst clamped the same hold upon him, and
once again whirled and threw him. When Gorph arose this time,
dizzy and befuddled, the other was standing over him. His fists
were clenched, an arm was back ready to deliver a blow to the
bewhiskered chin that would have put the mammoth-man out for
good; but then his rage left him as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>"The next time you try anything like that on me, Gorph, I'll
kill you," he said. "Pick up your spear and go along. I'll
follow."</p>

<p>He had given no thought as to what the reaction of the other
mammoth-men might be to his attack upon one of their fellows; nor
had he cared; but their laughter assured him that they had
enjoyed the discomfiture of Gorph, as they would probably enjoy
the discomfiture of any creature. Gorph stood for a moment,
hesitant. He heard the laughter and the taunts of his fellows. He
was trembling with rage; but he looked at the man who had bested
him, standing there waiting to best him again; and his courage
proved unequal to his anger.</p>

<p>He stepped over to retrieve his spear, and as he passed von
Horst he spoke in a low tone of voice. "I'll kill you yet," he
said.</p>

<p>The European shrugged and followed him. Gorph walked to a
ladder and started to ascend. "See that nothing happens to him,
Gorph," shouted Mamth. "He'll be a good one for the little
canyon."</p>

<p>"You see," remarked von Horst, "that between Mamth and me
it'll be best for your health that you treat me well."</p>

<p>Gorph mumbled in his beard as he climbed to the third tier of
caves, von Horst following him upward. Here the mammoth-man
followed the wide ledge to the right and stopped before a large
entrance in which squatted three women. One was middle-aged, the
other two much younger. Of these, she who appeared to be the
elder was short and squat like Gorph, an unprepossessing girl
with a sinister countenance. Their only clothing was scanty loin-
cloths.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" demanded the woman.</p>

<p>"Another mouth to feed," grumbled Gorph; "one of the prisoners
that Trog brought in. We keep him and guard him, but if he falls
off the cliff it will not be my fault."</p>

<p>The elder of the two girls grinned. "He might," she said.</p>

<p>The man walked to the younger girl and kicked her. "Get me
food," he growled, "and be quick about it."</p>

<p>The girl winced and scurried into the cave. Gorph squatted
beside the other two women. The elder was fashioning a pair of
sandals with soles of mammoth-hide; the other just sat staring
vacantly at nothing.</p>

<p>Gorph eyed her, scowling. "How much longer shall I have to
hunt for you, Grum?" demanded Gorph. "Why don't you get a man?
Won't any of them have you?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," growled Grum. "If they won't have me it's because I
look like you&mdash;because I am like you. If you'd been a woman
you'd never have had a mate. I hate you."</p>

<p>Gorph leaned over and struck her in the face. "Get out of
here!" he cried; "go get yourself a man."</p>

<p>"Leave her alone," said the older woman wearily.</p>

<p>"Keep out of this," warned Gorph, "or I'll kick your ribs
in."</p>

<p>The woman sighed.</p>

<p>"That is all that Mumal does," sneered Grum. "She just sits
and sighs&mdash;she and that monkey-faced Lotai. Sometimes I
could kill them both."</p>

<p>"You are a bad daughter," said Mumal. "The time that I bore
you was a bad time indeed."</p>

<p>"Get out!" growled Gorph. "I told you to get out." He pointed
a stubby finger at Grum.</p>

<p>"Try to put me out," snapped the girl. "I'd scratch out your
eyes. Get me a man. If you were any good you'd get men for both
your daughters. You're a coward. You're afraid to fight men for
us."</p>

<p>"If I ever made a man marry you he'd sneak up behind me in the
woods the first chance he got and kill me."</p>

<p>"I'd help him," said Grum.</p>

<p>"Lotai!" bellowed Gorph. "Where is the food?"</p>

<p>"Coming!" called the girl from the interior of the cave, and a
moment later she came with a handful of dried meat. She tossed it
on the ground in front of Gorph and backed away to the far corner
of the entrance, where she sat in huddled misery.</p>

<p>Gorph attacked the meat like a ravenous wolf, breaking off
great hunks between his powerful teeth and swallowing them
whole.</p>

<p>"Water!" he snapped, when he had finished.</p>

<p>The girl called Lotai arose and hurried back into the cave. A
moment later she returned with a gourd which she handed to
Gorph.</p>

<p>"That is all," she said; "there is no more water." Gorph
gulped it down and arose. "I am going to sleep now," he said.
"I'll kill anyone who awakens me. Mumal, you and Grum go for
water. Lotai, watch the prisoner. If he tries to escape, scream;
and I'll come out and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what?" inquired von Horst.</p>

<p>"Do as I told you," said Gorph to the women, ignoring von
Horst's query; then he lumbered into the cave.</p>

<p>The two older women followed him, returning shortly each with
a large gourd; then they descended the ladders on their way for
water. Von Horst looked at the young girl who had been left to
guard him. Now that the others had gone the strained expression
that had clouded her face had disappeared, and she was more
beautiful than before.</p>

<p>"Happy family," he remarked.</p>

<p>She looked at him questioningly. "Do you think so?" she asked.
"Perhaps the others are happy, though they do not seem so. I know
that I am not."</p>

<p>Once again von Horst was faced with the literal-mindedness of
the stone age. He was reminded of La-ja.</p>

<p>"I was only laughing with words," he explained.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I see. You do not really think that we are
happy?"</p>

<p>"Is it always like this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Sometimes it is worse; but when Mumal and I are alone, we are
happy. Grum hates me because I am pretty and she is not; Gorph
hates everyone. I think he even hates himself."</p>

<p>"It is strange that you have no mate," said von Horst; "you
are very good looking."</p>

<p>"No man will take me because he would have to take Grum, too,
if Gorph insisted&mdash;that is a law of the mammoth-men. You
see, she is older than I; and should have a man first."</p>

<p>"What did Grum mean when she said that Gorph was afraid to
fight men for you?"</p>

<p>"If we picked out men that we wanted they would have to take
us if Gorph fought them and won; but I would not wish a man that
way. I would wish my man to want me so much that he would fight
to get me."</p>

<p>"And that is the only way that Grum could get a mate?" asked
von Horst.</p>

<p>"Yes, because she has no brother to fight for her, nor any
friend to do it for her."</p>

<p>"You mean that any man who would fight for her could get her a
mate?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; but who would do it?"</p>

<p>"A friend might," he said; "or any man who wanted you badly
enough."She shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is not so easy as that. If a man who was not her father or
brother fought for her and lost, he would have to take her. And
Grum has made it even worse by choosing Horg as the man she
wishes to mate with. No one could defeat Horg. He is the biggest
and strongest man in the tribe."</p>

<p>"Rather a precarious method of getting a mate," mused von
Horst. "If your man is vanquished, you get him; but you may get a
corpse."</p>

<p>"No," she explained. "They fight with bare hands until one of
them gives up. Sometimes they are badly hurt, but seldom is
anyone killed."</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a while, the girl watching the man
intently. Von Horst was thinking of La-ja and wondering what fate
had befallen her. He was sad in the knowledge that she had passed
out of his life forever&mdash;the haughty, imperious little slave
girl who hated him. He wondered if she really did hate him. There
were times when he doubted that she did. He shook his head. Who
could ever understand a woman?</p>

<p>Lotai stirred.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Von," he replied.</p>

<p>"I think you are a very nice man," she said.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I think you are a very nice girl."</p>

<p>"You are not like any man I have ever seen before. I think you
are a man that I would trust. You would never beat me. You would
always be kind, and you would talk to me as men talk to men. That
is something our men never do. At first, maybe, they are nice;
but soon they only speak to give orders or to scold.</p>

<p>"Oh, some of them are not so bad as others," she added. "I
think that Gorph, my father, is the worst. He is very bad. He
never says a pleasant word to any of us, and he is worse with me
than with the others. He beats me and kicks me. I think that he
hates me. But that is all right, because I hate him.</p>

<p>"There was one very nice man. I liked him, but he went away
and never came back. He must be dead. He was a big man and a
great warrior; but he was kind to women and children, and he
laughed and was pleasant. The women would all have liked him for
a mate, but he never would take a mate to live always in his
cave. Thorek was different that way."</p>

<p>"Thorek?" exclaimed von Horst. "He did not come back to Ja-
ru?"</p>

<p>"You know him?" asked Lotai.</p>

<p>"We were prisoners of the Bastians, and we escaped together.
We were friends. He should have been here before this. Since we
parted I have traveled far and slept many times. Something must
have happened to him."</p>

<p>The girl sighed. "He was such a nice man; but then, what
difference does it make? He was not for me. I will get a mate
like Gorph and be kicked and beaten the rest of my life."</p>

<p>"The women of Ja-ru have a hard time of it, I should say,"
remarked von Horst.</p>

<p>"Not all of them. Only those like Mumal and myself. Some of
them are big and strong and like to fight. If they are kicked,
they kick back. These have a happy time. Mumal and I are
different. She is not of Ja-ru. Gorph stole her from another
tribe. I am like her, and Grum is like Gorph. We would run away
and go back to my mother's country; but it is very far, and the
dangers are great. We would be killed long before we got to
Sari."</p>

<p>"Sari," mused von Horst. "That is the country that Dangar came
from. That is where I should like to go when I escape from
here."</p>

<p>"You will never escape," said Lotai. "You will go into the
little canyon, and you will never come out."</p>

<p>"What is this little canyon I have heard so much about?"
demanded the man.</p>

<p>"You will find out soon enough. Here come Mumal and Grum with
the water. We must not talk together too much in front of Grum
and Gorph. If they thought that I was friendly with a prisoner
they would kick me and beat me all the more."</p>

<p>The two women came into view up the ladder from below, each
balancing a heavy gourd of water on her head. Mumal looked tired
and dejected. Grum was hot and irritable, her evil face twisted
in a black frown. She paused in the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>"I am going to sleep," she said. "See that you don't make any
noise;" then she entered the cave.</p>

<p>Mumal stooped and stroked Lotai's hair as she passed. "I too
am going to sleep, little one," she said.</p>

<p>"I should like to sleep myself," remarked Lotai after the
others had entered the cave.</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"I have to watch you."</p>

<p>"I'll promise not to go away while you are guarding me," he
assured her. "Go in and sleep. I'd like to myself."</p>

<p>She looked at him intently for a long time before she spoke.
"I believe that you would not try to escape if you told me you
would not," she said, "but if Gorph found you out here while I
was asleep in the cave it would be just as bad for me as though
you had escaped. If you will go in though and not come out while
I am sleeping it will be safe. We can go into a far corner of the
cave and sleep, and then they won't bother us."</p>

<p>Von Horst was very tired, and he must have slept a long time.
When he awoke, Lotai was not there. He found her with the others
on the ledge before the cave. They were eating jerked venison,
washing it down with great draughts of water. Gorph and Grum ate
noisily, like beasts.</p>

<p>No one offered von Horst food. It lay in a little pile on a
piece of skin in which it had been wrapped, filthy looking and
malodorous; but it was food, and von Horst was famished. He
walked over to it where it lay close to Gorph, and stooped to
take some. As he did so Gorph struck his hand away.</p>

<p>"This fine food is not for slaves," he growled. "Go to the
back of the cave and get the scraps and the bones that are
there."</p>

<p>From the vile odor that he had noticed in the cave, von Horst
could surmise the nature of the food that was intended for him,
food that only actual starvation could drive him to eat. He knew
that his future life with these people, however short or however
long it might be, would depend largely upon the attitude that he
took at this time. He reached again for the food; and again Gorph
struck at his hand, but this time von Horst seized the fellow's
wrist, jerked him to his feet, and struck him a heavy blow on the
jaw. Gorph dropped in his tracks. Von Horst gathered up a handful
of the venison, picked up a gourd of water and crossed to the
opposite side of the entrance where Mumal and Lotai sat wide eyed
and trembling. There he sat down and commenced to eat.</p>

<p>Grum had not spoken, and now she sat with her eyes upon von
Horst; but what was passing in the dark convolutions of that
savage brain none might guess. Was she filled with rage that a
stranger had struck down her father? Was she selfishly resentful
that he had taken food? Or was she secretly admiring his courage,
strength, and skill?</p>

<p>Presently consciousness returned to Gorph. He opened his eyes
and raised himself on one elbow. He looked puzzled and was
evidently trying to gather the threads of what had transpired. He
stared at von Horst and the venison he was eating. Presently be
rubbed his jaw, feeling of it gingerly as though to discover if
it were broken; then he fell to eating. During all that had
transpired no one had spoken; but von Horst was
satisfied&mdash;he knew that he would not again be denied food
and needed no verbal assurance of the fact.</p>

<p>The endless Pellucidarian day dragged on. Von Horst ate and
slept. Gorph hunted, sometimes returning with the carcass of a
kill or cuts from those he had hunted with companions, sometimes
empty handed. Von Horst saw parties of mammoth-men come and go on
their huge mounts. He talked with Lotai and with Mumal.
Occasionally Grum joined in the conversations, but more often she
sat in silence staring at von Horst.</p>

<p>The man wondered what his fate was to be and when he would
know. The timelessness of Pellucidar offered no standard for the
measurement of duration. It was this fact, he judged, that made
the Pellucidarians seem so often to be dilatory. "Immediately"
here might encompass the passage of an hour or a day of the outer
crust's solar time or, conceivably, a much longer period. Perhaps
Mamth thought that he was handling the fate of the two prisoners
with dispatch, but to von Horst it seemed an eternity. He had
never seen Frug since they had been separated at the foot of the
cliff, and if he never saw him again it would be far too
soon.</p>

<p>On one occasion von Horst was sitting on the ledge before the
entrance to the cave thinking of La-ja, as he often did, and
wondering if she still lived. He was alone, for Gorph was
hunting, Mumal and Lotai had gone up the canyon for a potato-like
tuber; and Grum was asleep in the cave. He was enjoying the
solitude, free from the scolding and cruelty of the family when
either Grum or Gorph were present. He was day-dreaming, recalling
pleasant memories, conjuring the faces and figures of friends of
by-gone days&mdash;friends that he would never see again; but the
thought did not make him particularly sad. It was good to recall
the happier events of the past. His reveries were interrupted by
the shuffling of sandaled feet within the cave. Grum was awake.
Presently she came out on the ledge. She stood looking at him
intently for a moment.</p>

<p>"You would make me a good mate," she said. "I want you."</p>

<p>Von Horst laughed.</p>

<p>"What makes you think I would make a good mate?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I saw the way you handled Gorph," she replied. "I was told
what you did to Trog. I want you for my mate."</p>

<p>"But I am a stranger and a prisoner. I think I've heard one of
you say that your women couldn't mate with the men of other
tribes."</p>

<p>"I will see Mamth about that. Perhaps he would consent. You
would make a good warrior for Mamth."</p>

<p>Von Horst stretched comfortably and grinned. He felt quite
safe. "Mamth would never give his consent," he said.</p>

<p>"Then we will run away," announced Grum. "I am tired of living
here; I hate them all."</p>

<p>"You've got it all figured out, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I have. It is all settled," replied Grum.</p>

<p>"But suppose I don't want you for a mate?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It will be better than death," she reminded him. "If you stay
here you will go to your death in the little canyon."</p>

<p>"We could not escape. If escape had been possible, I would
have been gone long since. I have constantly watched for my
chance."</p>

<p>"We can escape," said Grum. "I know a way that you do not know
of."</p>

<p>"How about Horg?" he asked. "I thought you wanted Horg."</p>

<p>"I do, but I can't get him."</p>

<p>"If I helped you to get Horg, would you help me to escape?" he
asked, as an idea suddenly developed in his mind.</p>

<p>"How could you get Horg for me?"</p>

<p>"I have an idea that I could. If we could go to Mamth
together, and you asked him to let me be your mate, he would
refuse; then I could explain the plan I have that would get Horg
for you. I think he would like it."</p>

<p>"Will you do it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Will you help me escape?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she promised.</p>

<p>As they talked, von Horst saw a party of mammoth-men returning
to the village on their huge mounts. They came with shouts and
laughter, like conquering warriors; and there was one among them
riding double behind another warrior, who was surrounded by a
great crowd of jabbering, gesticulating natives as soon as he
dismounted. The man from the outer crust watched them with but
little interest and only casual curiosity. He could not know the
cause of their exultation.</p>

<p>Shortly after the return of the warriors, von Horst noticed
considerable activity in the grove at the foot of the cliff.
Cooking fires were being built on the ground, which was unusual,
as most of the cooking was done by individual families on the
ledges before their caves.</p>

<p>"There is going to be a <i>karoo</i>," said Grum. "We shall
all go down and have much to eat and drink."</p>

<p>"What is a <i>karoo</i>?" he asked. It was a word he had not
heard before.</p>

<p>Grum explained that it was a feast and celebration in honor of
some noteworthy event, in which all of the members of the tribe
joined. She did not know the reason for this <i>karoo</i>, but
judged that it was to celebrate something important that the
returning party had accomplished.</p>

<p>"We can't go down until Gorph returns or Mamth sends for us,"
she said, "because my orders are to remain here and watch you;
but when Gorph comes he will take you down, as otherwise one of
us would have to remain here with you and miss the celebration.
You are a nuisance. I wish you were dead."</p>

<p>"Then you wouldn't get Horg," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"I won't get him anyway. There is nothing that you can do to
get him for me. I'll have to take you instead, but you're not the
man that Horg is. Wait until you see him. Compared with you he is
as the <i>tandor</i> is to the <i>thag</i>; and, besides, he has
a mighty beard. His face is not as yours, smooth like a woman's.
Always you are scraping off your beard with the strange, shiny
knife that you carry."</p>

<p>Presently Lotai and Mumal returned to the cave, to be followed
shortly by Gorph. The man carried the carcass of an antelope he
had killed; the women, a supply of tubers; and after they had
deposited these things in the cave Gorph ordered them all to
descend to the ground. Here there was a considerable gathering,
several hundred men, women, and children, comprising von Horst
concluded, the entire membership of the tribe. There, was much
talking and laughing&mdash;a holiday spirit seemed to possess the
gathering, making a strange contrast to their usual demeanor. The
strange warrior was still surrounded by such a large crowd that
von Horst did not catch a glimpse of him at first. Little
attention was paid to the prisoners as Frug squatted
disconsolately with his back to the bole of a tree, while von
Horst stood watching with interest the largest concourse of
really primitive people that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Presently Mamth discovered him. "Come here!" he shouted; then
he turned to the warrior who seemed the center of attraction.
"Here's a prisoner such as no man ever saw before. Take a look at
him. He has a face as smooth as a woman's and yellow hair. He
tossed Trog and Gorph around as though they were babies. Come
here you!" he again commanded von Horst.</p>

<p>As the prisoner approached, the warrior pushed his way through
the crowd to see him; and a moment later they stood face to
face.</p>

<p>"Thorek!" exclaimed von Horst.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" roared the mammoth-man. "It is Von or I'm a
<i>jalok</i>. So this is the man who tossed Trog and Gorph
around? I am not surprised. I can toss either of them, and he
tossed me."</p>

<p>"You know him?" demanded Mamth.</p>

<p>"Know him? We are friends. Together we escaped from Basti,
taking the slaves with us."</p>

<p>"Friends!" exclaimed Mamth. "He is a stranger. Mammoth-men do
not make friends of strangers."</p>

<p>"I did, and he made a good friend," retorted Thorek. "Because
of that he should have the friendship of all mammoth-men. He is a
great warrior, and should be allowed to live with us and take a
mate from among our women; or he should be permitted to go his
way unmolested."</p>

<p>The heavy visage of Mamth was furrowed by a black scowl. "No!"
he shouted. "He is a stranger and an enemy, and he dies as should
all the enemies of the mammoth-men. Mamth has been saving him for
the little canyon. When Mamth is ready, he goes there. Mamth has
spoken."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE
BRIDEGROOM</a></h2>

<p class="first">The sentence of death had been pronounced; but
von Horst was not shocked, because he was not surprised. He had
known all along that death in some form would end his captivity
if he did not escape. When it would come, in this timeless world,
could not be even a matter of conjecture. Thorek was angry; but
he could do nothing to save his friend, because Mamth was chief
and his word law. He sulked and grumbled beneath his breath, but
when the feast started he fell to with the rest and soon
apparently forgot his grievance in enjoyment of food and drink.
Von Horst and Frug were permitted to join in the celebration; and
after a taste of the brew that was being served, von Horst
concluded that it would not require much of it to cause a man to
forget more than a grievance. It was fermented by the
women&mdash;a mixture of wild maize, several herbs, and
honey&mdash;and while far from unpalatable it had the kick of an
army mule. One taste sufficed for von Horst. Both men and women
partook of it freely with varying results. Some became more
loquacious and hilarious, others morose and quarrelsome; so that
there was usually a fight progressing in some part of the grove.
There were some who did not drink at all, and von Horst noticed
that Lotai and Mumal were among these. Grum, on the contrary, was
evidently a two-fisted drinker; and while she carried it well, it
accentuated her distinctive characteristics, so that she became
more bellicose, domineering, and assertive. Von Horst watched her
not without some amusement, as she approached an enormous man and
threw her arms about his neck, revealing a characteristic that it
had taken several potent droughts to coax to the surface. Grum
evidencing affection bordered upon the ludicrous. Evidently the
large man felt the same way about it, for he roughly disengaged
her arms from about his neck and gave her a violent push that
sent her sprawling on the ground. She was up in an instant, a
veritable fury, her face distorted with rage. Von Horst thought
that she was going to attack the ungallant one, but instead she
barged down on Mamth.</p>

<p>"I want a mate," she screamed. "I want Horg." Mamth turned
toward the big man. "What does Horg say?" he demanded.</p>

<p>So that was Horg. Von Horst appraised the fellow and was glad
that he had not elected to fight him for the sake of the
delectable Grum. The man was a giant. He must have weighed close
to three hundred pounds, and he bulged with muscles.</p>

<p>Horg guffawed loudly. "Take that she-<i>tarag</i> as a mate!"
he bellowed. "I'd as soon take a Mahar."</p>

<p>"You heard him," said Mamth. "Go back to the <i>karoo</i> and
leave the man alone. He is not for you."</p>

<p>"He is for me," screamed Grum. "I have a warrior who will
fight Horg for me."</p>

<p>Every eye sought Gorph, and a great laugh followed. "Come on,
Gorph," a warrior shouted; "show us how you will best Horg, but
don't kill him."</p>

<p>Horg laughed uproariously. "Come on, Gorph," he cried. "If you
beat me I'll take Grum off your hands, and I don't blame you for
wanting to be rid of her."</p>

<p>"She's drunk too much <i>tumal</i>," growled Gorph. "I never
promised to fight Horg for her. Horg is my friend; I do not wish
to harm him."</p>

<p>This elicited another roar of laughter, and Horg thought that
it was so funny that he rolled on the ground bellowing his
amusement. Grum said nothing. She just watched Horg and Gorph in
silence for a moment; then she turned to Mamth.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that Gorph was going to fight Horg for me. Gorph
is a coward. He would fight nothing if he could get out of it. I
have a <i>man</i> who will fight Horg&mdash;and do it now."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" demanded Mamth.</p>

<p>Von Horst experienced a distinct sinking feeling around the
pit of his stomach. He knew what was coming. Grum pointed a
stubby, grimy finger at him. "There he is," she cried in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>"He's not a mammoth-man," objected Mamth. "How can he fight
for you?"</p>

<p>"Because no one else will," admitted Grum.</p>

<p>Mamth shook his head, but he did not have time to voice a
definite refusal before Horg spoke up.</p>

<p>"Let him fight me," he said. "This is a <i>karoo</i>, and we
should have some amusement."</p>

<p>"You will promise not to kill him?" demanded Mamth. "I am
saving him for the little canyon."</p>

<p>"I will not kill him," promised Horg.</p>

<p>Von Horst approached the two. "And when I have beaten you," he
demanded, "you will make Grum your mate?"</p>

<p>"That is the way of the mammoth-men," said Mamth. "He will
have to take her, but you will not beat him."</p>

<p>"Beat me!" bellowed Horg. "Let me get hold of him."</p>

<p>"How do we fight?" asked von Horst. "Are there any rules?"</p>

<p>"You fight as the beasts fight," explained Mamth. "You may use
no weapon, no stone nor stick. You fight until one of you is
unable to fight any longer or gives up."</p>

<p>"I am ready," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Horg?" demanded Mamth.</p>

<p>Horg laughed nonchalantly and contemptuously. "I am ready," he
said.</p>

<p>"Then fight!" commanded Mamth.</p>

<p>The spectators formed a circle about the combatants as the two
approached one another. Horg was in fine spirits. The
<i>tumal</i> he had drunk accounted partially for that, and
certainty of an easy victory took care of the rest. He cracked
jokes with his friends at the expense of both von Horst and Grum.
They were rather broad jokes and not at all of the parlor
variety, but every one enjoyed them immensely&mdash;that is,
everyone but Grum. She was furious.</p>

<p>"Wait until I get you," she screamed. "You'll wish you'd never
been born."</p>

<p>Von Horst grinned as he featured the life that was in store
for Horg should the mammoth-man lose. Death would be sweeter.</p>

<p>Suddenly Horg made a rush at von Horst, the brawny arms, the
ham-like hands endeavoring to close upon him; but von Horst
stooped and dodged beneath them; then he wheeled and struck Horg
on the jaw&mdash;a blow that staggered him. Before the mammoth-
man could recover, he was struck again; and again his head
rocked. Now he was furious. He cracked no more jokes. He bellowed
like an angry elephant and charged again. Again von Horst dodged
him, and the great hulk went lumbering on a dozen paces before it
could stop.</p>

<p>When Horg turned he saw von Horst charging him. This was what
he wished. Now he could get hold of the fellow, and once he got
hold of him he could crush him, break his bones if he wished
unless he gave up.</p>

<p>He stood waiting, his feet spread far apart, his arms open.
Von Horst ran swiftly straight toward Horg. Just before he
reached him he leaped into the air; flexed his knees, drawing his
feet close to his body, and then with all his strength backed by
the momentum of his charge he kicked Horg with both feet full in
the face. The result was astonishing&mdash;especially to Horg. He
turned a complete back somersault, landed on his head, and
dropped face down in the dirt.</p>

<p>Groggy and only half conscious, he staggered slowly to his
feet. Von Horst was waiting for him. "Have you had enough?" he
asked. He did not wish to punish the man further in the condition
he was in. The crowd was yelling encouragement to him; and with
the fickleness and cruelty of crowds was jeering at its fallen
champion. Grum, seeing her hopes about to be realized, screamed
at the top of her voice as she urged von Horst to finish the
almost helpless man; but Horg would not give in.</p>

<p>Perhaps he heard Grum and preferred death. He lunged for his
lighter antagonist, growling beast-like.</p>

<p>"I kill!" he screamed.</p>

<p>Thus was von Horst compelled to continue, for he knew that
Horg had uttered no idle threat. If the fellow could get those
great paws on him, get one good hold, he would kill him. In both
his hands he seized one of the outstretched wrists, swung quickly
around, bent suddenly forward, and hurled the mighty man over his
head&mdash;a trick of jujitsu far simpler than it appeared to the
amazed onlookers. Horg fell heavily and lay still. Von Horst
approached and stood over him. There were cries of "Kill him!
Kill him!" for the blood-lust of these primitive savages was
aroused, stimulated perhaps by the <i>tumal</i> they had
drunk.</p>

<p>Von Horst turned to Mamth. "Have I won?" he asked.</p>

<p>The chief nodded. "You have won," he said.</p>

<p>The victor looked at Grum. "Here is your mate," he said. "Come
and take him."</p>

<p>The woman ran forward and fell upon the prostrate Horg,
beating and kicking him. Von Horst turned away in disgust. The
others, laughing, returned to the food and the <i>tumal</i>.</p>

<p>Thorek came and slapped von Horst on the back. "I told them
you were a great warrior," he exulted.</p>

<p>"You should know," said von Horst with a grin.</p>

<p>"Come and join the <i>karoo</i>," said Thorek. "You have had
nothing to eat or drink. That is not the way to make
<i>karoo</i>."</p>

<p>"Why should I make <i>karoo</i>?" demanded von Horst. "I do
not even know what is being celebrated."</p>

<p>"They have captured Old White, The Killer. That is something
to celebrate. There never was such a wise old mammoth, nor one as
large. After the next sleep we shall start training him, and when
he is trained Mamth will ride him. He is a fit mammoth for a
chief."</p>

<p>"I should like to see him trained," remarked von Horst; for he
thought it might be an interesting occasion if Old White
objected, which he was sure that he would.</p>

<p>"I'll ask Mamth if you can come," said Thorek. "It will
probably be after the next sleep. Every one will wish to sleep
after the <i>karoo</i>."</p>

<p>The two men talked for awhile, exchanging experiences that had
befallen them since they had separated; then Thorek wandered away
to drink with his fellows, and von Horst sought out Lotai.
Together they watched the celebration, which was by this time
loud and boisterous. Fights were more numerous, the laughter
deafening. Usually dignified old warriors were performing foolish
antics and laughing uproariously at themselves. Many of the women
were thick tongued and bleary eyed. As von Horst watched them he
was struck by the very obvious fact that human nature had
undergone little or no change from the stone age to the present
time. Except for the difference in language and apparel these
might be people from any present-day country of the outer crust.
Presently he saw Grum approaching unsteadily. For the moment she
had relaxed surveillance over her new mate. Von Horst attracted
her attention and beckoned to her.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten our bargain?" inquired the man.</p>

<p>"What bargain?" she asked.</p>

<p>"If I got Horg for you, you were to help me escape."</p>

<p>"When they are asleep after the <i>karoo</i> I will show you
the way, but you cannot go now. The <i>tarags</i> would get you.
After the prisoners are taken to the little canyon, the
<i>tarags</i> will be gone; then you could go."</p>

<p>"It will be too late then," he said, "for I am to go to the
little canyon; and if I have surmised correctly from what I have
heard, I shall not return."</p>

<p>"No," she admitted with a shrug, "you will not. But I promised
to show you how you might escape. It is the only way I know; if
you can't use it, that is not my fault." Then she staggered away
in search of Horg, and von Horst returned to Lotai.</p>

<p>The celebration dragged on&mdash;interminably, it seemed to
von Horst; but at last those who could still walk reeled to their
caves to sleep.</p>

<p>Horg had drunk himself into a stupor, and Grum was beating him
over the head with a stick in an effort either to punish or
arouse him&mdash;perhaps to kill him. Von Horst could not guess
which.</p>

<p>Lotai, Mumal, and Gorph were climbing to their caves&mdash;the
last so befuddled that climbing the ladder toward his ledge
seemed to von Horst almost to verge upon suicide.</p>

<p>The European passed close to Grum. "They are all going to
their caves to sleep," he whispered. "Now is your chance to tell
me."</p>

<p>"Go to the ledge before Gorph's cave, and wait there for
me."</p>

<p>As he climbed the ladders toward the ledge he could hear Grum
berating Horg as she beat him, and he smiled as he speculated on
the similarity between the people of the old stone age and those
of modern-day civilization. The principal difference seemed to
lie in the matter of inhibitions. He had known women of the outer
crust who were like Grum&mdash;their thoughts were taloned.</p>

<p>He sat down upon the ledge to wait. He was quite alone. The
others had gone into the cave to sleep. He though of Lotai and
the sad lives that she and Mumal led. He thought too of La-ja,
and these thoughts were sad thoughts. It seemed strange that this
little savage should have won to such a place in his life that a
future without her loomed dull and grey. Could it be that he
loved her? He sought to analyze his feelings that he might refute
such a theory, but he only arrived at another sigh with the
realization that no matter what logic he brought to bear the fact
remained that her passing from his life had left an emptiness
that hurt.</p>

<p>Presently Grum came. Her little eyes were blood-shot, her
frowzy hair at its frowziest. She was the personification of a
stench, both morally and physically.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I guess Horg knows that he has a mate."</p>

<p>"Why did you beat him?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"You've got to start right with them," she explained. "If you
give them the least little toe-hold you're lost, just as Mumal
is."</p>

<p>He nodded in understanding of her philosophy; for, again, he
had known women of the outer crust who were like her. Perhaps
their technique was more refined, but their aim was identical.
Marriage to them, meant a struggle for supremacy. It was a 50-50
proposition of their own devising&mdash;they took fifty and
demanded the other fifty.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "tell me how I may escape."</p>

<p>"There is a hole in the rear of Gorph's cave," explained Grum.
"It drops down a few feet into a tunnel. When I was a little girl
Gorph was beating me. I broke away and hid in this hole. I knew
he would not dare to follow me, because he had always told us
that this tunnel led to the Molop Az. Gorph chased me and tried
to get hold of me, reaching into the hole to seize me; so I had
to move back into the tunnel to escape him. He threatened to kill
me when I came out&mdash;if I didn't fall into the Molop Az and
get burned up.</p>

<p>"I was very much afraid of Gorph then when I was a little
girl. When this happened he had been drinking too much
<i>tumal</i>, and I knew that if I came out he really would kill
me; so I determined to stay where I was until I thought he was
asleep.</p>

<p>"Then I got to thinking about Molop Az. Perhaps I could go far
enough in the tunnel to see it and return safely. After all it
didn't make much difference to me if I did fall into it. Gorph
was very cruel, and sooner or later he was sure to kill me. Of
that I was convinced; so I thought I might as well take a chance
with the Molop Az. Being young, I was very curious. The more I
thought about it the more I wished to investigate it. I decided
to follow the tunnel and see the Molop Az."</p>

<p>"What is the Molop Az?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"It is a sea of fire, Pellucidar floats upon it. We know that,
because there are places in Pellucidar where the smoke and fire
come up through the ground from the Molop Az. There are holes in
mountains where melted rock flows up.</p>

<p>"The dead that are buried in the ground are taken down bit by
bit by little demons and burned up in Molop Az. There is no doubt
about that because when we dig up a body that has been buried we
find that some of it has been carried away&mdash;perhaps all of
it."</p>

<p>"And did you find the Molop Az?"</p>

<p>She shook her head</p>

<p>"No. The tunnel does not lead to Molop Az; it leads to the
little canyon. From there, except at certain times, you could
easily make your escape from Ja-ru; just go up the canyon and
climb the cliff at the upper end. Beyond, you can drop down into
another canyon that leads out of our country into a country where
mammoth-men seldom if ever go."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"But you can't go now. The <i>tarags</i> would get you. They
are in the far end of the tunnel. They will be there until the
prisoners are taken to the little canyon."</p>

<p>"What is the little canyon?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise. "What would a little canyon be
but a little canyon?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"What happens there?"</p>

<p>"You will find out soon enough. Now I am going back to Horg.
You got him for me, and I have kept my promise. I don't know
whether he was worth the trouble, but at least I shall have a
cave of my own." She turned then and left him.</p>

<p>"At least I shall have a cave of my own!" von Horst grinned.
Evidently it was an immemorial custom that girls should wed to
escape their families.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; OLD WHITE</a></h2>

<p class="first">Below him the leaves of the trees moved to a
gentle breeze as von Horst came from the cave after sleeping. The
air was fresh and clear, and the breeze was cool, tempering the
heat of the high sun, as though it blew across the snow of far
mountains. The man looked about him and saw that life was astir
again in the cliff village of the mammoth-men. He heard his name
called from below and saw Thorek beckoning to him to come down.
Gorph had to yet come from the cave; so von Horst descended and
joined Thorek at the foot of the cliff. Many warriors were
assembling. Mamth was there, and though he saw von Horst he paid
no attention to him. "We are going to train Old White," said
Thorek.</p>

<p>"Mamth has said that you may come with us. You may ride with
me upon my mammoth."</p>

<p>Presently the herd appeared, driven by herders mounted on
their great beasts. These were all well trained mammoths, and
they moved quietly and obediently. When all the warriors were
mounted Mamth led the way up the main canyon. The gorges that ran
into it were mostly narrow with steep, rocky sides. Before the
entrance to one of them Mamth halted. The opening into the gorge
was very narrow and across it were bars each of which was a good
size tree. The top bar was roped securely into place by a large
rope that had been made by braiding long grass. Warriors removed
the rope; and two of the mammoths, directed by their riders,
lifted the bars and removed them; then the party filed into the
gorge. Beyond the entrance it widened and the floor was level.
They had ridden up it but a short distance when von Horst saw a
huge mammoth standing in the shade of a tree. It was swaying to
and fro on its great feet, its head and trunk undulating to the
cadence of its swaying body. On its left jowl was a patch of
white hair. It was Old White, the Killer. Von Horst would have
recognized the huge beast among hundreds of its kind.</p>

<p>At sight of the party the animal raised its trunk and
screamed. The rocky hills trembled to the giant's warning. It
started toward them, and then von Horst saw that one of its feet
was secured to a great log. It could move about, but the log
prevented it from moving rapidly. Two mammoths were ridden in on
either side of Old White. When he attempted to raise his trunk to
seize the riders the other mammoths caught and held it with
theirs, and it required the combined strength of the two to do
it.</p>

<p>Now a third warrior rode close and clambered over the back of
one of the tame mammoths to sit astride Old White's neck, and the
close contact of the man threw the captive into a fury.
Trumpeting and bellowing, he sought to escape from the beasts
that pressed close on either side. He fought to raise his trunk
and snatch the man-thing from him as he lurched erratically about
the floor of the gorge dragging the great log in his wake.</p>

<p>Old White, the Killer, was wise with great age; and when he
realized that he could accomplish nothing by force he suddenly
became quiet and apparently as docile as a lamb; then commenced
his training. The rider struck him a sharp blow with the flat of
his hand on his back just behind where the warrior sat, and
simultaneously a mammoth in his rear and those on either side of
him pushed him forward. A blow on the head in front of the rider
was a signal to stop, and the three great training mammoths
stopped him. Time and again he was rehearsed in these movements;
then he was taught to turn to the right or left by a kick on the
opposite jowl. Old White learned quickly. Mamth was delighted.
Here, indeed, was a powerful and intelligent beast worthy to be
the mount of a chief. The trainers watched Old White carefully,
his ears, his tail, his trunk, his eyes, for these were the
indices of his temper; and they all proclaimed resignation and
docility.</p>

<p>"Never have I seen a wild mammoth subdued so easily or taught
so quickly," exclaimed Mamth. "He is already trained. Let him be
ridden alone now without the other mammoths. Later we will remove
the log."</p>

<p>The riders withdrew the other three mammoths to a short
distance from Old White; and the great beast stood gently
swinging his trunk to and fro, a picture of contentment and
docility. The young warrior riding him struck him sharply on the
back, signaling him to move forward. As quickly as a snake
strikes, Old White swung his trunk up and seized his rider; and
simultaneously he was transformed into a raging devil of hate and
fury.</p>

<p>Screaming with rage, he raised the struggling warrior high
above his head; then he dashed him heavily to the ground in front
of him. The three warriors who had been assisting with his
training urged their mounts in, but too late. Old White placed a
great foot on the warrior and trampled him into the earth. Then
he seized the warrior on the nearest mount and hurled him across
the gorge, and all the while he trumpeted and bellowed. As he
lunged for another of the warriors the two turned their mammoths
and retreated; but Old White pursued them, dragging the heavy log
after him. That was the end of the mighty captive's training.
Mamth, disappointed and angry, ordered all from the gorge, the
bars of the gate were replaced; and they rode back down the
canyon toward the village.</p>

<p>Von Horst had been an interested spectator, his interest
augmented because of his former remarkable experience with Old
White. His sympathies were with the mammoth, and he was secretly
pleased by the manner in which the wise old beast had completely
deceived his captors and won at least a partial revenge for the
sufferings and indignities that he had been subjected to.</p>

<p>Von Horst had also been interested in learning the method used
by the mammoth-men in controlling their ponderous mounts; and as
they left the gorge he asked Thorek if he might pilot the animal
the two were riding; and Thorek, amused, consented. Thus he
acquired an accomplishment that appeared quite as useless as
anything that he had ever learned in his life.</p>

<p>"Will you ever be able to tame Old White?" he asked.</p>

<p>Thorek shook his head. "Not unless Mamth is crazy," he
replied, "will he ever risk another warrior on that brute. He is
a natural killer. Such as he are never tamed. He has killed many
warriors, and knowing how easy it is to kill us he would never be
safe."</p>

<p>"What will become of him?"</p>

<p>"He will be destroyed, but not before he has afforded the
tribe some entertainment." They rode on in silence. Von Horst's
thoughts were rummaging in the attic of memory rediscovering many
a half forgotten souvenir. Bold and fresh and clear among them
was the figure of La-ja. He turned his face a little toward
Thorek.</p>

<p>"Lotai is a fine girl," he said.</p>

<p>Thorek looked surprised, and scowled. "What do you know of
Lotai?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am quartered in Gorph's cave." Thorek grunted.</p>

<p>"Lotai will make some warrior a good mate," ventured von
Horst.</p>

<p>"He will have to fight me," said Thorek.</p>

<p>Von Horst smiled. "Grum has a mate," he said. "Whoever takes
Lotai will not have to take Grum, too. He will only have to fight
you. But I did not know that you cared. Lotai does not know that
you care."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"She said so."</p>

<p>"Do you want her?" demanded Thorek.</p>

<p>"She is very desirable, but she loves another."</p>

<p>"And you are afraid to fight him?"</p>

<p>"No," replied von Horst "I am not afraid to fight him. I have
already done so and beaten him."</p>

<p>"And you have mated with her?" Thorek's tone sounded like the
growl of a beast.</p>

<p>"No. I know that she loves him."</p>

<p>"Who is he? He'll not have her. I'll kill him. Who is he? Tell
me."</p>

<p>"You," said von Horst, grinning.</p>

<p>Thorek looked very foolish. "You are sure?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Positive. She has told me."</p>

<p>"Before the next sleep I shall ask Mamth, and I shall take
Lotai to my cave."</p>

<p>"Do you have to ask Mamth?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is chief."</p>

<p>"Ask him now," suggested von Horst.</p>

<p>"As well now as later," agreed Thorek. He urged his mount
forward until he rode abreast of Mamth.</p>

<p>"I would like Lotai, the daughter of Gorph, to be my mate," he
said to the chief.</p>

<p>Mamth scowled. "No," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Thorek. "I am a great warrior. I have no mate.
I want Lotai."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Mamth.</p>

<p>Thorek flushed. He was about to make some rejoinder when von
Horst put a warning finger to his own lips and slowed the mammoth
down until it had again taken its place in the column.</p>

<p>"I have a plan," said von Horst.</p>

<p>"What sort of a plan?" asked Thorek.</p>

<p>"A plan whereby you may get Lotai and at the same time do
something that will make her very happy."</p>

<p>"And what is that?"</p>

<p>"She and her mother, Mumal, are very unhappy here. Mumal
wishes to return to Sari, the country from which Gorph stole her;
and Lotai wishes to go with her."</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do about it?" demanded Thorek.</p>

<p>"You can take them. It is the only way that you can get
Lotai."</p>

<p>"I cannot take them," said Thorek. "I could never get them out
of the village."</p>

<p>"Would you go to Sari with them if you could?"</p>

<p>"I would only be killed by the men of Sari."</p>

<p>"The Sarians would not kill you. Mumal is a Sarian, and I have
a friend named Dangar who would see that you were taken into the
tribe. He would do anything that I asked."</p>

<p>"It is useless," insisted Thorek. "I could never leave the
village with two women."</p>

<p>"Would you, if you could?" demanded von Horst.</p>

<p>"Yes; if Lotai would go with me I would go anywhere."</p>

<p>"In the back of Gorph's cave there is an opening into a
tunnel."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know of it; it leads to Molop Az."</p>

<p>"It leads to the little canyon. When the tarags at the other
end are gone you may go out that way with Lotai and Mumal."</p>

<p>"How do you know that it leads to the little canyon?" demanded
Thorek.</p>

<p>"I have talked with one who went through it as far as the
place where the tarags are."</p>

<p>Thorek rode in silence for a time before he spoke again. The
party came to the village and dismounted. The herders drove the
mammoths away. Mamth was irritable and glum. He turned on von
Horst.</p>

<p>"Get to Gorph's cave," he ordered, "and stay there. Perhaps
before the next sleep we shall take you to the little
canyon."</p>

<p>"That is the end for you, my friend," said Thorek. "I am
sorry. I thought that perhaps we might find a way for you to go
with us to Sari; but the way will not be open, the tarags will
not be gone until after you have been taken to the little canyon;
then it will be too late."</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged. "There is not very much that one can do
about it," he said.</p>

<p>"There is nothing," asserted Thorek.</p>

<p>He walked on beside von Horst toward the ladder that led
upward to Gorph's cave. "Perhaps this is the last time that we
shall talk together," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed von Horst.</p>

<p>"Will you speak to Lotai for me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. What shall I say?"</p>

<p>"Ask her if she will go with me to Sari, she and Mumal. If she
will, raise your right arm straight toward the sun when next you
see me. If she will not, raise your left arm. I shall be
watching. If they will go, tell them that when the others go to
the little canyon, they must hide. I will do the same, and after
all are gone we can enter the tunnel and go as far as the tarags.
When the tribe has left the little canyon, we can come out and go
away in search of Sari."</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said von Horst. They had reached the foot of the
ladder. "Goodbye and good luck. I will speak to Lotai as soon as
possible." Von Horst found Lotai and Mumal alone in front of the
cave, and immediately explained the plan that he and Thorek had
discussed. Both women were delighted, and they sat for a long
time planning on the future. Presently Gorph came and demanded
food. As usual he was surly and brutal. He glowered and growled
at von Horst.</p>

<p>"I shall not have to feed you again," he said. "Mamth has
spoken, and soon all will be in readiness in the little canyon.
You will be taken there with the other prisoners, and you will
not come back."</p>

<p>"I shall miss you, Gorph," said von Horst.</p>

<p>The mammoth-man looked at him in stupid amazement. "I shall
not miss you," he said.</p>

<p>"I shall miss your pleasant ways and your hospitality."</p>

<p>"You are a fool," said Gorph. He gobbled his food and arose.
"I am going into the cave to sleep," he said. "If word is passed
that we are going to the little canyon, wake me."</p>

<p>As he crossed to enter the cave he aimed a vicious kick at
Lotai, which she dodged by rolling quickly out of the way. "Why
don't you get a man?" he demanded. "I am sick of seeing you
around; I am tired of feeding you;" then he passed on into the
cave.</p>

<p>The three sat in silence. They dared not plan for fear they
might be overheard. The thoughts of the women were filled with
happiness&mdash;thoughts of escape, of Sari, of love, and of
happiness. The man thought not of the future but of the
past&mdash;of the world of his birth, of his friends, and his
family, of a beautiful girl who had touched his life briefly and
yet had filled it. There was no future for him&mdash;only a brief
interval of uncertainty and then death. A young man climbed
agilely up the ladders to the ledge before Gorph's cave. He
halted and surveyed the three, his eyes resting on Lotai.</p>

<p>"You are to go to the cave of Mamth," he said. "He has chosen
you to be his mate."</p>

<p>Lotai turned very white; her wide eyes were horror filled. She
tried to speak; but she only gasped, her fingers clutching at her
throat.</p>

<p>Von Horst looked at the messenger. "Tell Mamth that Lotai has
been ill," he said, "but that she will come presently."</p>

<p>"She had better not be long," warned the man, "if she doesn't
want a beating."</p>

<p>After he had departed the three sat whispering together for
some time; then Lotai arose and went into the cave. Von Horst and
Mumal remained where they were for a short time; then they too,
feeling the urge to sleep, went into the cave.</p>

<p>Von Horst was awakened by loud voices outside the cave; then
Gorph entered, calling Lotai. There was no reply. Von Horst sat
up.</p>

<p>"Lotai is not here," he said. "Don't make so much noise; I
want to sleep."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" demanded Gorph. "She has got to be here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but she is not. Mamth sent for her to come to his
cave. Go and inquire of Mamth where she is."</p>

<p>Two warriors entered the cave. "She did not come to Mamth's
cave." said one of them. "He sent us to fetch her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps something happened to her," suggested von Horst.</p>

<p>The two, with Gorph, searched the cave. They questioned Mumal,
but she only replied as had von Horst that Mamth had sent for
Lotai. At last they departed, and the others followed them to the
ledge. Presently von Horst saw a number of warriors commence a
search of the village. They searched every cave, but they did not
find Lotai. Von Horst could see Mamth standing among the trees at
the foot of the cliff, and he guessed from his gestures that he
was very angry. Nor was he mistaken. Presently the chief came
himself to the cave of Gorph and searched it; and he questioned
Gorph, and Mumal, and von Horst. He wanted to blame one or all of
them, but he had no evidence to support him. He stopped in front
of von Horst, scowling.</p>

<p>"You are bad luck," he said, "but it will not be for
long&mdash;we go now to the little canyon."</p>

<p>To the little canyon! The end of his adventure in Pellucidar
was approaching. Well, what of it? One must die. It is little
easier one time than another. Even the very old and hopeless
cling tenaciously to life. They may not wish to, but they cannot
help it&mdash;it is just another of Nature's immutable laws.</p>

<p>He followed the warriors down the ladders to the foot of the
cliff. Here the clan was gathering, men, women, and children. A
herd of mammoths was being driven into the village; and the great
beasts were lifting men, women, and children to their backs. Von
Horst looked about in search of Thorek, but he could not find
him; then he was ordered to the back of a mammoth, where he sat
behind a warrior. He saw Frug on another beast, as well as other
prisoners similarly mounted. There were men from Amdar, from Go-
hal, from Lo-har. Von Horst had never met any of the other
prisoners except Frug; but he had heard them spoken of by Mumal,
Grum, and Lotai. He would have been glad to have talked with the
man from Lo-har, because that was La-ja's country. Because of
that he felt closer to him. His heart might have warmed even to
the redoubtable Gaz.</p>

<p>Presently he caught sight of Thorek. He was standing at one
side among the trees staring steadily at von Horst; and the
instant that the man from the outer crust caught his eye, he
raised his right arm aloft toward the sun.</p>

<p>Thorek nodded and turned away. Immediately thereafter Mamth
moved off upon his great mount, and the others followed. The
hairy warriors with their women and children, the monstrous
beasts that bore them, presented a picture of primitive savagery
that thrilled von Horst despite its sinister connotation. It was
indeed an inspiring prelude to death. He looked about him. Riding
beside and almost abreast of him, he discovered Gorph alone upon
the back of his mammoth.</p>

<p>"Where is Mumal?" inquired von Horst.</p>

<p>Gorph looked at him and scowled. "She is sick," he said. "I
hope she dies; then I could get me a good mate. I will not hunt
for two of them and their brats."</p>

<p>Presently the trail wound up the side of the canyon to the
summit of a ridge that paralleled a steep-sided canyon. Here the
tribe dismounted, turning the mammoths over to the herders; after
which the men, women, and children ranged themselves along the
edge of the canyon which formed an amphitheater below them.</p>

<p>"This," said the warrior with whom von Horst had ridden, "is
the little canyon."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; THE LITTLE
CANYON</a></h2>

<p class="first">At the edge of the canyon was a ledge along
which the members of the tribe pressed to obtain a view of the
floor of the canyon some thirty feet below. At the upper end of
the canyon a massive corral had been built in which were several
mammoths, and in the wall opposite the spectators a cave entrance
was barred with small timbers. As von Horst stood looking down
into the little canyon, Horg came carrying a rope in one end of
which was a noose. "Stick your leg through this," he said to von
Horst, "and hold on tight."</p>

<p>Two other warriors approached and took hold of the rope with
the first. "Get over the edge," directed Horg. "Your troubles
will soon be over. I would almost like to change places with
you."</p>

<p>Von Horst grinned. "No thanks," he said. "I know when I'm well
off."</p>

<p>"When you reach the bottom, step out of the rope," instructed
Horg; then the three lowered him to the floor of the canyon.</p>

<p>As they pulled the rope up again they tossed down a stone
knife and a stone tipped spear; then they lowered another
prisoner. It was Frug.</p>

<p>The chief of the Basti glowered at von Horst. "You've got me
into a nice mess," he growled.</p>

<p>"You are rationalizing, my friend," replied von Horst. "You
are also passing the buck, as my American friends so quaintly put
it; all of which confirms an opinion I have long held&mdash;that
styles in whiskers and bowler hats may change, but human nature
never."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"It is quite immaterial. If I am any sort of a judge, nothing
that we may or think down here at the bottom of the little canyon
will ever be material to anyone, not even to ourselves." From
above were dropped weapons for Frug; and then, one by one, the
three remaining prisoners were lowered and armed. The five doomed
men stood in a little group waiting for death, wondering,
perhaps, in what form the grim reaper would present himself. They
were stalwart men, all; and each in his own mind had doubtless
determined to sell his life as dearly as possible. The fact that
they had been armed must have held out a faint hope that they
might be given a chance, however slender, to win life and freedom
in combat.</p>

<p>Von Horst was scrutinizing the three he had not previously
seen. "Which of you is from Lo-har?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am from Lo-har," said the youngest of the three. "Why do
you ask?"</p>

<p>"I have been long with a girl from Lo-har," replied von Horst.
"Together we escaped from Basti, where we were being held in
slavery. We were on our way to Lo-har when two men from Basti
stole her from me while I slept."</p>

<p>"Who was this girl?" inquired the man from Lo-har.</p>

<p>"La-ja."</p>

<p>The man whistled in surprise. "The daughter of Brun, the
Chief," he said. "Well, you are just as well off here as you
would have been had you succeeded in reaching Lo-har with
her."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded von Horst. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that you can only be killed here; and if you had
reached Lo-har with La-ja, Gaz would have killed you. He has been
on the warpath ever since La-ja disappeared. It is a good thing
for the Bastians that he did not know who stole her. Gaz is a
mighty man. Single handed he might destroy a whole tribe such as
the Bastians."</p>

<p>Gaz again! Von Horst was almost sorry that he was never to
have the opportunity to see this doughty warrior.</p>

<p>He turned to Frug. "The man from Lo-har doesn't think much of
you Bastians," he taunted.</p>

<p>"Is he a Bastian?" demanded the Lo-harian.</p>

<p>"He is the chief," explained von Horst.</p>

<p>"I am Daj of Lo-har," cried the young warrior. "You stole the
daughter of my chief, you eater of men. I kill!"</p>

<p>He leaped toward Frug, holding his stone-tipped spear like a
bayoneted rifle. Frug sprang back, parrying the first thrust. A
shout of approval rose from the savage audience on the ledge
above. Then the two men settled down to a stern relentless dual.
Frug outweighed his opponent by fifty pounds, but the other had
the advantage of youth and agility. The former sought to rush Daj
and bear him down by sheer physical weight, but Daj was too quick
for him. Each time, he leaped aside; and on Frug's third attempt,
Daj dodged as he had before; then he wheeled quickly and jabbed
his spear into the Bastian's side.</p>

<p>The mammoth-men shouted their approval. "Kill! Kill!" they
screamed. Frug roared with pain and rage, wheeled again and
lumbered down upon Daj. This time the Lo-harian stood his ground
until Frug was almost upon him; then he crouched suddenly beneath
the extended weapon of his adversary and thrust viciously upward
into the belly of the Bastian. As Frug writhed, screaming, upon
the ground, Daj wrenched his weapon from the other's belly and
plunged it through his heart. Thus died the Chief, Frug of Basti;
thus was La-ja avenged by one of her own clan.</p>

<p>Amidst the shouts and yells of the mammoth-men, the man from
Amdar shouted, "Look! Tarags! There," and pointed toward the
opposite side of the canyon.</p>

<p>With the others, von Horst looked. The grating that had been
before the entrance to the cave had been raised by warriors from
above, and now five great tarags were slinking onto the floor of
the canyon&mdash;five mighty, saber-toothed tigers.</p>

<p>"Tandors!" exclaimed the man from Go-hal. "They are turning
the tandors loose on us. They give us a spear and a knife to
fight tarags and tandors."</p>

<p>"They think well of us as fighting men," said von Horst,
grinning, as he glanced toward the upper end of the canyon and
saw that the mammoths had been released from the corral.</p>

<p>There were five mammoths, bulls that were untamable killers.
One of them towered above his fellows, a huge monster, bellowing
angrily as it caught the scent of the tarags and the men. The
five moved ponderously down toward the center of the canyon,
while the great cats crossed directly toward the five men
awaiting their doom. Thus the paths of the beasts seemed certain
to meet before the tarags reached the men. But one of the latter
trotted ahead, so that it seemed apparent that it would cross in
front of the mammoths and reach the four prisoners without
interruption.</p>

<p>Von Horst was sufficiently familiar with the tempers of both
mammoths and tigers to know that, being hereditary enemies, they
would attack one another if they came in contact. Just what this
would mean to himself and his fellow prisoners he could only
guess. Perhaps enough of them might be disabled in the ensuing
battle to permit the men to dispatch those that were not killed.
Whether or not they would be any better off then, he did not
know. It might be that those who survived would be released. He
asked Daj of Lo-har about it.</p>

<p>"The mammoth-men never let a prisoner escape if they can help
it," replied Daj. "If we are not killed by the beasts, we shall
be killed in some other way."</p>

<p>"If we can reach the upper end of the canyon," said von Horst,
"we may be able to escape. I see a little trail there running
from beside the corral to the summit. I have been told that if we
can escape in that way the mammoth-men will not pursue us, as it
would take them into a country that, for some reason, they never
enter."</p>

<p>"The tarags and the tandors will never permit us to reach the
upper end of the canyon," replied Daj.</p>

<p>The tarag that was in the lead was preparing to charge. He
crouched low, now, and crept forward. His sinuous tail twitched
nervously. His blazing eyes were fixed upon von Horst who stood a
little in advance of his fellows. Behind this tarag the others
had met the tandors. The canyon thundered to the roaring and
trumpeting and screaming of the challenging beasts.</p>

<p>"Run for the upper end of the canyon," von Horst called back
to his companions. "Some of you may escape."</p>

<p>The tarag charged, his lips stretched in a hideous snarl that
bared his great saber teeth to the gums, his jaws distended.
Roaring, he charged upon the puny man-thing. Once before had von
Horst stopped the charge of a tarag with a stone-tipped spear.
That time he had accorded the palm to luck. It seemed incredible
that such luck would hold again. Yet, had it been wholly luck?
Skill and strength and iron nerve had been contributing factors
in his victory. Would they hold again against this devil-faced
demon?</p>

<p>As the tarag rose in its final spring, von Horst dropped to
one knee and planted the butt of the spear firmly against the
ground. He was very cool and deliberate, though he had to move
with lightning speed. He held the point of the spear forward,
aiming it at the broad white chest of the saber-tooth; then, as
the beast struck, the man rolled to one side, leaping quickly to
his feet.</p>

<p>The spear sank deep into the chest of the tarag, and with a
hideous scream the beast rolled in the dust of the canyon floor.
But it was up again in an instant seeking with ferocious growls
and terrifying roars the author of its hurt. It turned its
terrible eyes upon von Horst and tried to reach him; but the butt
of the spear, sticking into the ground, drove the point farther
into its body; and it stopped to claw at the offending object.
Its roars, now, were deafening; but von Horst saw that it was
reduced to nothing more menacing than noise and looked about him
to see what chance he had to reach the upper end of the canyon.
His companions were moving in that direction. To his right, the
tarags and mammoths were engaged in a titanic struggle. Three of
the former had centered their attack upon the smallest of the
bulls. The other four bulls stood in a little group, tail to
tail, while the remaining tarag, the largest of the five, circled
them.</p>

<p>Von Horst moved in the direction of the upper end of the
canyon. He hoped that he might go unnoticed by the beasts, but
the great tarag that was circling the four bulls saw him. It
stopped in its tracks, eyeing him; and then it came for him. No
longer was there a spear with which to dispute the outcome of the
encounter with the fanged and taloned beast&mdash;the outcome
that now must be a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>The man gauged the distance to the end of the canyon. Could he
reach it before the mighty carnivore overtook him? He doubted it.
Then he saw the huge bull that he had noticed before break from
the group and start forward as though to intercept the tarag. Von
Horst imagined that the tandor thought the great cat was trying
to escape him and was thus emboldened to pursue and attack.</p>

<p>Now there might be a chance to escape. If the mammoth overtook
the saber-tooth before the latter reached von Horst; or if the
saber-tooth's charge were diverted by a threatened attack by the
mammoth; then he might easily reach safety while all of the
animals in the canyon were occupied with one another. With this
slender hope to speed him on, he started to run. But the tarag
was not to be denied this easy prey. It paid no attention to the
mammoth as it continued on in pursuit of the man. Von Horst,
glancing back across a shoulder, was astounded by the terrific
speed of the huge mammoth. Like a thorough-bred, it raced to head
off the carnivore. The latter gained rapidly upon von Horst. It
was a question which would reach him first, and to the man it
seemed only a question as to the manner of his death. Would he
die with those terrible talons at his vitals, or would he be
tossed high in air and then trampled beneath tons of prehistoric
flesh?</p>

<p>Upon the rim of the canyon the savage cave-men were howling
their delight and approval of this exciting race with death.
Mamth had discovered that three of his prisoners had located the
path at the upper end of the canyon and were on their way to
freedom. That the path was not guarded was due to the fact that
the mammoth-men believed that no one but themselves knew of it,
and it was so faintly traced upon the canyon's wall that no one
who did not know of its existence could have discovered it.</p>

<p>But now that Mamth saw that the three had reached the end of
the canyon and started to ascend, he hurriedly sent warriors to
intercept them. Whether they would reach the head of the canyon
in time to do so was problematical.</p>

<p>Below, on the floor of the canyon, the tarag leaped to seize
von Horst. The savage beast was apparently either indifferent to
the close proximity of the mammoth racing now parallel with it,
or else it sought to wrest the prey from its competitor. Then a
strange thing happened. The mammoth's trunk shot out with
lightning speed and circled the body of the tarag, halting its
spring in mid-air. Once the mighty Titan swung the screaming,
clawing creature to and fro; then, with all its great strength,
it hurled it high in the air and to one side.</p>

<p>Whether by intent or chance it hurled it to the rim of the
canyon among the spectators, scattering them in all directions.
Infuriated, and only slightly injured, the tarag charged among
the fleeing tribesmen, striking them down to right and left.</p>

<p>But none of this von Horst witnessed. He was too much
engrossed with his own perilous adventure. And perilous it
seemed. For no sooner had the mammoth disposed of the tarag than
it encircled the man with its powerful trunk and lifted him high
in the air. To von Horst it signified the end. He breathed a
silent prayer that it might be soon over and without suffering.
As the beast wheeled he had a fleeting glimpse of the melee on
the ledge above&mdash;the mad tarag, a score of spearmen rallying
courageously to meet its savage attack; then he saw the three
tarags and the four mammoths engaged in a terrific battle to the
accompaniment of trumpeting, screams, growls, and roars that were
almost deafening.</p>

<p>The bull that was carrying him aloft moved straight down the
canyon at a shuffling trot. Von Horst wondered why he had not
been tossed or trampled. Was the creature playing with him to
prolong his torture? What was in the sagacious brain of the
ponderous monster? Now the trunk curled back, and to von Horst's
amazement he was lowered gently to the beast's neck. For a moment
the trunk held him there until he gained his equilibrium; then it
was removed.</p>

<p>Past the madly battling beasts the mammoth bore von Horst
toward the lower end of the little canyon. The man settled
himself more firmly back of the great ears which he grasped as
additional support, and as he did so he chanced to glance down.
Upon the mammoth's left jowl grew a patch of white hair!</p>

<p><i>Ah Ara, ma Rahna</i>&mdash;Old White, the Killer! Could it
be that the great beast recognized him? Was it repaying the man
for the service he had rendered it? Von Horst could scarcely
believe this; yet, why else had it refrained from killing him?
What was it doing now other than seeking to save him?</p>

<p>Von Horst was well aware of the great sagacity of these huge
beasts and the unusual wisdom ascribed to Old White by the
mammoth-men; so it was this knowledge and the hope that springs
eternal that tended to convince him against his better judgment
that he had found a faithful friend and a mighty ally. But what
might it avail him? They were still trapped in the little canyon
in which blood-mad beasts battled to the death. If he were at the
upper end of the canyon, he might escape by the trail; but he was
not&mdash;he was being borne toward the lower end across which
was a massive gate of logs.</p>

<p>That Old White was seeking escape from the canyon in this
direction was soon evident. He was directing his shuffling trot
straight for the barrier. Now, as he approached it, he increased
his gait; and as he came within fifty feet of it, he lowered his
head and charged.</p>

<p>Von Horst was aghast. Ahead, upon the instant of impact with
the logs of the barrier, lay death for both of them. He thought
of slipping from the back of the charging beast. But why? Death
beneath the fangs and talons of the great cats might be far more
hideous than that which lay just ahead&mdash;the terrific impact
and then oblivion. There would be no suffering.</p>

<p>The mammoth seems a slow moving, ungainly animal; but it is
far from such. Now, in the full rush of its charge, Old White
bore down upon the gate of logs with the speed of an express
train&mdash;a living battering ram of incalculable power. Von
Horst lay flat, his arms hooked beneath the great ears. He waited
for the end, and he had faced so many dangers in savage
Pellucidar since he disembarked from the O-220 that he was not
greatly concerned by the imminence of death. Perhaps, now that he
had lost La-ja, it would be a welcome surcease of constant
battling for survival. After all, was life worth this unremitting
strife?</p>

<p>It was all over in a split second. The mighty skull crashed
into the heavy barrier. Logs, splintered like matchwood, flew in
all directions. The great beast stumbled to its knees over the
lower bars, nearly unseating the man; then caught itself and
rushed from the little canyon to freedom.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; BISON-
MEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">That he was free seemed almost incredible to von
Horst. A veritable miracle, the reward for his humane treatment
of his giant savior, had wrought his salvation in an extremity
from which only a miracle might have saved him. But what of the
future? He had a mount, but what could he do about it? Where was
it taking him? Could he control it? Could he even escape it? And
if he did, where was he to go? He knew now that there was
practically no hope that he might ever find Sari. Even though he
might retrace his steps to The Forest of Death, through which he
must pass to pick up Dangar's trail, he knew that it would be
suicidal to enter that grim and forbidding wood. He would have
liked to make his way to Lo-har because that was La-ja's country.
From the point at which he had left The Forest of Death he knew
the general direction of Lo-har, and so he decided that when he
was again a free agent he would seek out the land of La-ja. There
might always be at least the hope that she found her way there.
That she could, though, through this fearsome land of grotesque
and terrible dangers appeared such a remote possibility as to
verge closely upon the impossible.</p>

<p>And how was he to reach it even though chance might put him on
the right trail? He was unarmed except for the crude stone knife
the mammoth-men had given him and the now useless belt of
cartridges which he had clung to for some reason almost as
inexplicable as the fact that his captors had not taken it from
him.</p>

<p>It is true that the time he had spent in Pellucidar and his
increased knowledge of her ways had given him greater confidence
in his ability to take care of himself, but it had also impressed
upon him a healthy respect for the dangers that he knew must
confront him. So much for the future. How about the present?</p>

<p>Old White had reduced his speed and was ambling down the main
canyon away from the village of the mammoth-men and the little
canyon. No sign of pursuit had developed, and von Horst thought
it probable that the tribesmen had been so occupied with the
saber-toothed tiger rampant among them that they had failed to
notice the sudden departure of Old White and himself.</p>

<p>Presently the mammoth came out of the foot-hills and set its
course down toward the river upon the banks of which von Horst
had come upon it and where he had later been captured by the
mammoth-men. The gentle slope of the plain ahead was dotted with
feeding animals, sight of which raised the question in von
Horst's mind as to how he was to procure food with only a stone
knife as a weapon. He was also concerned with the destination of
Old White. Were the animal to leave him in the open plain he
might never pass through these great herds to the trees by the
river, and he must reach the sanctuary of trees if he were to
have even a chance for survival. There he could find partial
concealment and the materials for the bow and arrows and the
spear he must have to wage the eternal battle for life which
constitutes the whole existence of man in that savage world.</p>

<p>But now Old White was veering off to the left on a course
parallel to the river. Von Horst did not want to go in that
direction, for the country lay open and only sparsely treed as
far as the eye could reach. Trees, plenty of them, trees beside
water he must reach.</p>

<p>He had witnessed the unsuccessful attempt to tame Old White.
He had seen him obey the signals of his rider before he killed
him, and he wondered if the great beast remembered what he had
learned; or, remembering, if he would obey. Perhaps an attempt to
guide him would recall to the mammoth the indignities that had
been heaped upon him by his captors and the manner in which he
had rid himself of his last rider.</p>

<p>Von Horst hesitated a moment; then he shrugged and kicked Old
White with his left foot. Nothing happened. He kicked again
several times. Now the beast changed its direction toward the
right and von Horst kept on kicking until it was headed straight
for the river. Thereafter he kept the beast on this course by the
signals he had learned from the mammoth-men&mdash;that they had
both learned thus.</p>

<p>When the river was reached von Horst struck Old White a sharp
blow on top of the head, and the beast stopped; then the man
slipped to the ground. He wondered what the animal would do now,
but it did nothing&mdash;only stood placidly waving its trunk to
and fro. Von Horst stepped in front of its shoulder and stroked
its trunk. "Good boy," he said in quiet tones, as a man speaks to
his horse. Old White wound his trunk about the man gently; then
he released him, and von Horst walked away toward the trees and
the river. He lay down on his belly and drank, and the mammoth
came and drank beside him.</p>

<p>Von Horst could not know how long he remained there among the
trees beside the river. He caught fish and gathered nuts and
fruit and ate and slept several times; and he fashioned a bow and
arrows and a good, stout spear. He made his spear with a thought
to tarags. It was longer than the spears he had had before, but
not too long; and it was heavy. The wood of which it was made was
long-grained and pliant. It would not break easily.</p>

<p>While he was there he saw Old White often. The great beast fed
in a great patch of bamboo that grew beside the river only a
short distance from the tree in which von Horst had constructed a
rude shelter. Often, when not feeding, it came and stood beneath
the tree that housed the man. Upon such occasions von Horst made
it a point always to handle the beast and talk to it, for it
offered him the only companionship that he had. After awhile he
came to look forward to Old White's return, and worry a little if
he seemed gone over-long. It was a strange friendship, this
between a man and a mammoth; and in it von Horst thought he
recognized a parallel to the accidents that had resulted eons
before in the beginning of the domestication of animals upon the
outer crust.</p>

<p>His weapons completed, von Horst determined to set off upon
his search for Lo-har. He did not expect ever to find the
country, but he had to have an objective. It was just as likely
that he would stumble upon Sari as that he should find Lo-har,
but he could not simply remain where he was waiting for death by
accident or old age. Furthermore, a sense of humor as well as
curiosity impelled him to wish to see the fabulous Gaz.</p>

<p>Old White was standing under a nearby tree, out of the heat of
the noon-day sun, swaying gently to and fro; and von Horst walked
over to give him a final goodbye caress, for he had grown to be
genuinely fond of his gigantic friend and companion.</p>

<p>"I'm going to miss you, old boy," he said. "You and I've been
places and done things. Good luck to you!" and he gave the rough
trunk a final slap as he turned and walked away into the unknown
upon his hopeless quest.</p>

<p>As his eyes scanned the broad, horizonless vista that melted
into a soft vignette at the uttermost range of human eye-sight it
was difficult to reconcile the complete primitiveness of this
untouched world with his knowledge that a bare five-hundred miles
beneath his feet might be a city teeming with the traffic and the
concerns of countless humans like himself who went their various
ways and lived their lives confronted by no greater menace than a
reckless driver or a banana peel thrown carelessly upon the
pavement.</p>

<p>It amused him to speculate upon what his friends might say
could they see him now, the trim, sophisticated Lieutenant
Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und von Horst naked but for
a loin-cloth, a man of the Pleistocene if ever there was one. And
then his thoughts turned back to Pellucidar and La-ja. He
wondered why she disliked him so, and he winced at the insistent
realization this reverie conjured. He had sought to deny it and
beat it down below the threshold of his consciousness, but it
persisted with the insistent determination of a stricken
conscience. <i>He loved her</i>; he loved this little barbarian
who was as unconscious of the existence of an alphabet as of
finger-bowls.</p>

<p>He plodded on sunk deep in reverie, which is no way to plod
Pellucidar where one must be either very quick or very dead. He
did not hear the thing that walked behind him, for it walked on
padded feet&mdash;he was thinking of La-ja of Lo-har. Then,
suddenly, he was startled into consciousness of his surroundings
and the need for constant vigilance; but too late. Something
seized him around the waist and swept him off his feet. As he was
lifted high in air he squirmed and looked down into the rough and
hairy face of Old White; then he was lowered gently to the broad
neck. He almost laughed aloud in his relief. Instantly he felt
new hope for the future&mdash;that will companionship do, even
the companionship of a dumb beast.</p>

<p>"You old son-of-a-gun!" he exclaimed. "You nearly scared the
breech-cloth off me, but I am glad to see you! Guess you get
lonesome, too, eh? Neither of us seems to have many friends.
Well, we'll stick together as long as you'll stick."</p>

<p>Through dangers that must otherwise have seemed fatal Old
White bore the man-thing for whom he had conceived this strange
attachment. Even the mighty tarag slunk aside out of the path of
the mammoth; no bull of the great herds through which they passed
charged. Once a thipdar circled about them, the great Pteranodon
of the Lias which could carry off a full grown bull Bos. Beneath
the shadow of its twenty foot wing spread they moved, the mammoth
unconcerned, the man apprehensive; but it did not dive to the
attack.</p>

<p>They stopped at intervals to feed and water and to sleep; but
as time meant nothing in this timeless world, von Horst made no
effort to compute it. He only knew that they must be a long way
from Ja-ru. Often he walked to rest his muscles, and Old White
plodded so close to him that his hairy trunk usually touched the
naked body of the man.</p>

<p>To occupy his mind, von Horst had taught the beast several
things&mdash;to raise him to its head upon command and to lower
him to the ground, to kneel and to lie down, to walk or trot or
charge at the proper signal, to lift and carry objects, to place
his head against a tree and push it down, or to encircle one with
its trunk and uproot it.</p>

<p>Old White seemed to enjoy learning and to be proud of his
accomplishments. That he was highly intelligent, von Horst had
long realized; and there was one characteristic of the mighty
beast that proved it to the man beyond doubt. That was Old
White's sense of humor. It was so well developed that there could
be no mistaking it, and there were occasions when von Horst could
have sworn that the mammoth grinned in appreciation of his own
jokes, one of which was to seize the man by an ankle from behind
and swing him into the air; but he never dropped him nor ever
hurt him, always lowering him to the ground gently. Again, if he
thought von Horst had slept too long, he would place a foot upon
his body and pretend to trample him, holding him down; or he
would fill his trunk with water and shower him. The man never
knew what to expect nor when to expect it, but he soon learned
that Old White would never harm him.</p>

<p>Von Horst had no idea how far they had traveled; but he knew
it must have been a considerable distance, yet they had passed no
village nor seen a human being. He marveled at the vast expanse
of uninhabited country given over entirely to wild animals. Thus
had been the outer crust at one time. Yet, as he thought of
conditions there now, it seemed incredible.</p>

<p>Whether he was nearer to Lo-har than before he could not
guess. Often the excursion seemed hare-brained and hopeless. But
what else was there for him to do? He might as well keep moving
whether in the right direction or the wrong. Had he had a human
companion&mdash;had La-ja been with him&mdash;he might have been
reconciled to settle permanently in one of the many beautiful
valleys he had crossed; but to live always alone in one place was
unthinkable. And so he pushed on, exploring a new world that no
one might ever know about but himself.</p>

<p>Each new rise of ground that he approached aroused his
enthusiasm for the unknown. What lay beyond the summit?</p>

<p>What new scenes would be revealed? Thus once, as Old White
moved ponderously up a slight acclivity, the mans mind
conjectured what might lie beyond the summit they were
approaching, his anticipation of new scenes and his enthusiasm
seemingly undiminished; then he heard a deep bellow, followed by
others. Mingled with them seemed to be the voices of men.</p>

<p>To von Horst men meant enemies, so definitely had he
habituated himself to the reactions of the stone age; but he
determined to have a look at these people. Perhaps they were Lo-
harians. Perhaps he had reached Lo-har! The sounds suggested men
driving a herd of cattle in which were many bulls, for the deep
tones of the bellows gave color to his belief that there were
mostly bulls beyond the ridge.</p>

<p>Slipping from Old White's back, von Horst ordered the great
beast to remain where it was; then he crept stealthily forward,
hoping to reach the summit of the ridge unobserved. In this he
was successful, and a moment later he was looking down upon a
scene that might well have made him question the credibility of
his eyesight.</p>

<p>He lay upon the edge of a low cliff, and below him were four
creatures such as might have materialized only from a bad dream.
They had the bodies of men&mdash;squat, stocky men. Their faces,
their shoulders, and their breasts were covered with long, brown
hair. From opposite sides of their foreheads protruded short,
heavy horns much like the horns of a bison; and they had tails
with a bushy tuft of hair at the end. From their throats issued
the bull-like bellows he had heard, as well as the speech of
men.</p>

<p>They carried no weapons; and it was evident that they were
being held at bay by some creature or creatures that were hidden
from the sight of von Horst by the overhanging of the cliff upon
which he lay, for every time they started to approach closer to
the cliff fragments of stone would fly out and drive them back.
This always set them to bellowing angrily; and sometimes one or
another of them would stamp the ground or paw up the dust with a
foot, for all the world like a mad bull; so that von Horst
thought of them then and always as the bison-men.</p>

<p>From the fact that missiles were being hurled at these
creatures by their prey, von Horst assumed that the latter might
be human beings; though, of course, in Pellucidar they might be
any strange variety of man or beast. That they were bison-men, he
doubted; as he noticed that none of the four threw rocks in
return, as he was reasonably certain they would have done had
they been sufficiently intelligent.</p>

<p>Occasionally he caught a word or two as the four spoke to one
another, and he discovered that they spoke the common language of
the human beings of Pellucidar. Presently one of them raised his
voice and shouted to whatever it was they had brought to bay at
the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Stop throwing rocks, gilak," he said. "It will only go worse
with you when we get you, and we shall get you&mdash;be sure of
that. You have neither food nor water; so you must come out or
starve."</p>

<p>"What do you want of us?" demanded a voice from the bottom of
the cliff.</p>

<p>"We want the woman," replied the bison-man who had previously
spoken.</p>

<p>"You don't want me?" demanded the voice.</p>

<p>"Only to kill you; but if you give us the woman, we will spare
you."</p>

<p>"How do I know you'll keep your word?"</p>

<p>"We do not lie," replied the bison-man. "Bring her here and we
will let you go."</p>

<p>"I bring her," announced the voice from below.</p>

<p>"The son of a pig!" ejaculated von Horst beneath his
breath.</p>

<p>A moment later he saw a man emerge from below the overhang of
the cliff, dragging a woman by the hair. Instantly he was upon
his feet, charged with horror and with rage; for at the first
glance he had recognized them&mdash;Skruf and La-ja.</p>

<p>A sheer drop of thirty or forty feet to the ground below left
him temporarily helpless, and for a moment he could only stand
and look down upon the tragedy; then he fitted an arrow to his
bow, but Skruf was partially shielded by the body of the girl.
Von Horst could not shoot without endangering her.</p>

<p>"La-ja!" he cried. The girl tried to turn her head back in the
direction of his voice. Skruf and the bison-men looked up at the
figure standing upon the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>"One side, La-ja!" he called. "Go to one side!" Instantly she
swung to the right, turning Skruf sideways so that he was fully
exposed to the archer whose bow was already drawn. The bow-string
twanged. Skruf screamed and went down clutching at the feathered
shaft sunk deep in his body, and as he fell he released his hold
upon La-ja's hair.</p>

<p>"Run!" commanded von Horst. "Run parallel to the cliff and I
will follow until I find a way down."</p>

<p>Already, recovered from their first surprise, the bison-men
were running toward the girl; but she had a little start, and
with luck she might outdistance them. Their heavy, squat figures
did not seem designed for speed.</p>

<p>Von Horst turned and called to Old White to follow; then he
ran along the cliff-top a little behind La-ja. Almost at once he
realized that the appearance of the bison-men belied their
agility&mdash;they were overhauling the girl. Again he fitted an
arrow to his bow. Just for an instant he paused&mdash;long enough
to take aim at the leading bison-man and release the shaft; then
he sprang forward, but he had lost ground that he could not
regain. However, he had temporarily widened the gap between La-ja
and her pursuers; for the leading bison-man lay groveling on the
ground, an arrow through his back.</p>

<p>The others were closing up, and again von Horst was forced to
stop and shoot. As before, the girl's closest pursuer pitched to
the ground. The fellow rolled over and over, but when he stopped
he lay very still. Now there were only two, but again von Horst
had lost distance. He tried to gain on them but he could not. At
last he halted and sent two more arrows after the remaining
bison-men. The nearer fell, but he missed the other. Twice after
that he loosed his shafts; but the last one fell short, and he
knew that the man was out of range&mdash;out of range and rapidly
gaining on his quarry. Just ahead of the fleeing girl loomed a
forest of giant trees. If she could reach these she might elude
her pursuer, and she was fleet of foot.</p>

<p>In silence the three raced on, von Horst on the cliff-top
barely maintaining his ground; then the girl disappeared among
the boles of the great trees; and a moment later the bison-man
followed her. Von Horst was frantic. The interminable cliff
offered no avenue of descent. There was nothing to do but
continue on until he found such a place, but in the meantime what
would become of La-ja?</p>

<p>To have found her so unexpectedly, to have been so close to
her, and then to have lost her left him heart-sick and hopeless.
Still, he knew now that she lived; and that was something. And
now, close behind him, he heard the familiar trumpeting of Old
White; and a moment later a hairy trunk encircled him and swung
him to the now familiar seat in the hollow back of the massive
skull.</p>

<p>Just beyond the edge of the forest they came upon a rift in
the escarpment; and here the mammoth, finding precarious foot-
hold, picked his way carefully down. Von Horst turned him back to
the point at which La-ja had disappeared; but here he was forced
to dismount, as the trees grew too closely to permit the great
beast to enter the forest, and he could neither uproot nor push
over the giant boles.</p>

<p>As von Horst left Old White to enter the forest he had a
premonition that this was the last time that he would ever see
his faithful friend and ally; and it was with a heavy heart that
he passed into the grim, forbidding wood.</p>

<p>Only for an instant was his mind occupied with thoughts of Old
White, for at a distance he heard a faint scream; and then a
voice called his name twice&mdash;"Von! Von!"&mdash;the voice of
the woman he loved.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19">XIX. &mdash; KRU</a></h2>

<p class="first">Guided only by the memory of that faint cry in
the distance, von Horst pushed on into the forest. Never had he
seen trees of such size growing in such close proximity, often so
near to one another that there was just room for him to pass
between. There was no trail, and because of the zig-zag course he
was forced to pursue he soon lost all sense of direction. Twice
he had called La-ja's name aloud, hoping that she would reply and
thus give him a new clue to her whereabouts, but there had been
no answer. He realized that about all he had accomplished had
been to apprize her captor that he was being pursued and thus put
him on his guard; so, though he moved as rapidly as he could, he
was most watchful. As he hurried on he became more and more
imbued with a sense of frustration and the futility of his
search, feeling that he was quite probably moving in circles and
getting nowhere. He was even impressed by the probability that he
might never even find his way out of this labyrinthine maze of
gloomy trees, to say nothing of reaching La-ja in time to be of
any service to her. And thus his mind was occupied by gloomy
thoughts when he came suddenly to the end of the forest. Before
him lay the mouth of a canyon leading into low but rugged hills,
and here at last was a trail. It wound, well marked, into the
canyon.</p>

<p>With renewed hope von Horst stepped confidently out to follow
wherever the way might lead; for a brief examination told his now
practiced eyes that someone had recently entered the canyon at
this point, and faintly in the dust of the trail he saw the
imprint of a tiny foot. The canyon was little more than a narrow,
rocky gorge winding snake-like into the hills; and as he
proceeded he passed the mouths of other similar gorges that
entered it at intervals; but the main trail was plain, and he
continued upon it, certain now that he must soon overtake La-ja
and her captor.</p>

<p>He had been for some little time in the gorge and was becoming
impatient with each fresh disappointment when he rounded a bend
and did not see those he sought ahead of him, when he heard a
noise behind. He turned quickly and saw a bison-man creeping
stealthily upon him. The instant that the fellow realized he had
been discovered he voiced a bellow that might have issued from
the throat of an angry bull. It was answered from down the gorge
and from up, and then others came rapidly into view both in front
and behind.</p>

<p>Von Horst was trapped. Upon either side the walls of the
canyon, while not high, were unscalable; and behind him were
bison-men cutting off retreat, and in front were bison-men
effectually blocking his advance. Now they were all bellowing.
The rocky walls of the gorge reverberated the angry, bestial
chorus of challenge and of menace. They had been waiting for him.
Von Horst knew it now. They had heard him call to La-ja. They had
known he was following, and they had waited in the concealment of
one of the gorges he had passed. How easily they had trapped him.
But what might he have done to prevent it? How else might he
search for La-ja without following where she went?</p>

<p>What was he to do now? The bison-men were coming toward him
very slowly. They seemed to hold him in great respect. He
wondered if the abductor of La-ja had had either the time or
opportunity to tell his fellows of the havoc this strange gilak
had played with the four that had first met him. That was one of
the tantalizing characteristics of the inner world&mdash;that one
might never know the measure of elapsed time, which might easily
gauge the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here in our country?" demanded the nearest
of the bison-men.</p>

<p>"I have come for the woman," replied von Horst. "She is mine.
Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Who are you? We never saw a gilak like you before, or one who
could send death from a long way off on little sticks."</p>

<p>"Get me the woman," demanded von Horst, "or I'll send death to
you all." He withdrew an arrow from his quiver and fitted it to
his bow.</p>

<p>"You cannot kill us all," said the creature. "You have not as
many sticks as there are Ganaks."</p>

<p>"What are Ganaks?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"We are Ganaks. We will take you to Drovan. If he says not to
kill you, we will not kill you."</p>

<p>"Is the woman there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I will go. Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Follow the Ganaks in front of you up the gorge." They all
moved on then in the direction that von Horst had been going, and
presently they came to a large, open valley in which there were
many trees dotted picturesquely over gently rolling ground. Out
upon the plain a short distance lay what appeared to be a
circular, palisaded village; and toward this the bison-men led
the way.</p>

<p>As he came nearer, von Horst saw that there were fields of
growing crops outside the village and that in these fields men
and women were working&mdash;human beings like himself, not
Ganaks; but there were many Ganak bulls loitering around. These
performed no labor.</p>

<p>A single small gateway led into the village which consisted of
a complete circle of mud huts, one adjoining the other except in
this one spot where the gateway lay. Trees grew all around the
circle in front of the huts, spreading shade trees. In the center
of the large compound was a cluster of huts; and here too there
were shade trees.</p>

<p>To these central huts his guides led von Horst, and here he
saw a large bison-man standing in the shade switching the flies
from his legs with his tufted tail. Facing him stood La-ja with
her captor, and half surrounding them was a curious throng of
Ganaks.</p>

<p>As the new party approached, the big bull looked in their
direction. He had massive horns, and the hair upon his face and
shoulders and chest was heavy. His small, round eyes, set wide
apart, were red-rimmed and fierce as they glowered menacingly at
von Horst. His head was lowered, much after the manner of a
beast's.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he demanded, indicating von Horst.</p>

<p>"This is the gilak that killed the three who were with me,"
said La-ja's captor.</p>

<p>"Tell me again how he killed them," directed the big bull.</p>

<p>"He sent little sticks to kill them," said the other.</p>

<p>"Little sticks do not kill, Trun. You are a fool or a
liar."</p>

<p>"Little sticks did kill the three that were with me and
another that was there, a gilak. I saw them kill, Drovan. See
them? They are in that thing upon his back."</p>

<p>"Fetch a slave," commanded Drovan, "an old one that is not
much good."</p>

<p>Von Horst stood there gazing at La-ja. He scarcely saw or
heard what was going on about him. La-ja was looking at him. Her
face was almost expressionless.</p>

<p>"So you are not dead yet," she said.</p>

<p>"I heard you call me, La-ja," he said "I came as soon as I
could."</p>

<p>She raised her chin. "I did not call you," she said
haughtily.</p>

<p>Von Horst was dumbfounded. He had heard her call, plainly,
twice. Suddenly he became angry. His face flushed. "You are a
little fool," he said. "You are absolutely without appreciation
or gratitude. You are not worth saving." Then he turned his back
on her.</p>

<p>Instantly he regretted his words; but he was hurt&mdash;hurt
as he never had been in his life before. And he was too proud to
retract what he had said.</p>

<p>A bison-man approached bringing an old slave woman with him.
He led her to Drovan. The chief gave her a rough push.</p>

<p>"Go over there and stand," he ordered.</p>

<p>The old woman moved slowly away&mdash;a bent and helpless old
creature.</p>

<p>"That's far enough," shouted Drovan. "Stand there where you
are."</p>

<p>"You!" he bellowed, pointing at von Horst. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>The man eyed the half-beast insolently. He was mad all the way
through&mdash;mad at himself and the world. "When you speak to
me, don't bellow," he said.</p>

<p>Drovan lashed his legs angrily with his tail and lowered his
head like a mad bull about to charge. He took a few slow steps
toward von Horst; and then he stopped and pawed the ground with
one foot and bellowed, but the man did not retreat, nor did he
show fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chief espied the old slave woman standing out in
the compound as he had directed her; then he turned again to von
Horst. He pointed at the old woman.</p>

<p>"If your sticks will kill," he said, "kill her. But I do not
believe that they will kill."</p>

<p>"My sticks will kill," said von Horst. "The Ganaks will see
that they will kill."</p>

<p>He took a few steps out into the compound toward the old slave
woman and fitted an arrow to his bow; then he turned toward
Drovan and pointed at La-ja.</p>

<p>"Will you set that girl and myself free if I show you that my
little sticks will kill?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No," growled the chief.</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged. "Let it be on your own shoulders," he
said; and with that he drew back the feathered shaft, and before
anyone could guess his intention or interfere he drove it through
Drovan's heart.</p>

<p>Instantly the compound was a riot of bellowing bulls. They
fell upon von Horst before he could fit another arrow to his bow
and by weight of numbers bore him to the ground, striking him
with their fists and trying to gore him with their horns; but
there were so many of them that they interfered with one
another.</p>

<p>The man was pretty nearly done for when the attention of his
attackers was attracted by a voice of authority.</p>

<p>"Do not kill," it commanded. "Let him up. It is I, Kru the
Chief, who speaks."</p>

<p>Instantly the bulls abandoned von Horst and turned on the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Who says Kru is chief?" demanded one. "It is I, Tant, who
will be chief now that Drovan is dead."</p>

<p>During the argument von Horst had dragged himself to his feet.
He was half stunned for a moment, but he soon gathered his wits.
Quickly he hunted for his bow and found it. Some of the arrows
that had dropped from his quiver during the melee he found and
retrieved.</p>

<p>Now his mind was alert. He looked about him. All the bulls
were watching the two claimants for the chieftainship, but some
of them were ranging themselves closer to Kru than to Tant. A few
went hesitantly to Tant's side. It looked like Kru to von Horst.
He stepped over near those who were assembling around Kru.</p>

<p>Surreptitiously he fitted an arrow to his bow. He knew that he
was taking a wild chance; and his better judgment told him to
mind his own business, but he was still angry and indifferent as
to whether he lived or not. Suddenly he straightened up. "Kru is
chief!" he cried. Simultaneously he drove an arrow into Tant's
chest. "Are there any others who will not accept Kru as chief?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>Some of them who had gathered around Tant ran to strike him
down; they charged with lowered horns like bulls. But those about
Kru charged to meet them; and as they fought, von Horst moved
backward slowly until he stood with his back against the chiefs
hut. Close to him stood La-ja. He paid no attention to her,
although it was plain to her that he was aware of her
presence.</p>

<p>The man was engrossed in the strange tactics of these half-
beasts. When they did not clinch they dove with lowered heads for
the belly of an antagonist, seeking to disembowel him with their
heavy horns. Oftentimes they met head on with such terrific force
that both were knocked down. When they clinched, each antagonist
seized another by the shoulders; and, straining and tugging, they
sought to gore each other in the face or neck or chest.</p>

<p>It was a scene of savage fury made more terrifying by the
bellowing and snorting of the combatants; but it was soon over,
for those who opposed Kru were few in numbers and without a
leader. One by one, those who survived broke away and retreated,
leaving the field to Kru.</p>

<p>The new chief, overcome by his importance, strutted about
pompously. He sent immediately for the women of Drovan and Tant,
of which there were about thirty; and after selecting half of
them for himself turned the others over to his followers to be
divided by lot.</p>

<p>In the meantime von Horst and La-ja remained in the background
practically unnoticed by the bison-men, nor did they call
attention to themselves, as it was obvious that the bulls were
worked up to a frenzy of hysterical excitement by all that had so
recently transpired and by the sight and smell of blood.
Presently, however, the eyes of an old bull fell upon them; and
he commenced to bellow deep in his chest and paw the ground. He
approached them, lowering his head as though about to charge. Von
Horst fitted an arrow to his bow. The bull hesitated; then he
turned toward Kru.</p>

<p>"The gilaks," he said. "When do we kill the gilaks or set them
to work?"</p>

<p>Kru looked in the direction of the speaker. Von Horst waited
for the chiefs answer. It had been upon the hope of his gratitude
that he had based his hopes for liberty for himself and La-ja,
for he was still thinking of the girl's welfare. He found that he
could not do otherwise, no matter how ungrateful she might be. He
wondered how much gratitude, then, he might expect from this
brutal bison-man if La-ja accorded him none.</p>

<p>"Well," said the old bull, "do we kill the gilaks or do we put
them to work in the fields?"</p>

<p>"Kill the she!" cried one of the women.</p>

<p>"No," growled Kru, "the she shall not be killed. Take them
away and put them in a hut and guard them. Later Kru will decide
what to do with the man."</p>

<p>Von Horst and La-ja were taken to a filthy hut. They were not
bound. The man's weapons were not taken away from him, and he
could only assume that their captors were too stupid and
unimaginative to sense the necessity for such precautions. La-ja
went to one side of the hut and sat down, von Horst to the other.
They did not speak. The man did not even look at the woman, but
her eyes were often upon him.</p>

<p>He was unhappy and almost without hope. If she had been kind
to him, even civil, he might have envisioned a future worth
fighting for with enthusiasm; but now, without hope of her love,
there seemed nothing. The knowledge that he loved her aroused in
him only self-contempt, while it should have been a source of
pride. He felt only a dull sense of duty to her because she was a
woman. He knew that he would try to save her. He knew that he
would fight for her, but he felt no elation.</p>

<p>Presently he lay down and slept. He dreamed that he slept in a
clean bed between cool sheets, and that when he awoke he put on
fresh linen and well pressed clothes and went down to a sumptuous
dinner at a perfectly appointed table. A waiter, bringing a
salver of food, bumped against his shoulder.</p>

<p>He awoke to see a woman standing beside him. She had kicked
his shoulder. "Wake up," she said. "Here is your fodder."</p>

<p>She dumped an armful of fresh-cut grass and some vegetables on
the filthy floor beside him. "It is for the woman, too," she
said.</p>

<p>Von Horst sat up and looked at the woman. She was not a Ganak,
but a human being like himself. "What is the grass for?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"To eat," she replied.</p>

<p>"We do not eat grass," he said, "and there are not enough
vegetables here to make a meal for one."</p>

<p>"You will eat grass here or you will starve," said the woman.
"We slaves are not allowed many vegetables."</p>

<p>"How about meat?" inquired von Horst.</p>

<p>"The Ganaks do not eat meat; so there is no meat to eat. I
have been here for more sleeps than I can remember, and I have
never seen anyone eat meat. You'll get used to the grass after
awhile."</p>

<p>"Do they put all their prisoners to work in the fields?" asked
von Horst.</p>

<p>"You never can tell what they will do. As a rule they keep the
women and work them in the fields until they get too old; then
they kill them. If they are short of slaves they keep the men for
awhile; otherwise they kill them immediately. They have kept me
for many sleeps. I belong to Splay. They will give this woman to
someone, because she is young. They will probably kill you, as
they have plenty of slaves now&mdash;more than they care to
feed."</p>

<p>When the woman had gone, von Horst gathered up the vegetables
and placed them beside La-ja. The girl looked up at him. Her eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>"Why do you do such things?" she demanded. "I do not want you
to do anything for me. I do not want to like you."</p>

<p>Von Horst shrugged. "You are succeeding very well," he said,
dryly.</p>

<p>She mumbled something that he could not catch and commenced to
divide the vegetables into two parts. "You eat your share and I
shall eat mine," she said.</p>

<p>"There are not enough for one, let alone two. You'd better
keep them all," he insisted. "Anyway, I don't care much for raw
vegetables."</p>

<p>"Then you can leave them. I'll not eat them. If you don't like
the vegetables, eat the grass."</p>

<p>Von Horst relapsed into silence and commenced to gnaw on a
tuber. It was better than nothing&mdash;that was about all he
could say for it. As the girl ate she occasionally glanced at the
man furtively. Once he glanced up and caught her eyes on him, and
she looked away quickly.</p>

<p>"Why do you dislike me, La-ja?" he asked. "What have I
done."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to talk about it. I don't wish to talk to you at
all."</p>

<p>"You're not fair," he remonstrated. "If I knew what I'd done,
I might correct it. It would be much pleasanter if we were
friends, for we may have to see a lot of each other before we get
to Lo-har."</p>

<p>"We'll never get to Lo-har."</p>

<p>"Don't give up hope. These people are stupid. We ought to be
able to out-wit them and escape."</p>

<p>"We won't; but if we did you wouldn't be going to Lo-har."</p>

<p>"I'm going wherever you go," he replied doggedly.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go to Lo-har? You'd only be killed. Gaz
would break you in two. But why do you want to go at all?"</p>

<p>"Because you are going," he said. He spoke scarcely above a
whisper, as though to himself.</p>

<p>She looked at him intently, questioningly. Her expression
underwent a barely perceptible change, which he did not note
because he was not looking at her. It seemed a little less
uncompromising. There was the difference between granite and
ice&mdash;ice is very cold and hard, but it does thaw.</p>

<p>"If you would only tell me what I have done," he
insisted&mdash;"why you do not like me."</p>

<p>"That, I could not say to you," she replied. "If you were not
a fool, you'd know."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I'm sorry," he said, "but I guess I am; so
please tell me because I am such a fool."</p>

<p>"No," she replied emphatically.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you give me a clue?&mdash;just a little hint?"</p>

<p>She thought for a moment. "Perhaps I could do that," she said.
"You remember that you struck me and carried me away from Basti
by force?"</p>

<p>"I did it for your own good, and I apologized," he reminded
her.</p>

<p>"But you did it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you didn't do anything about it," she insisted.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said hopelessly.</p>

<p>"If I believed that, I might forgive you; but I don't believe
anyone can be such a fool."</p>

<p>He sought to find some explanation of the riddle; but though
he racked his brains, he could think of none. What <i>could</i>
he have done about it?</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said La-ja presently, "neither one of us
understands the other. Tell me just exactly why you insist on
going to Lo-har with me; and if your reason is what I am
beginning to suspect it is, I'll tell you why I have not liked
you."</p>

<p>"That's a bet," exclaimed the man. "I want to go to Lo-har
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two bison-men burst into the hut, cutting him short. "Come!"
they commanded. "Now Kru is going to have you killed."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE BELLOWING
HERD</a></h2>

<p class="first">The two Ganaks motioned La-ja to accompany them.
"Kru has sent for you, too," they said; "but he is not going to
kill you," they added, grinning. As they passed through the
village toward the hut of the chief, many of the Ganaks were
lying in the shade of the numerous trees that grew within the
compound. Some were eating the grass that had been cut by the
slaves; others were placidly chewing their cuds, drowsing with
half-closed eyes. Some of the children played. Sporadically and
briefly, but the adults neither played nor laughed nor conversed.
They were typical ruminants, seemingly as stupid. They wore
neither ornaments nor clothing, nor had they any weapons.</p>

<p>To their lack of weapons, coupled with their stupidity, von
Horst attributed the fact that they had not relieved him of his.
He still had his bow and arrows and a knife, though he had not
recovered his spear which he had dropped during the fight
following his slaying of Drovan.</p>

<p>The prisoners were led before Kru who lay in the shade of the
great tree that overspread his hut, the hut that had been
Drovan's so recently. He looked at them through his red-rimmed
eyes, but mostly he looked at La-ja. "You belong to me," he said
to her; "you belong to the chief. Pretty soon you go in hut; now
you stay outside, watch gilak man die. You will see how you die
if you make Kru mad." Then he turned to a bull lying beside him.
"Splay, go tell the slaves to bring the dancing water and the
death-tree."</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" demanded von Horst. "Why should you kill
me? If it hadn't been for me you wouldn't be chief."</p>

<p>"Too many men slaves," grunted Kru. "They eat too much.
Dancing water good; death-tree fun."</p>

<p>"Fun for whom&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"No, fun for Ganaks; no fun for gilak." Presently Splay
returned with a number of slaves. Several of the men carried a
small tree that had been stripped of its branches; other men and
the women bore quantities of small sticks and rude jars and
gourds filled with a liquid.</p>

<p>At sight of them the bison-men commenced to gather from all
parts of the village; their women came too, but the young were
chased away. They sat down forming a great circle about the tree
before the chiefs hut. A slave passed a jar to one in the circle.
He took a long draught and passed it to the next in line. Thus it
started around the circle. The slaves bearing the other gourds
and jars followed it around just outside the circle. When it had
been emptied another was started at that point.</p>

<p>The men slaves who bore the small tree trunk dug a hole in the
ground in an open space between the chiefs hut and the village
gate. When the hole was sufficiently deep they set the tree
upright in it and stamped dirt around it. It protruded about six
feet above the surface of the ground. And while this was going on
many gourds and jars had been passed around the circle. Now men
and women were bellowing, and presently a woman arose and began
to leap and skip in clumsy, awkward simulation of a dance. Soon
others joined her, both men and women, until all the adults of
the village were leaping and staggering and lurching about the
compound.</p>

<p>"Dancing-water," said von Horst to La-ja, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the water that takes men's brains away. Sometimes
it makes brave men of cowards and beasts of brave men and always
fools of all men. Gaz drinks much of it before he kills."</p>

<p>"That must be the tree of death over there." Von Horst nodded
in the direction of the sapling the slaves had finished setting
up. Now they were piling dry grass and leaves and sticks all
around it.</p>

<p>"The death tree!" whispered La-ja. "What is it for?"</p>

<p>"For me," said the man.</p>

<p>"But how? I do not understand. It can't be that they are going
to&mdash;Oh, no; they can't be."</p>

<p>"But they are, La-ja. Odd, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What is odd?"</p>

<p>"That these creatures that are so near the beasts couldn't
think of such a thing by themselves nor accomplish it. That only
man of all the animals has the faculty of devising torture for
amusement."</p>

<p>"I had never thought of that," she said; "but it is true, and
it is also true that only man makes the drink that steals away
his brains and makes him like the beasts."</p>

<p>"Not like the beasts, La-ja&mdash;only more human; for it
removes his inhibitions and permits him to be himself."</p>

<p>She did not reply, but stood staring at the stake in the
center of the compound, fascinated. Von Horst watched her lovely
profile, wondering what was passing in that half savage little
brain. He knew that the end must be nearing rapidly, but he had
made no move to escape the horrible death the slaves were
preparing for him. If there had been only himself to consider, he
could have made a break for liberty and died fighting; but there
was the girl. He wanted to save her far more than he wanted to
save himself.</p>

<p>All about them the bison-men were dancing and bellowing. He
heard Kru shout, "Fire! Fire! Give us a fire to dance around.
More dance-water! Bring more dance-water, slaves!"</p>

<p>As the slaves refilled the jars and gourds, others built a
large fire near the stake; and the bellowing herd immediately
commenced to circle it. With the lighting of the fire the
demeanor of the bison-men became more uncontrolled, more
boisterous, and more bestial; and with the added stimulus of the
new supply of drink they threw aside all discretion.</p>

<p>To right and left they were falling to the ground&mdash;those
remaining on their feet so drunk that they could scarcely
stagger. Then someone raised the cry, "The gilak! To the death-
tree with him!"</p>

<p>It was taken up on all sides by those who could still speak,
and then Kru came staggering toward von Horst.</p>

<p>"To the death tree with him!" he bellowed. "The girl!" he
exclaimed. It was as though he had forgotten her until his eyes
fell on her on that minute. "Come with me! You are Kru's." He
reached out a dirty paw to seize her.</p>

<p>"Not so fast!" said von Horst, stepping between them; then he
struck Kru in the face, knocking him down, seized La-ja by the
hand and started to run for the village gate, which the slaves
had left open when they brought in the tree and the fire-wood.
Behind them was the whole herd of bison-men, bellowing with rage
as they commenced to get it through their befuddled minds that
the prisoners were making a break for escape. In front of them
were the slaves. Would they try to stop them? Von Horst dropped
La-ja's hand and removed his now useless cartridge belt. Useless?
Not quite. A slave tried to stop him, and he swung the loaded
belt to the side of his head, knocking him down.</p>

<p>That and one look at von Horst's face sent the other slaves
scurrying out of his way, but now some of the bison-men were
taking up the pursuit. However, a single backward glance assured
von Horst that either he or La-ja could out-distance them at the
moment; as they had difficulty in remaining on their feet at all,
while those that did moved about so erratically as to make the
idea of pursuit by them appear ridiculous. Nevertheless, they
were coming, and the gate was a long way off. To von Horst's
disgust, he saw that a few of the bison-men were steadying. But
their vile drink held most of them in a state of helplessness. A
few, however, had rallied and formed a definitely menacing group
as they followed the two fugitives.</p>

<p>"I'll give 'em something to think about besides us," said von
Horst, and as they passed the roaring fire he threw his cartridge
belt into it.</p>

<p>As they neared the gate he spoke again to La-ja. "Run," he
said. "I'll try to hold them for a moment or two;" then he
wheeled and faced the oncoming bison-men. There were only about a
dozen of them sober enough to control their actions or hold to a
fixed purpose. The majority of the others were milling about the
fire or lying helpless on the ground, and even the dozen were
erratic in their movements.</p>

<p>Von Horst loosed an arrow at the nearest of the pursuers. It
caught him in the belly, and he went down shrieking and
bellowing. A second arrow bowled over another. The remainder were
quite close now, too close for comfort. He sent another arrow
into a third; and that stopped them, momentarily at least. Then
the cartridges in the fire began to explode. At the first
detonation those who were pursuing the fugitives turned to see
what had caused this startling sound, and simultaneously von
Horst wheeled and started for the gate.</p>

<p>He found La-ja standing directly behind him, but she too
turned and ran the instant that she saw that he was leaving.</p>

<p>"I thought I told you to run," he said.</p>

<p>"What good would it have done, if you had been recaptured or
killed?" she demanded. "They would only have caught me again. But
it would have done them no good. Kru would not have had me."</p>

<p>He saw then that she carried her stone knife in her hand, and
a lump rose in his throat from pity for her. He wanted to take
her in his arms from sympathy, but when one is running from
imminent death one cannot very well take a woman who hates one
into one's arms.</p>

<p>"But you might have escaped and reached Lo-har," he
protested.</p>

<p>"There are other things in the world beside reaching Lo-har,"
she replied enigmatically.</p>

<p>They were past the gates now. Behind them rose the din of
exploding cartridges and the mad bellowing of the bison-men.
Before them stretched an open, rolling, tree-dotted valley. To
their left was the great forest, to their right a fringe of trees
at the base of low, wooded cliffs.</p>

<p>Von Horst bore to the right.</p>

<p>"The forest is closer," suggested La-ja.</p>

<p>"It is in the wrong direction," he replied. "Lo-har should lie
in the direction we are going. It does, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in this general direction."</p>

<p>"But more important is the fact that if we got into the great
forest we'd lose ourselves in no time&mdash;and no telling where
we'd come out."</p>

<p>La-ja glanced back.</p>

<p>"I think they're gaining on us," she said. "They are very
fast."</p>

<p>Von Horst realized that they'd never reach the cliffs ahead of
their pursuers, that their break for liberty had only delayed the
inevitable.</p>

<p>"I have a few more arrows left," he said. "We can keep on
until they overtake us. Something may happen&mdash;a miracle, and
it will have to be a miracle. If nothing does, we can make a
stand for it. I may be able to kill off enough of them to
frighten the others away while we make a fresh start for the
cliffs."</p>

<p>"Not a chance," said La-ja. "Look back there near the
village."</p>

<p>Von Horst whistled. More warriors were emerging from the
gateway. Evidently Kru was sending all who could stand on their
feet to join in the pursuit.</p>

<p>"It looks like a hard winter," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Winter?" queried La-ja. "I see nothing but Ganaks. Where is
the winter?"</p>

<p>She was panting from exertion, and her words came in little
gasps.</p>

<p>"Well, let it pass. We'd better save our breath for
running."</p>

<p>Thereafter they bent all their energies to the task of out-
distancing the bison-men, but without hope. Constantly they lost
ground; yet they were nearing the cliffs and the little fringe of
wood that half hid them.</p>

<p>Von Horst did not know why he felt so certain that they might
be safe if they reached the cliffs; yet he did feel it, and his
judgment seemed justified by the fact that the bison-men appeared
so anxious to overtake them as quickly as possible. If they had
known that the fugitives could not escape even after reaching the
cliffs, it seemed reasonable to assume that they would have shown
less haste and excitement and would have trailed more slowly and
with far less exertion.</p>

<p>Presently La-ja stumbled and fell. Von Horst wheeled and was
at her side instantly. She seemed very weak as he helped her to
her feet.</p>

<p>"It's no use," she said. "I cannot go on. I have been running
away from Skruf for a long time, always without sufficient food
or rest. It has made me weak. Go on without me. You might easily
save yourself. There is nothing more that you can do for me."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," he said. "We'll make our stand here. We'd have
had to made it pretty soon anyway."</p>

<p>He turned to glance at the oncoming half-beasts. In a moment
they'd be within arrow range. There were nine of them, and he had
six arrows left. If he got six of the pursuers he might bluff off
the other three, but how about the swarm that was now pouring up
the valley from the village?</p>

<p>He was thinking how futile was his foolish little stand
against such odds, when something impelled him to turn suddenly
and look at La-ja. It was one of those strange, psychic phenomena
which most of us have experienced, and which many trained
researchers ridicule; yet the force which caused von Horst to
turn about seemed almost physical, so powerfully did it affect
him and so peremptorily. And as he turned he voiced a cry of
alarm and leaped forward, seizing La-ja's right wrist.</p>

<p>"La-ja!" he cried: "Thank the Lord I saw you." He wrenched her
stone knife from her fingers, and then dropped her hand. He had
broken out into a cold sweat and was trembling.</p>

<p>"How could you? La-ja, how could you?"</p>

<p>"It is best," she said. "If I were dead you might escape. Soon
they will take us; and then we shall both die; for they will kill
you, and I will kill myself. I will not let Kru have me."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that is right; but wait until all hope is
gone."</p>

<p>"It is gone. You have already done too much for me. The least
I can do is to make you free to save yourself. Give me back my
knife." He shook his head.</p>

<p>"But if they get me, and I have no knife, how can I escape
Kru?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you have it," he said, "if you'll promise not to do
that until after I am dead. As long as I live there is hope."</p>

<p>"I promise," she said. "I do not want to die. I just wanted to
save you."</p>

<p>"Because you hate me?" he asked with a half-smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied unsmilingly. "Perhaps I do not want to
be under such obligations to one I don't like&mdash;or perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>He handed the knife back to her. "You have promised me," he
reminded her.</p>

<p>"I shall keep my promise. Look; they are very close."</p>

<p>He turned then and saw that the bison-men were almost within
bow-shot. He fitted an arrow and waited. They saw, and came more
slowly. Now they spread out to afford him a poorer target. He had
not given them credit for that much sense.</p>

<p>"I'll get some of them," he called back to La-ja. "I wish you
would run for the cliffs. I think you could make it. I am sure I
can hold them for a while."</p>

<p>The girl did not reply and he could not take his eyes from the
bison-men long enough even to glance back at her. His bow
twanged. A bison-man screamed and fell.</p>

<p>"I'm getting pretty hot at this archery stuff," he commented
aloud. This evidence of childish pride upon the very threshold of
death amused him, and he smiled. He thought that if he were home
he could give exhibitions at town fairs. Perhaps he could even
learn to shoot backward through a mirror as he had seen rifle
experts do. It was all very amusing. He pictured the
embarrassment of his fellow officers and other friends when they
saw large colored lithographs announcing the coming of
"Lieutenant Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und von Horst,
Champion Archer of the World. Admission 25 pfennings."</p>

<p>He loosed another arrow, still smiling. "I think I shall
charge more admission," he mused as another bison-man dropped.
"I'm pretty good."</p>

<p>La-ja interrupted his amusing train of thought with an
exclamation of despair. "A tandor is coming, Von," she cried. "It
is coming for us. Its tail is up, and it is coming straight for
us. It must be an old bull that has gone mad. They are
terrible."</p>

<p>Von Horst glanced back. Yes, a mammoth was coming; and it was
coming straight as an arrow in their direction. There could be no
doubt but that it had seen them and was trotting up to charge.
When it got closer it would trumpet, its tail and trunk and ears
would all go up; and it would barge down on them like a runaway
locomotive. There would be no escaping it, Bison-men in front, a
mad mammoth in the rear!</p>

<p>"This doesn't seem to be our lucky day," he said.</p>

<p>"Day?" inquired La-ja. "What is day?" The bison-men were
watching the mammoth. Behind them their fellows were approaching
rapidly. Soon there would be fully a hundred of them. Von Horst
wondered if they would stand the charge of a mammoth. They bore
no arms. How could they defend themselves. Then he glanced back
at the mammoth, and his heart leaped. It was quite close now, and
it was about to charge. He could see the patch of white hair on
its left jowl quite plainly. He voiced the call with which the
great beast had been so familiar. Simultaneously the great trunk
went up, a thunderous trumpeting shook the earth, and Old White
charged.</p>

<p>Von Horst swept La-ja into his arms and stood there in the
path of the gigantic monster. Could it be that Old White did not
know him, or had he really gone mad and bent on killing, no
matter whom, just for the sake of killing?</p>

<p>The girl clung to the man. He felt her arms about his neck,
her firm young breasts pressed against his body, and he was
resigned. If it were death, he could not have chosen a happier
end&mdash;in the arms of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>With a squeal of rage, Old White brushed past them so close
that he almost bowled them over and bore down upon the bison-men.
These scattered but they did not run. Then it was that von Horst
saw how they fought the mighty tandor.</p>

<p>Leaping aside, they sprang in again, goring at the great
beast's side and belly as he raced past. They were thrown down by
the impact, but they were on their feet again instantly. As a
group lured Old White in one direction, fifty Ganaks rushed in
upon his sides and rear seeking to reach and tear him with their
stout horns. Perhaps they had overcome other mammoths in this
way, for it was evident that they were but following an
accustomed routine; but Old White was not as other mammoths. When
he had felt a few horns tear his tough sides he ceased charging.
He did not let any of them get behind him again. He moved slowly
toward them, reminding von Horst of a huge cat stalking a bird.
The bison-men waited for the charge, ready to leap aside and then
in to gore him; but he did not charge. He came close and then
made a short, quick rush, seized a bison-man, raised him high
above his head and hurled him with terrific force among his
fellows, downing a dozen of them. Before they could collect
themselves, Old White was among them, trampling and tossing,
until those who managed to elude him were glad to run for their
village as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>The mammoth pursued them for a short distance picking up a few
stragglers and hurling them far ahead among the frightened,
bellowing herd; then he turned about and came at his slow,
swinging pace toward von Horst and the girl.</p>

<p>"Now he will kill us!" she cried. "Why didn't we run away
while we had the chance?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21">XXI. &mdash; DESERTED</a></h2>

<p class="first">"He won't hurt us," von Horst assured her.</p>

<p>"How do you know he won't?" she demanded. "You saw what he did
to the Ganaks."</p>

<p>"We are friends, Old White and I."</p>

<p>"This is no time to laugh with words," she said. "It is very
brave but it isn't good sense."</p>

<p>The mammoth was nearing them. La-ja involuntarily pressed
close to von Horst. He threw a protective arm about her and held
her still closer. He was aware that her attitude seemingly belied
her repeated assurances of dislike and wondered if fear could so
quickly overcome her pride. That did not seem at all like La-ja.
He was puzzled, but he was not too insistent upon questioning any
circumstance that brought her into his arms. The fact was enough.
All that he could do was acknowledge another debt of gratitude to
Old White.</p>

<p>The mammoth stopped in front of them. He seemed to be
questioning the presence of the girl. Von Horst's only fear was
that the great, savage beast might not accept her. He had known
but one human friend. All others had been enemies to be killed.
The man spoke to him and stroked the trunk that was reaching
tentatively toward the girl. Then he gave the command to lift
them to his back. There was a moment's hesitation as the
sensitive tip moved slowly over La-ja. The girl did not shrink.
For that von Horst was thankful. How very brave she was! The
trunk encircled them, and again the girl's arms went around the
man's neck. Old White tightened his grip. Von Horst repeated the
command to lift them, and they were swung from the ground and
deposited just behind the great head. At the man's signal, the
mammoth moved off in the direction of Lo-har.</p>

<p>La-ja breathed a little sigh that was half gasp. "I do not
understand," she said. "How can you make a wild tandor do what
you tell him to do?"</p>

<p>Von Horst told her then of his first encounter with Old White
and of all that had occurred since&mdash;his captivity among the
mammoth-men, of the little canyon, and of his eventual
escape.</p>

<p>"I saw you attack Frug," she said; "and then Skruf dragged me
across the river, and I never knew whether you were killed by
Frug or by the mammoth-men, or if they captured you.</p>

<p>"Skruf hid with me in a cave beside the river. He put a gag in
my mouth so that I couldn't cry out and attract the attention of
the mammoth-men. We heard them hunting us. I would rather have
been captured by them than taken back to Basti, and Skruf knew
it. I thought you might be a prisoner among them, too."</p>

<p>She caught herself quickly, as though she had spoken without
thought. "Of course I didn't care. It was only that the country
of the mammoth-men is much nearer Lo-har than Basti is. I did not
want to be taken all the way back to Basti.</p>

<p>"We hid for a long time; then we started out again, but at the
first sleep I escaped. The thongs he tied me with were so loose
that I slipped my hands from them.</p>

<p>"I ran away toward Lo-har. I went a long way and thought that
I was safe. I slept many times; so I know I must have come far. I
was very lucky. I met only a few of the flesh-eaters and these
always when there was a place to hide&mdash;a tree or a cave with
a very small entrance. I saw no man until once I looked behind me
from the top of a low hill and saw Skruf following me. He was a
long way off, but I knew him at once. He saw me. It was very
plain that he saw me, for he stopped suddenly and stood still for
a moment; then he started after me at a trot. I turned and ran. I
tried every way that I knew to throw him off my track, and after
a long time I thought that I had succeeded. But I had not. He
came upon me while I was sleeping, and started to drag me back to
Basti. It was then that the bison-men discovered us. You know the
rest."</p>

<p>"You have had a hard time of it, La-ja," said von Horst. "I
can't understand how you have come through alive."</p>

<p>"I think I have had a very easy time of it," she replied.
"Very few girls who are stolen from the tribe ever escape their
captors. Many of them are killed; the others have to mate with
men they do not like. That I would not do. I would kill myself
first. I think I am a very lucky girl."</p>

<p>"But think of all the dangers and hardships you have had to
face," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she admitted, "it is not easy to be alone always
with enemies. It is not pleasant, but I have not had so many
dangers. The Gorbuses were the worst. I did not like them."</p>

<p>Von Horst was amazed. It seemed incredible that a girl could
pass through what she had without being a nervous wreck, yet La-
ja appeared to take it all as a matter of course. It was
difficult for him not to compare her with girls of his own world
and forget how different her environment had been. Where they
walked with assurance, she might be as terrified as would they in
Pellucidar&mdash;though it was not easy to visualize La-ja as
terrified under any circumstances.</p>

<p>It often pleased him to dream of taking her back to the outer
world with him. There were so many things, commonplace to him,
that would astonish her&mdash;her first ride on a train, in an
automobile, in an airplane; the sight of the great buildings, the
giant liners, huge cities. He tried to imagine what the reaction
would be of one who had never seen any of these things, nor
dreamed of their existence, nor of the civilization that had
produced them.</p>

<p>She would find many things foolish and impractical&mdash;the
wearing of high-heeled shoes that pinched her feet; she would
think it foolish to wear furs when it was not cold, to dress
warmly in the daytime and go half naked at night. All clothes
would hamper her; she would not like them. But with the beauty of
her face and figure, her pride, and her femininity she would soon
learn to like them, of that he was quite certain.</p>

<p>Poor little La-ja! What a crime it would be to let
civilization spoil her. However, that was nothing for him to
worry about. She would not have him even in Pellucidar, nor was
there much likelihood that he would ever himself see the outer
world again, much less take her or anyone else back with him.</p>

<p>With reveries such as these and desultory conversation with
La-ja he whiled the time while Old White bore them in the
direction of Lo-har. Even the larger beasts of prey they
encountered on the way turned aside from the path of the great
bull mammoth, so that their journey was one of ease, free from
the constant menace of these fierce flesh-eaters which would have
constantly harassed them had they been on foot.</p>

<p>They had slept three times and eaten not a few when La-ja
announced that they were approaching Lo-har. They had halted to
rest and sleep&mdash;it would be the last sleep before they
reached Lo-har, and La-ja seemed preoccupied and dejected. During
this last journey together she had been friendly and
companionable, so that von Horst's hopes had risen; though he had
had to admit to himself that she still gave him no reason to
believe that she did more than tolerate him. However, he had been
very happy&mdash;happier than he had been since he had entered
this strange world; perhaps happier than he had ever been, for he
had never been in love before.</p>

<p>They had made camp and he had gone out on the plain and
brought down a small antelope with an arrow from his bow. Now
they were grilling cuts over a small fire. Old White had moved
ponderously to a clump of young trees which he was rapidly
denuding of foliage. The noon-day sun beat down upon the open
plain beside which they were camped and upon which great herds
grazed peacefully, for the moment undisturbed by any prowling
carnivore.</p>

<p>Von Horst felt the peace and contentment that hung over the
scene like a white cloud above a summer sea, and his mood was in
harmony with his environment. His eyes rested upon La-ja,
devouring her; and almost upon his lips was an avowal of the
passion that filled his whole being.</p>

<p>She chanced to turn and catch his eyes upon her; for a moment
they held; then she looked off across the plain. She pointed.</p>

<p>"When we set out again," she said, "I go in that
direction&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded. "That is not the direction of
Lo-har&mdash;it is straight ahead, in the direction we have been
traveling."</p>

<p>"A great lake lies to our left," she explained. "We have had
to make a detour to pass around it. You cannot see it from here
because it lies in a deep basin rimmed by cliffs."</p>

<p>"You are not going alone," he said. "I am going with you."</p>

<p>"Haven't I made it clear to you many times that I do not want
you to come with me? How many times must I tell you that I do not
like you? Go away and leave me. Let me go back to my own people
in peace."</p>

<p>Von Horst flushed. Bitter words were in his throat, but he
choked them. All he said was, "I am going with you, because
I&mdash;because&mdash;well, because you can't go on alone."</p>

<p>She rose. "I do not need you, and I do not want you," she
said; then she went and lay down in the shade of a tree to
sleep.</p>

<p>Von Horst sat brooding disconsolately. Old White, his meal
finished, drank from the stream beside the camp and came and
stood beneath a nearby tree, dozing. Von Horst knew that he would
remain there and constitute a better guard than any man; so he
stretched himself upon the ground and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, Old White was still standing in the shade, his
great shaggy body rocking gently to and fro; the herds still
grazed over the broad plain; the eternal noon-day sun still shone
down serenely upon the peaceful scene. He might have slept for no
more than a minute; or, he realized, he might have been sleeping
for a week of outer-earthly time. He looked for La-ja. She was
not where he had last seen her. A sudden presentiment of evil
brought him to his feet. He looked quickly in all directions. The
girl was nowhere in sight. He called her name aloud again and
again, but there was no response.</p>

<p>Then he went quickly to where she had been sleeping and
searched the ground in the vicinity of the camp. There was no
sign that either man or beast had been there other than
themselves; but this was not entirely strange, as the grass,
close cropped by the grazing herds, would have registered no sign
of an ordinary passing.</p>

<p>Presently he dismissed the possibility that La-ja had been
taken forcibly by either beast or man. Had such an attempt been
made she would have called to him for help, and surely Old White
would have protected the camp from any intruder. There was but
one explanation&mdash;La-ja had gone on alone, eluding him. She
had told him that she did not want him to come with her. His
insistence that he would come anyway had left her no alternative
other than the thing she had done&mdash;she had simply run away
from him.</p>

<p>His pride was hurt, but that hurt was as nothing to the ache
in his heart. The bottom had dropped out of his world. There
seemed nothing in life to look forward to. What was he to do?
Where might he go? He had no idea where Sari lay, and only in
Sari might he hope to find a friend in all this vast, savage
world. But only for a moment was he undecided; then he called to
Old White, and at his command the beast swung him to its back. As
the mammoth moved off, von Horst guided it in the new direction
La-ja had pointed out before they had slept. His mind was made
up. He was going to Lo-har. While life remained in him he would
not give up hope of winning the girl he loved.</p>

<p>He urged Old White on in the hope of overtaking the girl. Not
knowing how long he had slept he had no idea how far ahead of him
she might be. She had told him that Lo-har lay but a single march
from their last camp site, yet on and on they went until he was
half dead with fatigue; and at last Old White refused to go
farther without rest, yet there was neither sign of La-ja nor of
any village nor even of the great lake that she had told him they
must skirt.</p>

<p>He wondered if he were searching in the right direction, for
it was easily possible that the village might lie either to the
right or left of his line of march; but it seemed strange that he
should have passed close to any village without seeing some sign
of man. Hunting parties were always abroad, and the sight of a
stranger would have brought them to investigate and probably to
have killed. He banked on his acquaintance with La-ja, however,
to get him a peaceable hearing from her father, Brun, the chief,
when it was his intention to ask to be taken into the tribe.</p>

<p>At last he was forced to halt that Old White might feed and
rest; but it was not until they finally did so beside a stream
that he realized how much he, too, was in need of both food and
sleep. He had brought with him, wrapped in its own hide, some of
the antelope he had killed at his last camp; and upon this and
some fruit he broke his long fast; then he slept.</p>

<p>He must have slept for a long time, for he was very tired; but
with his safety assured by the watchful presence of Old White he
slept soundly. When he awoke, something was touching his breast.
He did not immediately open his eyes, for he recognized the feel
of the moist tip of Old White's trunk upon his naked flesh. He
just lay there luxuriating in the sensuous delight of the brief,
lazy moments that lie between awakening and full consciousness.
But as consciousness returned, bringing command of all the
senses, he gradually became aware of an odor that was not the
odor of Old White. It was a strong, acrid scent; and slowly he
raised his lids.</p>

<p>A sudden numbness seized him as he recognized the creature
that stood over him sniffing at his body with its moist muzzle
moving over his bare flesh. It was that most gigantic and feared
of all Pellucidarian beasts of prey, the ryth, a colossal cave
bear long extinct upon the outer crust.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes again and feigned death, for he had heard
that a bear will not maul a dead body unless it is its own kill.
He had little belief in the truth of the statement, but it was
the proverbial straw and the only one. All that he could do was
lie still and hope for the best.</p>

<p>The nose left his body. There was no sound but the breathing
of the beast. What was it doing? The suspense was maddening, and
at last he could endure it no longer. The bear was standing over
him with its head turned to one side, looking away, sniffing,
listening. Von Horst lay in a gentle depression beneath a wide-
spreading tree. He could see but a short distance in the
direction the bear was looking. Nor could the bear see farther
than the summit of the gentle slope that ran down to the bank of
the stream beside which von Horst lay, but it must have scented
or heard something approaching.</p>

<p>Von Horst thought that it must be Old White returning. He must
have wandered much farther from camp than usual. There would be a
battle royal when he returned and saw the ryth menacing his
friend. The man knew that Old White was afraid of nothing, and he
knew the reputation of the mighty cave bear for fearlessness and
bellicosity. He had been told that one of these great beasts
could kill a mammoth with a single blow of its mighty paw; but
Old White was not just <i>a</i> mammoth; he was <i>the</i>
mammoth. The mammoth-men had said there was never one like him
for size and ferocity and cunning. And then a man topped the rise
and walked in full view of the bear and von Horst. He was
quartering down the slope so that he was not facing them
directly; and he had not yet seen them, for they were in the
dense shade of the tree.</p>

<p>He was half way down the slope, and von Horst thought the bear
was going to let him pass, when he saw them. Simultaneously von
Horst recognized him. It was Daj, the young warrior from Lo-har
whom he had met in the little canyon in Ja-ru, the land of the
mammoth-men.</p>

<p>When Daj saw the bear he looked for the nearest tree. It was
man's only defense against such a creature. As he started to run,
the bear voiced a deafening roar and started for him. Von Horst
sprang to his feet. He was saved, for he could clamber into the
tree above now before the bear could turn and reach him. But what
of Daj? The tree nearest him was evidently a little too far away
to be reached before the bear overtook him, yet Daj was straining
very muscle to reach it.</p>

<p>As von Horst had risen he had gathered up his bow and arrows
that had lain on the ground beside him. In them he saw a
possibility of saving Daj. Fitting an arrow to his bow he took
aim and let drive. The missile sank deep in the bear's rump
eliciting a roar of rage and pain and bringing it around with an
alacrity and agility that belied its great bulk as it sought the
temerarious creature that dared assault it; and upon the instant,
without a pause, it charged von Horst.</p>

<p>He had saved Daj; but perhaps he had underestimated the safety
of his own position, for he had not reckoned with the surprising
agility and speed of the enormous ryth.</p>

<p>The instant that he had loosed the first arrow he had fitted
another to his bow which he bent now until the point of the arrow
rested upon his thumb, and when he loosed it he drooped his
weapon and sprang for a tree branch directly above him.</p>

<p>He did not know if he had scored a hit or not. The bear did
not pause, but came thundering down upon him. He felt the wind of
its raking talons against his legs as he drew them to the safety
of the tree. A deep sigh of relief registered acknowledgement of
his escape from a seemingly hopeless situation.</p>

<p>When he looked down he saw the bear standing beneath him
pawing at the feathered shaft that protruded from the left side
of its chest. It was roaring, but not so strongly now; and blood
was flowing from its mouth. Von Horst saw that his last shot had
delivered a serious wound, though perhaps not fatal. Those
mighty, prehistoric creatures were most tenacious of life.</p>

<p>The bear pawed viciously at the shaft and then sprawled
forward, struggled spasmodically, and lay still. Von Horst
guessed that it had driven or twisted the arrow into its own
heart, but he did not venture down at once. He looked for Daj but
could not see him, as much foliage intervened; then he called his
name aloud.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" came the answer.</p>

<p>"The mammoth-men called me Von; we met in the little canyon.
Now do you recall me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Because of you I escaped death that day. I could not
very well forget you. What has happened to the bear? It is lying
down. It looks as though it were dead, but what could have killed
it?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I make sure that it's dead," cautioned von Horst.
"If it is, we'll come down."</p>

<p>With his stone knife he hacked a branch from the tree and
threw it down upon the bear. As the beast gave no sign that it
had felt it, von Horst was satisfied that it was dead, and
slipped down to the ground.</p>

<p>As he was retrieving his weapons Daj approached him, a
friendly smile upon his face. "Now you have saved my life again,"
he said. "I do not know why, because we are not of the same
tribe."</p>

<p>"We are of the same race," said von Horst; "we are both
gilaks."</p>

<p>The Pellucidarian shrugged. "If everyone felt that way there
would be too many gilaks in Pellucidar and all the game would
soon be killed off."</p>

<p>Von Horst smiled as he thought of the vast area of the inner
world with its handful of inhabitants and of the teeming city
slums of the outer crust.</p>

<p>"For the good of the gilaks of Pellucidar," he said, "may you
never be persuaded to the brotherhood of man."</p>

<p>"I do not know what you are talking about," admitted Daj; "but
what I would like to know is what made the ryth die."</p>

<p>Von Horst showed him the bloody arrows that he had withdrawn
from the carcass. "The one in his chest killed him," he said. "It
punctured his heart."</p>

<p>"Those little slivers of wood killed a ryth!" exclaimed
Daj.</p>

<p>"There was a lot of luck mixed in with them," admitted von
Horst; "but if you get one of them into the heart of anything, it
will kill."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how did you get it in? You couldn't go close enough
to a ryth to stick it in without being killed, and they're too
light to throw in as you might a spear."</p>

<p>Von Horst showed Daj his bow and explained its use, and the
Pellucidarian was much interested. After he had examined it for a
moment he handed it back.</p>

<p>"We'd better move away from here," he said. "That ryth was
down here on the plain hunting. His mate may be around somewhere.
If he doesn't show up she'll follow his scent until she finds
him. This will not be a good place to be."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"To Lo-har," replied Daj. "I have been many sleeps on the way
from Ja-ru, but now I shall be there in three or four more
sleeps."</p>

<p>"Three or four?" demanded von Horst. "I thought I was very
close to Lo-har."</p>

<p>"No," said Daj, "but where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Lo-har," replied von Horst.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I have no other place to go. I am from another world to which
I cannot possibly return. I know one person in Sari who would be
my friend, but I cannot find my way to Sari. In Lo-har I know two
people who should not dislike me. I am going there to ask Brun to
make me a member of the tribe."</p>

<p>"Whom do you know in Lo-har?" asked Daj.</p>

<p>"You and La-ja," replied von Horst.</p>

<p>Daj scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Brun will probably have you killed," he said. "If he doesn't,
Gaz will kill you; but if you want to go to Lo-har, I will take
you. You might as well die there as anywhere."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22">XXII. &mdash; GAZ</a></h2>

<p class="first">Three long marches in the direction from which
he had just come brought von Horst and Daj to the camp site at
which La-ja had deserted the former and convinced him that the
girl had deliberately set him upon the wrong trail. The
realization of this fact, coupled with the desertion of Old
White, disheartened him to such an extent that he seriously
considered abandoning his evidently futile pursuit of La-ja; but
when Daj was ready to set out after they had slept, von Horst
accompanied him; though it only added to his depression when he
found that the route toward Lo-har was that which he and La-ja
had been following up until the moment that she had sent him off
in the wrong direction. One long march brought them to a
sandstone canyon and the cliff-dwellings of Lo-har, where Daj was
received with more show of enthusiasm and affection than von
Horst had previously seen exhibited by the humans of Pellucidar.
But of von Horst they were wary and suspicious, appraising him
with hostile eyes while Daj explained innumerable times that the
stranger was a friend who had liberated him from captivity and
twice saved his life.</p>

<p>"What does he want in Lo-har?" demanded the sentry who had
first halted them at a safe distance from the village, and the
question was constantly repeated by others as they advanced.</p>

<p>In reply Daj explained that von Horst was a great warrior from
another world who wished to come and live in Lo-har, joining the
tribe; and all the while, paying no attention to the muttering
and grumbling about him, von Horst searched for La-ja with eager
eyes.</p>

<p>"Where is Brun?" demanded Daj. "He will decide whether or not
the stranger remains."</p>

<p>"Brun is not here," replied a warrior.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is dead. Many sleeps have passed since he went
away to search for La-ja, his daughter."</p>

<p>"Then who is acting chief now?" asked Daj.</p>

<p>"Gaz," replied the other.</p>

<p>Daj appeared puzzled. "He was chosen by the warriors?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "No; he took the power, threatening
to kill any who interfered. Gaz is a mighty man. No one has as
yet disputed his right, though many would do so if they were not
afraid, for we are not happy under Gaz."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Daj's eyes were wandering about the
village.</p>

<p>"He has gone after La-ja."</p>

<p>Von Horst was instantly alert and attentive.</p>

<p>"Where has she gone?" he asked.</p>

<p>Both the warrior and Daj looked at him questioning, for Daj
knew nothing of von Horst's love for La-ja. "Why do you want to
know, stranger?" demanded the warrior suspiciously.</p>

<p>"If I know where the woman has gone, I shall be able to find
the man."</p>

<p>Daj and the warrior nodded. "That is right," said the former,
and then he asked a question that von Horst had wished to ask but
had not dared. "Why has Gaz gone after La-ja? She has been
missing for many sleeps, and her father has already gone after
her. If Gaz were going after her, why didn't he go before
this?"</p>

<p>"You do not understand." said the warrior. "La-ja returned a
few sleeps ago, and Gaz claimed her as his mate; but she would
have nothing to do with him. When he would have taken her to his
cave by force, she eluded him and ran away."</p>

<p>"And Gaz?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"He followed her. Doubtless before this he has caught her and
she is his mate. It is well for a girl, especially a chiefs
daughter, to show spirit. Gaz will like her better for it. Those
who are too easy to get are not liked for so long a time as the
others. Perhaps La-ja only ran away out of sight of the village
and then waited for Gaz. Many a girl has done this."</p>

<p>"Which way did she go?" demanded von Horst again. His voice
was hoarse and dead in his throat.</p>

<p>"If you know what is well for you you will not interfere with
Gaz now but wait until he returns. He will be bad enough then. If
I were you, stranger, I'd get as far away from Lo-har as I could
before Gaz comes back."</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?" repeated von Horst.</p>

<p>The warrior shook his head. "That way," he said, pointing up
the canyon. "Beyond the divide at the head of the canyon is a
beautiful valley. It is such a place as a man might take his
woman&mdash;or a woman lure her man."</p>

<p>Von Horst shuddered; then without a word he set off toward the
head of the canyon and the beautiful valley to which a woman
might lure her man.</p>

<p>The warrior and Daj stood looking after him. The latter shook
his head. "It is too bad," he said; "he is a great warrior and a
good friend."</p>

<p>The warrior shrugged. "What difference does it make?" he
asked. "Gaz will only kill him a little sooner; that is all."</p>

<p>As von Horst clambered the steep ascent at the head of the
canyon his mind was a turmoil of hopes and fears and
passion&mdash;of love and hate. The last vestige of centuries of
civilization had fallen away, leaving him a stark cave man of the
stone age. As some primitive ancestor of the outer crust may have
done eons before, he sought his rival with murder in his heart.
As for the woman he desired, he would take her now whether she
wished it or not.</p>

<p>Beyond the summit he looked down into the most beautiful
valley he had ever seen, but he gave it scarcely a glance. What
his eyes sought was something far more beautiful. He sought for
some sign of the direction in which the two had gone as he
dropped down toward the floor of the valley, and at last he found
it in a well marked game trail that wound beside a little stream
that meandered down toward a larger river that he could faintly
distinguish in the haze of the distance. Here was an occasional
print of a tiny sandaled foot and often overlapping them those of
a large foot that could have belonged only to a huge man.</p>

<p>Von Horst started along the trail at a trot. He wanted to call
the girl's name aloud; but he knew that she would not reply even
though she heard him, for had she not made it plain that a love
such as his could arouse no corresponding emotion. He wondered
vaguely what had become of his pride, that he could pursue a
woman who hated him and have it in his heart to take her by force
against her will. He thought that he should be ashamed of
himself, but he was not. For a while he was puzzled; and then he
realized that he had changed&mdash;that he was not the same man
who had entered the inner world God only knew how long ago.
Environment had metamorphosed him&mdash;savage Pellucidar had
claimed him as her own.</p>

<p>The very thought of Gaz raised him to a fury. He realized that
he had been hating the man for longer than he knew. He had no
fear of him, as he had no fear of death. Perhaps it was the
latter that kept him from fearing Gaz, for from all that he had
heard of the man Gaz spelled death.</p>

<p>At a steady trot he pushed on. How far ahead they were he had
no way of knowing. How much of truth or falsity there was in the
insinuations of the warrior who had set him on the trail he could
not even guess&mdash;the very thought of them made him frantic,
the thought that he might be too late; but what was even worse
was the haunting fear that La-ja had come willing and waited. She
had told him that it was her duty to mate with a mighty warrior,
and why not Gaz? Von Horst groaned aloud and quickened his pace.
If ever a man suffered the tortures of the damned, it was he.</p>

<p>He came upon a place where the trail branched, a smaller, less
worn trail running off at right angles toward the stream that lay
to his right. After a moment's careful inspection he determined
that the two he sought had taken the smaller trail, and in the
mud of both river banks at the crossing he again found the spoor,
this time well defined. From there the trail ran directly into
the mouth of a small side canyon, and afterward he had only to
follow the floor of the canyon upward. Presently he heard a
commotion ahead and the hoarse voice of a man shouting. He could
not distinguish the words. The voice came from beyond a bend in
the canyon which hid the speaker from his sight.</p>

<p>From now on he should have gone cautiously, but he did not.
Instead he pushed on even faster, taking no precautions; and thus
he came suddenly upon Gaz and La-ja. The latter was clinging
precariously to a tiny ledge upon the face of a lofty escarpment.
Her feet rested upon this narrow support, her body was flattened
against the face of the cliff, her arms were outspread, her palms
pressed tightly against the hard stone. Gaz, unable to scale the
cliff, stood on the ground below shouting orders for La-ja to
descend to him. At sight of the two and their positions that so
eloquently told a story, von Horst breathed a sigh of
relief&mdash;he had not been too late!</p>

<p>Suddenly Gaz picked up a rock and hurled it at La-ja. "Come
down!" he roared, "or I'll knock you down." The rock struck the
face of the cliff close beside La-ja's head. Gaz stooped to take
up another.</p>

<p>Von Horst shouted at him, and the man wheeled in surprise. The
man from the outer crust reached over his shoulder for an arrow
to fit to his bow. He had no compunctions whatsoever about
shooting down a man armed only with a crude spear and a stone
knife. To his astonishment, he found that his quiver was empty.
Where could his arrows have gone? He was sure he had had them
when he entered the village. Then he recalled how the natives had
pulled and hauled him around, milling and pressing against him.
It must have been then that someone had taken his arrows.</p>

<p>Gaz was coming toward him belligerently. "Who are you?" he
demanded. "What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"I have come for you, Gaz," replied von Horst. "I have come to
kill you and take the girl for myself."</p>

<p>Gaz roared and came on. He thought it a huge joke that any
warrior should challenge his supremacy. La-ja turned her head far
enough so that she could look down. What were her feelings when
she recognized von Horst, as she must have done immediately? Who
may know? As a matter of fact she gave no indication that she
even saw him; but once, a moment later, when he glanced away from
Gaz momentarily, von Horst saw that the girl was descending. What
her intentions were, he could not even guess. She might be going
to help the man of her choice in the impending battle, or she
might be going to take advantage of the preoccupation of the two
men to run away again.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Gaz. "I never saw you before."</p>

<p>"I am von Horst, and La-ja is my woman," growled the
other.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"You're the man I've crossed a world to kill," replied von
Horst. "You're Gaz."</p>

<p>"Go away!" shouted La-ja. "Go away before Gaz kills you. I
won't have you&mdash;not if you killed a thousand Gazes would I
have you. Run! Run while you can." Von Horst looked at Gaz. He
was a monster-man, an enormous, bearded fellow who might have
weighed well over three hundred pounds; and he was as gross and
repulsive and brutal in appearance as he was large. His snaggle
teeth were bared in a snarl as he charged von Horst. The latter
had no fear. He had met warriors of the stone age before. They
had no skill; and the hairy, massive bodies of some of them,
suggested strength far greater than they possessed. Von Horst had
discovered that he was stronger than any he had met. They had had
only an advantage in weight, nor was that always an advantage; as
it lessened their agility.</p>

<p>Von Horst's patience with La-ja was at an end. He wanted to be
done with Gaz as quickly as possible so that he could take the
girl in hand. He even contemplated giving her a sound beating. He
thought that she deserved it. He was thinking in terms of the
stone age.</p>

<p>As Gaz charged down upon him, von Horst struck him a heavy
blow in the face as he stepped aside out of the path of the huge
body. Gaz staggered and let out a bellow of rage, and as he
turned to rush von Horst again he drew his stone knife from his G
string. He, too, wished to end the duel at once; for he was
crazed with chagrin that this smaller man had defied him and had
done the first damage in the fight&mdash;all in the presence of
the woman he had chosen to be his mate. Much more of the same and
he would be the laughing stock of the village.</p>

<p>Von Horst saw the weapon in Gaz's hand and drew his own. This
time he waited, and Gaz came in more slowly. When he was quite
near von Horst, he leaped in, swinging a terrific knife blow at
his antagonist's chest. Von Horst parried with his left arm,
plunged his blade into Gaz's side, and leaped away; but as he did
so, his foot struck a stone protruding above the ground, and he
went down. Instantly Gaz was on top of him, hurling his great
carcass full upon the body of his fallen antagonist. One great
paw reached for von Horst's throat, the other drove the stone
blade down toward his heart.</p>

<p>The European caught the other's wrist, stopping the descending
knife; but with his other hand Gaz was choking the life from him,
and at the same time he was trying to wrench his knife hand free
and plunge the weapon into von Horst's heart. As von Horst had
fallen he had dropped his own knife. Now, while he held Gaz's
weapon from him he groped for his own on the ground about him.
Occasionally he relinquished his search to strike Gaz a heavy
blow in the face, which always caused him to loosen his hold upon
the other's throat, giving von Horst an opportunity to gulp in a
mouthful of fresh air; but the man from the outer world realized
that he was weakening rapidly and that unless he found his knife
the end would come quickly.</p>

<p>He had struck Gaz again heavily, and when he reached down
again to grope for his weapon his hand contacted it immediately,
as though someone had placed it in his grasp. He did not pause
then to seek an explanation; in fact the only thing that mattered
was that he possessed the knife.</p>

<p>He saw Gaz glance back and heard him curse; then he drove his
blade deep into the left side of the caveman. Gaz screamed and,
releasing his hold on von Horst's throat, sought to seize his
knife arm; but the other eluded him, and again and again the
stone knife was driven into his bleeding side.</p>

<p>Then Gaz tried to get up and away from von Horst, but the
latter seized his beard and held him. Relentlessly he struck
again and again. Gaz's roars and screams diminished. His body
commenced to slump; then, with a final shudder, it collapsed upon
the victor.</p>

<p>Von Horst pushed it aside and rose. Panting, blood-covered, he
looked about for the woman&mdash;his woman now. He saw her
standing there nearby wide-eyed, incredulous. She came slowly
toward him. "You have killed Gaz!" she said in an awed
whisper.</p>

<p>"And what of it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you could do it. I thought that he would kill
you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to disappoint you," he snapped. "I wonder if you
realize what it means."</p>

<p>"I am not disappointed," she said. "And what does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that I am going to take you. You are mine. Do you
understand? You are mine!"</p>

<p>A slow smile broke like sunlight through the clouds of
doubt.</p>

<p>"I have been yours almost from the first," she said, "but you
were too stupid to realize it."</p>

<p>"What?" he ejaculated. "What do you mean? You have done
nothing but repulse me and try to drive me away from you. When I
slept, you ran off and left me after directing me on the wrong
trail."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I did all those things. I did them
because I loved you. I knew that if I told you I returned your
love you would follow me to Lo-har, and I thought that if you
came here you would be killed. How could I guess that you could
kill Gaz, whom no man has ever before been able to kill?"</p>

<p>"La-ja!" he whispered, and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>Together they returned to the village of Lo-har. The warriors
and the women clustered about them.</p>

<p>"Where is Gaz?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Gaz is dead," said La-ja.</p>

<p>"Then we have no chief."</p>

<p>"Here is your chief," replied the girl, laying a hand upon von
Horst's shoulder.</p>

<p>Some of the warriors laughed, others grumbled. "He is a
stranger. What has he done that he should be chief?"</p>

<p>"When Brun went away, you let Gaz be chief because you were
afraid of him. You hated him; and he was a poor chief, but none
of you was brave enough to try to kill him, Von killed Gaz in a
fair fight with knives, and he has taken the daughter of your
chief as mate. Until Brun returns what warrior among you is
better qualified to be chief than Von? If any thinks differently
let him step forward and fight Von with his bare hands."</p>

<p>And so Lieutenant Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und
von Horst became chief of the cliff-dwellers of Lo-har. He was a
wise chief, for he combined with the psychology of the cave man,
that he had acquired, all the valuable knowledge of another
environment. He became almost a god to them, so that they no
longer regretted the loss of Brun.</p>

<p>And then, after a while, came rumors of a strange people that
were reported to have come up out of the south. They had weapons
against which neither man nor beast could stand&mdash;weapons
that made a great noise and vomited smoke and killed at a
distance.</p>

<p>When von Horst heard these rumors he thrilled with excitement.
Such men could only be members of the company that had come from
the outer crust in the giant dirigible O-220&mdash;his friends.
Doubtless they were searching for him. He called his warriors to
him. "I am going out to meet these strangers of whom we have
heard rumors. I think they are my friends. But if they are not my
friends, they will be able to kill many of us with the weapons
they have before we can get near enough to kill them. How many of
you wish to go with me?"</p>

<p>They all volunteered, but he took only about fifty warriors.
La-ja accompanied them, and when they set out they had only the
vaguest of rumors to guide them. But as they went south and
talked with men of other tribes, whom they captured along the
way, the reports became more definite; and then at last von
Horst's scouts came back from the front and reported that they
had seen a body of men camped by a river a short distance
away.</p>

<p>Led by von Horst, the cave-men of Lo-har crept close to the
camp of the strangers. Here von Horst saw armed men who bore
rifles and bandoleers of cartridges. The arrangement and
discipline of the camp, the sentries, the military air assured
him that these people had had contact with civilization. But he
was still too far away to recognize faces if there were any there
that he knew. But of one thing he was confident&mdash;this was no
party from the O-220.</p>

<p>He whispered to his warriors for a moment; then he rose alone
and walked slowly down toward the camp. He had taken but a few
steps in the open before a sentry discovered him and gave the
alarm. Von Horst saw men rise all about the camp and look toward
him. He raised both hands above his head as a sign that he came
in peace. No one spoke as he crossed the open ground to the very
edge of the camp; then a man ran forward with glad cry.</p>

<p>"Von!"</p>

<p>It was a moment before von Horst recognized who it was that
spoke his name. It was Dangar, and behind Dangar were Thorek,
Lotai, and Mumal. Von Horst was astounded. How had these come
together? Who were the armed men?</p>

<p>Presently a tall, fine looking man came forward. "You are
Lieutenant von Horst?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; and you?"</p>

<p>"David Innes. When the O-220 returned to the outer crust and
Jason Gridley decided to go back with it, he made me promise that
I would equip an expedition and make a thorough search for you. I
did so immediately I returned to Sari. I had no luck until some
of my men met Dangar returning to Sari after a long absence. He
guided us to The Forest of Death. Once we had passed through that
we had no idea in what direction to search until we came upon
Thorek, Lotai, and Mumal escaping from the land of the mammoth-
men.</p>

<p>"They told us that they believed that you had escaped, and
they thought you might be searching for Lo-har. We had never
heard of Lo-har, but we succeeded in taking a prisoner who knew
the direction in which the country lay. Later we came upon a man
named Skruf whom you had wounded with an arrow. We promised him
protection and he directed us to the village of the bison-men.
Now we were nearing Lo-har, but still it was difficult to find.
These people only knew the general direction in which it lay. Our
one hope was to capture a Lo-harian. This we did before the last
sleep. He is with us now and guiding us much against his will
toward his own country, for he thinks we will turn upon him and
his people."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked von Horst.</p>

<p>"Brun, the chief of the Lo-harians," replied Innes.</p>

<p>Von Horst signaled for his tribesmen to come in to the camp,
and asked that Brun be brought. Innes sent for him, telling him
that some of his own people had come to meet him. But when Brun
came and saw von Horst he drew himself up very proudly and turned
his back.</p>

<p>"I do not know this man," he said. "He is not of Lo-har."</p>

<p>"Look at those who are coming, Brun," suggested von Horst.
"You will know them all, especially La-ja."</p>

<p>"La-ja!" exclaimed the chief. "I had given her up for dead. I
have searched a world for her."</p>

<p>The men of Lo-har camped with the men of Sari in friendship,
and there was much palaver; and a great deal of food was eaten,
and they slept twice in that one camp before they spoke of
breaking it.</p>

<p>"You will come back to Sari with us, Lieutenant?" asked Innes.
"Gridley may come back on another expedition at any time now; it
may be your only chance to return to the outer crust."</p>

<p>Von Horst glanced at a little, yellow haired cave-girl gnawing
on a bone.</p>

<p>"I am not at all sure that I care to return to the outer
crust," he said.</p>
