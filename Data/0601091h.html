<h2><a id="knife1" name="knife1">I. &mdash; A CRY OUT OF THE
EAST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A CRY from beyond the bolted door&mdash;a thick,
desperate croaking that gaspingly repeated a name. Stuart Brent
paused in the act of filling a whisky glass, and shot a startled
glance toward the door from beyond which that cry had come. It was
his name that had been gasped out&mdash;and why should anyone call
on him with such frantic urgency at midnight in the hall outside
his apartment?</p>

<p>He stepped to the door, without stopping to set down the square
amber bottle. Even as he turned the knob, he was electrified by the
unmistakable sounds of a struggle outside&mdash;the quick fierce
scuff of feet, the thud of blows, then the desperate voice lifted
again. He threw the door open.</p>

<p>The richly appointed hallway outside was dimly lighted by bulbs
concealed in the jaws of gilt dragons writhing across the ceiling.
The costly red rugs and velvet tapestries seemed to drink in this
soft light, heightening an effect of unreality. But the struggle
going on before his eyes was as real as life and death.</p>

<p>There were splashes of a brighter crimson on the dark-red rug. A
man was down on his back before the door, a slender man whose white
face shone like a wax mask in the dim light. Another man crouched
upon him, one knee grinding brutally into his breast, one hand
twisting at the victim's throat. The other hand lifted a
red-smeared blade.</p>

<p>Brent acted entirely through impulse. Everything happened
simultaneously. The knife was swinging up for the downward drive
even as he opened the door. At the height of its arc it hovered
briefly as the wielder shot a venomous, slit- eyed glance at the
man in the doorway. In that instant Brent saw murder about to be
done, saw that the victim was a white man, the killer a swarthy
alien of some kind. Age-old implanted instincts acted through him,
without his conscious volition. He dashed the heavy whisky bottle
full into the dark face with all his power. The hard, stocky body
toppled backward in a crash of broken glass and a shower of
splattering liquor, and the knife rang on the floor several feet
away. With a feline snarl the fellow bounced to his feet, red-eyed,
blood and whisky streaming from his face and over his collar.</p>

<p>For an instant he crouched as if to leap at Brent barehanded.
Then the glare in his eyes wavered, turned to something like fear,
and he wheeled and was gone, lunging down the stair with reckless
haste. Brent stared after him in amazement. The whole affair was
fantastic, and Brent was irritated. He had broken a self-imposed
rule of long standing&mdash;which was never to butt into anything
which was not his business.</p>

<p>"Brent!" It was the wounded man, calling him weakly.</p>

<p>Brent bent down to him.</p>

<p>"What is it, old fellow&mdash;Thunderation! Stockton!"</p>

<p>"Get me in, quick!" panted the other, staring fearfully at the
stair. "He may come back&mdash;with others."</p>

<p>Brent stooped and lifted him bodily. Stockton was not a bulky
man, and Brent's trim frame concealed the muscles of an athlete.
There was no sound throughout the building. Evidently no one had
been aroused by the muffled sounds of the brief fight. Brent
carried the wounded man into the room and laid him carefully on a
divan. There was blood on Brent's hands when he straightened.</p>

<p>"Lock the door!" gasped Stockton.</p>

<p>Brent obeyed, and then turned back, frowning concernedly down at
the man. They offered a striking contrast&mdash;Stockton,
light-haired, of medium height, frail, with plain, commonplace
features now twisted in a grimace of pain, his sober garments
disheveled and smeared with blood; Brent, tall, dark, immaculately
tailored, handsome in a virile masculine way, and selfassured. But
in Stockton's pale eyes there blazed a fire that burned away the
difference between them, and gave the wounded man something that
Brent did not possess&mdash;something that dominated the scene.</p>

<p>"You're hurt, Dick!" Brent caught up a fresh whisky bottle.
"Why, man, you're stabbed to pieces! I'll call a doctor,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" A lean hand brushed aside the whisky glass and seized
Brent's wrist. "It's no use. I'm bleeding inside. I'd be dead now,
but I can't leave my job unfinished. Don't interrupt just
listen!"</p>

<p>Brent knew Stockton spoke the truth. Blood was oozing thinly
from the wounds in his breast, where a thin-bladed knife must have
struck home at least half a dozen times. Brent looked on, awed and
appalled, as the small, bright- eyed man fought death to a
standstill, gripping the last fading fringes of life and keeping
himself conscious and lucid to the end by the sheer effort of an
iron will.</p>

<p>"I stumbled on something big tonight, down in a water-front
dive. I was looking for something else uncovered this by accident.
Then <i>they</i> got suspicious. I got away&mdash;came here because
you were the only man I knew in San Francisco. But that devil was
after me&mdash;caught me on the stair."</p>

<p>Blood oozed from the livid lips, and Stockton spat dryly. Brent
looked on helplessly. He knew the man was a secret agent of the
British government, who had made a business of tracing sinister
secrets to their source. He was dying as he had lived, in the
harness.</p>

<p>"Something big!" whispered the Englishman. "Something that
balances the fate of India! I can't tell you all now&mdash;I'm
going fast. But there's one man in the world who must know. You
must find him, Brent! His name is Gordon&mdash;Francis Xavier
Gordon. He's an American; the Afghans call him El Borak. I'd have
gone to him&mdash;but you must go. Promise me!"</p>

<p>Brent did not hesitate. His soothing hand on the dying man's
shoulder was even more convincing and reassuring than his quiet,
level voice.</p>

<p>"I promise, old man. But where am I to find him?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in Afghanistan. Go at once. Tell the police nothing.
Spies are all around. If they know I knew you, and spoke with you
before I died, they'll kill you before you can reach Gordon. Tell
the police I was simply a drunken stranger, wounded by an unknown
party, and staggering into your hall to die. You never saw me
before. I said nothing before I died.</p>

<p>"Go to Kabul. The British officials will make your way easy that
far. Simply say to each one: "Remember the kites of Khoral Nulla."
That's your password. If Gordon isn't in Kabul, the ameer will give
you an escort to hunt for him in the hills. You must find him! The
peace of India depends on him, now!"</p>

<p>"But what shall I tell him?" Brent was bewildered.</p>

<p>"Say to him," gasped the dying man, fighting fiercely for a few
more moments of life, "say: 'The Black Tigers had a new prince;
they call him Abd el Khafid, but his real name is Vladimir
Jakrovitch.'"</p>

<p>"Is that all?" This affair was growing more and more
bizarre.</p>

<p>"Gordon will understand and act. The Black Tigers are your
peril. They're a secret society of Asiatic murderers. Therefore, be
on your guard at every step of the way. But El Borak will
understand. He'll know where to look for Jakrovitch&mdash;in Rub el
Harami&mdash;the Abode of Thieves&mdash;"</p>

<p>A convulsive shudder, and the slim thread that had held the life
in the tortured body snapped.</p>

<p>Brent straightened and looked down at the dead man in wonder. He
shook his head, marveling again at the inner unrest that sent men
wandering in the waste places of the world, playing a game of life
and death for a meager wage. Games that had gold for their stake
Brent could understand&mdash;none better. His strong, sure fingers
could read the cards almost as a man reads books; but he could not
read the souls of men like Richard Stockton who stake their lives
on the bare boards where Death is the dealer. What if the man won,
how could he measure his winnings, where cash his chips? Brent
asked no odds of life; he lost without a wince; but in winning, he
was a usurer, demanding the last least crumb of the wager, and
content with nothing less than the glittering, solid materialities
of life. The grim and barren game Stockton had played held no
promise for Stuart Brent, and to him the Englishman had always been
a little mad.</p>

<p>But whatever Brent's faults or virtues, he had his code. He
lived by it, and by it he meant to die. The foundation stone of
that code was loyalty. Stockton had never saved Brent's life,
renounced a girl both loved, exonerated him from a false
accusation, or anything so dramatic. They had simply been boyhood
friends in a certain British university, years ago, and years had
passed between their occasional meetings since then. Stockton had
no claim on Brent, except for their old friendship. But that was a
tie as solid as a log chain, and the Englishman had known it, when,
in the desperation of knowing himself doomed, he had crawled to
Brent's door. And Brent had given his promise, and he intended
making it good. It did not occur to him that there was any other
alternative. Stuart Brent was the restless black sheep of an
aristocratic old California family whose founder crossed the plains
in an ox wagon in '49&mdash;and he had never welshed a bet nor let
down a friend.</p>

<p>He turned his head and stared through a window, almost hidden by
its satin curtains. He was comfortable here. His luck had been
phenomenal of late. Tomorrow evening there was a big poker game
scheduled at his favorite club, with a fat Oklahoma oil king who
was ripe for a cleaning. The races began at Tia Juana within a few
days, and Brent had his eye on a slim sorrel gelding that ran like
the flame of a prairie fire.</p>

<p>Outside, the fog curled and drifted, beading the pane. Pictures
formed for him there&mdash;prophetic pictures of an East different
from the colorful civilized East he had touched in his roamings.
Pictures not at all like the European-dominated cities he
remembered, exotic colors of veranda-shaded clubs, soft-footed
servants laden with cooling drinks, languorous and beautiful women,
white garments and sun helmets. Shiveringly he sensed a wilder,
older East; it had blown a scent of itself to him out of the fog,
over a knife stained with human blood. An East not soft and warm
and exotic-colored, but bleak and grim and savage, where peace was
not and law was a mockery, and life hung on the tilt of a balanced
blade. The East known by Stockton, and this mysterious American
they called "El Borak."</p>

<p>Brent's world was here, the world he had promised to abandon for
a blind, quixotic mission; he knew nothing of that other leaner,
fiercer world; but there was no hesitation in his manner as he
turned toward the door.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife2" name="knife2">II. &mdash; THE ROAD TO RUB EL
HARAMI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A WIND blew over the shoulders of the peaks where
the snow lay drifted, a knife-edge wind that slashed through
leather and wadded cloth in spite of the searing sun. Stuart Brent
blinked his eyes against the glare of that intolerable sun,
shivered at the bite of the wind. He had no coat, and his shirt was
tattered. For the thousandth futile, involuntary time, he wrenched
at the fetters on his wrists. They jangled, and the man riding in
front of him cursed, turned and struck him heavily in the mouth.
Brent reeled in his saddle, blood starting to his lips.</p>

<p>The saddle chafed him, and the stirrups were too short for his
long legs. He was riding along a knife-edge trail, in the middle of
a straggling line of some thirty men&mdash;ragged men on gaunt,
ribby horses. They rode hunched in their high-peaked saddles,
turbaned heads thrust forward and nodding in unison to the
<i>clop-clop</i> of their horses' hoofs, long-barreled rifles
swaying across the saddlebows. On one hand rose a towering cliff;
on the other, a sheer precipice fell away into echoing depths. The
skin was worn from Brent's wrists by the rusty, clumsy iron
manacles that secured them; he was bruised from the kicks and
blows, faint with hunger and giddy with the enormousness of the
altitude. His nose bled at times without having been struck. Ahead
of them loomed the backbone of the gigantic range that had risen
like a rampart before them for so many days.</p>

<p>Dizzily he reviewed the events of the weeks that stretched
between the time he had carried Dick Stockton, dying, into his
flat, and this unbelievable, yet painfully real moment. The
intervening period of time might have been an unfathomable and
unbridgeable gulf stretching between and dividing two worlds that
had nothing in common save consciousness.</p>

<p>He had come to India on the first ship he could catch. Official
doors had opened to him at the whispered password: "Remember the
kites of Khoral Nulla!" His path had been smoothed by
impressive-looking documents with great red seals, by cryptic
orders barked over telephones, or whispered into attentive ears. He
had moved smoothly northward along hitherto unguessed channels. He
had glimpsed, faintly, some of the shadowy, mountainous machinery
grinding silently and ceaselessly behind the scenes&mdash;the
unseen, half-suspected cogwheels of the empire that girdles the
world.</p>

<p>Mustached men with medals on their breasts had conferred with
him as to his needs, and quiet men in civilian clothes had guided
him on his way. But no one had asked him why he sought El Borak, or
what message he bore. The password and the mention of Stockton had
sufficed. His friend had been more important in the imperial scheme
of things than Brent had ever realized. The adventure had seemed
more and more fantastic as he progressed&mdash;a page out of the
"Arabian Nights", as he blindly carried a dead man's message, the
significance of which he could not even guess, to a mysterious
figure lost in the mists of the hills; while, at a whispered
incantation, hidden doors swung wide and enigmatic figures bowed
him on his way. But all this changed in the North.</p>

<p>Gordon was not in Kabul. This Brent learned from the lips of no
less than the ameer himself&mdash;wearing his European garments as
if born to them, but with the sharp, restless eyes of a man who
knows he is a pawn between powerful rivals, and whose nerves are
worn thin by the constant struggle for survival. Brent sensed that
Gordon was a staff on which the ameer leaned heavily. But neither
king nor agents of empire could chain the American's roving foot,
or direct the hawk flights of the man the Afghans called "El
Borak," the "Swift".</p>

<p>And Gordon was gone&mdash;wandering alone into those naked hills
whose bleak mysteries had long ago claimed him from his own kind.
He might be gone a month, he might be gone a year. He
might&mdash;and the ameer shifted uneasily at the
possibility&mdash;never return. The crag-set villages were full of
his blood enemies.</p>

<p>Not even the long arm of empire reached beyond Kabul. The ameer
ruled the tribes after a fashion&mdash;with a dominance that dared
not presume too far. This was the Country of the Hills, where law
was hinged on the strong arm wielding the long knife.</p>

<p>Gordon had vanished into the Northwest. And Brent, though
flinching at the grim nakedness of the Himalayas, did not hesitate
or visualize an alternative. He asked for and received an escort of
soldiers. With them he pushed on, trying to follow Gordon's trail
through the mountain villages.</p>

<p>A week out of Kabul they lost all trace of him. To all effects
Gordon had vanished into thin air. The wild, shaggy hillmen
answered questions sullenly, or not at all, glaring at the nervous
Kabuli soldiery from under black brows. The farther they got away
from Kabul, the more open the hostility. Only once did a question
evoke a spontaneous response, and that was a suggestion that Gordon
had been murdered by hostile tribesmen. At that, sardonic laughter
yelled up from the wild men&mdash;the fierce, mocking mirth of the
hills. El Borak trapped by his enemies? Is the gray wolf devoured
by the fat-tailed sheep? And another gust of dry, ironic laughter,
as hard as the black crags that burned under a sun of liquid
flame.</p>

<p>Stubborn as his grandsire who had glimpsed a mirage of
tree-fringed ocean shore across the scorching desolation of another
desert, Brent groped on, at a blind venture, trying to pick up the
cold scent, far past the point of safety, as the gray-faced
soldiers warned him again and again. They warned him that they were
far from Kabul, in a sparsely settled, rebellious, little-explored
region, whose wild people were rebels to the ameer, and enemies to
El Borak. They would have deserted Brent long before and fled back
to Kabul, had they not feared the ameer's wrath.</p>

<p>Their forebodings were justified in the hurricane of rifle fire
that swept their camp in a chill gray dawn. Most of them fell at
the first volley that ripped from the rocks about them. The rest
fought futilely, ridden over and cut down by the wild riders that
materialized out of the gray. Brent knew the surprise had been the
soldiers' fault, but he did not have it in his heart to curse them,
even now. They had been like children, sneaking in out of the cold
as soon as his back was turned, sleeping on sentry duty, and
lapsing into slovenly and unmilitary habits as soon as they were
out of sight of Kabul. They had not wanted to come, in the first
place; a foreboding of doom had haunted them; and now they were
dead, and he was a captive, riding toward a fate he could not even
guess.</p>

<p>Four days had passed since that slaughter, but he still turned
sick when he remembered it&mdash;the smell of powder and blood, the
screams, the rending chop of steel. He shuddered at the memory of
the man he had killed in that last rush, with his pistol muzzle
almost in the bearded face that lunged at him beneath a lifted
rifle butt. He had never killed a man before. He sickened as he
remembered the cries of the wounded soldiers when the conquerors
cut their throats. And over and over he wondered why he had been
spared&mdash;why they had overpowered and fettered him, instead of
killing him. His suffering had been so intense he often wished they
had killed him outright.</p>

<p>He was allowed to ride, and he was fed grudgingly when the
others ate. But the food was niggardly. He who had never known
hunger was never without it now, a gnawing misery. His coat had
been taken from him, and the nights were a long agony in which he
almost froze on the hard ground, in the icy winds. He wearied unto
death of the day-long riding over incredible trails that wound up
and up until he felt as if he could reach out a hand&mdash;if his
hands were free&mdash;and touch the cold, pale sky. He was kicked
and beaten until the first fiery resentment and humiliation had
been dissolved in a dull hurt that was only aware of the physical
pain, not of the injury to his self-respect.</p>

<p>He did not know who his captors were. They did not deign to
speak English to him, but he had picked up more than a smattering
of Pashto on that long journey up the Khyber to Kabul, and from
Kabul westward. Like many men who live by their wits, he had the
knack of acquiring new languages. But all he learned from listening
to their conversation was that their leader was called Muhammad ez
Zahir, and their destination was Rub el Harami.</p>

<p>Rub el Harami! Brent had heard it first as a meaningless phrase
gasped from Richard Stockton's blue lips. He had heard more of it
as he came northward from the hot plains of the Punjab&mdash;a city
of mystery and evil, which no white man had ever visited except as
a captive, and from which none had ever escaped. A plague spot,
sprawled in the high, bare hills, almost fabulous, beyond the reach
of the ameer&mdash;an outlaw city, whence the winds blew whispered
tales too fantastic and hideous for credence, even in this Country
of the Knife.</p>

<p>At times Brent's escort mocked him, their burning eyes and
grimly smiling lips lending a sinister meaning to their taunt: "The
Feringi goes to Rub el Harami!"</p>

<p>For the pride of race he stiffened his spine and set his jaw; he
plumbed unsuspected depths of endurance&mdash;legacy of a clean,
athletic life, sharpened by the hard traveling of the past
weeks.</p>

<p>They crossed a rocky crest and dropped down an incline between
ridges that tilted up for a thousand feet. Far above and beyond
them they occasionally glimpsed a notch in the rampart that was the
pass over which they must cross the backbone of the range up which
they were toiling. It was as they labored up a long slope that the
solitary horseman appeared.</p>

<p>The sun was poised on the knife-edge crest of a ridge to the
west, a blood-colored ball, turning a streak of the sky to flame.
Against that crimson ball a horseman appeared suddenly, a centaur
image, black against the blinding curtain. Below him every rider
turned in his saddle, and rifle bolts clicked. It did not need the
barked command of Muhammed ez Zahir to halt the troop. There was
something wild and arresting about that untamed figure in the
sunset that held every eye. The rider's head was thrown back, the
horse's long mane streaming in the wind.</p>

<p>Then the black silhouette detached itself from the crimson ball
and moved down toward them, details springing into being as it
emerged from the blinding background. It was a man on a rangy black
stallion who came down the rocky, pathless slope with the smooth
curving flight of an eagle, the sure hoofs spurning the ground.
Brent, himself a horseman, felt his heart leap into his throat with
admiration for the savage steed.</p>

<p>But he almost forgot the horse when the rider pulled up before
them. He was neither tall nor bulky, but a barbaric strength was
evident in his compact shoulders, his deep chest, his corded
wrists. There was strength, too, in the keen, dark face, and the
eyes, the blackest Brent had even seen, gleamed with an inward fire
such as the American had seen burn in the eyes of wild
things&mdash;an indomitable wildness and an unquenchable vitality.
The thin, black mustache did not hide the hard set of the
mouth.</p>

<p>The stranger looked like a desert dandy beside the ragged men of
the troop, but it was a dandyism definitely masculine, from the
silken turban to the silver-heeled boots. His bright-hued robe was
belted with a gold-buckled girdle that supported a Turkish saber
and a long dagger. A rifle jutted its butt from a scabbard beneath
his knee.</p>

<p>Thirty-odd pairs of hostile eyes centered on him, after
suspiciously sweeping the empty ridges behind him as he galloped up
before the troop and reined his steed back on its haunches with a
flourish that set the gold ornaments jingling on curb chains and
reins. An empty hand was flung up in an exaggerated gesture of
peace. The rider, well poised and confident, carried himself with a
definite swagger.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" growled Muhammad ez Zahir, his cocked rifle
covering the stranger.</p>

<p>"A small thing, as Allah is my witness!" declared the other,
speaking Pashto with an accent Brent had never heard before. "I am
Shirkuh, of Jebel Jawur. I ride to Rub el Harami. I wish to
accompany you."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" demanded Muhammad.</p>

<p>"I set forth from Herat many days ago with a party of camel men
who swore they would guide me to Rub el Harami. Last night they
sought to slay and rob me. One of them died suddenly. The others
ran away, leaving me without food or guides. I lost my way, and
have been wandering in the mountains all last night and all this
day. Just now, by the favor of Allah, I sighted your band."</p>

<p>"How do you know we are bound for Rub el Harami?" demanded
Muhammad.</p>

<p>"Are you not Muhammad ez Zahir, the prince of swordsmen?"
countered Shirkuh.</p>

<p>The Afghan's beard bristled with satisfaction. He was not
impervious to flattery. But he was still suspicious.</p>

<p>"You know me, Kurd?"</p>

<p>"Who does not know Muhammad ez Zahir? I saw you in the
<i>suk</i> of Teheran, years ago. And now men say you are high in
the ranks of the Black Tigers."</p>

<p>"Beware how your tongue runs, Kurd!" responded Muhammad. "Words
are sometimes blades to cut men's throats. Are you sure of a
welcome in Rub el Harami?"</p>

<p>"What stranger can be sure of a welcome there?" Shirkuh laughed.
"But there is Feringi blood on my sword, and a price on my head. I
have heard that such men were welcome in Rub el Harami."</p>

<p>"Ride with us if you will," said Muhammad. "I will get you
through the Pass of Nadir Khan. But what may await you at the city
gates is none of my affair. I have not invited you to Rub el
Harami. I accept no responsibility for you."</p>

<p>"I ask for no man to vouch for me," retorted Shirkuh, with a
glint of anger, brief and sharp, like the flash of hidden steel
struck by a flint and momentarily revealed. He glanced curiously at
Brent.</p>

<p>"Has there been a raid over the border?" he asked.</p>

<p>"This fool came seeking someone," scornfully answered Muhammad.
"He walked into a trap set for him."</p>

<p>"What will be done with him in Rub el Harami?" pursued the
newcomer, and Brent's interest in the conversation suddenly became
painfully intense.</p>

<p>"He will be placed on the slave block," answered Muhammad,
"according to the age-old custom of the city. Who bids highest will
have him."</p>

<p>And so Brent learned the fate in store for him, and cold sweat
broke out on his flesh as he contemplated a life spent as a
tortured drudge to some turbaned ruffian. But he held up his head,
feeling Shirkuh's fierce eyes upon him.</p>

<p>The stranger said slowly: "It may be his destiny to serve
Shirkuh, of the Jebel Jawur! I never owned a slave&mdash;but who
knows? It strikes my fancy to buy this Feringi!"</p>

<p>Brent reflected that Shirkuh must know that he was in no danger
of being murdered and robbed, or he would never so openly imply
possession of money. That suggested that he knew these were picked
men, carrying out someone's instructions so implicitly that they
could be depended on not to commit any crime not included in those
orders. That implied organization and obedience beyond the
conception of any ordinary hill chief. He was convinced that these
men belonged to that mysterious cult against which Stockton had
warned him&mdash;the Black Tigers. Then had their capture of him
been due merely to chance? It seemed improbable.</p>

<p>"There are rich men in Rub el Harami, Kurd," growled Muhammad.
"But it may be that none will want this Feringi and a wandering
vagabond like you might buy him. Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Only in Allah is knowledge," agreed Shirkuh, and swung his
horse into line behind Brent, crowding a man out of position and
laughing when the Afghan snarled at him.</p>

<p>The troop got into motion, and a man leaned over to strike Brent
with a rifle butt. Shirkuh checked the stroke. His lips laughed,
but there was menace in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nay! This infidel may belong to me before many days, and I will
not have his bones broken!"</p>

<p>The man growled, but did not press the matter, and the troop
rode on. They toiled up a ridge in a long shadow cast by the crag
behind which the sun had sunk, and came into a valley and the sight
of the sun again, just sinking behind a mountain. As they went down
the slope, they spied white turbans moving among the crags to the
west, and Muhammad ez Zahir snarled in suspicion at Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"Are they friends of yours, you dog? You said you were
alone!"</p>

<p>"I know them not!" declared Shirkuh. Then he dragged his rifle
from its boot. "The dogs fire on us!" For a tiny tongue of fire had
jetted from among the boulders in the distance, and a bullet whined
overhead.</p>

<p>"Hill-bred dogs who grudge us the use of the well ahead!" said
Muhammad ez Zahir. "Would we had time to teach them a lesson! Hold
your fire, you dogs! The range is too long for either they or us to
do damage."</p>

<p>But Shirkuh wheeled out of the line of march and rode toward the
foot of the ridge. Half a dozen men broke cover, high up on the
slope, and dashed away over the crest, leaning low and spurring
hard. Shirkuh fired once, then took steadier aim and fired three
shots in swift succession.</p>

<p>"You missed!" shouted Muhammad angrily. "Who could hit at such a
range?"</p>

<p>"Nay!" yelled Shirkuh. "Look!"</p>

<p>One of the ragged white shapes had wavered and pitched forward
on its pony's neck. The beast vanished over the ridge, its rider
lolling limply in the saddle.</p>

<p>"He will not ride far!" exulted Shirkuh, waving his rifle over
his head as he raced back to the troop. "We Kurds have eyes like
mountain hawks!"</p>

<p>"Shooting a Pathan hill thief does not make a hero," snapped
Muhammad, turning disgustedly away.</p>

<p>But Shirkuh merely laughed tolerantly, as one so sure of his
fame that he could afford to overlook the jealousies of lesser
souls.</p>

<p>They rode on down into the broad valley, seeing no more of the
hillmen. Dusk was falling when they halted beside the well. Brent,
too stiff to dismount, was roughly jerked off his horse. His legs
were bound, and he was allowed to sit with his back against a
boulder just far enough away from the fires they built to keep him
from benefiting any from the heat. No guard was set over him at
present.</p>

<p>Presently Shirkuh came striding over to where the prisoner
gnawed at the wretched crusts they allowed him. Shirkuh walked with
a horseman's roll, setting his booted legs wide. He carried an iron
bowl of stewed mutton, and some chupatties.</p>

<p>"Eat, Feringi!" he commanded roughly, but not harshly. "A slave
whose ribs jut through his hide is no good to work or to fight.
These niggardly Pathans would starve their grandfathers. But we
Kurds are as generous as we are valiant!"</p>

<p>He offered the food with a gesture as of bestowing a province.
Brent accepted it without thanks, and ate voraciously. Shirkuh had
dominated the drama ever since he had entered it&mdash;a
swashbuckler who swaggered upon the stage and would not be ignored.
Even Muhammad ez Zahir was overshadowed by the overflowing vitality
of the man. Shirkuh seemed a strange mixture of brutal barbarian
and unsophisticated youth. There was a boyish exuberance in his
swagger, and he displayed touches of naive simplicity at times. But
there was nothing childish about his glittering black eyes, and he
moved with a tigerish suppleness that Brent knew could be
translated instantly into a blur of murderous action.</p>

<p>Shirkuh thrust his thumbs in his girdle now and stood looking
down at the American as he ate. The light from the nearest fire of
dry tamarisk branches threw his dark face into shadowy half relief
and gave it somehow an older, more austere look. The shadowy half
light had erased the boyishness from his countenance, replacing it
with a suggestion of somberness.</p>

<p>"Why did you come into the hills?" he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>Brent did not immediately answer; he chewed on, toying with an
idea. He was in as desperate a plight as he could be in, and he saw
no way out. He looked about, seeing that his captors were out of
earshot. He did not see the dim shape that squirmed up behind the
boulder against which he leaned. He reached a sudden decision and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you know the man called El Borak?"</p>

<p>Was there suspicion suddenly in the black eyes?</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," Shirkuh replied warily:</p>

<p>"I came into the hills looking for him. Can you find him? If you
could get a message to him, I would pay you thirty thousand
rupees."</p>

<p>Shirkuh scowled, as if torn between suspicion and avarice.</p>

<p>"I am a stranger in these hills," he said. "How could I find El
Borak?"</p>

<p>"Then help me to escape," urged Brent. "I will pay you an equal
sum."</p>

<p>Shirkuh tugged his mustache.</p>

<p>"I am one sword against thirty," he growled. "How do I know I
would be paid? Feringi are all liars. I am an outlaw with a price
on my head. The Turks would flay me, the Russians would shoot me,
the British would hang me. There is nowhere I can go except to Rub
el Harami. If I helped you to escape, that door would be barred
against me, too."</p>

<p>"I will speak to the British for you," urged Brent. "El Borak
has power. He will secure a pardon for you."</p>

<p>He believed what he said; besides, he was in that desperate
state when a man is likely to promise anything.</p>

<p>Indecision flickered in the black eyes, and Shirkuh started to
speak, then changed his mind, turned on his heel, and strode away.
A moment later the spy crouching behind the boulders glided away
without having been discovered by Brent, who sat staring in despair
after Shirkuh.</p>

<p>Shirkuh went straight to Muhammad, gnawing strips of dried
mutton as he sat cross-legged on a dingy sheepskin near a small
fire on the other side of the well. Shirkuh got there before the
spy did.</p>

<p>"The Feringi has offered me money to take a word to El Borak,"
he said abruptly. "Also to aid him to escape. I bade him go to
Jehannum, of course. In the Jebel Jawur I have heard of El Borak,
but I have never seen him. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A devil," growled Muhammad ez Zahir. "An American, like this
dog. The tribes about the Khyber are his friends, and he is an
adviser of the ameer, and an ally of the rajah, though he was once
an outlaw. He has never dared come to Rub el Harami. I saw him
once, three years ago, in the fight by Kalat-i- Ghilzai, where he
and his cursed Afridis broke the back of the revolt that had else
unseated the ameer. If we could catch him, Abd el Khafid would fill
our mouths with gold."</p>

<p>"Perhaps this Feringi knows where to find him!" exclaimed
Shirkuh, his eyes burning with a glitter that might have been
avarice. "I will go to him and swear to deliver his message, and so
trick him into telling me what he knows of El Borak."</p>

<p>"It is all one to me," answered Muhammad indifferently. "If I
had wished to know why he came into the hills, I would have
tortured it out of him before now. But my orders were merely to
capture him and bring him alive to Rub el Harami. I could not turn
aside, not even to capture El Borak. But if you are admitted into
the city, perhaps Abd el Khafid will give you a troop to go hunting
El Borak."</p>

<p>"I will try!"</p>

<p>"Allah grant you luck," said Muhammad. "El Borak is a dog. I
would myself give a thousand rupees to see him hanging in the
market place."</p>

<p>"If it be the will of Allah, you shall meet El Borak!" said
Shirkuh, turning away.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was the play of the firelight on his face which
caused his eyes to burn as they did, but Muhammad felt a curious
chill play down his spine, though he could not reason why.</p>

<p>Shirkuh's booted feet crunched away through the shale, and a
furtive, ragged shadow came out of the night and squatted at
Muhammad's elbow.</p>

<p>"I spied on the Kurd and the infidel as you ordered," muttered
the spy. "The Feringi offered Shirkuh thirty thousand rupees either
to seek out El Borak and deliver a message to him, or to aid him to
escape us. Shirkuh lusted for the gold, but he has been outlawed by
all the Feringis, and he dares not close the one door open to
him."</p>

<p>"Good," growled Muhammad in his beard. "Kurds are dogs; it is
well that this one is in no position to bite. I will speak for him
at the pass. He does not guess the choice that awaits him at the
gates of Rub el Harami."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Brent was sunk in the dreamless slumber of exhaustion, despite
the hardness of the rocky ground and the chill of the night. An
urgent hand shook him awake, an urgent whisper checked his startled
exclamation. He saw a vague shape bending over him, and heard the
snoring of his guard a few feet away. Guarding a man bound and
fettered was more or less of a formality of routine. Shirkuh's
voice hissed in Brent's ear.</p>

<p>"Tell me the message you wished to send El Borak! Be swift,
before the guard awakes. I could not take the message when we
talked before, for there was a cursed spy listening behind that
rock. I told Muhammad what passed between us, because I knew the
spy would tell him anyway, and I wished to disarm suspicion before
it took root. Tell me the word!"</p>

<p>Brent accepted the desperate gamble.</p>

<p>"Tell him that Richard Stockton died, but before he died, he
said this: 'The Black Tigers have a new prince; they call him Abd
el Khafid, but his real name is Vladimir Jakrovitch.' This man
dwells in Rub el Harami, Stockton told me."</p>

<p>"I understand," muttered Shirkuh. "El Borak shall know."</p>

<p>"But what of me?" urged Brent.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you escape now," muttered Shirkuh. "There are too
many of them. All the guards are not asleep. Armed men patrol the
outskirts of the camp, and others watch the horses&mdash;my own
among them."</p>

<p>"I cannot pay you unless I get away!" argued Brent.</p>

<p>"That is in the lap of Allah!" hissed Shirkuh. "I must slip back
to my blankets now, before I am missed. Here is a cloak against the
chill of the night."</p>

<p>Brent felt himself enveloped in a grateful warmth, and then
Shirkuh was gone, gliding away in the night with boots that made no
more noise than the moccasins of a red Indian. Brent lay wondering
if he had done the right thing. There was no reason why he should
trust Shirkuh. But if he had done no good, at least he could not
see that he had done any harm, either to himself, El Borak, or
those interests menaced by the mysterious Black Tigers. He was a
drowning man, clutching at straws. At last he went to sleep again,
lulled by the delicious warmth of the cloak Shirkuh had thrown over
him, and hoping that he would slip away in the night and ride to
find Gordon&mdash;wherever he might be wandering.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife3" name="knife3">III. &mdash; SHIRKUH'S JEST</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was Shirkuh, however, who brought the
American's breakfast to him the next morning. Shirkuh made no sign
either of friendship or enmity, beyond a gruff admonition to eat
heartily, as he did not wish to buy a skinny slave. But that might
have been for the benefit of the guard yawning and stretching near
by. Brent reflected that the cloak was sure evidence that Shirkuh
had visited him in the night, but no one appeared to notice it.</p>

<p>As he ate, grateful at least for the good food, Brent was torn
between doubts and hopes. He swung between halfhearted trust and
complete mistrust of the man. Kurds were bred in deception and cut
their teeth on treachery. Why should that offer of help not have
been a trick to curry favor with Muhammad ez Zahir? Yet Brent
realized that if Muhammad had wished to learn the reason for his
presence in the hills, the Afghan would have been more likely to
resort to torture than an elaborate deception. Then Shirkuh, like
all Kurds, must be avaricious, and that was Brent's best chance.
And if Shirkuh delivered the message, he must go further and help
Brent to escape, in order to get his reward, for Brent, a slave in
Rub el Harami, could not pay him thirty thousand rupees. One
service necessitated the other, if Shirkuh hoped to profit by the
deal. Then there was El Borak; if he got the message, he would
learn of Brent's plight, and he would hardly fail to aid a fellow
Feringi in adversity. It all depended now on Shirkuh.</p>

<p>Brent stared intently at the supple rider, etched against the
sharp dawn. There was nothing of the Turanian or the Semite in
Shirkuh's features. In the Iranian highlands there must be many
clans who kept their ancient Aryan lineage pure. Shirkuh, in
European garments, and without that Oriental mustache, would pass
unnoticed in any Western crowd, but for that primordial blaze in
his restless black eyes. They reflected an untamable soul. How
could he expect this barbarian to deal with him according to the
standards of the Western world?</p>

<p>They were pressing on before sunup, and their trail always led
up now, higher and higher, through knife cuts in solid masses of
towering sandstone, and along narrow paths that wound up and up
interminably, until Brent was gasping again with the rarefied air
of the high places. At high noon, when the wind was knife-edged
with ice, and the sun was a splash of molten fire, they reached the
Pass of Nadir Khan&mdash;a narrow cut winding tortuously for a mile
between turrets of dull colored rock. A squat mud-and-stone tower
stood in the mouth, occupied by ragged warriors squatting on their
aerie like vultures. The troop halted until Muhammad ez Zahir was
recognized. He vouched for the cavalcade, Shirkuh included, with a
wave of his hand, and the rifles on the tower were lowered.
Muhammad rode on into the pass, the others filing after him. Brent
felt despairingly as if one prison door had already slammed behind
him.</p>

<p>They halted for the midday meal in the corridor of the pass,
shaded from the sun and sheltered from the wind. Again Shirkuh
brought food to Brent, without comment or objection from the
Afghans. But when Brent tried to catch his eye, he avoided the
American's gaze.</p>

<p>After they left the pass, the road pitched down in long curving
sweeps, through successively lower mountains that ran away and away
like gigantic stairsteps from the crest of the range. The trail
grew plainer, more traveled, but night found them still among the
hills.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>When Shirkuh brought food to Brent that night as usual, the
American tried to engage him in conversation, under cover of casual
talk for the benefit of the Afghan detailed to guard the American
that night, who lolled near by, bolting chupatties.</p>

<p>"Is Rub el Harami a large city?" Brent asked.</p>

<p>"I have never been there," returned Shirkuh, rather shortly.</p>

<p>"Is Abd el Khafid the ruler?" persisted Brent.</p>

<p>"He is emir of Rub el Harami," said Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"And prince of the Black Tigers," spoke up the Afghan guard
unexpectedly. He was in a garrulous mood, and he saw no reason for
secrecy. One of his hearers would soon be a slave in Rub el Harami,
the other, if accepted, a member of the clan.</p>

<p>"I am myself a Black Tiger," the guard boasted. "All in this
troop are Black Tigers, and picked men. We are the lords of Rub el
Harami."</p>

<p>"Then all in the city are not Black Tigers?" asked Brent.</p>

<p>"All are thieves. Only thieves live in Rub el Harami. But not
all are Black Tigers. But it is the headquarters of the clan, and
the prince of the Black Tigers is always emir of Rub el
Harami."</p>

<p>"Who ordered my capture?" inquired Brent. "Muhammad ez
Zahir?"</p>

<p>"Muhammad only does as he is ordered," returned the guard. "None
gives orders in Rub el Harami save Abd el Khafid. He is absolute
lord save where the customs of the city are involved. Not even the
prince of the Black Tigers can change the customs of Rub el Harami.
It was a city of thieves before the days of Genghis Khan. What its
name was first, none knows; the Arabs call it Rub el Harami, the
Abode of Thieves, and the name has stuck."</p>

<p>"It is an outlaw city?"</p>

<p>"It has never owned a lord save the prince of the Black Tigers,"
boasted the guard. "It pays no taxes to any save him&mdash;and to
Shaitan."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, to Shaitan?" demanded Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"It is an ancient custom," answered the guard. "Each year a
hundredweight of gold is given as an offering to Shaitan, so the
city shall prosper. It is sealed in a secret cave somewhere near
the city, but where no man knows, save the prince and the council
of imams."</p>

<p>"Devil worship!" snorted Shirkuh. "It is an offense to
Allah!"</p>

<p>"It is an ancient custom," defended the guard.</p>

<p>Shirkuh strode off, as if scandalized, and Brent lapsed into
disappointed silence. He wrapped himself in Shirkuh's cloak as well
as he could and slept.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>They were up before dawn and pushing through the hills until
they breasted a sweeping wall, down which the trail wound, and saw
a rocky plain set in the midst of bare mountain chains, and the
flat-topped towers of Rub el Harami rising before them.</p>

<p>They had not halted for the midday meal. As they neared the
city, the trail became a well-traveled road. They overtook or met
men on horses, men walking and driving laden mules. Brent
remembered that it had been said that only stolen goods entered Rub
el Harami. Its inhabitants were the scum of the hills, and the men
they encountered looked it. Brent found himself comparing them with
Shirkuh. The man was a wild outlaw, who boasted of his bloody
crimes, but he was a clean-cut barbarian. He differed from these as
a gray wolf differs from mangy alley curs.</p>

<p>He eyed all they met or passed with a gaze half naive, half
challenging. He was boyishly interested; he was ready to fight at
the flick of a turban end, and gave the road to no man. He was the
youth of the world incarnated, credulous, merry, hot-headed,
generous, cruel, and arrogant. And Brent knew his life hung on the
young savage's changing whims.</p>

<p>Rub el Harami was a walled city standing in the narrow
rock-strewn plain hemmed in by bare hills. A battery of field
pieces could have knocked down its walls with a dozen
volleys&mdash;but the army never marched that could have dragged
field pieces over the road that led to it through the Pass of Nadir
Khan. Its gray walls loomed bleakly above the gray dusty waste of
the small plain. A chill wind from the northern peaks brought a
tang of snow and started the dust spinning. Well curbs rose gauntly
here and there on the plain, and near each well stood a cluster of
squalid huts. Peasants in rags bent their backs over sterile
patches that yielded grudging crops&mdash;mere smudges on the dusty
expanse. The low-hanging sun turned the dust to a bloody haze in
the air, as the troop with its prisoner trudged on weary horses
across the plain to the gaunt city.</p>

<p>Beneath a lowering arch, flanked by squat watchtowers, an
iron-bolted gate stood open, guarded by a dozen swashbucklers whose
girdles bristled with daggers. They clicked the bolts of their
German rifles and stared arrogantly about them, as if itching to
practice on some living target.</p>

<p>The troop halted, and the captain of the guard swaggered forth,
a giant with bulging muscles and a henna-stained beard.</p>

<p>"Thy names and business!" he roared, glaring intolerantly at
Brent.</p>

<p>"My name you know as well as you know your own," growled
Muhammad ez Zahir. "I am taking a prisoner into the city, by order
of Abd el Khafid."</p>

<p>"Pass, Muhammad ez Zahir," growled the captain. "But who is this
Kurd?"</p>

<p>Muhammad grinned wolfishly, as if at a secret jest.</p>

<p>"An adventurer who seeks admission&mdash;Shirkuh, of the Jebel
Jawur."</p>

<p>While they were speaking, a richly clad, powerfully built man on
a white mare rode out of the gate and halted, unnoticed, behind the
guardsmen. The henna-bearded captain turned toward Shirkuh who had
dismounted to get a pebble out of his stallion's hoof.</p>

<p>"Are you one of the clan?" he demanded. "Do you know the secret
signs?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet been accepted," answered Shirkuh, turning to
face him. "Men tell me I must be passed upon by the council of
imams."</p>

<p>"Aye, if you reach them! Does any chief of the city speak for
you?"</p>

<p>"I am a stranger," replied Shirkuh shortly.</p>

<p>"We like not strangers in Rub el Harami," said the captain.
"There are but three ways a stranger may enter the city. As a
captive, like that infidel dog yonder; as one vouched for and
indorsed by some established chief of the city; or"&mdash;he showed
yellow fangs in an evil grin&mdash;"as the slayer of some fighting
man of the city!"</p>

<p>He shifted the rifle to his right hand and slapped the butt with
his left palm. Sardonic laughter rose about them, the dry,
strident, cruel cackling of the hills. Those who laughed knew that
in any kind of fight between a stranger and a man of the city every
foul advantage would be taken. For a stranger to be forced into a
formal duel with a Black Tiger was tantamount to signing his death
warrant. Brent, rigid with sudden concern, guessed this from the
vicious laughter.</p>

<p>But Shirkuh did not seem abashed.</p>

<p>"It is an ancient custom?" he asked naively, dropping a hand to
his girdle.</p>

<p>"Ancient as Islam!" assured the giant captain, towering above
him. "A tried warrior, with weapons in his hands, thou must
slay!"</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shirkuh laughed, and as he laughed, he struck. His motion was as
quick as the blurring stroke of a cobra. In one movement he whipped
the dagger from his girdle and struck upward under the captain's
bearded chin. The Afghan had no opportunity to defend himself, no
chance to lift rifle or draw sword. Before he realized Shirkuh's
intention, he was down, his life gushing out of his sliced
jugular.</p>

<p>An instant of stunned silence was broken by wild yells of
laughter from the lookers-on and the men of the troop. It was just
such a devilish jest as the bloodthirsty hill natures appreciated.
There is humor in the hills, but it is a fiendish humor. The
strange youth had shown a glint of the hard wolfish sophistication
that underlay his apparent callowness.</p>

<p>But the other guardsmen cried out angrily and surged forward,
with a sharp rattle of rifle bolts. Shirkuh sprang back and tore
his rifle from its saddle scabbard. Muhammad and his men looked on
cynically. It was none of their affair. They had enjoyed Shirkuh's
grim and bitter jest; they would equally enjoy the sight of him
being shot down by his victim's comrades.</p>

<p>But before a finger could crook on a trigger, the man on the
white mare rode forward, beating down the rifles of the guards with
a riding whip.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded. "The Kurd is in the right. He slew
according to the law. The man's weapons were in his hands, and he
was a tried warrior."</p>

<p>"But he was taken unaware!" they clamored.</p>

<p>"The more fool he!" was the callous retort. "The law makes no
point of that. I speak for the Kurd. And I am Alafdal Khan, once of
Waziristan."</p>

<p>"Nay, we know you, my lord!" The guardsmen salaamed
profoundly.</p>

<p>Muhammad ez Zahir gathered up his reins and spoke to
Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"You luck still holds, Kurd!"</p>

<p>"Allah loves brave men!" Shirkuh laughed, swinging into the
saddle.</p>

<p>Muhammad ez Zahir rode under the arch, and the troop streamed
after him, their captive in their midst. They traversed a short
narrow street, winding between walls of mud and wood, where
overhanging balconies almost touched each other over the crooked
way. Brent saw women staring at them through the lattices. The
cavalcade emerged into a square much like that of any other hill
town, Open shops and stalls lined it, and it was thronged by a
colorful crowd. But there was a difference. The crowd was too
heterogeneous, for one thing; then there was too much wealth in
sight. The town was prosperous, but with a sinister, unnatural
prosperity. Gold and silk gleamed on barefooted ruffians whose
proper garb was rags, and the goods displayed in the shops seemed
mute evidence of murder and pillage. This was in truth a city of
thieves.</p>

<p>The throng was lawless and turbulent, its temper set on a hair
trigger. There were human skulls nailed above the gate, and in an
iron cage made fast to the wall Brent saw a human skeleton.
Vultures perched on the bars. Brent felt cold sweat bead his flesh.
That might well be his own fate&mdash;to starve slowly in an iron
cage hung above the heads of the jeering crowd. A sick abhorrence
and a fierce hatred of this vile city swept over him.</p>

<p>As they rode into the city, Alafdal Khan drew his mare alongside
Shirkuh's stallion. The Waziri was a bull-shouldered man with a
bushy purple- stained beard and wide, ox-like eyes.</p>

<p>"I like you, Kurd," he announced. "You are in truth a mountain
lion. Take service with me. A masterless man is a broken blade in
Rub el Harami."</p>

<p>"I thought Abd el Khafid was master of Rub el Harami," said
Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"Aye! But the city is divided into factions, and each man who is
wise follows one chief or the other. Only picked men with long
years of service behind them are chosen for Abd el Khafid's house
troops. The others follow various lords, who are each responsible
to the emir."</p>

<p>"I am my own man!" boasted Shirkuh. "But you spoke for me at the
gate. What devil's custom is this, when a stranger must kill a man
to enter?"</p>

<p>"In old times it was meant to test a stranger's valor, and make
sure that each man who came into Rub el Harami was a tried
warrior," said Alafdal. "For generations, however, it has become
merely an excuse to murder strangers. Few come uninvited. You
should have secured the patronage of some chief of the clan before
you came. Then you could have entered the city peacefully."</p>

<p>"I knew no man in the clan," muttered Shirkuh. "There are no
Black Tigers in the Jebel Jawur. But men say the clan is coming to
life, after slumbering in idleness for a hundred years,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A disturbance in the crowd ahead of them interrupted him. The
people in the square had massed thickly about the troop, slowing
their progress, and growling ominously at the sight of Brent.
Curses were howled, and bits of offal and refuse thrown, and now a
scarred Shinwari stooped and caught up a stone which he cast at the
white man. The missile grazed Brent's ear, drawing blood, and with
a curse Shirkuh drove his horse against the fellow, knocking him
down. A deep roar rose from the mob, and it surged forward
menacingly. Shirkuh dragged his rifle from under his knee, but
Alafdal Khan caught his arm</p>

<p>"Nay, brother! Do not fire. Leave these dogs to me."</p>

<p>He lifted his voice in a bull's bellow which carried across the
square.</p>

<p>"Peace, my children! This is Shirkuh, of Jebel Jawur, who has
come to be one of us. I speak for him&mdash;I, Alafdal Khan!"</p>

<p>A cheer rose from the crowd whose spirit was as vagrant and
changeable as a leaf tossed in the wind. Obviously the Waziri was
popular in Rub el Harami, and Brent guessed why as he saw Alafdal
thrust a hand into a money pouch he carried at his girdle. But
before the chief could completely mollify the mob by flinging a
handful of coins among them, another figure entered the central
drama. It was a Ghilzai who reined his horse through the
crowd&mdash;a slim man, but tall and broad-shouldered, and one who
looked as though his frame were of woven steel wires. He wore a
rose-colored turban; a rich girdle clasped his supple waist, and
his caftan was embroidered with gilt thread. A clump of ruffians on
horseback followed him.</p>

<p>He drew rein in front of Alafdal Khan, whose beard instantly
bristled while his wide eyes dilated truculently. Shirkuh quietly
exchanged his rifle for his saber.</p>

<p>"That is my man your Kurd rode down," said the Ghilzai,
indicating the groaning ruffian now dragging his bleeding hulk
away. "Do you set your men on mine in the streets, Alafdal
Khan?"</p>

<p>The people fell tensely silent, their own passions forgotten in
the rivalry of the chiefs. Even Brent could tell that this was no
new antagonism, but the rankling of an old quarrel. The Ghilzai was
alert, sneering, coldly provocative. Alafdal Khan was belligerent,
angry, yet uneasy.</p>

<p>"Your man began it, Ali Shah," he growled. "Stand aside. We take
a prisoner to the Adobe of the Damned."</p>

<p>Brent sensed that Alafdal Khan was avoiding the issue. Yet he
did not lack followers. Hard-eyed men with weapons in their
girdles, some on foot, some on horseback, pushed through the throng
and ranged themselves behind the Waziri. It was not physical
courage Alafdal lacked, but some fiber of decision.</p>

<p>At Alafdal's declaration, which placed him in the position of
one engaged in the emir's business, and therefore not to be
interfered with&mdash;a statement at which Muhammad ez Zahir smiled
cynically&mdash;Ali Shah hesitated, and the tense instant might
have smoldered out, had it not been for one of the Ghilzai's
men&mdash;a lean Orakzai, with hashish madness in his eyes.
Standing in the edge of the crowd, he rested a rifle over the
shoulder of the man in front of him and fired point-blank at the
Waziri chief. Only the convulsive start of the owner of the
shoulder saved Alafdal Khan. The bullet tore a piece out of his
turban, and before the Orakzai could fire again, Shirkuh rode at
him and cut him down with a stroke that split his head to the
teeth.</p>

<p>It was like throwing a lighted match into a powder mill. In an
instant the square was a seething battle ground, where the
adherents of the rival chiefs leaped at each others' throats with
all the zeal ordinary men generally display in fighting somebody
else's battle. Muhammad ez Zahir, unable to force his way through
the heaving mass, stolidly drew his troopers in a solid ring around
his prisoner. He had not interfered when the stones were cast.
Stones would not kill the Feringi, and he was concerned only in
getting Brent to his master alive and able to talk. He did not care
how bloody and battered he might be. But in this melee a chance
stroke might kill the infidel. His men faced outward, beating off
attempts to get at their prisoner. Otherwise they took no part in
the fighting. This brawl between rival chiefs, common enough in Rub
el Harami, was none of Muhammad's affair.</p>

<p>Brent watched fascinated. But for modern weapons it might have
been a riot in ancient Babylon, Cairo, or Nineveh&mdash;the same
old jealousies, same old passions, same old instinct of the common
man fiercely to take up some lordling's quarrel. He saw gaudily
clad horsemen curvetting and caracoling as they slashed at each
other with tulwars that were arcs of fire in the setting sun, and
he saw ragged rascals belaboring each other with staves and
cobblestones. No more shots were fired; it seemed an unwritten law
that firearms were not to be used in street fighting. Or perhaps
ammunition was too precious for them to waste on each other.</p>

<p>But it was bloody enough while it lasted, and it littered the
square with stunned and bleeding figures. Men with broken heads
went down under the stamping hoofs, and some of them did not get up
again. Ali Shah's retainers outnumbered Alafdal Khan's, but the
majority of the crowd were for the Waziri, as evidenced by the
fragments of stone and wood that whizzed about the ears of his
enemies. One of these well-meant missiles almost proved their
champion's undoing. It was a potsherd, hurled with more zeal than
accuracy at Ali Shah. It missed him and crashed full against
Alafdal's bearded chin with an impact that filled the Waziri's eyes
with tears and stars.</p>

<p>As he reeled in his saddle, his sword arm sinking, Ali Shah
spurred at him, lifting his tulwar. There was murder in the air,
while the blinded giant groped dazedly, sensing his peril. But
Shirkuh was between them, lunging through the crowd like a driven
bolt. He caught the swinging tulwar on his saber, and struck back,
rising in his stirrups to add force to the blow. His blade struck
flat, but it broke the left arm Ali Shah threw up in desperation,
and beat down on the Ghilzai's turban with a fury that stretched
the chief bleeding and senseless on the trampled cobblestones.</p>

<p>A gratified yell went up from the crowd, and Ali Shah's men fell
back, confused and intimidated. Then there rose a thunder of hoofs,
and a troop of men in compact formation swept the crowd to right
and left as they plunged ruthlessly through. They were tall men in
black chain armor and spired helmets, and their leader was a
black-bearded Yusufzai, resplendent in gold-chased steel.</p>

<p>"Give way!" he ordered, with the hard arrogance of authority.
"Clear the <i>suk</i>, in the name of Abd el Khafid, emir of Rub el
Harami!"</p>

<p>"The Black Tigers!" muttered the people, giving back, but
watching Alafdal Khan expectantly.</p>

<p>For an instant it seemed that the Waziri would defy the riders.
His beard bristled, his eyes dilated&mdash;then he wavered,
shrugged his giant shoulders, and sheathed his tulwar.</p>

<p>"Obey the law, my children," he advised them, and, not to be
cheated out of the gesture he loved, he reached into his bulging
pouch and sent a golden shower over their heads.</p>

<p>They went scrambling after the coins, shouting, and cheering,
and laughing, and somebody yelled audaciously:</p>

<p>"Hail, Alafdal Khan, emir of Rub el Harami!"</p>

<p>Alafdal's countenance was an almost comical mingling of vanity
and apprehension. He eyed the Yusufzai captain sidewise half
triumphantly, half uneasily, tugging at his purple beard. The
captain said crisply:</p>

<p>"Let there be an end to this nonsense. Alafdal Khan, the emir
will hold you to account if any more fighting occurs. He is weary
of this quarrel."</p>

<p>"Ali Shah started it!" roared the Waziri heatedly.</p>

<p>The crowd rumbled menacingly behind him, stooping furtively for
stones and sticks. Again that half-exultant, half-frightened look
flitted across Alafdal's broad face. The Yusufzai laughed
sardonically.</p>

<p>"Too much popularity in the streets may cost a man his head in
the palace!" said he, and turning away, he began clearing the
square.</p>

<p>The mob fell back sullenly, growling in their beards, not
exactly flinching from the prodding lances of the riders, but
retiring grudgingly and with menace in their bearing. Brent
believed that all they needed to rise in bloody revolt was a
determined leader. Ali Shah's men picked up their senseless chief
and lifted him into his saddle; they moved off across the
<i>suk</i> with the leader lolling drunkenly in their midst. The
fallen men who were able to stand were hustled to their feet by the
Black Tigers.</p>

<p>Alafdal glared after them in a curiously helpless anger, his
hand in his purple beard. Then he rumbled like a bear and rode off
with his men, the wounded ones swaying on the saddles of their
companions. Shirkuh rode with him, and as he reined away, he shot a
glance at Brent which the American hoped meant that he was not
deserting him.</p>

<p>Muhammad ez Zahir led his men and captive out of the square and
down a winding street, cackling sardonically in his beard as he
went.</p>

<p>"Alafdal Khan is ambitious and fearful, which is a sorry
combination. He hates Ali Shah, yet avoids bringing the feud to a
climax. He would like to be emir of Rub el Harami, but he doubts
his own strength. He will never do anything but guzzle wine and
throw money to the multitude. The fool! Yet he fights like a hungry
bear once he is roused."</p>

<p>A trooper nudged Brent and pointed ahead of them to a squat
building with iron-barred windows.</p>

<p>"The Abode of the Damned, Feringi!" he said maliciously. "No
prisoner ever escaped therefrom&mdash;and none ever spent more than
one night there."</p>

<p>At the door Muhammad gave his captive in charge of a one-eyed
Sudozai with a squad of brutal-looking blacks armed with whips and
bludgeons. These led him up a dimly lighted corridor to a cell with
a barred door. Into this they thrust him. They placed on the floor
a vessel of scummy water and a flat loaf of moldy bread, and then
filed out. The key turned in the lock with a chillingly final
sound.</p>

<p>A few last rays of the sunset's afterglow found their way
through the tiny, high, thick-barred window. Brent ate and drank
mechanically, a prey to sick forebodings. All his future hinged now
on Shirkuh, and Brent felt it was a chance as thin as a sword edge.
Stiffly he stretched himself on the musty straw heaped in one
corner. As he sank to sleep, he wondered dimly if there had ever
really been a trim, exquisitely tailored person named Stuart Brent
who slept in a soft bed and drank iced drinks out of slim-stemmed
glasses, and danced with pink-and-white visions of feminine
loveliness under tinted electric lights. It was a far-off dream;
this was reality&mdash;rotten straw that crawled with vermin,
smelly water and stale bread, and the scent of spilled blood that
still seemed to cling to his garments after the fight in the
square.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife4" name="knife4">IV. &mdash; CROOKED PATHS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BRENT awoke with the light of a torch dazzling his
eyes. This torch was placed in a socket in the wall, and when his
eyes became accustomed to the wavering glare, he saw a tall,
powerful man in a long satin caftan and a green turban with a gold
brooch. From beneath this turban, wide gray eyes, as cold as a
sword of ice, regarded him contemplatively.</p>

<p>"You are Stuart Brent."</p>

<p>It was a statement, not a question. The man spoke English with
only a hint of an accent; but that hint was unmistakable. Brent
made no reply. This was Abd el Khafid, of course, but it was like
meeting a character of fable clothed in flesh. Abd el Khafid and El
Borak had begun to take on the appearance in Brent's worn brain of
symbolic will-o'-the-wisps, nonexistent twin phantoms luring him to
his doom. But here stood half of that phantasm, living and
speaking. Perhaps El Borak was equally real, after all.</p>

<p>Brent studied the man almost impersonally. He looked Oriental
enough in that garb, with his black pointed beard. But his hands
were too big for a high- caste Moslem's hands&mdash;sinewy,
ruthless hands that looked as if they could grasp either a sword
hilt or a scepter. The body under the caftan appeared hard and
capable&mdash;not with the tigerish suppleness of Shirkuh, but
strong and quick, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"My spies watched you all the way from San Francisco," said Abd
el Khafid. "They knew when you bought a steamship ticket to India.
Their reports were wired by relays to Kabul&mdash;I have my secret
wireless sets and spies in every capital of Asia&mdash;and thence
here. I have my wireless set hidden back in the hills, here.
Inconvenient, but the people would not stand for it in the city. It
was a violation of custom. Rub el Harami rests on a foundation of
customs&mdash;irksome at times, but mostly useful.</p>

<p>"I knew you would not have immediately sailed for India had not
Richard Stockton told you something before he died, and I thought
at first of having you killed as soon as you stepped off the ship.
Then I decided to wait a bit and try to learn just how much you
knew before I had you removed. Spies sent me word that you were
coming North&mdash;that apparently you had told the British only
that you wished to find El Borak. I knew then that Stockton had
told you to find El Borak and tell him my true identity. Stockton
was a human bloodhound, but it was only through the indiscretion of
a servant that he learned the secret.</p>

<p>"Stockton knew that the only man who could harm me was El Borak.
I am safe from the English here, safe from the ameer. El Borak
could cause me trouble, if he suspected my true identity. As it is,
so long as he considers me merely Abd el Khafid, a Moslem fanatic
from Samarkand, he will not interfere. But if he should learn who I
really am, he would guess why I am here, and what I am doing.</p>

<p>"So I let you come up the Khyber unmolested. It was evident by
this time that you intended giving the news directly to El Borak,
and my spies told me El Borak had vanished in the hills. I knew
when you left Kabul, searching for him, and I sent Muhammad ez
Zahir to capture and bring you here. You were easy to trace&mdash;a
<i>Melakani</i> wandering in the hills with a band of Kabuli
soldiery. So you entered Rub el Harami at last the only way an
infidel may enter&mdash;as a captive, destined for the slave
block."</p>

<p>"You are an infidel," retorted Brent. "If I expose your true
identity to these people&mdash;"</p>

<p>The strong shoulders under the caftan shrugged.</p>

<p>"The imams know I was born a Russian. They know likewise that I
am a true Moslem&mdash;that I foreswore Christianity and publicly
acknowledged Islam, years ago. I cut all ties that bound me to
<i>Feringistan</i>. My name is Abd el Khafid. I have a right to
wear this green turban. I am a hadji. I have made the pilgrimage to
Mecca. Tell the people of Rub el Harami that I am a Christian. They
will laugh at you. To the masses I am a Moslem like themselves; to
the council of imams I am a true convert."</p>

<p>Brent said nothing; he was in a trap he could not break.</p>

<p>"You are but a fly in my web," said Abd el Khafid
contemptuously. "So unimportant that I intend to tell you my full
purpose. It is good practice speaking in English. Sometimes I
almost forget European tongues.</p>

<p>"The Black Tigers compose a very ancient society. It originally
grew out of the bodyguard of Genghis Khan. After his death they
settled in Rub el Harami, even then an outlaw city, and became the
ruling caste. It expanded into a secret society, always with its
headquarters here in this city. It soon became Moslem, a clan of
fanatical haters of the Feringi, and the emirs sold the swords of
their followers to many leaders of jihad, the holy war.</p>

<p>"It flourished, then decayed. A hundred years ago the clan was
nearly exterminated in a hill feud, and the organization became a
shadow, limited to the rulers and officials of Rub el Harami alone.
But they still held the city. Ten years ago I cut loose from my
people and became a Moslem, heart and soul. In my wanderings I
discovered the Black Tigers, and saw their potentialities. I
journeyed to Rub el Harami, and here I stumbled upon a secret that
set my brain on fire.</p>

<p>"But I run ahead of my tale. It was only three years ago that I
gained admittance into the clan. It was during the seven years
preceding that, seven years of wandering, fighting, and plotting
all over Asia, that clashed more than once with El Borak, and
learned how dangerous the man was&mdash;and that we must always be
enemies, since our interests and ideals were so antithetical. So
when I came to Rub el Harami, I simply dropped out of sight of El
Borak and all the other adventurers that like him and me rove the
waste places of the East. Before I came to the city, I spent months
in erasing my tracks. Valdimir Jakrovitch, known also as Akbar
Shah, disappeared entirely. Not even El Borak connected him with
Abd el Khafid, wanderer from Samarkand. I had stepped into a
completely new role and personality. If El Borak should see me, he
might suspect&mdash;but he never shall, except as my captive.</p>

<p>"Without interference from him I began to build up the clan,
first as a member of the ranks, from which I swiftly rose, then as
prince of the clan, to which position I attained less than a year
ago, by means and intrigues I shall not inflict upon you. I have
reorganized the society, expanded it as of old, placed my spies in
every country in the world. Of course El Borak must have heard that
the Black Tiger was stirring again; but to him it would mean only
the spasmodic activity of a band of fanatics, without international
significance.</p>

<p>"But he would guess its true meaning if he knew that Abd el
Khafid is the man he fought up and down the length and breadth of
Asia, years ago!" The man's eyes blazed, his voice vibrated. In his
super-egotism he found intense satisfaction in even so small and
hostile an audience as his prisoner. "Did you ever hear of the
Golden Cave of Shaitan el Kabir?</p>

<p>"It lies within a day's ride of the city, so carefully hidden
that an army of men might search for it forever, in vain. But I
have seen it! It is a sight to madden a man&mdash;heaped from floor
to roof with blocks of gold! It is the offerings to Shaitan&mdash;a
custom dating from old heathen days. Each year a hundred-weight of
gold, levied on the people of the city, is melted and molded in
small blocks, and carried and placed in the cave by the imams and
the emir. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that a treasure of that size exists near
this city of thieves?" demanded Brent incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why not? Have you not heard the city's customs are unbending as
iron? Only the imams know the secret of the cave; the knowledge is
handed down from imam to imam, from emir to emir. The people do not
know; they suppose the gold is taken by Shaitan to his infernal
abode. If they knew, they would not touch it. Take gold dedicated
to Shaitan the Damned? You little know the Oriental mind. Not a
Moslem in the world would touch a grain of it, even though he were
starving.</p>

<p>"But I am free of such superstitions. Within a few days the gift
to Shaitan will be placed in the cave. It will be another year then
before the imams visit the cavern again. And before that time comes
around, I will have accomplished my purpose. I will secretly remove
the gold from the cave, working utterly alone, and will melt it
down and recast it in different forms. Oh, I understand the art and
have the proper equipment. When I have finished, none can recognize
it as the accursed gold of Shaitan.</p>

<p>"With it I can feed and equip an army! I can buy rifles,
ammunition, machine guns, airplanes, and mercenaries to fly them. I
can arm every cutthroat in the Himalayas! These hill tribes have
the makings of the finest army in the world&mdash;all they need is
equipment. And that equipment I will supply. There are plenty of
European sources ready to sell me whatever I want. And the gold of
Shaitan will supply my needs!" The man was sweating, his eyes
blazing as if madness like molten gold had entered his veins. "The
world never dreamed of such a treasure-trove! The golden offerings
of a thousand years heaped from floor to ceiling! And it is
<i>mine!</i>"</p>

<p>"The imams will kill you!" whispered Brent, appalled.</p>

<p>"They will not know for nearly a year. I will invent a lie to
explain my great wealth. They will not suspect until they open the
cave next year. Then it will be too late. Then I will be free from
the Black Tigers. I will be an emperor!"</p>

<p>"With my great new army I will sweep down into the plains of
India. I will lead a horde of Afghans, Persians, Pathans, Arabs,
Turkomen that will make up for discipline by numbers and ferocity.
The Indian Moslems will rise! I will sweep the English out of the
land! I will rule supreme from Samarkand to Cape Comorin!"</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this?" asked Brent. "What's to prevent me
from betraying you to the imams?"</p>

<p>"You will never see an imam," was the grim reply. "I will see
that you have no opportunity to talk. But enough of this: I allowed
you to come alive to Rub el Harami only because I wanted to learn
what secret password Stockton gave you to use with the British
officials. I know you had one, by the speed and ease with which you
were passed up to Kabul. I have long sought to get one of my spies
into the very vitals of the secret service. This password will
enable me to do so. Tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Brent laughed sardonically, then. "You're going to kill me
anyway. I certainly don't intend to deprive myself of this one tiny
crumb of retaliation. I'm not going to put another weapon in your
filthy hands."</p>

<p>"You're a fool!" exclaimed Abd el Khafid, with a flash of anger
too sudden, too easily aroused for complete self-confidence. The
man was on edge, and not so sure of himself as he seemed.</p>

<p>"Doubtless," agreed Brent tranquilly. "And what about it?"</p>

<p>"Very well!" Abd el Khafid restrained himself by an obvious
effort. "I cannot touch you tonight. You are the property of the
city, according to age- old custom not even I can ignore. But
tomorrow you will be sold on the block to the highest bidder. No
one wants a Feringi slave, except for the pleasure of torturing.
They are too soft for hard work. I will buy you for a few rupees,
and then there will be nothing to prevent my <i>making</i> you
talk. Before I fling your mangled carcass out on the garbage heap
for the vultures, you will have told me everything I want to
know."</p>

<p>Abruptly he turned and stalked out of the dungeon. Brent heard
his footsteps reecho hollowly on the flags of the corridor. A wisp
of conversation came back faintly. Then a door slammed and there
was nothing but silence and a star blinking dimly through the
barred window.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>In another part of the city Shirkuh lounged on a silken divan,
under the glow of bronze lamps that struck sparkling glints from
the rich wine brimming in golden goblets. Shirkuh drank deep,
smacking his lips, desert-fashion, as a matter of politeness to his
host. He seemed to have no thought in the world except the
quenching of his thirst, but Alafdal Khan, on another couch, knit
his brows in perplexity. He was uncovering astonishing discoveries
in this wild young warrior from the western
mountains&mdash;unsuspected subtleties and hidden depths.</p>

<p>"Why do you wish to buy this <i>Melakani</i>?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He is necessary to us," asserted Shirkuh. With the bronze lamps
throwing his face into half shadow, the boyishness was gone,
replaced by a keen hawk- like hardness and maturity.</p>

<p>"We must have him. I will buy him in the <i>suk</i> tomorrow,
and he will aid us in making you emir of Rub el Harami."</p>

<p>"But you have no money!" expostulated the Waziri.</p>

<p>"You must lend it to me."</p>

<p>"But Abd el Khafid desires him," argued Alafdal Khan. "He sent
Muhammad ez Zahir out to capture him. It would be unwise to bid
against the emir."</p>

<p>Shirkuh emptied his cup before answering.</p>

<p>"From what you have told me of the city," he said presently,
"this is the situation. Only a certain per cent of the citizens are
Black Tigers. They constitute a ruling caste and a sort of police
force to support the emir. The emirs are complete despots, except
when checked by customs whose roots are lost in the mists of
antiquity. They rule with an iron rein over a turbulent and lawless
population, composed of the dregs and scum of Central Asia."</p>

<p>"That is true," agreed Alafdal Khan.</p>

<p>"But in the past, the people have risen and deposed a ruler who
trampled on tradition, forcing the Black Tigers to elevate another
prince. Very well. You have told me that the number of Black Tigers
in the city is comparatively small at present. Many have been sent
as spies or emissaries to other regions. You yourself are high in
the ranks of the clan."</p>

<p>"An empty honor," said Alafdal bitterly. "My advice is never
asked in council. I have no authority except with my own personal
retainers. And they are less than those of Abd el Khafid or Ali
Shah."</p>

<p>"It is upon the crowd in the streets we must rely," replied
Shirkuh. "You are popular with the masses. They are almost ready to
rise under you, were you to declare yourself. But that will come
later. They need a leader and a motive. We will supply both. But
first we must secure the Feringi. With him safe in our hands, we
will plan our next move in the game."</p>

<p>Alafdal Khan scowled, his powerful fingers knotting about the
slender stem of the wineglass. Conflicting emotions of vanity,
ambition, and fear played across his broad face.</p>

<p>"You talk high!" he complained. "You ride into Rub el Harami, a
penniless adventurer, and say you can make me emir of the city! How
do I know you are not an empty bag of wind? How can you make me
prince of Rub el Harami?"</p>

<p>Shirkuh set down his wineglass and rose, folding his arms. He
looked somberly down at the astounded Waziri, all naiveness and
reckless humor gone out of his face. He spoke a single phrase, and
Alafdal ejaculated stranglingly and lurched to his feet, spilling
his wine. He reeled like a drunkard, clutching at the divan, his
dilated eyes searching, with a fierce intensity, the dark, immobile
face before him.</p>

<p>"Do you believe, now, that I can make you emir of Rub el
Harami?" demanded Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"Who could doubt it?" panted Alafdal. "Have you not put kings on
their thrones? But you are mad, to come here! One word to the mob
and they would rend you limb from limb!"</p>

<p>"You will not speak that word," said Shirkuh with conviction.
"You will not throw away the lordship of Rub el Harami."</p>

<p>And Alafdal nodded slowly, the fire of ambition surging redly in
his eyes.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife5" name="knife5">V. &mdash; SWORDS IN THE "SUK"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DAWN streaming grayly through the barred window
awakened Brent. He reflected that it might be the last dawn he
would see as a free man. He laughed wryly at the thought. Free? Yet
at least he was still a captive, not a slave. There was a vast
difference between a captive and a slave&mdash;a revolting gulf, in
which, crossing, a man or woman's self-respect must be forever
lost.</p>

<p>Presently black slaves came with a jug of cheap sour wine, and
food&mdash;chupatties, rice cakes, dried dates. Royal fare compared
with his supper the night before. A Tajik barber shaved him and
trimmed his hair, and he was allowed the luxury of scrubbing
himself pink in the prison bath.</p>

<p>He was grateful for the opportunity, but the whole proceeding
was disgusting. He felt like a prize animal being curried and
groomed for display. Some whim prompted him to ask the barber where
the proceeds of his sale would go, and the man answered into the
city treasury, to keep the walls repaired. A singularly unromantic
usage for the price of a human being, but typical of the hard
practicality of the East. Brent thought fleetingly of Shirkuh, then
shrugged his shoulders. Apparently the Kurd had abandoned him to
his fate.</p>

<p>Clad only in a loin cloth and sandals, he was led from the
prison by the one-eyed Sudozai and a huge black slave. Horses were
waiting for them at the gate, and he was ordered to mount. Between
the slave masters he clattered up the street before the sun was up.
But already the crowd was gathering in the square. The auctioning
of a white man was an event, and there was, furthermore, a feeling
of expectancy in the air, sharpened by the fight of the day
before.</p>

<p>In the midst of the square there stood a thick platform built
solidly of stone blocks; it was perhaps four feet high and thirty
feet across. On this platform the Sudozai took his stand, grasping
a piece of rope which was tied loosely about Brent's neck. Behind
them stood the stolid Soudanese with a drawn scimitar on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Before, and to one side of the block the crowd had left a space
clear, and there Abd el Khafid sat his horse, amid a troop of Black
Tigers, bizarre in their ceremonial armor. Ceremonial it must be,
reflected Brent; it might turn a sword blade, but it would afford
no protection against a bullet. But it was one of the many
fantastic customs of the city, where tradition took the place of
written law. The bodyguard of the emir had always worn black armor.
Therefore, they would always wear it. Muhammad ez Zahir commanded
them. Brent did not see Ali Shah.</p>

<p>Another custom was responsible for the presence of Abd el
Khafid, instead of sending a servant to buy the American for him;
not even the emir could bid by proxy.</p>

<p>As he climbed upon the block, Brent heard a cheer, and saw
Alafdal Khan and Shirkuh pushing through the throng on their
horses. Behind them came thirty- five warriors, well armed and well
mounted. The Waziri chief was plainly nervous, but Shirkuh strutted
like a peacock, even on horseback, before the admiring gaze of the
throng.</p>

<p>At the ringing ovation given them, annoyance flitted across Abd
el Khafid's broad, pale face, and that expression was followed by a
more sinister darkening that boded ill for the Waziri and his
ally.</p>

<p>The auction began abruptly and undramatically. The Sudozai began
in a singsong voice to narrate the desirable physical points of the
prisoner, when Abd el Khafid cut him short and offered fifty
rupees.</p>

<p>"A hundred!" instantly yelled Shirkuh.</p>

<p>Abd el Khafid turned an irritated and menacing glare on him.
Shirkuh grinned insolently, and the crowd hugged itself, sensing a
conflict of the sort it loved.</p>

<p>"Three hundred!" snarled the emir, meaning to squelch this
irreverent vagabond without delay.</p>

<p>"Four hundred!" shouted Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"A thousand!" cried Adb el Khafid in a passion.</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred!"</p>

<p>And Shirkuh deliberately laughed in the emir's face, and the
crowd laughed with him. Abd el Khafid appeared at a disadvantage,
for he was a bit confused at this unexpected opposition, and had
lost his temper too easily. The fierce eyes of the crowd missed
nothing of this, for it is on such points the wolf pack ceaselessly
and pitilessly judges its leader. Their sympathies swung to the
laughing, youthful stranger, sitting his horse with careless
ease.</p>

<p>Brent's heart had leaped into his throat at the first sound of
Shirkuh's voice. If the man meant to aid him, this was the most
obvious way to take. Then his heart sank again at the determination
in Abd el Khafid's angry face. The emir would never let his captive
slip between his fingers. And though the Gift of Shaitan was not
yet in the Russian's possession, yet doubtless his private
resources were too great for Shirkuh. In a contest of finances
Shirkuh was foredoomed to lose.</p>

<p>Brent's conclusions were not those of Abd el Khafid. The emir
shot a glance at Alafdal Khan, shifting uneasily in his saddle. He
saw the beads of moisture gathered on the Waziri's broad brow, and
realized a collusion between the men. New anger blazed in the
emir's eyes.</p>

<p>In his way Abd el Khafid was miserly. He was willing to squander
gold like water on a main objective, but it irked him exceedingly
to pay an exorbitant price to attain a minor goal. He
knew&mdash;every man in the crowd knew now&mdash;that Alafdal Khan
was backing Shirkuh. And all men knew that the Waziri was one of
the wealthiest men in the city, and a prodigal spender. Abd el
Khafid's nostrils pinched in with wrath as he realized the heights
of extravagance to which he might be forced, did Shirkuh persist in
this impertinent opposition to his wishes. The Gift of Shaitan was
not yet in his hands, and his private funds were drained constantly
by the expenses of his spy system and his various intrigues. He
raised the bid in a harsh, anger-edged voice.</p>

<p>Brent, studying the drama with the keen, understanding eyes of a
gambler, realized that Abd el Khafid had got off on the wrong foot.
Shirkuh's bearing appealed to the crowd. They laughed at his
sallies, which were salty and sparkling with all the age-old
ribaldry of the East, and they hissed covertly at the emir, under
cover of their neighbors.</p>

<p>The bidding mounted to unexpected heights. Abd el Khafid, white
about the nostrils as he sensed the growing hostility of the crowd,
did not speak except to snarl his offers. Shirkuh rolled in his
saddle, slapped his thighs, yelled his bids, and defiantly
brandished a leathern bag which gave out a musical tinkling.</p>

<p>The excitement of the crowd was at white heat. Ferocity began to
edge their yells. Brent, looking down at the heaving mass, had a
confused impression of dark, convulsed faces, blazing eyes, and
strident voices. Alafdal Khan was sweating, but he did not
interfere, not even when the bidding rose above fifty thousand
rupees.</p>

<p>It was more than a bidding contest; it was the subtle play of
two opposing wills, as hard and supple as tempered steel. Abd el
Khafid realized that if he withdrew now, his prestige would never
recover from the blow. In his rage he made his first mistake.</p>

<p>He rose suddenly in his stirrups, clapping his hands.</p>

<p>"Let there be an end to this madness!" he roared. "No white
slave is worth this much! I declare the auction closed! I buy this
dog for sixty thousand rupees! Take him to my house, slave
master!"</p>

<p>A roar of protest rose from the throng, and Shirkuh drove his
horse alongside the block and leaped off to it, tossing his rein to
a Waziri.</p>

<p>"Is this justice?" he shouted. "Is this done according to
custom? Men of Rub el Harami, I demand justice! I bid sixty-one
thousand rupees. I stand ready to bid more, if necessary! When has
an emir been allowed to use his authority to rob a citizen, and
cheat the people? Nay, we be thieves&mdash;but shall we rob one
another? Who is Abd el Khafid, to trample the customs of the city!
If the customs are broken, what shall hold you together? Rub el
Harami lives only so long as the ancient traditions are observed.
Will you let Abd el Khafid destroy them&mdash;and you?"</p>

<p>A cataract of straining human voices answered him. The crowd had
become a myriad-fanged, flashing-eyed mass of hate.</p>

<p>"<i>Obey the customs!</i>" yelled Shirkuh, and the crowd took up
the yell.</p>

<p>"Obey the customs!" It was the thunder of unreined seas, the
roar of a storm wind ripping through icy passes. Blindly men seized
the slogan, yowling it under a forest of lean arms and clenched
fists. Men go mad on a slogan; conquerors have swept to empire,
prophets to new world religions on a shouted phrase. All the men in
the square were screaming it like a ritual now, rocking and tossing
on their feet, fists clenched, froth on their lips. They no longer
reasoned; they were a forest of blind human emotions, swayed by the
storm wind of a shouted phrase that embodied passion and the urge
to action.</p>

<p>Abd el Khafid lost his head. He drew his sword and cut a man who
was clawing at his stirrup mouthing: "Obey the customs, emir!" and
the spurt of blood edged the yells with murder lust. But as yet the
mob was only a blind, raging monster without a head.</p>

<p>"Clear the <i>suk</i>!" shouted Abd el Khafid.</p>

<p>The lances dipped, and the Black Tigers moved forward
uncertainly. A hail of stones greeted them.</p>

<p>Shirkuh leaped to the edge of the block, lifting his arms,
shouting, cutting the volume of sound by the knifing intensity of
his yell.</p>

<p>"Down with Abd el Khafid! Hail, Alafdal Khan, emir of Rub el
Harami!"</p>

<p>"Hail, Alafdal Khan!" came back from the crowd like a
thunderclap.</p>

<p>Abd el Khafid rose in his stirrups, livid.</p>

<p>"Fools! Are you utterly mad? Shall I call my riders to sweep the
streets clear of you?"</p>

<p>Shirkuh threw back his head and laughed like a wolf howling.</p>

<p>"Call them!" he yelled. "Before you can gather them from the
taverns and dens, we will stain the square with your blood! Prove
your right to rule! You have violated one custom&mdash;redeem
yourself by another! Men of Rub el Harami, is it not a tradition
that an emir must be able to defend his title with the sword?"</p>

<p>"Aye!" roared back the mob.</p>

<p>"Then let Abd el Khafid fight Alafdal Khan!" shouted
Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"Let them fight!" bellowed the mob.</p>

<p>Abd el Khafid's eyes turned red. He was sure of his prowess with
the sword, but this revolt against his authority enraged him to the
point of insanity. This was the very center of his power; here like
a spider he had spun his webs, expecting attack on the fringes, but
never here. Now he was caught off-guard. Too many trusted henchmen
were far afield. Others were scattered throughout the city, useless
to him at the moment. His bodyguard was too small to defy the
crowd. Mentally he promised himself a feast of hangings and
beheadings when he could bring back a sufficient force of men to
Rub el Harami. In the meantime he would settle Alafdal's ambitions
permanently.</p>

<p>"Kingmaker, eh?" he snarled in Shirkuh's face, as he leaped off
his horse to the block. He whipped out his tulwar and swung it
around his head, a sheen of silver in the sun. "I'll nail your head
to the Herati Gate when I've finished with this ox-eyed fool!"</p>

<p>Shirkuh laughed at him and stepped back, herding the slave
masters and their captive to the back of the block. Alafdal Khan
was scrambling to the platform, his tulwar in his hand.</p>

<p>He was not fully straightened on the block when Abd el Khafid
was on him with the fury of a tornado. The crowd cried out, fearing
that the emir's whirlwind speed would envelop the powerful but
slower chief. But it was this very swiftness that undid the
Russian. In his wild fury to kill, Abd el Khafid forgot judgment.
The stroke he aimed at Alafdal's head would have decapitated an ox;
but he began it in mid-stride, and its violence threw his
descending foot out of line. He stumbled, his blade cut thin air as
Alafdal dodged&mdash;and then the Waziri's sword was through
him.</p>

<p>It was over in a flash. Abd el Khafid had practically impaled
himself on the Waziri's blade. The rush, the stroke, the
counter-thrust, and the emir kicking his life out on the stone like
a spitted rat&mdash;it all happened in a mere tick of time that
left the mob speechless.</p>

<p>Shirkuh sprang forward like a panther in the instant of silence
while the crowd held its breath and Alafdal gaped stupidly from the
red tulwar in his hand to the dead man at his feet.</p>

<p>"Hail to Alafdal Khan, emir of Rub el Harami!" yelled Shirkuh,
and the crowd thundered its response.</p>

<p>"On your horse, man, quick!" Shirkuh snarled in Alafdal's ear,
thrusting him toward his steed, while seeming to bow him toward
it.</p>

<p>The crowd was going mad with the senseless joy of a mob that
sees its favorite elevated above them. As Alafdal, still dazed by
the rapidity of events, clambered on his horse, Shirkuh turned on
the stunned Black Tiger riders.</p>

<p>"Dogs!" he thundered. "Form ranks! Escort your new master to the
palace, for his title to be confirmed by the council of imams!"</p>

<p>They were moving unwillingly forward, afraid of the crowd, when
a commotion interrupted the flow of events. Ali Shah and forty
armed horsemen came pushing their way through the crowd and halted
beside the armored riders. The crowd bared its teeth, remembering
the Ghilzai's feud with their new emir. Yet there was iron in Ali
Shah. He did not flinch, but the old indecision wavered in
Alafdal's eyes at the sight of his foe.</p>

<p>Shirkuh turned on Ali Shah with the swift suspicion of a tiger,
but before anyone could speak, a wild figure dashed from among the
Ghilzais and leaped on the block. It was the Shinwari Shirkuh had
ridden down the day before. The man threw a lean arm out toward
Shirkuh.</p>

<p>"He is an impostor, brothers!" he screamed. "I thought I knew
him yesterday! An hour ago I remembered! He is no Kurd! He
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shirkuh shot the man through the body. He staggered to a rolling
fall that carried him to the edge of the block. There he lifted
himself on an elbow, and pointed at Shirkuh. Blood spattered the
Shinwari's beard as he croaked in the sudden silence:</p>

<p>"I swear by the beard of the Prophet, he is no Moslem! <i>He is
El Borak!</i>"</p>

<p>A shudder passed over the crowd.</p>

<p>"Obey the customs!" came Ali Shah's sardonic voice in the
unnatural stillness. "You killed your emir because of a small
custom. There stands a man who has violated the greatest
one&mdash;your enemy, El Borak!"</p>

<p>There was conviction in his voice, yet no one had really doubted
the accusation of the dying Shinwari. The amazing revelation had
struck them all dumb, Brent included. But only for an instant.</p>

<p>The blind reaction of the crowd was as instantaneous as it had
been before. The tense stillness snapped like a banjo string to a
flood of sound:</p>

<p>"Down with the infidels! Death to El Borak! Death to Alafdal
Khan!"</p>

<p>To Brent it seemed that the crowd suddenly rose like a foaming
torrent and flowed over the edge of the block. Above the deafening
clamor he heard the crashing of the big automatic in El Borak's
hand. Blood spattered, and in an instant the edge of the block was
littered by writhing bodies over which the living tripped and
stumbled.</p>

<p>El Borak sprang to Brent, knocked his guards sprawling with the
pistol barrel, and seized the dazed captive, dragged him toward the
black stallion to which the Waziri still clung. The mob was
swarming like wolves about Alafdal and his warriors, and the Black
Tigers and Ali Shah were trying to get at them through the press.
Alafdal bawled something desperate and incoherent to El Borak as he
laid lustily about him with his tulwar. The Waziri chief was almost
crazed with bewilderment. A moment ago he had been emir of Rub el
Harami, with the crowd applauding him. Now the same crowd was
trying to take him out of his saddle.</p>

<p>"Make for your house, Alafdal!" yelled El Borak.</p>

<p>He leaped into the saddle just as the man holding the horse went
down with his head shattered by a cobblestone. The wild figure who
had killed him leaped forward, gibbering, clawing at the rider's
leg. El Borak drove a sharp silver heel into his eye, stretching
him bleeding and screaming on the ground. He ruthlessly slashed off
a hand that grasped at his rein, and beat back a ring of snarling
faces with another swing of his saber.</p>

<p>"Get on behind me, Brent!" he ordered, holding the frantic horse
close to the block.</p>

<p>It was only when he heard the English words, with their
Southwestern accent, that Brent realized that this was no dream,
and he had at last actually encountered the man he had sought.</p>

<p>Men were grasping at Brent. He beat them off with clenched
fists, leaped on the stallion behind the saddle. He grasped the
cantle, resisting the natural impulse to hold onto the man in front
of him. El Borak would need the free use of his body if they won
through that seething mass of frantic humanity which packed the
square from edge to edge. It was a frothing, dark-waved sea,
swirling about islands of horsemen.</p>

<p>But the stallion gathered itself and lunged terribly, knocking
over screaming figures like tenpins. Bones snapped under its hoofs.
Over the heads of the crowd Brent saw Ali Shah and his riders
beating savagely at the mob with their swords, trying to reach
Alafdal Khan. Ali Shah was cool no longer; his dark face was
convulsed.</p>

<p>The stallion waded through that sea of humanity, its rider
slashing right and left, clearing a red road. Brent felt hands
clawing at them as they went by, felt the inexorable hoofs grinding
over writhing bodies. Ahead of them the Waziris, in a compact
formation, were cutting their way toward the west side of the
square. Already a dozen of them had been dragged from their saddles
and torn to pieces.</p>

<p>El Borak dragged his rifle out of its boot, and it banged redly
in the snarling faces, blasting a lane through them. Along that
lane the black stallion thundered, to smite with irresistible
impact the mass hemming in Alafdal Khan. It burst asunder, and the
black horse sped on, while its rider yelled:</p>

<p>"Fall in behind me! We'll make a stand at your house!"</p>

<p>The Waziris closed in behind him. They might have abandoned El
Borak if they had had the choice. But the people included them all
in their blind rage against the breakers of tradition. As they
broke through the press, behind them the Black Tigers brought their
rifles into play for the first time. A hail of bullets swept the
square, emptying half the Waziri saddles. The survivors dashed into
a narrow street.</p>

<p>A mass of snarling figures blocked their way. Men swarmed from
the houses to cut them off. Men were surging into the alley behind
them. A thrown stone numbed Brent's shoulder. El Borak was using
the empty rifle like a mace. In a rush they smote the men massed in
the street.</p>

<p>The great black stallion reared and lashed down with mallet-like
hoofs, and its rider flailed with a rifle stock now splintered and
smeared with blood. But behind them Alafdal's steed stumbled and
fell. Alafdal's disordered turban and his dripping tulwar appeared
for an instant above a sea of heads and tossing arms. His men
plunged madly in to rescue him and were hemmed in by a solid mass
of humanity as more men surged down the street from the square.
Hamstrung horses went down, screaming. El Borak wheeled his
stallion back toward the melee, and as he did so, a swarm of men
burst from a narrow alleyway. One seized Brent's leg and dragged
him from the horse. As they rolled in the dust, the Afghan heaved
Brent below him, mouthing like an ape, and lifted a crooked knife.
Brent saw it glint in the sunlight, had an instant's numb
realization of doom&mdash;then El Borak, reining the rearing
stallion around, leaned from the saddle and smashed the Afghan's
skull with his rifle butt.</p>

<p>The man fell across Brent, and then from an arched doorway an
ancient blunderbuss banged, and the stallion reared and fell
sprawling, half its head shot away. El Borak leaped clear, hit on
his feet like a cat, and hurled the broken rifle in the faces of
the swarm bearing down on him. He leaped back, tearing his saber
clear. It flickered like lightning, and three men fell with cleft
heads. But the mob was blood-mad, heedless of death. Brainlessly
they rushed against him, flailing with staves and bludgeons,
bearing him by their very weight back into an arched doorway. The
panels splintered inward under the impact of the hurtling bodies,
and El Borak vanished from Brent's sight. The mob poured in after
him.</p>

<p>Brent cast off the limp body that lay across him and rose. He
had a brief glimpse of a dark writhing mass where the fight swirled
about the fallen chief, of Ali Shah and his riders beating at the
crowd with their swords&mdash;then a bludgeon, wielded from behind,
fell glancingly on his head, and he fell blind and senseless into
the trampled dust.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Slowly consciousness returned to Stuart Brent. His head ached
dully, and his hair was stiff with clotted blood. He struggled to
his elbows, though the effort made his head swim sickeningly, and
stared about him.</p>

<p>He was lying on a stone floor littered with moldy straw. Light
came in from a high-barred window. There was a door with a broad
barred wicket. Other figures lay near him and one sat cross-legged,
staring at him blankly. It was Alafdal Khan.</p>

<p>The Waziri's beard was torn, his turban gone. His features were
swollen, and bruised, and skinned, one ear mangled. Three of his
men lay near, one groaning. All had been frightfully beaten, and
the man who groaned seemed to have a broken arm.</p>

<p>"They didn't kill us!" marveled Brent.</p>

<p>Alafdal Khan swung his great head like an ox in pain and
groaned: "Cursed be the day I laid eyes on El Borak!"</p>

<p>One of the men crept painfully to Brent's side.</p>

<p>"I am Achmet, sahib," he said, spitting blood from a broken
tooth. "There lie Hassan and Suleiman. Ali Shah and his men beat
the dogs off us, but they had mauled us so that all were dead save
these you see. Our lord is like one touched by Allah."</p>

<p>"Are we in the Abode of the Damned?" asked Brent.</p>

<p>"Nay, sahib. We are in the common jail which lies near the west
wall."</p>

<p>"Why did they save us from the mob?"</p>

<p>"For a more exquisite end!" Achmet shuddered. "Does the sahib
know the death the Black Tigers reserve for traitors?"</p>

<p>"No!" Brent's lips were suddenly dry.</p>

<p>"We will be flayed tomorrow night in the square. It is an old
pagan custom. Rub El Harami is a city of customs."</p>

<p>"So I have learned!" agreed Brent grimly. "What of El
Borak?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. He vanished into a house, with many men in
pursuit. They must have overtaken and slain him."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife6" name="knife6">VI. &mdash; THE EXECUTIONER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN the door in the archway burst inward under
the impact of Gordon's iron-hard shoulders, he tumbled backward
into a dim, carpeted hallway. His pursuers, crowding after him,
jammed in the doorway in a sweating, cursing crush which his saber
quickly turned into a shambles. Before they could clear the door of
the dead, he was racing down the hall.</p>

<p>He made a turn to the left, ran across a chamber where veiled
women squealed and scattered, emerged into a narrow alley, leaped a
low wall, and found himself in a small garden. Behind him sounded
the clamor of his hunters, momentarily baffled. He crossed the
garden and through a partly open door came into a winding corridor.
Somewhere a slave was singing in the weird chant of the Soudan,
apparently heedless of the dog-fight noises going on upon the other
side of the wall. Gordon moved down the corridor, careful to keep
his silver heels from clinking. Presently he came to a winding
staircase and up it he went, making no noise on the richly carpeted
steps. As he came out into an upper corridor, he saw a curtained
door and heard beyond it a faint, musical clinking which he
recognized. He glided to the partly open door and peered through
the curtains. In a richly appointed room, lighted by a tinted
skylight, a portly, gray-bearded man sat with his back to the door,
counting coins out of a leather bag into an ebony chest. He was so
intent on the business at hand that he did not seem aware of the
growing clamor below. Or perhaps street riots were too common in
Rub el Harami to attract the attention of a thrifty merchant,
intent only on increasing his riches.</p>

<p>Pad of swift feet on the stair, and Gordon slipped behind the
partly open door. A richly clad young man, with a scimitar in his
hand, ran up the steps and hurried to the door. He thrust the
curtains aside and paused on the threshold, panting with haste and
excitement.</p>

<p>"Father!" he shouted. "El Borak is in the city! Do you not hear
the din below? They are hunting him through the houses! He may be
in our very house! Men are searching the lower rooms even now!"</p>

<p>"Let them hunt him," replied the old man. "Remain here with me,
Abdullah. Shut that door and lock it. El Borak is a tiger."</p>

<p>As the youth turned, instead of the yielding curtain behind him,
he felt the contact of a hard, solid body, and simultaneously a
corded arm locked about his neck, choking his startled cry. Then he
felt the light prick of a knife and he went limp with fright, his
scimitar sliding from his nerveless hand. The old man had turned at
his son's gasp, and now he froze, gray beneath his beard, his
moneybag dangling.</p>

<p>Gordon thrust the youth into the room, not releasing his grip,
and let the curtains close behind them.</p>

<p>"Do not move," he warned the old man softly.</p>

<p>He dragged his trembling captive across the room and into a
tapestried alcove. Before he vanished into it, he spoke briefly to
the merchant:</p>

<p>"They are coming up the stairs, looking for me. Meet them at the
door and send them away. Do not play me false by even the flick of
an eyelash, if you value your son's life."</p>

<p>The old man's eyes were dilated with pure horror. Gordon well
knew the power of paternal affection. In a welter of hate,
treachery, and cruelty, it was a real and vital passion, as strong
as the throb of the human heart. The merchant might defy Gordon
were his own life alone at stake; but the American knew he would
not risk the life of his son.</p>

<p>Sandals stamped up the stair, and rough voices shouted. The old
man hurried to the door, stumbling in his haste. He thrust his head
through the curtains, in response to a bawled question. His reply
came plainly to Gordon.</p>

<p>"El Borak? Dogs! Take your clamor from my walls! If El Borak is
in the house of Nureddin el Aziz, he is in the rooms below. Ye have
searched them? Then look for him elsewhere, and a curse on
you!"</p>

<p>The footsteps dwindled down the stair, the voices faded and
ceased.</p>

<p>Gordon pushed Abdullah out into the chamber.</p>

<p>"Shut the door!" the American ordered.</p>

<p>Nureddin obeyed, with poisonous eyes but fear-twisted face.</p>

<p>"I will stay in this room a while," said Gordon. "If you play me
false&mdash;if any man besides yourself crosses that threshold, the
first stroke of the fight will plunge my blade in Abdullah's
heart."</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" asked Nureddin nervously.</p>

<p>"Give me the key to that door. No, toss it on the table there.
Now go forth into the streets and learn if the Feringi, or any of
the Waziris live. Then return to me. And if you love your son, keep
my secret!"</p>

<p>The merchant left the room without a word, and Gordon bound
Abdullah's wrists and ankles with strips torn from the curtains.
The youth was gray with fear, incapable of resistance. Gordon laid
him on a divan, and reloaded his big automatic. He discarded the
tattered remnants of his robe. The white silk shirt beneath was
torn, revealing his muscular breast, his close-fitting breeches
smeared with blood.</p>

<p>Nureddin returned presently, rapping at the door and naming
himself.</p>

<p>Gordon unlocked the door and stepped back, his pistol muzzle a
few inches from Abdullah's ear. But the old man was alone when he
hurried in. He closed the door and sighed with relief to see
Abdullah uninjured.</p>

<p>"What is your news?" demanded Gordon.</p>

<p>"Men comb the city for you, and Ali Shah has declared himself
prince of the Black Tigers. The imams have confirmed his claim. The
mob has looted Alafdal Khan's house and slain every Waziri they
could find. But the Feringi lives, and so likewise does Alafdal
Khan and three of his men. They lie in the common jail. Tomorrow
night they die."</p>

<p>"Do your slaves suspect my presence?"</p>

<p>"Nay. None saw you enter."</p>

<p>"Good. Bring wine and food. Abdullah shall taste it before I
eat."</p>

<p>"My slaves will think it strange to see me bearing food!"</p>

<p>"Go to the stair and call your orders down to them. Bid them set
the food outside the door and then return downstairs."</p>

<p>This was done, and Gordon ate and drank heartily, sitting
cross-legged on the divan at Abdullah's head, his pistol on his
lap.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The day wore on. El Borak sat motionless, his eternal vigilance
never relaxing. The Afghans watched him, hating and fearing him. As
evening approached, he spoke to Nureddin after a silence that had
endured for hours.</p>

<p>"Go and procure for me a robe and cloak of black silk, and a
black helmet such as is worn by the Black Tigers. Bring me also
boots with lower heels than these&mdash;and not silver&mdash;and a
mask such as members of the clan wear on secret missions."</p>

<p>The old man frowned. "The garments I can procure from my own
shop. But how am I to secure the helmet and mask?"</p>

<p>"That is thy affair. Gold can open any door, they say. Go!"</p>

<p>As soon as Nureddin had departed, reluctantly, Gordon kicked off
his boots, and next removed his mustache, using the keen-edged
dagger for a razor. With its removal vanished the last trace of
Shirkuh the Kurd.</p>

<p>Twilight had come, to Rub el Harami. The room seemed full of a
blue mist, blurring objects. Gordon had lighted a bronze lamp when
Nureddin returned with the articles El Borak had ordered.</p>

<p>"Lay them on the table and sit down on the divan with your hands
behind you," Gordon commanded.</p>

<p>When the merchant had done so, the American bound his wrists and
ankles. Then Gordon donned the boots and the robe, placed the black
lacquered steel helmet on his head, and drew the black cloak about
him; lastly he put on the mask which fell in folds of black silk to
his breast, with two slits over his eyes. Turning to Nureddin, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Is there a likeness between me and another?"</p>

<p>"Allah preserve us! You are one with Dhira Azrail, the
executioner of the Black Tigers, when he goes forth to slay at the
emir's command."</p>

<p>"Good. I have heard much of this man who slays secretly, who
moves through the night like a black jinn of destruction. Few have
seen his face, men say."</p>

<p>"Allah defend me from ever seeing it!" said Nureddin
fervently.</p>

<p>Gordon glanced at the skylight. Stars twinkled beyond it.</p>

<p>"I go now from your house, Nureddin," said he. "But lest you
rouse the household in your zeal of hospitality, I must gag you and
your son."</p>

<p>"We will smother!" exclaimed Nureddin. "We will starve in this
room!"</p>

<p>"You will do neither one nor the other," Gordon assured him. "No
man I gagged ever smothered. Has not Allah given you nostrils
through which to breathe? Your servants will find you and release
you in the morning."</p>

<p>This was deftly accomplished, and Gordon advised:</p>

<p>"Observe that I have not touched your moneybags, and be
grateful!"</p>

<p>He left the room, locking the door behind him. He hoped it would
be several hours before either of his captives managed to work the
gag out of his mouth and arouse the household with his yells.</p>

<p>Moving like a black-clad ghost through the dimly lighted
corridors, Gordon descended the winding stair and came into the
lower hallway. A black slave sat cross-legged at the foot of the
stair, but his head was sunk on his broad breast, and his snores
resounded through the hall. He did not see or hear the
velvet-footed shadow that glided past him. Gordon slid back the
bolt on the door and emerged into the garden, whose broad leaves
and petals hung motionless in the still starlight. Outside, the
city was silent. Men had gone early behind locked doors, and few
roamed the streets, except those patrols searching ceaselessly for
El Borak.</p>

<p>He climbed the wall and dropped into the narrow alley. He knew
where the common jail was, for in his role of Shirkuh he had
familiarized himself with the general features of the town. He kept
close to the wall, under the shadows of the overhanging balconies,
but he did not slink. His movements were calculated to suggest a
man who has no reason for concealment, but who chooses to shun
conspicuousness.</p>

<p>The street seemed empty. From some of the roof gardens came the
wail of native citterns, or voices lifted in song. Somewhere a
wretch screamed agonizingly to the impact of blows on naked
flesh.</p>

<p>Once Gordon heard the clink of steel ahead of him and turned
quickly into a dark alley to let a patrol swing past. They were men
in armor, on foot, but carrying cocked rifles at the ready and
peering in every direction. They kept close together, and their
vigilance reflected their fear of the quarry they hunted. When they
rounded the first corner, he emerged from his hiding place and
hurried on.</p>

<p>But he had to depend on his disguise before he reached the
prison. A squad of armed men rounded the corner ahead of him, and
no concealment offered itself. At the sound of their footsteps he
had slowed his pace to a stately stride. With his cloak folded
close about him, his head slightly bent as if in somber meditation,
he moved on, paying no heed to the soldiers. They shrank back,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"Allah preserve us! It is Dhira Azrail&mdash;the Arm of the
Angel of Death! An order has been given!"</p>

<p>They hurried on, without looking back. A few moments later
Gordon had reached the lowering arch of the prison door. A dozen
guardsmen stood alertly under the arch, their rifle barrels
gleaming bluely in the glare of a torch thrust in a niche in the
wall. These rifles were instantly leveled at the figure that moved
out of the shadows. Then the men hesitated, staring wide-eyed at
the somber black shape standing silently before them.</p>

<p>"Your pardon!" entreated the captain of the guard, saluting. "We
could not recognize&mdash;in the shadow&mdash;We did not know an
order had been given."</p>

<p>A ghostly hand, half muffled in the black cloak, gestured toward
the door, and the guardsmen opened it in stumbling haste, salaaming
deeply. As the black figure moved through, they closed the door and
made fast the chain.</p>

<p>"The mob will see no show in the <i>suk</i> after all," muttered
one.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife7" name="knife7">VII. &mdash; IN THE PRISON</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IN the cell where Brent and his companions lay,
time dragged on leaden feet. Hassan groaned with the pain of his
broken arm. Suleiman cursed Ali Shah in a monotonous drone. Achmet
was inclined to talk, but his comments cast no light of hope on
their condition. Alafdal Khan sat like a man in a daze.</p>

<p>No food was given them, only scummy water that smelled. They
used most of it to bathe their wounds. Brent suggested trying to
set Hassan's arm, but the others showed no interest. Hassan had
only another day to live. Why bother? Then there was nothing with
which to make splints.</p>

<p>Brent mostly lay on his back, watching the little square of dry
blue Himalayan sky through the barred window.</p>

<p>He watched the blue fade, turn pink with sunset and deep purple
with twilight; it became a square of blue-black velvet, set with a
cluster of white stars. Outside, in the corridor that ran between
the cells, bronze lamps glowed, and he wondered vaguely how far, on
the backs of groaning camels, had come the oil that filled
them.</p>

<p>In their light a cloaked figure came down the corridor, and a
scarred sardonic face was pressed to the bars. Achmet gasped, his
eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"Do you know me, dog?" inquired the stranger.</p>

<p>Achmet nodded, moistening lips suddenly dry.</p>

<p>"Are we to die tonight, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>The head under the flowing headdress was shaken.</p>

<p>"Not unless you are fool enough to speak my name. Your
companions do not know me. I have not come in my usual capacity,
but to guard the prison tonight. Ali Shah fears El Borak might seek
to aid you."</p>

<p>"Then El Borak lives!" ejaculated Brent, to whom everything else
in the conversation had been unintelligible.</p>

<p>"He still lives." The stranger laughed. "But he will be found,
if he is still in the city. If he has fled&mdash;well, the passes
have been closed by heavy guards, and horsemen are combing the
plain and the hills. If he comes here tonight, he will be dealt
with. Ali Shah chose to send me rather than a squad of riflemen.
Not even the guards know who I am."</p>

<p>As he turned away toward the rear end of the corridor, Brent
asked:</p>

<p>"Who is that man?"</p>

<p>But Achmet's flow of conversation had been dried up by the sight
of that lean, sardonic face. He shuddered, and drew away from his
companions, sitting cross-legged with bowed head. From time to time
his shoulders twitched, as if he had seen a reptile or a ghoul.</p>

<p>Brent sighed and stretched himself on the straw. His battered
limbs ached, and he was hungry.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the outer door clang. Voices came faintly to
him, and the door closed again. Idly he wondered if they were
changing the guard. Then he heard the soft rustle of cloth. A man
was coming down the corridor. An instant later he came into the
range of their vision, and his appearance clutched Brent with an
icy dread. Clad in black from head to foot, a spired helmet gave
him an appearance of unnatural height. He was enveloped in the
folds of a black cloak. But the most sinister implication was in
the black mask which fell in loose folds to his breast.</p>

<p>Brent's flesh crawled. Why was that silent, cowled figure coming
to their dungeon in the blackness and stillness of the night
hours?</p>

<p>The others glared wildly; even Alafdal was shaken out of his
daze. Hassan whimpered:</p>

<p>"It is Dhira Azrail!"</p>

<p>But bewilderment mingled with the fear in Achmet's eyes.</p>

<p>The scar-faced stranger came suddenly from the depths of the
corridor and confronted the masked man just before the door. The
lamplight fell on his face, upon which played a faint, cynical
smile.</p>

<p>"What do you wish? I am in charge here."</p>

<p>The masked man's voice was muffled. It sounded cavernous and
ghostly, fitting his appearance.</p>

<p>"I am Dhira Azrail. An order has been given. Open the door."</p>

<p>The scarred one salaamed deeply, and murmured: "Hearkening and
obedience, my lord!"</p>

<p>He produced a key, turned it in the lock, pulled open the heavy
door, and bowed again, humbly indicating for the other to enter.
The masked man was moving past him when Achmet came to life
startlingly.</p>

<p>"<i>El Borak!</i>" he screamed. "Beware! <i>He</i> is Dhira
Azrail!"</p>

<p>The masked man wheeled like a flash, and the knife the other had
aimed at his back glanced from his helmet as he turned. The real
Dhira Azrail snarled like a wild cat, but before he could strike
again, El Borak's right fist met his jaw with a crushing impact.
Flesh, and bone, and consciousness gave way together, and the
executioner sagged senseless to the floor.</p>

<p>As Gordon sprang into the cell, the prisoners stumbled dazedly
to their feet. Except Achmet, who, knowing that the scarred man was
Dhira Azrail, had realized that the man in the mask must be El
Borak&mdash;and had acted accordingly&mdash;they did not grasp the
situation until Gordon threw his mask back.</p>

<p>"Can you all walk?" rapped Gordon. "Good! We'll have to pull out
afoot. I couldn't arrange for horses."</p>

<p>Alafdal Khan looked at him dully.</p>

<p>"Why should I go?" he muttered. "Yesterday I had wealth and
power. Now I am a penniless vagabond. If I leave Rub el Harami, the
ameer will cut off my head. It was an ill day I met you, El Borak!
You made a tool of me for your intrigues."</p>

<p>"So I did, Alafdal Khan." Gordon faced him squarely. "But I
would have made you emir in good truth. The dice have fallen
against us, but our lives remain. And a bold man can rebuild his
fortune. I promise you that if we escape, the ameer will pardon you
and these men."</p>

<p>"His word is not wind," urged Achmet, "He has come to aid us,
when he might have escaped alone. Take heart, my lord!"</p>

<p>Gordon was stripping the weapons from the senseless executioner.
The man wore two German automatics, a tulwar, and a curved knife.
Gordon gave a pistol to Brent, and one to Alafdal; Achmet received
the tulwar, and Suleiman the knife, and Gordon gave his own knife
to Hassan. The executioner's garments were given to Brent, who was
practically naked. The oriental garments felt strange, but he was
grateful for their warmth.</p>

<p>The brief struggle had not produced any noise likely to be
overheard by the guard beyond the arched door. Gordon led his band
down the corridor, between rows of empty cells, until they came to
the rear door. There was no guard outside, as it was deemed too
strong to be forced by anything short of artillery. It was of
massive metal, fastened by a huge bar set in gigantic iron brackets
bolted powerfully into the stone. It took all Gordon's strength to
lift it out of the brackets and lean it against the wall, but then
the door swung silently open, revealing the blackness of a narrow
alley into which they filed.</p>

<p>Gordon pulled the door to behind them. How much leeway they had
he did not know. The guard would eventually get suspicious when the
supposed Dhira Azrail did not emerge, but he believed it would take
them a good while to overcome their almost superstitious dread of
the executioner enough to investigate. As for the real Dhira
Azrail, he would not recover his senses for hours.</p>

<p>The prison was not far from the west wall. They met no one as
they hurried through winding, ill-smelling alleys until they
reached the wall at the place where a flight of narrow steps led up
to the parapets. Men were patrolling the wall. They crouched in the
shadows below the stair and heard the tread of two sentries who met
on the firing ledge, exchange muffled greetings, and passed on. As
the footsteps dwindled, they glided up the steps. Gordon had
secured a rope from an unguarded camel stall. He made it fast by a
loose loop to a merlon. One by one they slid swiftly down. Gordon
was last, and he flipped the rope loose and coiled it. They might
need it again.</p>

<p>They crouched an instant beneath the wall. A wind stole across
the plain and stirred Brent's hair. They were free, armed, and
outside the devil city. But they were afoot, and the passes were
closed against them. Without a word they filed after Gordon across
the shadowed plain.</p>

<p>At a safe distance their leader halted, and the men grouped
around him, a vague cluster in the starlight.</p>

<p>"All the roads that lead from Rub el Harami are barred against
us," he said abruptly. "They've filled the passes with soldiers.
We'll have to make our way through the mountains the best way we
can. And the only direction in which we can hope to eventually find
safety is the east."</p>

<p>"The Great Range bars our path to the east," muttered Alafdal
Khan. "Only through the Pass of Nadir Khan may we cross it."</p>

<p>"There is another way," answered Gordon. "It is a pass which
lies far to the north of Nadir Khan. There isn't any road leading
to it, and it hasn't been used for many generations. But it has a
name&mdash;the Afridis call it the Pass of Swords and I've seen it
from the east. I've never been west of it before, but maybe I can
lead you to it. It lies many days' march from here, through wild
mountains which none of us has ever traversed. But it's our only
chance. We must have horses and food. Do any of you know where
horses can be procured outside the city?"</p>

<p>"Yonder on the north side of the plain," said Achmet, "where a
gorge opens from the hills, there dwells a peasant who owns seven
horses&mdash;wretched, flea-bitten beasts they are, though."</p>

<p>"They must suffice. Lead us to them."</p>

<p>The going was not easy, for the plain was littered with rocks
and cut with shallow gullies. All except Gordon were stiff and sore
from their beatings, and Hassan's broken arm was a knifing agony to
him. It was after more than an hour and a half of tortuous travel
that the low mud-and-rock pen loomed before them and they heard the
beasts stamping and snorting within it, alarmed by the sounds of
their approach. The cluster of buildings squatted in the widening
mouth of a shallow canyon, with a shadowy background of bare
hills.</p>

<p>Gordon went ahead of the rest, and when the peasant came yawning
out of his hut, looking for the wolves he thought were frightening
his property, he never saw the tigerish shadow behind him until
Gordon's iron fingers shut off his wind. A threat hissed in his ear
reduced him to quaking quiescence, though he ventured a wail of
protest as he saw other shadowy figures saddling and leading out
his beasts.</p>

<p>"Sahibs, I am a poor man! These beasts are not fit for great
lords to ride, but they are all of my property! Allah be my
witness!"</p>

<p>"Break his head," advised Hassan, whom pain made
bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>But Gordon stilled their captive's weeping with a handful of
gold which represented at least three times the value of his whole
herd. Dazzled by this rich reward, the peasant ceased his
complaints, cursed his whimpering wives and children into silence,
and at Gordon's order brought forth all the food that was in his
hut&mdash;leathery loaves of bread, jerked mutton, salt, and eggs.
It was little enough with which to start a hard journey. Feed for
the horses was slung in a bag behind each saddle, and loaded on the
spare horse.</p>

<p>While the beasts were being saddled, Gordon, by the light of a
torch held inside a shed by a disheveled woman, whittled splints,
tore up a shirt for bandages, and set Hassan's arm&mdash;a
sickening task, because of the swollen condition of the member. It
left Hassan green-faced and gagging, yet he was able to mount with
the others.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the small hours they rode up the pathless
gorge which led into the trackless hills. Hassan was insistent on
cutting the throats of the entire peasant family, but Gordon vetoed
this.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he'll head for the city to betray us, as soon as
we, get out of sight. But he'll have to go on foot, and we'll lose
ourselves in the hills before he gets there."</p>

<p>"There are men trained like bloodhounds in Rub el Harami," said
Achmet. "They can track a wolf over bare rock."</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Sunrise found them high up in the hills, out of sight of the
plain, picking their way up treacherous shale-littered slopes,
following dry watercourses, always careful to keep below the sky
line as much as possible. Brent was already confused. They seemed
lost in a labyrinth of bare hills, in which he was able to
recognize general directions only by glimpses of the snow- capped
peaks of the Great Range ahead.</p>

<p>As they rode, he studied their leader. There was nothing in
Gordon's manner by which he could recognize Shirkuh the Kurd. Gone
was the Kurdish accent, the boyish, reckless merry-mad swagger, the
peacock vanity of dress, even the wide-legged horseman's stride.
The real Gordon was almost the direct antithesis of the role he had
assumed. In place of the strutting, gaudily clad, braggart youth,
there was a direct, hard-eyed man, who wasted no words and about
whom there was no trace of egotism or braggadocio. There was
nothing of the Oriental about his countenance now, and Brent knew
that the mustache alone had not accounted for the perfection of his
disguise. That disguise had not depended on any mechanical device;
it had been a perfection of mimicry. By no artificial means, but by
completely entering into the spirit of the role he had assumed,
Gordon had altered the expression of his face, his bearing, his
whole personality. He had so marvelously portrayed a personality so
utterly different from his own, that it seemed impossible that the
two were one. Only the eyes were unchanged&mdash;the gleaming,
untamed black eyes, reflecting a barbarism of vitality and
character.</p>

<p>But if not garrulous, Gordon did not prove taciturn, when Brent
began to ask questions.</p>

<p>"I was on another trail when I left Kabul," he said. "No need to
take up your time with that now. I knew the Black Tigers had a new
emir, but didn't know it was Jakrovitch, of course. I'd never
bothered to investigate the Black Tigers; didn't consider them
important. I left Kabul alone and picked up half a dozen Afridi
friends on the way. I became a Kurd after I was well on my road.
That's why you lost my trail. None knew me except my Afridis.</p>

<p>"But before I completed my mission, word came through the hills
that a Feringi with an escort of Kabuli was looking for me. News
travels fast and far through the tribes. I rode back looking for
you, and finally sighted you, as a prisoner. I didn't know who'd
captured you, but I saw there were too many for us to fight, so I
went down to parley. As soon as I saw Muhammad ez Zahir, I guessed
who they were, and told them that lie about being lost in the hills
and wanting to get to Rub el Harami. I signaled my men&mdash;you
saw them. They were the men who fired on us as we were coming into
the valley where the well was."</p>

<p>"But you shot one of them!"</p>

<p>"I shot over their heads. Just as they purposely missed us. My
shots&mdash;one, pause, and then three in succession&mdash;were a
signal that I was going on with the troop, and for them to return
to our rendezvous on Kalat el Jehungir and wait for me. When one
fell forward on his horse, it was a signal that they understood. We
have an elaborate code of signals, of all kinds.</p>

<p>"I intended trying to get you away that night, but when you gave
me Stockton's message, it changed the situation. If the new emir
was Jakrovitch, I knew what it meant. Imagine India under the rule
of a swine like Jakrovitch!</p>

<p>"I knew that Jakrovitch was after the gold in Shaitan's Cave. It
couldn't be anything else. Oh, yes, I knew the custom of offering
gold each year to the Devil. Stockton and I had discussed the peril
to the peace of Asia if a white adventurer ever got his hands on
it.</p>

<p>"So I knew I'd have to go to Rub el Harami. I didn't dare tell
you who I was&mdash;too many men spying around all the time. When
we got to the city, Fate put Alafdal Khan in my hands. A true
Moslem emir is no peril to the Indian Empire. A real Oriental
wouldn't touch Shaitan's gold to save his life. I meant to make
Alafdal emir. I had to tell him who I was before he'd believe I had
a chance of doing it.</p>

<p>"I didn't premeditatedly precipitate that riot in the
<i>suk</i>. I simply took advantage of it. I wanted to get you
safely out of Jakrovitch's hands before I started anything, so I
persuaded Alafdal Kahn that we needed you in our plot, and he put
up the money to buy you. Then during the auction Jakrovitch lost
his head and played into my hands. Everything would have worked out
perfectly, if it hadn't been for Ali Shah and his man, that
Shinwari! It was inevitable that somebody would recognize me sooner
or later, but I hoped to destroy Jakrovitch, set Alafdal solidly in
power, and have an avenue of escape open for you and me before that
happened."</p>

<p>"At least Jakrovitch is dead," said Brent.</p>

<p>"We didn't fail there," agreed Gordon. "Ali Shah is no menace to
the world. He won't touch the gold. The organization Jakrovitch
built up will fall apart, leaving only the comparatively harmless
core of the Black Tigers as it was before his coming. We've drawn
their fangs, as far as the safety of India is concerned. All that's
at stake now are our own lives&mdash;but I'll admit I'm selfish
enough to want to preserve them."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="knife8" name="knife8">VIII. &mdash; THE PASS OF
SWORDS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">BRENT beat his numbed hands together for warmth.
For days they had been struggling through the trackless hills. The
lean horses stumbled against the blast that roared between
intervals of breathless sun blaze. The riders clung to the saddles
when they could, or stumbled on afoot, leading their mounts,
continually gnawed by hunger. At night they huddled together for
warmth, men and beasts, in the lee of some rock or cliff, only
occasionally finding wood enough to build a tiny fire.</p>

<p>Gordon's endurance was amazing. It was he who led the way,
finding water, erasing their too obvious tracks, caring for the
mounts when the others were too exhausted to move. He gave his
cloak and robe to the ragged Waziris, himself seeming impervious to
the chill winds as to the blazing sun.</p>

<p>The pack horse died. There was little food left for the horses,
less for the men. They had left the hills now and were in the
higher reaches, with the peaks of the Great Range looming through
the mists ahead of them. Life became a pain-tinged dream to Brent
in which one scene stood out vividly. They sat their gaunt horses
at the head of a long valley and saw, far back, white dots moving
in the morning mists.</p>

<p>"They have found our trail," muttered Alafdal Khan. "They will
not quit it while we live. They have good horses and plenty of
food."</p>

<p>And thereafter from time to time they glimpsed, far away and
below and behind them, those sinister moving dots, that slowly,
slowly cut down the long lead. Gordon ceased his attempts to hide
their trail, and they headed straight for the backbone of the range
which rose like a rampart before them&mdash;scarecrow men on
phantom horses, following a grim-faced chief.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>On a midday when the sky was as clear as chilled steel, they
struggled over a lofty mountain shoulder and sighted a notch that
broke the chain of snow- clad summits, and beyond it, the pinnacle
of a lesser, more distant peak.</p>

<p>"The Pass of Swords," said Gordon. "The peak beyond it is Kalat
el Jehungir, where my men are waiting for me. There will be a man
sweeping the surrounding country all the time with powerful field
glasses. I don't know whether they can see smoke this far or not,
but I'm going to send up a signal for them to meet us at the
pass."</p>

<p>Achmet climbed the mountainside with him. The others were too
weak for the attempt. High up on the giddy slope they found enough
green wood to make a fire that smoked. Presently, manipulated with
ragged cloak, balls of thick black smoke rolled upward against the
blue. It was the old Indian technique of Gordon's native plains,
and Brent knew it was a thousand-to-one shot. Yet hillmen had eyes
like hawks.</p>

<p>They descended the shoulder and lost sight of the pass. Then
they started climbing once more, over slopes and crags and along
the rims of gigantic precipices. It was on one of those ledges that
Suleiman's horse stumbled and screamed and went over the edge, to
smash to a pulp with its rider a thousand feet below, while the
others stared helplessly.</p>

<p>It was at the foot of the long canyon that pitched upward toward
the pass that the starving horses reached the limit of their
endurance. The fugitives killed one and haggled off chunks of
gristly flesh with their knives. They scorched the meat over a tiny
fire, scarcely tasting it as they bolted it. Bodies and nerves were
numb for rest and sleep. Brent clung to one thought&mdash;if the
Afridis had seen the signal, they would be waiting at the pass,
with fresh horses. On fresh horses they could escape, for the
mounts of their pursuers must be nearly exhausted, too.</p>

<p>On foot they struggled up the steep canyon. Night fell while
they struggled, but they did not halt. All through the night they
drove their agonized bodies on, and at dawn they emerged from the
mouth of the canyon to a broad slope that tilted up to the gap of
clear sky cut in the mountain wall. It was empty. The Afridis were
not there. Behind them white dots were moving inexorably up the
canyon.</p>

<p>"We'll make our last stand at the mouth of the pass," said
Gordon.</p>

<p>His eyes swept his phantom crew with a strange remorse. They
looked like dead men. They reeled on their feet, their heads
swimming with exhaustion and dizziness.</p>

<p>"Sorry about it all," he said. "Sorry, Brent."</p>

<p>"Stockton was my friend," said Brent, and then could have cursed
himself, had he had the strength. It sounded so trite, so
melodramatic.</p>

<p>"Alafdal, I'm sorry," said Gordon. "Sorry for all you men."</p>

<p>Alafdal lifted his head like a lion throwing back his mane.</p>

<p>"Nay, El Borak! You made a king of me. I was but a glutton and a
sot, dreaming dreams I was too timid and too lazy to attempt. You
gave me a moment of glory. It is worth all the rest of my
life."</p>

<p>Painfully they struggled up to the head of the pass. Brent
crawled the last few yards, till Gordon lifted him to his feet.
There in the mouth of the great corridor that ran between echoing
cliffs, their hair blowing in the icy wind, they looked back the
way they had come and saw their pursuers, dots no longer, but men
on horses. There was a group of them within a mile, a larger
cluster far back down the canyon. The toughest and best-mounted
riders had drawn away from the others.</p>

<p>The fugitives lay behind boulders in the mouth of the pass. They
had three pistols, a saber, a tulwar, and a knife between them. The
riders had seen their quarry turn at bay; their rifles glinted in
the early-morning light as they flogged their reeling horses up the
slope. Brent recognized Ali Shah himself, his arm in a sling;
Muhammad ez Zahir; the black-bearded Yusufzai captain. A group of
grim warriors were at their heels. All were gaunt-faced from the
long grind. They came on recklessly, firing as they came. Yet the
men at bay drew first blood.</p>

<p>Alafdal Khan, a poor shot and knowing it, had exchanged his
pistol for Achmet's tulwar. Now Achmet sighted and fired and
knocked a rider out of his saddle almost at the limit of pistol
range. In his exultation he yelled and incautiously lifted his head
above the boulder. A volley of rifle fire spattered the rock with
splashes of hot lead, and one bullet hit Achmet between the eyes.
Alafdal snatched the pistol as it fell and began firing. His eyes
were bloodshot, his aim wild. But a horse fell, pinning its
rider.</p>

<p>Above the crackling of the Luger came the doom-like crash of
Gordon's Colt. Only the toss of his horse's head saved Ali Shah.
The horse caught the bullet meant for him, and Ali Shah sprang
clear as it fell, rolling to cover. The others abandoned their
horses and followed suit. They came wriggling up the slope, firing
as they came, keeping to cover.</p>

<p>Brent realized that he was firing the other German pistol only
when he heard a man scream and saw him fall across a boulder.
Vaguely, then, he realized that he had killed another man. Alafdal
Khan had emptied his pistol without doing much harm. Brent fired
and missed, scored a hit, and missed again. His hand shook with
weakness, and his eyes played him tricks. But Gordon was not
missing. It seemed to Brent that every time the Colt crashed a man
screamed and fell. The slope was littered with white-clad figures.
They had not worn their black armor on that chase.</p>

<p>Perhaps the madness of the high places had entered Ali Shah's
brain on that long pursuit. At any rate he would not wait for the
rest of his men, plodding far behind him. Like a madman he drove
his warriors to the assault. They came on, firing and dying in the
teeth of Gordon's bullets till the slope was a shambles. But the
survivors came grimly on, nearer and nearer, and then suddenly they
had broken cover and were charging like a gust of hill wind.</p>

<p>Gordon missed Ali Shah with his last bullet and killed the man
behind him, and then like ghosts rising from the ground on Judgment
Day the fugitives rose and grappled with their pursuers.</p>

<p>Brent fired his last shot full into the face of a savage who
rushed at him, clubbing a rifle. Death halted the man's charge, but
the rifle stock fell, numbing Brent's shoulder and hurling him to
the ground, and there, as he writhed vainly, he saw the brief
madness of the fight that raged about him.</p>

<p>He saw the crippled Hassan, snarling like a wounded wolf, beaten
down by a Ghilzai who stood with one foot on his neck and
repeatedly drove a broken lance through his body. Squirming under
the merciless heel, Hassan slashed blindly upward with El Borak's
knife in his death agony, and the Ghilzai staggered drunkenly away,
blood gushing from the great vein which had been severed behind his
knee. He fell dying a few feet from his victim.</p>

<p>Brent saw Ali Shah shoot Alafdal Khan through the body as they
came face to face, and Alafdal Khan, dying on his feet, split his
enemy's head with one tremendous swing of his tulwar, so they fell
together.</p>

<p>Brent saw Gordon cut down the black-bearded Yusufzai captain,
and spring at Muhammad ez Zahir with a hate too primitive to accord
his foe an honorable death. He parried Muhammad's tulwar and dashed
his saber guard into the Afghan's face. Killing his man was not
enough for his berserk rage; all his roused passion called for a
dog's death for his enemy. And like a raging fury he battered the
Afghan back and down with blows of the guard and hilt, refusing to
honor him by striking with the blade, until Muhammad fell and lay
with broken skull.</p>

<p>Gordon lurched about to face down the slope, the only man on his
feet. He stood swaying on wide-braced feet among the dead, and
shook the blood from his eyes. They were as red as flame burning on
black water. He took a fresh grip on the bloody hilt of his saber,
and glared at the horsemen spurring up the canyon&mdash;at bay at
last, drunken with slaughter, and conscious only of the blind lust
to slay and slay before he himself sank in the red welter of his
last, grim fight.</p>

<p>Then hoofs rang loud on the rock behind him, and he wheeled,
blade lifted&mdash;to check suddenly, a wild, bloodstained figure
against the sunrise.</p>

<p>"El Borak!"</p>

<p>The pass was filled with shouting. Dimly Brent saw half a dozen
horsemen sweep into view: He heard Gordon yell:</p>

<p>"Yar Ali Khan! You saw my signal after all! Give them a
volley!"</p>

<p>The banging of their rifles filled the pass with thunder. Brent,
twisting his head painfully, saw the demoralization of the Black
Tigers. He saw men falling from their saddles, others spurring back
down the canyon. Wearied from the long chase, disheartened by the
fall of their emir, fearful of a trap, the tired men on tired
horses fell back out of range.</p>

<p>Brent was aware of Gordon bending over him, heard him tell the
tall Afridi he called Yar Ali Khan to see to the others; heard Yar
Ali Khan say they were all dead. Then, as in a dream, Brent felt
himself lifted into a saddle, with a man behind to hold him on.
Wind blew his hair, and he realized they were galloping. The walls
gave back the ring of the flying hoofs, and then they were through
the pass, and galloping down the long slope beyond. He saw Gordon
riding near him, on the steed of an Afridi who had mounted before a
comrade. And before Brent fainted from sheer exhaustion, he heard
Gordon say:</p>

<p>"Let them follow us now if they will; they'll never catch us on
their worn-out nags, not in a thousand years!"</p>

<p>And Brent sank into the grateful oblivion of senselessness with
his laughter ringing in his ears&mdash;the iron, elemental,
indomitable laughter of El Borak.</p>
