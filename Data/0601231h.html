<br>
  <p class="first">"WHEW!" whistled "Ham" Hammond, staring through the right
  forward observation port. "What a place for a honeymoon!"</p>

  <p>"Then you shouldn't have married a biologist," remarked Mrs. Hammond over
  his shoulder, but he could see her gray eyes dancing in the glass of the
  port. "Nor an explorer's daughter," she added. For Pat Hammond, until her
  marriage to Ham a scant four weeks ago, had been Patricia Burlingame,
  daughter of the great Englishman who had won so much of the twilight zone of
  Venus for Britain, exactly as Crowly had done for the United States.</p>

  <p>"I didn't," observed Ham, "marry a biologist. I married a girl who
  happened to be interested in biology; that's all. It's one of her few
  drawbacks."</p>

  <p>He cut the blast to the underjets, and the rocket settled down gently on a
  cushion of flame toward the black landscape below. Slowly, carefully, he
  dropped the unwieldy mechanism until there was the faintest perceptible jar;
  then he killed the blast suddenly, the floor beneath them tilted slightly,
  and a strange silence fell like a blanket after the cessation of the roaring
  blast.</p>

  <p>"We're here," he announced.</p>

  <p>"So we are," agreed Pat. "Where's here?"</p>

  <p>"It's a point exactly seventy-five miles east of the Barrier opposite
  Venoble, in the British Cool Country. To the north is, I suppose, the
  continuation of the Mountains of Eternity, and to the south is Heaven knows
  what. And this last applies to the east."</p>

  <p>"Which is a good technical description of nowhere." Pat laughed. "Let's
  turn off the lights and look at nowhere."</p>

  <p>She did, and in the darkness the ports showed as faintly luminous
  circles.</p>

  <p>"I suggest," she proceeded, "that the Joint Expedition ascend to the dome
  for a less restricted view. We're here to investigate; let's do a little
  investigating."</p>

  <p>"This joint of the expedition agrees," chuckled Ham.</p>

  <p>He grinned in the darkness at the flippancy with which Pat approached the
  serious business of exploration. Here they were, the Joint Expedition of the
  Royal Society and the Smithsonian Institute for the Investigation of
  Conditions on the Dark Side of Venus, to use the full official title.</p>

  <p>Of course Ham himself, while technically the American half of the project,
  was in reality a member only because Pat wouldn't consider anything else; but
  she was the one to whom the bearded society and institute members addressed
  their questions, their terms, and their instructions.</p>

  <p>And this was no more than fair, for Pat, after all, was the leading
  authority on Hotland flora and fauna, and, moreover, the first human child
  born on Venus, while Ham was only an engineer lured originally to the
  Venusian frontier by a dream of quick wealth in <i>xixtchil</i> trading in
  the Hotlands.</p>

  <p>It was there he had met Patricia Burlingame, and there, after an
  adventurous journey to the foothills of the Mountains of Eternity, that he
  had won her. They had been married in Erotia, the American settlement, less
  than a month ago, and then had come the offer of the expedition to the dark
  side.</p>

  <p>Ham had argued against it. He had wanted a good terrestrial honeymoon in
  New York or London, but there were difficulties. Primarily there was the
  astronomical one; Venus was past perigee, and it would be eight long months
  before its slow swing around the Sun brought it back to a point where a
  rocket could overtake the Earth. Eight months in primitive, frontier-built
  Erotia, or in equally primitive Venoble, if they chose the British
  settlement, with no amusement save hunting, no radio, no plays, even very few
  books. And if they must hunt, Pat argued, why not add the thrill and danger
  of the unknown?</p>

  <p>No one knew what life, if any, lurked on the dark side of the planet; very
  few had even seen it, and those few from rockets speeding over vast mountain
  ranges or infinite frozen oceans. Here was a chance to explain the mystery,
  and explore it, expenses paid.</p>

  <p>It took a multimillionaire to build and equip a private rocket, but the
  Royal Society and the Smithsonian Institute, spending government money, were
  above such considerations. There'd be danger, perhaps, and breathtaking
  thrills, but&mdash;they could be alone.</p>

  <p>The last point had won Ham. So they had spent two busy weeks provisioning
  and equipping the rocket, had ridden high above the ice barrier that bounds
  the twilight zone, and dashed frantically through the storm line, where the
  cold Underwind from the sunless side meets the hot Upper Winds that sweep
  from the desert face of the planet.</p>

  <p>For Venus, of course, has no rotation, and hence no alternate days and
  nights. One face is forever sunlit, and one forever dark, and only the
  planet's slow liberation gives the twilight zone a semblance of seasons. And
  this twilight zone, the only habitable part of the planet, merges through the
  Hotlands on one side to the blazing desert, and on the other side ends
  abruptly in the ice barrier where the Upper Winds yield their moisture to the
  chilling breaths of the Underwind.</p>

  <p>So here they were, crowded into the tiny glass dome above the navigation
  panel, standing close together on the top rung of the ladder, and with just
  room in the dome for both their heads. Ham slipped his arm around the girl as
  they stared at the scene outside.</p>

  <p>Away off to the west was the eternal dawn&mdash;or sunset, perhaps
  &mdash;where the light glistened on the ice barrier. Like vast columns, the
  Mountains of Eternity thrust themselves against the light, with their mighty
  peaks lost in the lower clouds twenty-five miles above. There, a little
  south, were the ramparts of the Lesser Eternities, bounding American Venus,
  and between the two ranges were the perpetual lightnings of the storm
  line.</p>

  <p>But around them, illuminated dimly by the refraction of the sunlight, was
  a scene of dark and wild splendor. Everywhere was ice&mdash;hills of it,
  spires, plains, boulders, and cliffs of it, all glowing a pallid green in the
  trickle of light from beyond the barrier. A world without motion, frozen and
  sterile, save for the moaning of the Underwind outside, not hindered here as
  the barrier shielded it from the Cool Country.</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;glorious!" Pat murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "but cold, lifeless, yet menacing. Pat, do you think
  there is life here?"</p>

  <p>"I should judge so. If life can exist on such worlds as Titan and Iapetus,
  it should exist here. How cold is it?" She glanced at the thermometer outside
  the dome, its column and figures self-luminous. "Only thirty below zero,
  Fahrenheit. Life exists on Earth at that temperature."</p>

  <p>"Exists, yes. But it couldn't have developed at a temperature below
  freezing. Life has to be lived in liquid water."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly. "You're talking to a biologist, Ham. No; life couldn't
  have <i>evolved</i> at thirty below zero, but suppose it originated back in
  the twilight zone and migrated here? Or suppose it was pushed here by the
  terrific competition of the warmer regions? <i>You</i> know what conditions
  are in the Hotlands, with the molds and doughpots and Jack Ketch trees, and
  the millions of little parasitic things, all eating each other."</p>

  <p>He considered this. "What sort of life should you expect?"</p>

  <p>She chuckled. "Do you want a prediction? Very well. I'd guess, first of
  all, some sort of vegetation as a base, for animal life can't keep eating
  itself without some added fuel. It's like the story of the man with the cat
  farm, who raised rats to feed the cats, and then when he skinned the cats, he
  fed the bodies to the rats, and then fed more rats to the cats. It sounds
  good, but it won't work."</p>

  <p>"So there ought to be vegetation. Then what?"</p>

  <p>"Then? Heaven knows. Presumably the dark side life, if it exists, came
  originally from the weaker strains of twilight-zone life, but what it might
  have become&mdash;well, I can't guess. Of course, there's the <i>triops
  noctivivans</i> that I discovered in the Mountains of Eternity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> discovered!" He grinned. "You were out as cold as ice when I
  carried you away from the nest of devils. You never even saw one!"</p>

  <p>"I examined the dead one brought into Venoble by the hunters," she
  returned imperturbably. "And don't forget that the society wanted to name it
  after me&mdash;the <i>triops Patrici&aelig;</i>". Involuntarily a shudder
  shook her at the memory of those satanic creatures that had all but destroyed
  the two of them. "But I chose the other name&mdash;<i>triops noctivivans</i>,
  the three-eyed dweller in the dark."</p>

  <p>"Romantic name for a devilish beast!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but what I was getting at is this&mdash;that it's probable that
  triops&mdash;or triopses&mdash;Say, what is the plural of triops?"</p>

  <p>"Trioptes," he grunted. "Latin root."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's probable that trioptes, then, are among the creatures to be
  found here on the night side, and that those fierce devils who attacked us in
  that shadowed canyon in the Mountains of Eternity are an outpost, creeping
  into the twilight zone through the dark and sunless passes in the mountains.
  They can't stand light; you saw that yourself."</p>

  <p>"So what?"</p>

  <p>Pat laughed at the Americanism. "So this: From their form and structure
  &mdash;six limbs, three eyes, and all&mdash;it's plain that the trioptes are
  related to ordinary native Hotlanders. Therefore I conclude that they're
  recent arrivals on the dark side; that they didn't evolve here, but were
  driven here quite lately, geologically speaking. Or geologically isn't quite
  the word, because <i>geos</i> means earth. <i>Venusologically</i> speaking, I
  should say."</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't say. You're substituting a Latin root for a Greek one. What
  you mean is aphrodisiologically speaking."</p>

  <p>She chuckled again. "What I mean, and should have said right away to avoid
  argument, is pal&aelig;ontologically speaking, which is better English.
  Anyway, I mean that trioptes haven't existed on the dark side for more than
  twenty to fifty thousand Earth years, or maybe less, because what do we know
  about the speed of evolution on Venus? Perhaps it's faster than on the Earth;
  maybe a triops could adapt itself to night life in five thousand."</p>

  <p>"I've seen college students adapt themselves to night life in one
  semester!" He grinned.</p>

  <p>She ignored this. "And therefore," she proceeded, "I argue that there must
  have been life here before triops arrived, since it must have found something
  to eat when it got here or it couldn't have survived. And since my
  examination showed that it's partly a carnivorous feeder, there must have
  been not only life here, but animal life. And that's as far as pure reason
  can carry the argument."</p>

  <p>"So you can't guess what sort of animal life. Intelligent, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It might be. But in spite of the way you Yankees worship
  intelligence, biologically it's unimportant. It hasn't even much survival
  value."</p>

  <p>"What? How can you say that, Pat? What except human intelligence has given
  man the supremacy of the Earth&mdash;and of Venus, too, for that matter?"</p>

  <p>"But <i>has</i> man the supremacy of the Earth? Look here, Ham, here's
  what I mean about intelligence. A gorilla has a far better brain than a
  turtle, hasn't it? And yet which is the more successful&mdash;the gorilla,
  which is rare and confined only to a small region in Africa, or the turtle,
  which is common everywhere from the arctic to the antarctic? And as for man
  &mdash;well, if you had microscopic eyes, and could see every living thing on
  the Earth, you'd decide that man was just a rare specimen, and that the
  planet was really a nematode world&mdash;that is, a worm world&mdash;because
  the nematodes far outnumber all the other forms of life put together."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't supremacy, Pat."</p>

  <p>"I didn't say it was. I merely said that intelligence hasn't much survival
  value. If it has, why are the insects that have no intelligence, but just
  instinct, giving the human race such a battle? Men have better brains than
  corn borers, boll weevils, fruit flies, Japanese beetles, gypsy moths, and
  all the other pests, and yet they match our intelligence with just one weapon
  &mdash;their enormous fecundity. Do you realize that every time a child is
  born, until it's balanced by a death, it can be fed in only one way? And that
  way is by taking the food away from the child's own weight of insects."</p>

  <p>"All that sounds reasonable enough, but what's it got to do with
  intelligence on the dark side of Venus?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Pat, and her voice took on a queer tinge of
  nervousness. "I just mean&mdash;Look at it this way, Ham. A lizard is more
  intelligent than a fish, but not enough to give it any advantage. Then
  <i>why</i> did the lizard and its descendants keep on developing
  intelligence? Why&mdash;unless all life tends to become intelligent in time?
  And if that's true, then there may be intelligence even here&mdash;strange,
  alien, incomprehensible intelligence."</p>

  <p>She shivered in the dark against him. "Never mind," she said in suddenly
  altered tones. "It's probably just fancy. The world out there is so weird, so
  unearthly&mdash;I'm tired, Ham. It's been a long day."</p>

  <p>He followed her down into the body of the rocket. As the lights flicked on
  the strange landscape beyond the ports was blotted out, and he saw only Pat,
  very lovely in the scanty costume of the Cool Country.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, then," he said. "We've food for three weeks."</p>

  <p>To-morrow, of course, meant only time and not daylight. They rose to the
  same darkness that had always blanketed the sunless half of Venus, with the
  same eternal sunset green on the horizon at the barrier. But Pat was in
  better humor, and went eagerly about the preparations for their first venture
  into the open. She brought out the parkas of inch-thick wool sheathed in
  rubber, and Ham, in his capacity as engineer, carefully inspected the hoods,
  each with its crown of powerful lamps.</p>

  <p>These were primarily for vision, of course, but they had another purpose.
  It was known that the incredibly fierce trioptes could not face light, and
  thus, by using all four beams in the helmet, one could move, surrounded by a
  protective aura. But that did not prevent both of them from including in
  their equipment two blunt blue automatics and a pair of the terrifically
  destructive flame pistols. And Pat carried a bag at her belt, into which she
  proposed to drop specimens of any dark-side flora she encountered, and fauna,
  too, if it proved small and harmless enough.</p>

  <p>They grinned at each other through their masks. "Makes you look fat,"
  observed Ham maliciously, and enjoyed her sniff of annoyance.</p>

  <p>She turned, threw open the door, and stamped into the open.</p>

  <p>It was different from looking out through a port. Then the scene had some
  of the unreality and all of the immobility and silence of a picture, but now
  it was actually around them, and the cold breath and mournful voice of the
  Underwind proved definitely enough that the world was real. For a moment they
  stood in the circlet of light from the rocket ports, staring awe-struck at
  the horizon where the unbelievable peaks of the Greater Eternities towered
  black against the false sunset.</p>

  <p>Nearer, for as far as vision reached through that sunless, moonless,
  starless region, was a desolate tumbled plain where peaks, minarets, spires,
  and ridges of ice and stone rose in indescribable and fantastic shapes,
  carved by the wild artistry of the Underwind.</p>

  <p>Ham slipped a padded arm around Pat, and was surprised to feel her shiver.
  "Cold?" he asked, glancing at the dial thermometer on his wrist. "It's only
  thirty-six below."</p>

  <p>"I'm not cold," replied Pat. "It's the scenery; that's all." She moved
  away. "I wonder what keeps the place as warm as it is. Without sunlight you'd
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then you'd be wrong," cut in Ham. "Any engineer knows that gases diffuse.
  The Upper Winds are going by just five or six miles over our heads, and they
  naturally carry a lot of heat from the desert beyond the twilight zone.
  There's some diffusion of the warm air into the cold, and then, besides, as
  the warm winds cool, they tend to sink. And what's more, the contour of the
  country has a lot to do with it."</p>

  <p>He paused. "Say," he went on reflectively, "I shouldn't be surprised if we
  found sections near the Eternities where there was a down draft, where the
  Upper Winds slid right along the slope and gave certain places a fairly
  bearable climate."</p>

  <p>He followed Pat as she poked around the boulders near the edge of the
  circle of light from the rocket.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" she exclaimed. "There it is, Ham! There's our specimen of darkside
  plant life."</p>

  <p>She bent over a gray bulbous mass, "Lichenous or fungoid," she continued.
  "No leaves, of course; leaves are only useful in sunlight. No chlorophyll for
  the same reason. A very primitive, very simple plant, and yet&mdash;in some
  ways&mdash;not simple at all. Look, Ham&mdash;a highly developed circulatory
  system!"</p>

  <p>He leaned closer, and in the dim yellow light from the ports he saw the
  fine tracery of veins she indicated.</p>

  <p>"That," she proceeded, "would indicate a sort of heart and&mdash;I
  wonder!" Abruptly she thrust her dial thermometer against the fleshy mass,
  held it there a moment, and then peered at it. "Yes! Look how the needle's
  moved, Ham. It's warm! A warm-blooded plant. And when you think of it, it's
  only natural, because that's the one sort of plant that could live in a
  region forever below freezing. Life <i>must</i> be lived in liquid
  water."</p>

  <p>She tugged at the thing, and with a sullen plump it came free, and dark
  driblets of liquid welled out of the torn root.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Ham. "What a disgusting thing! 'And tore the bleeding
  mandragora,' eh? Only they were supposed to scream when you uprooted
  them."</p>

  <p>He paused. A low, pulsing, wailing whimper came out of the quivering mass
  of pulp, and he turned a startled gaze on Pat. "Ugh!" he grunted again.
  "Disgusting!"</p>

  <p>"Disgusting? Why, it's a beautiful organism! It's adapted perfectly to its
  environment."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad I'm an engineer," he growled, watching Pat as she opened
  the rocket's door and laid the thing on a square of rubber within. "Come on.
  Let's look around."</p>

  <p>Pat closed the door and followed him away from the rocket. Instantly the
  night folded in around them like a black mist, and it was only by glancing
  back at the lighted ports that Pat could convince herself that they stood in
  a real world.</p>

  <p>"Should we light our helmet lamps?" asked Ham. "We'd better, I suppose, or
  risk a fall."</p>

  <p>Before either could move farther, a sound struck through the moaning of
  the Underwind, a wild, fierce, unearthly shrieking like laughter in hell,
  hoots and howls and mirthless chuckling noises.</p>

  <p>"It's triops!" gasped Pat, forgetting plurals and grammar alike.</p>

  <p>She was frightened; ordinarily she was as courageous as Ham, and rather
  more reckless and daring, but those uncanny shrieks brought back the moments
  of torment when they had been trapped in the canyon in the Mountains of
  Eternity. She was badly frightened and fumbled frantically and ineffectually
  at light switch and revolver.</p>

  <p>Just as half a dozen stones hummed fast as bullets around them, and one
  crashed painfully on Ham's arm, he flicked on his lights. Four beams shot in
  a long cross on the glittering peaks, and the wild laughter rose in a
  crescendo of pain. He had a momentary glimpse of shadowy figures flinging
  themselves from pinnacle and ridge, flitting specterlike into the darkness,
  and then silence.</p>

  <p>"O-o-oh!" murmured Pat. "I&mdash;was scared, Ham." She huddled against
  him, then continued more strongly: "But there's proof. <i>Triops
  noctivivans</i>actually is a night-side creature, and those in the mountains
  are outposts or fragments that've wandered into the sunless chasms."</p>

  <p>Far off sounded the hooting laughter. "I wonder," mused Ham, "if that
  noise of their's is in the nature of a language."</p>

  <p>"Very probably. After all, the Hotland natives are intelligent, and these
  creatures are a related species. Besides, they throw stones, and they know
  the use of those smothering pods they showered on us in the canyon&mdash;
  which, by the way, must be the fruit of some night-side plant. The trioptes
  are doubtless intelligent in a fierce, blood-thirsty, barbaric fashion, but
  the beasts are so unapproachable that I doubt if human beings ever learn much
  of their minds or language."</p>

  <p>Ham agreed emphatically, the more so as a viciously cast rock suddenly
  chipped glittering particles from an icy spire a dozen paces away. He twisted
  his head, sending the beams of his helmet lamps angling over the plain, and a
  single shrill cachinnation drifted out of the dark.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven the lights keep 'em fairly out of range," he muttered.
  "These are pleasant little subjects of his majesty,[1] aren't they? God save
  the king if he had many more like 'em!"</p>

  <p>[Footnote 1: They were on British territory, being in the latitude of
  Venoble. The International Congress at Lisle had in 2020 apportioned the
  dark-side rights by giving to each nation owning Venusian possessions a wedge
  extending from the twilight zone to a point on the planet directly opposite
  the Sun in mid-autumn.]</p>

  <p>But Pat was again engaged in her search for specimens. She had switched on
  her lamps now, and scrambled agilely in and out among the fantastic monuments
  of that bizarre plain. Ham followed her, watching as she wrenched up bleeding
  and whimpering vegetation. She found a dozen varieties, and one little
  wriggling cigar-shaped creature that she gazed at in perplexity, quite unable
  to determine whether it was plant, animal, or neither. And at last her
  specimen bag was completely filled, and they turned back over the plain
  toward the rocket, whose ports gleamed afar like a row of staring eyes.</p>

  <p>But a shock awaited them as they opened the door to enter. Both of them
  started back at the gust of warm, stuffy, putrid, and unbreathable air that
  gushed into their faces with an odor of carrion.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;" gasped Ham, and then laughed. "Your mandragora!" He
  chuckled. "Look at it!"</p>

  <p>The plant she had placed within was a mass of decayed corruption. In the
  warmth of the interior it had decomposed rapidly and completely and was now
  but a semiliquid heap on the rubber mat. She pulled it through the entrance
  and flung mat and all away.</p>

  <p>They clambered into an interior still reeking, and Ham set a ventilator
  spinning. The air that came in was cold, of course, but pure with the breath
  of the Underwind, sterile and dustless from its sweep across five thousand
  miles of frozen oceans and mountains. He swung the door closed, set a heater
  going, and dropped his visor to grin at Pat.</p>

  <p>"So that's your beautiful organism!" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"It was. It <i>was</i> a beautiful organism, Ham. You can't blame it
  because we exposed it to temperatures it was never supposed to encounter."
  She sighed and slung her specimen pouch to the table. "I'll have to prepare
  these at once, I suppose, since they don't keep."</p>

  <p>Ham grunted and set about the preparation of a meal, working with the
  expert touch of a true Hotlander. He glanced at Pat as she bent over her
  specimens, injecting the bichloride solution.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose," he asked, "that the triops is the highest form of life
  on the dark side?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond doubt," replied Pat. "If any higher form existed, it would long
  ago have exterminated those fierce devils."</p>

  <p>But she was utterly wrong.</p>

  <p>Within the span of four days they had exhausted the possibilities of the
  tumbled plain around the rocket. Pat had accumulated a variegated group of
  specimens, and Ham had taken an endless series of observations on
  temperature, on magnetic variations, on the direction and velocity of the
  Underwind.</p>

  <p>So they moved their base, and the rocket flared into flight southward,
  toward the region where, presumably, the vast and mysterious Mountains of
  Eternity towered across the ice barrier into the dusky world of the night
  side. They flew slowly, throttling the reaction motors to a bare fifty miles
  an hour, for they were flying through night, depending on the beam of the
  forward light to warn against looming peaks.</p>

  <p>Twice they halted, and each time a day or two sufficed to indicate that
  the region was similar to that of their first base. The same veined and
  bulbous plants, the same eternal Underwind, the same laughter from
  blood-thirsty trioptic throats.</p>

  <p>But on the third occasion, there was a difference. They came to rest on a
  wild and bleak plateau among the foothills of the Greater Eternities. Far
  away to the westward, half the horizon still glowed green with the false
  sunset, but the whole span south of the due-west point was black, hidden from
  view by the vast ramparts of the range that soared twenty-five miles above
  them into the black heavens. The mountains were invisible, of course, in that
  region of endless night, but the two in the rocket felt the colossal nearness
  of those incredible peaks.</p>

  <p>And there was another way in which the mighty presence of the Mountains of
  Eternity affected them. The region was warm&mdash;not warm by the standards
  of the twilight zone, but much warmer than the plain below. Their
  thermometers showed zero on one side of the rocket, five above on the other.
  The vast peaks, ascending into the level of the Upper Winds, set up eddies
  and stray currents that brought warm air down to temper the cold breath of
  the Underwind.</p>

  <p>Ham stared gloomily over the plateau visible in the lights. "I don't like
  it," he grunted. "I never did like these mountains, not since you made a fool
  of yourself by trying to cross 'em back in the Cool Country."</p>

  <p>"A fool!" echoed Pat. "Who named these mountains? Who crossed them? Who
  discovered them? My father, that's who!"</p>

  <p>"And so you thought you inherited 'em," he retorted, "and that all you had
  to do was to whistle and they'd lie down and play dead, and Madman's Pass
  would turn into a park walk. With the result that you'd now be a heap of
  clean-picked bones in a canyon if I hadn't been around to carry you out of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're just a timid Yankee!" she snapped. "I'm going outside to have
  a look." She pulled on her parka and stepped to the door, and there paused.
  "Aren't you&mdash;aren't you coming, too?" she asked hesitantly.</p>

  <p>He grinned. "Sure! I just wanted to hear you ask." He slipped into his own
  outdoor garb and followed.</p>

  <p>There was a difference here. Outwardly the plateau presented the same
  bleak wilderness of ice and stone that they had found on the plain below.
  There were wind-eroded pinnacles of the utmost fantasy of form, and the wild
  landscape that glittered in the beams from their helmet lamps was the same
  bizarre terrain that they had first encountered.</p>

  <p>But the cold was less bitter here; strangely, increasing altitude on this
  curious planet brought warmth instead of cold, as on the Earth, because it
  raised one closer to the region of the Upper Winds, and here in the Mountains
  of Eternity the Underwind howled less persistently, broken into gusts by the
  mighty peaks.</p>

  <p>And the vegetation was less sparse. Everywhere were the veined and bulbous
  masses, and Ham had to tread carefully lest he repeat the unpleasant
  experience of stepping on one and hearing its moaning whimper of pain. Pat
  had no such scruples, insisting that the whimper was but a tropism; that the
  specimens she pulled up and dissected felt no more pain than an apple that
  was eaten; and that, anyway, it was a biologist's business to be a
  biologist.</p>

  <p>Somewhere off among the peaks shrilled the mocking laughter of a triops,
  and in the shifting shadows at the extremities of their beams, Ham imagined
  more than once that he saw the forms of these demons of the dark. If there
  they were, however, the light kept them at a safe distance, for no stones
  hummed past.</p>

  <p>Yet it was a queer sensation to walk thus in the center of a moving circle
  of light; he felt continually as if just beyond the boundary of visibility
  lurked Heaven only knew what weird and incredible creatures, though reason
  argued that such monsters couldn't have remained undetected.</p>

  <p>Ahead of them their beams glistened on an icy rampart, a bank or cliff
  that stretched right and left across their course.</p>

  <p>Pat gestured suddenly toward it. "Look there!" she exclaimed, holding her
  light steady. "Caves in the ice&mdash;burrows, rather. See?"</p>

  <p>He saw&mdash;little black openings as large, perhaps, as a manhole cover,
  a whole row of them at the base of the ice rampart. Something black skittered
  laughing up the glassy slope and away&mdash;a triops. Were these the dens of
  the beasts? He squinted sharply.</p>

  <p>"Something's there!" he muttered to Pat. "Look! Half the openings have
  something in front of them&mdash;or are those just rocks to block the
  entrance?"</p>

  <p>Cautiously, revolvers in hand, they advanced. There was no more motion,
  but in the growing intensity of the beams, the objects were less and less
  rocklike, and at last they could make out the veinings and fleshy bulbousness
  of life.</p>

  <p>At least the creatures were a new variety. Now Ham could distinguish a row
  of eyelike spots, and now a multiplicity of legs beneath them. The things
  were like inverted bushel baskets, about the size and contour, veined,
  flabby, and featureless save for a complete circle of eye spots. And now he
  could even see the semitransparent lids that closed, apparently, to shield
  the eyes from the pain of their lights.</p>

  <p>They were barely a dozen feet from one of the creatures. Pat, after a
  moment of hesitation, moved directly before the motionless mystery.</p>

  <p>"Well!" she said. "Here's a new one, Ham. Hello, old fella!"</p>

  <p>An instant later both of them were frozen in utter consternation,
  completely overwhelmed by bewilderment, amazement, and confusion. Issuing, it
  seemed, from a membrane at the top of the creature, came a clicking, high-
  pitched voice.</p>

  <p>"Hello, fella!" it said.</p>

  <p>There was an appalled silence. Ham held his revolver, but had there been
  need, he couldn't have used it, nor even remembered it. He was paralyzed;
  stricken dumb.</p>

  <p>But Pat found her voice. "It&mdash;isn't real," she said faintly. "It's a
  tropism. The thing just echoed whatever sounds strike it. Doesn't it, Ham?
  Doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;of course!" He was staring at the lidded eyes. "It must
  be. Listen!" He leaned forward and yelled, "Hello!" directly at the creature.
  "It'll answer."</p>

  <p>It did. "It isn't a tropism," it clicked in shrill but perfect
  English.</p>

  <p>"<i>That's</i> no echo!" gasped Pat. She backed away. "I'm scared," she
  whimpered, pulling at Ham's arm. "Come away&mdash;quick!"</p>

  <p>He thrust her behind him. "I'm just a timid Yankee," he grunted, "but I'm
  going to cross-question this living phonograph until I find out what&mdash;
  or who makes it tick."</p>

  <p>"No! No, Ham! I'm scared!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look dangerous," he observed.</p>

  <p>"It isn't dangerous," remarked the thing on the ice.</p>

  <p>Ham gulped, and Pat gave a horrified little moan.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" he faltered.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. The lidded eyes stared steadily at him.</p>

  <p>"What are you?" he tried again.</p>

  <p>Again no reply.</p>

  <p>"How do you know English?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>The clicking voice sounded: "I isn't know English."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;uh&mdash;then why do you speak English?"</p>

  <p>"You speak English," explained the mystery, logically enough.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean why. I mean <i>how?</i>"</p>

  <p>But Pat had overcome a part of her terrified astonishment, and her quick
  mind perceived a clue. "Ham," she whispered tensely, "it uses the words we
  use. It gets the meaning from us!"</p>

  <p>"I gets the meaning from you," confirmed the thing ungrammatically.</p>

  <p>Light dawned on Ham. "Lord!" he gasped. "Then it's up to us to give it a
  vocabulary."</p>

  <p>"You speak, I speak," suggested the creature.</p>

  <p>"Sure! See, Pat? We can say just anything." He paused. "Let's see&mdash;"
  "When in the course of human events it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped Pat. "Yankee! You're on crown territory now. 'To be or
  not to be; that is the question just&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>Ham grinned and was silent. When she had exhausted her memory, he took up
  the task: "Once upon a time there were three bears&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And so it went. Suddenly the situation struck him as fantastically
  ridiculous&mdash;there was Pat carefully relating the story of Little Red
  Riding Hood to a humorless monstrosity of the night-side of Venus! The girl
  cast him a perplexed glance as he roared into a gale of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Tell him the one about the traveling man and the farmer's daughter!" he
  said, choking. "See if you can get a smile from him!"</p>

  <p>She joined his laughter. "But it's really a serious matter," she
  concluded. "Imagine it, Ham! Intelligent life on the dark side! Or <i>are
  you</i> intelligent?" she asked suddenly of the thing on the ice.</p>

  <p>"I am intelligent," it assured her. "I'm intelligently intelligent."</p>

  <p>"At least you're a marvelous linguist," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of learning English in half an hour, Ham? Think of
  that!" Apparently her fear of the creature had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Well; let's make use of it," suggested Ham. "What's your name, friend?"
  There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"Of course," put in Pat. "He can't tell us his name until we give it to
  him in English, and we can't do that because&mdash;Oh, well, let's call him
  Oscar, then. That'll serve."</p>

  <p>"Good enough. Oscar, what are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Human, I'm a man."</p>

  <p>"Eh? I'll be damned if you are!"</p>

  <p>"Those are the words you've given me. To me I am a man to you."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment. 'To me I am&mdash;' I see, Pat. He means that the only
  words we have for what he considers himself are words like man and human.
  Well, what are your people, then?"</p>

  <p>"People."</p>

  <p>"I mean your race. What race do you belong to?"</p>

  <p>"Human."</p>

  <p>"Owl" groaned Ham. "You try, Pat."</p>

  <p>"Oscar," said the girl, "you say you're human. Are you a mammal?"</p>

  <p>"To me man is a mammal to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, good heavens!" She tried again. "Oscar, how does your race
  reproduce?"</p>

  <p>"I have not the words."</p>

  <p>"Are you born?"</p>

  <p>The queer face, or faceless body, of the creature changed slightly.
  Heavier lids dropped over the semi-transparent ones that shielded its many
  eyes; it was almost as if the thing frowned in concentration.</p>

  <p>"We are not born," he clicked.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;seeds, spores, parthenogenesis? Or fissure?"</p>

  <p>"Spores," shrilled the mystery, "and fissure."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused, nonplussed. In the momentary silence came the mocking hoot of
  a triops far to their left, and both turned involuntarily, stared, and
  recoiled aghast. At the very extremity of their beam one of the laughing
  demons had seized and was bearing away what was beyond doubt one of the
  creatures of the caves. And to add to the horror, all the rest squatted in
  utter indifference before their burrows.</p>

  <p>"Oscar!" Pat screamed. "They got one of you!"</p>

  <p>She broke off suddenly at the crack of Ham's revolver, but it was a futile
  shot.</p>

  <p>"O-oh!" she gasped. "The devils! They got one!" There was no comment at
  all from the creature before them. "Oscar," she cried, "don't you care? They
  murdered one of you! Don't you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;doesn't it affect you at all?" The creatures had come, somehow,
  to hold a sort of human sympathy in Pat's mind. They could talk; they were
  more than beasts. "Don't you care at all?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But what are those devils to you? What do they do that you let them
  murder you?"</p>

  <p>"They eat us," said Oscar placidly.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" gasped Pat in horror. "But&mdash;but why don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off; the creature was backing slowly and methodically into its
  burrow.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she cried. "They can't come here! Our lights&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The clicking voice drifted out: "It is cold. I go because of the
  cold."</p>

  <p>There was silence.</p>

  <p>It was colder. The gusty Underwind moaned more steadily now, and glancing
  along the ridge, Pat saw that every one of the cave creatures was slipping
  like Oscar into his burrow. She turned a helpless gaze on Ham.</p>

  <p>"Did I&mdash;dream this?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Then both of us dreamed it, Pat." He took her arm and drew her back
  toward the rocket, whose round ports glowed an invitation through the
  dusk.</p>

  <p>But once in the warm interior, with her clumsy outer garments removed, Pat
  drew her dainty legs under her, lighted a cigarette, and fell to more
  rational consideration of the mystery.</p>

  <p>"There's something we don't understand about this, Ham. Did you sense
  anything queer about Oscar's mind?"</p>

  <p>"It's a devilishly quick one!"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he's intelligent enough. Intelligence of the human level, or even"
  &mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"above the human. But it isn't a human mind. It's
  different, somehow&mdash;alien, strange. I can't quite express what I felt,
  but did you notice Oscar never asked a question? Not one!"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;he didn't, did he? That's queer!"</p>

  <p>"It's darn queer. Any human intelligence, meeting another thinking form of
  life, would ask plenty of questions. We did." She blew a thoughtful puff of
  smoke. "And that isn't all. That&mdash;that indifference of his when the
  triops attacked his fellow&mdash;was that human, or even earthly? I've seen a
  hunting spider snatch one fly from a swarm of them without disturbing the
  rest, but could that happen to intelligent creatures? It couldn't; not even
  to brains as undeveloped as those in a herd of deer, or a flock of sparrows.
  Kill one and you frighten all."</p>

  <p>"That's true, Pat. They're damn queer ducks, these fellow citizens of
  Oscar's. Queer animals."</p>

  <p>"Animals? Don't tell me you didn't notice, Ham!"</p>

  <p>"Notice what?"</p>

  <p>"Oscar's no animal. He's a plant&mdash;a warm-blooded, mobile vegetable!
  All the time we were talking to him he was rooting around below him with his
  &mdash;well, his root. And those things that looked like legs&mdash;they were
  pods. He didn't walk on them; he dragged himself on his root. And what's more
  he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What's more?"</p>

  <p>"What's more, Ham, those pods were the same sort as the ones that the
  triops threw at us in the canyon of the Mountains of Eternity, the ones that
  choked and smothered us so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The ones that laid you out so cold, you mean."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I had wits enough to notice them!" she retorted, flushing. "But
  there's part of the mystery, Ham. Oscar's mind is a vegetable mind!" She
  paused, puffing her cigarette as he packed his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose," she asked suddenly, "that the presence of Oscar and his
  crew represents a menace to human occupancy of Venus? I know they're
  dark-side creatures, but what if mines are discovered here? What if there
  turns out to be a field for commercial exploitation? Humans can't live
  indefinitely away from sunlight, I know, but there might be a need for
  temporary colonies here, and what then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, what then?" rejoined Ham.</p>

  <p>"Yes; what then? Is there room on the same planet for two intelligent
  races? Won't there be a conflict of interests sooner or later?"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" he grunted. "Those things are primitive, Pat. They live in
  caves, without culture, without weapons. They're no danger to man."</p>

  <p>"But they're magnificently intelligent. How do you know that these we've
  seen aren't just a barbaric tribe and that somewhere on the vastness of the
  dark side there isn't a vegetable civilization? You know civilization isn't
  the personal prerogative of mankind, because look at the mighty decadent
  culture on Mars and the dead remnants on Titan. Man has simply happened to
  have the strangest brand of it, at least so far."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough, Pat," he agreed. "But if Oscar's fellows aren't any
  more pugnacious than they were toward that murderous triops, then they aren't
  much of a menace."</p>

  <p>She shuddered. "I can't understand that at all. I wonder if&mdash;" She
  paused, frowning.</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't know. I had an idea&mdash;a rather horrible idea." She
  looked up suddenly. "Ham, to-morrow I'm going to find out exactly how
  intelligent Oscar really is. Exactly how intelligent&mdash;if I can."</p>

  <p>There were certain difficulties, however. When Ham and Pat approached the
  ice ridge, plodding across the fantastic terrain, they found themselves in
  utter perplexity as to which of the row of caves was the one before which
  they had stood in conversation with Oscar. In the glittering reflections from
  their lamps each opening appeared exactly like every other, and the creatures
  at their mouths stared at them with lidded eyes in which there was no
  readable expression.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Pat in puzzlement, "we'll just have to try. You there, are
  you Oscar?"</p>

  <p>The clicking voice sounded: "Yes."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," objected Ham. "He was over more to the right. Hey!
  Are you Oscar?"</p>

  <p>Another voice clicked: "Yes."</p>

  <p>"You can't <i>both</i> be Oscar!"</p>

  <p>Pat's choice responded: "We are all Oscar."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind," cut in Pat, forestalling Ham's protests. "Apparently
  what one knows they all know, so it doesn't make any difference which we
  choose. Oscar, you said yesterday you were intelligent. Are you more
  intelligent than I am?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Much more intelligent."</p>

  <p>"Hah!" snickered Ham. "Take that, Pat!"</p>

  <p>She sniffed. "Well, that puts him miles above you, Yankee! Oscar, do you
  ever lie?"</p>

  <p>Opaque lids dropped over translucent ones. "Lie," repeated the shrill
  voice. "Lie. No. There is no need."</p>

  <p>"Well, do you&mdash;" She broke off suddenly at the sound of a dull pop.
  "What's that? Oh! Look, Ham, one of his pods burst!" She drew back.</p>

  <p>A sharply pungent odor assailed them, reminiscent of that dangerous hour
  in the canyon, but not strong enough this time to set Ham choking or send the
  girl reeling into unconsciousness. Sharp, acrid, and yet not entirely
  unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"What's that for, Oscar?"</p>

  <p>"It is so we&mdash;" The voice cut short.</p>

  <p>"Reproduce?" suggested Pat.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Reproduce. The wind carries our spores to each other. We live where
  the wind is not steady."</p>

  <p>"But yesterday you said fissure was your method."</p>

  <p>"Yes. The spores lodge against our bodies and there is a&mdash;" Again the
  voice died.</p>

  <p>"A fertilization?" suggested the girl.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, a&mdash;I know! An irritation!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That causes a tumorous growth?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. When the growth is complete, we split."</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" snorted Ham. "A tumor!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped the girl. "That's all a baby is&mdash;a normal
  tumor."</p>

  <p>"A normal&mdash;Well, I'm glad I'm not a biologist! Or a woman!"</p>

  <p>"So'm I," said Pat demurely. "Oscar, how much do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Everything."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where my people come from?"</p>

  <p>"From beyond the light."</p>

  <p>"Yes; but before that?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"We come from another planet," said the girl impressively. At Oscar's
  silence she said:-"Do you know what a planet is?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But did you know before I said the word?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Long before."</p>

  <p>"But how? Do you know what machinery is? Do you know what weapons are? Do
  you know how to make them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;why don't you?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need."</p>

  <p>"No need!" she gasped. "With light&mdash;even with fire&mdash;you could
  keep the triopses&mdash;trioptes, I mean&mdash;away. You could keep them from
  eating you!"</p>

  <p>"There is no need."</p>

  <p>She turned helplessly to Ham.</p>

  <p>"The thing's lying," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't think so," she murmured. "It's something else&mdash;
  something we don't understand. Oscar, how do you know all those things?"</p>

  <p>"Intelligence."</p>

  <p>At the next cave another pod popped sullenly.</p>

  <p>"But how? Tell me how you discover facts."</p>

  <p>"From any fact," clicked the creature on the ice, "intelligence can build
  a picture of the&mdash;" There was silence.</p>

  <p>"Universe?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The universe. I start with one fact and I reason from it. I build a
  picture of the universe. I start with another fact. I reason from it. I find
  that the universe I picture is the same as the first. I know that the picture
  is true."</p>

  <p>Both listeners stared in awe at the creature. "Say!" gulped Ham. "If
  that's true we could find out anything from Oscar! Oscar, can you tell us
  secrets that we don't know?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"You must first have the words to give me. I cannot tell you that for
  which you have no words."</p>

  <p>"It's true!" whispered Pat. "But, Oscar, I have the words time and space
  and energy and matter and law and cause. Tell me the ultimate law of the
  universe?"</p>

  <p>"It is the law of&mdash;" Silence.</p>

  <p>"Conservation of energy or matter? Gravitation?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Of&mdash;of God?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Of&mdash;life?"</p>

  <p>"No. Life is of no importance."</p>

  <p>"Of&mdash;what? I can't think of another word."</p>

  <p>"There's a chance," said Ham tensely, "that there is no word!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," clicked Oscar. "It is the law of chance. Those other words are
  different sides of the law of chance."</p>

  <p>"Good Heaven!" breathed Pat. "Oscar, do you know what I mean by stars,
  suns, constellations, planets, nebulae, and atoms, protons, and
  electrons?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how? Have you ever seen the stars that are above these eternal
  clouds? Or the Sun there beyond the barrier?"</p>

  <p>"No. Reason is enough, because there is only one possible way in which the
  universe could exist. Only what is possible is real; what is not real is also
  not possible."</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;that seems to mean something," murmured Pat. "I don't see
  exactly what. But Oscar, why&mdash;why don't you use your knowledge to
  protect yourselves from your enemies?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need. There is no need to do anything. In a hundred years we
  shall be&mdash;" Silence.</p>

  <p>"Safe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"What?" A horrible thought struck her. "Do you mean&mdash;extinct?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;oh, Oscar! Don't you <i>want</i> to live? Don't your people
  want to survive?"</p>

  <p>"Want," shrilled Oscar. "Want&mdash;want&mdash;want. That word means
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"It means&mdash;it means desire, need."</p>

  <p>"Desire means nothing. Need&mdash;need. No. My people do not need to
  survive."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Pat faintly. "Then why do you reproduce?"</p>

  <p>As if in answer, a bursting pod sent its pungent dust over them. "Because
  we must," clicked Oscar. "When the spores strike us, we must."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;see," murmured Pat slowly. "Ham, I think I've got it. I think I
  understand. Let's get back to the ship."</p>

  <p>Without farewell she turned away and he followed her thoughtfully. A
  strange listlessness oppressed him.</p>

  <p>They had one slight mishap. A stone flung by some stray trioptes sheltered
  behind the ridge shattered the left lamp in Pat's helmet. It seemed hardly to
  disturb the girl; she glanced briefly aside and plodded on. But all the way
  back, in the gloom to their left now illumined only by his own lamp, hoots
  and shrieks and mocking laughter pursued them.</p>

  <p>Within the rocket Pat swung her specimen bag wearily to the table and sat
  down without removing her heavy outer garment. Nor did Ham; despite the
  oppressive warmth of it, he, too, dropped listlessly to a seat on the
  bunk.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired," said the girl, "but not too tired to realize what that
  mystery out there means."</p>

  <p>"Then let's hear it."</p>

  <p>"Ham," she said, "what's the big difference between plant and animal
  life?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;plants derive their sustenance directly from soil and air.
  Animals need plants or other animals as food."</p>

  <p>"That isn't entirely true, Ham. Some plants are parasitic, and prey on
  other life. Think of the Hotlands, or think, even, of some terrestrial plants
  &mdash;the fungi, the pitcher plant, the <i>Dionaea</i> that trap flies."</p>

  <p>"Well, animals move, then, and plants don't."</p>

  <p>"That's not true, either. Look at microbes; they're plants, but they swim
  about in search of food."</p>

  <p>"Then what <i>is</i> the difference?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes it's hard to say," she murmured, "but I think I see it now.
  It's this: Animals have desire and plants necessity. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Not a damn bit."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Then. A plant&mdash;even a moving one&mdash;acts the way it does
  because it <i>must</i>, because it's made so. An animal acts because it
  <i>wants</i> to, or because it's made so that it wants to."</p>

  <p>"What's the difference?"</p>

  <p>"There is a difference. An animal has will, a plant hasn't. Do you see
  now? Oscar has all the magnificent intelligence of a god, but he hasn't the
  will of a worm. He has reactions, but no desire. When the wind is warm he
  comes out and feeds; when it's cold he crawls back into the cave melted by
  his body heat, but that isn't will, it's just a reaction. He has no
  desires!"</p>

  <p>Ham stared, roused out of his lassitude. "I'll be damned if it isn't
  true!" he cried. "That's why he&mdash;or they&mdash;never ask questions. It
  takes desire or will to ask a question! And that's why they have no
  civilization and never will have!"</p>

  <p>"That and other reasons," said Pat. "Think of this: Oscar has no sex, and
  in spite of your Yankee pride, sex has been a big factor in building
  civilization. It's the basis of the family, and among Oscar's people there is
  no such thing as parent and child. He splits; each half of him is an adult,
  probably with all the knowledge and memory of the original.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for love, no place for it, in fact, and therefore no call
  to fight for mate and family, and no reason to make life easier than it
  already is, and no cause to apply his intelligence to develop art or science
  or&mdash;or anything!" She paused. "And did you ever hear of the Malthusian
  law, Ham?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I remember."</p>

  <p>"Well, the law of Malthus says that population presses on the food supply.
  Increase the food and the population increases in proportion. Man evolved
  under that law; for a century or so it's been suspended, but our race grew to
  be human under it."</p>

  <p>"Suspended! It sounds sort of like repealing the law of gravitation or
  amending the law of inverse squares."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she said. "It was suspended by the development of machinery in
  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which shot the food supply so far
  ahead, that population hasn't caught up. But it will and the Malthusian law
  will rule again."</p>

  <p>"And what's that got to do with Oscar?"</p>

  <p>"This, Ham: He never evolved under that law. Other factors kept his
  numbers below the limit of the food supply, and so his species developed free
  of the need to struggle for food. He's so perfectly adapted to his
  environment that he needs nothing more. To him a civilization would be
  superfluous!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;then what of the triops?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the triops. You see, Ham, just as I argued days ago, the triops is a
  newcomer, pushed over from the twilight zone. When those devils arrived,
  Oscar's people were already evolved, and they couldn't change to meet the new
  conditions, or couldn't change quickly enough. So&mdash;they're doomed.</p>

  <p>"As Oscar says, they'll be extinct soon&mdash;and&mdash;and they don't
  even care." She shuddered. "All they do, all they can do, is sit before their
  caves and think. Probably they think godlike thoughts, but they can't summon
  even a mouse-like will. That's what a vegetable intelligence is; that's what
  it has to be!"</p>

  <p>"I think&mdash;I think you're right," he muttered. "In a way it's
  horrible, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Despite her heavy garments she shivered. "Yes; it's horrible. Those
  vast, magnificent minds and no way for them to work. It's like a powerful
  gasoline motor with its drive shaft broken, and no matter how well it runs it
  can't turn the wheels. Ham, do you know what I'm going to name them? The
  <i>Lotophagi Veneris</i>&mdash;the Lotus Eaters! Content to sit and dream
  away existence while lesser minds&mdash;ours and the trioptes'&mdash;battle
  for their planet."</p>

  <p>"It's a good name, Pat." As she rose he asked in surprise: "Your
  specimens? Aren't you going to prepare them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, to-morrow." She flung herself, parka and all, on her bunk.</p>

  <p>"But they'll spoil! And your helmet light&mdash;I ought to fix it."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," she repeated wearily, and his own languor kept him from
  further argument.</p>

  <p>When the nauseous odor of decay awakened him some hours later Pat was
  asleep, still garbed in the heavy suit. He flung bag and specimens from the
  door, and then slipped the parka from her body. She hardly stirred as he
  tucked her gently into her bunk.</p>

  <p>Pat never missed the specimen bag at all, and, somehow, the next day, if
  one could call that endless night a day, found them trudging over the bleak
  plateau with the girl's helmet lamp still unrepaired. Again at their left,
  the wildly mocking laughter of the night dwellers followed them, drifting
  eerily down on the Underwind, and twice far-flung stones chipped glittering
  ice from neighboring spires. They plodded listlessly and silently, as if in a
  sort of fascination, but their minds seemed strangely clear.</p>

  <p>Pat addressed the first Lotus Eater they saw. "We're back, Oscar," she
  said with a faint rebirth of her usual flippancy. "How'd you spend the
  night?"</p>

  <p>"I thought," clicked the thing.</p>

  <p>"What'd you think about?"</p>

  <p>"I thought about&mdash;" The voice ceased.</p>

  <p>A pod popped, and the curiously pleasant pungent odor was in their
  nostrils.</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;us?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;the world?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"About&mdash;What's the use?" she ended wearily. "We could keep that up
  forever, and perhaps never hit on the right question."</p>

  <p>"If there is a right question," added Ham. "How do you know there are
  words to fit it? How do you even know that it's the kind of thought our minds
  are capable of conceiving? There must be thoughts that are beyond our
  grasp."</p>

  <p>Off to their left a pod burst with a dull <i>pop</i>. Ham saw the dust
  move like a shadow across their beams as the Underwind caught it, and he saw
  Pat draw a deep draft of the pungent air as it whirled around her. Queer how
  pleasant the smell was, especially since it was the same stuff which in
  higher concentration had nearly cost their lives. He felt vaguely worried as
  that thought struck him, but could assign no reason for worry.</p>

  <p>He realized suddenly that both of them were standing in complete silence
  before the Lotus Eater. They had come to ask questions, hadn't they?</p>

  <p>"Oscar," he said, "what's the meaning of life?"</p>

  <p>"No meaning. There is no meaning."</p>

  <p>"Then why fight for it so?"</p>

  <p>"We do not fight for it. Life is unimportant."</p>

  <p>"And when you're gone, the world goes on just the same? Is that it?" "When
  we are gone it will make no difference to any except the trioptes who eat
  us."</p>

  <p>"Who eat you," echoed Ham.</p>

  <p>There was something about that thought that did penetrate the fog of
  indifference that blanketed his mind. He peered at Pat, who stood passively
  and silently beside him, and in the glow of her helmet lamp he could see her
  clear gray eyes behind her goggles, staring straight ahead in what was
  apparently abstraction or deep thought. And beyond the ridge sounded suddenly
  the yells and wild laughter of the dwellers in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Pat," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Pat!" he repeated, raising a listless hand to her arm. "We have to go
  back." To his right a pod popped. "We have to go back," he repeated.</p>

  <p>A sudden shower of stones came glancing over the ridge. One struck his
  helmet, and his forward lamp burst with a dull explosion. Another struck his
  arm with a stinging pain, though it seemed surprisingly unimportant.</p>

  <p>"We have to go back," he reiterated doggedly.</p>

  <p>Pat spoke at last without moving. "What's the use?" she asked dully.</p>

  <p>He frowned over that. What <i>was</i> the use? To go back to the twilight
  zone? A picture of Erotia rose in his mind, and then a vision of that
  honeymoon they had planned on the Earth, and then a whole series of
  terrestrial scenes&mdash;New York, a tree-girt campus, the sunny farm of his
  boyhood. But they all seemed very far away and unreal.</p>

  <p>A violent blow that stung his shoulder recalled him, and he saw a stone
  bound from Pat's helmet. Only two of her lamps glowed now, the rear and the
  right, and he realized vaguely that on his own helmet shone only the rear and
  the left. Shadowy figures were skittering and gibbering along the crest of
  the ridge now left dark by the breaking of their lights, and stones were
  whizzing and spattering around them.</p>

  <p>He made a supreme effort and seized her arm. "We've got to go back!" he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"Why? Why should we?"</p>

  <p>"Because we'll be killed if we stay."</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know that, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He ceased to listen and jerked savagely at Pat's arm. She spun around and
  staggered after him as he turned doggedly toward the rocket.</p>

  <p>Shrill hoots sounded as their rear lamps swept the ridge, and as he
  dragged the girl with infinite slowness, the shrieks spread out to the right
  and left. He knew what that meant; the demons were circling them to get in
  front of them where their shattered forward lamps cast no protecting
  light.</p>

  <p>Pat followed listlessly, making no effort of her own. It was simply the
  drag of his arm that impelled her, and it was becoming an intolerable effort
  to move even himself. And there directly before him, flitting shadows that
  howled and hooted, were the devils that sought their lives.</p>

  <p>Ham twisted his head so that his right lamp swept the area. Shrieks
  sounded as they found shelter in the shadows of peaks and ridges, but Ham,
  walking with his head sidewise, tripped and tumbled.</p>

  <p>Pat wouldn't rise when he tugged at her. "There's no need of it," she
  murmured, but made no resistance when he lifted her.</p>

  <p>An idea stirred vaguely; he bundled her into his arms so that her right
  lamp shot its beam forward, and so he staggered at last to the circle of
  light about the rocket, opened the door, and dumped her on the floor
  within.</p>

  <p>He had one final impression. He saw the laughing shadows that were the
  trioptes skipping and skittering across the darkness toward the ridge where
  Oscar and his people waited in placid acceptance of their destiny.</p>

  <p>The rocket was roaring along at two hundred thousand feet, because
  numberless observations and photographs from space had shown that not even
  the vast peaks of the Mountains of Eternity project forty miles above the
  planet's surface. Below them the clouds glistened white before and black
  behind, for they were just entering the twilight zone. At that height one
  could even see the mighty curvature of the planet.</p>

  <p>"Half cue ball, half eight ball," said Ham, staring down. "Hereafter we
  stick to the cue-ball half."</p>

  <p>"It was the spores," proceeded Pat, ignoring him. "We <i>knew</i> they
  were narcotic before, but we couldn't be expected to guess that they'd carry
  a drug as subtle as that&mdash;to steal away your will and undermine your
  strength. Oscar's people are the Lotus Eaters and the Lotus, all in one. But
  I'm&mdash;somehow&mdash;I'm sorry for them. Those colossal, magnificent,
  useless minds of theirs!" What snapped you out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was a remark of Oscar's, something about his being only a square
  meal for a triops."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well, did you know we've used up all our food? That remark reminded me
  that I hadn't eaten for two days!"</p>
