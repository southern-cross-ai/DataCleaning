<h2><a id="zero1"></a>CHAPTER 1. &mdash; TRY FOR ETERNITY</h2>

<p class="first"><i>If there were a mountain a thousand miles
high and every thousand years a bird flew over it, just brushing
the peak with the tip of its wing, in the course of inconceivable
eons the mountain would be worn away. Yet all those ages would
not be one second to the length of eternity</i>.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">I DON'T know what philosophical mind penned the
foregoing, but the words keep recurring to me since last I saw
old Aurore de N&eacute;ant, erstwhile professor of psychology at
Tulane. When, back in '24, I took that course in Morbid
Psychology from him, I think the only reason for taking it at all
was that I needed an eleven o'clock on Tuesdays and Thursdays to
round out a lazy program.</p>

<p>I was gay Jack Anders, twenty-two years old, and the reason
seemed sufficient. At least, I'm sure that dark and lovely Yvonne
de N&eacute;ant had nothing to do with it. She was but a slim
child of sixteen.</p>

<p>Old de N&eacute;ant liked me, Lord knows why, for I was a poor
enough student. Perhaps it was because I never, to his knowledge,
punned on his name. Aurore de N&eacute;ant translates to Dawn of
Nothingness, you see; you can imagine what students did to such a
name. 'Rising Zero'&mdash;'Empty Morning'&mdash;those were two of
the milder soubriquets.</p>

<p>That was in '24. Five years later I was a bond salesman in New
York and Professor Aurore de N&eacute;ant was fired. I learned
about it when he called me up. I had drifted quite out of touch
with University days.</p>

<p>He was a thrifty sort. He had saved a comfortable sum, and had
moved to New York and that's when I started seeing Yvonne again,
now darkly beautiful as a Tanagra figurine. I was doing pretty
well and was piling up a surplus against the day when Yvonne and
I...</p>

<p>At least that was the situation in August, 1929. In October of
the same year I was as clean as a gnawed bone and old de
N&eacute;ant had but little more meat. I was young and could
afford to laugh&mdash;he was old and he turned bitter. Indeed,
Yvonne and I did little enough laughing when we thought of our
own future&mdash;but we didn't brood like the professor.</p>

<p>I remember the evening he broached the subject of the Circle
of Zero. It was a rainy, blustering fall night and his beard
waggled in the dim lamplight like a wisp of grey mist. Yvonne and
I had been staying in evenings of late. Shows cost money and I
felt that she appreciated my talking to her father,
and&mdash;after all&mdash;he retired early.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the davenport at his side when he suddenly
stabbed a gnarled finger at me and snapped, 'Happiness depends on
money!'</p>

<p>I was startled. 'Well, it helps,' I agreed.</p>

<p>His pale blue eyes glittered. 'We must recover ours!' he
rasped.</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'I know how. Yes, I know how,' he grinned thinly. 'They think
I'm mad. <i>You</i> think I'm mad. Even Yvonne thinks so.'</p>

<p>The girl said softly, reproachfully, 'Father!'</p>

<p>'But I'm not,' he continued. 'You and Yvonne and all the fools
holding chairs at universities&mdash;yes! But not I.'</p>

<p>'I will be all right, if conditions don't get better soon,' I
murmured. I was used to the old man's outbursts.</p>

<p>'They will be better for us,' he said, calming. 'Money! We
will do anything for money, won't we, Anders?'</p>

<p>'Anything honest.'</p>

<p>'Yes, anything honest. Time is honest, isn't it? An honest
cheat, because it takes everything human and turns it into dust.'
He peered at my puzzled face. I will explain,' he said, 'how we
can cheat time.'</p>

<p>'Cheat&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes. Listen, Jack. Have you ever stood in a strange place and
felt a sense of having been there before? Have you ever taken a
trip and sensed that sometime, somehow, you had done exactly the
same thing&mdash;when you know you hadn't?'</p>

<p>'Of course. Everyone has. A memory of the present, Bergson
calls it.'</p>

<p>Bergson is a fool! Philosophy without science. Listen to me.'
He leaned forward. 'Did you ever hear of the Law of Chance?'</p>

<p>I laughed. 'My business is stocks and bonds. I <i>ought</i> to
know of it.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' he said, 'but not enough of it. Suppose I have a barrel
with a million trillion white grains of sand in it and one black
grain. You stand and draw single grains, one after the other,
look at each one and throw it back into the barrel. What are the
odds against drawing the black grain?'</p>

<p>'A million trillion to one, on each draw.'</p>

<p>'And if you draw half of the million trillion grains?'</p>

<p>'Then the odds are even.'</p>

<p>'So!' he said. 'In other words, if you draw long enough, even
though you return each grain to the barrel and draw again, some
day you will draw the black one&mdash;<i>if you try long
enough!</i>'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said.</p>

<p>He half smiled.</p>

<p>'Suppose now you tried for eternity?'</p>

<p>'Eh?</p>

<p>'Don't you see, Jack? In eternity the Law of Chance functions
perfectly. In eternity, sooner or later, every possible
combination of things and events must happen. <i>Must</i> happen,
if it's a possible combination. I say, therefore, that in
eternity, <i>whatever can happen, will happen</i>!' His blue eyes
blazed in pale fire.</p>

<p>I was a trifle dazed. 'I guess you're right,' I muttered.</p>

<p>'Right! Of course I'm right. Mathematics is infallible. Now do
you see the conclusion?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;that sooner or later everything will happen.'</p>

<p>'Bah! It is true that there is eternity in the future; we
cannot imagine time ending. But Flammarion, before he died,
pointed out that there is also an eternity in the past. Since in
eternity everything possible must happen, it follows that
everything <i>must already have happened</i>!'</p>

<p>I gasped. 'Wait a minute! I don't see&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stupidity!' he hissed. 'It is but to say with Einstein that
not only space is curved, but time. To say that, after untold
eons of millennia, the same things repeat themselves because they
must! The Law of Chance says they must, given time enough. The
past and the future are the same thing, because everything that
will happen must already have happened. Can't you follow so
simple a chain of logic?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;yes. But where does it lead?'</p>

<p>To our money! To our money!'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Listen. Do not interrupt. In the past all possible
combinations of atoms and circumstances must have occurred.' He
paused then stabbed that bony finger of his at me. 'Jack Anders,
<i>you</i> are a possible combination of atoms and circumstances!
Possible because you exist at this moment!'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;that <i>I</i> have happened before?'</p>

<p>'How apt you are! Yes, you have happened before and will
again.'</p>

<p>'Transmigration!' I gulped. 'That's unscientific.'</p>

<p>'Indeed?' He frowned as if in effort to gather his thoughts.
'The poet Robert Burns was buried under an apple tree. When,
years after his death, he was to be removed to rest among the
great men of Westminster Abbey, do you know what they found? Do
you know?'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, but I don't.'</p>

<p>'They found a root! A root with a bulge for a head, branch
roots for arms and legs and little rootlets for fingers and toes.
The apple tree had eaten Bobby Burns&mdash;but who had eaten the
apples?'</p>

<p>'Who&mdash;what?'</p>

<p>'Exactly. Who and what? The substance that had been Burns was
in the bodies of Scotch countrymen and children, in the bodies of
caterpillars who had eaten the leaves and become butterflies and
been eaten by birds, in the wood of the tree. Where is Bobby
Burns? Transmigration, I tell you! Isn't that
transmigration?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;but not what you meant about me. His body may be
living, but in a thousand different forms.'</p>

<p>'Ah! And when some day, eons and eternities in the future, the
Laws of Chance form another nebula that will cool to another sun
and another earth, is there not the same chance that those
scattered atoms may reassemble another Bobby Burns?'</p>

<p>'But what a chance! Trillions and trillions to one!'</p>

<p>'But eternity, Jack! In eternity that one chance out of all
those trillions must happen&mdash;<i>must</i> happen!'</p>

<p>I was floored. I stared at Yvonne's pale and lovely features,
then at the glistening old eyes of Aurore de N&eacute;ant.</p>

<p>'You win,' I said with a long sigh. 'But what of it? This is
still nineteen twenty-nine, and our money's still sunk in a very
sick securities market.'</p>

<p>'<i>Money</i>!' he groaned. 'Don't you see? That memory we
started from &mdash;that sense of having done a thing
before&mdash;that's a memory out of the infinitely remote future.
If only&mdash;if only one could remember clearly! But I have a
way.' His voice rose suddenly to a shrill scream. 'Yes, I have a
way!'</p>

<p>Wild eyes glared at me. I said, 'A way to remember our former
incarnations?' One had to humor the old professor. 'To
remember&mdash;the future?'</p>

<p>'Yes! Reincarnation!' His voice crackled wildly.
<i>Re-in-carnatione</i>, which is Latin for "by the thing in
the carnation", but it wasn't a carnation &mdash;it was an apple
tree. The carnation is <i>dianthus carophyllus</i>, which proved
that the Hottentots plant carnations on the graves of their
ancestors, whence the expression "nipped in the bud". If
carnations grow on apple trees&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Father!' cut in Yvonne sharply. 'You're tired!' Her voice
softened. 'Come. You're going to bed.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he cackled. To a bed of carnations.'</p>

<h2><a id="zero2"></a>CHAPTER 2. &mdash; MEMORY OF THINGS PAST</h2>

<p class="first">SOME evenings later Aurore de N&eacute;ant
reverted to the same topic. He was clear enough as to where he
had left off.</p>

<p>'So in this millennially dead past,' he began suddenly, 'there
was a year nineteen twenty-nine and two fools named Anders and de
N&eacute;ant, who invested their money in what are sarcastically
called securities. There was a clown's panic, and their money
vanished.' He leered fantastically at me.</p>

<p>'Wouldn't it be nice if they could remember what happened in,
say, the months from December, nineteen twenty-nine, to June,
nineteen thirty&mdash; next year?' His voice was suddenly
whining. 'They could get their money back then!'</p>

<p>I humored him. 'If they could remember.'</p>

<p>They can!' he blazed. 'They can!'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>His voice dropped to a confidential softness. 'Hypnotism! You
studied Morbid Psychology under me, didn't you, Jack? Yes&mdash;I
remember.'</p>

<p>'But, hypnotism!' I objected. 'Every psychiatrist uses that in
his treatments and no one has remembered a previous incarnation
or anything like it.'</p>

<p>'No. They're fools, these doctors and psychiatrists.
Listen&mdash;do you remember the three stages of the hypnotic
state as you learned them?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Somnambulism, lethargy, catalepsy.'</p>

<p>'Right. In the first the subject speaks, answers questions. In
the second he sleeps deeply. In the third, catalepsy, he is
rigid, stiff, so that he can be laid across two chairs, sat
on&mdash;all that nonsense.'</p>

<p>'I remember. What of it?'</p>

<p>He grinned bleakly. 'In the first stage the subject remembers
everything that ever happened during his life. His subconscious
mind is dominant and that never forgets. Correct?'</p>

<p>'So we were taught.'</p>

<p>He leaned tensely forward. 'In the second stage, lethargy, my
theory is that he remembers everything that happened in his other
lives! He remembers the future!'</p>

<p>'Huh? Why doesn't someone do it, then?'</p>

<p>'He remembers while he sleeps. He forgets when he wakes.
That's why. But I believe that with proper training he can learn
to remember.'</p>

<p>'And you're going to try?'</p>

<p>'Not I. I know too little of finance. I wouldn't know how to
interpret my memories.'</p>

<p>'Who, then?'</p>

<p>'You!' He jabbed that long finger against me.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly startled. 'Me? Oh, no! Not a chance of
it!'</p>

<p>'Jack,' he said querulously, 'didn't you study hypnotism in my
course? Didn't you learn how harmless it is? You know what
tommy-rot the idea is of one mind dominating another. You know the subject really hypnotizes himself, that no one can hypnotize an unwilling person. Then what are you afraid of?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;well,' I didn't know what to answer.</p>

<p>I'm not afraid,' I said grimly. 'I just don't like it.'</p>

<p>'You're afraid!'</p>

<p>'I'm not!'</p>

<p>'You are!' He was growing excited.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that Yvonne's footsteps sounded in the
hall. His eyes glittered. He looked at me with a sinister hint of
cunning.</p>

<p>'I dislike cowards,' he whispered. His voice rose. 'So does
Yvonne!'</p>

<p>The girl entered, perceiving his excitement. 'Oh!' she
frowned. 'Why do you have to take these theories so to heart,
father?'</p>

<p>'Theories?' he screeched. 'Yes! I have a theory that when you
walk you stand still and the sidewalk moves back. No&mdash;then
the sidewalk moves back. No&mdash;then the sidewalk would split
if two people walked towards each other&mdash;or maybe it's
elastic. Of course it's elastic! That's why the last mile is the
longest. It's been stretched!'</p>

<p>Yvonne got him to bed.</p>

<p>Well, he talked me into it. I don't know how much was due to
my own credulity and how much to Yvonne's solemn dark eyes. I
half-believed the professor by the time he'd spent another
evening in argument but I think the clincher was his veiled
threat to forbid Yvonne my company. She'd have obeyed him if it
killed her. She was from New Orleans too, you see, and of Creole
blood.</p>

<p>I won't describe that troublesome course of training. One has
to develop the hypnotic habit. It's like any other habit, and
must be formed slowly. Contrary to the popular opinion morons and
people of low intelligence can't ever do it. It takes real
concentration&mdash;the whole knack of it is the ability to
concentrate one's attention&mdash;and I don't mean the hypnotist,
either.</p>

<p>I mean the subject. The hypnotist hasn't a thing to do with it
except to furnish the necessary suggestion by murmuring,
'Sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash; sleep&mdash;sleep ...' And even that
isn't necessary once you learn the trick of it.</p>

<p>I spent half-an-hour or more nearly every evening, learning
that trick. It was tedious and a dozen times I became thoroughly
disgusted and swore to have no more to do with the farce. But
always, after the half-hour's humoring of de N&eacute;ant, there
was Yvonne, and boredom vanished. As a sort of reward, I suppose,
the old man took to leaving us alone. And we used our time, I'll
wager, to better purpose than he used his.</p>

<p>But I began to learn, little by little. Came a time, after
three weeks of tedium, when I was able to cast myself into a
light somnambulistic state. I remember how the glitter of the
cheap stone in Professor de N&eacute;ant's ring grew until it
filled the world and how his voice, mechanically dull, murmured
like the waves in my ears. I remember everything that transpired
during those minutes, even his query, 'Are you sleeping?' and my
automatic reply, 'Yes.'</p>

<p>By the end of November we had mastered the second state of
lethargy and then&mdash;I don't know why, but a sort of
enthusiasm for the madness took hold of me. Business was at a
standstill. I grew tired of facing customers to whom I had sold
bonds at a par that were now worth fifty or less and trying to
explain why. After a while I began to drop in on the professor
during the afternoon and we went through the insane routine again
and again.</p>

<p>Yvonne comprehended only a part of the bizarre scheme. She was
never in the room during our half-hour trials and knew only
vaguely that we were involved in some sort of experiment which
was to restore our lost money. I don't suppose she had much faith
in it but she always indulged her father.</p>

<p>It was early in December that I began to remember things. Dim
and formless things at first&mdash;sensations that utterly eluded
the rigidities of words. I tried to express them to de
N&eacute;ant but it was hopeless.</p>

<p>'A circular feeling,' I'd say. 'No&mdash;not exactly&mdash;a
sense of spiral&mdash;not that, either. Roundness&mdash;I can't
recall it now. It slips away.'</p>

<p>He was jubilant. 'It comes!' he whispered, grey beard a-waggle
and pale eyes glittering. 'You begin to remember!'</p>

<p>'But what good is a memory like that?'</p>

<p>'Wait! It will come clearer. Of course not all your memories
will be of the sort we can use. They will be scattered. Through
all the multifold eternities of the past-future circle you can't
have been always Jack Anders, securities salesman.</p>

<p>'There will be fragmentary memories, recollections of times
when your personality was partially existent, when the Laws of
Chance had assembled a being who was not quite Jack Anders, in
some period of the infinite worlds that must have risen and died
in the span of eternities.</p>

<p>'But somewhere, too, the same atoms, the same conditions, must
have made <i>you</i>. You're the black grain among the trillions
of white grains and, with all eternity to draw in from, you must
have been drawn before&mdash; many, many times.'</p>

<p>'Do you suppose,' I asked suddenly, 'that anyone exists twice
on the same earth? Reincarnation in the sense of the Hindus?'</p>

<p>He laughed scornfully. 'The age of the earth is somewhere
between a thousand million and three thousand million years. What
proportion of eternity is that?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;no proportion at all. Zero.'</p>

<p>'Exactly. And zero represents the chance of the same atoms
combining to form the same person twice in one cycle of a planet.
But I have shown that trillions, or trillions of trillions of
years ago, there <i>must</i>have been another earth, another Jack
Anders, and'&mdash;his voice took on that whining
note&mdash;'another crash that ruined Jack Anders and old de
N&eacute;ant. That is the time you must remember out of
lethargy.'</p>

<p>'Catalepsy!' I said. 'What would one remember in that?'</p>

<p>'God knows.'</p>

<p>'What a mad scheme!' I said suddenly. 'What a crazy pair of
fools we are!' The adjectives were a mistake.</p>

<p>'Mad? Crazy?' His voice became a screech. 'Old de N&eacute;ant
is mad, eh? Old Dawn of Nothingness is crazy! You think time
doesn't go in a circle, don't you? Do you know what a circle
represents? I'll tell you!</p>

<p>'A circle is the mathematical symbol for zero! Time is
zero&mdash;time is a circle. I have a theory that the hands of a
clock are really the noses, because they're on the clock's face,
and since time is a circle they go round and round and round
...'</p>

<p>Yvonne slipped quietly into the room and patted her father's
furrowed forehead. She must have been listening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="zero3">CHAPTER 3. &mdash; NIGHTMARE OR TRUTH?</a></h2>

<p class="first">'LOOK here,' I said at a later time to de
N&eacute;ant. 'If the past and future are the same thing, then
the future's as unchangeable as the past. How, then, can we
expect to change it by recovering our money?'</p>

<p>'Change it?' he snorted. 'How do you know we're changing it?
How do you know that this same thing wasn't done by that Jack
Anders and de N&eacute;ant back on the other side of eternity? I
say it was!'</p>

<p>I subsided, and the weird business went on. My
memories&mdash;if they were memories&mdash;were becoming clearer
now. Often and often I saw things out of my own immediate past of
twenty-seven years, though of course de N&eacute;ant assured me
that these were visions from the past of that other self on the
far side of time.</p>

<p>I saw other things too, incidents that I couldn't place in my
experience, though I couldn't be quite sure they didn't belong
there. I might have forgotten, you see, since they were of no
particular importance. I recounted everything dutifully to the
old man immediately upon awakening and sometimes that was
difficult&mdash;like trying to find words for a half-remembered
dream.</p>

<p>There were other memories as well&mdash;bizarre, outlandish
dreams that had little parallel in human history. These were
always vague and sometimes very horrible and only their inchoate
and formless character kept them from being utterly nerve-racking
and terrifying.</p>

<p>At one time, I recall, I was gazing through a little
crystalline window into a red fog through which moved
indescribable faces&mdash;not human, not even associable with
anything I had ever seen. On another occasion I was wandering,
clad in furs, across a cold grey desert and at my side was a
woman who was not quite Yvonne.</p>

<p>I remember calling her Pyroniva, and knowing that the name
meant 'Snowy-fire'. And here and there in the air about us
floated fungoid things, bobbing around like potatoes in a
water-bucket. And once we stood very quiet while a menacing form
that was only remotely like the small fungi droned purposefully
far overhead, toward some unknown objective.</p>

<p>At still another time I was peering, fascinated, into a
spinning pool of mercury, watching an image therein of two wild
winged figures playing in a roseate glade&mdash;not at all human
in form but transcendently beautiful, bright and iridescent.</p>

<p>I felt a strange kinship between these two creatures and
myself and Yvonne but I had no inkling of what they were, nor
upon what world, nor at what time in eternity, nor even of what
nature was the room that held the spinning pool that pictured
them.</p>

<p>Old Aurore de N&eacute;ant listened carefully to the wild
word-pictures I drew.</p>

<p>'Fascinating!' he muttered. 'Glimpses of an infinitely distant
future caught from a ten-fold infinitely remote past. These
things you describe are not earthly; it means that somewhere,
sometime, men are actually to burst the prison of space and visit
other worlds. Some day ...'</p>

<p>'If these glimpses aren't simply nightmares,' I said.</p>

<p>They're not nightmares,' he snapped, 'but they might as well
be for all the value they are to us.' I could see him struggle to
calm himself. 'Our money is still gone. We must try, keep trying
for years, for centuries, until we get the black grain of sand,
because black sand is a sign of gold-bearing ore ...' He paused.
'What am I talking about?' he said querulously.</p>

<p>Well, we kept trying. Interspersed with the wild, all but
indescribable visions came others almost rational. The thing
became a fascinating game. I was neglecting my
business&mdash;though that was small loss&mdash;to chase dreams
with old Professor Aurore de N&eacute;ant.</p>

<p>I spent evenings, afternoons and finally mornings, too, living
in the slumber of the lethargic state or telling the old man what
fantastic things I had dreamed&mdash;or, as he said, remembered.
Reality became dim to me. I was living in an outlandish world of
fancy and only the dark, tragic eyes of Yvonne tugged at me,
pulled me back into the daylight world of sanity.</p>

<p>I have mentioned more nearly rational visions. I recall one a
city&mdash; but what a city! Sky-piercing, white and beautiful
and the people of it were grave with the wisdom of gods, pale and
lovely people, but solemn, wistful, sad. There was the aura of
brilliance and wickedness that hovers about all great cities,
that was born, I suppose, in Babylon and will remain until great
cities are no more.</p>

<p>But that was something else, something intangible. I don't
know exactly what to call it but perhaps the word decadence is as
close as any word we have. As I stood at the base of a colossal
structure there was the whir of quiet machinery but it seemed to
me, nevertheless, that the city was dying.</p>

<p>It might have been the moss that grew green on the north walls
of the buildings. It might have been the grass that pierced here
and there through the cracks of the marble pavements. Or it might
have been only the grave and sad demeanor of the pale
inhabitants. There was something that hinted of a doomed city and
a dying race.</p>

<p>A strange thing happened when I tried to describe this
particular memory to old de N&eacute;ant. I stumbled over the
details, of course&mdash;these visions from the unplumbed depths
of eternity were curiously hard to fix between the rigid walls of
words. They tended to grow vague, to elude the waking memory.
Thus, in this description I had forgotten the name of the
city.</p>

<p>'It was called,' I said hesitatingly, Termis or Termoplia, or
...'</p>

<p>'Termopolis!' cried de N&eacute;ant impatiently. 'City of the
End!'</p>

<p>I stared amazed. That's it! But how did you know?' In the
sleep of lethargy, I was sure, one never speaks.</p>

<p>A queer, cunning look flashed in his pale eyes. 'I knew,' he
muttered. 'I knew.' He would say no more.</p>

<p>But I think I saw that city once again. It was when I wandered
over a brown and treeless plain, not like that cold grey desert
but apparently an arid and barren region of the earth. Dim on the
western horizon was the circle of a great cool reddish sun. It
had always been there, I remembered, and knew with some other
part of my mind that the vast brake of the tides had at last
slowed the earth's rotation to a stop, that day and night no
longer chased each other around the planet.</p>

<p>The air was biting cold and my companions and I&mdash;there
were half a dozen of us&mdash;moved in a huddled group as if to
lend each other warmth from our half-naked bodies. We were all of
us thin-legged, skinny creatures with oddly deep chests and
enormous, luminous eyes, and the one nearest me was again a woman
who had something of Yvonne in her but very little. And I was not
quite Jack Anders, either. But some remote fragment of me
survived in that barbaric brain.</p>

<p>Beyond a hill was the surge of an oily sea. We crept circling
about the mound and suddenly I perceived that sometime in the
infinite past that hill had been a city. A few Gargantuan blocks
of stone lay crumbling on it and one lonely fragment of a ruined
wall rose gauntly to four or five times a man's height. It was at
this spectral remnant that the leader of our miserable crew
gestured then spoke in sombre tones&mdash;not English words but I
understood.</p>

<p>'The Gods,' he said&mdash;'the Gods who piled stones upon
stones are dead and harm us not who pass the place of their
dwelling.'</p>

<p>I knew what that was meant to be. It was an incantation, a
ritual&mdash; to protect us from the spirits that lurked among
the ruins&mdash;the ruins, I believe, of a city built by our own
ancestors thousands of generations before.</p>

<p>As we passed the wall I looked back at a flicker of movement
and saw something hideously like a black rubber doormat flop
itself around the angle of the wall. I drew closer to the woman
beside me and we crept on down to the sea for water&mdash;yes,
water, for with the cessation of the planet's rotation rainfall
had vanished also, and all life huddled near the edge of the
undying sea and learned to drink its bitter brine.</p>

<p>I didn't glance again at the hill which had been Termopolis,
the City of the End. But I knew that some chance-born fragment of
Jack Anders had been &mdash;or will be (what difference, if time
is a circle?)&mdash;witness of an age close to the day of
humanity's doom.</p>

<p>It was early in December that I had the first memory of
something that might have been suggestive of success. It was a
simple and very sweet memory, just Yvonne and I in a garden that
I knew was the inner grounds on one of the New Orleans' old
homes&mdash;one of those built in the Continental fashion about a
court.</p>

<p>We sat on a stone bench beneath the oleanders and I slipped my
arm very tenderly about her and murmured, 'Are you happy,
Yvonne?'</p>

<p>She looked at me with those tragic eyes of hers and smiled,
and then answered, 'As happy as I have ever been.'</p>

<p>And I kissed her.</p>

<p>That was all, but it was important. It was vastly important
because it was definitely not a memory out of my own personal
past. You see, I had never sat beside Yvonne in a garden sweet
with oleanders in the Old Town of New Orleans and I had never
kissed her until we met in New York.</p>

<p>Aurore de N&eacute;ant was elated when I described this
vision.</p>

<p>'You see!' he gloated. There is evidence. You have remembered
the future! Not your own future, of course, but that of another
ghostly Jack Anders, who died trillions and quadrillions of years
ago.'</p>

<p>'But it doesn't help us, does it?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, it will come now! You wait. The thing we want will
come.'</p>

<p>And it did, within a week. This memory was curiously bright
and clear, and familiar in every detail. I remember the day. It
was the eighth of December, 1929, and I had wandered aimlessly
about in search of business during the morning. In the grip of
that fascination I mentioned I drifted to de N&eacute;ant's
apartment after lunch. Yvonne left us to ourselves, as was her
custom, and we began.</p>

<p>This was, as I said, a sharply outlined memory&mdash;or dream.
I was leaning over my desk in the company's office, that
too-seldom visited office. One of the other
salesmen&mdash;Summers was his name&mdash;was leaning over my
shoulder.</p>

<p>We were engaged in the quite customary pastime of scanning the
final market reports in the evening paper. The print stood out,
clear as reality itself. I glanced without surprise at the
dateline. It was Thursday, April 27th, 1930&mdash;almost five
months in the future!</p>

<p>Not that I realized that during the vision, of course. The day
was merely the present to me. I was simply looking over the list
of the day's trading. Figures&mdash;familiar names. Telephone
210&frac34;&mdash;US Steel &mdash;161; Paramount, 68&frac12;.</p>

<p>I jabbed a finger at Steel. 'I bought that at 72,' I said over
my shoulder to Summers. 'I sold out everything today. Every stock
I own. I'm getting out before there's a secondary crash.'</p>

<p>'Lucky stiff!' he murmured. 'Buy at the December lows and sell
out now! Wish I'd had money to do it.' He paused, 'What you gonna
do? Stay with the company?'</p>

<p>'No, I've enough to live on. I'm going to stick it in
Governments and paid-up insurance and live on the income. I've
had enough of gambling.'</p>

<p>'You lucky stiff!' he said again. 'I'm sick of the Street too.
Staying in New York?'</p>

<p>'For a while. Just till I get my stuff invested properly;
Yvonne and I are going to New Orleans for the winter.' I paused.
'She's had a tough time of it. I'm glad we're where we are.'</p>

<p>'Who wouldn't be?' asked Summers, and then again, 'You lucky
stiff!'</p>

<p>De N&eacute;ant was frantically excited when I described this
to him.</p>

<p>That's it!' he screamed. 'We buy! We buy tomorrow! We sell on
the twenty-seventh of May and then&mdash;New Orleans!'</p>

<p>Of course I was nearly equally enthusiastic. 'By heaven!' I
said. 'It's worth the risk! We'll do it!' And then a sudden
hopeless thought. 'Do it? Do it with what? I have less than a
hundred dollars to my name. And you ...'</p>

<p>The old man groaned. 'I have nothing,' he said in abrupt
gloom. 'Only the annuity we live on. One can't borrow on that.'
Again a gleam of hope. The banks. We'll borrow from them!'</p>

<p>I had to laugh, although it was a bitter laugh. 'What bank
would lend us money on a story like this? They wouldn't lend
Rockefeller himself money to play this sick market, not without
security. We're sunk, that's all.'</p>

<p>I looked at his pale, worried eyes. 'Sunk,' he echoed dully.
Then again that wild gleam. '<i>Not</i> sunk!' he yelled. 'How
can we be? We <i>did</i> do it! You remembered our doing it! We
must have found the way!'</p>

<p>I gazed speechless. Suddenly a queer, mad thought flashed over
me. This other Jack Anders, this ghost of quadrillions of
centuries past&mdash;or future&mdash;he too must be watching, or
had watched, or yet would watch, me&mdash;the Jack Anders of this
cycle of eternity.</p>

<p>He must be watching as anxiously as I to discover the means.
Each of us watching the other&mdash;neither of us knowing the
answer. The blind leading the blind! I laughed at the irony.</p>

<p>But old de N&eacute;ant was not laughing. The strangest
expression I have ever seen in a man's eyes was in his as he
repeated very softly, 'We must have found the way because it was
done. At least you and Yvonne found the way.'</p>

<p>'Then all of us must,' I answered sourly.</p>

<p>'Yes. Oh, yes. Listen to me, Jack. I am an old man, old Aurore
de N&eacute;ant. I am old Dawn of Nothingness and my mind is
cracking. Don't shake your head!' he snapped. 'I am not mad. I am
simply misunderstood. None of you understand.</p>

<p>'Why, I have a theory that trees, grass and people do not grow
taller at all. They grow by pushing the earth away from them,
which is why you keep hearing that the earth is getting smaller
every day. But you don't understand &mdash;Yvonne doesn't
understand.'</p>

<p>The girl must have been listening. Without my seeing her, she
had slipped into the room and put her arms gently about her
father's shoulders, while she gazed across at me with anxious
eyes.</p><hr>

<h2><a id="zero4"></a>CHAPTER 4. &mdash; THE BITTER FRUIT</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was one more vision, irrelevant in a way,
yet vitally important in another way. It was the next evening. An
early December snowfall was dropping its silent white beyond the
windows and the ill-heated apartment of the de N&eacute;ants was
draughty and chill.</p>

<p>I saw Yvonne shiver as she greeted me and again as she left
the room. I noticed that old de N&eacute;ant followed her to the
door with his thin arms about her and that he returned with very
worried eyes.</p>

<p>'She is New Orleans born,' he murmured. This dreadful Arctic
climate will destroy her. We must find a way at once.'</p>

<p>That vision was a sombre one. I stood on a cold, wet, snowy
ground&mdash; just myself and Yvonne and one who stood beside an
open grave. Behind us stretched rows of crosses and white tomb
stones, but in our corner the place was ragged, untended,
unconsecrated. The priest was saying, 'And these are things that
only God understands.'</p>

<p>I slipped a comforting arm about Yvonne. She raised her dark,
tragic eyes and whispered, 'It was yesterday, Jack&mdash;just
yesterday&mdash;that he said to me, "Next winter you shall spend
in New Orleans, Yvonne." Just yesterday!'</p>

<p>I tried a wretched smile, but I could only stare mournfully at
her forlorn face, watching a tear that rolled slowly down her
right cheek, hung glistening there a moment, then was joined by
another to splash unregarded on the black bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>That was all but how could I describe that vision to old de
N&eacute;ant? I tried to evade. He kept insisting.</p>

<p>'There wasn't any hint of the way,' I told him.
Useless&mdash;at last I had to tell anyway.</p>

<p>He was very silent for a full minute. 'Jack,' he said finally,
'do you know when I said that to her about New Orleans? This
morning when we watched the snow. This morning!'</p>

<p>I didn't know what to do. Suddenly this whole concept of
remembering the future seemed mad, insane. In all my memories
there had been not a single spark of real proof, not a single
hint of prophecy.</p>

<p>So I did nothing at all but simply gazed silently as old
Aurore de N&eacute;ant walked out of the room. And when, two
hours later, while Yvonne and I talked, he finished writing a
certain letter and then shot himself through the heart&mdash;why,
that proved nothing either.</p>

<p>It was the following day that Yvonne and I, his only mourners,
followed old Dawn of Nothingness to his suicide's grave. I stood
beside her and tried as best I could to console her, and roused
myself from a dark reverie to hear her words.</p>

<p>'It was yesterday, Jack&mdash;just yesterday&mdash;that he
said to me, "Next winter you shall spend in New Orleans, Yvonne".
Just yesterday!'</p>

<p>I watched the tear that rolled slowly down her right cheek
hung glistening there a moment, then was joined by another to
splash on the black bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>But it was later, during the evening, that the most ironic
revelation of all occurred. I was gloomily blaming myself for the
weakness of indulging old de N&eacute;ant in the mad experiment
that had led, in a way, to his death.</p>

<p>It was as if Yvonne read my thoughts, for she said
suddenly:</p>

<p>'He was breaking, Jack. His mind was going. I heard all those
strange things he kept murmuring to you.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'I listened, of course, behind the door there. I never left
him alone. I heard him whisper the queerest things&mdash;faces in
a red fog, words about a cold grey desert, the name Pyroniva, the
word Termopolis. He leaned over you as you sat with closed eyes
and he whispered, whispered all the time.'</p>

<p>Irony of ironies! It was old de N&eacute;ant's mad mind that
had suggested the visions! He had described them to me as I sat
in the sleep of lethargy!</p>

<p>Later we found the letter he had written and again I was
deeply moved. The old man had carried a little insurance. Just a
week before he had borrowed on one of the policies to pay the
premiums on it and the others. But the letter &mdash;well, he had
made <i>me</i> beneficiary of half the amount! And the
instructions were&mdash;</p>

<p>'You, Jack Anders, will take both your money and Yvonne's and
carry out the plan as you know I wish.'</p>

<p>Lunacy! De N&eacute;ant had found the way to provide the money
but&mdash; I couldn't gamble Yvonne's last dollar on the scheme
of a disordered mind.</p>

<p>'What will we do?' I asked her. 'Of course the money's all
yours. I won't touch it.'</p>

<p>'Mine?' she echoed. 'Why, no. We'll do as he wished. Do you
think I'd not respect his last request?'</p>

<p>Well, we did. I took those miserable few thousands and spread
them around in that sick December market. You remember what
happened, how during the spring the prices skyrocketed as if they
were heading back toward 1929, when actually the depression was
just gathering breath.</p>

<p>I rode that market like a circus performer. I took profits and
pyramided them back and, on April 27th, with our money multiplied
fifty times, I sold out and watched the market slide back.</p>

<p>Coincidence? Very likely. After all, Aurore de N&eacute;ant's
mind was clear enough most of the time. Other economists
predicted that spring rise. Perhaps he foresaw it too. Perhaps he
staged this whole affair just to trick us into the gamble, one
which we'd never have dared risk otherwise. And then when he saw
we were going to fail from lack of money he took the only means
he had of providing it.</p>

<p>Perhaps. That's the rational explanation, and yet&mdash;that
vision of ruined Termopolis keeps haunting me. I see again the
grey cold desert of the floating fungi. I wonder often about the
immutable Law of Chance and about a ghostly Jack Anders somewhere
beyond eternity.</p>

<p>For perhaps he does&mdash;did&mdash;will exist. Otherwise, how
to explain that final vision? What of Yvonne's words beside her
father's grave? Could he have foreseen those words and whispered
them to me? Possibly. But what, then, of those two tears that
hung glistening, merged and dropped from her cheeks?</p>

<p><i>What of them?</i></p>
