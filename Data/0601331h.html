<h2>1 - A WEDDING FIASCO</h2>

<h4>1921</h4>

<p>VICTOR HAD REFUSED his bride at the altar! That was the brute fact
which agitated the little party in the vestry. No amount of explanation
could mitigate it. As best man I had been in a good position to observe
events; and even I, who had formerly been fairly intimate with Victor,
was completely taken by surprise. True, I had long suspected that there
was something queer about him; but up to the very moment of his quietly
shattering remark, as he put the ring into his pocket, I had no idea
that anything serious was amiss.</p>

<p>James Victor Cadogan-Smith, later to be known as plain Victor Smith,
had seemed the ideal bridegroom. He was the son of a successful
colonial administrator who had climbed by his own ability from a very
lowly position, and had recently acquired a knighthood. The family had
been humble "Smiths" until Victor's father had married the only child
of a more aristocratic family, and had agreed to splice his wife's name
to his own.</p>

<p>The new "Cadogan-Smith" assured his friends that he had done this
mainly to please his father-in-law. But in later life he used to say,
"In those days my snobbery was unconscious."</p>

<p>His son Victor was born in 1890. He was now a bridegroom of thirty-
one, and certainly a catch for any girl. Looking at him in his wedding
clothes, one could not help using the clich&eacute; "every inch a
gentleman". His financial prospects were excellent. He was already
reputed to be one of the most brilliant young business men of his city,
and he was well established as a junior partner in a great shipping
firm. Victor had come through the Great War, as we called it in those
days, undamaged and with a Military Cross; and now, in the brief period
of optimism that followed the war, it seemed that he had excellent
prospects of working out for himself a triumphant business career in
the phase of post-war recovery. To crown all, he had secured as his
bride the charming daughter of the head of his firm.</p>

<p>The wedding celebrations had been planned in appropriate style. The
only factor which was not in perfect harmony with the spirit of the
occasion, I fear, was the best man. I had been greatly flattered by
Victor's request that I should fill this office, but I could not help
wondering why he had not asked one of his many more presentable
friends. His subsequent behaviour toward me almost suggested that he
regretted his choice. Certainly I did not fit at all into the picture
of a smart wedding; and from the moment when I found that I should have
to hire a conventional wedding garment my heart had failed me. Victor
must have found me a very inefficient manager, for he had to re-arrange
almost everything that I had undertaken. I knew, of course, that in one
of his moods he had sometimes an almost obsessive passion for
correctness, but I had been surprised and exasperated by his meticulous
scrutiny of every detail of our clothing and of the time- table of the
honeymoon tour.</p>

<p>At the church, Victor's erect and perfectly tailored figure had
seemed the very pattern of orthodoxy; and Edith, I am sure, must have
been admired by the whole congregation as the ideal bride, so "radiant"
was she (yes, that is the fatally right word), and so expensively
adorned.</p>

<p>I remember I was rather surprised when the bridegroom suddenly
scratched his head, as though in perplexity, and began looking about
him in a frank, inquisitive manner that seemed out of keeping with the
occasion. And perhaps it was not quite seemly suddenly to turn his face
full upon the lovely creature at his side; but everyone must have
readily forgiven him, since his expression suggested great tenderness.
I remember noticing that his eyelids, normally inclined to droop, so
that his face wore the drowsy look of a lion in captivity, were now
fully raised. His blue eyes gazed with a vitality--yes, and a warmth of
feeling--which I had never before seen in them. "Such," I thought, "is
the power of love." But the words had scarcely formed themselves in my
mind, when Victor cut into the rector's solemn recitative in a voice
that was unusually gentle but also unusually decisive. "Edith," he
said, "we mustn't go on with this. I've-I've just waked up, and I see
quite clearly that I am not the one for you, nor you for me."</p>

<p>For a moment, silence. The bride stared at the bridegroom like a
startled hind, then let herself be hurried away on her father's arm.
Victor, protesting his contrition, and offering to explain himself,
followed the outraged bridal party into the vestry, with me upon his
heels, and behind me his own distressed father.</p>

<p>When the door was shut, the bride's father turned on Victor with
indignation, spluttering of breach of promise. Her mother attempted to
console her. Edith herself was very properly in tears; but also,
through streaming eyes, she stared at Victor with such an expression of
fascinated terror that I looked to see what could have caused it.
Certainly it seemed a new Victor that took charge of this very awkward
situation. Except for the fact that he sometimes tugged at his collar
and mopped the sweat from his face, he behaved with complete composure.
He looked from one to the other of us all with a curious intensity and
exhilaration, almost as though it was we that had changed, and he must
size us up afresh. Presently in a tone of authority that silenced the
rest of us he said, "Listen to me for a minute! I know I can't ever put
things right after the mess I have made, but I'll do whatever I can.
Anyhow, I must try to explain. Standing there in these damned silly
clothes and listening to the rector, I--well, as I said, I just woke up
from a sort of dream. I saw Edith and me as we really are, me a young
snob without a mind, and Edith--well, she's good to look at, very" (he
smiled ruefully at her), "and what's more, underneath all the
conventional trappings of her mind there's something sensitive and
honest; yes, and much too good for me, for that drowsy snob. In my
dream-life I really did think I was in love with her, but I wasn't
really, even then, and I'm certainly not now." He was watching Edith,
and an expression of pain passed over his face as he said, "God! What a
mess! Edith, I know I have hurt you horribly, but I have saved you from
something far worse, from marrying that somnambulant snob."</p>

<p>No one had supposed Victor capable of talking like this. Or no one
but myself. To me, though the whole incident had of course been very
surprising, it had not seemed entirely out of keeping with certain
events in the past; particularly so, when Victor turned from Edith to
me with a special smile. It was a twisted smile, half quizzical but
wholly amiable, which in the old days I had learnt to regard as
revealing the true Victor, but had lately missed. The smile faded into
a grave and steady gaze, while he said to the company, "Harry, here,
perhaps knows what I mean, partly." This remark turned the attention of
the three parents upon me, and I could feel them blaming me for
Victor's shocking deed. Victor's father looked at his son, then back at
me, and the look said as clearly as words could have done, "My boy, why
did you get tangled up with this fellow? He's not one of us. And now,
see where he has led you!" At this point Edith brought the scene to a
close by imploring her parents to take her home.</p>

<h2>2 - VICTOR'S EARLY LIFE</h2>

<h4>From 1890 to 1912</h4>

<p>THAT SAME AFTERNOON, while I was in my bedroom at the hotel, packing
my hired clothes, and wondering how Victor was dealing with the
parents, he came in dressed in an old tweed coat and flannels. He flung
himself into the easy chair and said, "Thank God, oh, thank God, that's
over I How wise of me, quite unconsciously wise, to fetch you along to
be best man. You were a sort of touchstone, or the alarm clock that
woke me."</p>

<p>While I was pondering this, and mechanically packing, he changed the
subject. "Harry, old man," he said, "don't go home yet, unless you
must. The least I can do after getting you into this mess is to tell
you more about myself. It's rather urgent, because I may go back into
my sleep-life at any minute. If you can spare a few hours, let's walk
somewhere."</p>

<p>This suggestion itself was surprising, Victor normally despised the
humblest form of physical exercise. Tennis, rugger, swimming, he
enjoyed; and in all of them he was competent, in some brilliant.
Walking he regarded as a mug's game. It was a means of transport to be
resorted to only when his sports car was off the road.</p>

<p>And now, though the car was available to take us quickly into open
country, he asked me, rather sheepishly, if I should mind going by bus.
Sensing my surprise, he added, "You see, the car means the other life,
the sleep-walker's life, and so it--well, it gives me the creeps."</p>

<p>How I remember that bus journey of nearly thirty years ago! The bus
was crowded, and we had to stand. The solid tyres chattered our teeth
together like dice in a box. When the conductor came for our fares,
Victor surprised me by muddling the transaction. The conductor, with
unspoken contempt, handed back the superfluous coins. Victor looked at
them, not with the shame of the business man who had fallen short of
the sacred virtue of business efficiency, but with a laugh which seemed
to express relief at his own carelessness. He then became entirely
absorbed in watching our fellow passengers, with the same wide-eyed
fascination as he had displayed in the vestry. He stared so hard and so
unselfconsciously that people began to grow restive and resentful. He
was particularly attentive to a comfortable body with an amiable face,
who finally remarked with an attempt at severity, "Young man, control
your eyes!" Suddenly realizing that he was not behaving correctly,
Victor chuckled and said in a breezy voice, "Sorry I You mustn't mind
me. I've been--well I've been asleep for several months, and it's so
exciting to see people again; real people, and not just dreams." A
florid man, who evidently considered himself a wag, remarked, "They've
let you out too soon, lad. If I were you I'd take the next bus back."
There was a general titter. Victor grinned; then winked, as he nudged
me and said, "It's all right. My keeper's with me."</p>

<p>At the terminus we set out along a suburban street that presently
became more like a country road. Then came a path through woods and
fields. At last Victor began to tell me the strange facts about himself
which threw light not only on his conduct at the church but also on my
earlier relations with him. But while part of his mind was occupied
with recounting his biography, another part seemed to be intensely
concentrated in his senses. With alert eyes he looked about him at the
scenery. Sometimes he would stop to examine a leaf or a beetle as
though he had never seen such a thing before, or pause at a stile to
run his fingers curiously, lovingly, along the grain of the wood, or
dabble his hand in a stream with childish delight, or sniff the
complicated fragrance of a handful of earth. Once, when a woodpecker
called, he stood still to listen. "What's that bird?" he asked. "What a
lot I miss in my sleep-life!"</p>

<p>All this was notable enough in itself, but far more so to anyone who
knew Victor's customary indifference to all, such commonplace
experiences. Normally his interest was almost wholly limited to motors,
sport, business, feminine charm, and the stability of society. His only
other subject was human character, which he judged with a quick eye for
a man's less reputable motives, and no eye at all for his personality
as a whole. This, at least, was the case with Victor in his normal
mood; but if this had been the whole Victor, I should never have grown
to admire him.</p>

<p>I shall report as much as I can reconstruct of our memorable
conversation on that walk, but probably I shall fail to convey my vivid
impression of Victor's quickened vitality and intelligence, or the
sense of his anxiety to make full use of his brief spell of lucidity
while it lasted. However, I shall not miss any important facts, for I
subsequently persuaded him to help me to write fairly full notes about
all that he told me.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, plunging at the root of the matter, "I am
apparently some sort of divided personality, but a queer sort; and up
to today I have never said a word about it to anyone. My first waking
up, so far as I know, was at my prep school. It was only a half-waking,
and it lasted only for a minute or I so, but it was something
startlingly new to me. I had been, charged with circulating smutty
drawings, and really I hadn't even seen the things. The Head lectured
me on smut and on lying, and then whacked me. The whacking stung me
into life, or stung me awake. After about the third stroke the pain
suddenly became much more violent than it had been, and I began to
yell, having been the proper little silent Englishman up to that point.
I bolted for the door, but the Head caught me. For a moment we faced
one another, he with a horrible look that I couldn't understand at the
time, but it seemed all wrong. It reminded me of our dog when I found
him guzzling a beefsteak in the larder, growling hideously while he
went on gulping the stuff down. I was so startled by the Head's new
face that I let out a throat-breaking scream, and tried to bash him on
the nose. You see, faces had been just masks before that waking, and
now here was one that turned into a window with a soul looking out of
it, and a soul (I vaguely felt) in a very terrible state. I remember
quite distinctly feeling all in a flash that God almighty had turned
out to be just a filthy monster. I yelled out 'Beast! Why do you like
hurting me?' Then I think I must have fainted, for I can't remember
anything more. Needless to say, I was expelled."</p>

<p>Victor fell silent, contemplating the past with his twisted smile.
When I asked him whether the waking came often after that incident, he
remained silent. We were now leaning over the rail of a footbridge
above a stream, and Victor was all the while intently watching several
fishes that were dimly visible in the dark water.</p>

<p>"My mind," he suddenly said, "is like this stream. When I am my real
self it's clear right to the bottom, with all sorts of live things
moving about at different levels. When I am that I thick-headed snob,
the water is muddy. Awake, I can look down into my mind and see every
little minnow of a desire, every little sprat of a thought, busily
nosing about, feeding and growing, or fading into old age, or being
hunted down and swallowed up by stronger creatures. Yes, and when I am
fully awake, I can not only see them but control them, tame them, order
them, all to do as I will, make them dance to my tune; 'I' being always
a something outside the water, or floating on its surface. The image
breaks down, but perhaps you see what I mean. In the dream-life I am
the sport of those creatures (or at least of some of them) that come
nosing up through the opaque water, pushing me hither and thither with
the swirl of their lashing tails, and sometimes threatening to swallow
me, my real self. In fact, they do sometimes completely swallow my real
self. Over and over again I have simply been completely identified with
one or other of those brutes. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Partly," I said; and again I asked if the waking state happened
often.</p>

<p>"Not often, but more frequently as time goes on. And it tends to
last longer, and also to be more thorough." He sighed, and said,
"Perhaps some day I shall be permanently awake. But I hardly dare hope
for that. For the present, full waking comes seldom, and never lasts
long, just long enough to get me into the most distressing scrapes, and
then, let the wretched dreamer suffer for it. Once, when I was about
seventeen, I woke when I was persecuting some miserable fag. I was
taking a high moral line with him over some very small crime of his,
and leading sadistically up to a thrashing. Suddenly I saw the kid as a
live human person, and at the same time I caught a terrifying glimpse
of myself as the cad I was. I saw as clear as daylight what was
happening in my own mind. The affair with the Head of my prep. school
had roused an ugly monster from some dark cranny at the bottom of the
river, and this creature had been ranging about ever since, devouring a
lot of harmless small-fry, and growing fat and strong, unseen under the
muddy water. The sudden waking seemed to be due to the commotion caused
by this brute even on the surface of my mind. The danger woke me, and
in a flash I saw right down into the depths. I can remember the
unendurable shame of waking to find myself behaving so disgustingly. I
forget exactly what happened in consequence. But I can remember being
so upset that I said, 'Gosh I How you must hate me, Johnson minor, and
quite right too!' Then I actually wrote a note telling him if ever he
saw me being a cad again he must remind me how, when I did it before, I
woke up and was sorry. I signed the thing and gave it him. Naturally
the kid was bewildered by my sudden change, and frightened, I think.
But he took the note: Well, a few days later he had an excellent
opportunity of using it, and he did use it. In my somnolent, doltish
phase, I couldn't remember a thing about the earlier, awake phase. When
he showed me the note I had written and signed, I was confident it was
a forgery. Of course I was furious. And of course I regarded his
behaviour as insufferable cheek. With great gusto I whacked him.
Naturally this incident was soon known to the whole school. I used to
be frightfully popular, being good at games and correct about school
etiquette. But this affair broke my popularity completely. Everyone
despised and distrusted me. And as popularity was my ruling passion
(though I didn't know it), I went through agonies trying to restore my
position. Sometimes I half succeeded. But always, just when everything
seemed going well, I would wake up for a few minutes and do something
outrageous, so that the fat was in the fire all over again."</p>

<p>Victor fell silent, gazing down into the stream, with folded arms on
the rail of the bridge. Suddenly he stood upright, with a laugh that
was also a sigh, stretching himself as though in relief after some kind
of bondage. We moved along the path. "Tell me," I said, "when you say
you saw the kid as a live human person, what do you really mean?
Telepathy?"</p>

<p>"No, no I Perhaps telepathy may have something to do with it
sometimes, but mainly it's just a heightening of imaginative insight.
The other person's tone of voice and facial expression, the whole smell
of him, so to speak, suddenly flash a meaning at me. Johnson minor
suddenly became a vivid picture of a desperately perplexed and
frightened little person. And also I saw myself with the same
imaginative penetration. I saw myself as he saw me, and indeed very
much more clearly than he could possibly have seen me."</p>

<p>"You see," he said, looking round at me with an open smile which was
impossible to the normal Victor, "it's not only other people that come
clear, and not only my own mind, but everything. To pursue the
metaphor, not only the stream turns limpid, but the banks, the fields,
the people in them, the sky, the whole universe become--yes, limpid. I
see into everything, in a sense. Not, of course, spatially, like X-
rays. Not mystically either, seeing God in them, or what not. Rather,
instead of being just coloured shapes, they become bewilderingly
pregnant symbols; pregnant with whatever was relevant to them in my
past experience. That's it! The wretched Johnson minor's puckered brows
and quivering lip suddenly flooded me with all my forgotten experience
of such things, and with anew, shattering insight into their meaning in
terms of the mental suffering of Johnson himself, there and then."</p>

<p>I think it was at this point that Victor bent down to watch a
violent drama that had staged itself in a cobweb strung between the
tall grasses beside our path. But he did not stop talking. "Sometimes,"
he said, "I seem able to trace the waking to some event outside myself.
It's the impact of experience that shakes me into life--Johnson minor's
struggle not to blub, or the conjunction of you and Edith and the
marriage service. The sight of this spider preparing its dinner might
do the trick, if ever my sleep-walking self could stoop to notice such
things. God I what a spectacle it is, isn't it!" He jerked out an
almost frightened laugh. "See how he's tying up the wretched fly like a
struggling parcel! Over and over the string goes, and tighter and
tighter. And the poor devil goes on buzzing, steadily as a machine. Ha!
There's one of his wings roped now. And he's getting tired. It's like
catching a lion in a net in the Sahara, or one of those gladiatorial
duels with net and sword. Now the whole string bag is finished, and
next comes the feasting."</p>

<p>Another question occurred to me. "When you slipped back into the
dream-life after the Johnson minor incident, you had no idea (as you
said) of what had happened in the wide-awake state. Then, is the waking
state also vague about the events of the dreaming state. For instance,
have you now forgotten what happened before you 'woke' in the church
this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" He laughed rather bitterly. "In the wide-awake life I
remember the sleep-walker life with most distressing clarity, and often
in far more detail than the somnambulist could notice when things were
actually happening. I remember it all not only more clearly but in a
new light, from a new angle. For instance, I remember damning you
brutally yesterday because you had booked us several three-star hotels
instead of the four-star ones I had demanded for the honeymoon tour.
And I remember, too, what I did not notice at the time, namely that
your look of contrition had also a tinge of disgust and contempt about
it. Now, of course, my outburst fills me with unutterable shame. At
least it does, and it doesn't; because when I look harder at the memory
it doesn't really seem mine at all, not something I did, but something
that stupid snob did, who shares my body. Then again, I remember saying
'good-night' to Edith on the evening before the wedding. The
greedy-respectful kiss, and the soapy remarks! Now, it makes me
shudder, both for myself and for her. I wonder just how much damage
that fool somnambulist has done to her. What I did to her, breaking off
the match, was just the pain of a necessary operation. It had to be.
(But, oh, I hope she gets through with it quickly.) What he did was to
keep on for months poisoning her with his insincerity and false values.
Yes! The memory of last night's 'goodnight' makes me go hot all over.
Then, I (if I must say 'I' and not 'he') thought of myself as the
romantic lover, worshipping the beloved as a being of superior calibre,
almost divine; and ready to live for her all the rest of my life. But
looking back, I see precisely what was happening in my mind, and it's
not at all edifying. Of course there was plenty of good healthy
physical lust for Edith's extremely seductive body; but it was
presented to the somnambulist not as lust at all but as the physical
consequence of my adoration of her pure spirit. Now, it makes me
squirm. And what sort of a pure Spirit has she, poor girl? No doubt,
deep down inside her there's a little smothered germ of honesty and
generosity, the true and pure Edith. But it hardly ever manages to
express itself, because of the loads of false conventions and false
values overlying it. And while I was protesting my selfless devotion to
her as a person, what I was actually thinking (though I didn't notice
it) was that she was an excellent match for me, well trained in all the
antics of our sort of people, perhaps rather 'better class' than
myself, thoroughly presentable, something to show off with complacency.
But far from worshipping her, I felt that I was definitely better stuff
in away, and that she was really only raw material for me to work up
into a first-class partner. Sometimes, for instance, she had shown a
tendency to think for herself. That sort of thing mustn't be allowed.
Her function was to be the adoring and helpful wife."</p>

<p>He paused, then concluded, "So you see my wide-awake self does very
clearly remember the experiences of the other. If it didn't it wouldn't
have any background at all. It would be merely an infant mind. The
actual sum of its existence has been far shorter than the other's."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it's never active for more than a few minutes or
hours?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes days, even weeks; and it's spells grow longer as I grow
older. For the present, at any rate. But I can't help fearing that the
general stiffening thatt sets in in middle age will reverse the
process. Now let me get back to my story. My first really important
spell of wide-awake living was brought on by you, in our third year at
Oxford, when we first got to know each other."</p>

<p>"Now," I interrupted, "I understand why you were so inconsequent;
first stand-offish, then friendly, then cold again."</p>

<p>"It began," he said, "after that bump supper, when some of us, all a
bit tight, invaded your room. Instead of taking it lying down, you had
the cheek to make a fuss, so we began chucking things out of the window
into the quad. You actually put up a fight, which was surprising and
amusing, because we had always regarded you as a worm. You had come
from some bloody little unheard-of grammar school, and you had an
accent like the mud on a provincial street. We weren't going to stand
cheek from that sort. No doubt you remember, when you were being I held
down, I stared at you as offensively as I could, and said you reminded
me of my hosier. It was then that I came awake. It was your pinched
little face that did it. Instead of seeing you as just a type, and a
despised type, I suddenly saw you, as I had seen Johnson minor. Somehow
I saw you being torn between contempt for us all and irrational envy
and self-abasement. And I saw how horribly hurt you were, not simply by
our brutality but by your own involuntary treason to yourself."</p>

<p>Interrupting Victor, I said, "I can distinctly remember how your
face suddenly changed. Your eyes opened wide with surprise, and your
mouth too. Then you turned away with an odd, awkward little laugh. You
picked up a book, and sat on the arm of the easy chair, apparently
reading."</p>

<p>"Yes, but really I was just feeling mortally ashamed."</p>

<p>"Then suddenly you shut the book, gently, and laid it on the table,
and said something about this being pretty caddish, really, and what
about stopping it. Then there was an argument, but finally your gang
took itself off; and you--it struck me as odd at the time-stayed behind
to help me clear up the mess. Remember? First I tried to push you off
with the others, and then when you began to go, meek as a lamb, I
suddenly changed my mind. What a grind it was, wasn't it, fetching the
damaged books and furniture from the quad up the staircase to the top
floor."</p>

<p>"Yes, and when we had finished, you offered me cocoa! Cocoa! My God!
To me, who considered myself one of the bloods! But I had the sense to
accept, for I was thoroughly awake by then. And it was a damned good
drink, too. And we sat there talking till the small hours, till you
nearly fell asleep. Then I borrowed your Bateson's Heredity and took it
off to my own room. By breakfast time I had just about finished it.
That first talk we had was an eye-opener to me. Do you remember how we
leapt about from heredity to socialism, religion, astronomy, like a
couple of monkeys swinging from branch to branch. Monkeying with the
universe! You had the advantage of far greater knowledge, and I had an
absolutely fresh, innocent zest."</p>

<p>"And a diabolical quick-wittedness," I added, "an intelligence that
frightened me."</p>

<h2>3 - BEGINNINGS OF OUR FRIENDSHIP</h2>

<h4>From 1908 to 1912</h4>

<p>AT THIS POINT I shall interrupt my account of my conversation with
Victor on his abortive wedding day to tell, mainly in my own words,
about my relations with him at Oxford.</p>

<p>During the rest of the term I saw a good deal of him. We made
expeditions on Cumnor Hill. We punted on the Cher. We sat up late in my
room or his, talking about everything under the sun, and far beyond
it.</p>

<p>The set with whom Victor normally consorted, the bloods and their
hangers-on, found his sudden interest in a colourless nobody from a
secondary school quite inexplicable, and ridiculous. It was assumed
that the big fair athlete had conceived a more than platonic friendship
for the small dark bookworm. I myself was as puzzled as anyone by
Victor's interest in me, and still more puzzled by his violent thirst
for knowledge. It was all so inconsistent with everything that I had
known of him before. On the very few occasions when our ways had,
crossed he had overawed me with that "self- satisfied air of effortless
superiority" which was supposed to be characteristic of our college.
And though later I was to learn from the awakened Victor that this
imposing demeanour of his was just a carefully cultivated affectation
concealing a bewildered and morally timid self, in those early days it
Impressed me; and at the same time exasperated me against myself for
being cowed by an assurance which I vaguely felt to be meretricious.
But on that memorable evening, when we first talked seriously together,
Victor's manner suggested an unselfconscious modesty. In the subsequent
weeks of our increasingly close friendship I was often put to shame by
the intellectual humility that accompanied even his most penetrating
remarks. I set out to be his mentor in his new-found interests, but to
my chagrin I found that in many ways it was he that was the leader in
our mental partnership. Far from being merely the superficially clever
but unoriginal mind that I had supposed him to be, he soared far beyond
me in sheer imaginative power; and this in spite of the fact that at
the outset he was ludicrously ignorant of the spheres of knowledge that
seemed to me most important. Previously I had written him off as one of
those glib intelligences that could, indeed, easily amass enough of
Greek and Latin literature to secure a First in Honour Mods, but had
neither the curiosity nor the power of vision to explore the living,
growing tissue of human culture. Not only so, but he had always seemed
a thoroughly hidebound and insensitive personality. Though in his own
set he had a reputation for shrewd character-judgment, it had always
seemed to me that he had merely a certain slickness in docketing his
acquaintances according to their obvious failings, often ticking them
off with some Latin or Greek quotation. And generally the
classification which he adopted implied that there was one correct
type, and that all others were more or less ridiculous aberrations. Of
course, the correct type was the ideal of complacent gentility which he
and his set embodied, and to which the rest of us, in spite of our
better judgment, vainly aspired. Never, so far as I know, had Victor
shown any sign of realizing any human being as a living and unique
person. Never did he greet any sincere expression of anyone's authentic
personality otherwise than with derision or an uncomprehending and
insolent stare.</p>

<p>Such was the James Victor Cadogan-Smith that I had known, from afar
and had apparently so shockingly misjudged. For now, after the invasion
of my room, and during the following few months, I came into contact
with a mind that extended sensitive antennae toward every acquaintance,
and seemed magically aware of the other's ever-changing moods. For my
new friend was earnestly, constantly, almost feverishly, absorbed in
exploring every aspect of experience, and above all every aspect of
human nature and human society.</p>

<p>His interest in myself, of course, was largely due to my
comparatively wide knowledge of fields which he had formerly ignored.
For, though officially I was reading history, I made time for a great
deal of general reading, and my interest had led me into regions that
were in those days little explored by Oxford undergraduates. Not only
was I an ardent admirer of the early Wells; I was also reading Freud
with more enthusiasm than judgment. The advancing study of heredity
also fascinated me. In philosophy and social thought Bertrand Russell
was opening many new windows for me. Karl Marx, too, I had discovered;
and his strictly sociological attitude I counterbalanced with a half-
guilty addiction to popular astronomy.</p>

<p>These fields were all apparently new to Victor. Under my guidance he
entered them with a childlike zest, a power of assimilation which I
envied, and a critical acumen which I could not always at the time
appreciate. Again and again I dismissed as unimportant some suggestion
of his which, years afterwards, turned out to be sound. The case of
Freud was specially significant. Victor apparently felt none of the
horror and fascination with which most new readers of the great pioneer
greeted his theory of sex and of unconscious motivation. He was merely
intrigued, and demurely amused at the general uproar. On the other hand
he never plunged into unquestioning partizanship, as I myself had done.
He seemed to leap at once to the more detached and balanced attitude
which most of us were to arrive at twenty or twenty- five years
later.</p>

<p>Even in theoretical matters, then, where I was supposed to be the
leader, Victor often went ahead of me, but in the sphere of personal
contacts his leadership was unmistakable. His "feminine intuition", as
I called it, expressed itself sometimes in devastating but never
vindictive comments on his own friends and mine, and in sudden probings
into my own dark heart. His exposures were often painful, but somehow I
could never seriously resent them. His uncanny awareness of my
unacknowledged motives often stung me to indignant denial; but a minute
later, or a day or a week, or in some cases not till middle age, I had
to admit to myself that he was right. The entirely unself- righteous
way in which he delivered these judgments was disarming. Once when he
had been telling me of a tennis victory, and I had duly congratulated
him, he looked silently at me, grinned broadly, punched me amiably in
the chest, and said, "Damn it! You're grudging me my poor little
triumph. You're wishing I had been beaten. Just as I wished you hadn't
won that essay prize. Or rather, a sneaking spiteful bit of me
did."</p>

<p>His power of imaginative insight and sympathy varied a good deal
from day to day. Sometimes I found with relief that he had missed (or
had not troubled to notice) some ungenerous impulse of mine. On the
other hand there were occasions when, having scrutinized me steadily
for a while, he would break in on some pronouncement of mine with, "No,
no! You're not really feeling that way about it. You're merely feeling
you ought to feel that way."</p>

<p>It was this heightened personal consciousness that brought me so
greatly into Victor's debt. For under his influence I was gradually
forced to become aware of depth beyond depth of mental activity.
Priding myself on my honesty and self-criticism, I discovered that I
had all along been deceiving myself. As a good Freudian I accepted the
theory of unconscious motivation, but only in the abstract, not in
detailed application to myself. Now, without any special technique of
analysis, Victor made me aware that, for instance, under my noble
passion for truth lurked an impulse to impute dishonesty to others.
Under my social consciousness and my revolutionary zeal lay a purely
vindictive lust to see the "bloods" discomfited.</p>

<p>I became increasingly dependent on Victor's psychological insight,
on his intuitive power of analysing and cleansing the psyche; a power
far more effective than my own ill-digested psycho-analytical precepts.
I shall have more to say on this matter, but for the moment I merely
want to record that, if I was of any service to Victor in those early
days, he was far more helpful to me. He became my father confessor, but
without any assumption of spiritual superiority. The relationship was
always a man-to-man relationship, and nearly always tinged with humour.
Moreover, nine times out of ten it was by the example of his own
self-analysis that he led me to discover my own hidden depths. And
toward the primitive, submerged denizens of his own mind he felt no
shame but merely an amused interest. He knew that their antics could
never seriously disturb him, so long as he was in his awakened state;
and so he could watch them with scientific detachment. Friendly toward
the archaic fauna of his own mind, he was equally friendly toward the
more contemptible creatures that he fished up into the light from my
mind's turgid depths. And because he could regard them with such
composure, I myself grew able to face them without either horror or
inverted pride; and with some hope of disciplining them.</p>

<p>In one rather surprising respect Victor seemed to be my inferior. He
had a reputation for dash and pluck, both with the gloves and on the
rugger field; yet I found him childishly nervous at the prospect of
physical pain, and shattered by its actual presence. The task of taking
a splinter out of his hand was too much for him to face without the
stimulus of a spectator's ridicule; while the distress caused by the
splinter itself seemed to paralyse his mind. When I laughed over the
contrast of his present cowardice and his reputed hardihood, he let
slip a remark to which at the time I paid little attention, but on his
wedding day it became luminous. "Everything I nowadays becomes so
unendurably vivid." Not until long afterwards, in fact on his wedding
day, when he made his lengthy confession to me, did I learn that
Victor's awakened consciousness had two distinct phases, the one less,
the other more developed. In both there was that intensification of the
sensory life; but while in the commoner and less fully awakened phase
hyperaesthesia was an uncontrollable and devastating thing, in the
rarer and still more lucid state he had a strange power of regarding
the electric storm of his sensations (and indeed his whole intensified
passional life) with serene detachment, as though through the eyes of
some all-seeing all-feeling but utterly imperturbable deity. But in our
undergraduate days he never reached this height, and so he often laid
himself open to my friendly ridicule of his fastidiousness and his I
unmanly timidity. Friendly? On one occasion he retorted, smiling
through his distress, "Vindictive blighter! Under your taunting, of
course, there's your real kindliness, but under that again, you devil,
you're licking your lips."</p>

<p>For the rest of the term, and most of the next one, our friendship
developed, though spasmodically. And during that period Victor himself,
the awakened Victor, developed rapidly. Like a plant retarded by a cold
spring, and then suddenly crowding forth all its leaves and flowers,
his mind burgeoned with experience. His official studies suffered, but
he ate his way through the libraries, seizing upon everything that
promised light on his central problem, which was the problem of us all,
the problem of man and the universe. The rest, no matter how reputable,
he ignored, as a caterpillar ignores all but its own distinctive food.
In this feverish pursuit of wisdom (as he told me long afterwards on
his wedding day) he was goaded constantly by the knowledge that "death"
might seize him any day, the death of his awakened self into "that
somnambulent and loathsome snob".</p>

<p>He had one great advantage over the rest of us, namely that in the
wakened state he seldom needed more than two or three hours of sleep,
with an occasional indulgence to the extent of five. But it was
necessary for him to lie in bed for six or seven hours or so every
night to rest his body. All these unsleeping hours were therefore spent
in reading, or in "getting his thoughts in order". While the rest of us
were sunk in the archaic vegetative life, he would lie in bed
methodically going through his memories and re-assessing them. Vast
tracts of experience which the sleep-walker had allowed to slip into
oblivion were now available to him. Memories that were formerly the
vaguest and most illusive wraiths now presented themselves almost with
the detail of the original event. All this wealth of personal
experience had to be regarded afresh, from the point of view of the
awakened Victor. Its inner essence, untasted by the sleep-walker, had
to be pressed from it and assimilated.</p>

<p>All his nights, I said, were spent in this way; but no, for besides
book-learning and self-knowledge he needed other kinds of experience,
of which I must tell.</p>

<p>Freeing himself in a few weeks from all the inhibitions of his set,
his social class, and the historical moment, he seemed in a manner to
have rushed headlong by sheer imaginative power through much of the
cultural evolution which was to occupy his fellows for some twenty
years. Starting as a respectable Tory Christian who accepted without
question the moral code that had been imposed on him by his Victorian
parents, he now passed at a gallop through a kind of Liberal
Nonconformity, and on through Marxian Communism and Atheism, and before
he lapsed solidly back into the "sleep-walker" state he was already
groping beyond these. Thus in the second and third weeks of our
friendship he was affirming that, though the Christian doctrines were
sheer myth, he recognized in the universe "a power making for
righteousness". And though his eyes were opened to the hideous facts of
social injustice, and he was already taking on "social work" in a boys'
club, he still believed that the "great change" would come through the
leadership of a morally awakened middle class. Similarly, though
intellectually he recognized the wrong-headedness of nineteenth-century
sexual prudery, he was still emotionally bound up with it. But already
by the end of that term he was "breathing the cold exhilarating air of
atheism", seeking how best to devote his life to work for "the coming
proletarian revolution", and deliberately spurning the sexual
conventions to which his class paid lip-service even while it violated
them in actual conduct.</p>

<p>But later in his life, as I shall tell, he outgrew all these
attitudes, which he came to regard as adolescent.</p>

<p>During his last term at Oxford, and the second term of our
friendship, he must have pursued his sexual experiments very
thoroughly, for he was seldom available in the evenings; and though he
was reticent about his adventures, I know that he spent many nights
out, stealing back into college in the early morning by a climber's
route, up a drain- pipe and along a cornice.</p>

<p>At the time he told me nothing of his amatory life. I remember
noting, in his manner, when he must have been still fresh to them, a
new complacency, even defiance. "The bloods," he once said, "make a
great song about their dashing amours, but nearly always they're
mythical. Those who do it, hold their tongues; those who daren't,
brag." On another occasion he said, "To talk against the taboos is
merely to stand shivering on the springboard. It's the act that
counts." A few weeks later I became aware that Victor's mood had
changed. Exhilaration had given place to despond, and an irritability
which he had not hitherto shown. And he seemed dissatisfied with many
of the ideas that we had recently agreed upon. He was already beginning
to poke fun at our confident atheism and to express doubts about the
all- importance of economic determinism. This shocked me, for at that
time I was coming increasingly under the influence of Marx, priding
myself on my lonely vision; for few undergraduates had even heard of
the prophet of Communism. I was shocked, too, by Victor's new sense
that Freud's gospel, also, was somehow insufficient. As a good Marxist,
I ought not to have minded this; but I had not yet reached the stage of
pushing either of my new faiths to the exclusion of the other.</p>

<p>Victor's doubts about Freud were not merely intellectual. While he
had often charged the great Viennese with a non sequitur in his
arguments, and had laughingly forgiven him, now he was more radically
critical. One evening (he was becoming more available in the evenings),
when we were deep in one of our usual discussions, smoking our pipes in
the armchairs before my fire, he made a long and disillusioned
confession. At first I put his gloominess down to mere physical
lassitude after his spell of concentrated debauchery. But it turned out
to be far more than the expression of a passing mood. With my usual
meticulous industry I jotted down all I could remember of Victor's
confession as soon as he had left me. Using those notes some
thirty-five years later, I must do my best to reconstruct his actual
words.</p>

<p>We had been discussing the importance of instinct, if I remember
rightly. Victor charged me with overestimating it. He rose from his
chair and walked about the room, like a caged lion. "It's all very
well," he said, "but if you had lived as I have lived in the last few
weeks you'd probably feel as I do. You probably know that I have been-
doing a bit of practical research in sex. Well, at first it was
magnificently refreshing to be free of the taboos. And the sense of
being animal-to-animal with a woman at last was somehow spiritually
fulfilling; though also, in my first experiment, hellishly torturing,
because we neither of us knew how to adapt to the other. We hadn't the
technique. After a few nights got her rhythm, so to speak, and things
went better. But presently I had to try another girl, and then Number
One cut up rough about it. She had sworn she wouldn't mind, because
there was no question of our being 'in love'; but I sensed that as a
matter of fact she was falling for me pretty thoroughly, which was one
reason why I tried Number Two. Number One was so terribly upset about
it that I felt perfectly bloody, because--well, in spite of Freud and
all that, just couldn't help feeling that I had messed up something
sacred. That in itself was a revelation. Freud seemed pretty foolish to
me then. As for her--well she'll get over it, of course, but with a
twist in her that need not have been there. O God! I feel foul about it
even now. And what could I do to mend matters but clear out? Which
seemed like running away. Well, the harm had been done, so I went on
with my research, more cautiously." Here Victor interrupted himself to
turn on me with an unusual sharpness, even contempt. "For God's sake,'"
he said "don't sit there oozing self-righteousness at me, and fairly
stinking of hypocrisy!" I had said nothing, and I was not consciously
feeling self-righteous; and if I was a hypocrite, I had deceived
myself. But I had been feeling a curiously violent distaste for
Victor's sexual adventures. And though I had carefully maintained a
fa&ccedil;ade of sympathetic interest, Victor's antennae had reached
behind it. "You accept Freud in theory," he said, "but when I set about
testing the theory in action you go emotionally Victorian." I could
only protest that, whatever tricks my old emotional habits might play
me, I was fully emancipated. Victor continued his story.</p>

<p>"My Number Two," he said, "was much older. She helped I me a lot.
She had style, and she taught me style, too. Each of us was a musical
instrument for the other to play on in the sex duet. It was exquisite
for a time, and I'll never forget her. But presently we began to know
one another better mentally. And like so many artists she had
practically nothing in her mind but her art, namely, love-making. At
first I didn't care. She did that so superlatively well, with touch and
voice and looks, that for a whole week I was in a sort of ecstasy. What
a thing touch can be, ranging from zephyrs to high-tension flashes! And
tone of voice! Like fingers rippling over all the keys of one's
emotions! And looks! The faint, faint changes of lips and eyelids! But
I'm wandering. What I wanted to say was--well, I was beginning to slip
back toward the somnambulist again. One night I actually fell asleep
with her. Before that I had stayed wide awake when she slept, with my
mind careering over the universe. Falling asleep warned me. Then I
began to realize that I was not properly awake even by day. The cutting
edge of my mind was not what it had been. And images of her kept
interrupting my thought. Her voice sang in my ears all day. Remembering
the feel of her body next mine made me gasp-like getting into a very
hot bath. I longed for night. I realized I had got properly caught in
my own experiment, but I didn't care. This was life, I said. But after
a few days I began to be frightened. Somehow our duet was no longer the
exquisite thing it had been, and yet I couldn't keep away from her. I
felt I wanted something more of her, and it was more than she had in
her to give. I told myself that though she was a superb executant she
was not a creative artist. But one night, instead of falling asleep
beside her, as I had recently done, I stayed fully awake, puzzling
desperately over the whole business. She was asleep. I listened to her
breathing. Presently I had a sort of revelation. Not a mystical
revelation, but a sudden flash of insight into the implications of my
own experience. You know those old puzzle pictures. There's a forest of
trees and undergrowth and rocks, and you're told to 'find the Red
Indian'. You turn it about, this way and that; there's nothing but what
you saw before. Then suddenly there he is, larger than life and clear
as your own hand. Well, in the same way I suddenly saw a new pattern in
my recent experience, the essential pattern. Suddenly I realized that I
was most desperately lonely. I realized with horrible clearness that,
in spite of all the delight we had had together, we were poles
apart."</p>

<p>"No, a bad metaphor that; because 'poles' are poles of some I one
thing, and we simply didn't make one thing together, really. Of course
we made our little perfect duet of love-making, but we weren't one
underneath that. The thing didn't express any deeper oneness. In a sort
of vision I felt what that oneness should be. I imagined myself lying
in bed with the right person. The feel of the whole thing would be
different, and the love-making would be not only perfect in technique
but perfect in meaning.' It would be a bodily union expressing unity
of--well, spirit, or personality. I mean--each mind contributing to the
other on every level, and reaching to a sort of stereoscopic vision,
seeing the world from two points of view but seeing it singly, and
seeing it solid. And the wider apart the two points of view, the
better; provided they fuse together. Now God, if there is one, must see
the world from every possible point of view, and yet see it singly. And
human love (real love, I mean) must be like that, though in a very
small way. How do I know? Not having loved, how do I know? I suppose I
must have extrapolated from the experiences I have had. For instance,
from knowing you, you queer fish. Well, next day I told all this to my
Number Two, hoping we should somehow get somewhere. She agreed,
verbally; but she didn't really understand at all. So the affair just
fizzled out, leaving me richer in a way, but horribly twisted, and
desperately lonely; hungry for the thing I couldn't have. And now I
realized that the whole approach was wrong. There's something in the
old conventions after all; if they weren't so rigid and prude, and so
tangled up with sheer snobbery. I mean, people keep the moral code of
sex (or pretend to) not because they really see that it's right, but
because they're afraid of losing caste. And when they come up against
someone who has violated it, generally they are not so much morally
outraged (though they pretend to be) as vindictive against someone who
is no longer one of us, and can therefore be persecuted, like a sick
animal by the herd."</p>

<p>I was impressed by Victor's change of attitude, but I could not
resist pointing out that Freud could give a very convincing account of
his dissatisfaction with his amours, simply in terms of repressed
infantile cravings. Unconsciously he was longing for his mother, and no
other woman could give him the peace and comfort that he demanded. Of
course, I admitted, it was not really quite as simple as that. The
psycho-analyst would be able to discover in him a vast mesh of past
experience leading inevitably to just the particular reaction which had
actually been manifested.</p>

<p>Victor was silent for a moment. Then he surprised me with a
curiously hearty laugh. It reminded me of an occasion in my boyhood
when my father and I had been completely lost in mist on the hills, and
were expecting to spend the night out, drenched and in a cutting wind.
Dusk was already far advanced, and we believed ourselves to be many
miles from the farm where we were staying. At last we found ourselves
going down hill in pitch darkness, into a strange valley. The mist
cleared a little, and far away we saw a light. After floundering
through hedges and over walls we reached the light, and found it was
the lamp in our own sitting-room window. My father's laugh of relief
and triumph was echoed now in Victor's.</p>

<p>"No!" he said, "Freud's sometimes too clever to see the truth. It's
like pre-Copernican astronomy. With enough epicycles you can make your
theory explain anything. But if you had been through my researches you
would see that Freud, brilliant and valuable as he is, has missed the
key to understanding the--well, the most developed, most conscious kind
of human relationships."</p>

<p>I was not convinced. But now, near my sixtieth year, I see what he
meant.</p>

<p>Henceforth, I believe, Victor refrained from continuing his sexual
researches. Instead he seemed to devote himself more earnestly to
research into society. Once more he was seldom available in the
evenings, because he was so frequently engaged at the Boys' Club, or at
political meetings and on other activities, not merely of undergraduate
societies but in the town, and occasionally in London. I soon came to
realize that, though he was very ready to talk about most of these
activities, something was afoot about which he was being secretive. He
told me quite freely that with the aid of a small group of
working-class acquaintances of his he was seeking first-hand experience
of the conditions of the poorer sections of society. He haunted pubs.
He was taken into houses in back streets, not as an officious social
worker, but as a friend of a friend of the family. And through his
extraordinary gift of imaginative insight into the minds of others he
was able to discover the right approach, so as to establish a genuinely
friendly relation. "The class barrier," he once said, "is like one of
those deep trenches that divide animals from spectators in the newest
sort of zoo. You can see each other quite clearly with nothing in the
way, and yet you can't possibly get at each other. At least, in the
human zoo you can make contact, but in one way only. You must be doing
something that puts you definitely on their side, not on ours. And you
must be able to convince someone on their side (whom they know to be
sound) that you really are doing it, that you mean business. Once you
have got yourself accepted by him, he can get you accepted everywhere.
You find yourself across the trench. You get into that other world of
theirs. Of course you're not really one of them. You can't possibly be.
But you'll be a welcome visitor instead of a bloody intruder. And if
you are quick in the uptake and a bit imaginative, you'll learn a lot,
oh, the hell of a lot! You'll learn their language, the language of
their minds, I mean. And you'll see 'us' looking mighty different from
what we look like to ourselves."</p>

<p>When I asked Victor what it was that he had been doing, that was a
passport to that other world, he looked at me hard and long, and said,
"I mustn't tell you."</p>

<p>It soon became clear that he was giving more and more of his time
and his thought to his exploration of the "other world ", and that he
was over-straining himself. I saw very little of him. It was as though
he were in a desperate hurry to finish some task before it was too
late. Long afterwards, on his wedding day, he told me that at this time
he was expecting to 'die' at any minute, to slip back irrevocably into
his normal sluggish state. He never knew whether, if he allowed himself
to sleep at night, he would wake up in the morning as himself or the
hated other. He was therefore desperately anxious to make the fullest
possible use of his remaining days or hours, or minutes. Whether
through the soporific influence of his recentdisappointing sexual
adventures, or through the actual strain of his new social exploration
itself, he was becoming subject to frequent lapses into a state of
drowsiness in which, though he was still (he said) at heart his
awakened self, histhoughts wandered and the desires and purposes of the
awakened self lost something of their power. In fact he was a little
red; and yet outraged by his own boredom. Sometimes, too, he caught
himself secretly fingering and even relishing memories of his own
unregenerate past. Occasionally he even made cautious advances to the
more human of his former friends.</p>

<p>For days at a time he would not come near me. If I sought him out, I
was generally received with a show of friendliness, but somehow
conversation flagged. None of the subjects which we usually discussed
with such zest seemed to have any significance for him. Often I
suspected that he had simply forgotten nearly everything connected with
our previous talk. I was shocked and bewildered by his lack of
intelligent grasp of the very problems which formerly his keen wit had
illuminated for me. Sometimes even superficial friendliness was allowed
to lapse. He would even speak with an affected "Oxford drawl", to shame
my North Country accent. In fact he would use every means short of
slamming the door in my face to make it clear that I was not wanted.
Yet, strangely, no sooner did he see that I was leaving than he blurted
out apologies, and excused himself on the plea of "feeling rotten", or
"having a thick head", or "being quite unfit for decent people to talk
to today". It was obvious that something queer had happened to him; but
I never suspected that the Victor who rebuffed me was a distinct
personality struggling to oust the Victor who was my friend.</p>

<p>One incident is worth recording. I went round to Victor's rooms to
return a book which he had left with me on the previous evening. I
found to my surprise that he had with him two of his former friends,
Biglands, prominent as a speaker in Union debates, and Moulton, a minor
aristocrat. All three were a bit sozzled. They were sitting round the
table, from which the cloth had been removed, playing a childish game
with pellets of bread. A whole loaf had been disembowelled to provide
the material for the dozens of bread-pills with which the game was
being played. The three of them were frantically blowing pellets across
the smooth table at one another. I was so surprised that I stood in the
doorway silent. Victor's face, red from much blowing, was itself a
playing-board where conflicting emotions struggled for mastery.
Presently he said, "Come in, Tomlinson, old man. We want a fourth
player. Have a drink, won't you?" The words were harmless; the drawling
voice was obviously meant to tell his companions that, though of course
he had to seem friendly to this wretched outsider with whom he had
somehow got himself entangled, he deplored the intrusion. "No, thanks,"
I said, and turned to go. With my hand on the door-knob, I heard
Victor's voice again, but this time its tone was altered. In a couple
of seconds, apparently, his temper had changed from bleak east wind to
bright warm sunlight. "Harry, don't go, please!" He had risen; and as I
turned, he took me gently by the arm, to lead me into the room. "I want
to make a public apology," he said, "for being offensive to you, Harry,
and for saying false and spiteful things about you before you came in."
Turning to the others, he added, "I'm sorry to be so inconsistent, but
before, I was not myself." A glance passed between Biglands and
Moulton, signifying that Cadogan-Smith was evidently still crazy.
Biglands rose with a bored look. Moulton sat tight, and said, "Very
well, C.S., give us some more beer and we'll have Tomlinson in the
game." Victor looked at the mess on the table for a moment. "No!" he
said. "If you don't mind, I think perhaps we had better stop." Victor
was looking extremely uncomfortable. He flashed an appeasing smile at
the couple. "I enjoyed the game," he said, "but now, in a new light, it
looks a bit silly. I mean, for people who are no longer kids. Oh, well!
Sorry, you two! Maybe we'll have a return match some time. But I really
must talk to Harry Tomlinson just now." He picked up a few pellets and
looked at them with an awkward little snigger. In a voice that
developed into a rapt recitative, he said, "People in America or
somewhere tilled the ground and sowed the seed. Rain, sun, wind. A
waving sea of corn to the horizon. People come with reaping machines,
working from dawn to dark. Stooks everywhere. Threshing machines. Grain
in railway trucks, and in elevators; poured into ships' holds. Wild
Atlantic weather. The look-out freezing and the stokers sweating.
Docking the ship. (Ticklish work. Like coaxing a shy horse.) More
trains. Mill hands hard at it in the mills. The corn becomes flour.
Some reaches the baker who serves this College. Dough. Lovely loaves.
One of them came here. And now look! God! I don't know what you fellows
feel but I feel a swine. Well, I started it." Biglands and Moulton had
looked very uncomfortable during this harangue. After it, Biglands
merely said, "O Christ, I'm going." His companion followed him.</p>

<p>One morning the college was fluttered by a rumour that Cadogan-Smith
was in gaol. Apparently he had been mixed up in a fight with the police
over in Cowley. It was no ordinary undergraduate brawl. Victor was the
only undergraduate, and his associates were said to be extremely
undesirable characters who were known to be ring-leaders in recent
disturbances at the factory. Rumour had it that the police had finally
tracked the culprits down to a certain house in the working- class
district, that a scuffle had followed, and that C.S. had given one of
the constables a black eye.</p>

<p>With great difficulty I managed to gain access to Victor while he
was in custody. It all sounded a pretty bad business, and probably he
would have to serve a term in gaol, so the least I could do was to see
if I could help him in any way. On my way to the police station I
wondered what mood I should find him in, whether exultant that he had
made a protest against social tyranny, or calm and self-contained. It
was a shock to find that he did not really want to see me as a friend
at all, though he was very ready to make use of me. It was a still
greater shock to find that he was thoroughly ashamed of his recent
escapade, and indignant with his accomplices for having enticed him
into it. He did not at the time divulge the fact that he had no memory
of the incident, and that all his scanty knowledge of it was gleaned
from his gaolers. His behaviour to me was so bewilderingly inconsistent
with his past attitude that I found myself completely at a loss. 1 felt
an odd sort of vertigo. Needless to say, I was hurt and angry, but I
told myself that, of course, the whole affair must have put him to a
great strain, and that he had momentarily lost his bearings. He looked
at me from under the drooping eyelids of a camel, I thought, and with a
camel's sulky pout. Yes, and with that air of aristocratic and
offensive superiority which camels innocently wear. When I tried to
make contact by leading the talk round to subjects formerly interesting
to us both, he looked at me in a puzzled and hostile way, casting
occasional anxious glances at the warder who was supervising our
meeting. When I referred to recent events in which he had shared, he
seemed to have only a very confused recollection of them. I tried to
get him to talk about the incident that had landed him in prison, but
he kept on saying, "Hell, hell! I must have been tight or mad or
something." The only thing that seemed to interest him was the hope of
gaining his liberty as quickly as possible. He implored me to go round
to certain big-wigs who, he thought, might be able to use their
influence to interfere with the normal process of the law and set him
free. He was desperately anxious to persuade these big-wigs that he was
not really a reprobate but a young man with generous though misguided
impulses who had got himself into a scrape through sheer love of
adventure. Naturally I felt very uncomfortable about his attitude. I
was ready to pull wires for him if I could, but I wished he had not
asked me to do so. It was a relief when, after staring silently at me
for several seconds, he said, "No, Tomlinson, I'd rather you did
nothing. You would probably do more harm than good. I'll get Biglands
and Moulton on to the job." Having come to this decision he made it
clear that he had no further use for me, or interest in me. Our
conversation fell dead between us. I remember feeling that the real
Victor had simply disappeared, and that the creature in front of me was
a sort of animated husk with no real inner life of its own. It was as
though one had reached out to grasp the hand of a friend, and had
grasped nothing but air. With a vague shame and guilt, which I
irrationally felt on my own account, I left him.</p>

<p>The Cadogan-Smith Incident caused a flare-up of the inveterate "town
and gown" feeling in the local press. Editors demanded that an example
should be made of this turbulent undergraduate. Let him stand his trial
with his accomplices and serve full sentence. But presently the tone of
the press began to change. It was said that C.-S. turned out to be a
decent young man who was mentally rather unbalanced and had had some
sort of mental storm through over-working. In this condition he had
been led astray by evil company. Severe punishment would probably turn
him permanently toward anti-social behaviour. Let him finish his
university career. Give him a chance to turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p>We had all supposed that C.-S. would at the very least be sent down
from the university, but to our surprise he suddenly appeared once more
in residence, and was merely gated for the rest of the term.</p>

<p>I made several efforts to open up friendly relations with Victor
again, but he resolutely rebuffed me. He had become once more the young
"blood" who had invaded my room at the beginning of the previous term.
We were in our last year, and by the end of our university career we
were practically strangers.</p>

<p>Reading over this chapter, I feel that I have presented only one
side of Victor's character as he was during our undergraduate days. I
have been so concerned with what may be called his supernormal powers
that I have failed to show him as a real human being with
idiosyncrasies and weaknesses like the rest of us. He was no superman,
and no saint. Much in him seemed to be even a sheer reaction against
the conventional virtues of his own other self. For instance, the
somnolent Victor had always scorned sweets as inappropriate to the
mature men that undergraduates took themselves to be. But the awake
Victor made a point of being rather a pig about sweets. Indeed, on one
occasion he made himself sick by eating a large box of fudge at a
sitting. I was righteously indignant; but he, wiping his greenish face
and blowing his nose after this disgraceful incident, remarked with a
wan smile, "Harry, you're just an unimaginative prig. I despise you.
Damn it, it was worth it, if only to discover one's limitations. Some
day I shall do it again."</p>

<p>The somnolent Victor was a very methodical and tidy creature; but
the awake Victor seemed incapable of keeping his possessions in their
right places. He was apt to drop things where he had last used them.
His rooms in college soon lost their former neatness, and became a
chaos of books, papers, clothes, cakes, sweets, pipes and all sorts of
queer oddities which he had picked up on our country walks. He had
become something of a jackdaw with an irrational itch to collect
attractive trifles. There were about a dozen large pieces of flint,
some of which he had laboriously chipped into arrow-heads, celts and
"leaf-blade" knives. Once, when he had bashed his own thumb by mistake,
he said, "This is the way to learn respect for our paleolithic
ancestors. Not for nothing did they have brains rather bigger than
ours." I noticed, by the way, that though his first efforts would
certainly have been a disgrace to the prehistoric craftsmen, he learned
rapidly, and in the end produced several presentable celts and one
really beautiful little translucent arrow- head, like an accurately cut
jewel. Of this he was unashamedly proud, carrying it about in his
pocket, and showing it to everyone likely to admire it. This exquisite
little object became one of his most treasured "toys". For Victor had a
thoroughly childish craving to finger small articles which he
invariably carried in his pocket for this purpose. In conversation, and
even during serious writing or reading, he would absent-mindedly play
with his arrow-head, or with one of the pebbles, acorns, crystals, and
so on, that had taken his fancy on our walks. Amongst his most valued
treasures were two heavy silver Ptolemaic Egyptian coins that he had
bought in an old junk shop. While talking, he would finger one of these
amply moulded pieces, or gaze intently at the detail of the profile or
coiffure. Yet his attention never seemed to wander from the subject of
conversation. In his rooms, all sorts of objects generally lay about on
table, desk, couch and chairs. Along with notebooks and works on
history and philosophy, were tobacco-pipes, queer old books of prints,
two small granite boulders (one grey and one pink), a number of bits of
wood that showed an attractive grain, a seventeenth-century silver
spoon, a fallow deer's antler (acquired from the Magdalen herd), and a
number of unframed pictures of young women who appealed to his rather
queer taste in feminine beauty.</p>

<p>Strangely, he never seemed to have any difficulty in finding what he
wanted in this chaos. He could always go straight to the desired object
with the precision of a monkey finding its way among the chaos of
branches in the jungle.</p>

<p>Another queer and often exasperating trait was this. In spite of his
remarkably coherent, integrated behaviour in all important matters, his
extravagantly keen zest in the life of the senses often led him to
sacrifice a seemingly major end to a seemingly trivial sensuous
experience. He would become so enthralled with a particularly good brew
of cider (not a popular drink in those days) that he would keep me
waiting for half an hour while he savoured every sip, with all the
seriousness of an expert wine-taster. Often our planned walk was
completely upset while he strayed about watching the flight of gulls or
swallows, or the hovering of a kestrel. Once, when this had led to our
missing a train and an important Union debate, I protested rather
violently. He rounded on me with scorn, declaring that if only I had
used my eyes and my wits properly I should have got far more out of
those birds than a "gas-bag politician" could ever give.</p>

<p>Victor seemed to have a special feeling about birds, a combination
of primitive lust in the chase, scientific and aesthetic interest, and
something else, difficult to define, but in a way almost religious.
When an unfamiliar bird appeared, he would throw all his plans to the
winds to stalk and watch it. He made a careful study of bird-flight,
particularly in the case of gulls, swallows, hawks and other expert
fliers. He would often spend hours experimenting with little home-made
gliders, made of paper for indoor work, and of wood and oiled silk for
the windy crests of ridges. He was fascinated by the admirably
functional shapes of the master fliers among birds. Evolution, he used
to say, had moulded them to fit beautifully into the air-streams that
their speed created. He was fascinated not only by their perfection of
form and action in the air but also by their temperament, their
attitude to life. "Man", he once said, "concentrated on intelligence,
birds on artistry. And in a way all their art is sacred art." When I
protested, he laughed, and said, "Watch a gull cruising around. No
doubt he's in search of food, spying after titbits, but that is not
all. How he lives in the sheer skill of flight, like a skater! His
cruising is flight become a religious exercise, an ecstatic harmony
with the universe, only possible to creatures that have I perfected
their adaptation to the environment; quite impossible for man, that
half-made clumsy flutterer in a more difficult medium." I broke in with
the remark that a gull's cruising was no more religious than a woman's
cruising for bargains in a general store. He laughed again, and pointed
out that the gull had been fashioned by millions of years of life in
the air, and the woman had not been fashioned by general stores, or not
to the same extent. He said, "On a fine day, and with a reasonably full
belly, the gull's cruising is a sheer act of worship. Can't you feel
into it enough to recognize that? And think of all the rest of the pure
artistry of birds. Think of courtship, nest-building, and song. No
doubt the robin's song begins as sheer sexiness or sheer defiance to
his neighbours; but the immediate end is soon overlaid with pure
artistry, and worship. If you took more notice of birds, you old
stick-in-the-mud, you might be able to get inside them a bit and feel
how they feel."</p>

<p>Another consequence of Victor's addiction for "living in the moment"
was one which, in spite of my vaunted emancipation from the
conventions, I regarded as reprehensible. Whenever he saw a girl that
strongly attracted him, he used to watch her with frank delight, and if
possible find some way of striking up a casual conversation with her.
Such conduct might pass unnoticed today, but when we were
undergraduates, before the First World War, it looked bad. Besides, it
was annoying to me because it often upset our plans. My expostulation
seldom availed to bring him to his senses. Nearly always he scornfully
insisted that it was sheer folly not to gather rosebuds while one
might. It must be admitted that these casual encounters were very
different from the minor flirtations of other young men. I cannot think
of a better way of describing Victor's technique than by saying that,
in spite of his unconcealed admiration, he seemed rather to aim at
establishing a comradely relation than to invite dalliance. If the girl
reacted by putting up a veil of virgin modesty or, on the other hand,
by "leading him on", he would promptly turn away. He once told me that
he supposed what he really wanted of these brief encounters was to "add
to the picture-gallery of his memory", so that by contemplating these
treasures he might improve his sensitivity both to physical beauty and
to the beauty of personality. I remarked that his taste was very
different from mine, and that he seemed to fall for very queer-looking
girls. He replied with spirit, "Damn it, man, it's time you outgrew the
mere chocolate-box lovelies. They are too easy to appreciate. The
really enthralling girls are rare. That's why I have to pursue them a
bit, lest I should miss a treasure." In passing, perhaps I should
remind the reader that though the awake Victor had a rather odd taste
in feminine beauty, the somnolent Victor's taste was strictly orthodox.
Hence Edith. I sometimes felt that Victor's interest in strange girls
was a special case of his lively zoological interest. All through his
life Victor retained what I used to regard as a childish interest in
birds and all animals. Once he dragged me up to London to visit the
Zoo. I was soon as tired as a middle-aged uncle piloting a vigorous
young nephew around. Or rather Victor did the piloting, and I trailed
after him. I was really more interested in Victor's reactions than in
the beasts. Some cages he passed after half a minute's careful study,
but others enthralled him. He would stand perfectly still with an
expression in which scientific scrutiny, schoolboy delight and
sorrowful insight succeeded each other like moments of sunshine and
shade. In those days the "newest type of zoo" had not yet been adopted
in England. The creatures were kept in much more wretched conditions
than is now customary. They were all quite obviously bored prisoners,
and their despond affected Victor deeply. After a while, to my
embarrassment, he took to talking to the beasts, as a completely
unselfconscious child might do. But what he said was not childish.
Speaking quietly, and as to an equal, he would express diffident
compassion, apologizing for the unimaginative and ruthless conduct of
his own species toward other species. Onlookers sniggered at him; but
he turned to them with his wry smile that was half comic, half tragic,
and said, "Well, it's true, isn't it?" The onlookers ceased to snigger.
We came to a polar bear that was pacing ceaselessly behind its bars,
ignoring the spectators. As it turned at the end of its cage, it rubbed
its shoulders against the partition. This endlessly repeated action had
resulted in a patch of bare skin on each shoulder. Victor watched in
silence for some time; then he said, "You poor devil! It's a change
from the Arctic! You're cut out for ice and snow hunting, and look what
we do to you." Surprisingly, the bear came to a halt and faced him. It
sniffed at him through the bars and gave a rumbling whimper, for all
the world as though in some obscure way it recognized a friend.</p>

<p>I mention this incident because it gave me a little shock at the
time, and because it fell in line with a number of other queer
encounters between Victor and dumb animals. The strange thing was that
they often seemed to notice him and like him even when he was not
attending to them. I have no plausible explanation to offer, but it is
a fact that animals took to Victor. Dogs, for instance, had a habit of
attaching themselves to him for companionship on a walk. Several times
when we sat down to rest in a field a dog arrived and settled itself
against him for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>Once, when we were sitting talking in a field near a village, an
obviously verminous tike accosted him in this way and he gently threw
it off; but it kept on returning. "Go!" he cried, "Hop it! Va t'en!
Imshi!" He made fierce noises at it, and pretended to throw a stone,
but it merely wagged its tail. Then it calmly sat down against him and
began catching fleas. Victor jumped to his feet and said very firmly,
"Look here, brother! You have fleas and I haven't, so kindly keep off."
The animal put its head on one side and looked at him in a puzzled
genial way, again vaguely wagging its tail. Victor dropped on one knee,
took its head between his hands, looked into its eyes, and said very
solemnly. "I know we're friends. I know mutual understanding binds us
eternally as comrades. I know you're horribly misunderstood at home and
you still retain a glorious faith in humanity in spite of everything.
But for reasons not apparent to you I suggest we love one another at a
distance." He then gently pushed the creature away and sat down again
beside me. The dog hesitated for a moment, then squatted where it was,
looking reproachfully at Victor. Presently it turned its attention once
more to its fleas. When we continued our walk, it came with us for some
distance, but after a while it wandered off on its own.</p>

<p>I once asked Victor why dogs liked him. "God knows!" he said.
"Perhaps I smell right."</p>

<p>Children also seemed to take a fancy to him. He never made advances
to them, but when they opened up relations with him, he responded in
his detached though friendly man-to-man way, and was at once taken into
partnership. He had little experience of children, but he seemed to
enter imaginatively into any child's point of view. When he was drawn
into a child's play, he behaved sometimes, of course, with humour and
mischief, but often with great seriousness, as though the game were
quite as important to him as to the child. For example, once we entered
a crowded London train, and a compartment in which a tired and
disheartened mother was trying to cope with a tired and cantankerous
little boy. It so happened that I sat next the woman, and Victor
opposite. We buried ourselves in our books. The ceaseless complaining
kept up by the child made it impossible for me to concentrate, but
Victor was soon wholly absorbed in his History of Socialism. The child
fidgeted and whined and yelled. Presently it fell silent, gazing at
Victor. Though I was next it, it took no notice of me. It leaned
forward from its mother's lap and banged Victor's knee. He looked up,
smiled, and continued reading. It grabbed at the pages; he gently
removed its fingers. The mother scolded the unruly infant, but it
continued to take an interest in the mysteriously attractive young man
sitting opposite. When other methods of approach had failed, the little
boy took the chocolate out of his own mouth and offered it to Victor.
The spectators laughed, but Victor said politely, "It's awfully good of
you but I'd rather you had it." Meanwhile he had closed his book, and
after fumbling in a pocket he produced (of all unlikely things) the
curb-chain of a horse's bridle. This treasure he had acquired a few
days earlier at a village saddler's. We had been passing through the
village, and he was attracted by the window full of harness,
curry-combs and horse-cloths. He insisted on entering the shop in
search of a new treasure, and presently he hit on the chain. Evidently
it had been in his pocket ever since. He now laid the six inches of
shining metal neatly on his knee, remarking, "Nice, isn't it?" Then he
picked it up and twisted it into a tight spiral, then shook it out into
its normal looseness and handed it to the child, who took it and
examined it with solemn eyes. Victor returned to his reading. But
presently the child, still holding the chain, reached forward with both
arms toward Victor, and said "Dadad ", to everyone's amusement. Victor
closed his book with a sigh and received the infant. For half an hour
he entertained his new friend with the contents of his pockets, telling
him a simple story about each article, and obviously enjoying
himself.</p>

<p>I record these little incidents because they throw light on Victor's
character as a young man. But indeed throughout his life incidents of
this sort were apt to occur to the awake Victor. And even when he was
nearly sixty he still combined with his exceptionally adult nature many
childlike, or positively childish, traits. The toy habit remained with
him. Dogs and even horses continued to follow him about. And throughout
my acquaintance with him he was apt to allow immediate sensory
pleasures to upset relatively serious enterprises, and to be completely
unashamed of doing so. He once said, "No doubt man triumphed by taking
thought for the morrow, and he must learn to take thought even for a
very distant morrow, thousands of years ahead; but sometimes the
present's claim is more urgent than the future's. And if you never live
in the present moment, never let it soak right through you at every
pore, you never really live at all."</p>

<h2>4 - BUSINESS MAN AND SOLDIER</h2>

<h4>From 1912 to 1919</h4>

<p>I HAVE TOLD about the beginning of my friendship with Victor as it
appeared from my point of view. On his wedding day, while we were on
our walk, he went over those already remote events, describing his own
side of the experience. And so the whole affair took on a new meaning
for me. His occasional lapses into unfriendliness, and his final
complete withdrawal, all of which had at the time seemed such
gratuitous and wilful violations of a valued relationship, now appeared
in a new light. Victor had not betrayed our friendship. He had simply
ceased to exist. The Victor that I knew had been spirited away. I could
no more blame him than I could blame an unconscious man.</p>

<p>This discovery that Victor had not been himself, and so had not
betrayed our friendship, had a surprisingly deep effect on me.
Evidently I had never quite realized how much the friendship had meant
to me, and how its breakdown had disturbed the foundations of my mind.
Now that the explanation had been given, I felt a rather extravagant
elation, which I was at pains to conceal. Somehow the whole universe
took on a different aspect. Friends might die, or might helplessly
suffer a psychological change; but friendship remained, after all, a
reliable thing.</p>

<p>After we left Oxford I saw nothing of Victor for some years; but I
had occasional letters from him, written (I now learned) during periods
in which the more lucid personality held the field. He passed into the
shipping firm where his father had a certain influence. I, lacking his
opportunities, took a post as English master in a secondary school. We
were stationed in different parts of the country, and our paths never
met. My report of the next phase of his life therefore depends entirely
on his own account, given to me on his wedding day.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual happened during his first year as a businessman.
Like so many young university men flung into office life, he found the
routine very irksome, and was much more interested in his leisure
occupations than in his work. He became a typical young provincial
man-about-town, of the lazier and more genteel sort. He was made a
member of one of the leading clubs. He danced. He was thoroughly spoilt
by the daughters of the business community on account of his good looks
and a certain lordly carelessness in his attitude to them. He took them
out in his sports car, always returning them safely at night. He played
a good deal of tennis, and was a brilliant three- quarter in the first
fifteen of the best local rugger club.</p>

<p>On several occasions he was probably on the verge of waking to his
true self, for he had strange bouts of restlessness, in which the great
shipping firm became a clear and rather exciting whole in his mind. In
these spells he would stay late at the office, reading up old
correspondence files, studying the plans of ships, puzzling over
problems of naval architecture, examining the ledgers, and the accounts
of individual voyages, particularly those which showed a loss, and were
dramatically recorded in red ink. But his chief interest, during these
spells of semi-lucidity, was in the working conditions of crews,
dockers and other employees. He would take every possible opportunity
of being present when one of the directors interviewed a ship's captain
at the beginning or end of a voyage. On one occasion he got himself
assigned to work in connection with the actual loading of ships in
dock; and ten days later, when the mood had passed, he cursed his
folly; for when the interest had wained, the practical upshot was
simply that he had removed himself further from the centres of his
pleasure.</p>

<p>The difference between his brighter moods and his normal apathetic
condition was distinct enough to attract the attention of his
superiors, particularly on one occasion. While he was doing a spell of
work in the naval architect's department, he hit upon a bright idea for
a new form of rudder. At first the professionals treated it lightly, as
the extravagance of a bright young man. But in spite of themselves they
kept on discussing it; and finally, after a great deal of calculation
and draftmanship had been devoted to it, the finished design was
adopted by the firm as the standard rudder of all their ships. But,
long before this happened, its inventor had slipped back into his
normal phase. During the preliminary stages of the detailed
consideration of the rudder he had been intensely interested, and
fertile in suggestions. But suddenly he seemed to lose both interest
and ability. He was unable to make any useful contribution, and indeed
could scarcely conceal the fact that he could not properly understand
the point of his own brilliant idea. So marked was the difference
between his former brightness and his subsequent dullness, that those
who had not actually seen him at work in the creative period were
inclined to believe that young Cadogan-Smith had simply stolen his
great invention from someone else. But those who had worked with him,
and remembered his leaping imagination, rejected this theory. Victor
himself now ceased to take any spontaneous interest in his achievement,
save as a means of acquiring credit in the eyes of his superiors.</p>

<p>In his "half-awake" state Victor seems to have been not only rather
more interested and rather more intelligent than in his normal state;
he was also rather more aware of others as persons. Hence his concern
for the living conditions of the employees. He went so far as to
agitate discreetly for improvements in the crew-accommodation in the
fo'castles of the company's ships. He even suggested an innovation
which in those days seemed quite fantastic, namely that each member of
the crew should have a single-berth cabin. Victor's criticism of
existing accommodation somewhat outraged the directors, as they prided
themselves on being in the forefront in respect of amenities for crews,
and the suggestion that they should raise the standard of comfort even
further seemed to them "sheer idealism ".</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said the head of the firm, "if we were to carry out
your plans, we should soon fail to pay dividends. After all, the
company is not a charitable institution. And anyhow, surely you must
realize that the class of man who goes to sea as a deck-hand or stoker
simply doesn't need the sort of thing you want to give him. And he
wouldn't know how to use it properly. Everything would go to rack and
ruin in no time." As soon as Victor saw that his philanthropy was
damaging his reputation with his superiors, he dropped the subject.
This surrender was not entirely due to cynical self-regard. He was
genuinely persuaded that his ideas were Utopian, and that if he wanted
to be a successful business man, he must outgrow that sort of
thing.</p>

<p>On one occasion only, during his early business career, did Victor
pass beyond his "half-awake" state and attain full clarity of
consciousness. Having served some time in each of the departments of
the great office, he had been appointed secretary to the directors. In
this position he would gain some experience of the general policy of
the firm; and in due course he himself, if all went well, might become
a junior director.</p>

<p>One day he was present at a discussion on pilfering at the docks.
The firm had employed detectives to bring the culprits to book, but
without results. Victor was at the time in his "partially awake"
condition. He had evidently shown some intelligence in the discussion,
for his suggestion that he himself should do a bit of detective work at
the docks was accepted.</p>

<p>I had better describe this incident as nearly as possible in
Victor's own words, as he recounted the adventure to me while we were
returning from our walk on his wedding day.</p>

<p>"In my half-awake state," he said, "I was rather more sensitive to
people's minds than in my normal somnolent state. I was able to make
use of this power in a number of ways in the service of the firm. I
don't think telepathy played a part. I was just more sensitive to
people's reactions. I seemed to read in their faces and their gestures
and tones of voice what they were feeling. Another thing that probably
helped me in my adventure was my experience with the lads in the
factory at Oxford. Mind you, I couldn't remember about that, because it
belonged to my fully awake phase; but automatically I seemed to behave
ill the right way to make contact with working people. I intuitively
put on the right mental disguise. I was able to pose effectively to the
dockers as a bloke who had seen rather better days, and was now forced
to take to dock-labouring for a living. I was the helpless and amiable
novice who had to be initiated into every side of the dockers' life,
and I gradually got myself accepted as 'one of us.'</p>

<p>"I was supposed to be completely reliable, and of course I made a
point of persuading everyone that I was entirely on the side of the
workers against the employers. On this subject I took a high moral
line, which increased my reputation. Presently I discovered that there
was an organized system of pilfering and selling the swag for the
benefit of certain down-and-out families. The gang had a very strict
moral code of its own, a rigid 'honour among thieves'. If anyone in the
gang was known to be pilfering for his own private use, failing to
deliver the proceeds for the common purpose, he suffered for it. One
man, who was believed to be a spy in the pay of the detectives, was got
rid of by an ingeniously staged fatal accident. He was cleverly induced
to pitch himself head first into an empty hold, seemingly through sheer
carelessness. This incident made me a bit anxious lest 1 should
eventually share his fate. So 1 made up my mind to retire to my own
world on the following day. But something happened that upset my plans.
1 woke. Suddenly, as 1 was coaxing a swinging case of machinery into
the right position for stowing (1 believe it was at the very moment
when my docker's hook gripped the wood) I saw the whole wretched affair
as it really was. 1 saw myself as a supporter of an economic tyranny
spying on a group of people who, whatever their faults, felt themselves
to be under no obligation towards their masters, and were stealing for
a very laudable purpose, namely to succour the distressed. I saw that,
though in a just society the pilfering would have been inexcusable, in
our unjust society one ought at any rate, to approve of the courage and
comradeship and self- dedication in a generous cause. Of course one
couldn't approve of the murder, but one really couldn't take a high
moral line about it. Now 1 was faced with a very unpleasant problem. 1
had the necessary information for convicting the gang not only of
pilfering but of murder. This information must be kept from the
authorities. So long as 1 remained fully awake, it was safe. But 1
might go somnolent again at any time, and then 1 should certainly
blab.</p>

<p>"I went on working in the hold, with a mate who was also in the
gang. He was a hearty lad who kept up a patter of mildly obscene
humour. He had an angel's smile, and red hair on his bare arms. Looking
at him, 1 saw quite clearly that I must be loyal to him and his mates
at all costs. But how save the situation? 1 racked my brains for a
plan. Should I write a note to the office saying that 1 felt 1 was
going mad, and any stories 1 might tell would be pure fabrication? Too
feeble! Should I give myself up to the gang and let them dispose of me?
Not fair to saddle them with another crime. And quite unnecessary. For
gradually it dawned on me that the only way to save the gang was to
dispose of myself. At first this, seemed a silly quixotic thing to do.
But the more I thought about it, sweating with the labour of shifting
those packing cases, the more important it seemed to save the gang: and
the less important to keep my own life; such a scrappy, ineffective
life as it was."</p>

<p>At this point of Victor's narrative I interrupted to say that his
resolve to kill himself seemed to me quite fantastic. He was silent for
a few seconds, and then replied, "I had another motive also, an obscure
sense that in sacrificing myself I should be performing a symbolic act,
sacrificing one of the exploiters (my baser self) for the welfare of
the people." To this I snorted something about sheer sentimentality;
but Victor said only, "Oh, well, that is how it struck me."</p>

<p>Presently he continued his story. "How I remember slogging away in
that hold, with the fine feeling of muscles skilfully used; and
gradually facing up to the fact that I must kill myself! While I was
working I got the hell of a bump from one of the swinging cases, and in
my awake state it hurt extravagantly. And yet deeper down I was merely
smiling at it. In the same way, the prospect of death hurt like hell,
and yet I was also contemptuously laughing at it. I did so want to
live. Everything was so vivid and difficult and beautiful, from my
mate's heavenly grin to the smooth steel of my hook. And yet--what
matter? If I didn't have it, other 'I's would have it. So long as it
was had, what matter? I hung on to that thought, like a drowning man to
his straw; till at last I began to feel that in some queer way the 'I'
that was now choosing death was identical with all the other 'I's'; and
therefore would in some sense not die at all. And yet I was convinced
that in some other, simpler, sense I should cease to exist.</p>

<p>"Well, as we were leaving the ship for the dinner hour, I looked
round for something heavy, and found a large iron pulley, for one of
the derricks. When I thought no one was looking, I picked this up and
began to tie it round my neck with a bit of line. Unfortunately a
stevedore had been watching my strange antics, and when he saw what I
was up to he came at me. I had to hurry with the tying, and didn't get
it done properly before I had to go overboard or be caught. I went
over, hugging the thing; but presumably when I lost consciousness I let
it go, and the pulley dragged itself free. Anyhow, they got me out and
brought me round with artificial respiration. I woke in the somnolent
state; and very confused, because, of course, I couldn't remember what
had happened in the awake state. But I did remember all that had
occurred before I woke. I had enough evidence to convict a bunch of men
of theft and one or two of murder."</p>

<p>"Naturally my attempt at suicide caused a stir, and had somehow to
be explained. Of course, I gave my true name, and accounted for my
disguise. I made my report to my future father-in-law, who came to see
me at the hospital. I said that spying had got on my nerves and given
me an irrational sense of guilt to such an extent that I daren't face
the world any more. This was certainly a good line. Everyone was full
of sympathy and admiration, and I acted up to the part very thoroughly.
In due season ten men were accused. At the trial, I gave my evidence
with seeming reluctance and distress, and I pleaded for mercy. But at
heart I didn't feel any distress at all. I simply felt I had done
rather a good piece of work, and the men must take the consequences of
their anti-social behaviour. All received heavy sentences. The two who
had brought off the murder were hanged, poor devils. Or lucky devils.
May be they really fared better than the others."</p>

<p>By the time that Victor had finished this story, we had almost
completed our circuit in the country, and were hurrying to catch the
last bus back to our hotel. In the bus he mentioned that after this
incident he had formed much more steady business habits, even though he
was in his normal somnolent state. Whether this change was due to some
slight infection from his suppressed personality or to a natural bent
for business, I do not know. Certainly it is fairly common for young
men flung from the university into business to go through a phase of
restlessness before finally accepting the routine of office work. But
the single-mindedness with which he devoted himself to his business
career was remarkable. He was determined, at all costs, to "make good".
The firm was so pleased with his new keenness and shrewdness that they
planned to give him managerial status, sooner than had been
intended.</p>

<p>But in 1914, when war was declared, Victor at once began to feel
restless. (It was while we were sitting at dinner in our hotel after
the abortive wedding that Victor told me about his war experiences.)
All the most reputable young men were soon flocking to the colours. And
the normal Victor was very susceptible to public opinion. After a few
months of restlessness, during which the firm did its best to retain
him, he enlisted, and became an infantry officer. When he had told me
this, Victor lapsed into one of his silences, so I had to prompt him
again. I knew that he had been at one time in disgrace, but I did not
know why. I also knew that he had redeemed his character, and ended in
some fairly important staff job. At first he seemed reluctant to talk,
and I assumed that he did not want to tell me about his disgrace. When
I deliberately made it easy for him to divert the whole conversation,
he looked at me sharply, and said, "You think I'm ashamed of being
court-martialled. (The first time it was for cowardice, the second for
insubordination.) No! It's something else that I find distasteful.
However, here goes!"</p>

<p>He told me that "the somnolent cad" quickly made himself known for
intelligence and dash; and that, as he combined these qualities with
great docility toward his superiors, he soon began climbing the ladder
of promotion. But on two occasions the true Victor woke into being, and
nearly wrecked the laboriously built-up reputation of the
somnambulist.</p>

<p>"When it first happened," he said, "I was still a subaltern. There
was to be an attack. Throughout the preparations, when everyone was
anxiously concealing his fear and loathing of the whole bloody
prospect, I was--well, 'magnificent' is the inevitable word. I put
heart into the platoon, and into my brother officers. I was full of
exultation and eagerness for the coming battle. Of real fear I felt
practically nothing, for I was hypnotized by the idea that I was going
to behave splendidly and cover myself with glory. The whole affair was
just an opportunity for self-display. My imagination was too sluggish
to realize anything but the romantic aspect. I had to pretend to feel
some anxiety (pretend even to myself, I mean), so that I could triumph
over it with a brave face. But I really felt no more than the stage-
fright that a schoolboy feels before going out to bat for the school.
Well, zero hour came, and I led my lads over the top with my customary
dash. Several of the poor devils dropped. One showed signs of turning
tail, so I promptly shot him. Soon we were using bayonets in the
enemy's first-line trench, and soon our position was secure."</p>

<p>Victor was silent for a moment, and began eating faster, as though
trying to release some pent-up energy. Presently he said, "Then it
happened. I don't know what actually caused the waking, perhaps the
appealing look on the face of a dying German, like a mouse in a trap.
But that was nothing new. Perhaps the real cause was that the Boche's
face was a bit like yours. I remember noticing that. Or perhaps it was
just that when the scrap was over I had time to feel that I had a
splinter under my thumbnail. Anyhow, I, the real I, suddenly came on
the scene, and found that everything was silly and horrible, and very
terrifying. Shells were falling unpleasantly near; and now, of course,
I could imagine quite well what might happen. If I had been fully
awake, I could have faced it; but I wasn't. I was just abnormally
sensitive, but not properly integrated, I suppose. And so I was
frightened clean out of my wits. No, not out of my wits, for I didn't
rush about screaming. I just waited in a cold sweat for the next move
in the preposterous game. The folly of people driving themselves to
face all this just to capture a bloody ditch made me terrified of my
own kind, and of myself. The whole war, which I had never really
thought about, but only talked about parrot-wise, suddenly appeared as
a huge and diabolical booby-trap. All the high-sounding phrases that I
thought I believed seemed now sheer mockery. 'A War to end War!'
'Making the world safe for democracy!' Christ! It suddenly became clear
to me, as of course it had done to many others, that killing people
just wasn't the way to make a decent world. It suddenly appeared to me
that every human life was absolutely sacred and must never be
destroyed. And I remembered the lad I had shot for hesitating. You see,
I wasn't fully awake, just tormented by quickened sensitivity. My
thumb, for instance, was hurting like a violent toothache. And I had no
comprehensive vision that could put my pain in proper perspective,
still less put the war in perspective. And I had no self-detachment. I
just stood there fidgeting; torn between the impulse to bury my face in
my hands and blub, and the impulse to jump on the parapet and shout
'God is Love'. Then came an order to advance, and I think I did scream
out 'God is Love', and then I collapsed in a whimpering heap in the
mud. The lads went over all right, and left me. They probably thought I
had been hit. Well, that was what I was court- martialled for. Long
before the time of the trial, of course, I was my normal somnolent
self, and quite ignorant of the events of the awake spell. I was let
off lightly, on the strength of my previous record, and the obvious
fact that I was a bit crazy. But it dished my precious career for some
time. I was sent home for a rest-cure, and supervision by the
psychiatrists. They were not very clever in those days, and I managed
to conceal the fact that I had always been subject to spells of
dissociation of some sort. They just treated me for 'shell shock', and
gave me a good holiday. Of course I (or the somnolent ass who
masqueraded as me) was terribly upset at the damage done to my career,
and impatient to start again, and anxious lest another slip should once
more bring me to the bottom of the ladder. No! I must be fair to the
fool. He had been badly wounded in his self-respect, and he had
betrayed his soldierly ideal, and guilt gnawed at him. He didn't really
know that he cared far more for his own career than for a victory for
the Allies."</p>

<p>Victor paused; then, stabbing at his potatoes with his fork, he said
bitterly, "Fancy being tied for life to an insensitive snob! It's like
being a Siamese twin, and the other partner a half-wit."</p>

<p>I began to commiserate; but to my surprise he brushed my sympathy
aside, and said, "Have you noticed the girl who is serving us?" I had
not; and I was surprised that he had been able to do so while he was
absorbed in telling me about events that were obviously still very much
on his mind. But I remembered that one of the most striking
characteristics of the awakened Victor was his power of attending to
two things at once.</p>

<p>He said, "I have been watching her ever since we came in. And this
morning at breakfast, when I was the Dolt, I couldn't keep my eyes off
her. I thought her the ugliest thing I had ever seen, and thanked my
lucky stars for Edith. But now--god, she's lovely! I wonder whether
seeing her had something to do with waking me. Look at her! Look at
her!"</p>

<p>I could see the girl in the big mirror on the opposite wall. She was
serving the sweet at the table behind me. She was a well-built wench,
certainly, but there was a juvenile or country clumsiness about her
action, and her shape was somehow rather unfinished, rather like a
statue in the rough, that still needed a lot of trimming. And as to her
face I should have advised the sculptor to begin again on fresh stone.
The eyes were very wide apart, and of a curious dark grey, the colour
of tarns overhung by rocks; but with flecks of russet in the grey, like
the ruddy weathering one sometimes sees on grey slate or shale. The
eyes were indeed quite good eyes. Remembering them afterwards, I had to
admit that they were striking eyes, large and intelligent, serious, but
rippled over with laughter when a small boy, whom she was serving,
carefully selected the biggest jam tart. Strange eyes, certainly, with
lashes and eyebrows of an unusual red-brown, as though they were
originally black, but had gone rusty. The hair, too, was rust-red, but
bright, heavy, and voluminous. It threatened to collapse on the large
shoulders at any moment. But the nose! The sculptor must have broken
the first nose and tried to do something with the stump. It was broad
and flat, merely a place where a large nose might have been. The mouth
was fantastically wide and full. The sculptor had evidently been
frightened of having another accident, so he had left a great deal of
spare rock to play about with. The complexion was surprisingly good.
The rock's texture was silky and even. The sculptor could not spoil the
actual material, save by misshaping it. Nor could he extinguish the
warm glow that seemed to come from some inner fire. Suddenly I realized
that the girl was blushing.</p>

<p>I looked at Victor. He was gazing at her with a frank grin of
admiration, most out-of-place in the circumstances. "She reminds me of
a hippopotamus," I said. "Me too," he answered gaily, "a lovely
blushing hippo!" He added more seriously, "The tragic thing is that a
human face may perfectly express a lovely soul, and yet have no soul at
all behind it. Has she a soul, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Maybe she has," I answered, "but if so, the tragic thing is that
it's not able to express itself through a face like that."</p>

<p>"Good God, man," he protested, "have you no eyes, no eyes?
Insensitive blockhead!" He was laughing, but genuinely outraged.</p>

<p>He suddenly changed the subject. "I must tell you of the other
waking I had during the war. I was in command of a I company, and we
had been left in a tight place during an unexpected German attack. Our
instructions were to hang on I at all costs. My somnolent self gloried
in the situation, at first, and behaved with his customary rectitude.
We were very heavily shelled, and had a lot of casualties. Presently
the Boches came at us from their trench, and in our reduced state we
hadn't an earthly." Victor paused, thinking. Suddenly he said, "Oh,
hell! What do the details matter! The point is that the survivors, en
masse, gave up resisting, and made off down a communication trench. My
morale then broke too, and I followed them, helter-skelter. Suddenly I
woke; more thoroughly than on the previous occasion. As before, there
was the increased vividness of sensation, but also something else,
which I can only describe as an increased grasp of the total situation,
both military and-well, cosmological. When I woke, I was already mixed
up with the others again, stampeding; and the surprise of waking was so
startling that I came to a standstill and laughed, crouching in that
trench. I was terrifically conscious of my body, and of the strained
faces of the lads staggering past me. But also, I was aware of all this
as one might be aware of animalcules on a brilliantly illuminated
microscope slide. I felt a sort of lofty pity for us all, but I was
utterly remote and detached; because I was also at the very same time
intensely aware of so much more. I saw us as simply the visible bit of
mankind. I knew vividly that just round the corner, so to speak, there
were all the armies, all the peoples, all the historical ages of man's
floundering struggle; and enclosing the whole thing, black heaven,
pointed with stars. This happened in a flash, and was mixed up with
thoughts of Socrates and Jesus Christ and the problem of good and
evil.</p>

<p>"Of course it's nonsense to talk about all this happening 'in a
flash'. But something happened in that flash, something that I cannot
describe in any other way. Well, suddenly it was borne in on me that
this business of running away to save my skin was somehow a surrender
of my spiritual freedom, in fact a sorry act of self-destruction on the
part of-well-not simply on the part of me, Victor, in this skin, but of
humanity in all its skins, or (better) the very spirit in us all. How
that word makes me squirm! But what other is there? Well, something had
to be done to re-assert the universal thing in me, in us all, I mean;
the supreme thing that really matters. I cautiously looked over the
top, and spotted a machine-gun that was enfilading the next lap of the
trench, where most of my men were still struggling along. There was a
chance that I could get at it from the rear without being noticed, if I
crawled round by a line of overlapping shell- holes. It was a very poor
chance, but what matter? Even if I didn't get through, I should have
'asserted the spirit '. So I set about and did that little job, and had
the luck not to be spotted. Note, I didn't do it out of patriotism, or
because I believed that an Allied victory was necessary to humanity.
Nor did I do it out of simple self- pride. I just did it because I had
to do something to assert the integrity of the universal thing in us. I
took the German boys completely by surprise, poor devils, and pitched a
hand-grenade at them. It was a messy business. One of them was still
able to cause trouble when I ran in, but I put a bullet in his face
with my pistol. As I did it, I felt a strong friendliness toward him,
but this didn't make me hesitate, any more than I had hesitated to
chuck away my own life. I did both things just because the something in
me had undertaken a job and must carry it through."</p>

<p>At this point I interrupted Victor to get him to explain more fully
what he meant by the "something" in him. He considered for a while; at
least I suppose he did, but his far-away look seemed to focus on the
ugly waitress, who was serving at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>At last he said, "I can only repeat that something universal in me
protested against my individual cowardice. Or perhaps it was as though
the little ordinary 'I' woke to be the universal 'I' for a few minutes.
I woke to be something more than Victor, even the awakened Victor. Did
I? I wonder!"</p>

<p>Before I could ask him to pursue the explanation, he continued.
"This affair, of course, put me in the limelight. I was recommended for
a Victoria Cross. But I never got it, because of subsequent events. You
see, after that show, I remained awake for some months, carrying on
with my job in a mood of glorious detachment and amusement, much as an
adult may enter into a children's game. For in my prevailing mood at
that time I generally felt as though I were an actor; yes, an actor
playing a part in a children's game, entering into it with immense
zest, but enjoying it mainly out of a nostalgia for my own long-lost
childhood. In fact I was playing at soldiers, keeping the rules
meticulously, but always with secret amusement. I never really cared
which side won, so long as the game itself was interesting."</p>

<p>"But, Victor," I interrupted, "you were not like that when I knew
you. You took sides. You did care which side won. You once said you
were on the side of the light, against darkness."</p>

<p>He laughed, and replied, cryptically, "My dear fellow, there's a
time for protest, and a time for acceptance. But best is to do both at
once, always. But that, believe me, takes some doing. And I had still
to learn it. You'll see."</p>

<p>He paused again, and I urged him to go on with the story. "Well," he
said, "I was an immense success with the children. I played soldiers so
well that they too played better. They had been flagging, poor boys,
because they really had struck a pretty gruelling patch in the game.
But now they were all keyed up again. Somehow I kidded them into
thinking that mud and blood were rather stimulating. I knew they
couldn't stick it indefinitely, but I might keep them up to scratch
till we were relieved. Of course the high-ups were vastly pleased with
me, and I was obviously invaluable to them. But presently I spoilt it
all (from their point of view) by breaking the rules. We had been on a
very tough job, and done it well, and come out of the line to rest,
those of us who were left. And, God, we needed it. Most of us were just
at breaking point, and it was touch and go. Well, the day after we had
come down from the front we happened to be inspected by a brigadier who
was a blockhead. He found the men's rifles dirty, and he raised hell.
Suddenly, I realized that I had done with acceptance, and was all set
for protest. The bloke was quite entitled to take the line he did,
according to the rules of the game, but I had had enough. I just
quietly told him what I thought of him, and what I thought of
brass-hats in general, and the whole bloody war. I was court-
martialled again. But again, because of my record, and because the
brigadier was known to be a cad and fool, I was let off lightly. I was
sent home for a long rest. Of course I never got the cross, which
didn't at all matter to me; but while I was in England I went somnolent
again; and the somnolent me, when he had succeeded in piecing the past
together from what people said, was bitterly mortified."</p>

<p>Victor paused, but before I had said anything he added. "How I
detest that somnolent self of mine! And yet of course that's quite
unjustified. He can't help being like that. And of course, when I think
quietly about him, I don't detest him. I don't even despise him. I'm
just sorry for him, and determined to keep awake as long as I can. I
wonder how long I shall have this time. Somehow I feel more solidly
awake than ever before, more secure. But one can't tell. This may be
the last five minutes."</p>

<p>I said, "Is it at all in your own power to keep awake? You said he
couldn't help being himself. Can you do anything to avoid slipping back
into being him?"</p>

<p>Victor answered, "I really believe I am beginning to learn. But I
shall probably need help." His eyes turned to the waitress. (Did that
look mean anything, I wondered?) He beckoned her over to us, but all he
said was, "We should like our coffee in the lounge, please."</p>

<p>We found two fairly secluded chairs where we could carry on our
conversation. But for a few seconds we sat silent. Victor was looking
at our fellow guests, and I at him; for I was again struck by the
extraordinary change in his appearance since the morning. It seemed to
have affected even his profile; for not only were the eyes now wide
open and alert, the lips seemed at once fuller and firmer.</p>

<p>Presently Victor said, "Does it strike you, Harry, that several of
these people are trying not to wake, and trying all too well?" I turned
to look at the very commonplace crowd, sipping their coffee in little
groups. I said they didn't seem to me to be trying to do anything at
all. But Victor snorted and declared. "They've been trying so long
(some of them), and so hypnotically, that they don't know they're
trying. Look at that bloke lighting his pipe. Watch his action. There!
He has blown out the match with unnecessary vigour. It's his own soul
he blows out every time. But, unlike the match, his soul somehow comes
alight again always, often inconveniently."</p>

<p>The coffee arrived, brought by the same waitress. As she put the
tray on the table, Victor said to her, "Do you try to keep your soul
from waking? I bet you don't." She tried to prim up her hippopotamus
lips, but a smile broke through. Then, with a queer sort of Scotch
accent that I could not identify, she said, "My soul, sir? I haven't
got one. The management doesn't allow them." She left us, and Victor
laughed after her, trying to recall her.</p>

<p>Waiting for him to continue our conversation, I watched his
expression change from merriment to tenderness and deep seriousness.
Presently I said, "I believe you have fallen for that girl." To this he
answered, "Oh, I have, I have; but I was thinking of Edith. She really
has a soul, you know, but she won't give it a chance. And I did my best
to kill it for her. And now, well, I have given her a nasty knock, poor
girl. But perhaps that will shock her into life. God, I wish I could do
something about her. But probably it's best to leave her alone."</p>

<p>"She'll get over it," I said, "but your name will be dirt with the
whole family, and the office too."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and with my father. It has been the hell of a knock
for him. Curious! I care much more for our father than my doltish other
self ever did. Between my father and me there's a gulf, but I can see
him across the gulf fairly clearly. The Dolt, though he's on our
father's side of the gulf, can't really see him at all, can't
appreciate him as he really is; but I can, perhaps better than our
father can appreciate himself." Victor was lighting his pipe, but at
this point he paused, looking intently at the flame of the match that
he had not yet used. It burned right back to his fingers, till the
sudden heat forced him to notice it and blow it out. "Yes," he said,
"the somnolent ass thinks our father is a sentimentalist. And so he is,
in a way, but so much more besides. He's a sentimental imperialist and
a sentimental careerist. But all that is just an addiction that he
cannot properly control, a sort of mental hiccough that he's really
ashamed of, but can't stop. The Dolt thinks he reads our father like a
book. But he doesn't really. He sees him as a 'realist' whose nerve
fails every now and then; for instance when he begins caring for some
wretched 'hard case' of a black man rather than the white man's
colonial government." Victor nodded slowly, as if well satisfied with
his insight into his father. "In a way," he said, "my father's
character contains both the Dolt and me in a single personality. For
instance, of course he's a snob and a thruster, but he knows he is, and
tries quite hard not to be. And even when he does behave snobbishly he
laughs at himself. Yes, and though he generally treats people as pawns
in a game, sometimes he upsets the whole game for the pawn's sake. And
the game, mind you, is not just his own career (though that is
certainly fatally dear to him). No, the game is really History with a
big H, with himself as one of the pawns, zestfully and conscientiously
playing its part in the game; but always with an underlying tenderness
toward his fellow pawns, a tenderness that he sometimes quite
deliberately allows to break all the rules. That is what the Dolt
thinks is mere muddle-headed weakness, but by God it's not. It's
far-seeing wisdom, and it needs courage, for a man like my father, in
his position. I sometimes wonder what my mother was like. Probably like
Edith." He laughed, sourly.</p>

<p>Then at last he lit his pipe, and pulled at it in silence.</p>

<p>After a while I fetched him out of his reverie by remarking again
that the wedding fiasco would make it very difficult for him at the
office. He said, "Oh, I shall not go back to that life, not so long as
I am awake." I asked if he had any plans, No, he had not; but he must
do something that offered scope for "absorbing the world"; and
something that afforded some possibility of action, "some creative
paying back to the world". He said, "I must get to know what people are
like, all sorts of them. Maybe it's Just revulsion from the Dolt, but I
do feel I want to learn a lot from people, ordinary decent people.
Those dockers, for instance, could have taught me a lot, if I had been
awake," He deplored his wasted opportunities, and his ignorance. "I
shall plan," he said, "for a long life. But, of course, it may all be
over before I finish this pipe."</p>

<p>We talked well into the night, and gradually a decision formed
itself in his mind, largely owing to scraps of information that I was
able to give him. After a lot of desultory consideration of many
possible lines of action, he suddenly remarked, "Yes, of course! I see
what to do. When I have cleared up the mess here, I shall cut right
adrift, settle in another town and try to get some kind of adult
educational work. That way, I shall both absorb and create, in a small
way. At first, of course, there'll be very little creating, but it's
clear I must do a great deal of absorbing before I can attempt anything
much in the way of creating."</p>

<p>Lest he should be expecting too much of this work, I suggested that
he might find it irksome to be constantly dealing with uneducated
minds. Journalism, I thought, might afford him more diverse and
stimulating contacts, and might be used as a stepping-stone to a
literary career.</p>

<p>His reply was emphatic. "No, no!" he said. "Reporting murders and
football matches, and occasionally having an article accepted by a
literary weekly, would not satisfy me at all. I need a solid foundation
of understanding of the lives of ordinary people, preferably working
people. I want to work with minds that have not already been
stereotyped by middle-class education and comfortable middle-class
values. Those dockers taught me something, and I think I can teach them
and their like something in return. Strange, isn't it? Although, while
I was with them, I was the somnolent ass, now, looking back, I find I
have stored up a lot of valuable material from those days." To my
suggestion that he was sentimentalising them in reaction against the
snobbery of his somnolent state, he answered frankly that I with my
lower-middle-class origins and unconscious respect for my social
"superiors", was the real snob, and that I could not be fair to the
workers.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, "you yourself have often said that the only
hope for our rotten old society is education, real education, not for
the few privileged people but for all of us. Democracy can't possibly
work unless there is a truly educated mass of citizens. Well, I shall
try my hand at this most important of all jobs, educating ordinary
adults. Oh, I know it's a pretty hopeless task. And of course it can't
be done properly so long as economic conditions and the whole social
climate are forcing us in the wrong direction. But we must make a
beginning. And it's going to be my job to help. Yes, I see quite
clearly that this is my job." Then he made a remark that stirred me in
spite of my scepticism. "Some day, Harry, probably long after we are
dead, the great majority of people in this island, yes, and in the
world, will be decent, friendly, well-balanced, informed, critical,
really human beings. And then, God, what glorious new horizons will
begin to open up for our species! At present we are a self-frustrating,
self- wounding, hobbled species, blinded by its conditions. But then we
shall find ourselves."</p>

<p>As I had to leave by a very early train next day, I brought our
conversation to a close. Persuading Victor not to rise early on my
account, I said "goodbye" there and then in the lounge. I promised to
do what I could to help him to secure the kind of work he wanted, and
he thanked me for befriending him in his crisis. Of course I replied
that I was very glad to have been taken fully into his confidence, and
that I hoped we might see more of each other. To this suggestion he
heartily assented. I went upstairs to pack my hired wedding
garments.</p>

<h2>5 - NEW START</h2>

<h4>From 1921 to 1924</h4>

<p>IT WAS NEARLY THREE YEARS before I saw Victor again. A few weeks
after the wedding fiasco I put him in touch with a friend of mine in
the adult education movement, and in due course he was accepted as
staff tutor for extra-mural work under one of the northern
universities. I had hoped to meet him during the latter part of the
summer, but we could not arrange a date suitable to both of us.
Meanwhile I had an attractive offer of a post as teacher of English in
a school in France. Before I left the country, Victor wrote to say that
he was hard at work preparing his lectures for the winter. He was
doubtful about his capacity for the job. "Honour Mods" and "Greats",
Greek and Latin Literature and Philosophy, seemed a poor equipment for
teaching English artisans and housewives industrial history and
economics. But in those days a classical education was thought to fit
one for any kind of teaching post, certainly for the informal work
which Victor had chosen. Moreover Victor was a very attractive
candidate. His enthusiasm could not be doubted, for he had given up a
brilliant career in business for the sake of adult education; and he
obviously had a gift for personal contacts and for interesting people
ill the life of the mind. I had no doubt that he would make a success
of the job; but he was anxious, and he felt compelled to devote the
remainder of the summer to studying his new subjects. So he settled
into cheap lodgings in the great provincial town which was to be his
headquarters, and divided his time between study and making contacts
with local people connected with the movement. While I was in France I
occasionally wrote to Victor, and I received a few very brief and
uninformative notes from him. Evidently he was making a good start. The
work, he said, was "immensely stimulating, but exasperating ". We
planned to meet during the summer vacation. But when I suggested a
walking tour in the Lakes, it proved impossible to fix a date. He had
to attend summer schools where members of adult classes gathered
together to combine further education and holiday-making. "Also," he
said, "I have new ties, which I will tell you about sometime."</p>

<p>It was clear that Victor felt no need to see me; and so, with some
disappointment, I refrained from pressing the matter. I tried to
persuade him to write to me about those "new ties", but he remained
silent.</p>

<p>The same thing happened when I suggested a meeting during the second
summer; and again in the third.</p>

<p>But late in the fourth summer, when I was already in London on my
way back to France, I received a note from Victor, forwarded from home
by my mother. He proposed that we should meet and have a talk about
"something important to me and interesting to you". The reasonable
reply was that unfortunately it was too late, as I was crossing the
Channel on the following day. And after all, why should I put myself
out for someone who had practically ignored me for three years? But
where Victor was concerned, 1 often found it hard to be reasonable. I
telephoned to him, saying that if he really wanted to see me, he must
come up to London on the following day. To my surprise, he agreed. I
booked a room for him at my hotel, for the one night. Then I cabled to
France postponing my arrival for a day.</p>

<p>Next day, I met him at Euston, and we went to a modest Soho
restaurant with a Balkan flavour. When we had given our order, we
smilingly studied each other, and made small talk. I reminded him of
the 'previous occasion when we had fed together; and I asked him if he
remembered the ugly waitress. He paused for a moment as though trying
to recollect, then said, "Oh, yes, of course. Ugly, but very beautiful.
Curious how blind you are in some directions, Harry!" He fell silent,
and I waited.</p>

<p>Over our minestrone we at first talked at random, and I studied his
appearance. He had not changed much, but he did look appreciably older.
His forehead bore upright lines above the nose. Crow's feet spread from
the corners of his eyes. But he seemed physically fit, and his eyes
were obviously the eyes of the awake Victor. There was no camel-like
droop of the eyelids, no mulish complacency about the mouth.</p>

<p>Before we had finished our soup I brought Victor to the point by
reminding him that he wanted to discuss something. He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I thought I'd like to tell you a thing or two. In
the old days I often found I could straighten things out in my mind by
talking to you: You're such a damned good listener."</p>

<p>Then he fell silent again, and seemed wholly intent on the flavour
of his beer. I waited some time, and then I said, "I hope your job is
suiting you." He raised his eyes to mine with an expression (I thought)
of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "it suits me alright. Things haven't quite gone
according to plan, but they're certainly going somewhere."</p>

<p>He poured out a long and interesting account of his work, but I
suspected that he clung to this theme in order to put off opening up
some other, more ticklish subject. He said he was kept fairly busy,
with five evening classes a week, and occasional lectures at week-
ends. Much time was occupied by travelling. One of his classes was in
the university itself, but the others were in towns ranging from thirty
to a hundred-and-fifty miles distant. He had constantly to be working
up his subjects, and he had acquired the habit of doing a lot of
serious reading and lecture-preparing in the train.</p>

<p>"My real trouble," he said, "is that I don't feel that economics and
industrial history are the right medium for genuine education. Of
course they're very important. People who are already more or less
educated can use them, and indeed must have them; but for uneducated
people they can be the very devil. A lot of people who come to us are
simple souls who are generously aware of the rottenness of society, and
impatient for a theory about it; and eager for action. Others are badly
warped by sheer class-hatred (I don't blame them), and they simply want
to have material for proving the capitalists wicked and the workers
saints."</p>

<p>I suggested that you could only educate people through subjects that
interested them and had some relation to their own lives.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he said, "In theory that's fine; but if the subject is
too close to them, they can't think objectively about it at all. They
have made up their minds before they begin to study; like a certain
brass-founder in one of my classes, who was stumped by some argument of
mine, so he just looked at me with great ox-eyes, and said, 'Young man,
I don't rightly know where you're wrong, but I know you are
wrong!'"</p>

<p>Victor gave me one of his boyish grins. Presently he continued, "You
see, we are supposed to be creating an educated democracy, but we
haven't really even begun to tackle that job yet; and I don't see that
we ever shall, unless we change our whole approach. We are supposed to
be giving something like a university education to the working
population of this country. But of course we can't possibly do anything
of the sort, except in a few cases. A university education involves all
sorts of things that the members of our extramural classes can't
possibly bring. It involves young and supple minds full of vigour and
curiosity. It involves access to plenty of books. It involves intensive
tuition, and heaps of time for reading and writing. But our students
are mostly far from young; their minds are already set; they come to
the job after a hard day's work; they're not capable of serious study,
because they have never learnt what serious study means; they can't
read heavy books; they find great difficulty in expressing themselves
in writing; they mostly mistake asseveration for genuine discussion.
Then again, we are supposed to be appealing to every man's latent
passion to be an intelligent and responsible citizen and a fully
conscious human being; but even if Everyman unwittingly needs culture,
the need is seldom a conscious desire, let alone a passion that will
drive him to surmount the frightful difficulties that stand in his way.
The good souls we do get hold of don't really want the life of the mind
at all. They want either a little easy entertainment after the serious
part of the day is over, or the cachet of being an educated person. Or
else they come in search of data and propaganda to use against their
political opponents. Mind you, I don't blame them for these motives. In
their circumstances they were bound to want these things. But you can't
create an educated democracy on that basis. We are supposed to be
building Jerusalem in England's green and pleasant minds (and, God,
they're green all right); but we are not going about it in the right
way. Mind you, we are doing something well worth doing, in its own
little way. But we are not doing what we pretend we are doing; because
(a) we are affecting only a minute proportion of the total population,
and (b) the few that we do catch absorb merely a smattering."</p>

<p>Victor's tirade was interrupted by the arrival of the waiter with
our pseudo-exotic Balkan dish. To my surprise Victor asked the lean and
swarthy young man whether he had read the works of some writer with a
Slavonic name, unknown to me. The waiter froze into immobility, with my
helping of vegetables poised in the air. Then he looked down at
Victor's upturned face for a moment, and said with emphasis and a
smile, "Yes, and you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Victor, "but I have heard of him. You are not
afraid?"</p>

<p>The waiter replied, "Because of him I must leave my country." He
moved away.</p>

<p>"You see," said Victor, "lots of these fellows from the backward
fringes of Europe are ready to take risks for what they regard as
education; but our people, mostly, just don't care." I protested that
the man must be unique, and I asked how Victor had spotted him as one
of the few who cared. Victor refused to admit that the man was unique.
"His sort are a minority, no doubt, but a considerable minority. How
did I spot him? Surely it's written all over his face, his walk, the
way he moves his hands. And didn't you see how he handled the book I
asked him to put aside for me?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for my reply he continued, "What I want to know is,
why is there no such considerable minority in this country? Why are we
nearly all such bone-headed philistines, and proud of it? Is it, I
wonder, just because bad education has been forced on us at school, so
that we are hardened against the life of the mind for ever? You ought
to know, as a schoolteacher. What do you really do with the little
animals when you have them in your clutches?" I pointed out that the
school was forced to concentrate on fitting the child to earn a living
in a commercial society, which involved simply drumming in the three
R's and a lot of necessary facts. "Yes," he said, "That's the snag. But
do you or don't you try to make it all come alive in their minds? And
do you help them to get some sense of life as--well, a spiritual
adventure?" I laughed, and protested that this was impossible, in view
of the mental limitations of the average child and the economic
limitations of the average home. But I claimed that some few of us did
try; and still fewer actually succeeded, in a small way, with a few of
our pupils. But most teachers themselves lacked the vision, and anyhow
they were much too hard pressed to do anything about it. Victor sighed,
and said, "Oh, yes, I know, I know. In fact we're in a vicious infinite
regress. You can't educate adults unless they have been properly
educated as children; and you can't get them properly educated as
children unless you have enough properly educated teachers, and a sound
educational system, and unless in their homes they are in contact with
educated parents. In adult education we are supposed to satisfy a
native need for culture. I'm not saying there's no such need, but
simply that in this country it has been suffocated. And so, instead of
attracting millions to our adult classes, we laboriously rope in
thousands."</p>

<p>I protested that the movement had done wonders, in spite of
everything. He replied, "Oh, no doubt, in a way, particularly in the
early days; and with quite a different sort of result from what was
intended."</p>

<p>I asked him to explain. For some moments he ate in silence, then
said, "The pioneers of our great; movement (and it is a great movement
in spite of everything) had a romantic purpose. On the one hand were
the universities, seats of culture and refinement, on the other the
workers, unconsciously needing culture and refinement, starving for it,
though unwittingly. Or again, on the one hand, the universities could
provide the inspiration for dispassionate study and objective
investigation; on the other the workers could provide the drive for
thoroughgoing social change. Our movement, obviously, was intended to
bring the two together. What the pioneers had to do was to present
culture to the workers in the right way (not the academic way
precisely, but a warm, human, simplified wayn that was yet academically
sound), and the workers would come flocking to the movement. And so, in
time there would arise a new kind of democracy, in which the plain man
would be right-hearted, and right-headed, reasonably well informed
about society and about true values, capable of wise action and wise
voting. It was a glorious vision. At last philosophers would rule;
because power would lie with the people, and the great majority of the
people would be philosophers. Well, it's difficult enough to produce
one philosopher, let alone forty-five million."</p>

<p>I said he was exaggerating. The aim was not to produce philosophers
but responsible citizens. I insisted that the ordinary human being had
it in him to be a responsible citizen, given decent conditions. "Oh,
quite," said Victor, "he has it in him while he is a baby, but
conditions go all wrong from then onwards."</p>

<p>After a pause, he continued, "But that is not the whole trouble. In
fact there are two other troubles. First, the best academic brains, the
really first-class people, are (quite rightly) so intent on research,
and so hard pressed with teaching and administration in the university,
that they don't take on extramural work and do it whole- heartedly.
And, anyhow, few of them have the gift for it; for, believe me, it
demands a very special technique, which we are only just beginning to
learn. So the job has to be done largely by people who, though they may
be first-class human beings, are not quite first-class academically;
because, no matter how intelligent they may be, their hearts are not
wholly devoted to academic study and research. What they really care
about is rather kindling the masses. Take me, for instance; though
perhaps I am worse than the average, because, of course, I simply had
to cram to do the job at all."</p>

<p>I interrupted, "But what does it matter that they're not quite
first- class academically? They have to teach the essentials not the
minutiae. It's their gift for teaching that matters. And I'm sure you
have that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "the teaching-gift does matter a lot, but so
does the academic expertism. If you haven't got it, you can't always
deal properly either with honest criticism or with the propaganda
bilge; not absolutely adequately. But this is where my second point
comes in, and it's more fundamental. The whole idea of giving the
essence of culture without the details, in fact of 'university
standard' without minutiae, is impossible. It's trying to have the cake
and eat it. The result is that some of our adult students, hypnotized
by the academic ideal, plunge for thoroughness, get mental indigestion,
and are obsessed with the idea of 'seeing both sides of every
question', so that they become paralysed, and useless for the
revolution, which, after all, is the supreme goal; while others,
feeling in their bones that something is amiss, become more prejudiced
and propagandist than ever."</p>

<p>Suddenly Victor saw that my plate was empty and his own scarcely
touched. He attacked it with fury, while I sat wondering how to bring
him to the point. When he had finished, the waiter returned to take
away our plates. Victor said to him, "Do you find time to read much
over here?"</p>

<p>"Not much time," he answered. "Here I read only English,
difficultly."</p>

<p>I asked him what he had read. With a deprecating shrug he replied,
"Lord Byron, Shakespeare (he is difficult), Mill ('On Liberty'),
Bertand Russell (on happiness). But why," he said with animation, "do
the English not read their own great literature?"</p>

<p>Victor laughed triumphantly, and said, "Because at school they are
made to hate it."</p>

<p>I was increasingly wondering what it was that Victor had come all
the way to London to talk about; so over the sweet I challenged him to
come to the point. Instead of answering, he plunged back into the old
subject.</p>

<p>He said, "Don't suppose I think the thing we are doing is just a
waste of time. It's quite important as a first step. We are not
creating an educated democracy, but we are creating-I was going to say
'an educated &eacute;lite' within the great Labour Movement; but I had
better say, a socially informed &eacute;lite who have at least some
idea of what the aim of education ought to be. I foresee a time when
the House of Commons will be dominated by a Labour Party whose members
will mostly have been mentally formed in our classes. It's tempting to
think that such a House will really get going on the job of creating an
educated democracy. But it won't be able to do it unless it forms an
adult education movement of a new kind, not giving sham university
education, but working out new aims and methods, much freer and less
formal. Yes, and if those enlightened Labour M.P.s mean business, they
will have to insist on compulsory adult education for everyone." Here I
burst in with a protest that real education could never be compulsory.
He replied, "That's an over-simplification. The stalwarts of our
movement insist on it, but I'm beginning to doubt it. We shall have to
change our minds in the end, otherwise we shall never catch the people
who need education most. Of course, when they are compelled, we shall
have to find out how to make them glad they were compelled. People will
put up with compulsion all right if the aim of the compulsion is
manifestly a good one, and if they believe that they themselves gave
power to the compelling government. Think how much compulsion is
accepted in Russia, for the sake of the new revolutionary state."</p>

<p>I snorted indignantly, but he carried on, "Oh, yes, you'll see. What
I'm afraid of is that sooner or later some semi-political or pseudo-
religious movement, that really has the courage of its convictions,
will persuade the masses to accept compulsion for quite wrong ends.
Maybe it won't happen here, but it might quite well happen in some
socially tormented and half-crazy country; like Germany, for instance,
when the pathetic republic has gone phut. And then!"</p>

<p>Over the coffee I tried again to bring Victor to the point. "Do you
ever regret your old life?" I said. "Do you ever-slip back into your
old self?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "I certainly never regret the old life; and so
far I have not slipped back into my old self. But I don't feel really
secure. Sometimes I have a sort of dizzy feeling, which is a warning.
And sometimes I feel I must have more than my normal two or three hours
sleep. So I may slip away at any time. That is why every moment is so
precious. As for regretting the old life, good God, no! There's so much
more to be learnt and enjoyed in the new one, exasperating as it is. I
like the people better. Not that I have a grudge against business
people. Fundamentally they're just as good stuff as the artisans,
teachers and housewives that I deal with. But they're under the spell
of the commercial system that they run. They can't see that it's played
out. And so they're mentally backward, and it's very hard to make any
real contact with them. I don't mean they're unintelligent. Probably on
the average they're brighter than our people. But they can't use their
intelligence except within the commercial universe of discourse. They
are incredibly backward in social, thought; and they're blinkered by a
false view of human nature, inherited from the nineteenth century, and
the doctrine of economic man. They tend to believe that man is
'fundamentally' or 'essentially' a self-regarding animal. And, of
course, this is a fine excuse for cut-throat commercialism. Even when
they want to be genuinely loyal to things other than themselves, they
tend to feel ashamed of doing so, regarding it as 'sheer
sentimentality', And when at last their nature rebels against
commercialism, they tend to flounder back into a very na&iuml;ve
Christianity."</p>

<p>I said I thought all classes had come under the influence of the
false view of human nature, and that artisans and teachers were really
just as backward as clerks and business magnates.</p>

<p>"Many of them, no doubt are," he said. "But some really are breaking
away from the old ideas and values. They can't very well help it. Their
circumstances force it on them. You see they're up against it. The men
are either actually unemployed or scared stiff of becoming unemployed.
They see and feel the system breaking up; and the old values breaking
up, too. Individualism stinks in their nostrils. And they feel they're
all members of one another, dependent on one another. And so there's
quite often a very effective social goodwill about them; which is rare
among the business people, just because they're mentally hobbled by the
commercial ideology. But, of course, the social goodwill of the workers
is often restricted to working- class loyalty, or side-tracked by the
bread-winner's desperate need to fight individualistically in the
struggle for a job. And, of course, there are plenty of rotters, people
who think nothing matters so long as one spouts class war; people who
are socialists in theory and individualists in action. For instance,
there's a man in one of my classes, always gassing, always
propaganding, always dishonest in argument, never reads the stuff I
set, never writes an essay, always arrives late and expects to be
recorded on the register as present (for grant-earning purposes),
always imputes bad motives to the secretary (who keeps the register and
doesn't falsify it), or to me, or to the wicked capitalists. Contrast
that blighter with another talkative bloke, superficially similar, but
how different! He's fat, keen, equally doctrinaire, theoretically a
hard-boiled materialist and stern self-seeker, but; in practice he's
well above the average of kindliness and self-sacrifice; in fact,
unwittingly a worshipper of the Christian God who is Love, whom he
consciously pokes fun at on every possible occasion, much to the
annoyance of other members. Then there's an old grey-head who is an
orthodox rationalist. He keeps giving me ribald verses about Jesus
Christ and the Church, and about Queen Victoria. One of the best men I
have come across is a boiler- maker. Sometimes I have a meal in his
home. A real good type, but desperately harassed. Likely to be sacked
any day, because trade is bad, and a real slump is coming. Wife and two
children. Nice clean little kitchen-sitting-room, overcrowded with
nicknacks--china dogs, toby jugs, bright copper kettles, antimacassars,
and the proverbial aspidistra. Last time, I noticed that the piano had
gone. They didn't refer to it, and I didn't like to be nosy, but I feel
sure it has been pawned. Bright little talkative wife, but too
obviously anxious to keep the skeleton unseen in the cupboard. Boy at
the local grammar school; girl hoping for a scholarship at the
university. The father is pathetically keen to give them both a good
education, but his very real enthusiasm for the life of the mind gets
on the boy's nerves. In fact he is reacting pretty violently against
it. He obviously prefers toughness, and is always getting into scrapes
as leader of a gang of hooligans at school."</p>

<p>Victor paused, so I said, "And the women?"</p>

<p>"Educationally," he said, "they are generally below the male
standard. And it's very difficult to get them talking. But they are
certainly quite as intelligent as the men; only less informed, and
diffident."</p>

<p>Maliciously I asked if any attractive ones came to the classes.</p>

<p>"What you mean," he said, "is, have I succumbed to any of them. Of
course not. It would interfere with business. Besides, the younger ones
are mostly rather dim; though a few are quite charming in a way--sweet
rosebuds blighted by a hostile climate. The really attractive girls
mostly don't come, because of course, they have a better way of amusing
themselves. Some of the women who do come take it very seriously. But
most of these are middle-aged. There are a good many hard-working
housewives, who obviously have no time to read or write, but like to be
on the fringes of intellectual life. Then there are the inevitable
spinsters who have nothing else to do, and are apt to take the line
that if only people would be kind to each other, we shouldn't have any
social problems. The more frustrated women, of all ages, are too ready
to fall in love with the class tutor, which complicates matters. The
unfrustrated ones naturally have other fish to fry." After a pause, he
added, "And so have I."</p>

<p>He did not develop this statement, but called the waiter for the
bill. After a polite wrangle as to who should pay, in which Victor, as
usual got the best of it, I suggested that we should go to the hotel
and find a quiet corner where we could discuss whatever it was that he
had on his mind. He nodded assent as he paid the bill.</p>

<p>I was staying in a cheap little hotel near Euston, run by a Swiss
couple, and much patronized by foreigners. As we entered the stuffy
lounge, a babel of foreign speech assailed us. I remember a middle-
aged man with hair cut en brosse, who was leaning forward earnestly
talking German to a sullen woman with smooth black hair and a
streamlined black velvet; dress. Further afield, two children were
building cardhouses, and occasionally exclaiming in French. A Nordic
god was arguing in too-correct English with a scraggy little Cockney.
Slavonic speech came from a group clustered round a table.</p>

<p>We found a vacant couch with the leather split and horsehair
protruding, and I ordered drinks. When we had toasted each other, I
said, "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Victor, "I'm ready now. I wanted to get the background
clear for you first. And I wanted-to see how my problem felt in your
presence, before I began telling you about it. I guess you've guessed
that it's concerned with the ugly waitress, the superbly beautiful
Maggie."</p>

<p>He then plunged into his story; but 1 shall not attempt to report it
in his words. Instead, I shall give my own account of it, based partly
on his version and partly on what I subsequently learned from Maggie
herself. Not that there was any serious discrepancy. But Maggie's
comments were often enlightening.</p>

<p>Evidently she had had a deeper effect on him than I had supposed. He
had stayed on at his hotel for some days in order to make a secure
contact with her. Apparently his courtship was of a very eccentric
kind, and her reception of it was equally odd.</p>

<p>On the morning after the wedding day, he had met her in a corridor.
"Good morning," he said; and she replied with her hippopotamus smile,
"Good morning, sir." He smilingly barred her way, and remarked, "You
are the loveliest thing I have ever seen." With a gasp of indignation,
she turned to retreat; but he said, "Hi! Don't run away! This is
important for us both, and you know it is." She turned and looked at
him (he said) with contempt; and he felt so abashed that he could do
nothing but stare dumbly at her. She said, "It's cruel to tell a girl
she's lovely when she has a face like mine." There were tears in her
eyes as she added, "I suppose you think you'll get me cheap because I'm
ugly. I suppose you think I'm so ugly I'll do anything for a bit of
flattery." He still gazed at her, and said nothing. (She afterwards
told me that he looked like a dog asking for a tit-bit.) Presently he
said, "The night before I came here, when I was falling asleep, I saw
your face as clearly as I do now, just for a moment, and then you were
gone. I have seen your face, between sleeping and waking, off-and on
ever since I was a child. I can't really remember the time when I
didn't see it. At first it was always the face of a very little girl,
but as I grew it grew. When I was a schoolboy, I was rather annoyed
that a silly, little, podgy girl should butt in like that. Later I got
interested, and tried to hold you longer, but you always vanished after
a few seconds. Sometimes I saw you in a brown jersey, sometimes in a
little black sou'wester."</p>

<p>She interrupted, "It's a pretty story, but it won't do. On the first
day when you were here, you took no notice of me, except to scowl at me
as if I was a mess. What's more, you seem to forget that you have dined
here lots of times before, generally with the young lady you didn't
marry yesterday. And you never took any notice of me, except once when
you looked at me and then said something to her, and you both
laughed."</p>

<p>He answered, "I can explain all that, but it's a strange story, and
it will take some time. First, I can easily prove that I really have
seen you, in that drowsy state before sleeping. As a schoolgirl you
used to wear your hair in two heavy pigtails hanging down in front of
your shoulders. One night, about five years ago, when you were in the
late teens, I saw you with your left eye tight shut, with blood and
tears oozing out of it, and tears streaming from the other eye. After
that you used to have a black shade over the left eye. It was many
months before I saw you without it."</p>

<p>This bit of information had startled her. In a serious voice she
said, "I fell against a fence with a big nail in it. They thought I
should lose the eye."</p>

<p>At that moment their conversation was interrupted by someone walking
along the corridor. They parted.</p>

<p>Later, he contrived to meet her again, and said, "About my not
noticing you on those times-" But again they were interrupted. He had
only time to say, "When is your day off? I must tell you more. It's
important for both of us." She moved off without replying.</p>

<p>However, two days later he did secure her for her free afternoon. At
her request, he took her to walk in the country. She was a country
girl; and although she had deserted the country for the town, she liked
to use her free time for fresh air and exercise. They travelled out by
bus, and she took him along one of her favourite tracks through fields
and woods.</p>

<p>He told her about his divided personality, and explained that,
though he could have his waking dream of her in either of his two
states, yet in the somnolent state he could never remember anything
about it. Consequently, when he actually met her in that state, she
meant nothing to him, except that he felt an unreasonable loathing of
her. But in the lucid state he could remember even the occasions when
she had appeared to him in the other state. "When at last," he said, "I
(the real 'I') met you in the flesh, I recognized you at once."</p>

<p>After a while they rested in a meadow. She lay at full length with
her hand behind her head (so he told me), and her ample breasts (very
unfashionable in those days) rising and falling under her cheap cotton
dress. The sun was full on her face, and her eyes were shut. Her sturdy
coltish legs, in the precious black silk stockings that were then
displacing cashmere, were crossed like a crusader's on his tomb. She
was chewing a feathery grass stem.</p>

<p>He said, "How I long to make love to you, but I won't, not yet. I
want to explain things properly first." She turned her head and looked
at him quizzically through one screwed-up eye, because of the sun.
"Aren't you a caution!" she said "But go on, it's interesting."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "before I met you (before 'I' met you, not the
other blighter that I hate), I grew to get a terrific kick out of your
rare visitations. I don't quite know why. It wasn't just that I had
grown to see that you were beautiful, in a queer way that I had never
come across before; in addition I seemed to make some sort of direct
contact with your personality, simply through my visual image of your
face in all its fluctuating expression,"</p>

<p>"Don't be so pompous," she said. "Speak ordinary. I'm not a public
meeting. And I'm not clever."</p>

<p>He explained his meaning in simpler words, and added, "Funny isn't
it? I don't know anything about your life; and yet I do know, just from
knowing your face so well, that you're intelligent and sensitive, and
quite able to understand anything I want to say to you, so long as I
don't use words you're not used to." Maggie told me later that at this
she was secretly pleased, because she had always wanted to be
intelligent and sensitive, and able to appreciate the subtleties of
language. But she would not tell Victor this; not at this early stage
of their acquaintance. She said, "You think you know me, but I bet you
don't really. You have told yourself a lot of pretty rubbish about that
face you used to see. And it just happens to be a bit like my awful
mug."</p>

<p>"We shall see," he said. "And what about the damaged eye? Anyhow,
one thing I am absolutely sure about. We need each other. Neither of us
can be fully alive without the other."</p>

<p>Laughing, she threw her chewed grass in his face, and said, "Speak
for yourself, Mr. Stranger! I'm quite happy without you." She jumped
up, like a fresh colt, and said, "Come along! I want my tea." They
continued their walk.</p>

<p>They came to a stile; and as she was climbing over it, her foot
slipped on the mossy wood, and she fell rather heavily. She expected
him to rush to her assistance and lift her to her feet, and fuss over
her; but though he made a quick movement, he stopped, and stood with
his hands in his pockets, while she sat on the ground rubbing her knee
and grieving over her torn stocking. He merely said, "Bad luck! The
step must be slippery," and waited for her to pick herself up. She
clambered to her feet again, and limped along the path. They walked in
silence, and she deliberately maintained the limp after the knee had
recovered. She could not help being mortified at his indifference. Also
she was startled to find how disappointed she was that he had not put
his arms round her to lift her, nor even offered her an arm for
walking. A horrid thought haunted her. He was not really in love with
her at all. He was in love with his dream-pictures of her. Probably he
secretly found her repulsive, as so many other men obviously did. He
wouldn't let himself see this fact; but when an opportunity arose to
touch her, he couldn't bring himself to do so. The thought hardened her
against him. She suddenly felt desperately lonely.</p>

<p>As if in answer to this thought, he lightly, fleetingly, and yet
(she said) lingeringly held her hand, and murmured, "To find you at
last is to find home."</p>

<p>"You are a queer one," she said, "not my sort at all."</p>

<p>He promptly answered, "Oh, yes I am. You'll see. But there's
something I must make quite clear before I clamour for you. You see, I
earnestly want to spend all my life with you, but the other fellow, my
hateful other self, may oust me at any moment. And he loathes you, and
he would treat you horribly. So I must; make you see the danger you are
up against in loving me."</p>

<p>She stood still and faced him. "Look here," she said, "you're
forgetting something. It takes two to make a love affair, and I'm not
in love with you."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Thank God you're not--yet. That's why I want to get
it all clear at once. Because when you are, you will find it hard to
judge the situation dispassionately.</p>

<p>"You and your long words!" she said. Then she added, "I suppose it
never struck you I might have other fish to fry?"</p>

<p>He answered, "Oh, yes, I know. Just as I had. But you and I belong
together. You will soon find that's true--unless we nip the whole thing
in the bud right now. But I don't really think we can keep apart; we
are tangled up togeher fundamentally, somehow."</p>

<p>At this she exclaimed, "But I tell you I don't feel the slightest
need of you. I don't know you at all, except that you are a bit
cracked. And you don't know me at all."</p>

<p>He answered, "I know almost nothing about you, and yet I know so
much. I know you want to be--well, fully alive, awake. To experience as
fully as possible, and--to behave creatively." She sighed, and said, "I
don't even know what you mean by that. All I want is to have a good
time, and a job I can enjoy doing. I'm quite happy at the hotel for the
present."</p>

<p>They walked on in silence, for the length of a field. Then Victor
said, "Well, I'm putting my cards on the table. I'm certain we need one
another; but there's my accursed other self. Yet, in spite of that, I'm
sure it's really best for you that you should take me on. But you must
realize the danger fully, and face it calmly. So must I, on your
account. Some men in my position would just hold off, for the girl's
sake; even if they needed her as desperately as I do. And indeed, my
dear, I do need you desperately. If you won't have me, I shall never be
fully myself. I shall break up, sooner or later. But objectively that
doesn't greatly matter. The point is that for your sake, quite as much
as my own, I believe we should unite. What I offer you is a possibility
of real fullness of life, though a life that will often be unhappy and
may bring you disaster. But without me you will certainly miss what is
best in life."</p>

<p>"Look!" she said, "I'm not in love with you, but if I was really in
love with you, I wouldn't funk it because of the danger. I'd go through
hell for you. And even now, when I don't love you, I don't say 'Keep
off, it's not fair to make love to a girl if you know you may betray
her.' No! If you can show me that you are the man for me, I'll not be
afraid. I'll take you on." She swung round, smiled squarely at him,
putout a hand, and said, "Shake on it!" Laughing, he took her hand,
shook it heartily, and held it till she took it from him.</p>

<h2>6 - MAGGIE'S EARLY LIFE</h2>

<h4>From 1897 to 1921</h4>

<p>THE CRISIS OF VICTOR'S WALK with Maggie was now over. After a little
silence, they began talking happily about indifferent matters.
Presently they came to a little cottage that offered teas. They had
their meal in the garden, sitting together on a bench before a rickety
little table, facing the view. Maggie told me that through that meal
and the rest of their walk she had an increasing sense that they had
known one another for many years. Again and again they anticipated each
other's thoughts, as though each knew beforehand what to expect of the
other. Yet consciously they knew very little of each other, and their
minds were very different--Victor with his background of public school
and Oxford, Maggie a country girl with simple tastes and a veneer of
town experience. Yet so long as they did not discuss their own future,
they talked easily and happily. In spite of differences of accent and
social class, each delighted each by quick intuition of the other's
point of view.</p>

<p>Maggie was soon telling Victor about her own life. Her early years
were spent in Shetland. She was born in a minute crofter's cottage
beside one of the larger "voes" or fjords. Her father was a typical
Shetlander, who made a precarious living by a combination of fishing by
line or net from a boat, tending the little hardy though soft- fleeced
sheep, and tilling the impoverished and storm-swept soil, which yielded
oats and rye as dwarfed as the sheep and the famous ponies. Rambingly
and with evident nostalgia, Maggie told Victor how she used to take
part in the fishing; how, holding the line, one had to feel for the
gentle tremor when the fish nibbled the bait, distinguishing between
the different action of whiting, haddock and the rest; how in the old
days cod were plentiful in the coastal waters and within range of small
boats, but now they had to be sought far off in the Arctic by
long-ranging steam trawlers; how the herring fishery, at one time
prosperous, had retreated to the south, leaving behind broken-down
jetties and the rotting remains of the fishing fleet in almost every
village; how her father used to take out his gun and shoot the seals
from the cliff, and the dead or merely wounded creatures, tortured by
the salt water in their wounds, would be left on the rocks by the next
retreating tide, to be retrieved at leisure by the men of the crofts;
how the cruel business distressed her, but gradually she hardened
herself to it, knowing well how much the meat and oil and skin were
needed; how, when she was about twelve years old, one of her elder
brothers was lost in a storm, having gone out beyond the headlands in
an unseaworthy boat, against his father's advice; how she herself,
weeks later, happened on his decaying body on the rocks, damaged,
bloated, blackened by corruption, but still recognizably her brother;
and how this experience had "somehow opened a window on to the evil of
the world ", so that for years afterwards she was prone to "waking
nightmares" in which she was paralysed by the shocking memory of that
strange thing that had been her brother; how her eldest brother became
a deck-hand on a liner, and would periodically return from the Far East
with strange gifts and stranger stories; how these homecomings used to
fill her with a fierce determination to see the great world, though she
was only a girl; how the eider-ducks piloted their flotillas of tiny
babies on the turbulent waves, and in among the rocks; how the stylish
arctic skuas and the great brown "bonxies" would dive screaming from
the sky to threaten the head of any child venturing too near their
nests; how the gannets, dagger-beaked, creamy headed, wing-tipped with
ink, would drop like stones into the sea for fish, and the cormorants
would come up from the deep with their writhing bulky catch, and
struggle valiantly to swallow it, till at last it showed merely as a
great swelling in the bird's neck; how a dead whale was once stranded
at the mouth of the voe, and how it stank; how one of the boys once
carried home on his shoulder a whale's vertebra, a lump of sea-polished
solid bone as big as a new grindstone, but triangular and with a hole
in the middle for the great spinal cord; how she and her school friends
used to play in a near-by "broch", a stone-built Pictish fortress, on a
high cliff over the sea; how her mother used to plant their cabbages in
queer little circles of stone wall, like miniature brochs, to protect
them from the ruthless winds; how at midnight in the summer, the grass
was still green and the water blue; but in winter, noon was just an
evening between two interminable dead black nights, relieved sometimes
by the pale or rosy Northern Lights; how the whole family would
sometimes go by boat, sailing or rowing, inland to the head of the voe
to cut peat on the low moors, and stack it to dry (like slabs of moist
ginger cake, she said); and how, long afterwards, they would go again
to load the dried peat on to the boat and bring it home; how in fine
weather one could see far out on the horizon a small, tall, lonely
island where several families won a meagre living from the ocean and
the scanty pasture, and sometimes (it was said) great storms swept
their houses over the cliff into the seas; how she was sometimes taken
by her father on sheep-dipping or fleecing expeditions, with a party of
men, boys and dogs from the neighbouring crofts, generally by boat to
some remote promontory, to spend the day in the orchestration of
bleatings, barkings, human shoutings, the cries of gulls, and of course
the wind; how the "national sport" of the Shetlanders (Shelties, she
sometimes called them) was racing their Norse-looking sailing craft at
regattas in one little port after another; how the family boasted about
their own old elegant and often successful boat, and their father's
seamanship; how she used to walk over the hill to the village school
beside a neighbouring voe, often in wild weather, dry in her little
black oil-skins; how on Sundays the whole family, father, mother, two
aunts, three boys and two girls, would follow the same track over the
hill to the little Methodist chapel, all dressed in their precious
Sunday clothes, she with her wild red hair tightly plaited and her
sturdy little legs clad in the inevitable home-knitted black woollen
stockings; how on one occasion a blue-eyed young lay preacher, who was
also the local blacksmith (idolized by the young girls for his mighty
prowess at the anvil, and for his radiant kindliness), gave them a
terrific sermon all about hell-fire and shipwreck; how the fire, he
said, rose up from the depth of the ocean and devoured the proud ships
with their ungodly crews, and sucked them down into the nether pit for
eternal damnation; how, after the service, when the young man stood at
the chapel door to shake hands with each member of the congregation,
she dared hardly take his hand, though she saw, incredulously, that he
was once more beaming with good will; how, when her father once took
her to the far-off town of Lerwick, on the way she saw for the first
time trees, little stunted trees round a house in a sheltered valley,
but to her they were symbolical of all the world's forests and jungles;
how Lerwick seemed to her in those days a great bewildering glamourful
city, but in fact it was a small fishing port with narrow cobbled
streets and an all- pervading smell from the salting of innumerable
herrings; how she marvelled at the trawlers, the smart fisheries
gunboat, and the little old mail steamer; how she longed to go in the
steamer all the way to far-off Scotland, but such a trip was beyond the
family's means; how, even in those early days she began to be aware
that she was living only on the outermost fringe of a great exciting
dangerous modern world, in comparison with which her home life and all
its values were old-fashioned, niggardly and superstitious; how, as a
girl in her teens, she used to steal sweet meetings with a boy from
Glasgow, a very young engineer, who used to come to the village on a
motor-bike in connection with the setting up of a pumping engine; how
he scorned Shetland, and told her about the gay city life; how he once
took her for a wild pillion-ride on his motor-cycle, and her father
heard of it, and was furious; how, in the long dark winter evenings,
her mother and aunts, and often the two girls also, would sit spinning
the near- white or richly brown ("murrat") home-grown wool, or
knitting, or mending clothes, fishing-nets or lines, while her father
with a clay pipe in his mouth would be doing repairs to some tool, or
mending a wicker lobster-pot; how sometimes he would tell them stories
of the old days, or read aloud from "improving" books or Sir Walter
Scott's novels; for they had a couple of shelves stocked with well-used
classics and religious works, as in so many of the Shetland crofts; how
sometimes she would listen to her father with a deep sense of peace,
loving the little cramped, dark, overcrowded home and the feeling of
continuity with a mysterious romantic past; but sometimes she was
restless, aloof, exasperated with her grown-up relatives because of
their open contempt and secret fear of the new ways which were
constantly eating into the old; how she and her elder sister sometimes
went to the tiny croft of their Great-Aunt Abigail, to be given
bannocks and a glass of precious ginger-wine, but the old woman herself
would generally find some excuse for indulging in neat whisky or rum;
how the dark little croft was crammed with furniture and treasures
collected throughout a lifetime; how the kindly but alarming old witch
(for such she looked, with her tousled grey hair and bushy brows that
met over her nose, and her face of wrinkled leather) would sit by the
fire with bright and frightening eyes telling stories of tragic loves
and quarrels, of murders out at sea, of Pictish and Norse tradition, of
kelpies and howling invisible fiends that rode on the storm, and could
lift a man from his feet and throw him from a cliff; how sometimes in a
low voice her great-aunt would tell of her own reputedly occult powers
of second sight and control of people's behaviour; how, for instance,
she foretold the greatest storm of a century, and the wreck of a
full-rigged ship on the rocks below the broch; how she triumphed over a
wicked laird, who was the harsh landlord of all that district, by
compelling him to throw himself from a high cliff.</p>

<p>Maggie told Victor that she herself, being a very level-headed
child, was sceptical about all these stories, and yet fascinated by
them.</p>

<p>One thing she did not tell Victor till long afterwards. When Great-
Aunt Abigail was at the point of death she summoned her favourite
great-niece, Maggie, to a strictly private interview, and prophesied
that she, too, would develop strange powers. Meanwhile, she said,
Maggie herself, under the influence of the "great unbelieving world"
would grow to neglect "the old wisdom", till at last in suffering she
would discover that she, too, was a witch, with powers that she might
use for good or evil. The old lady said, "You will find, Maggie dear,
that you can be strong both in the old wisdom and in the new wisdom,
about which I know nothing but that the two clashing wisdoms are at
bottom one true wisdom." Her tired old eyes, that were still lit with
frightening fire, looked fixedly at the young girl; and presently she
said, "They will call you ugly, but you are beautiful. Most people are
too blind to see your beauty, and if any of these ever calls you
beautiful, he will be lying. But the very few, who can see, will see
that you are lovely with a very ancient and forgotten kind of
loveliness, or perhaps a new kind, still to win men's praise. I don't
know which." She gazed at the fascinated child; then said, "You must
try to do much better than I have done, wasting all my powers, and all
my life." She fell silent for some time, while Maggie gazed at her in
awe. Then Great-Aunt Abigail said, "Goodbye, dear Maggie. Remember
always what I have said. And now, go!"</p>

<p>With mingled fright, repugnance, affection and exaltation, Maggie
stooped and put her lips to the ancient leathery brow. But Great-Aunt
Abigail said, faintly but sharply, "On the lips, little fool; even if
it makes you vomit." Maggie brought herself to comply, murmured, "Dear
Great-Aunt Abigail!" and fled.</p>

<p>This exciting suggestion that she herself was a witch worked deeply
into young Maggie's mind; the more so since on one or two occasions she
had had dreams that seemed to turn out obscurely prophetic.</p>

<p>Maggie did not tell Victor about this death-bed scene; partly
because, though almost unconsciously she still cherished it, she had
long ago ceased to take her great-aunt's prophecy seriously, and had
ceased to have any of those ambiguous experiences that had seemed to
confirm it. Moreover, she feared that, if she told Victor, he would
think her credulous. Instead, she rambled on about her ordinary
memories, while Victor occasionally interjected some question or
friendly comment.</p>

<p>The sun was now sinking behind the trees, and the chill of evening
made them sit closely together, like well-tried brother and sister.</p>

<p>Maggie recounted how, when she left school, her parents reluctantly
sent her into "service" in Lerwick, to add to the family earnings; how
she wept on the day of departure, but how, as she settled into the new
life she became more and more dependent on the excitement of this
minute metropolis, and more determined to seek her fortune in some
great glamorous city in Scotland; how her parents sternly opposed this
intention, but in the end, without their consent, she bought a passage
with her savings and at last boarded the mail steamer with a friend,
Katie, who was returning from a holiday at home to a post as chamber-
maid in a hotel in Aberdeen; how the two slept on deck under a
tarpaulin, but were drenched by a wave; how the friend secured her a
place as scullery-maid; how she marvelled at the city of grey granite,
feeling that at last she was in the great world; how nevertheless she
often found herself longing for the voes and the crofts and the
Shetland speech, and her still dear family; how she was torn between
love and contempt for the old life, between fascination and vague
disgust with the city; how in due season she became a waitress in the
same hotel and, in spite of her ugliness, was a success, not merely
through efficiency but because of her knack of pleasing people of very
different sorts; how she spent her free time mostly on solitary walks
in the country or the town itself, watching its life; how her ugliness
was a protection against unwanted attentions, but also a barrier
between her and the boys; how she occasionally went with Katie to see
the thrilling new moving pictures of life in New York or Monte Carlo;
how Katie had a succession of love affairs, but she herself was merely
everybody's dear sister; how, still seeking fullness of life, she
presently moved on to posts in Glasgow, and then to the North of
England and her present job; how her ambition was to reach London.</p>

<p>While Maggie was happily telling Victor about her life, the
afternoon had advanced into evening. The trees in front of them were
silhouetted against a golden sky. The two sat closer together, and
Victor had allowed himself to slip his arm under hers, and to hold her
hand. She responded with gentle pressure, but said, "We may as well be
friendly, even if I'm not going to take you on."</p>

<p>Victor told me that he had been wondering how it was that a girl who
had missed her due of admiration from young men could be so detached
and even guarded against his own cautious advances. Intuitively he felt
that sex was somehow repugnant to her; and yet, according to her own
account, she had regretted her exclusion from normal love-
experiences.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" he said. "Even though most young men were too blind to
see your beauty, surely some must have wanted you? You don't behave at
all like--like a plain girl who is always longing to be loved." She did
not answer. He felt her go rigid. Her face was turned away from
him.</p>

<p>Presently she turned toward him, and seemed to study his face in the
fading light. Then she said, "Inquisitive, aren't you? Why should I
have to tell you all about myself? But you're sort of understanding,
like my brother Tom, who was drowned."</p>

<p>Then she suddenly disengaged herself and rose, saying that it was
getting late, and they mustn't miss the bus. He did not press her to
say more. When he had paid for the meal, they walked down the garden,
and he held the gate open for her. As she passed through, the evening
light lent mystery to her face. "You are lovely to look at," he said,
"but that is not all. There is something strange about you. I think you
must be a witch. Do you see the future, or stick pins in waxen images
of your enemies, or put potions in people's beer? Or do you just cast
spells on them by giving them waking-dreams of your face?" She was
startled, thinking of Great-Aunt Abigail's now almost forgotten
declaration. But she said, rather sharply, "I don't believe in such
things. I'm modern. I should like to go in a submarine or fly an
aeroplane, or be a great surgeon. I believe in science. I'm bored with
the old dope about witches and magic and second sight." He said, "Then
what about my dreams of you?"</p>

<p>She answered, "Oh, that's your affair. Probably you are just kidding
yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Modern," he said, "you must have had lots of lovers.
Tell me about them!"</p>

<p>She answered only, "Nosing again!" And when he attempted to take her
arm, she gently freed herself. But as they walked unlinked down the
dark road, under trees, she said, "Oh, well. Perhaps I shall tell you
some day."</p>

<p>She did; at a much later date, when she had come to know him much
better. And Victor, sitting; with me in the hotel lounge, told me
vaguely that she had indeed, as he suspected, "encountered the seamy
side of sex", and been "severely wounded by her experiences". Not till
long afterwards did I learn from Maggie herself the details of this
unhappy side of it' her life. But I had better give some account of
them now, since without some knowledge of them the reader would be
unable to understand the course of her early relations with Victor.</p>

<p>During her time in Aberdeen she suffered increasingly from the sense
of inability to attract men, and from her privation of all the normal
dalliance and "walking out" which meant so much to her friend Katie.
Moreover, her longing to be "modern", and to have all kinds of "modern"
and "emancipated" experiences, disposed her to a freedom and even
licentiousness that was still rare in those days before the First World
War. So when she found that some men would, with a little
encouragement, make advances to her, she was very ready to accept them.
But the men who took notice of her were all of the kind that Katie
condemned as riff-raff or "wrong 'uns". Maggie, however, was ready to
believe that they were the sensitive ones who could see the beauty to
which most men were blind. She chose to ignore her great- aunt's
warning that some of the blind would lyingly praise her. Thus it was
that she stumbled into a very unfortunate affair in the dockside
underworld of Aberdeen. She struck up an acquaintance with some
undesirable creature to whom no decent girl would stoop. His advances
were of the crudest, but he was able to pose to her as an unfortunate
and fundamentally gentle cave-man whom society had maltreated. Maggie
frankly responded, and was ready to see in him virtues which no one
else could see. She allowed him all sorts of liberties with her person.
Gradually and very reluctantly, she discovered that he was not more
sensitive than other men, but more coarse-grained and brutal, that his
crude praise of her looks was quite insincere, that he had come to her
not out of admiration and love but simply in the expectation that such
an ugly girl would be ready to give him what others refused, namely
bodily intercourse. Such a discovery was, of course, bitterly galling.
But such was her hunger for experience and "emancipation" that she
swallowed her shame and allowed herself to be led right up to the point
of going to bed with her "lover". At the last minute violent repugnance
seized her, and she broke from his arms, and began to dress. The man,
of course, was furious, and attempted rape; but Maggie was not one to
give in easily, when loathing had conquered craving. She put up a
spirited fight, and cooled her assailant's ardour by inflicting painful
damage. Thus, battered but victorious, she technically preserved her
virginity.</p>

<p>Some time after she had recovered from the shock of this affair
Maggie became involved with another unattractive specimen of the
opposite sex. But this time disillusionment supervened at an earlier
stage of the relationship, and she dismissed her man before she was
seriously implicated. In spite of these two unfortunate incidents her
passion to be experienced and "modern" forced her to try again and
again. Each time, disgust supervened at an earlier stage than before,
until at last she shrank from the slightest contact with any man.</p>

<p>In Glasgow, where she was barmaid in a low-class hotel, she had an
adventure of a different pattern. She met a Negro. He had a frightful
cough, was probably tubercular, and was desperately lonely. He longed
to get back to West Africa, but he had no money. The girls treated him
like dirt because he was black, broken-down, and simple. He had the
remains of a well-knit and powerful body, and dog's eyes. Out of
compassion, Maggie befriended him, mothered him. He responded with
adoration and great gentleness, never presuming to touch his goddess.
To her surprise she found that when he did accidentally touch her she
was not repelled, He had a sweet nature, she felt, that could never
harbour the brutish lust that was the sole motive of her other lovers.
He treated everyone, even his persecutors, with fundamental respect. He
was ready to accord to everyone the benefit of the doubt. Maggie
gradually conceived a great affection for him. And so, like a queen
condescending to a trusted subject whom she had chosen as a consort,
she gently led him into making love to her. At first he could scarcely
bring himself to commit so small a sacrilege as stroking her hand. But
stage by stage he reached the point of undressing his goddess, with all
the reverence of a priest unveiling the holy of holies. She felt
neither repugnance nor fear, but only a warm glow of affection and
expectation. But then, to her surprise, his trembling hands were
withdrawn from her, and he muttered in a thick husky voice, "I must
not, I must not. There is a devil in me, and he would hurt you." This
declaration only increased Maggie's confidence in him, and her
readiness to give herself to him. She quickly overcame his scruples,
and with an almost religious reverence and gentleness he took her.</p>

<p>The two lived together in very humble quarters, kept by Maggie's
earnings and the intermittent wages that he won from such casual
labouring as he could secure. For a while she was content. But little
by little she became restless and lonely. She craved equal comradeship
and common enterprise. Her Negro, though infinitely patient and gentle,
and in a way personally understanding, was too remote from the "great
world" which had cast its spell on her. "I wanted," she told me, "a man
of my own kind, who would wake me, and--ride me rough-shod to the
stars; who would free something creative in me that had always been
chained up." Such high-falutin language was quite beyond her at the
time; but later, under Victor's half-assimilated influence, this was
how she described her feelings at the close of her adventure with her
Negro. She was beginning to feel that she was losing contact with the
great world, and becoming more and more tangled in responsibility
toward her lover. Further, she was frightened that she might have a
child. Such preventives as she knew were far from reliable. Little by
little, her manner toward him changed. She cooled. Sometimes she would
unintentionally let little spiteful remarks slip from her tongue; and
the effort to comfort the wounded man after these lapses became
increasingly burdensome.</p>

<p>One night she was particularly horrid to him, hinting that he was
not really good enough for her, and that she had only accepted him out
of charity, and that his love-making was too humble. She even forgot
herself so far as to say that it would be too awful if she had the
burden of a little nigger baby. This foolish remark woke something in
him that had been long suppressed. He went savage. It was as though the
spirit of the black race took possession of him to avenge itself upon
the whole race of white tyrants. His eyes flashed, his teeth gleamed in
his dark face. He said, "Right I I'll make love to you in another way.
It's your own fault if you don't like it." Recounting this incident to
me, she said, "Then he went at me like a tiger, tearing off my clothes,
biting and tearing at my flesh, and doing unspeakable things." She
screamed and fought; but presently he sprang away from her, and
collapsed in a heap on the floor, blubbering and begging her pardon.
She, in spite of her fright and the rough handling, was feeling very
guilty herself; and soon she was kneeling over him and comforting him,
with blood on her neck and breasts. In ten minutes they were friends
again, and making tea.</p>

<p>However, on the following day, the Negro, who seems to have been, at
heart a remarkably generous and sensible person, decided that they must
part. He could no longer trust himself with her. It was obvious to
Maggie, too, that she could not trust herself not to torment him. So it
was agreed that they must part. And they parted in style. They spent
all their cash on food and drink for the celebration, prepared a feast
in their cheap room, ate as much as they could manage, toasted one
another, and then the black race and the white race, and the amity of
the two, toasted everything and everybody, got happily sozzled and
sentimental, petted and embraced one another, and finally, to the
surprise of both, fell to serious love-making, and retired to bed
together. Maggie, generous and courageous, was determined that the
previous night's mishap should be, so far as possible, wiped out by
something better. The Negro was equally anxious to make amends for his
past obsequiousness and for his recent brutality. The sense of her
danger and of their imminent parting exalted Maggie to respond to him
with a new fervour; and her warmth in turn had a tonic effect on him,
so that for once he was able to be gentle without being abject, and
ardent without being brutal. They slept in peace together; and next
morning they parted.</p>

<p>For Maggie, the upshot was that, having at last copiously tasted the
forbidden fruit, and having found it both sweet and bitter, she no
longer craved it for its own sake. She would henceforth be violently
repelled by all sexual contacts that were not patently the vehicle of
true love between equals. For with her Negro she had at least
experinced enough to be able to imagine what sex could be when it was
indeed the expression of full personal love.</p>

<p>Such were the experiences that Maggie refrained from recounting to
Victor as they walked along the dark road, side by side, but unlinked.
He made one more attempt to gain her confidence. He said, "There's
something painful in your memory, and something you're a bit ashamed
of. If you were to trust me, and share the pain, and the shame too, I
might be able to wipe them out for you." She answered, "No! Not yet,
anyhow. You're not my father inquisitor." The odd phrase amused him;
and he wondered, but did not enquire, whether it was deliberate or due
to ignorance. He pressed her no further, but turned the conversation to
more general subjects. In the bus, they sat snugly together, but he
refrained from holding her hand; and for this she was grateful, yet
vaguely disappointed. When the time came to part, he did take her hand.
It was a large and capable hand, and the skin was rather coarse.
Ineradicable dirt was ingrained in the thumb and forefinger. He raised
the hand to his lips, and said, "Think it all over. I'm leaving
tomorrow, but I shall come back soon."</p>

<h2>7 - UNCERTAIN HAPPINESS</h2>

<h4>From 1921 to 1924</h4>

<p>VICTOR TOLD ME that when he had established himself in his job, he
formed a habit of going over to see Maggie every few weeks. They became
increasingly friendly, and their friendship (so Maggie subsequently
told me) opened up new mental horizons for her. She had always been
something of a reader, but her tastes were very undeveloped. Victor
introduced her to contemporary writing; and though at first she found
much of it exasperating, or too difficult, or downright horrid, she
soon, with his help, began to understand what writers like D. H
Lawrence and James Joyce were trying to do. She was driven on by her
prediliction for the modern; but she did not allow herself to be
hypnotized by literary fashion. A fundamental sincerity and common
sense saved her from persuading herself that she appreciated, or even
that she understood, works that were beyond her.</p>

<p>Of T. S. Eliot, she said that it all sounded marvellous, but she
couldn't make head or tail of it. The scientific fantasies and
sociological novels of Wells she could understand, and she read them
with zest, and a sense of mind-stretching; but also, she said, with a
vague feeling that the whole of this "modern wisdom" was somehow
incomplete, perhaps superficial. When Victor introduced her to Freud,
she had reacted first with revulsion, then with an exciting sense of
emancipation, and finally with mingled enthusiasm and suspicion. "I can
see," she told Victor, "that we are more or less what Freud says we
are; but I just can't believe that is all there is to us." It was the
same with Marxism. She could not bring herself to read more than the
Communist Manifesto; but Victor's own account of Marxist theories
fascinated her. It made her realize for the first time the power of
economic conditions over men's minds and actions. But again she had a
nagging suspicion. "It's all terribly clever," she said, "and I suppose
it's true. But--there must be another truth, too, of a different sort.
I mean-people are not just like what he says they are."</p>

<p>Victor also passed on to her in their many talks a great deal of
scrappy scientific and historical information that had never before
come her way; information about human evolution, Mendelian laws of
heredity, pre-history, the new theories of the structure of atoms, the
life-story of stars, and of the great nebulae. Sometimes he overdid it.
He would ramble on, absorbed in his own intellectual interests, so that
she lost the thread, and her attention would wander. Presently she
would break in on his monologue with some bit of frivolity, to bring
him back to earth. Then, she told me, she could feel a momentary shock
pass through his mind; but almost at once he would adjust himself to
her mood. Never was he hurt or superior. Often he was apologetic for
his "prosiness". Latterly, as they became more sensitive to each other,
he would himself break off into lighter talk before she had begun to
tire. As time passed, she became less easily tired, more determined to
worry through to the heart of each subject.</p>

<p>He sometimes put her into a state of fascinated bewilderment by
sketchy references to the new physical theories of relativity and the
quantum. He himself had absorbed a good deal on these subjects in his
scanty spare time, and I have no doubt that he had a gift for
presenting it in a vivid way. Maggie herself, though of course she
could not follow complicated mathematical arguments, was evidently
enthralled by the new picture of the universe that was gradually
presented to her. And the scientific attitude itself seems to have been
very attractive to her. This, she felt, was the real "modern spirit"
that she had always longed to master. Just what she meant by the
"modern spirit" she probably could not have said. She might have called
it common sense and contempt for superstition. Much later she would
have described it as a blend of common sense, daring imagination and
rigorous intellectual integrity. Seeing it through Victor's mind, she
saw it at its best. And with his help, and her own freshness of
approach, she saw also its snares.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this strange "course in modern thought ", that
Victor gave her, was that she came to grasp something of what her
Great-Aunt Abigail had meant when she said that the old wisdom and the
new wisdom were both necessary and each incomplete without the
other.</p>

<p>During this period her relationship with Victor was almost entirely
"platonic", a warm friendship, with the sexual aspect kept well in the
background. Sometimes they walked arm-in-arm or hand-in-hand.
Sometimes, when they said "goodbye", she would allow herself to be
kissed, and he would respond (she said) with thrilling gentleness but
without trace of passion. Little by little she realized that this very
odd kind of courtship was having a deep effect on her. Victor became
the dominant factor in her life, and she looked forward with impatience
to every visit. Moreover, toward him she felt none of that revulsion
against physical contact that she had acquired from her unfortunate
experiences in Scotland. On the contrary, she found herself longing for
greater physical intimacy with Victor.</p>

<p>Yet for many months he remained more like a devoted brother than a
lover. Well on in the second year of their acquaintance she herself
began to make shy advances. She would cling to his hand, lean
enticingly against him, permit herself a new ardour in the parting
kiss. But though he certainly never rebuffed her, he responded always
with affection rather than passion. Once more the bitter suspicion
arose in her mind that he was after all not really physically attracted
by her, even if he was not actually repelled. Bewildered and hurt, she
ceased to try to "make things easy for him", and even went so far as to
adopt a colder manner, and to refuse ostentatiously even the slight
physical contact that he offered. On the rare occasions when he took
her hand, she withdrew it.</p>

<p>I learned from Victor himself, in our conversation in my hotel, that
his policy had been deliberate. At first, suspecting that she had had
unhappy sexual experiences, he determined to win her affection without
making any sexual advances to her. Later a new motive confirmed him in
this policy of refraining from wooing her. Already before the time when
she herself had begun to treat him more warmly, he was becoming
painfully aware that his awake personality was, after all, not as
securely established as he had supposed. And in these circumstances he
felt that he must not take advantage of her new disposition. Indeed, he
even thought of putting an end to his visits. But the trouble was as
yet slight, and he persuaded himself that so drastic a course was not
necessary. (This decision, he confessed to me, was too easily reached,
and therefore itself an indication that he was no longer in his most
fully lucid state.)</p>

<p>He had been seriously overworking, and he was sometimes desperately
tired. At these times he suffered from fierce head-aches, which always
ended in an irresistible "attack of sleepiness". The dread that if he
did sleep he might wake up as "the other" drove him to resist sleep to
the utmost of his power. He would read or write far into the night, and
in the end collapse into heavy sleep in his chair. Several times he
remained in this condition till the afternoon of the following day,
when he awoke cold, frightened, and unrefreshed. The very fact that he
was frightened added to his fright; for when he was really awake he
could regard every kind of danger, even the danger of slipping back
into his old self, with lofty detachment. He noted also that when he
re-examined any work that he had done on the previous evening, it
generally seemed to be of poor quality. His only comfort was that,
tired and distressed as he was, he at no time lost his grip on the true
values. He never reverted to the conventional and snobbish values of
the Dolt.</p>

<p>In consequence of this change of his condition, then, Victor was
determined not to let himself make love to Maggie. He could not
tolerate the thought that she should become entangled with the Dolt. On
the other hand, he felt an increased need for her company. And always,
when he had seen her, he found himself immediately restored to full
clarity of mind. The bracing effect of her presence lasted for several
weeks. But sooner or later the trouble would return. After each attack
he longed uncontrollably for her; and this very passion, he suspected,
was itself evidence that even after the attack had passed, he was not
fully himself. For in his most lucid mood, though he longed with equal
ardour, his detachment, his fundamental dispassion, enabled him to
stand outside his passion and control it. But after an attack, he was
so transported with longing for Maggie, that he had no thought but to
arrange a meeting with her as soon as possible. Until he found himself
actually in her presence he could think of nothing but her, and his own
desperate need of her. Yet, strangely, as soon as he reached her, the
fog vanished from his mind, and he was completely self-possessed.
Though indeed he longed to hold her closely to him and kiss her with
ardour, he was entirely capable of treating her with the usual calm
friendliness. To do more than this, he felt, would be utterly base.</p>

<p>When Maggie began to make it obvious that warmer treatment would be
acceptable, the effect was to make Victor realize even more clearly
that it would be unfair to respond. But he was in a dilemma. Things had
by now gone too far. If he were to tell her frankly that his grip on
himself was weakening, and that he must therefore keep away from her,
she might well (since she was of a generous and courageous nature) give
herself to him when he was recovering from an attack and unable to
control his passion for her.</p>

<p>Another policy suggested itself. He might deliberately give her the
impression that he no longer loved her, and so compel her to free
herself. But again, he knew that after each attack he would vitiate
this plan by clamouring for her. Moreover, he found, to his own
surprise, that to deny his love for her was somehow morally repugnant
to him. Vaguely he felt that it would be a violation of something more
important even than Maggie's happiness. The thing that he had hoped
for, their spiritual unity (as he called it) had already been conceived
in their deepening friendship. To destroy this by acting a lie to her,
even for her own individual comfort, would be murder of something
spiritually vital. Besides, he told himself, even from the point of
view of her individual happiness, this ruthless policy would not really
succeed. Already she was deeply dependent on him. To break with her
would be not merely to inflict on her a period of sharp distress but
also to make her feel for ever after that love, even in its fullest
expression, was after all open to decay. Such a feeling, coming on top
of her past unhappy experiences, might well turn her into an embittered
cynic.</p>

<p>Victor spent much of his precious time with Maggie brooding on his
dilemma; and this absorption no doubt increased her impression of his
aloofness.</p>

<p>The crisis came after a particularly bad attack. He woke from his
heavy sleep late in the afternoon; too late to catch the train to an
outlying town where he was due to take one of his weekly classes. He
woke in a state of overwhelming depression. He was conscious, too,
while he was lying between sleep and waking, of a definite revulsion
against his whole present life and all his interests. He felt a vague,
guilty nostalgia for his former circumstances. Realizing the
significance of this little experience, he sprang from his bed in
terror that his lucid personality was at last being submerged. But he
was still more or less himself; though distraught, and so not himself
at his best.</p>

<p>He took a cold bath, dressed, shaved, asked his motherly landlady to
give him a meal, and telephoned to the university to say that he was
ill and could not keep his appointment. After his meal he wrote a long
and emotional letter to Maggie, explaining his past coolness and his
present plight, and imploring her to save him and herself by coming to
live with him. He also said that he would visit her in a couple of days
(on her next free afternoon), so that they could talk the whole matter
over and make the necessary arrangements. He ended with passionate
endearments, and the statement, "I need you desperately; and you, me.
If you come to me, you may suffer terribly, but you will live."</p>

<p>The receipt of this letter naturally threw Maggie into a state of
violent agitation. It was no use to write to him, as he would have left
his lodgings before the letter could reach him. When he arrived, she
was waiting for him in the little crowd at the exit from the platform.
He dropped his bag, seized her in his arms, and pressed his lips
hungrily to hers. She responded without reserve, and broke down in
tears. The crowd tried not to watch them. It was Victor who disengaged
himself, with a heavy sigh. They walked off arm-in-arm, with her hand
clinging to his. "Oh, why, why," she said, "didn't you tell me about it
long ago?" By now Victor had regained full clarity, and was deeply
regretting his letter. After a silence, he said, "You must forget all
that I wrote to you. At least you must ignore it. I was not myself. I
was grossly exaggerating. Now that I am with you, I am properly awake
again, and I see how silly I was. The letter simply wasn't written by
me, but by some sort of sleepy half-me. In the train I was longing,
longing to have you, and I didn't care how bad it would be for you. But
now I see that I mustn't drag you down with me. And I mustn't win you
by appealing for your pity. No, the whole thing makes me squirm, now."
She was protesting. "No! no! You have got it all wrong. You must let me
come to you and help you. My life is meaningless without you." But he
insisted that he must fight his own battle, and that he would win
through; and that when he was quite right again, he would come back to
her, and ask her to marry him, and she would be able to choose freely.
She replied that she had already made up her mind to join with him. She
added, "And don't you see, the harm is done. We are far too tangled up
together for me to live without you, whatever happens. I shall come
right away with you now, and stick to you through everything." He said
he could not possibly risk her finding herself married to the Dolt.
"But, my dear," she said, "we needn't get married. We are married at
heart now. We'll fix things with the law later, when we have won
through, and children are coming." But Victor was immovable. "I should
never forgive myself," he said, "and my shame would spoil everything
for us."</p>

<p>Maggie tried a new line. She said, "You are simply too proud. I
don't believe you do really love me, after all. If you did, you would
be glad to let me help you. You love your proud self more than me. You
want to let me stay stranded and miserable and useless, just so that
you can prove that you don't depend on anybody. The Victor that I love
is not the proud one but the one that cried to me for help." This
remark shook him. But he said, "It's not myself that I love better than
you; it's--well it's--O God, I don't know! It's something not me and
yet in me, using me; something I must be true to at all costs, 'I could
not love thee, dear, so much, loved I not honour more.' But it's not
honour merely. It's--some would say 'God' but I don't know anything
about God. It's--well, the spirit. I must not sin against the spirit.
And you mustn't want me to."</p>

<p>This conversation was carried on in undertones as they sat with
their heads together in the bus that was taking them out to their usual
haunts. On the walk itself he tried in vain to lead her off into
impersonal matters, but she kept reverting to their problem. Before
they parted he promised that he would be more careful not to overtire
himself, and he explained that he was going to practise a "new
technique of mental discipline" which he felt sure would strengthen
him. He added, "You have strengthened me immensely today. Now that I
know you know all about it, I feel I shall never slip again." But she
clung to his hand, and wailed, "I want to help, I do so want to help by
being with you always." She made him promise that if he felt that he
was not succeeding with his task, he would tell her, and let her come
to him at once, before the danger threatened too seriously. He readily
promised, and pointed out that in the confused state after an attack he
apparently could not help rushing to her. And then, looking into her
strange slate-and-russet eyes, he said, "Powerful witch! You had cast
your spell on me even before I met you. I think, too, that it was your
magic that saved me when I so nearly tied myself to Edith. It was the
sight of you at breakfast that did the trick, repulsive creature though
you seemed to me then. And it is your magic that jerks me fully awake
when I meet you after my attacks." He kissed her hand, and added, "But
remember, you must keep your magic off me for a bit, till I have
regained my self-respect." She agreed, but with misgiving.</p>

<p>During this little speech, Maggie had thought of her great-aunt's
never wholly forgotten prophecy. She wondered.</p>

<p>All she said was, but with the tenderest smile (so he told me),
"Proud, selfish man! You don't really know what love is. I do. Once I
didn't, but now I do. You taught me; and yet you don't really know,
yourself. If you really, really loved me, you wouldn't stand on your
dignity. You'd just say, 'Look! We are in for a bad time together, but
we'll win through together. And even if we don't, its' together we must
face the disaster'." But he replied, "No, my dear, you don't
understand. When I first saw you, we met as equals. I did not know how
weak I was. But now--I know I'm morally sick, and I must conquer the
devil in me with my own strength before I can meet you as an equal once
more." To this she replied, "My father used to tell us that man could
never save himself with his own strength alone. If he could, my father
said, it would be bad for him, because it would make him proud; and so,
after all, he would be damned. Father used to say it was Christ's work
alone to save us." Victor thought for a moment, before saying, "I do
see that there's important truth in the old view. I can only be saved
by something other than just me; but by something universal, not by
another person, not even by you and your magic. Only the spirit itself
can save me; and only by simply revealing itself to me more
commandingly."</p>

<p>It was time to part. Lowering his face toward her, he said, "One
kiss might be allowed the patient, don't you think?" Their lips met.
She said, "I shall pray for you. I don't think I believe in God, but I
must pray for you." He smiled, and stepped into the train.</p>

<p>Victor went back to his work greatly refreshed and strengthened. For
a month or so, in fact till the end of the winter, all went well. He
wrote to her often, and welcomed her letters; but he did not go to see
her. He was careful not to overstrain himself, and he pursued his
"unorthodox spiritual discipline", by which he hoped to banish "the
Dolt" into the dungeon of his unconscious for ever. He did not tell me
much about this new technique, beyond saying that it involved
concentrating his attention on the "spirit" at frequent intervals
throughout the day, and practising certain spiritual exercises every
night before going to bed, and while he was falling asleep. He gave up
the policy of resisting sleep. On the contrary, he allowed himself as
much as he wanted, which in his lucid state was seldom more than four
hours, and generally much less. He told Maggie that the attacks had
ceased, that he hoped to be secure in a couple of months, and that he
was longing to see her.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the stream of his brief letters ended. She continued
to write to him, imploring him for news; but vainly.</p>

<h2>8 - A DISTRESSING INTERLUDE</h2>

<h4>From 1923 to 1924</h4>

<p>ALL THIS WHILE, it seems, Maggie had kept her promise not to "use
her witchcraft on him". It was an easy promise, for she had no idea how
she could break it. But with a view to the possibility that later she
might have to exercise whatever powers she had (if indeed she had any),
she set about exploring and experimenting. She was handicapped by
complete ignorance, and a vague revulsion against the whole matter. For
years she had been leaning more and more toward common sense,
matter-of-factness, natural science. Apart from shadowy memories of her
great-aunt's stones, and of her own doubtful paranormal experiences in
early youth, and the obviously quite uncritical beliefs of some of her
acquaintances, she had no reason to believe in "the occult ".</p>

<p>She began to attend some sort of spiritualist seance that was held
weekly in her neighbourhood. She tried to test the medium by asking for
an interview with her dead brother. The results were not completely
negative, but far too ambiguous to satisfy Maggie's shrewd
intelligence. On the other hand, she could not help being impressed by
the fact that the medium at once treated her as a colleague, and told
her that she must "learn quickly to use her powers, or it would be too
late". But each week she became more violently hostile to the emotional
atmosphere of the seances. Had she attended the meetings in her early
impressionable period, under the influence of her great- aunt, she
might well have accepted without question these all-too- human
communications from the dead, these carefully ambiguous prophecies,
these bits of platitudinous advice given to simple souls in the grip of
real heart-rending conflicts, or misfortunes. On the other hand, had
she encountered "spiritualism" in the stage when she was reacting
strongly against the old ways and values, she would have scornfully
dismissed the whole matter as trickery. But now, under the influence of
Victor's cautious criticism alike of the old and the new superstitions,
and moreover stirred by the mystery of her relation with him, she was
unable either to accept or reject, but was forced to remain in painful
doubt. Something real and out of the ordinary, she felt, was indeed
sometimes at work in the seances; but far more often nothing happened
that could not plausibly be explained as a combination of coincidence
and deception.</p>

<p>On one occasion tile medium gave a display of "psychometry". A
sitter would hand her some personal article such as a glove or scarf or
watch, and after fingering it for a while she would make pronouncements
abut the character or circumstances of the owner. Maggie produced a
pencil that Victor had formerly carried in his pocket. The medium
handled it in silence for some time; then, in a voice no longer
luscious and soothing but staccato and uneasy, she said, "There's
something queer about this, something that goes beyond my powers.
There's someone who is--well more than human, more than ordinary-human;
but-torn apart, somehow. He needs help. But he's proud. Help him at
once, even if he's too proud." She paused, then hastily returned the
pencil, saying. "Take it! I'm frightened." Naturally Maggie was
impressed by this reaction; and alarmed by the advice. But later,
during a very emotional scene in which "ectoplasm" was supposed to have
issued from the medium's mouth. Maggie had an access of revulsion and
scepticism. Several of the company were profoundly impressed, and in a
state verging on hysterics. Maggie, on a sudden impulse, reached out
and snatched the "ectoplasm ". which turned out to be a piece of crepe.
There was an uproar. The medium angrily maintained that the "young
witch" had used her powers to change the genuine ectoplasm into a
seeming piece of crepe, and that she herself was gravely damaged by the
loss of part of her psychical anatomy. She then screamed, and fell into
a coma. So at least most of the group believed. But Maggie was
convinced that she was shamming, and watching all the while under
lowered eyelids. Maggie ceased to attend the meetings.</p>

<p>But she was undertaking experiments of her own. In the hotel dining-
room, when she was standing waiting while the residents finished a
course, she would concentrate her attention on one of them, and try to
will him (or her) to turn and look at her, or to sneeze, or show a
change of mood. Occasionally she seemed to have a striking success; but
generally nothing happened. She could not exclude the possibility that
her seeming successes were illusory.</p>

<p>One of the residents was a sad and taciturn old lady. Maggie
determined to make her talk to people and enjoy life. After a week or
so of concentration on her "patient ", Maggie was delighted to see the
ancient dame looking about her at her fellow guests with a bright and
interested expression. Next day she actually opened a conversation with
a young woman who sat alone at the next table. She seemed to have
pleased the girl, for henceforth they shared a table, and were at no
loss for conversation. This remarkable change in the old lady went far
to convince Maggie that she had indeed supernormal powers. But her
conviction was shaken when she overheard "her patient" remark to the
younger woman that her doctor's new medicine seemed to have worked a
miraculous cure of the indigestion that had overclouded her life for
twenty years.</p>

<p>Another of the residents was a morose man well advanced in middle
age, who drank far too much, and indeed seemed to have nothing else to
do. Mindful of Victor, Maggie considered him a very suitable subject
for experiment; for he was obviously, as she put it to herself, "a
decent sort gone wrong". Her general aim was to find some way of
"waking" people to what Victor would have called the most lucid and
sensitive range of consciousness possible to them. If she could learn
this art, she would be equipped to help Victor to keep the Dolt at bay
for ever.</p>

<p>She had no certainty that she had any powers at all; but if she had,
they seemed to consist at bottom in the power to direct the "patient's"
attention to something within the range of his vision but persistently
ignored.</p>

<p>She began her new experiment by trying to make her man notice things
in the room; the sunlight falling on a vase of daffodils, the sleek
dignity of the hotel cat as it paced across the floor, the man-to-man
relations of a mother and her small boy at a neighbouring table, the
crisply rippling patter of two French voices at the far end of the
room, the far from obvious expression of saintliness that sometimes
interfered with the sophisticated manner of the young woman at the old
lady's table. After some days she was inclined to think that she was
having a certain amount of success. She now tried to direct her
"patient's" attention to the opinion that the other residents had of
him, carefully selecting those who did not loathe or despise him but
were grieved that a man who must formerly have been well-set-up and
attractive should have gone to pieces. After a few days she thought he
was spending less time in the bar. Then he gave up alcohol entirely.
Maggie was convinced that her experiment was succeeding. Then one day
as she was about to enter the lounge to attend to the fire, she heard
her "patient" within the room earnestly saying, to someone unseen, "By
simply being yourself, you have saved me. If you won't accept me, I
shall go to pieces again." Maggie stood to listen. The voice of the
sophisticated young woman replied, "I tell you it's no good, I hardly
know you. I don't intend to marry you for your money, and I didn't save
you. You must have saved yourself. Please let me go!" There was a sound
as of a slight scuffle, and Maggie hastily retired. Later, as she was
serving at dinner she overheard a snatch of conversation between the
young woman and her aged friend. "I merely smiled at him, no more; and
now I am supposed to be his guardian angel."</p>

<p>The upshot of this experiment, like the others, was that Maggie was
still uncertain whether she really had "magical" powers; but on the
whole she was sufficiently encouraged to pursue her experiments. It
even seemed that she was working in the right direction for their
development as a means of helping Victor.</p>

<p>When it was clear that the flow of letters from Victor had ceased,
she felt that she was absolved from her promise to refrain from
influencing him, and she applied such technique as she had acquired to
the task of strengthening the lucid Victor against his somnolent other
self. But this was a far more formidable venture than any of her
experiments, since Victor was at a distance. And she had no means of
knowing how, if at all, he was responding. On the whole, she felt that
the most hopeful method was to transmit to Victor clear images of her
own face, and memories of their most stimulating conversations. With
this end in view she used to steal moments to gaze at herself in a
mirror, so that she might have as precise an image as possible to send
to Victor.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she was becoming more and more anxious and impatient. At
last she decided to go over to Victor's town and make enquiries at his
address, well aware that by doing so she might compromise both herself
and Victor. What she learned from Victor's landlady was very
disturbing.</p>

<p>I will tell the story as I was told it by Victor himself in our
London hotel. After his last visit to Maggie, he had no further
attacks. He conscientiously practised his new "discipline" and avoided
overstrain. As time passed, he became confident that he was once more
firmly established, and little by little he turned less careful. At the
end of the session he attended a "social" organized by the students in
a distant town. On this occasion, in order to enter into the spirit of
the party, he allowed himself a dispensation from his temporary total
abstinence from alcohol, and he drank a fair amount of beer. I have
already mentioned that in his awake state he was little affected by
alcohol. On this occasion, however, he noticed a slight dizziness. He
therefore refused any more drinks. It is not clear whether the disaster
was brought on by alcohol or by the fact that on the journey home in
the train a heavy suitcase fell from the rack above him on to his head,
and for a moment he was stunned. He arrived in his lodgings very tired,
and with a splitting headache. He went straight to bed.</p>

<p>Next day he awoke as "the Dolt". He had therefore no recollection of
events since he stood at the altar to be married to Edith two years
earlier. He woke in broad daylight and in a completely unknown and
rather cheap little bedroom. Under the pillow he found his own wrist-
watch. It registered 10.20. He sprang out of bed, bewildered, and with
a throbbing head. On a chair were clothes, some of which he recognized.
On the dressing table was some loose cash, a wallet, pen, pencil, and
so on, most of which he recognized. He put on his familiar dressing
gown, which was far shabbier than he had supposed it, and opened the
door, which led into an obviously "lodging-house" sitting- room. The
fire in the grate had been recently fed. The table was laid for
breakfast for one, but had not been used. A newspaper lay folded on the
plate. It was the Manchester Guardian, a very wrong-headed paper from
the Dolt's point of view. Victor glanced at the date, February 24th,
1923. He subsided in an easy chair, feeling sick and frightened.</p>

<p>On the opposite chair was a pile of books and papers. He reached out
for some of these. The books were mostly inscribed "Victor Smith" (not
Cadogan-Smith), and were dry tomes on industrial history. The papers
were written in a handwriting that was presumably his own, but there
was something strange about it. Though neater and more legible, it
struck him as less impressive than his own dashing hand.</p>

<p>Casting the papers aside, he opened the other door of the sitting-
room, in search of the lavatory and bathroom. After a hasty wash and
shave, he went back to his bedroom to dress, then returned to sit by
the fire and consider his position. Taking out his wallet, he found in
it two pound notes and an opened letter addressed in a careful but
unformed hand to "Victor Smith" (not even Mr.), c/o Mrs. Wheelwright,
at an address in a Yorkshire provincial town. Inside were a letter and
a photograph of a remarkably ugly girl whom he recognized as one of the
waitresses at the hotel where he had stayed for his wedding. The letter
began "Dearest Victor", and continued in the same strain, with many
references to someone called "The Dolt", against whom the writer,
"Maggie", wanted to help Victor in some mysterious way. Victor felt an
irrationally violent surge of hostility to the girl. He threw letter
and photograph into the fire.</p>

<p>By the mantelpiece there was a bell-push. Victor pressed it. After a
while a smiling, motherly, middle-aged woman appeared. She said,
"Good-morning, Mr. Smith! You have had a good lie-in!" Then she noticed
something unusual about her lodger. In a rather affected voice, very
unlike the voice she knew as Victor's (so she told Maggie), he demanded
his breakfast. This was a shock to Mrs. Wheelwright, for it had been
his habit to go downstairs and talk to his good friend and landlady
while she cooked his bacon. Bewildered, she stood silent for a moment.
Victor added coldly, "As soon as possible, please." She left him.</p>

<p>Continuing his exploration of the room, he found a cheque-book, a
bank passbook (showing a balance of some forty pounds), several folios
of neat notes on economics and industrial history, a file of
correspondence, mostly about adult educational arrangements, and a
small collection of letters from Maggie. These he read through with
increasing disgust and horror. In one of them Maggie told the story of
her relations with low-class men in Aberdeen, and ended with an account
of her adventures with her Negro lover. When the Dolt had finished
reading the whole bundle, he flung them into the fire and stabbed at
them with the poker till all were safely burnt. This act of
self-emancipation gave him (so the awakened Victor told me during our
long talk in the hotel) an extravagant vindictive satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheelwright returned with the breakfast. He announced that he
would be leaving during the afternoon, and asked for his bill. She
expressed surprise that he was starting on his holiday so soon. He said
he was leaving for good. She was distressed, and said, "But you have
always seemed so happy here. And you know how I love having you. You
are like a son, more than a lodger." Tears were in her eyes, and she
approached to put a hand on his shoulder, saying, "Please, tell me
what's the matter." He shrank away from her, and said merely, "I am
changing my work, and leaving this town. The bill, please." She left
him. Over breakfast he looked up trains to his father's home. When his
meal was done he piled all the notes and correspondence together. Mrs.
Wheelwright brought the bill. He wrote a cheque, and made no offer to
pay her I anything additional on account of leaving without notice. She
did not mention the matter, being more concerned with their personal
than their financial relations. He told her to burn the lecture notes
and correspondence, and dispose of the books as she thought fit. He
then went in search of his bank and drew out all that would remain of
his balance after the payment of Mrs. Wheelwright's bill. Returning to
his lodgings, he packed his possessions in two large suitcases that he
found under the bed, telephoned for a taxi, gave his tearful landlady a
perfunctory "goodbye", and left for the station.</p>

<p>My account of Sir Geoffrey's dealings with his son at this time is
based partly on a long conversation with the old gentleman himself in
the following year, while I was still in France. Knowing my admiration
for, and intimacy with, his son, he asked me to meet him in Paris when
he was on his way through to the Riviera. I gave him all the help I
could in his effort to understand Victor's case; and in return he told
me, with considerable emotion, about the happenings which I am about to
relate. I was surprised to find him so ready to help. As I shall tell
in due course, he had come to feel a sharp conflict of loyalties in his
own heart over the two antagonistic personalities of his son. Evidently
it was a relief to him to unburden himself.</p>

<p>At the time when "the Dolt" suddenly appeared at Sir Geoffrey's
country house, the father had long ago overcome the indignation which
he had felt over his son's marriage fiasco, and he had several times
written to Victor to persuade him to come back and start a new business
career. But the awake Victor had always firmly though amiably refused,
declaring that he must, for a while at least, make a complete break
with his past. He never told his father that he regarded his former
self as not himself at all.</p>

<p>But now at last Victor had come of his own accord. He was obviously
in a state of great distress and confusion. He at once told his father
that he had lost all memory of the events that had happened since he
stood at the altar for marriage. When his father told him of his
outrageous conduct, and that he had not married Edith after all, he was
overwhelmed with mortification. The consequent ruin of his business
career deemed to distress him far more than the harm he had done to
Edith.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey suggested that his son ought to have medical attention,
but Victor was violently opposed to "getting into the clutches of the
doctors". It was decided that for a while he should remain quietly at
home to rest and consider his plans. Sir Geoffrey was much distressed
by his son's distress; and at the same time relieved to learn that
Victor's disgraceful conduct had been due to definite mental
aberration. He was eager to believe that the young man's other
personality must be no more than a perverted and crippled part of his
"true self". How otherwise could he have treated Edith so shamefully,
and sacrifice his own career just when he was finding his feet? How
otherwise could he have got himself entangled with a waitress, and
moreover with one who, so Victor affirmed, was so plain, uneducated,
and coarse-grained. The Dolt had at first intended to keep silent about
this disreputable business, but in the end he had been unable to
refrain from seeking his father's sympathy and advice. In former days
he had seldom taken his father into his confidence, but in his present
suffering he seemed to long to pour out his woes.</p>

<p>It was through this new talkativeness that he first made Sir
Geoffrey wonder whether the Victor whom he had known in the past, and
had now with him, was quite such an admirable person as he had formerly
supposed. Evidently in the old days the son had successfully maintained
a mask such as his father could respect; though even then Sir Geoffrey
had sometimes felt disturbed by Victor's ruthless "realism" in dealings
with persons less fortunate than himself. Now, the harsh snobbery and
careerism of the boy was becoming painfully obvious. His father was
eager to excuse this as an exaggerated revulsion from the other
personality; but he did seriously begin to wonder which of his "two
sons" was in fact the more developed and integrated person.</p>

<p>In the end Sir Geoffrey decided on two actions. He would privately
consult a personal friend who was a distinguished psychiatrist, telling
him all that he knew of Victor's case, and arranging for his friend to
meet Victor casually and "accidentally", so as to be able to study the
unhappy young man without betraying the fact that he was doing so.</p>

<p>In addition, Sir Geoffrey decided to make some discreet
investigations about the doings of the other personality during the
previous three years. He wrote to the Extramural Department of the
university under which Victor had worked, saying that his son had come
home suffering from a serious mental breakdown, and requesting, for
medical purposes, an account of his recent life, and the opinion of his
employers about him. Did he, for instance, ever show signs of mental
disorder? Sir Geoffrey received a prompt reply, to the effect that
Victor's disappearance had surprised and distressed all who knew him,
and that he was an able scholar and a brilliant teacher universally
admired and liked. The letter continued, "Far from showing signs of
mental disorder, he struck us as thoroughly sane. No doubt some of his
opinions were novel and daring, but as a person he was always
completely reliable and capable of shrewd judgment about individuals.
His, obviously, is a very original mind, and he has an extraordinary
gift of sympathetic insight into the minds of others. If all goes well,
he should some day make an outstanding contribution to social thought."
Enclosed was a cheque for Victor's services during the recent session.
This, it was explained, had been returned from his lodgings, which he
had left without giving an address.</p>

<p>Pursuing his researches, Sir Geoffrey contrived to visit Victor's
recent landlady, of course without telling the young man himself. Mrs.
Wheelwright was overawed by the well-dressed, and slightly pompous
visitor, who introduced himself with a visiting card inscribed "Sir
Geoffrey Cadogan-Smith". But the two had a common interest in Victor;
and she was soon unburdening her heart of warm feelings and anxiety on
behalf of her lodger, who, she said, had been more like a son to her.
He gave her no trouble, he helped her with odd jobs in the house, he
nursed her and cooked for her when she was down with 'flu, he had a way
of making her feel "wanted", and often she found herself talking freely
to him about her private affairs, including her great tragedy, the loss
of her husband and only son in the recent war. She assured Sir Geoffrey
that "he was one in a thousand, was my Mr. Smith". Sir Geoffrey made
discreet enquiries about Victor's relations with a certain young woman.
But on this subject she could not or would not help him. She said
merely that Victor had spoken of a young lady whom he hoped to marry
some day, but he must not do so until he was sure he was good enough
for her. He had shown her the girl's photograph. A strange-looking
young lady, not a beauty, but she might be very good- hearted. Probably
she was not really half good enough for Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey was too much of an aristocrat (or would-be aristocrat)
not to feel that his son's hob-nobbing with persons of the lower orders
was a mistake. It sprang from sentimental idealism, and was probably a
morbid reaction against the snobbery of the other Victor. All the same
the father could not help being impressed by the way in which his
"unknown son" had won people's hearts.</p>

<p>Hoping for some further insight into Victor's mind, he said he would
take a glance at his son's books. As he was casting his eyes over the
shelves, he was disturbed to notice, along with the solid works on
economics and history, which were the tools of Victor's trade, a number
of socialistic and even Marxist tracts. There were also works on
psychology by that dirty-minded fellow, Freud, who was becoming
fashionable; also a few volumes on the new mind-twisting theory of
relativity; and a sprinkling of modern poetry, which, Sir Geoffrey
felt, was going badly astray.</p>

<p>While Sir Geoffrey was poking about among his son's books, Mrs.
Wheelwright had continued prattling on about Victor. But presently she
made a statement that attracted her visitor's attention. On the day of
his departure Victor had told her to burn all his notes, but she had
not been able to bring herself to do so. She had stored them in her own
room. Perhaps it would be a breach of confidence to let the father see
the son's private papers; but perhaps, for her lodger's own sake, she
ought to show them, in case they threw any light on his "trouble". Sir
Geoffrey urged her to let him take them away to study at leisure; but
this she firmly refused to allow. Finally it was agreed that he should
stay on for a few hours to study them in her house. She gladly provided
Sir Geoffrey with a meal, and left him to himself.</p>

<p>Most of the notes which she entrusted to him were material for
lectures, quite unexceptionable from Sir Geoffrey's point of view, save
for a general tendency to argue that throughout history the rich had
given the poor a raw deal, and that this, would continue until the
control of "the major means of production" was in the hands of the
representatives of the people. But there was also a crowded notebook
which was obviously the first draft of a book in which Victor was
attempting to state his whole philosophy of life. Sir Geoffrey was soon
deeply absorbed in this. Much struck him as wild and dangerous stuff,
much he sadly recognized, was simply beyond him, parts expressed with
great clarity ideas that he and his generation had been vainly trying
to formulate. Gradually it was borne in on the father that, however
wrong-headed and revolutionary his "unknown son" might be in some
respects, his was indeed a very original mind. Sir Geoffrey even began
to entertain the possibility that, when they differed, the son might
not always be in the wrong. But no! The boy was still young and
extravagant; also, perhaps, unbalanced owing to his mental disorder.
Sir Geoffrey came to a passage of veiled autobiography stating that
each of us is really two men, a dolt and a being of sensibility and
intelligence. There followed a very moving account of the struggle
between the two. Suddenly the father became painfully conscious of the
fact that he was prying. Reluctantly he closed the notebook, summoned
Mrs. Wheelwright and gave all the manuscripts back into her charge.</p>

<p>Before he left, the landlady showed him a treasured photograph of
her recent lodger. Sir Geoffrey was struck both by the likeness to his
known son, and to certain differences. The eyes were alert and smiling,
the mouth fuller yet firmer. Sir Geoffrey looked long at the
photograph, then handed it back in silence.</p>

<p>On the journey home he had much to occupy his mind. His researches
had gone far to confirm his suspicion that his other, unknown son, was
indeed a completer man than the son to whom he was now returning. What
then ought he to do, or rather, try to do? It was all too likely that
he could do nothing. Then what, at any rate, should he hope for? Should
he desire the re-establishment of his familiar Victor, of whom in the
past he had often been proud on account of his successes and his rather
stereotyped brilliance; and for whom, in spite of misgivings, he
still-retained a strong paternal affection? Or should he hope for the
final annihilation of the familiar Victor for the sake of that other
Victor, whom he did not know, and had never even met; that eccentric,
remarkable, rather wrong-headed and dangerous but warm-hearted,
creative intelligence? Or should he perhaps rather look for some sort
of integration of the two Victors in one complete individual? On the
whole his intellect affirmed that the familiar Victor was by now, at
any rate, a poor creature, and the other an outstanding personality.
But to his paternal heart the familiar though no longer respected son
remained irrationally dearer than the brilliant stranger. To work for
the familiar son's annihilation seemed like murder.</p>

<p>When Sir Geoffrey met his son at home, he was oppressed by the
contrast with Mrs. Wheelwright's photograph of the other son. The
sagging eyelids, the drooping ends of the mouth, gave an impression of
humourless self-concern. The father reminded himself that this morbid
condition was, of course, exaggerated by the boy's present unhappy
state. His conversation, too, contrasted unfavourably with the other's
manuscript which Sir Geoffrey had so recently been reading. The present
Victor seemed to be obsessed with anxiety to wriggle back into his
former post. Could his father pull wires for him? After all, he argued,
in spite of aberrations his record had not been undistinguished. And
what about Edith? Was there any chance that she would forgive him and
marry him after all? When he learned that Edith was already married he
was distressed, but not broken-hearted. Indeed, to his father's shame
he was soon making enquiries about other eligible girls.</p>

<p>When Sir Geoffrey suggested that he had better not worry over
marriage till he was cured of his illness, Victor replied with some
warmth, "But don't you see! I must get myself legally tied to some
decent girl as soon as possible. If I go sick again, I may marry that
awful slut. But if I am already legally tied to another, the second
marriage will be invalid." Sir Geoffrey was shocked by this heartless
remark. He protested that it was a low trick to marry a girl simply to
render a subsequent marriage bigamous. Victor hastily added that of
course he was assuming that he would find a girl whom he really loved.
Sir Geoffrey could not help contrasting the present Victor's attitude
with the other's scruples about marrying Maggie.</p>

<p>In due course Sir Geoffrey's psychiatrist friend turned up, and
contrived to have a good deal of conversation with Victor. He was also
told the results of Sir Geoffrey's researches. He was convinced that
the other Victor was the real Victor, or rather the more developed part
of the whole Victor, and the present Victor a mere splinter.
Integration of the two personalities, he suggested might produce a
Victor no less brilliant than the absent one, but also better balanced.
He insisted that the case could not be tackled unless the young man was
brought to his private mental home for constant treatment. Sir Geoffrey
promised that he would try to persuade his son voluntarily to comply
with this suggestion. But when he broached the matter, Victor responded
with neurotic anger and self-pity.</p>

<p>The weeks slipped by. Nothing was done about recovering Victor's
job. Sir Geoffrey was convinced, but did not say so, that the boy was
in no fit state to undertake responsibility. He was still subject to
attacks of black depression, and he sometimes fell into a state verging
on coma. When he was more or less fit, he spent most of his time
motoring very fast about the country. (His sports car had been
preserved for him.) He also did a good deal of shooting. And he tried
to stage a comeback into local society. In this he was not very
successful, for people were on their guard against anyone who was known
to have hehaved eccentrically.</p>

<p>After a couple of months it was clear to Sir Geoffrey that his son
was not making any progress. He complained of violent headaches, which
often ended in a twelve-hour sleep. On one occasion he declared that he
was fighting desperately for sanity "against the forces of darkness".
Pressed to amplify this statement, he said that ideas utterly alien to
his nature kept breaking in on him, crazy fragments of thought about
social strife, about irreligion, about sexual licentiousness. Also he
complained that he was being haunted by "the filthy face of the slut".
Sir Geoffrey reluctantly decided that the time was at hand when it
would be necessary to over-ride Victor's wishes and send him away for
treatment.</p>

<p>The idea did cross his mind that Maggie might possibly be able to
settle the conflict of the two Victors by restoring the one whom she
loved. He considered making contact with her, but postponed doing so,
fearing awkward complications. It was Maggie herself who finally took
action.</p>

<p>When at last she visited Victor's lodgings, she found his landlady
very much on her guard, for she did not consider that this ugly girl
was good enough for her dear lodger. However, Maggie's obvious
sincerity and distress gradually won her, and she told Maggie of Sir
Geoffrey's visit, and gave his address. Maggie promptly wrote, telling
him the main facts about her relations with his son, and imploring him
to let her meet Victor, in the hope that her presence might "restore
him to sanity". Meanwhile she privately redoubled her efforts to cure
him by telepathic influence.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey feared that if Victor were confronted with Maggie in
person he would be driven to frenzy, and might break down completely.
But the father came to feel that at least he had better meet the girl
himself to form some opinion of her character, with a view to enlisting
her help in some way or other, if in his view she passed muster. So he
replied to her letter cautiously, and said he would prefer to discuss
the whole matter with her before allowing her to see his son. He
therefore proposed to meet her. At first he found himself in some doubt
about the correct way of effecting an interview with a servant girl on
such a delicate subject; but a little consideration made him realize
that, if Maggie was to be of any use at all, she must be treated with
the respect due to the woman whom Victor had admired. He therefore
arranged to have her to lunch on her "day off" in a respectable though
unobtrusive restaurant in the town where she worked.</p>

<p>Maggie's presence had a disturbing effect on Sir Geoffrey. Like the
Dolt, he found her face repugnant; but like the true Victor he was
attracted by her direct and genial personality. Indeed, by the time
they had reached the coffee he was beginning, in spite of his
conventional standards of feminine beauty, to feel a fascination even
in her strange face. Obviously she was of far too lowly a social class
to be a desirable match for the son of a successful colonial
administrator; but, damn it, she was not the slut that the present
Victor had described. Indeed, much to his surprise Sir Geoffrey found
his manner changing from formal politeness to real friendliness. But he
refused to let Maggie see his son. The shock, he insisted, would be too
great. Instead, he proposed to tell Victor that he had met her, and to
build up in the young man's mind a true picture of the girl whom, in
his other phase, he loved. With this end in view he encouraged Maggie
to tell him more about her past relations with his son, and her own
past life. This she gladly did, trying (as she told me) to infuse the
old gentleman's mind with a sense of the joyful harmony and mutual
dependence that had sprung up between Victor and herself. Excusably she
said nothing about the more sordid side of her life in Aberdeen and
Glasgow.</p>

<p>When Sir Geoffrey reached home and met Victor again, his son seemed
to sense that his father had somehow betrayed him. Indeed, he became so
suspicious and despondent that Sir Geoffrey felt it would be unwise to
tell him about the recent interview while he was so unbalanced. Next
day Victor complained of a "terrible headache", and vertigo. "That foul
woman," he said, "has been attacking me again, It's worse than ever."
Sir Geoffrey changed his mind and took the plunge. "You have got the
girl all wrong," he said. "I have seen her, and though she certainly is
remarkably plain, she strikes me as being an admirable person." Victor
had stretched himself out on a couch, and at this information he fell
into a spluttering, trembling, impotent rage. Presently he closed his
eyes and assumed the expression of a martyr. His father felt acute
disgust in watching his son, so he rose and walked about the room,
recounting his impressions of Maggie. Presently he stopped, and noticed
that Victor was apparently asleep, with his head back and his jaw
dropped. His father tried to wake him, but he was in a deep coma.
Wondering what to do next, Sir Geoffrey sat down and watched his son.
Presently the mouth closed, the eyes opened. Sir Geoffrey noticed a
subtle change of expression. The eyes were wide and alert. The father
saw at once that he was confronted with the face of the photograph in
Mrs. Wheelwright's possession. Victor sat up, stretched his arms, and
laughed. He said, "Thank God I'm awake again!" For a few seconds only,
he looked about him in some bewilderment. Then his eyes met his
father's with a steady, smiling gaze. Presently he said, "Thanks, Dad,
for being so good to me during these wretched weeks, and coming round
to take my side against that somnolent ass that masquerades as me." Sir
Geoffrey said nothing. He was fascinated by the change in his son.
Victor said, "Look! After lunch I'll rush off to see Maggie and get
everything straight. Then, if I may, I'll come back here some time, and
tell you all about her. Believe me, I appreciate my father much better:
than that other son does; specially after these weeks, and after what
you said about Maggie just now." He smiled brightly, like the
photograph.</p>

<p>The new Victor was, of course in possession of the old Victor's
memories. After his moment of bewilderment, he knew perfectly well
where he was, and had a clear recollection of all the Dolt's
conversations with his father. "Of course," he told me, "I was not
awake at the time, but after only a few seconds of confusion I could
remember all that I had done in that foul sleep-walk of a life."
Latterly the Dolt had been tormented by obsessive images and thoughts
that (said Victor) must have originated with Maggie. He felt confident
that some strange telepathic influence from Maggie had been the main
cause of his waking to his true self. His one desire was to see her at
once and tell her that she had saved him. His father tried to persuade
him to stay at least for one night to rest, but Victor said that he
would feel much more secure if he could be with Maggie that very day.
Sir Geoffrey admitted the force of this argument.</p>

<p>Father and son had a long talk before they parted. Sir Geoffrey
admitted that he had read part of Victor's manuscript, and they drifted
into a general discussion. The upshot for Sir Geoffrey was that he had
no further doubt as to which was the better Victor; and he saw that
this new Victor must be helped by every possible means to become firmly
established. Yet he could not feel for the new Victor the warm parental
affection which he had always felt for the familiar Victor, even when
he had been most critical of him. This new son of his was a stranger; a
brilliant and a generous-minded stranger, no doubt, but a person whom
his father did not really know, and one whose opinions were in many
ways rash and subversive. Though the old Victor had treated him with a
kind of respectful contempt, the father had never felt resentful;
probably because he so earnestly longed to be able to regard his son as
his superior. On the other hand, the new Victor treated his father with
man-to-man equality and friendliness. But at every turn his quick mind
had to wait for the old man to catch up. When the father had occasion
to protest against the wild views of the son, Victor attended earnestly
to his criticism, but demolished it ruthlessly, not hesitating to
charge his parent with sheer muddle- headedness. His attitude was that
of a friendly but outspoken equal. Sir Geoffrey had been accustomed to
deference. At first he was a little bewildered.</p>

<p>Victor wired to Maggie to expect him that evening, and to Mrs.
Wheelwright to re-engage his rooms, if they were still vacant. When he
met Maggie he told her that she had saved him. The detached reader will
note that there is no real proof that she ever did on any occasion
actually exercise any supernormal or occult powers over him. The dreams
and visions that plagued the Dolt might well have risen from the
suppressed side of his own nature. On the other hand, the final
changeover to the true Victor may, of course, be fairly plausibly
explained as the work of some sort of telepathic influence from Maggie,
director through the medium of Sir Geoffrey, whose mind had so recently
been deeply affected by her. This is what Maggie and Victor believed;
but the sceptic is quite entitled to his doubts. Subsequent events,
which I shall relate in due course, do not suggest to me that Maggie's
supernormal powers, if they existed, were very effective. Victor,
however, was always convinced that they had saved him, and that he
constantly depended on her influence.</p>

<p>Maggie was now determined to live with Victor so as to use all her
influence to keep the Dolt at bay. She proposed to give a month's
notice to her employers and have the wedding as soon as she was free.
Victor was torn between the desire to be united with Maggie as soon as
possible and fear of tying her to the Dolt. She confidently believed
that the Dolt could never return as long as she was constantly with
Victor. The awake Victor was still dismayed by the recent dominance of
the Dolt, and therefore hesitant about involving Maggie in a permanent
relationship. In the end it was agreed that they should wait for a few
weeks to see how things went.</p>

<p>Time passed, and it did indeed seem that Victor was thoroughly re-
established in self-possession. He met Maggie every week, and they slid
easily back into the old life, with the difference that they were now
acknowledged lovers, and she proudly wore an engagement ring. They
frequented all their old haunts, and everything was transfigured by the
knowledge that now at last they were pledged to one another. Yet the
future was uncertain, for Victor still retained his scruples.</p>

<p>The time came for Maggie to have her short annual holiday. In the
past she had generally used it for a hasty visit to Shetland, though on
one occasion she had joined Katie in a trip to London. This time, both
she and Victor assumed that the two of them would spend Maggie's
holiday together. But in what capacity? As newly-weds? As unmarried
lovers? If so, they would certainly have to masquerade as a married
pair if they wanted to share a room. But the scruples which held Victor
back from marrying Maggie, prevented him also from having a temporary
union with her. He himself (he told me) scarcely understood his motive.
Obviously it was not conventional morality that restrained him, for it
had not restrained him before. Vaguely he felt that to consummate their
"spiritual marriage", even without a legal union, would entangle her
too deeply with him to allow her to free herself if the Dolt were to
return. Always he was haunted by the fear that he might at any moment
give place to the Dolt. Moreover, he felt that, quite apart from his
own uncertainty, it would be wiser, in view of Maggie's former
revulsion against sex, not to mate with her until they were even more
deeply involved mentally.</p>

<p>In view of these scruples, Victor suggested to Maggie that they
should go on holiday together as brother and sister. This proposal
distressed Maggie. It revived her old suspicion that, in spite of all
his affection for her, Victor suffered from an unacknowledged physical
repulsion. This suspicion in turn, made her behave less warmly toward
him.</p>

<p>However, they spent their holiday as he wished. They did a walking
tour in the Lakes, from Youth Hostel to Youth Hostel; and they walked
so strenuously that their vow of chastity was re-enforced by fatigue.
They climbed all the main heights, for Maggie was a sturdy young woman
and eager to prove her mettle. Victor persuaded her to venture on a
little rock-climbing, "just to know what it's like", but she soon
decided that "risking one's neck for the mere thrill of it was a mug's
game". Sitting on the loose summit of Nape's Needle, she vowed that if
she got down safely she would never climb again. Victor did not press
her. Indeed, he admitted that, if you felt no need to test yourself, it
was foolish to do so. Rock-climbing therefore gave place to scrambling
and walking, watching buzzards and ravens, admiring the skill of
sheep-dogs, conversing with their masters, bathing in tams, and looking
forward to the next meal. One day on High Street they encountered seven
red deer, including a "stag of ten". This incident stirred them both,
but especially Victor. "Extraordinary," he told me, "how the wild
animal in its native environment seems quite a different creature from
the same kind in the zoo. Those free beasts were so lithe and lean and
sleek, in fact in perfect training. They stood for a moment taking the
scent of us with dilating nostrils, then turned and cantered away over
the deep heather with their easy bounds, like sailing boats in a fair
breeze, breasting the waves. Somehow we felt that, though we were much
cleverer animals, they had something more important than cleverness,
something that we had lost, perfect rapport with the environment,
harmony with the universe, intimacy with God!" Victor laughed,
apologizing for this fantasy.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this holiday that Victor wrote to me to suggest
a meeting.</p>

<p>Talking late into the night in the hotel lounge, he at last
completed his story. He looked at me quizzically, and said, "Well, what
would you do in my position? Marry her? Live with her 'in sin'? Carry
on still longer in the present uncomfortable way? Or cut adrift
altogether?" All I could find to say was that if he did not want to
entangle her, he should not have allowed himself to see so much of her.
He said, "Of course! But here I am, in a fix. What would you do now?"
After a long silence, I brought myself to say, "Either marry her as
soon as possible, or give her up completely. Don't go on havering." For
some minutes he said nothing. Then, knocking out his pipe and rising,
he said "Well, thanks! You are a damned good listener. Queer how
talking to you clears my mind, even if I don't finally act on your
advice." We both went up to our rooms.</p>

<h2>9 - VICTOR FORGES AHEAD</h2>

<h4>From 1924 to 1929</h4>

<p>IT WAS OVER FIVE YEARS before I met Victor again. During most of
this time I was teaching in India. I had always wanted an opportunity
to see the East; and when the chance came to take up a post as lecturer
in English in an Indian college, I accepted it. Not till 1929 did I
return to England on leave. Victor had occasionally written to me, but
he was not a painstaking correspondent, and I knew little of his
affairs except the bare fact that, very soon after I had seen him,
Maggie had come to live with him. In the eyes of the law they were
still unmarried, because he was still anxious lest he should have
another relapse. But in spirit they were man and wife. The actual
marriage was not to come till later, when Victor felt himself
completely secure, and it was time for Maggie to have children.</p>

<p>When at last I visited them, I found them established in a little
suburban house in the north-country town which was the centre from
which Victor worked. Victor opened the door to me himself, and greeted
me warmly. As we held each other's hands in greeting, I stared at him.
For he had changed. The years had naturally left a mark on his face,
but there was something there besides the signs of maturity. There was
a new expression which I could not yet decipher, a curious combination
of gentleness about the eyes and hardness or perhaps bitterness about
the lips. I stared so long that he laughed and said, "Oh, yes, I've
weathered a lot. So have you, but you look quite well, though a bit
dried up with the sun."</p>

<p>He took my hat and coat, and called for Maggie. She emerged from the
kitchen with a welcoming smile that gave me some hint of the beauty
that Victor alone could see in her. Her features were even more
pronounced and strange than they had been when I saw her some eight
years earlier, as a waitress. But in spite of the years, and a few
lines on the forehead and round the eyes, she looked quite young;
partly, no doubt because her face was bronzed from a recent holiday,
but more because of a general air of well-being and zest.</p>

<p>The little sitting-room was sparsely furnished, mostly in the light
wood that was then becoming modish. Over the mantelpiece was a print of
a Breughel. On another wall were some rather luscious forest scenes
which I could not believe to be quite in accord with Victor's taste.
Altogether the room was a mixture of the highly sophisticated and the
naive. The curtains suggested a lodging-house, a thoroughly nice
lodging-house; but we drank sherry out of Swedish glasses. Strangely,
this curious combination of styles throughout the house did not offend
me. They effected a sort of humorous harmony which, I suspected,
symbolized the relation between Victor and Maggie themselves.</p>

<p>It was soon clear that the unofficial marriage was a great success,
and that in many ways Victor depended on Maggie for security. His eyes
would often quickly seek hers as though for confirmation of something
which he had just said to me. And once, as he passed behind her chair
to fetch something, he fleetingly laid a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Later in my visit, while Maggie was preparing a meal, and Victor and
I were sitting in the little garden, he remarked that before she had
come to him he must have been spending a great deal of energy in
"merely keeping the Dolt at bay", but that with her daily presence to
strengthen him he had far more energy to spare, and a new sense of
peace and security. Only on occasions when they were separated for a
week or more did he feel anything of the old need to watch himself, and
then merely as a vague loneliness and anxiety, not as a real
threat.</p>

<p>In more practical ways also, Maggie was helpful. Not only did she
look after the house, but also she entered actively into Victor's
affairs. She had visited all his evening classes, and had struck up a
real friendship with several of his students. Evidently she fulfilled
an important function in his work. She said, "When Victor works up a
new subject, he always tries it on the dog first, namely me. Sometimes
the poor animal finds it heavy going and can't keep awake. Sometimes it
has a nervous breakdown, like those unfortunate dogs he told me about
that some great Russian experimenter tormented with intelligence tests
that were just a bit too difficult for them. Sometimes this adoring dog
just sits enthralled, forgetting its knitting. Sometimes it asks such a
lot of silly questions and raises so many difficulties that poor Victor
gets quite cross with it." Here Victor put in, "And then I have to go
away and rewrite the whole thing. Oh, she's a useful critic, though
exasperating, and wilfuly stupid. Then--how I hate her!" On the
occasions when she visited his classes, her function (I gathered) was
partly to watch the reactions of the members, and partly to watch
Victor himself. On the journey home she would report her findings;
protesting, perhaps, against Victor's mannerisms, or suggesting that
some disheartened or timid individual needed special treatment. "In
fact," said Victor, summing it all up, "her function is to give me
hell."</p>

<p>On one occasion during my brief visit, Victor expressed perplexity
about a certain class secretary who had shown more zeal than honesty by
marking on the class register attendances that had not occurred, What
ought the wretched tutor to do about it? Should he turn a blind eye, or
make a fuss, and cause endless trouble with the authorities? The
question was not a real request for advice but rather a statement of
'perplexity. I was amused by Maggie's technique for dealing with Victor
on this occasion. I saw her take a sidelong glance at her man, and then
she continued her knitting in silence. Presently she said, "What would
happen if you made a fuss?"</p>

<p>"Trouble, hate, and a shindy with the B. of E."</p>

<p>"What would happen if you turned a blind eye?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! It wouldn't even make a difference to the Government grant
earned by the class, because there'll be more than enough attendances
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Which do you care for most, educating the workers or personal
righteousness?" He laughed, and turned to me. "It's terrible," he said,
"to be linked for life with an immoral woman. Instead of being a force
making for righteousness, she leads me into temptation at every
turn."</p>

<p>She too laughed, and remarked, "Poor Victor! He never has the moral
courage to be immoral; so when he wants to be, he always has to get me
to take the blame for him. Then he can do it with a good
conscience."</p>

<p>Maggie had also been of service to Victor in the writing of the book
which he had begun some six years earlier. This incipient masterpiece
had been rewritten several times, and was now radically different from
the early draft that his father had seen. "He calls it," said Maggie,
"his web, and himself Penelope." He explained, "The trouble is, I'm
mentally growing up rather fast, and everything I wrote even a year ago
begins to look puerile." I suggested that he should not hold it back,
but publish it in its present form as a sort of interim report. "No
good," he said, "It would all have to be got into shape and polished,
and I can't be bothered to do that with stuff that I have already
outgrown. Besides, there are far too many half-baked books
already."</p>

<p>Maggie seemed to regard her function in relation to the book as
twofold. She must stimulate him into finishing it and publishing it as
soon as possible, and she must force him to write so that ordinary
intelligent people could follow him without undue effort. But Victor,
who regarded his "web" neither as educational nor as propaganda but as
sheer self-expression, rebelled against both these orders. "After all,"
he said, smiling at Maggie, "it's meant for educated people, not for
country wenches and the scum of provincial towns, like you." Ignoring
the sally, she said, "He'll never publish anything really worthwhile
unless I stand over him with a rolling-pin. Of course there were those
very respectable contributions to highbrow magazines, political and
philosophical. They really began to make a name for him. But he gave up
that sort of thing long ago because he said his ideas were still in the
melting-pot, and he must get them clear before inflicting any more of
them on people. Then at one time he used to write marvellous little
articles for Leftish journals, but even that has stopped now. And
anyhow he can't really put the whole of himself Into that sort of
thing. It's time he got his teeth into something that will call out all
his powers." Victor insisted that the book certainly did that. She
said, "Well, yes, in a way; but it's like a rough sketch that is always
being rubbed out and begun again. For your soul's health it's necessary
to produce a finished bit of creation. Otherwise you'll go bad on my
hands."</p>

<p>She looked at him long and anxiously. He replied in a serious voice.
"No, Maggie, I have to judge for myself in that field. You can help me
a lot, but you can't dictate the sort of thing I want to write. At
present I am mentally in a muddle, and it's no use rushing into print
until I have straightened things out. And as for being intelligible to
ordinary people, you always claim to be one of them, and you seem to
follow it all pretty well."</p>

<p>"But," she said, "I don't follow it until I've made you rewrite it
all in simpler language. And of course, I'm no longer really ordinary.
I have been hopelessly infected by you. If I had not been, I shouldn't
be able to make head or tail of the stuff."</p>

<p>"The fact is," he said, "you're so anxious to react as the ordinary
person that you over-compensate, and affect a sort of wilful, pigheaded
stupidity that goes far beyond ordinary people." He gave her a
love-signalling smile, to which she replied in kind.</p>

<p>"The fact is," she said, "you think ordinary people are like the
people in your classes, but they're not. They are far stupider, and
moreover they don't want to think." He closed the matter by saying,
"Well, anyhow, I'm not writing for ordinary people. I reach them (more
or less) in my teaching. In my writing I'm writing for myself, to
straighten out my own mind. But unfortunately my mind C won't stay put.
It keeps seeing new things which involve restating everything."</p>

<p>I wanted to find out what Victor's book was about, and if possible
to persuade him to let me read the manuscript. All he would say was,
"The jumping-off point was dialectical materialism, but by now it's
neither dialectical nor materialist in any but the most Pickwickian
sense." When I asked him point blank if I could read it, he answered,
"Of course, if you like; when I have straightened out a few things."
But he was still straightening them out when I left.</p>

<p>Altogether, I found it impossible to form a clear picture of
Victor's state of mind at this time. He was not very communicative. I
learned that he had been drawn more and more into Left Wing political
activity, and that there had been difficulties with the university. He
had joined the C.P. His articles in Left Wing journals had in early
days all been written under a pseudonym; but later this secretiveness
irked him, and he took to using his own name, in the form "Vic Smith".
It was this frankness that had caused difficulties with the
authorities. There was also trouble over his expression of
"Communistic" opinions in his classes. The work of adult education was
supposed to be "non-political", in the party sense. It was concerned
with teaching people to think for themselves, not with political
propaganda. Certain prominent Conservatives in the town started an
agitation against spending public money to aid classes that were
hotbeds of "Marxism". Further, Victor had been mixed up in scandals
connected with the unemployed. Once, for instance, he had entertained a
party of them at the city's most exclusive restaurant. He had also been
mixed up with disorders that had occurred when a procession of
unemployed was refused admission to the Town Hall. He was arrested, and
had to spend a night in a police cell, but was released because the
evidence against him was insufficient. That night, Maggie suffered
acute anxiety, fearing that the shock might recall the Dolt. But he
returned to her as his normal self, and indeed elated. He said, "A
little direct action is exhilarating after all the mere talking."</p>

<p>The upshot of all this activity was that his employers reluctantly
warned him that his rashness was damaging to his authority as a
teacher, and that unless he would promise to avoid entanglement in
party politics, he would have to go. Victor firmly rejected this
ultimatum, much to Maggie's distress.</p>

<p>His father also was much upset. The old gentleman had maintained
friendly, though intermittent, relations with his "new" son. On
Victor's brief visits to the old home there had always been violent
arguments, but always an underlying mutual respect. Not until Victor's
name began to appear in the press as an agitator and a revolutionary,
did the father try to assert his paternal authority. Of course he
failed; and according to his own ethic he was left with no alternative
but to "disown the boy" and refuse to see him again. Sir Geoffrey was
now beginning to threaten to disinherit his son. Natural affection,
however, in the end triumphed over his political principles. Worry
brought on by this conflict in the old man's mind seems to have
hastened the stroke from which he died.</p>

<p>Victor was much distressed at the breach with the parent for whom he
had conceived a warm though critical respect. His first impulse was to
renounce the small amount of capital which came to him, and hand it
over to some worthy cause which would have been approved of by his
father. But the practical Maggie, with an eye on Victor's precarious
future and her own future maternity, dissuaded him from this
course.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the university authorities who employed Victor were no
less distressed than his father; for they regarded Victor with respect
and affection, and also as a valuable asset. Every effort was made to
persuade him to agree to refrain in future from compromising
activities; but in vain. So Victor was regretfully dismissed. This was
shortly after the end of his winter classes.</p>

<p>But, to everyone's surprise, before work began again in the autumn,
he had accepted the conditions and was preparing for his usual
classes.</p>

<p>Naturally I was curious to know what it was that had brought about
this change of attitude. It was quite incredible that Victor should
simply have taken the line of least resistance. It was not until my
last evening that he made any serious attempt to explain himself.
Hitherto, when challenged, he had merely said, "I just had to get away
from it all and think," or "I found I wasn't really sure of my own
foundations after all." But on the last evening I managed to provoke
him into fuller explanation.</p>

<p>We were all three in the little sitting-room. Maggie was working
through a pile of mending. Victor, who liked to have some manual work
on hand when he was carrying on a desultory conversation with an easy
guest, was repairing an electric iron. I sat idly smoking.</p>

<p>I pressed him to tell me why he had given up political action. For a
while, he merely went on fiddling with the intestines of the iron; but
presently he said, "Well, it was like this. When I was trying my hand
at agitation for the unemployed, I met a lot of people in that line
whose hearts were fight (up to a point) but their heads all wrong. And
their wrong heads kept pulling their hearts askew, so to speak. They
were afire with generous passion for the underdog, but they had
theories that didn't go deep enough; theories about human nature and
historical forces. Misinterpreting Marx, they believed that human
nature was simply an expression of environmental influences, whereas,
of course, in truth, at every stage of evolution, there's always
something inside reacting to something outside. This mistake led
inevitably to a muddle over morality, and in the end to sheer
opportunism. Then there were others whose trouble began in the heart
and reacted on the head. Their real motive was not a generous passion,
though they thought it was, but some sort of bottled-up hate. And this,
of course, messed up their ideas. Mind you, the work we were doing had
to be done. It was important. But sooner or later it was going to be
important to have the right ideas behind it, otherwise it would all go
bad on us. And as no one else seemed to be worrying about that side of
the thing, it was clearly up to me to do something about it. That meant
giving up active political work, for a while anyhow, and trying to
digest what I had learnt through it. For really did learn a lot, about
human nature, and about myself. But I had an increasing feeling that I
needed new light if I was to form clear ideas about social problems,
and about man's nature. In fact what I needed was to think things out
with all possible concentration, and without distraction from current
urgencies."</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence, intent upon the dismembered iron, It was
Maggie who prompted him, saying, "Come on, Victor, tell him what you
did learn."</p>

<p>"I learned," he said, "the huge difference between man's best and
his worst. And I learned more about the oddness of my own nature,
compared with other people's. And I saw that all ordinary people are in
a way a mixture of me and the Dolt, and that my relation with the Dolt
threw light on the whole social problem."</p>

<p>Again he fell silent, working with his pliers. But Maggie prompted
him, "Tell him about the demonstrations of the unemployed."</p>

<p>He began reluctantly, "Oh, well! It sounds flat in the telling, but
it really is significant. Unemployment was already very bad in this
unhappy town. The Communists began organizing mass meetings of the
workless, and I had a good deal to do with this job. I found the
unemployed utterly disheartened and cynical. They were poisoned by the
sense of being 'not wanted', chucked on the scrap-heap. Many were so
used to idling that they seemed to have lost all power of exerting
themselves. Some of the long-timers, though not all, had turned
apathetic through and through, even toward their own wives and
families. And they had lost all self-respect. Yet, if once an idea or
an ideal could penetrate their fop; of misery, and really present
itself to their minds, they might respond magnificently with acts of
real generosity or comradeship. Thus the very same man who was so
wrapped up in his personal misery that he had no heart for anything
else; shrugging his shoulders over his child's illness, might suddenly
feel the child's reality and nurse it with the utmost devotion. The man
who lost job after job through irresponsibility or sheer slacking, or
who habitually pilfered from his mates, might suddenly be lit up by the
idea of a mass protest for human fellowship, and work splendidly for
the cause. Mind you, many Leftish journalists sentimentalized the
unemployed, making out that they were all saints. They weren't. A few
were magnificent. Most were just normal people for whom there were no
jobs going, and of course most of these had been morally damaged by
their bitter fate. Quite a lot were simply wasters and riff-raff.
Inevitably in a labour glut there are bound to be unemployed of all
calibres. It was cheering to find that nearly all but the lowest grade
could see (with help) the idea of the march not merely in terms of
individualistic clamouring for decent treatment but as a gesture for
the idea of brotherhood. And for the sake of this gesture they could
rise to heroism."</p>

<p>Again he was silent. Maggie put in a word. "And it fell to Victor to
wake these people; and to keep them awake, because they were always apt
to break down under some silly little temptation."</p>

<p>"And that," he said, "was what made me realize so clearly the
difference between them and myself. When they behaved in the awake way,
nine times out of ten they had a grim moral struggle, and came through
heroically. Even when they had formed regular habits of social loyalty,
there was a perpetual tension in their minds. But with me, there's no
serious tension at all, I just see the thing to do, and wholeheartedly
want to do it; even if from the point of view of my own self-interest
it is very objectionable. To refrain from doing it would be repugnant
and painful. It's queer, I know, but there it is. Obviously I can't
take any credit for this. The credit belongs only to the moral heroes
who struggle against temptation, and gloriously triumph; if credit is a
meaningful notion, which I sometimes doubt."</p>

<p>Maggie interrupted. "I think you make it clearer when you say, not
that you have no struggle, but that the struggle does not enter into
yourself. Once you said it went on outside your very self, like the
struggle of the white corpuscles to conquer invading micro-organisms,
which consciousness knows nothing of."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it's like that, except that I am not strictly
unconscious of the struggle. I am conscious of it clearly enough, but
objectively. For my consciousness there's no internal struggle at all.
The end, the goal, simply possesses and uses me."</p>

<p>I felt incredulous about his claim to have no moral struggle, and I
said so. After some thought he replied, "Yes, in a way you are right. I
do have moral struggles sometimes, but they are all on a different
plane from the ordinary ones that torment most people. So far as sheer
individualistic self-interest is concerned, I really don't have any
struggle at all. I quite happily want to do the thing that others often
find it impossible to will effectively. But I do have moral struggles
of a kind. For instance, I have had a severe moral struggle to give up
the C.P. and renounce political activity. You see, both political
activity in general and the C.P. in particular still felt right for me;
but little by little it was borne in on me that I ought to give them up
to pursue another goal. It would have been much easier to carry on
politically, but I had to take myself in hand and conquer my
established moral habit. Yes, Harry, in a way you're right."</p>

<p>At this point I may as well break the historical sequence to mention
a future moral struggle that Victor was to have. After turning away
from political action and the C.P. he had inclined more and more to
pacifism. This was during the earlier part of the inter-war period.
Later, as the Nazi menace increased and the farce of "appeasement"
developed, Victor was to be forced very reluctantly to see that even
the sacred principle of non-violence must in certain circumstances be
qualified. But he had formed such a strong moral habit of pacifism that
he was faced with a grim moral struggle to break with that habit.</p>

<p>But I must revert to his situation during my visit in 1929, and his
abandonment of political action. Victor had a good deal to say about
his experiences over the demonstrations by the unemployed. "Of course,"
he said, "The Communists had a lot to do with organizing the unemployed
in this town. And though inevitably some Communists were mere wasters
or spitemongers, most worked splendidly. Now some of these seemed
almost to have passed beyond the stage of individualistic moral
struggle, seeming to serve the cause with single-hearted passion. When
they were at their best, temptation to put self-interest first didn't
seriously touch them at all. They really were 'possessed'. But with
them the trouble was that their view of the goal and of the policy was
often distorted by subterranean hungers. Some, for instance, were loyal
to the Revolution not through love, but because under its banner their
unwitting vindictiveness could find a sanctioned outlet."</p>

<p>Maggie said, "At first the Communists admired him immensely. Some
called him the English Lenin, because he was so good at inspiring and
organizing. But when there were difficulties over the party line, they
reviled him."</p>

<p>Victor continued. "They had seen something of the true goal. (Call
it fullness of life for all.) It really did, in a way, possess them.
But they had only seen it superficially. They didn't really know what
fullness of life involved. Rebelling violently against individualism,
they made a god of society, the ideal communist society, of course. The
free democratic society was their ultimate goal, but meanwhile they
were concerned only to establish the close-knit revolutionary state.
What they could never see was that, though one must identify oneself
with society, one must also, even for society's sake, be true to
oneself, even if that meant going against the party line. Then again,
they couldn't see that flouting the best moral tradition of society was
a seriously harmful thing to do, even from the point of view of the
Revolution itself. The end justifies the means, yes; but only if the
means do not in the long run poison the end. The trouble with them was
that they were too impatient ever to think of the long run. For the
urgency of the Revolution you might steal and lie and beat people up,
and even betray your friend, regardless of the effect of it all on the
quality of the Revolution."</p>

<p>Silence again. Victor seemed absorbed in the electrical problem, or
in his own thoughts. Maggie prompted him. "Tell him how you came to
loggerheads with them."</p>

<p>"The turning point," he said, "was when they expected me to write
articles in the local press to the effect that the organization of the
unemployed was entirely spontaneous, and not inspired by the Communists
in the first instance. I was also to tell my university friends the
same lie. When I protested, they replied that it really didn't matter
lying, even to personal friends, if it was for the Revolution. The
important thing was to make people believe there was a real popular
protest, non-political in origin. That was the only way to rouse the
public and start up serious political action, and so on. When I refused
to do this bit of bare-faced lying, they said I cared more about
keeping my hands clean than serving the Revolution; or else more about
keeping in with my employers; or else that I had not freed myself from
the spell of bourgeois morality. We had many long and heated arguments,
in which they simply insisted that the Revolution justified any means
whatever, and I insisted that a reputation for irresponsible lying
would do the cause no good. To this they merely answered that the lie
would never be found out. Neither side gave way an inch. In the end I
just said I wouldn't do the job, and if they persuaded someone else to
do it, I would publish the truth."</p>

<p>I asked Victor if that was the end of his active political work.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I carried on as before for a while, but the comrades
who had called me the English Lenin now turned violently against me.
Mind you, I don't blame them. They sincerely believed I was a menace to
the Revolution. Some even persuaded themselves I was actually working
for the capitalists. So everything I did was misrepresented, often
deliberately. Most of the politically conscious unemployed were turned
against me, and some of those who were not politically conscious at all
were caught by the rumour that I was a police spy."</p>

<p>Maggie said, "But give credit where it is due. Many of the non-
politicals who knew you fairly well just laughed at the whole slander,
and said they knew you were sound."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Victor, "and of course that was gratifying. But when a
general meeting was held (at my request), It became clear that I could
no longer hold the mass of the unemployed as I had done. The Communist
line was easier for them to grasp, and from their point of view the
charges against me were damning. I put my case as simply as I could,
and at the time they took it superbly. I said the particular issue was
a minor one, but a principle was at stake that was immensely important
for the Revolution. I asked them what they really wanted, just a
successful agitation in our town, or a whole new and radically
transformed society, based on friendliness and mutual confidence. I
tried to show what would happen if the Revolution turned savage, and
what might happen if we won through without sacrificing the goal for
immediate petty gains."</p>

<p>Maggie again, "And when he sat down they raised the roof."</p>

<p>Victor sighed, "Yes! I thought I had done the trick. I thought this
might be the little significant event that would change the course of
history. But I was mistaken. The comrade who was put up to defend the
orthodox line was a local party leader, one of those who see everything
black or white, and will go through hell for the white. He was an
artisan, and he had devoted his life to the class war. He never spared
himself, and his health was undermined. I had always respected him for
his courage, and in a way for his sincerity; though I suspected he was
deceiving himself about a lot of things, and I had never been able to
make a real human contact with him." Here Victor jerked out an
exasperated lit de laugh. "Queer!" he said, "I was always sparring with
that fellow, and I felt he was really an evil influence, and yet, damn
it, I couldn't help liking him, even loving him. And in a furtive sort
of way 1 believe he liked me too, but he tried hard not to. And so
there was always a barrier, even when we were working harmoniously
together. The trouble was that he was proud of being a fanatic, and
proud of being Machiavellian. Really I think he was at heart a muddled
sort of saint who had forced himself to be tough and ruthless and a
demagogue. Well, he enjoyed fighting me on that occasion. He began by
saying I had almost persuaded him to change his mind and speak on my
side. (They cheered.) But cold reason, he said, had saved him. Then he
went through my speech point by point, giving a false interpretation to
everything, and quoting Marxian texts against me very skilfully. Little
by little he worked up to the charge that this unrealistic idealism
would hamstring the Revolution, and finally he indulged in a lot of
scurrilous stuff (which I am sure he believed) to prove I was sexually'
incorrect', and politically a bourgeois Liberal, consciously or
unconsciously on the side of reaction. When he sat down there was an
uproar, mainly favourable to him. There were other speakers, for and
against; but those on my side were obviously rattled. When my turn came
to reply, there was so much noise I couldn't get any coherent answer
across at all. I Inight have been trying to talk to a crowd of excited
apes."</p>

<p>I said, "But I don't see how this made you any less sure of your own
position, your own foundations." He remained silent for some time.
Maggie said, "The poor dear felt he had failed, and this was almost a
new experience for him, on such a scale. So he reckoned there must be
something wrong with him if he couldn't hold the crowd back from
lapping up dope."</p>

<p>Victor spoke again. "The whole business got me down rather badly. I
was dead tired and sleepy and fed up. I even began to wonder whether my
line really had been crazy idealism, and my unconscious motive really
had been to secure my own position in the status quo. Also, I felt a
sudden stab of wounded vanity; and of course I knew very well that
personal vanity, however fleeting, was a danger signal meaning that the
Dolt was stirring in me. So I had to run to Maggie for help."</p>

<p>Maggie said, "I put him on to mending a broken chair, and then
digging in the garden, till he could take a balanced view again."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but the fact remained that I had completely failed
to fortify those people against the over-simplified ideas of the party.
I felt I must, after all, have a wrong conception of the springs of
human action. It had seemed to me that, if people could be made to see
what was good, they would certainly will it--as the audience did during
my speech. But after all I had evidently underestimated the power of
the positive evil will to take charge of them, to blind them to the
good that they had seen. Of course, I am not identifying doctrinaire
Communism with the evil will. Its main driving force is often the good
will. But unfortunately the evil will in us can use the good will for
its own ends, turning it subtly bad in us without our knowing what has
happened. In my Communist opponent, for instance; and in the Dolt. I
had assumed that the whole difference between me and the Dolt was that
I could see more clearly than he could, and so I inevitably willed more
wisely. But now I began to realize that there was something more
positive in him than mere blindness, mere absence of vision. Something
or other could destroy vision, and so destroy the good will. Of course
I knew in a way that this thing was just the primitive will, rebelling
against the developed will; or the perverted will, obsessed with
primitive ends, resisting the more enlightened will; or the somnolent
self, opposing the awake self; or the unregenerate spirit striving to
prevent the birth of the twice-born spirit. But all this was metaphor.
What positive thing was there, blotting out the vision, perverting the
will? In my own case, I felt that there was some very positive power
holding the Dolt together against the truer vision; and that Maggie, in
keeping the Dolt at bay was struggling against something more than a
mere blindness."</p>

<p>He paused, but before I had thought of something to say, he
concluded, "So you see, I had to give up political action to face up to
this fundamental problem. Otherwise I might do more harm than
good."</p>

<p>Victor had finished mending the iron, and was clearing up his tools.
While he was out of the room I noticed that Maggie's hands lay idle,
and that she was gazing with wide and glistening eyes at the empty
grate. Uncomfortably I felt that she was not far from tears. I did not
like to question her; but in the light of future events it seems well
to record this little incident. Suddenly she rose, and went out, saying
that we all deserved a cup of tea.</p>

<p>While I was thinking over all that Victor had said, he returned and
settled into an easy chair. I remarked that he must find Maggie a great
source of strength. He answered quietly, "I cannot live without her. I
cannot. Without her I should soon die into the Dolt for ever." I
protested that, after ail, he had been himself before ever he met
Maggie "Yes," he said. "Those early spontaneous flashes of awakeness
maintained themselves; and indeed they increased, as though I were
gradually strengthening my hold. But now-well, I am beginning to wonder
whether growing old doesn't favour the Dolt." Suddenly he turned an
earnest face toward me, and said, "It's Maggie I am anxious about. Of
course I used to care frightfully on my own account about being my real
self, but now, well, I don't much mind really for myself. But I do care
very much for Maggie's sake. She'd be in such a hole if the Dolt took
over permanently. And she'd be so distressed for me. I sometimes feel
terrified for her. (And this terror itself means I am not quite awake.)
Yet I know it was right to link up with her. It was the way of life for
both of us. Then there's another thing. Of course it was glorious for
both of us that she was able to rescue me from the Dolt; and it's good
that we both need each other so much, and that each quickens the other
so much; but it's bad that I should depend on her for my very
existence. For both our sakes I must be able to stand permanently on my
own feet."</p>

<p>At this moment Maggie returned with the tea-tray. Glancing at it, he
said, in his most Oxford accent "Waitress! That cake's a bought one. I
shall complain to the management, and you'll be dismissed." She
laughed. "Complain, if you like, sir." she said, in her most outlandish
speech. "But I'm marrying the management."</p>

<p>Over our tea I led Victor back to his story. I asked whether he had
made any progress in getting his foundations clear since the clash with
the Communists. "I think so," he said. "Of course, in a way the problem
is simple enough. Something or other blinds the Dolt to a whole aspect
of experience which is clear to me. But what is it that blinds him? Is
it just a strong physiological mechanism that invariably comes into
action at the critical moment, a kind of reflex shutting of the eyes
whenever they turn in a certain direction? If so, would some drug or
other break the reflex, and so destroy the fictitious personality, and
keep me permanently in the field? Or is that whole theory too simple.
Then is there some psychological method or technique that would do the
trick? I made enquiries about drugs, but got nowhere. Then I tried the
mystics, eastern and western."</p>

<p>He fell silent, munching the bought cake.</p>

<p>Presently he said, "I haven't got my mind clear about mysticism yet,
and perhaps I never shall. But if I had to make a sort of interim
report, it would run something like this. (Make yourself comfortable.
Have some more cake, though it's only a sort of ersatz of the real
Maggie cake.) And fortify yourself to listen to a lecture."</p>

<p>At the risk of overburdening the reader, I must give a rather full
report of Victor's comments on mysticism at this stage of his life. For
his attitude on this subject seems to me significant for understanding
his whole character. It is not easy for me whose mind is so pedestrian,
to do justice to his views, because I cannot accept them without grave
reservations. But I must do my best.</p>

<p>After Victor had continued for some time to sip his tea in silence,
he said. "First, it is obvious that the great mystics had something
enormously important to say. Second, they could only say it in human
language and in terms of contemporary thought and values. And, as they
themselves insist, human thought and language are far too clumsy for
the task. Third, in their cultural environment, and with their
contemporary thought, it was impossible for them to recognize that any
statements about ultimate reality must be overwhelmingly more false
than true. Consequently, in spite of their insistence on the
ineffability of God, and so on, they persist in making far-reaching
statements in the faith that they may be more true than false. They
claim that in some significant sense they come into a special relation
with 'God' or the 'Whole' or 'Reality', or what-not. Well, I believe
that all such statements, taken in the sense in which they were
intended, are completely unreliable. But, fourth, taken in another
sense, simply as statements about the nature of consciousness or
individuality, in relation to the depth behind depth of objective
reality, they are often profoundly true. I mean: though it is utterly
beyond our power to know whether consciousness is or is not at the
heart of all things, it is quite possible for us to be wakened somewhat
beyond our ordinary somnolent mundane level of awareness, so as to see
or feel a little deeper into objective reality than we normally do. My
own special case proves this rather strikingly; but really there is
plenty of evidence of it in ordinary experience. The mystics have very
much help to give us in this venture of deepening our awareness. Fifth,
very roughly, what they tell us on this subject is this. Man cannot
'save' himself, cannot wake to a higher level of experience simply by
the will to do so, on the part of his normal mundane self. Something
other than his normal self must help him, must in some sense invade
him, kill his normal individualistic self, and so possess him that he
becomes a new kind of self, with new experience, new desires, a
completely new orientation. The mystics say that this something other
is 'God' or 'Reality' or the 'Whole'; but to say this sort of thing is
to forget the limitations of human understanding. All that can
legitimately be said is that something other than his normal self must
intrude within his consciousness, with shattering effect upon his
normal self, killing it, and creating a new self. This is the
justification of all the talk about 'self-naughting', self-
destruction, self-transcendence, and so on. Beyond this claim about
something intruding, one other statement can safely be made. It is a
statement implied in all that the mystics say. The 'something' that
intrudes presents itself simly as a sphere of objective reality
hitherto ignored, a wider, deeper, more subtle sphere; or better, not a
distinct sphere at all but a whole system of new aspects of familiar
reality. So to speak, all familiar things are transfigured by a new
illumination, so that one experiences them more fully, more deeply, and
discovers in them new kinds of value, hitherto unsuspected; much as the
child wakes up from the purely animal values to discover the values of
personality, in himself and others."</p>

<p>The lecture seemed to be finished. Victor concentrated on his food.
I remarked that his attitude to mysticism seemed to me an ingenious
attempt to have the cake and eat it. To accept the validity of mystical
experience and yet deny the mystic's claim to have some sort of contact
with God, or ultimate reality, seemed too clever by half. With his
mouth full, Victor said merely, "All new ideas seem at first too clever
by half. But this one works. It's true to the actual experience."</p>

<p>At this point I queried, "You claim, do you, to have actually had
the actual experience? With so many modern mystics one can never be
sure that they speak from their own' experience and not merely from
their reading of mystical classics." Victor answered cautiously,
"Naturally I don't really know what actual experience the great mystics
really had; but certainly I myself have actually experienced something
which is the guiding star of my life. Indeed, so long as I am fully
myself, I am constantly experiencing it. When I begin to lose it, I
know the Dolt is in the offing, and I must discipline myself."</p>

<p>I was not yet satisfied, so I challenged him again. "You have it
constantly, you say. Now for instance?" He answered promptly, "Yes,
now. While I am talking to you I am compellingly aware of our universal
setting. Not only do I feel us as little individual members of this
planet's gropingly intelligent species, surrounded by a formidable
pregnant cosmos of galaxies, but also I am constantly, though
obscurely, aware of my fundamental identity with you and all personal
beings, through the underlying ground of all being. Is that definite
enough?"</p>

<p>I could not make much of this; but I took careful notes of our
conversation, and subsequently Victor himself vetted them.</p>

<p>As he seemed to have settled once more into silence, I stimulated
him again by asking him to tell me how all this bore on politics.
"Well," he said, "the bearing is rather depressing. Granting that
political action is necessary, how is it to be kept sweet? Not,
certainly, by the Communist method of sacrificing everything to
immediate political opportunism. But, on the other hand, not, as the
mystically-inclined sometimes think, by the withdrawal of the best
people away from the field of political action so that they can
peacefully contemplate the 'Whole'. Somehow the political leaders must
themselves be contemplatives, up to a point; to keep them true to the
spirit. But how can they? Politics is a whole-time job. And so is
religious contemplation. Moreover, so long as the masses are what they
are, that sort of leader will never gain power. The masses themselves
live on too low level of experience to care at all deeply and
constantly for the spirit. But the Revolution, some sort of drastic
social change, becomes increasingly urgent. The only hope is that the
leaders and the masses will be a little more clearly aware of the
spirit than they have been in the past. Really we are in a dilemma. We
can't get the true Revolution without a general rise in spiritual
awareness; but we can't have that until the Revolution has abolished
some of the conditions that fix people's attention on individualistic
power-lust or on herd passions."</p>

<p>Again he paused, but soon continued, "And now one final point,
concerning me personally." I saw his eyes meet Maggie's. He continued,
"I see now that, for me at any rate, there are no short cuts, no
special technique for securing my position against the Dolt. At present
I am maintained against him largely by Maggie's power, by something
which is in a way magical or in a way like prayer. My own native power
or responsiveness to the spirit is no longer quite what it was.
Probably I shall never fully regain that youthful sensitivity. So I
must compensate for its loss by more earnest and continuous attention
to the objective vision of the spirit, which distinguishes me from the
Dolt. Here ends my second lecture."</p>

<p>He handed his cup to Maggie to be refilled.</p>

<p>Little more happened before I left the Smiths next morning. I hoped
to see them again before leaving for India, but we did not succeed in
arranging a meeting. My general impression of Victor's condition was
that, in spite of his sense of psychological insecurity, he was really
very firmly established, and indeed on the threshold of a triumphant
career.</p>

<p>While I was in India I received an occasional letter from Victor
telling me odds and ends about his work, speaking of articles he had
written, books he hoped to write, and people he had met. Then came a
letter announcing that the couple had been legally married, and then
the news that Maggie had borne a son, and that both were doing well.
This was followed by increasingly rare letters, in many of which the
child figured a good deal. Evidently Victor was taking parenthood very
seriously. In one of his letters, he said, "Children must be allowed to
develop in their own way, of course, and learn their own lessons; but
one tries to help them to avoid some of one's own mistakes. Probably
one nevertheless treats them unwittingly all wrong in some way or
other, so that they develop a set of troubles all their own."</p>

<p>Before closing my account of this period of Victor's life I had
better mention a matter about which I did not learn till long
afterwards, when I returned to England. Quite early in their married
life Maggie had been made seriously anxious lest Victor's continued
interest in other young women should lead sooner or later to
distressing complications. Victor assured her that his inveterate habit
of falling in love with any girl that was specially attractive to him
could not lessen his feeling for her. But inevitably she felt insecure;
and jealous, in spite of her modern theories. She was tormented by the
fear that from one of these light-hearted relations with other women
some serious attachment would arise. It seemed to her that they must
spring from some inadequacy in herself. Evidently she could not
permanently satisfy her husband. This idea Victor vehemently rejected.
He said (so Maggie told me) "For me you are, and always will be, the
dearest, in fact the very best of all possible mates. But, damn it, I
won't blind myself to other women! And you must not blind yourself to
other men. Of course, of course, monogamy, the single life-long
partnership, is the only way to fullness of love; but don't you see,
don't you feel, that If monogamy excludes every other attraction, If it
turns-well, monastic, it may miss fullness of love after all." Then he
added, garbling a famous quotation, "Besides, I could not love thee,
dear, so much, loved I not other girls quite a lot."</p>

<p>Honesty compels me to record that Victor's behaviour in this matter
seemed to me rather heartless and irresponsible. Even if he did know
that his attachment to Maggie was unshakable, she had every reason to
be distressed; and surely it was cruel and selfish to let her suffer.
When I said this to Victor, he replied emphatically that for both their
sakes he was justified in these occasional loves. For himself, he was
justified because they quickened him (so he said) spiritually for his
work, and because they did actually deepen his love for his wife. And
on Maggie's account too he was justified because (he insisted) only in
such experience, however painfully, could she learn the truth about
him, and about herself, and about love.</p>

<p>Well, this all sounded to me rather specious. Yet I find I have to
reserve judgment. I have no illusion that Victor was perfect, even in
his most lucid state; but so often he has proved himself far more
sensitive than my very commonplace self! As for Maggie, she claims that
she now entirely approves of Victor's conduct. But then, she was always
too forgiving.</p>

<h2>10 - CHECK</h2>

<h4>From 1929 to 1939</h4>

<p>IN 1933, I RECEIVED a long and distressing letter from Maggie.
Victor had relapsed into the Dolt condition. The following account is
based on her letter, and on subsequent conversations with her and with
Victor, when I returned to England in the spring of 1939.</p>

<p>Victor had been very busy with his adult education work, and at the
end of the winter he was definitely over-tired. At this time Maggie had
gone down with a bad attack of gastric flu. Victor had given up
everything to nurse her and look after the child, who by the way had
been named Colin. Shortly after Maggie was once more on her feet,
Victor himself succumbed to the disease. He had an extremely bad
attack, and his recovery was slow. The change of personality had
occurred while he was still confined to his bed.</p>

<p>Maggie was actually sitting with him at the time. He had been rather
sluggish and despondent during the day, but Maggie had supposed this to
be a natural symptom of convalescence. She was sewing. Colin, now over
two years old, was playing on his father's bed.</p>

<p>Maggie asked a question which Victor failed to answer. She looked up
from her sewing, and was startled to see him staring at her with an
expression of bewilderment and horror. At this point Colin clambered
along from the foot of the bed to play with his father. Apparently he
thought the expression of repugnance on his father's face was all in
the game, for he laughed. Victor cried sharply, "Take the child away!"
and pushed the still laughing Colin toward Maggie. She seized the
wriggling and cheerful creature and held him to her. Victor started to
get out of bed. She said, "Don't get out, dear, you're not really
strong yet." He stood up, then fell back exhausted. He stood again, and
demanded his clothes. She tried to persuade him to lie down. He cried
out, "Don't touch me. Kindly leave the room." She hesitated, and slowly
moved toward the door. Meanwhile the exertion of opening a drawer
convinced the Dolt that he had better go back to bed. He crawled
dejectedly between the sheets.</p>

<p>So it happened that the unfortunate Dolt had to stay in bed and be
nursed by the ugly waitress. She, of course, had known at once what had
happened to Victor, and she heroically determined that she would turn
the disaster into some sort of a triumph. The Dolt himself also knew
vaguely what had happened; but he needed to know more. "You had better
stay," he said in a voice that was meant to be haughty but sounded
merely querulous. "You had better tell me what has happened. All I can
remember is, being in my father's house. He is Sir Geoffrey
Cadogan-Smith."</p>

<p>Maggie found herself regarding the Dolt as still essentially Victor,
though Victor very sick. She felt none of the distaste that the true
Victor himself felt for his secondary personality. Maggie longed to put
her arms round Victor and comfort him, but she realized that this would
be a grave tactical error.</p>

<p>She returned to the chair beside the bed, still holding the child.
She said, "You have had a very bad attack of flu, and now you're--not
quite yourself." He asked her how long it was since he was with his
father. She hesitated, then said, "A very long time, in fact about ten
years." The Dolt was visibly distressed. He said, "Where am I now? Why
are you here? You're a waitress, not a nurse. I remember you."</p>

<p>"Victor, dear," she said, "this is your home, and I am Maggie, your
wife, and we love one another very much, and this is our little boy,
Colin." He looked at her with perplexity and revulsion, then at the
child, then about the room. There was a long silence. Then Victor said,
"As soon as I am fit I shall go home to my father: I will see that you
are provided for."</p>

<p>"But Victor, darling," she said ruefully, "this is the only home you
have now. And we have been so happy. Can't you remember any of it?"</p>

<p>He looked at her blankly, then enquired, "Is my father dead?" To her
affirmative nod he responded with a sigh rather of exasperation than of
grief.</p>

<p>For ten days Maggie nursed the Dolt in his bed. Then he got up; and
remained in the house for about a week more. Maggie behaved with the
utmost devotion, without ever claiming his affection. She hoped thus in
time to win his love, even if he remained the Dolt. But she seemed to
make no impression. At last he announced that he would leave next day,
and nothing she could say dissuaded him. He went through all his
possessions, packed all his clothes, and gathered all the lecture notes
and other manuscripts into a pile. Maggie discovered that he intended
to burn these in the garden. Suddenly she flared up in indignation,
upbraided the startled Dolt for a heartless, spiteful half-wit, and
carried away the bundle to lock it in a cupboard. This incident seems
to have impressed the Dolt. He could not help noticing that the woman
had abandoned her usual sweetness only for the sake of his interest, or
what she conceived to be his interest.</p>

<p>The Dolt departed. Maggie was greatly distressed, but she had put a
cheerful face on it, and told him she felt sure he would come back
soon. She then reverted to her supposed telepathic powers, seeking from
afar to wake him to his true self. This she did by trying to make him
feel her presence, vividly and constantly, and to rouse in him memories
of their past happiness together. She also tried (but this task she
felt to be far more difficult) to flood him with that "vision of the
spirit" which he himself had formerly tried to impart to her.</p>

<p>After a few days she made enquiries at the bank, and learned that he
had drawn a large sum, shifted his account to another town, and left no
address. But he had arranged for her to draw a small amount weekly from
the old bank.</p>

<p>The Dolt stayed away for about a month. I learned later from the
awake Victor that he had spent the time in a rather expensive hotel in
the seaport city of his former business career. At first he was
entirely absorbed in trying to establish contact with his business
acquaintances. He had little success. His hope of finding his way back
into the shipping office came to nothing. He was forced to begin
looking for some other job, but nothing attractive came his way.</p>

<p>Gradually he began to feel strangely divided against himself. He
remained still the Dolt, in that all events of his awake phases were
still inaccessible to him; but he was no longer wholly satisfied with
his Doltish values. He had a vague yearning for something different
from the triumphs of a successful business man. Even Maggie, though
still physically unattractive to him, he remembered with something like
affection, or at least with a self-centred yearning to be loved by her,
or someone. The feeling of loneliness and futility became intolerable,
and hotel life repugnant. Also, he realized that he could not afford
such expensive accommodation with no income in prospect.</p>

<p>At last he wrote to Maggie to say that he would be returning next
day, "to discuss certain matters with her".</p>

<p>He arrived in a taxi, with all his luggage. She opened the front
door to him, and was ready to fall into his arms, but a single glance
told her that he was still the Dolt. In spite of his Doltish condition,
she could gladly have hugged him, but instead she offered a hand, which
he took without emotion.</p>

<p>There followed a strange phase in which Victor alternated between
standing on his Doltish dignity and allowing the kindly influence of
Maggie and of home life and the irrepressibly friendly Colin to soak
more and more deeply into him. Maggie treated him as a guest in the
little house, fearful lest too much domesticity should repel him. He
occupied the spare room, and took no part in the housework, nor in the
care of Colin. Much of his time was spent in solitary walks; but much
also in talks with Maggie about their common past. She was determined
to rebuild little by little the whole fabric of his lost experience.
But, do what she would, she could not change it from mere reported
history to living memory. After recounting some incident or other,
connected perhaps with his work or the upbringing of the child, she
would appeal, "Don't you remember?" But he would always shake his head,
either impatiently or sadly. Once she dared to allude to some amatory
incident dear to the awakened Victor. But the Dolt at once "went into
his shell". Henceforth she carefully refrained from mentioning such
things.</p>

<p>A good deal of the Dolt's time was spent in the little study,
reading Victor's books. One day, with diffidence, he asked Maggie to
let him see the notes which he had wanted to destroy. He said, "Let me
read them in the evenings, when you can watch me all the time, in
case--I should lose my head and want to destroy them." Maggie agreed.
She also produced the manuscript of Victor's still unfinished book.
With more concentration than understanding the Dolt tackled this work,
while Maggie sat sewing. Now and then he would ask her to explain ideas
that were unfamiliar to him, and she would try to reproduce the
explanations that the true Victor had formerly, given to her. Sometimes
he came on passages in which scorn of "the doltish mentality" was
frankly expressed. Gradually the Dolt realized that these passages were
in a way directed against himself. On one occasion he was so upset that
he angrily tore the page; and then, seeing Maggie's outraged
expression, he set about carefully mending it with transparent adhesive
tape.</p>

<p>The summer was advancing. Inevitably the time was coming when
normally Victor would be returning to his winter classes. Already he
had been approached with regard to lecturing at a summer school. It was
very difficult for him to refuse, but impossible to accept, as of
course the Dolt was entirely unequipped. He had been forced to excuse
himself on grounds of health. Maggie had privately informed the
authorities that he had suffered another breakdown, but was recovering,
and would probably be ready for his winter's work.</p>

<p>The change in the Dolt's temper had gone so far that he was now
positively interested in the work and the character of the other
personality. At first this interest was resentful and hostile, but
little by little he came to recognize, though grudgingly, the values
sacred to the other; and began also seriously to consider carrying on
the other's work. The task would be formidable, because he had lost all
knowledge of the subjects to be dealt with, and all recollection of the
students. However, he announced his intention of tackling the job, with
Maggie's help. She, of course, promised to do her utmost. The task
would have been quite impossible but for one fortunate fact, not
uncommon, I am told, in cases of multiple personality. Victor was able
to relearn the old material very quickly. Similarly in the matter of
students, Maggie was able, with the aid of a group-photograph of a
festive gathering, to restore much of his knowledge of the
personalities with whom he would be dealing. But in spite of his facile
relearning of material that had been formerly acquired by the true
Victor, the Dolt was not nearly as quick as the true Victor at picking
up new facts; and he soon discovered that many of the awake
personality's most original ideas were almost incomprehensible to him.
At first he was inclined to regard this as a sign that the other was
after all mentally unbalanced or deranged. But talks with Maggie forced
him to revise his opinion. Over and over again she was able to pass on
to him the insight which the awake Victor had passed on to her.</p>

<p>Little by little a queer ambivalent relation developed between the
Dolt and Maggie. More and more he became dependent on her. More and
more he respected her, and even in an obscure way cared for her. But
his affection was rather filial than marital. Physically she remained
unattractive to him, or even repellent. She on her side was constantly
exasperated not only by his intellectual inferiority to the true Victor
but also by his emotional obtuseness. His affection, such as it was,
was little more than a sentimental adulation of his dear nurse, his
substitute mother. Indeed, though at first she had felt toward the Dolt
as toward Victor sick, little by little she became conscious of a
serious conflict in her heart between her identification of the Dolt
with the true Victor and her dissatisfaction with the Dolt himself.
Desperately she longed for the true Victor; increasingly she pitied and
despised, and yet conscientiously mothered, the Doltish substitute. Yet
physically the Dolt was identical with her own cherished man, and his
physical coldness toward her constantly distressed her. The Dolt, it
seemed, required of her only maternal tenderness and service. But her
maternal feelings, were all for Colin. Yet the Dolt was indeed Victor.
She still clung to the hope that some day he would wake again; and
secretly she assiduously used all her supposed "magical" powers to
restore her husband to his right mind. This she could never succeed in
doing; but she inclined to believe that the steady improvement in the
Dolt's own character was due to her paranormal influence.</p>

<p>At last the time came for Victor to start his winter classes. Maggie
had privately warned his colleagues and some of his students that he
was not yet fully himself, but she assured them that he was fit for
work. She was confident that this was true, for she had carefully
coached him, and he had very earnestly set himself to the task of
mastering the work that was formerly so familiar to his other self. He
faced his students with courage; and, apart from occasional "lapses of
memory" and muddled presentation, he was academically proficient. But
he had lost much of his old brilliance as a teacher, and he was far
more easily tired and exasperated than the Victor that his students had
formerly known. I took the trouble at a later stage to enquire from
some of his students about their feelings toward Victor at this time.
They had gradually discovered that his temperament had changed.
Formerly everyone had found him exceptionally easy to make contact
with, but now there was a barrier. They felt that he sincerely tried to
overcome it, but it was always present. As one woman put the matter,
"Mr. Smith's great gift in the old days was that he knew at once what
you wanted, often better than you did yourself. But after his illness
he lost this power. He never seemed able to realize you."</p>

<p>One other important event took place during my absence in India,
namely the birth of a second child. Not till 1939, when I returned to
England on holiday, did I see the Smiths again.</p>

<p>This time it was Maggie who received me. Victor was away at a class,
but would be back that night. I noticed at once that: she had aged a
good deal. Her ruddy hair was as voluminous as ever, but its lustre had
diminished; and age or anxiety had produced a few white threads. The
eyes, I thought, had a new tenderness and sadness. They were surrounded
by a filigree of little creases. The wide mouth was more severely
moulded; and the lips were slightly drawn back, as though from a sour
taste.</p>

<p>As Maggie was leading me up to my room, Colin appeared. He was a
well- grown boy of eight. His features owed much to Victor, but the
mouth was a youthful version of Maggie's, and his hair showed a ruddy
glint. He greeted me without shyness, but with an obvious reserve.
Later I learned that early experiences of his father had made him form
a habit of approaching all men with reserve.</p>

<p>When I had deposited my baggage in my room, Maggie led me to see her
younger child, Sheila, who had just been put to bed. She was now about
three. She lay in her cot with very wide-awake blue eyes and a mop of
fair hair. Unlike Colin, she at once greeted me with a genial smile.
Having come into the world later than her brother, she had missed the
period of her father's erratic behaviour toward his offspring.</p>

<p>We then went downstairs to share a high tea with Colin; and when he
had gone off to bed, Maggie settled to her sewing, and told me all the
family news. Victor, she said, was generally in the less-awake state.
(Maggie, I noticed, never used the label "Dolt", which Victor awake had
invented for his secondary personality.) There were only occasional
brief wakings into the true Victor. To Maggie these spells were very
poignant, because when they occurred Victor treated her with great
tenderness and ardour. With a wry smile, she said, "You see, I have my
own darling Victor for a few days every two or three months. The rest
of the time I have an unsatisfactory substitute, who does not love me,
does not really seem to know how to love anyone. He generally treats me
with sentimental respect. In the early days he sometimes gave me a bad
time; but he has come to need me in a lot of ways, and sometimes (I
think) he begins to feel a trace of affection for me. But now and then
he swings over into dislike, and--well, sometimes life becomes a bit
difficult."</p>

<p>On the rare occasions when the true Victor awoke, he found his life
in chaos. The Dolt was not the gifted teacher that Victor's students
had known and admired. So far as actual knowledge of his subjects was
concerned, he was by now tolerably efficient, with the aid of the awake
Victor's notes and his own respectable "First-Class Honours"
intelligence. But he was not nearly so good as Victor either at
inspiring people with the will to understand and to work, or at helping
them over difficulties. And he was erratic; sometimes painstaking,
sometimes careless and contemptuous. The result was that attendance at
his classes was not nearly so satisfactory as it had been.
Consequently, in the sole class where the secretary's loyalty to the
class was greater than his moral scruple, a good deal of falsification
of the registers had been indulged in. The Dolt connived at this,
although it amounted to a rather serious acquiescence in obtaining
money from the State on false pretences. When the awake Victor appeared
at a class, he found himself in a very awkward position. It was
necessary to contradict a good deal of the Dolt's teaching; and also,
in the one class there were difficulties over the register. It was
taken for granted that he approved of the mildly dishonest practices
that had become customary. Once or twice he had made a fuss, and this
unexpected behaviour had caused much soreness.</p>

<p>On the occasions when the true Victor had taken a class, he used to
tell Maggie in detail about the session, so that she could pass on the
information to the Dolt. Sometimes he actually wrote a letter to his
other self, informing him of the steps taken to defeat his
malpractices. These letters he used to address ironically (though
correctly) to "Captain J.V. Cadogan-Smith, M.C., M.A." It amused him to
begin them "Dear Cad", and to sign them "Your better half, Vic Smith".
I learned later that when the Dolt had treated Maggie extremely badly,
and the true Victor had presently appeared, he wrote a witheringly
contemptuous letter to his other self, ending "I warn you! If you can't
treat my wife decently, I may be forced to put a bullet through our
common head."</p>

<p>In other ways, also, Victor's affairs were in confusion. It was
quite impossible for him to carryon those "spiritual researches" which
were to have been his special contribution to the life of his society.
This work was now impossible for two reasons. First, though the Dolt
had read the true Victor's unfinished book and other papers with
increasing interest, he was quite incapable of the kind of experience
which had given rise to it. Consequently it was only in the brief
spells of his lucidity that Victor could make any progress either in
what he called "spiritual research", or in writing. But in another way
also the work was rendered impossible. The awake Victor himself was no
longer capable of the clarity of experience that it demanded. The Dolt
did not keep the common body and mind in strict training, did not keep
his appetites under control, and his attention constantly upon such
vision as was possible to him. Sometimes he did make serious attempts
to do this; but all too soon he would lapse. Consequently when the
awake Victor appeared, he inherited a sort of hang-over. Neither mind
nor body were keyed up to concert pitch. Nothing less than several
months of clean living and continuous meditation could possibly fit him
for his work. And such a spell was never allowed him. The task which he
had most at heart seemed to have become permanently impossible.</p>

<p>There was yet another source of distress for the awake Victor. The
Dolt had begun to exploit such wisdom as the true Victor had already
expressed in his unfinished book. For the less awake personality did
not wish to remain indefinitely in adult education. Though he had by
now been seriously influenced by the true Victor's values, he looked
for something more spectacular and more lucrative than lecturing in
evening classes. So he planned to write a number of popular books based
on the philosophical and religious ideas of the awake personality,
rashly confident that he had understood those ideas, and that he could
even improve on them by making them more intelligible and less
extravagant. The first book was to be a novel about a modern mystic who
alternated between otherworldliness and participation in public life.
He had already written most of this book. The awake Victor, who of
course inherited the "memory" of the Dolt's actual writing of the book,
and had also scrutinized it afresh after his waking, was bitterly
contemptuous of this garbled version of his thought. He recognized that
the Dolt had carried out his plan with considerable skill. Indeed, he
feared that the novel might actually turn out to be a best seller, and
its author might earn a spurious reputation for profound religious
experience and literary artistry. But to the awake Victor the book was
subtly false through and through. He could not tolerate the prospect of
being saddled with responsibility for what he regarded as a glib and
insincere work.</p>

<p>At a later date, I asked Victor to throw some light on the
difference between his own ideas and the Dolt's interpretation of them.
He answered with a long disquisition, most of which was almost
meaningless to me. He would expound some conception of his own, and
then give the Dolt's version of it, ending contemptuously with, "You
surely see how he messed up the whole thing." In one case, however, I
did gain some notion of his point. In his manuscript the true Victor
had devoted much space to careful study of the distinctively human
personal relationship of fellowship or community. He had described it
realistically in terms of self-awareness and other-awareness and the
creation of a psychical "symbiosis", in which each individual becomes
necessary to and is moulded by the other. The Dolt, I gather, had
interpreted this to mean that a common spirit or soul emerged, with a
life of its own over and above the life of the individual. The true
Victor was infuriated by this "sentimental and romantic notion". And
his own distress dismayed him, for the very fact that he could not
maintain serene detachment seemed to indicate that he himself had
gravely deteriorated.</p>

<p>The Dolt had kept his book secret from Maggie, perhaps vaguely
feeling that she would disapprove of it. But of course, when the true
Victor reappeared, he told her all about it, and showed it to her. He
then announced that he would destroy the manuscript. But Maggie begged
for its life, for to her it did not seem so base an imitation as to
Victor himself; and she felt (so she told me) that drastic criticism
would be more appropriate than destruction. In her view, even if the
work was over-simplified and crude, and partly insincere, it also gave
evidence of a quite sincere groping after truth. Might not her poor
somnolent Victor clarify his mind in the writing of this book? And
might not she, if she was sufficiently tactful, help him by passing on
to him the comments of the lucid Victor? Might she not persuade him to
rewrite it on a higher level of experience?</p>

<p>Maggie confessed to another motive. It was desperately important for
her to gain the complete confidence of the unhappy secondary
personality with whom she had to spend most of her life. She therefore
wanted to be able to tell him that she had saved his book from
destruction.</p>

<p>In the end her policy was agreed upon. Victor himself wrote an
outspoken criticism of the book, and entrusted it to Maggie. She
promised that, after due preparation of the author's mind, she would
show him the devastating comments of the true Victor. The Dolt's book
was never published, never even completed. Criticism on the part of the
true Victor combined with a gradual change in the Dolt's own outlook to
disgust him with his literary ventures.</p>

<p>Maggie made it clear to me that the less awake Victor was divided
against himself. He was sometimes quite sincerely and earnestly
concerned to follow as nearly as possible in the path set by the awake
Victor, though well aware that he could never attain to the other's
sensitivity and constancy of purpose. But often he rebelled; though
never, so to speak, fundamentally. Formerly, the completely
unregenerate Dolt had been determined to live a kind of life entirely
different from that chosen by the awake Victor, a life of go-getting,
self-display and individualistic enjoyment. But by now he was at heart
orientated (though unclearly orientated) toward a different kind of
life; and his rebelliousness, though often violent, was only a
spasmodic kicking against the pricks and over the traces, with no clear
alternative to the aims which he had grown to accept from his more
lucid self. In fact he had in many ways greatly improved as a person.
On the other hand, when he did revolt he could no longer revert to the
respectable and efficient business man; and consequently he was at
these times completely disorientated, disillusioned and disheartened.
And so he was apt to fall for every passing temptation.</p>

<p>"For one thing," said Maggie, putting her sewing aside and clasping
her hands tightly together in obvious distress, "at those times he is
apt to drink far too much. And of course that makes him worse. There
have been complaints of his lecturing in a fuddled state. If he doesn't
stop this sort of thing, he will lose his job, sooner or later. It's
tragic. You see, his lapses are not very frequent, but they do so much
harm. Normally my poor substitute Victor is all too respectable, and
very conscientious up to a point. He really does want to make good.
It's not his fault that he can't be really original or brilliant.
(Though, mind you, he is just as intelligent as ever, in his own
conventional way.) It's not his fault that he doesn't love me, and yet
uncomfortably worships me. And all the while, you see, I know he is
really at heart still Victor, my own glorious Victor; and so I easily
forgive him, and in spite of everything I love him, and I just wait
longingly for him to wake and be himself again. But, oh, dear, it's so
distressing when he breaks out; and even more so when the bout is over,
and he is abjectly ashamed." She paused, then added, near to tears, "He
would hate me for telling you all this. But my own Victor wouldn't.
Indeed he would want me to tell you. And it's a relief to be able to
talk to someone about it all."</p>

<p>I asked Maggie what she had meant by saying that he had sometimes
treated her badly; and I added that the awake Victor would want her to
tell me. She took up her sewing again, and concentrated her attention
on it. After a long silence, all she said was, "Oh, he just hates me
and gets angry, and says horrid things, and sometimes does horrid
things too." She was evidently reluctant to tell me more, and I did not
press her.</p>

<p>Presently she said, "A little while ago he bought a sports car,
though we really can't afford it. He spends a lot of time rushing about
in it. He has always been a very good driver, you know; and doing trips
in record time gives him a boyish delight. He generally manages to
motor to his classes; and the night-driving amuses him. Once or twice
he has taken me in the car for a week-end. It means making arrangements
with a friend to come and stay here with the children. And, of course,
that is sometimes difficult. And often he changes his mind when the
arrangements have been made. Anyhow those week-ends never go properly.
I get bored in a car; I prefer walking. And he hates walking, and wants
to spend all the time in the car. So we go far afield, and never have
any time to walk when we get there. Besides," she added with a nervous
laugh, "he insists on having separate bedrooms at the hotels. On one
occasion he started a bit of painfully false love-making on the
journey. But it was too awful, and we both turned to ice. It seems so
utterly fantastic for that to happen between me and Victor. You see,
deep down under his revulsion from me he does really love me. I know he
does. And I think he knows it too, but he won't face up to it. The
loathing always wins. Sometimes he seems to love the car far more than
me. When he is not driving it, he is always fiddling about with it. On
one of the rare visits of my own Victor, we used the car to take us all
to Patterdale. Of course Victor and I made a bit of a honeymoon of it.
On the second day the other reappeared, and of course he was furious to
find himself sharing a room with me; and furious also because the car
(he said) had been overloaded He insisted on my taking the children
back by train at once."</p>

<p>I asked Maggie if she felt sure that things really were improving,
or the reverse. She said, "My true Victor comes no more often; but on
the whole I do think the other is more reconciled to his life, and to
me. Also he is more interested in the children than he used to be. He
used to say, 'They're not my brats, and I don't see why I should bother
about them '."</p>

<p>I inferred that Sheila, who had been born since the Dolt had ousted
the true Victor, had been conceived during one of the rare awake phases
of her father's strange life.</p>

<p>Maggie continued, "I feel somehow that if only I could win him
emotionally, things might be much better. But he still finds me
repulsive. Most men have always thought me just ugly, but he finds me
repulsive." She suddenly rose, saying she must put the kettle on, as
Victor would be back soon.</p>

<p>While I was thinking over Maggie's story, there was the sound of a
car stopping at the gate, and Maggie went to let Maggie in. She brought
him straight into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry, old man!" he said. "Glad to see you again at last."
Victor greeted me with formal politeness, and a pathetic attempt at the
lordly condescension of former days. I was shocked by his appearance.
Not only was his hair much greyer (so, no doubt, was mine), but his
face had gone flabby. The heavy eyelids half covered the eyes, in the
manner typical of the Dolt; but occasionally they were raised in a
disconcerting and exaggerated stare, as though in caricature of the
true Victor.</p>

<p>There was an awkward little pause. I said something about being glad
to see him again after all these years. "Years and years," he said,
"and we both show it, me with my hair falling out, and you with that
dried-up leathery face of the East." We both laughed. He said, "Do you
remember how I had to valet you when you were my best man?" His voice
faded out. It was as though he had forgotten and suddenly remembered
that though (as the Dolt) he had not seen me since the wedding fiasco,
the true Victor had since met me in London and had a long conversation.
I tactfully laughed, and tried to think of something to say.</p>

<p>Victor had his supper from a tray, sitting by the fire. He kept up a
flow of desultory talk, and I interjected an occasional platitude. I
vaguely felt that we were both manoeuvring for position. When he had
finished his meal, and Maggie had gone out to wash up, he said, "I
suppose you think the other Victor is the true Victor, and that I am
only a feeble and perverted imitation." I was never any good at tact,
and now I squirmed and stammered. Before I could say anything, he
continued.</p>

<p>"You're wrong. The other me is a brilliant but hopelessly unbalanced
and extravagant creature. I have not his imaginative power, but I am
balanced, sane. In fact I am the true synthesis of him and the
practical go-getter that I used to be."</p>

<p>Taken aback, I could find no better comment than, "That's very
interesting."</p>

<p>Victor looked at me shrewdly for a moment, then remarked, "Maggie
has been talking to you. She's a wonderful woman, in spite of her
looks, poor thing; but she has got me all wrong. Just because I am not
sexually attracted to her, she thinks I cannot be as sensitive as the
bloke she married. Her trouble is that she can't keep her mind clear of
sex. I suppose it's inevitable in an unattractive woman. Not that
Maggie is simply unattractive. Long acquaintance with her reveals a
most disturbing animal or diabolic power that one has increasingly to
guard against."</p>

<p>At this point, noticing perhaps that I was showing signs of protest,
he hastened to add, "But, as I say, in her own way she really is
magnificent. She's devoted to me. If it had not been for her, I should
never have discovered that my other self had anything good in him at
all. She has been an invaluable liaison officer. She has helped me a
lot to see things from his point of view. She has helped me to begin
synthesizing the two of us. Take politics, for instance. He is a wild
sort of Communist, and I used to be a rather conventional Tory. Well,
with Maggie's help I have progressed a lot, and now I think I have
really found the balanced view. At heart I am a kind of Liberal
Socialist, but I am practical enough to see that the right road to
socialism is through enlightened conservatism. My other I self, with
his Marxism, is far too impatient to accept this position."</p>

<p>I pointed out that the other personality was not strictly a Marxist,
though he had learnt very much from Marx. Victor ignored my
interruption.</p>

<p>He continued, "Then all this religious stuff. Of course it is
fundamentally sound and very important, but my brilliant brother (as I
call him) is too clever by half about it, The things he writes are too
subtle to get across to ordinary people. I sometimes wonder whether
they are really so profund as he seems to think. I suspect they
sometimes merely express brilliantly a fundamentally confused state of
mind. But I am using his work a lot. Oh, yes, I shall be able to make
something good out of it."</p>

<p>The Dolt's complacency took my breath away. Not until subsequent
conversations did I discover that all this was a fa&ccedil;ade. He was
building up a character that he wanted me to believe in. But he did not
really believe in it himself. Under this patronizing assurance toward
the true Victor I gradually began to sense a very different attitude.
Not till quite late in my visit did the truth begin to appear.</p>

<p>I had, of course, watched with great interest the relations between
Victor and Maggie. Generally he treated her with a rather crude kind of
gallantry in which I detected an undercurrent of malice. On one
occasion Maggie appeared in a new coat and skirt of plain design,
Victor eyed it silently for a moment, then remarked, "Charming,
charming, my dear; to those who can appreciate your peculiar style of
beauty." He paused, then continued, "But those who can't, might feel
that only an obviously attractive woman could carry off such a severe
fashion," Thus he gave a veiled expression to his own dislike of
Maggie's appearance, and yet at the same time claimed that he was
sensitive enough to appreciate her.</p>

<p>On another occasion he expressed his hostility more openly. Sheila
had been sick in the night, and Maggie appeared at breakfast in her
dressing-gown. A rather large area of creamy bosom was visible. Victor
said, "For God's sake don't expose yourself like that. Even if your
body is more attractive than your face you are not entitled to display
it." Maggie clutched her dressing-gown tightly round her, turned
Crimson, and replied with spirit, "Don't make yourself ridiculous!" I
protested that there was nothing at all unseemly in her dress, and made
it quite clear that Victor s remark had shocked me.</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence. Then in a different voice he said,
"Maggie, please forgive me. I suppose I'm hypersensitive, or neurotic
or something."</p>

<p>That evening, after Maggie had gone upstairs, Victor asked me to
stay and talk to him. He offered me a drink; but, knowing his weakness,
I refused. He brought out the bottle of whisky and tried to persuade
me, but I remained firm. For a moment he hesitated, then put the bottle
back, and sat down opposite me by the fire. Filling his pipe, he said
in a dull voice, "I have talked a lot of rot since you came." I
awkwardly protested, but he continued, "All that gassing about my being
the synthesis of the two Victors is just rubbish. I wish it were true,
but it isn't." He lit his pipe and gazed moodily into the fire. He
said, "Of course I know quite well, really, that the other is the
better man. But it's distressing, and so I pretend to patronize him. I
don't really feel at all superior to my brilliant better half. I
pretend to, but the pretence is becoming more and more transparent,
even to me; specially under Maggie's eagle eye. I know quite well that
everything worth while in me comes from him, mostly through Maggie.
Really, I want to be him, even though at times I loathe him. I know I
can't be him; but at least I want to do what I can to stand for the
things he stands for. I want to learn from him all I can. I want to do
his chosen work, not just because he chose it but because I myself have
learnt to see how important it is today. But, hell, I'm not bright
enough. Mind you, I'm bright enough by ordinary standards, quite as
bright as you, you old stick-in-the-mud. But--well, there are things he
wrote in his notes and his book that I can't really grasp. And, what's
worse, even now that I accept his values, I can't stick to them and
stand up for them as he did; because--well, I suppose I'm not possessed
by them as he is."</p>

<p>Victor brooded in silence. His pipe had gone out. I had to say
something, but all that came was, "I wish I could help somehow."</p>

<p>Then I added, "But Maggie is helping you a lot, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "she's wonderful. "Then in a burst of frankness he
unburdened himself about her. "The trouble is, she can't realize she's
not my style. I never married her. I'm not her husband. I really do see
her merits. I profoundly respect her. I even love her, in a way; as
long as she keeps her distance. But the sight of her and the touch of
her simply don't appeal to me. In fact they repel me. I'm repelled all
the more because I do feel there's a repulsive fascination about her.
She's--well, a female ape with a woman's intelligence, and a superhuman
generosity.</p>

<p>"'His Monkey Wife'!" Victor laughed harshly.</p>

<p>I felt a surge of indignation, and I protested hotly that he was
being grossly unfair to her on the score of looks. She was certainly
not a beauty, but it was untrue and false to say that she was
repulsively fascinating. "Indeed," I said, "your other self has taught
me to see something of her strange beauty, now and then." He replied,
"Oh, well, that is how I feel about her myself. And so, when I do find
myself attracted by her I can't help feeling it's a disgusting
perversion that must be resisted at all costs." I scornfully rejected
this idea, and urged him to let himself go the next time he felt her
attraction, and perhaps that would cure him of his silly notions.
"Christ!" he said. "If I did let myself go I should savage her. No! I
must keep a hold on myself."</p>

<p>One morning I came downstairs to find both Maggie and Victor at
breakfast. This was unusual, for generally Victor appeared late, often
staying in bed for the meal. What was more unusual was that both were
laughing happily. The children also were in high spirits. Once glance
at Victor told me that he was himself again. The alert eyes, the
uncurbed lips, were unmistakable. "Yes," said Victor, "I am myself
again, at last. I'm afraid the Dolt has given you rather an
uncomfortable visit, so far, Harry." I asked him when the change had
happened. He answered merely, "Last night, about two o'clock." After
breakfast, when the children had gone off to play, I was told more
about it. Maggie said, "In the middle of the night I was awakened by a
knock at my door. It was Victor, the real Victor. I recognized his
voice at once. He said, 'Let me in, Maggie darling.'" (I noted that she
had locked her door, but I made no comment.) Victor took up the thread,
"So she let me in, and we did our best to add to the family." Maggie
protested, her eyes sparkling, her colour rising.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the whole house was changed. The children seemed
delighted to find their father in a friendly mood, and each was
determined to have as much as possible of him while he lasted. It was
as though Victor were a soldier home on a short leave. The same
poignant happiness, the same sense of brevity and precariousness, the
same alternation of easy talk and awkward silence; and between the
married pair the same tendency to keep hold of each other. I began to
wonder whether they would rather that I left the place to them. But
when I suggested this, they both vehemently protested.</p>

<p>It happened that Victor was due to take a class that same evening.
He asked Maggie to arrange for someone to mind the children, so that
she and I could both accompany him. "Let's go by train instead of the
car," he said, "it's friendlier."</p>

<p>We arrived rather early in the schoolroom where the class was to be
held. As the members arrived, Victor talked to individuals here and
there about their work. When some twenty-five adults were uncomfortably
seated at desks meant for children, Victor began his talk. He started
by saying that he did-not intend to cover any new ground on this
occasion, because he wanted to clear up a number of points that he had
not dealt with satisfactorily earlier in the session. "I have not been
in very good form recently," he said, "but I'm wide-awake now, and I
had better make the best of it." The class had already tumbled to it
that he was brighter than usual, and there was an unmistakable air of
expectancy in the room. I noticed that the various corrections and
qualifications that Victor made to his own earlier statements were all
such as to give a more balanced view, and a view less easily acceptable
to the class. Evidently the Dolt had been accustomed to take the line
of least resistance by allowing a good many extravagant Leftist
pronouncements to go unanswered, and even by pandering to such opinions
in his lectures. The awake Victor, though in some ways far more to the
Left in politics than the Dolt, would not tolerate unfair or uncritical
propaganda. On this occasion he had a passage of arms with an ardent
Communist who was outraged that Victor should now be anxious to insist
that there had been much real good-heartedness and self-sacrificing
social work among employers. The young man rose and made a formal
protest, deploring "this change of heart in our respected tutor ", and
plainly hinting that Victor had to talk like that for fear of losing
his job. Victor laughed, and then let himself go on the subject of
over-simplifying history and human nature for the sake of a theory
which was largely true but not the whole truth. He turned the incident
to good account by a short statement on the terrific complexity of the
universe, and the fact that none of the great questions could be
properly answered, because they were all at bottom false questions.
Always what we had to do was to ask new and subtler questions. When
someone remarked, "Yes, but we must have some certainty to live by,"
Victor said, "You can't have it, and it's no use pretending." Then he
corrected himself and said, "You can find in your own heart the only
certainty that matters, namely that the way of community, of love and
friendliness, is good, and that we must strive to live that way if we
are to fulfil our nature. But certainty about the universe--No!
Impossible! Let's just be humble about it, and reverently
agnostic."</p>

<p>I think it was on the third evening after this that Victor told me
about his ill-treatment of Maggie when he was in his less-awake phase.
We were all three sitting round the fire, Maggie sewing, Victor mending
crockery, I as usual idly smoking. (Mending crockery, by the way, was
an operation which the Dolt had always refused to undertake.
Consequently a collection of broken cups and plates had always
accumulated for the true Victor to cope with on his rare visits. The
little "daily help" who worked for Maggie at this time was more amiable
than careful.) I had noticed, as the days advanced since Victor's
waking, an increasing sadness in his relations with Maggie. This was to
be expected, since his lucid state was not likely to last much longer.
I could also detect a growing anxiety on Maggie's account. On one
occasion I had overheard Maggie say to him, "It's all right, Victor
dear. I can deal with him." And Victor replied, "God! I think you ought
to learn jujitsu or carry a pistol." She laughed.</p>

<p>On this evening of the crockery-mending the truth came out.
Carefully fitting two bits of a saucer together, Victor said, "Maggie
may not have told you how rottenly the Dolt sometimes treats her. She's
too kind."</p>

<p>Maggie looked uncomfortable and said, "Oh, surely the details don't
matter. I did tell him there had been trouble."</p>

<p>Victor insisted, "The details do matter. I am very anxious about it
all. Do you know, Harry, the Dolt, once went at her with a knife. I,
Victor, once went at Maggie with a knife. Fortunately she was able to
lock herself into the lavatory, and stay there till I cooled down."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, laughing, "and of course while Victor, poor
dear, was crazily stabbing at the door the laundry van came. We missed
sending our clothes that week. Afterwards, of course my unfortunate
husband was bitterly ashamed of himself, and I think he would have
stuck the knife in his own gizzard if I had not taken it from him."</p>

<p>I asked what the cause of the trouble was. Maggie said, "I thought
Victor was out of the house, because I had not heard the car come back;
and I was walking about in my petticoat because it was so hot. But
Victor had left the car at the garage for repairs and walked home. So
he caught me unawares. The sight of me like that sent him crazy.
Heavens it was a picnic! And so funny, somehow I But it all happened
ages ago. He has been a lamb for ever so long now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Victor, "but things might quite well go wrong again any
time. And there was that other affair."</p>

<p>Maggie brightly said, "Oh, that was earlier still. And now, as you
know, I lock my door at night." Victor said," I had not been able to
sleep. At the class where I had been that I evening there was a rather
seductive girl. When I was going over some written work with her after
the class squashed against her in one of those ridiculous little desks,
I got all sexy. After that, I had a sleepless night. My mind was going
round and round about sex and Maggie. What I regarded as the bestial
fascination of her began to get the better of my repugnance. At last I
just went to her room."</p>

<p>Maggie intervened. "I heard the door open, and for a moment I lay
still with my heart thumping. Then I said 'Is that you, Victor?' There
was no answer. He simply rushed straight at me. I very soon knew it was
not my own darling Victor after all, but just the poor other Victor. He
was rough and savage, and cruel too. I said I wouldn't be made love to
like that, and I fought. I bit his shoulder hard, but he took no
notice. Then it suddenly came over me that after all he really was my
own Victor at heart, and I gave up."</p>

<p>Victor continued, "Presently it came over me that I was being a
disgusting brute, and I ran away."</p>

<p>"After that," said Maggie. "I locked my door every night."</p>

<p>Victor turned to me and said, "Now do you wonder why I am anxious?"
But Maggie insisted that it was all ancient history, and the other
Victor would never do that sort of thing now. "And some day," she said,
"he is going to love me, properly." When I suggested that some day the
true Victor would be permanently established, they both sadly rejected
this possibility. Maggie said, "The best we can hope for is that his
visits will not become rarer and shorter and finally cease altogether."
"But it's a slender hope," Victor said. "We have plotted the curve of
the phases for the last eight years; and extrapolation suggests that I
shall have vanished entirely by 1948 or 1950. And if it had not been
for Maggie's help. I should probably have vanished long ago."</p>

<p>I had no clear idea as to how Maggie helped Victor to remain awake,
so I asked her to tell me. Victor interposed. "Mainly just by being
Maggie, and loving me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, "mainly by loving him. But also by what one
might call telepathic support, or (more accurately) by inducing the
common spiritual soil, in which we are all rooted, to nourish the
spirit in him."</p>

<p>This sort of talk made me turn all sceptical and cynical, but I
report it as faithfully as I can. Victor said, "She likes to put it
that way; but the truth is inexpressible. One might just as well call
it prayer, and leave the whole matter unexplained."</p>

<p>The plight of these two was indeed strange and distressing. Victor
had reconciled himself to the expectation that his times of lucidity
would cease altogether, and that he would never be able to pursue
effectively his chosen work. He was naturally very anxious that the
Dolt should not give the world a garbled version of that work. He
vaguely hoped that he and Maggie would be able to induce in the other a
greater humility and a greater sincerity. But little progress had so
far been made. In spite of this gloomy prospect, however, Victor seemed
to be fundamentally reconciled to his fate. He said, "Evidently it is
not in the pattern of history that I should be the one to clarify man's
consciousness about his relation to the heart of things; but someone,
some day will do it. Or some other race somewhere in the universe will
see what I am trying to see. Indeed, maybe they have done so, long ago.
And ultimately, Harry, what supremely matters is not that this or that
individual or species should find peace (or' salvation ') through the
intruding vision of the spirit, but that the spirit should somewhere or
somewhen be perceived with full clarity and worshipped with full
intelligence." This remark of Victor's greatly perplexed me, but I
record it for what it is worth.</p>

<p>With regard to Maggie his position was very distressing. They would
meet less and less often; and each time he would inherit memories of
the Dolt's insensitive treatment of her. Occasionally, even the true
serene Victor, when he was not quite at his best, would suffer bitterly
on this score. In relation to Maggie's misfortune he could never quite
maintain, the sublime acceptance which was natural to him in relation
to his own misfortune. She herself, however, put a brave face on it.
Though she obviously longed to have the true Victor always, she
maintained a gallant confidence that in time she would win the poor
substitute Victor wholly to the true Victor's values, and to real love
for herself. "And then," she said, "he will really be my true Victor,
though without my darling's brilliance." And she claimed that she
herself was beginning to love the lesser Victor for his own sake and
not merely because she knew that at heart he was the true Victor. This
remark intrigued me, and I asked her to explain. After a silence she
said, "I suppose I am beginning to love him maternally, with tenderness
toward his weakness, and charity toward his perversity, and pride in
his struggle to rise above himself. You see, he really is trying. He is
having a desperate moral struggle. The Victor that is with us now has
no struggle, not against sheer selfishness, I mean. He has said so,
time and again. So he has no need of me to mother him." Victor
interrupted, half in jest, half in earnest. "God!" he said, "I'm
beginning to feel jealous of the Dolt. He is going to have so much of
you, and I so little. Of course, in a way I have you all the time,
because it's me you love in him, and because when I wake I have all his
experience. But it's dismal to remember how he falls short of loving
you properly. And Maggie, I do need you; not to mother me, merely, but
to keep me from dying utterly into him." Maggie suddenly rose from her
chair, and put her arms round Victor's neck.</p>

<p>To complete the picture of Victor as I found him in 1939, I will say
something of his relations with his children. Maggie had told me that
in the early days of the Dolt's return, Victor had not tried to conceal
his resentment against Colin. On several occasions he had treated the
child rather brutally, once thrashing him severely for some paltry
offence. But gradually he had made clumsy advances, and in the end a
tolerable relationship had been established. Maggie had told Colin
vaguely about his father's illness. She had done her best to persuade
the boy that, when his father was in his ordinary state, he was not
really "himself" at all. He was living in a kind of long bad dream. She
told Colin much about the gentleness and humour of Victor in the days
before he "fell ill", and insisted that even the ordinary Victor was
like that at heart, and was gradually recovering his former genial
nature. To me it seemed almost a miracle that she succeeded at all in
winning her son over to this view. But, then, she was something of a
witch. And in spite of his detached man-to-man behaviour, he loved and
respected her very deeply. It was clear to me that the boy had come to
model his behaviour toward Victor on his mother's forbearance and
patience toward her husband in his less attractive phases. This
admirable conduct would probably have been quite impossible to Colin
but for the fact that he had first-hand acquaintance with the true
Victor as a very satisfactory sort of parent. With the less awake
Victor, the happiest incident had I been when Colin had been severely
ill, and Victor was so far roused out of his habitual indifference that
he had eagerly and devotedly taken his share of the nursing, and had
done his best to entertain his son during the long convalescence. This
affair had established better relations both between Victor and Colin
and between Victor and Maggie.</p>

<p>One morning early in my visit, while the lesser personality was
still on the scene, Victor found himself in the mood for playing with
Colin. I had noticed that, hitherto, father and son had, on the whole,
left each other alone, so Victor's announcement that he proposed to
play with Colin surprised me. He explained, "I want to keep in touch
with the lad. And it will be refreshing after last night's class. Come,
Harry! You must join in." It was a wet morning. Colin was absorbed in
drawing, for which he showed a considerable talent. Victor said to him,
"I have a bit of time to spare, so would you like to get the railway
out?" Colin cheerfully said, "Righto," but continued drawing. After a
couple of minutes, during which Victor was showing me one of the
locomotives, he turned to Colin, and said, "Well, what about it?" After
one more careful stroke of the pencil, Colin went to the cupboard and
fetched out a large box of railway lines. The three of us worked for a
while, laying a complicated track from the playroom along the landing
and into the far end of the guest-room. There were stations, a tunnel
under my bed, sidings, and so on. The set was a magnificent electric
system, built up birthday by birthday. When the track was laid, Colin
was stationed in the playroom, I in the guest- room, and Victor took
charge of the siding on the landing. There followed a very absorbing
game with three trains and a great deal of work at the points. I noted
that though Colin entered into the spirit of the game quite well, he
was apt to snatch every opportunity for returning to his drawing. Once,
when he failed to dispatch a train at the right moment, Victor was
quite cross. It was also Victor, not Colin, who was cross when Sheila,
wanting her dolly to have a ride on the train, tripped over a station
and disintegrated the line. Altogether, I got the impression that it
was Colin who was entertaining Victor, not the reverse. And very
gracefully he had done it, apart from one malicious moment, when (I
suspect) he deliberately staged a head-on collision.</p>

<p>The behaviour of father and son over the model railway had given me
a clearer view of the character of the less awake Victor at this time.
Whenever the true Victor appeared (so Maggie said) the general change
of atmosphere affected Colin very noticeably. Even the small Sheila
seemed to be aware of a propitious change. I myself had witnessed this
change in the children on the morning when the true Victor reappeared.
After the happy breakfast had come to an end, and the table had been
cleared, Colin came along to his father with his cherished drawing-
book, and said, "Daddy, I've done heaps of drawings since I last showed
you. Look!" He dragged Victor to a chair and put the open book on his
knees. Victor turned over the pages, and said, "Marvellous! You have
done a lot! But look, there are so many! I think we had better wait
till this afternoon. I want to talk to Uncle Harry now." Colin
protested, "No, Daddy, please look now! You may be different this
afternoon. Please!" Victor's heart was touched, and he said, "Right!
We'll get Uncle Harry to help." Colin dragged a chair beside his
father's, and told me to stand behind and look over their shoulders.
Victor studied each drawing carefully and then made a few comments,
jocular or serious. Sometimes he reacted with critical approval,
sometimes with ribaldry, but always he did his best to be helpful.
There were drawings of animals (with something of the vigour of
paleolithic paintings), of cars, ships, aeroplanes; and dramatic
sketches of people having lurid adventures. Victor would say, "That's
no picture at all. Every line in it is quarrelling with every other.
There's no oneness to it," Or else, "That's not a bad effort, Colin,
but this fellow has a side-face with a front-face eye in it. If you
really intended that, to get both front and side-face into the picture,
for the picture's sake, well and good; but I can't help feeling you
just got muddled." Of another of Colin's creations he said, "Gosh! That
poor blighter's legs never grew big enough for his body. And what's
this man with the string bag emptied on his head?" Colin indignantly
explained that it was a woman with fuzzy hair. When Victor came to a
drawing of a steamer in a rough sea, he pointed out that the smoke was
going one way and the flags another. Sometimes Victor would make little
drawings in the margin, and Colin would watch intently.</p>

<p>A loose piece of paper slipped out of the book. Colin grabbed at it,
with obvious embarrassment, but Victor was already holding it and
scrutinizing it. Anxiously, Colin said, "I forgot that was there,
Daddy," and tried to retrieve it. But Victor, laughing with relish,
held it out of reach. It was a drawing of a face. And crude as it was,
it was obviously Victor himself, wearing his most Doltish expression.
Victor handed up the drawing to me, and started a playful brawl with
Colin.</p>

<p>Nothing else need be reported about my visit to the Smiths in 1939.
The true Victor was still in occupation when I left, but it was clear
that both he and Maggie expected each day to be their last. Latterly
the poignancy of the situation had been difficult for me to bear. They
both behaved with normal calm, but there was a vague tension in all
that they did. I was glad when the time came for me to leave them to
themselves.</p>

<h2>11 - GLOOM</h2>

<h4>From 1939 to 1946</h4>

<p>THE SECOND WORLD WAR prevented me from seeing the Smiths again till
1946, for I was forced to remain in India till the war was over and I
could secure a passage home. During the war years I occasionally had a
letter from Victor or Maggie, but they were neither of them prolific
correspondents, and I learned only the salient events of their lives.
Another baby, appeared, Margaret. Victor added a little to his slender
income by occasional writing. I gathered that the awake Victor's
'appearances became rarer and rarer, but that the secondary personality
was becoming a reformed character.</p>

<p>At the outset of the war, the secondary Victor, believing himself to
be acting according to the best lights of his more gifted "brother",
declared himself a pacifist. This decision had been taken after much
heart-searching, and under the influence of notes and articles written
by the awake Victor during the early years of the inter-war period.
Maggie too was still much influenced by the attitude that Victor had
adopted in those days; but the awake Victor himself, on his brief re-
appearances, had gradually come to take up a different view. On each
occasion he spent much time re-assessing the memories of the other
about the reports of Nazi ruthlessness in Germany and elsewhere, and
the disastrous appeasement practised by the democratic powers; and
little by little he was forced to the conclusion that this war had
indeed to be fought. I have already referred to the fact that over this
matter he had a genuinely moral struggle. It was difficult for him to
abandon the pacifist's habit of mind, and to face the fact that, potent
as "non-violence" is, it cannot solve all problems. Pacifism, he now
affirmed, would be a betrayal of urgent concrete duty for the sake of
an abstraction. He gradually persuaded Maggie to this view; and through
her he tried to influence his own other self. But the bewildered other
at first resisted strongly, regarding his brilliant "brother" as a
renegade. In declaring himself a pacifist the Dolt had satisfied his
increasing loyalty to the values of his other self; yet in stubbornly
clinging to his pacifism in spite of the true Victor's change of
opinion, he seems to have enjoyed asserting his own independence.
However, what with the arguments brought to bear on him by the
converted Maggie and a written communication left for him by the awake
Victor, and (above all) the pressure of circumstances, he was at last
painfully driven to recant.</p>

<p>He then swung over to a sense of his military obligation. His career
in the previous war had been erratic but brilliant. He therefore
decided to apply for some sort of army job in the new war. Maggie told
me that after he had renounced his pacifism, and was awaiting the
result of his letter to the War Office, he went through a phase of
scarcely veiled self-importance, as though the whole defence of the
Empire rested on his shoulders. Occasionally, however, a schoolboy
gaiety would break through his solemnity. It was obvious that he was
extremely glad to be relieved of the burden of pacifism. His heart's
desire now was to find himself once more in khaki. But alas! His
application was rejected on psychological grounds. After a spell of
profound mortification and self-loathing, he brought himself to stoop
so far as to join the Local Defence Volunteers, later called the Home
Guard. Gradually he restored his self-respect by devoted and no doubt
thoroughly efficient work in this connection. So enthusiastic and
energetic was he, that he soon rose to a very responsible position. For
him, the Home Guard now appeared as the true backbone of Britain's
defence. All this while, he managed also to carry on his normal adult
educational duties. Owing to the pressure of war conditions these
civilian evening classes were gradually much reduced; but a new kind of
adult education began to be organized, namely in the Forces. Victor
threw himself into this with enthusiasm, and throughout the greater
part of the war years it was his main occupation. He said little about
it in his rare letters to me, for reasons of military security. But
after the war, when I met him again, he described it in some detail,
and in due course I shall record the main facts, in so far as they bear
upon the theme of this book.</p>

<p>Such was my scanty knowledge of Victor's affairs during the years
between 1939 and 1946. Shortly after the end of the war I managed to
secure a passage home; and once more I visited the Smiths. Owing to the
housing shortage they were still in the same little surburban villa,
though it was now much too small for them. Eleven years and the strain
of wartime life had affected them both rather severely. Maggie received
me at the door; and, as so often happens when one meets an old friend
after a long absence, her welcoming smile flooded me with a sudden
sense of her personality. I was so taken aback that I stammered out
some bit of admiration. She laughed and coloured, gave me an unexpected
kiss, and said, "I'm an old woman, but I have never come in for many
compliments, and I still like them." She had indeed aged. Her brilliant
mane was reduced both in bulk and in splendour. I thought of ploughed
red earth sprinkled with lime. Her face had weathered to a healthy
russet. It was the eyes and mouth that gave me that sudden vision of
beauty. Suffering, hope deferred and much service of others had
tempered her face to an expression of great delicacy. It was as though
an inner spiritual beauty had conquered the uncouthness of her features
and forced them to be lovely.</p>

<p>As I entered, Victor came in from the garden, apologizing for his
dirty hands. Again the greeting told me much. There was a real
friendliness, which contrasted with that remembered formal and
patronizing greeting of seven years earlier. But Victor was obviously
aging rapidly. He looked older than his fifty-six years. The grey hair
had retreated from his brow. His face was gaunt and pale and heavily
lined. The flabbiness that had shocked me in 1939 had given place to an
extreme leanness. The eyes were still half-veiled by the Dolt's
drooping lids, but there was a curious change. The lower lids seemed to
have risen to meet the upper. This gave an impression as of a person
habitually straining to overcome short-sightedness, or constantly
suffering from a headache, or perhaps struggling to understand some
awkward problem.</p>

<p>When I came down from my room I met Sheila, now a girl of ten. In
her, the father's regular features tempered the mother's oddities, and
I guessed that Sheila might well develop an intriguing beauty. She
seemed to be a happy child. I learned later that though her main
interest at present seemed to be tennis and the "flicks", her school
record suggested that she might in due season capture a university
scholarship, if she could put her back into her work. Colin I did not
seee. He was away at boarding school. His parents spoke of him with a
faintly anxious but respectful affection. They had expected him to take
up some form of plastic art; but toward the end of the war he had
conceived a passion for flying. Victor remarked, "Oh, Colin is capable;
but a dark horse." Maggie added, "A dear dark horse." The third child,
Margaret, now about five, had a rather charming little monkey face, and
a great capacity for mischief. She was nearly always able to get her
own way with her doting father.</p>

<p>In my many talks with Victor and Maggie, sometimes separately and
sometimes together, I formed a fairly clear picture of their life
during the years since I had last seen them. It was now some eighteen
months since the true Victor had last appeared; and he had vanished
again on the very next day. But the established Victor was a very
different person from the disorientated and distracted creature whom I
had met seven years earlier. There were no more of those phases of
revolt against all that the true Victor had championed. The former
"Dolt" now consciously and rather pathetically modelled himself on his
"vanishing brother". Also, he had now quite overcome his physical
repugnance to Maggie. This had happened very shortly after my previous
visit. I heard of the change from Victor himself; and also from Maggie,
separately. Though factually their accounts were identical, their
commentaries were strikingly different. Victor regarded the whole
incident with a mixture of shame at his antics and thankfulness at
their outcome. Maggie adopted an attitude suggestive, I thought, of the
parents' rejoicing over the return of the prodigal son.</p>

<p>Shortly after I had left England in 1939, Victor had formed a
sentimental attachment to a certain Amabel, a young woman of naively
intellectual tastes. She sought distraction from the uninspiring job of
looking after an invalid mother whose tastes were far from
intellectual. Socially she was a cut above the average of his students.
She always dressed with a quiet distinction. She had the correct figure
and the kind of good looks that are popularized by commercial artists.
She regarded Victor as a brilliant intellectual who had married beneath
him and had need of refined companionship. Obviously it was her mission
to supply the need. Without any clear thought of the future, the two
began meeting one another outside the classroom; and in due season
Victor persuaded her to spend a night with him in a hotel. This became
a habit. He explained to Maggie that after the class he was too tired
to come home on the same evening. Maggie soon suspected that there was
more to it than that, and little by little she found out the main
facts. She never challenged him, but he gradually realized that she
knew all about it. Maggie was surprised to find how fiercely jealous
she could be at heart while maintaining a fa&ccedil;ade of detachment.
"And yet," she said, "I could not really blame my poor Victor. He was
not really being unfaithful to me, because he had never been my lover."
Though she managed to maintain an appearance of calm indifference,
Victor's affair had a deep effect on her. Resentment against him for
all the disappointment and suffering that he had caused her froze all
her tenderness towards him. She behaved in a way that was superficially
correct according to her established standards, but her inner hostility
showed through at every turn.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on Victor's side his love affair proved a source of far
more torment than delight. For even to the somnolent Victor it soon
became obvious that Amabel was a poor creature compared with Maggie;
and that Maggie was necessary to him. When her new coldness toward him
had developed into a fixed habit, he became uncontrollably miserable
and lonely. He told me, "It was as though the air I had breathed for so
long without paying any attention to it had turned to acid fumes."</p>

<p>In passing, it is worth while noting the awake Victor's reaction to
the Amabel affair. On the rare and brief occasions when he appeared, he
was torn between exasperation and detachment. Remembering that the Dolt
was after all at bottom identical with himself, and that it was indeed
he, Victor, that had made love to Amabel, he could not but feel
self-ridicule and annoyance. He could escape this mood only by
exercising his most "awake" powers of standing right outside himself,
and regarding himself with objectivity as a particular human individual
among countless others.</p>

<p>Though the awake Victor could well appreciate Amabel's physical
lusciousness, he saw this animal ripeness itself blighted by a mildew
of cultural affectation. It was as though a simple and comely farm
house had been painted over to look like marble. He writhed at the
memory of the sentimentality and self-deception that each of the pair
had evoked in the other, pretending that what was in fact just an
honest-to-God animal lust sprang from a deep spiritual affinity. For
the awake Victor, Amabel's mincing voice and meticulous choice of
words, her pathetic attempt to be a blue-stocking, somehow eclipsed her
physical charms.</p>

<p>As for the Dolt, his feeling for Amabel gradually changed from
attraction to contempt, and he began shamefacedly courting his wife.
His repugnance was slowly displaced by a late discovery that the
powerful spell which she had always exercised over him was not, after
all, bestial or diabolic, but (to use his own adjective) "angelic".</p>

<p>At an earlier stage Maggie would have greeted Victor's advances with
frank enthusiasm, but now, to her own distress, she was completely
cold. But in the end her feelings were changed in a rather crucial
incident. The true Victor had been in command for a few days and though
he shared the common body with the faithless other Victor, Maggie felt
no repugnance against that body when the true Victor possessed it. As
usual they slept together. Apparently the lesser Victor awoke one night
to find himself in bed with Maggie, and being ardently embraced by her.
He realized at once that her caresses were meant for his brilliant
"brother", who had gone to bed with her. The lesser Victor had the
presence of mind to continue his "brother's" love-making without
letting Maggie suspect the change. Not until the crisis was passed, and
they were lying peacefully in each other's arms, did he tell her what
had happened.</p>

<p>This incident was the beginning of a new relationship between them.
Little by little Maggie s bitterness passed, and the two at last lived
as man and wife. They shared a bedroom, thereby allowing more space for
the children. At the time of my second visit from India, in 1946, there
was obviously a great tenderness between them. It is difficult to say
how I knew this, for they were not at all demonstrative toward each
other. Both were now well advanced in years. The ardours of youth had
long since passed. But I noticed that each addressed the other with a
voice subtly different from that which they used to other people.</p>

<p>I must not give a false impression. In a long talk with Maggie one
evening, when Victor was away lecturing, I learned more about her
feelings toward her substitute husband after the Amabel affair. That
distressing incident had happened some six years earlier. Shortly after
its conclusion, when she was already near the age when childbirth would
no longer be safe, Margaret was born. And now Margaret was a junior
schoolgirl.</p>

<p>Though Maggie was at last fully mated to the Victor who had for so
long rejected her, and though indeed she loved him dearly, yet it was
only the other Victor ("my own true Victor") who kindled her fully. Him
she adored. Toward the other, she felt a love that was three parts
pity. With the true Victor she attained that passionate friendship
between equals which is the fullest expression of love; though (she
insisted) it was only through his powerful influence on her that she
was able to rise to be in a manner his equal. To her he seemed always
godlike, though through his power she had become his equal lover. He
had raised her, formed her spirit. For him and with him she had become
more than herself. In fact he was Eros to her Psyche. But to the other
Victor she felt a tenderness which, in so far as it was more than an
echo of that deeper love, was motherly. She had given him her body, not
with the exultation of surrender to a god, but almost as she had given
her breast to her baby, with a kind of ardent compassion.</p>

<p>From Victor himself I gathered much the same impression. He said, "I
know quite well that I can never be to her what my brother is. But it
was not only for his sake that she came to love me. Strangely, I could
give her something which he could not give, or not in the same degree,
namely a man to mother."</p>

<p>On one of my days with the Smiths, Maggie suggested that Victor and
I should avail ourselves of the lovely winter weather, and the fact
that he had no engagements, by going for a longish walk on the moors
outside the town. She wanted to get us both out of the way while she
did some early "spring-cleaning".</p>

<p>Victor took me in his ancient sports car, which he had kept in
action throughout the war for travelling to the military units where he
had to lecture. Now that the basic ration of petrol was restored, it
was possible to use the car occasionally for private purposes. He was
no longer the keen driver that he had been, but he still found motoring
agreeable. We left the car at a point where the road passed over the
shoulder of a hill. Thence we set off up a lane that had been badly
chewed up by tanks and guns. After a couple of miles we reached a
deserted military post of some sort, where empty huts were surrounded
by a disgusting litter of old cans and other refuse. Thence we struck
out by a footpath toward the moor. There was snow on the upper levels,
and the bright morning was giving place to a sombre east-wind noon.</p>

<p>Life in India does not keep one in training for rough walking, and
it was soon apparent that Victor was a good deal the more active of us.
This was convenient, for it enabled him to talk while I was labouring
up the hillside. Occasionally I paused for breath, and to look about
me. The valley from which we had emerged was one of the many deep
grooves in the great plateau of moorland. It was a largely
industrialized region, and the smoke from its chimneys contributed to
the black haze of the east wind. In one direction the valley lost
itself among the sweeping moors; and in the other the view was blocked
by the smoke pall of the town. After a while I suggested stopping for
lunch, and when we had found a tolerably sheltered spot we settled down
behind a wall and took out our sandwiches.</p>

<p>Over lunch the conversation turned to the relations between Victor's
two personalities. "My 'brother'," he said, "is an optimist of the
deepest dye. He still believes that mankind will turn the corner into
some kind of glorious Utopia, though he admits we may destroy ourselves
with atomic power. How I wish I could feel as he does I But I can't. He
has faith in mankind because he has such superb faith in himself.
Perhaps it is because I have lost faith in myself that I am losing
faith in mankind. Much as I admire him, I can't help regarding him as
in a way my younger brother. He retains the buoyancy of youth. After
all, he is young compared with me. His actual conscious life has been
far shorter than mine. Add up all his periods and then mine, and he
can't be half my age. Of course he has all my memories, but he never
has time to digest them all properly and turn them to his own account.
So he is really quite inexperienced." Victor seemed to sense my
unexpressed disagreement, for he added, "Of course, I know he is
brilliant, and his mind works far more rapidly than mine; but he can't
really keep up, and so he is always in danger of missing the tragic
impact of the years. Of course he shares my old body, with all its
little accumulating breakdowns and weaknesses; but it doesn't seem to
make him old mentally." Victor paused, and I remarked that, compared
with me, he seemed very fit and active. "Oh, I'm in fairly good
condition," he said, "for my years. But--well you know as well as I do
how senescence hampers one. The odd thing is that it doesn't seem to
hamper him, except by making him appear less often."</p>

<p>There was silence again. We munched our cake, and thought our own
thoughts. Then he said, "I am convinced that my imposing other self
doesn't really know what wretched stuff average human nature is. If our
average had been just a little more intelligent and a little more
sensitive, we might have made quite a different sort of world. But
think of that filthy camp we passed, and the messed-up valley, and our
whole industrial civilization, and the war, and the Nazis. It's very
simple really. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. And
that's what we are, nearly all of us, just sows' ears. I know very well
that's all I am myself, and really I'm quite good average stuff, indeed
rather brighter than average in some ways. But my other self is a real
ready-made silk purse. Hence his one big glorious mistake of supposing
that everyone has a nice piece of real silk somehow hidden away inside
his sow's' ear." We both laughed. I insisted that he himself really had
a lot of silk in his make-up, otherwise he would have remained merely
the Dolt. He shook his head. "That was just my brother's influence," he
said, "and perhaps Maggie's magic." I rather warmly declared that we
were all really pretty good at heart, but spoiled by circumstances. He
pulled a wry face, and said, "I have seen a good deal of the plain man
(and woman) in the Forces, and I know his limitations, and hers; just
as I know my own. He's unimaginative, self-centred, conventional,
vindictive, and he won't think if he can possibly help it. Damn it! I
have good reason to know the plain man, because I am the plain man
though uncomfortably raised a little by outside influences. And because
I have had an ideal imposed on me, by outside influences, and I haven't
the strength (or the effective will) to live up to it, deep in my heart
I hate the things I love. And so I keep queering my own pitch with
sudden acts of resentfulness and cruelty, hurting or insulting the very
things I love; hurting Maggie, just because she's too good for me, and
because she was forced on me by my other self; spoiling my work in the
classes by sudden indifference and irresponsibility or positive
malicious provocation of the tiresome people I am supposed to teach.
And in all this I am not exceptional at all. I am just what the plain
man is. O God, how I hate myself sometimes; and him, and everything. I
hate the bad things for being bad and the good things for being
good."</p>

<p>This distressing talk left me dumb. Though I felt painful pity for
my unhappy friend. I was also hostile, and inclined to blame him for
lacking grit.</p>

<p>We had finished our lunch, so we rose to our feet and continued our
way over the gentle slopes of the great moorland plateau. To break the
black silence that had descended on us, I asked Victor to tell me more
about his work in army education. He said, "I suppose we did rather
more good than harm, and sometimes it was quite stimulating both to
lecturer and audiences. Yes, one did sometimes feel that the discussion
kindled people. But my 'brother', who only took my place very seldom,
thought it was all marvellous. He used to write copious notes
afterwards, to help me. And they really were very useful. He was always
surprised to find these very average 'cross-section' audiences so
thoughtful. He insisted that people were all waking up at last; and
that, if they were not led up the garden path by devilish propaganda,
they would found a new world after the war. Well, there's some truth in
that view, but look at the world now! Everyone's just clamouring for a
good time. You see, my brother's trouble was simply this: being so good
at stirring people up and making them think seriously, he never
realized how they flopped again when he had left them."</p>

<p>Victor explained the aims and methods of that great venture of
education in the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The problem was very
different from the civilian one, with which he was so familiar. For the
civilian audiences, attendance at classes was of course voluntary, and
those who came were all drawn by some sort of desire for education,
however vague a desire. The service audiences were mostly audiences of
educational conscripts. In the early days, apparently, Victor often
found himself faced with a group who had no interest whatever in the
matter in hand. They regarded the occasion simply as an opportunity for
idleness or even sleep. Sometimes there was open hostility. People
would ostentatiously read a paper, or snore, until a sergeant
intervened. Or they would sit with their backs to the lecturer. There
could not have been a worse atmosphere for education. "But after all,"
he said, "the situation was a challenge. Somehow one had to make those
people glad they had been forced to come. No doubt my other self always
succeeded. But for me it was necessary to learn the right technique
very laboriously. One had to combine school-boy humour with
unmistakable sincerity and enthusiasm for the subject. No wonder in
those early days the atmosphere sometimes cowed me completely. Then the
whole affair would be simply a nightmare. However, as time passed, the
troops themselves got more used to the idea of serious discussion, and
we lecturers got more skilled. Latterly I generally came away with a
feeling that on the whole something worth while had been accomplished.
And occasionally even I had the exciting experience of seeing those
ordinary beer- drinking, pin-up-girl connoisseurs and football fans
begin to sit up and take notice, and fire off volleys of questions or
comments. But this was rare."</p>

<p>It was clear that my companion had a gnawing sense of failure. "I
ask myself," he said, "did I in any of those meetings give anyone the
beginnings of a real longing for the life of the mind. One or two, here
and there, perhaps. And perhaps one or two would be just very slightly
more tolerant and understanding than they could have been otherwise.
Perhaps! That is what one hopes for as the result of all that
travelling about in crowded wartime trains, in planes, in Army trucks,
R.A.F. trucks, Navy trucks, to remote batteries, searchlight sites,
camps, islands. It wouldn't be so horribly depressing if I didn't know
that my 'brother' would have done it all incomparably better. He would
always hold their attention, always give them something worth while,
always leave a lasting effect. Damn him!"</p>

<p>The weather had greatly deteriorated, and conversation petered out.
The wind was biting, and sleet was beginning to drive into our faces.
Those Yorkshire moors have a restrained grandeur of their own, and bad
weather enhances it. The snow added to their severe beauty; and to our
discomfort, for as soon as we left the path, we found ourselves in
difficulties. We came into a region of innumerable peat hags, miniature
canyons, the bottoms of which were black bog or peat. They were now
partly filled with snowdrifts. Then came a blizzard of blinding sleet,
and presently a heavy cloud swept along the moor and engulfed us.
Conversation had ceased. We were far too busy floundering in concealed
holes or leaping from tussock to tussock. Presently Victor stopped and
said, "We shall get hopelessly lost in this mist. Let's give up the
round, and go back to the car." I was quite glad to do so, but rather
surprised that Victor, the more active of us, should lose heart so
easily. Neither of his two personalities had been easily daunted by
physical discomforts or risks.</p>

<p>Victor must have sensed my surprise; for he said, "I suppose it's a
bit pusillanimous to turn back, but why should two old buffers like us
go floundering on in this uncomfortable mess? This weather might have
been exhilarating thirty years ago, but at our age it's too much of a
good thing. Besides," he laughed nervously, "it frightens me." Of
course I raised no objection to turning, but as we retraced our steps I
asked him what he meant by saying he was frightened. I could not see
any danger. "Of course there's none, really," he answered. "We can
easily make our way down into some valley or other even if we do get
lost. But--well, the whole scene is too poignantly symbolical of the
universe. The desolation of these sweeping moors, the savage sleet, the
labour of every step, the early darkness, the whole physical world's
complete indifference to man, the way man himself has messed up
everything, for instance in that derelict camp. The fact is, life is
getting me down, and any little thing can take the lid off hell for me.
Everything is so bleak and hopeless, everything. And I do everything in
such a second-class blindfold way. Fancy never having got beyond being
a journeyman in adult education after all these years!"</p>

<p>I protested that things were not nearly so bad as he thought. Surely
Victor had had his share of good fortune-a useful job well done, a
splendid wife, and a family that did them both credit. Almost with
resentment he said, "Oh, of course I ought not to complain. I'm well,
have enough to live on, and am harmlessly occupied: And of course
Maggie is superb. I shudder to think what I should have been without
her. She is incomparably the best thing in my life. But all the while I
know I'm not really what she wants. Yon see, after all, she's simply
far too good for me. She really does love me; I know; but always she
longs for that other Victor. Christ! How I hate my better self
sometimes!"</p>

<p>We walked on in silence for a while. Presently Victor continued,
"And then there's Colin. He's a fine lad, I know; but I just can't make
head or tail of him. Except of course that he sees through his wretched
father pretty thoroughly. How could he help it, after my unsatisfactory
behaviour to him while he was a child! Now, of course, I have learnt
sense, but it's too late. He just gangs his ane gait. If ever I try to
advise he is painfully polite and really takes no notice at all. Indeed
he is always so considerate that I feel he is treating me as a mental
patient. Sometimes I could wring his neck. Then Sheila! Certainly an
attractive girl, isn't she; but in no real sense my daughter. She is
quite simply not interested in me. But Margaret-- she's really mine,
and I think I live in her more than in anything else. I didn't damage
her as I damaged Colin. And I can appreciate her. And I, myself, begat
her. She's not the other's child. We're very good friends, as you know.
But she knows quite well by now that I'm a man beaten by his own
shortcomings. She still has a real affection for me, but she admires
only my 'brother'. Oh, yes, she is beginning to see through me already.
And now, of course, I'm getting old. I might be her grandfather. I
can't help her as much as I used to. Soon she'll leave me far
behind."</p>

<p>All that Victor had said was in a way true, but I felt unreasonably
annoyed with him for being so depressed about it, and for dragging it
into the open, so that I had to make some comment. The root of the
trouble seemed to me to be that he was too self-absorbed, and too
conscious of his inferiority to the true Victor. Somehow I didn't feel
like telling him this.</p>

<p>Victor continued, "There's a coherent pattern in your life. In mine
there's only a chaos of abortive patterns. But I'm not claiming to be
uniquely unfortunate. The plain fact is that all men are unhappy in one
way or another. At least I have never found anyone who wasn't. Get them
talking, and people all confess to some gnawing misery or other; except
those that are ashamed of it, or so frightened they can't admit it even
to themselves." I protested against this fantastic idea; and he
admitted he might be exaggerating. "No doubt," he said, "the death-
wish is warping my judgment. Intellectually, and even in a way
spiritually, I know (at least I sometimes know) that to give up would
be treason to the spirit; but my terrible fatigue and disillusionment
keep spawning arguments for death."</p>

<p>We walked in silence for a while, for the blizzard had redoubled its
force, and conversation was impossible. When respite came, I babbled
vaguely of the loveliness of the world. The English countryside, I
said, even in this harsh weather, was enough to hold me to life, no
matter how depressing my personal career. He said, "One can't live for
scenery." I tried another line. I argued that, even if as an individual
one was futile, yet in a way one was more than an individual, having a
part in the great struggle of humanity to find its soul. He laughed
bitterly. "It's not finding its soul," he said. "It's damning itself.
Within fifty years' time it will probably have wiped itself right off
the planet with atomic warfare. But look! Why is it that all
individuals today, at least all who are socially conscious, are in one
way or another tortured by social guilt? Because whatever they do is
fatally false, falsified by the pressure of an utterly false society.
If you live solely for individual contacts and personal service, then
you betray your obligation to the suffering millions with whom you have
no contact. If you live for economic or social and political action to
cure the sick world, then, either you will be entirely ineffective, or
else you will gain power, and so be corrupted by power; and then you
will contribute to the burden of the institutionalism and mechanized
tyranny that is turning all men into robots. If you withdraw from the
world to purge your soul of the world's poison, seeking a lone
salvation in religious discipline and contemplation, then again you
betray your immediate obligation to your fellows, even if you
innocently suppose you will discover truth invaluable to a future
generation. No! As I see it, do what you will, you are damned, just
because you are all of a piece with a damned world, a damned species.
No wonder death is coming to seem more and more desirable."</p>

<p>At this point I asked Victor if he had told Maggie about his death-
wish. He had not; and I urged him to do so, so that she could help him
to overcome it. "It would distress her," he said, "and she wouldn't
understand. She's so wedded to life."</p>

<p>Brushing aside this interruption, he continued, "Probably the root
of the whole trouble is that as a species we are neither fish, flesh,
fowl, nor good red herring; neither sheer brute nor fully personal. As
some writer or other said (perhaps Wells), man is not perfected for
flight in his chosen element, like the bird; he's just a clumsy first
experiment, like the old flying lizards. And like them he will sooner
or later come to grief. My 'brother' is probably an earnest of the
higher type that might be able to make a good thing of this planet. The
rest of us are poor tortured misfits. But the chances are that his type
will never establish itself. And even if it does, it will probably
complicate its world society to such an extent that it will be beaten
by circumstances, just as we are being beaten on our more lowly plane.
But, anyhow, what does it matter? In my clearest, coldest moments I
begin to see that existence is in the last analysis simply pointless.
That is just what my hearty 'brother' in spite of his brilliance, can
never see."</p>

<p>This kind of talk filled me with despond, and with exasperation at
Victor. It was so devastatingly true; but I felt there must be an
effective answer to it. I longed for the true Victor to appear and
provide the answer. Indeed I felt that one breath from the other Victor
would dispel this fog that engulfed the poor secondary personality.
Presently it occurred to me to point out that if Victor (the present
Victor) really regarded his 'brother' as being gifted with a more
penetrating insight than his own, surely he must credit him with some
solid ground for optimism. To this my companion replied, "In theory you
are right. But he seems to me to be constantly misled by his own
personal beatitude. To him, with his fundamental peace of mind (however
caused) all is bound to seem ultimately for the best. But we who cannot
see his vision cannot really feel the ultimate rightness of things. And
it's no use pretending. Besides, he may be wrong. He may be merely
projecting his own well-being on the universe." I stammered something
about the lovely and glorious things in the universe redeeming the
evil. "After all," I said, "some things do matter. And you ought to be
content to have lived and worked for the things that matter."</p>

<p>"They matter," he replied, "to us; but we, perhaps, don't matter to
the universe. And anyhow I can't believe that I matter to anyone very
much."</p>

<p>"To Maggie," I protested. He answered quietly, "Not much, really. If
I were to fade out, finally giving place to my 'brother', she'd be
glad. And if I were to put an end to the two of us, she would merely be
upset at losing my 'brother' for ever. Frankly, I'd be glad to be done
with the whole business, if I could get out in some easy way. Tell me,
Harry! Do you find life still worth living?"</p>

<p>I thought before I answered. "Well," I said," I have no illusions
about my own importance, and if I were to find myself under sentence of
death tomorrow, I shouldn't really mind. But I should be a bit annoyed
all the same. Everything is so frightfully interesting. One's own life
has been pretty futile, of course; but the life of the species is so
exciting, and most of all in our own age."</p>

<p>He answered, "To me the whole of contemporary existence begins to
seem merely like the last and dullest scene of a rather tiresome play.
I want to get away and go to sleep."</p>

<p>For a long while we trailed down the moor in silence; till at last
we came out below the mist, and the murky valley spread out before us.
Presently we reached the car, and packed ourselves into it. (Our feet
left pools on the floorboards.) I was feeling thoroughly dejected, and
cross with Victor, and yet I couldn't produce a satisfactory answer to
his pessimism. But he, having got the matter off his chest, was
beginning to cheer up. He was obviously enjoying the driving. Here at
least was a job he liked and could do with precision and elegance.
Presently he said, "Sorry I was so gloomy. It's not really as bad as
all that, I know. I do feel it in my bones that things are worth while,
and that what my idealistic 'brother' calls 'the spirit' matters much
more than we do, and that one must go on blunderingly serving it. I
feel it in my bones; but O God, I can't feel it clearly and
commandingly."</p>

<p>Nothing else worth reporting happened during my visit. The awake
Victor did not put in an appearance. Maggie said she would telegraph to
me if he did so before my leave was finished; for I had a great desire
to see him again. I payed another short visit before I returned to
India, but the situation was much as it had been.</p>

<h2>12 - STRANGE TRIUMPH</h2>

<h4>From 1946 to 1948</h4>

<p>I RETURNED TO INDIA for a short spell of work before retiring to the
home country. My long stay in the East had already told on my health,
and I looked forward eagerly to some modest and unexacting job in
England to keep me going for a few years until the time should come to
retire completely from active life. I promised myself that I would
first take some post in England, something not too arduous, that would
allow me enough leisure to work up a full-length biography of Victor.
He had agreed to this project, on condition that the book should not be
published till after his death. If I should die first, which seemed to
me quite likely, the manuscript was to be held by my executors until
Victor had followed me. I looked forward to seeing much more of Victor
when I finally settled in England, and I hoped to gain a much more
intimate understanding of the true Victor's ideas. If he failed to
publish his ever-rewritten book before his death, I was to have the
task of editing it and publishing at least a large part of it
posthumously.</p>

<p>My plans were frustrated. Some nine months after my return to India
I received a disquieting letter from Maggie. Victor's condition seemed
to have deteriorated. He was faithfully continuing his work; and
indeed, when he had sufficient strength to carry out his teaching, he
was a more successful teacher than he had ever been; but he seemed to
be profoundly and morbidly depressed about himself and the world. He
was seriously overworking, both in preparing his official lectures and
in reading book after book on religious or philosophical subjects. He
generally stayed up half the night reading, or just thinking. Maggie
could not make up her mind whether he was heroically and forlornly
struggling to mimic his 'brother' by finding some great illumination,
or whether, on the contrary, he was rebelling against the resented
influence of the true Victor.</p>

<p>He had started a course of ruthless asceticism. Alcohol and tobacco
he had given up enirely. Food he had strictly rationed to something
much less than the official ration. He said that if the Germans had to
starve, so must he. Undernourishment had undermined his bodily health,
though (so he said) it was quickening his mind. All the same, Maggie
learned from his students that he was often too tired to cope with a
class properly. All occasional pleasures, such as films and plays,
motoring week-ends and country walks, he had abandoned. Had he wanted
to walk, he could not have done it, for he had no spare energy. Toward
Margaret, on whom till recently he had rather extravagantly doted, he
now maintained a strange aloofness, alternating with gleams of hungry
love. Toward Maggie herself, though he treated her with even more than
his habitual tenderness, he seemed at heart aloof. She had tried to
persuade him to tell her what was troubling him, but he refused to be
drawn. He insisted on sleeping in a separate room, because (so he said)
his nocturnal meditations would disturb her. He never laughed, never
smiled, save professionally at his classes. He had apparently lost all
interest in the life of the society in which he lived, and in the whole
surrounding universe. Even his work he performed rather as a discipline
than from a sense of its importance. His attention seemed wholly
withdrawn upon his own inner life. But this too, so far as she could
judge, gave him no real satisfaction. Maggie was, of course, greatly
distressed and frightened. She feared that sooner or later he would
have a complete mental breakdown. In her letter to me, she said, "My
poor Victor is desperately groping for the light, but I cannot help
feeling that the powers of darkness, whatever they maybe, are closing
in on him. I think he is putting up a great fight against them, but I
am sure he has chosen quite the wrong tactics. Nothing that I can say
succeeds in persuading him to live more naturally and openly. Oh, how I
long for the return of my own true Victor I But it is now an age since
he came, and I begin to fear I shall never see him again."</p>

<p>A few months after receiving this letter, I was shocked by a cable
from Magpie announcing Victor's death: An airmail letter followed,
saying that one morning he had failed to appear at breakfast, so she
went up to his room, and found him apparently asleep; but he was dead.
A post mortem proved that he had taken one of the modern poisons which
send one quietly to sleep, never to wake again. He had left no last
message for her. And she found that all the true Victor's manuscripts
had been destroyed. She greatly blamed herself, for having agreed, some
ten years earlier, to restore them all to the study, where the
secondary Victor (by then a reformed character) could examine them
whenever he was in the mood for it.</p>

<p>The disaster of Victor's death, Maggie said, was the more
distressing because the true Victor had recently appeared rather more
frequently, and his last visit had been prolonged for more than a week.
She had begun to hope for his permanent re-establishment. He had told
her of the other's intention to kill himself, and she had been
anxiously watching him. On one occasion an attempt had actually been
made; but in the nick of time the true Victor had re-appeared. She
therefore hoped that this happy issue would be repeated whenever the
impulse for suicide recurred. In this, alas, she was mistaken.</p>

<p>A long letter from the true Victor, she said, was on its way to me.
But it had been sent by the sea mail, and might not reach me for some
time.</p>

<p>Maggie allows me to quote the closing passage of her letter to me.
"From the bottom of my heart I am thankful for my life with Victor. We
both suffered very much. And in the end came a dismal tragedy. But in
spite of everything, I feel that the true Victor has won through. In
our last week together we were happy, more happy than ever before. He
seemed to have an ecstatic peace which was infectious. He was telling
me about it, but he disappeared before he had made me fully understand.
But I have felt that peace. And now I feel--well, grief, of course,
since I shall never see my darling again; but not grief only. Much
deeper in my heart, I feel joy. Somehow, in the last week he taught me
more than in the whole of the rest of his life. And perhaps he himself
learned more. He has tried to express something of this in his letter
to you, but words can give only a pale ghost of the peace and joy which
his presence radiated through and through me during those most happy
days. And even now that he is gone, I feel convinced that in some sense
beyond my intelligence he is always with me; he, the true Victor, my
pride and my joy."</p>

<p>In due course I received Victor's letter. I will end this inadequate
biography of my friend by quoting his last letter in full. It is a
remarkable and a moving document. Parts of it are either beyond my
comprehension or else sheer verbiage. The reader must judge for
himself. My own feeling about it is that while the letter shows the
potential greatness of my dead friend, both in intelligence and in
large-heartedness and spiritual vision (if I may so put the matter), it
also shows considerable traces of mental derangement, due, no doubt, to
the strain of his situation. The opening reference to myself, far
kinder than I deserve, shows Victor's unfailing magnanimity.</p>

<p>"DEAR HARRY.</p>

<p>"It is unlikely that we shall meet again, and I feel I must say
something to you before it is too late.</p>

<p>"First of all, Harry, I want to say' thank you' for your friendship,
your patience and kindness through all the years since we were at
Oxford. I have never said anything like this to you before. I have
always counted on you. I have always accepted from you without any
spoken gratitude. And often I have been inconsiderate and impatient.
For this I cannot make amends; but let me at least say that our
friendship has been one of the happiest and most valued things in my
life, and that you, more than anyone else, have taught me what the
relation between man and man should be.</p>

<p>"I woke a few days ago in strange circumstances. I was in bed in the
Dolt's room. In the palm of my hand there was a little white pill.
Thinking that it was an aspirin, I put it in my mouth. But the Dolt's
memories were now flooding back on me, and I quickly realized that he
had decided to kill us both. I hastily spat out the pill and rinsed my
mouth. My watch told me it was half-past one. I went to Maggie's
room.</p>

<p>"If he does it again, shall I again wake in time to thwart him? I
cannot feel confident of it. The knowledge that this may be my last few
days of life seems to have intensified my vitality. Everything that
happens to me, everything that I do, has a new meaning, and glows (so
to speak) with an inner light.</p>

<p>"We have seized the opportunity of a complete holiday in this
glorious English spring. (Fancy my fool 'brother' wanting to kill
himself and me in this weather, with all the buds bursting!) We have
been out in the country every day. I don't know which is more
delightful, lying on one's back in a field, with Maggie, and listening
to larks and an early cuckoo, or swinging across the moor, with Maggie,
watching the cloud shadows on the hills, and an occasional hare start
up and streak away round the hill's shoulder. 'Swinging across the
moor' is a very false image. 'Painfully plodding' would be better; for
the Dolt had been starving our common body. But now, there's some sort
of fire in me that drives the body far beyond its natural strength.</p>

<p>"What a joy seeing is! Even when it is done through aging eyes that
give neither the precision nor the brilliance of childhood's seeing.
The poor old physical instrument is no longer 'optically perfect', but
the relish, the zest, is as fresh and breathtaking as it was in my
still-remembered babyhood. O lovely world; tragic, sordid, brutal, and
yet lovely! The sturdy hog-backs of the moors! The frail geometry of a
spider's web! This morning I was making the porridge for breakfast.
Have you ever noticed how at a certain stage the quick waves of gruel
gradually turn to heavy, sluggish, velvet foldings? Rather like the
smooth hide rippling on a puma's shoulders. Then the stuff boils.
Subterranean explosions in the little molten world form ephemeral
craters. You watch the show, fascinated, till a projectile of lava
rises into the stratosphere and scalds your hand. Strange how even pain
itself has a sort of tigerish loveliness! I mean, when one is really
awake, and can experience it with a full sense of its spiritual
meaning. But alas, alas! Man can only reach this all-redeeming
illumination in his rare and precarious moments of full consciousness.
And most of us are doomed never to reach so far. This is the ultimate
tragedy at the heart of the universe. Ultimate? No! Seeming ultimate,
only while one is in the trance of lonely selfhood. But In fact we are
indeed all members one of another, and of the Whole. Even the least of
us is at heart the Whole. And in the Whole's glory his suffering is
redeemed. But, oh, Harry, how I stammer and drivel, trying to express
the inexpressible that I have indeed, though darkly, seen."</p>

<p>"In these few happy days that have been given me, I spend much of my
time just looking at things. For instance at Maggie. Aging suits her.
She was lovely when I first saw her, so many years ago; but now, though
she has lost all the sweet physical freshness, in another way she's
lovelier. The spirit, one might say, shines so clearly through that
experienced, that tempered and beautifully weathered smile. If only she
could enjoy the present fully, without thought of the future, or
without fear of the future! I must show her how to do that before I go.
I shall succeed. I shall teach her to see everything from the point of
view of eternity. In these few days we are creating something eternally
lovely. We are completing our thank-offering to eternity. Our music
rises to its last triumphant note. I hope, indeed I am sure, that when
I am gone you and Maggie will be very close friends. I am not
commending her to your care, for she is strong, and I have no fears for
her. But your friendship will mean much to her.</p>

<p>"And the children! That's a joy you have missed, Harry, watching
children grow, and being glad to be needed by them, and glad to watch
them be themselves, and not what one had wanted them to be. I find it
hard to forgive my accursed other self for harming them. Colin will
bear the marks for ever. There's a wry twist in his character, a streak
of cynicism that need not have been. But he's tough and sane, and
complete master of himself. And even the Dolt's clumsy treatment could
not seriously mar the gentleness that Maggie taught him. Sheila, bless
her, is less damaged. I know no one, not even Maggie, more serene. As
for that diabolically attractive minx, Margaret, I expect she'll be all
right when she has got over the spoiling that the doting Dolt slopped
over her till quite recently. Of course she hardly knows me. And she's
piqued because I don't fuss over her.</p>

<p>"How exquisite every moment of experience is! Even such a little
thing as the forming of these words with my pen! See! This bit of
handwriting shall be a real work of art, in its little way; precise but
fluent. Each letter's economical form echoes so much of history,
monkish, Roman, Greek, Phoenician, and Egyptian. How long, I wonder,
will men continue to Use symbols formed in this great tradition? Will
man in the end outgrow the need for writing? Or will man and writing
cease together? Well, I may not use these signs much longer. This may
be the last time I shall practise this homely, lovely art. Meanwhile,
since writing is the matter in hand, I will delight in conforming to
its canons. Strange, how even in the careful forming of a single word
(that word 'strange' for instance) we can express so much yet fall so
short of our intention!</p>

<p>"I am writing in my little study. At bottom it is my study, not the
Dolt's. I chose the furniture, and placed it conveniently. But my other
self has been in possession so long that he has largely imposed his
character on the room. There's a picture of his, sophisticatedly
modern, but not quite sincere. There's a pile of back numbers of the
Autocar--not mine at all.</p>

<p>"On my desk, here, there's a folded newspaper. Bad paper, smudgy
printing, incredibly vulgar advertisements. A symbol of all that is
driving my other self to suicide. And yet--I can forgive the thing its
wretchedness. Seen as the focal point of a vast tragic symbolism, it
becomes strangely beautiful in its pathetic vulgarity. And the poor
trapped souls that produced it--I don't insult them with forgiveness; I
just salute them as fellow mortals. There's a very bad drawing of a
girl in her undies, advertising nylons. Her sex, of course, is wildly
exaggerated. Face, laughably debased-lovely. Breasts, pert. Figure, too
slim; legs far too long for body. Every line of the drawing, falsely
slick. The whole thing is loathsome, of course; but, oh, pathetic! Look
hard into it, and you can see the real loveliness that it garbles.
Strangely, you can see in it the spirit battling vainly for life
against the choking horror of our civilization, against commercialism's
fatal exaggeration of self-interest, of self-display, of self-regarding
sexuality. Strange how, in the light of the Whole, the ugly thing
itself borrows beauty! Not that we should therefore tolerate it or
preserve it; for its virtue lies in its ugliness, in its failure to be
beautiful. And the same of evil. In the light of the Whole it is
transfigured, redeemed. Not that it is therefore to be tolerated; for
its virtue dies in its essential badness, in its tragic failure to be
good. In action, our allegiance to the spirit obliges us to struggle
with all our strength against evil; and yet in contemplation, when the
majestic pregnancy of the Whole obscurely reveals itself to us, and
worship is wrung from us, we cannot but accept, and with joy.</p>

<p>"Inevitably the horror of our civilization and of the whole
universe, drives the poor blind Dolt to suicide. But that is not what
it does to me.. This vulgar little drawing, the whole vulgar tragedy of
our civilization--though in action I oppose them all with all my
strength, in contemplation 1 find myself accepting them reverently,
perhaps quite irrationally. I respect them as I respect a man
struggling against a mortal disease or incipient insanity. Because
everywhere the spirit shows through, struggling for the light, and yet
fatally slipping, slipping, farther down into darkness. To hell with
the poor Dolt's death-wish, where indeed it belongs. My wish is wholly
for life, life eternal, not just for my own little individuality, which
is essentially and rightly ephemeral, but for the spirit that is the
perennial and Cosmical music inherent in the lives of all ephemeral
individuals.</p>

<p>"Maggie is all the while with me in my study. For I must have all I
can of her, and she of me, while it is possible. She is sewing. Her
needle moves in and out of the material as she takes up a needleful of
stitches. It's like a line of little glistening porpoises threading
across a white sea. My life with her has been like that--in and out, in
and out. Latterly, alas, mostly out. And now all our intermittent days,
weeks, months, and our too few years, come crowding into memory. I
examine the stitches of our past. So irregular, but such a bright
thread! Compared with the young waitress of so long ago she's
physically mere smouldering ash, left after a blazing fire. But to the
seeing eye there's another light irradiating the dear dying ash. The
Dolt, poor fool, could never properly see that light. He does begin to
appreciate Maggie, does love her in a way, but never as she deserves.
Incredible to me that living with Maggie, year in and year out,
couldn't kill his death-wish! When I think of him as my own baser self,
how I loathe him! But when I think of him as something other than me, a
poor blind creature vainly groping for the light, I pity him. I even
respect him, for in his fumbling way, he put up a good fight, against
odds that I never had to face.</p>

<p>"I ask you, Harry, to cast your mind back to that dismal walk you
had with me, with my Dolt self, I mean, on the moor in a blizzard. He
(or I) bemused you with his plausible death-excuses! What he said was
all true in a way, but all half-truth. True, that man's plight is grim.
True that poisoned institutions poison all our minds, and falsify every
possible act. But we are not doomed. A world where there is sunshine,
and where people sometimes love, sometimes think honestly, sometimes
make glorious things, is not doomed. Our fate depends at least in part
on ourselves; or rather, not simply on our poor frail individualistic
selves, but on the strength of the universal spirit in us. Lest you
should think I'm going back on my agnosticism, believe me I don't mean
by 'universal spirit', a universal 'being' or soul or person; I still
mean just the ideal of spiritual living that beckons all half-awakened
beings and claims possession of them. Maybe there's more to it than
that. Maybe there is the universal soul or person or God. But since we
don't know, and cannot know (being only the poor little insects that we
are), let us for God's sake (or for the spirit's sake) be true to our
own little insect intelligence, and not pre tend we understand what is
beyond our understanding.</p>

<p>"Out of the horror of our contemporary world, out of our sense of
doom, our doltish nightmare, comes a new hope of true waking. The war
was an alarm clock that disturbed our sleep. We are at last
sufficiently shocked for waking; and if we will, we can now wake
properly. And people are waking. I saw it whenever I took over the
Dolt's discussions with soldiers and airmen. Those groups of bewildered
sleep-walkers were all restless for waking, all shyly groping for the
light, even when they pretended still to be cynics. Of course, the
whole thing may go awry. People may all be drugged into sleep again, or
we may wreck the planet with atomic power, before the new temper can
take effect. But now, at least there is the widespread waking, and at
least the possibility of a new world. Strange glorious changes are
striving for birth. God! Far from wishing death, I should be glad of a
new lease of life, a second and a third lifetime, to play some part in
the great waking. I long for it; and yet, while I am fully awake, I
find I gladly accept whatever comes. Of course, even if at last mankind
does win through, there'll be no Utopia but only a widespread breaking
through into rather more lucid experience and more creative ways of
living. There'll be new problems, new conflicts, new hopes and
despairs, new joys and agonies. There'll be merely an outgrowing of
nursery troubles and infantile growing pains and diseases, and at last
a hesitant, precarious, painful, dangerous staggering into a world of
adult experience.</p>

<p>"But let us for the sake of argument suppose that the very worst
does happen, and that within a quarter of a century, or a quarter of a
year, mankind destroys itself, and lethal radiation turns the whole
surface of the earth into a desert, inhospitable to life--what then?
Were those who foresaw it fools to remain alive, vainly striving
against it? No! Even the destruction of a living world is worth living
through, however painful; if one is awake, if one can see the disaster
as an episode in the perennial struggle of the spirit in the
innumerable successive hosts of individuals in all the worlds. My own
life has been mainly a dismal failure, and yet it was infinitely worth
living. And if mankind fails, yet mankind has been infinitely worth
while. Already, and whatever happens, this planet, this grain that
spawned our imperfect kind, is well justified. The solar system, the
whole universe, is well justified; yes, even if man is the only, and a
sadly imperfect, vessel of the spirit, and doomed. For no tragedy, not
even a cosmical tragedy, can wipe out what man (in his low degree) has
in fact achieved, through the grace of his vision of the spirit, his
precarious and yet commanding vision of the spirit.</p>

<p>"But how unlikely that man is the sole vessel! Consider the pregnant
stars! Consider the great galaxies I Can any sane mind then suppose
that man is the sole vessel?</p>

<p>"And I must tell you again, Harry, that in my sadly curtailed
spiritual researches and exercises, though I have had little success,
at least I have won through (by the grace of the spirit) to feel the
indescribable unity that comprises all our severalness. And in my dim
sense of that unity of all spirit I have heard (so to speak) the faint,
far-off murmur of the hosts of individual lives throughout the cosmos
and the aeons. And I have felt--but once more language utterly fails,
and thinking also. And yet, though what I have felt beyond that
cosmical murmur is really beyond all telling, I find I must stammer out
something about it, however misleadingly. I have felt--oh, how can I
put it without falsifying it utterly? I have felt all baseness and
pain, and all sorrow, transmuted into glory; all agony, from the pain-
flash of a crushed fly to the despair of Jesus on the Cross, turn to
joy. But what am I saying? Of course I don't mean that the poor little
tortured fly and the tragic disillusioned Jesus and all other sufferers
enter severally into everlasting bliss, as individuals. Maybe in some
strange sense they do, though it must be a sense quite unsatisfying to
those who clamour for individual salvation. But all this is beside the
point. The news I am trying to report to you is something of a
different kind. Perhaps I can give a hint of it by saying simply that
nothing is merely lost. Everything contributes. All the agonies, and
the joys too, are gathered up into the whole single music of existence,
the music which enjoys itself. And so the agony, which in the
loneliness of our finite individuality is unredeemed and hideous and
meaningless, contributes to the music, is significant; and in
consciousness of its own significance in the whole it is itself
transfigured into joy. All this talk, you may say, is sheer verbiage.
And of course it is, if you are looking for literal truth. But I know,
I know now, that it is poetically true, like the statement that the
sun, when he pushes the clouds aside, laughs.</p>

<p>"After re-reading that paragraph I fear it will mean nothing to you.
But in its halting way it does mean something to me, in virtue of my
actual experience. Does it to you?</p>

<p>"But, Harry, before I say 'goodbye', I must say one other thing.
This cosmical transfiguration of all our experience is something quite
apart from individual survival of death, whether survival for a while
only or for ever. The transfiguration I now know to be true, but I
cannot describe it or even clearly think it. Survival, on the other
hand, is an intelligible idea, up to a point; but I have no news to
give of it. Maybe death is simply the complete ending of us; and if so,
let us be grateful for eternal sleep. Maybe we go on from aeon to aeon
in subsequent temporal lives, within this formidable universe, for the
progressive fashioning of our individual souls; so that ultimately each
may contribute fully to the music. Such 're- incarnation' is a
possibility that may well daunt us, in view of the weariness that comes
to one toward the end even of this single life. But perhaps we start
the next one refreshed. And how exhilarating, provided one had the
opportunity for creative work! But should I find Maggie? (God! I should
want her!) Maybe I should and I shouldn't. Well, I'm for the venture!
(What a jest if the Dolt wakes up and finds himself living again! He'd
be as sick as a dog!) Then there's another possibility. Maybe we wake
in some completely other temporal and spatial (or non-spatial) system
of existence, made not of stars and the void, of light and dark and
pressure and all our sense characters, but of something--inconceivable
to us. Or again, maybe at death we are gathered up at once into
eternity. Annihilated as individuals, maybe we wake to remember that
all along we have been the eternal spirit, the world soul, or God.
Maybe, maybe! But what does it matter? The important thing is that,
whatever happens to us as individuals, the spirit does matter, and the
spirit is; though even after all those years of puzzling I'm damned if
I can say what it is; except that it is just what we all (when we are
properly awake) know does matter, just awareness, love and creative
action in relation to an objective universe.</p>

<p>"But I still haven't said what I wanted to say. It's this. If I do
survive, I shall do my best to make some sort of contact with Maggie,
and with you too, Harry, you old sceptic. So, both of you, please keep
an ear open for the telephone bell, so to speak. I may have something
important to say. I have told her I shall put a call through to her, if
I possibly can. Unless, of course, I become so thoroughly absorbed in
the affairs of that other world that I simply forget all about this
one; and all about Maggie. But if I do that, shall I be 'I' at all, in
any important sense? Surely the surviving thing could not be 'I' if it
cared no more for Maggie, if it looked askance at the whole loveliness
and horror of this world, and the whole struggle of mankind. And yet--
suppose, when one entered another sphere of being, one were to see
clearly that any harking back to this world was a desertion of the
other world, and that the spirit must be expressed independently in
each? Who knows! But the one supreme thing is sure--the intrinsic and
paramount excellence of the spirit, and its fundamental identity in all
worlds. Whatever our individual fate, this is enough to make our lives
worth while."</p>

<p>"As for me, I find myself entirely reconciled to any of the fates
that are surmised. Mr expectation, on the whole, is that when I have
died there will be no actual 'I' Victor Smith', any more; though
perhaps some queer fragments of my memories may haunt people in this
world for a while, like disembodied dreams flitting from mind to mind.
But this is unimportant.</p>

<p>"Well, there it is! Goodbye, Harry! Whatever happens, the universe
contains you and me eternally as two individual fibres in its texture,
and as their friendly contact. Those Oxford days of ours are part of
eternity; So are your forbearance and kindness on my abortive wedding
day, and all your patience, including your reading of this rather
chaotic letter. Enjoy your life's autumn! In a way I am sorry to miss
the last phase, for it might be the best of all. But no matter! All's
well.</p>

<p>"Good luck, and goodbye!"</p>

<p>"Victor"</p>
