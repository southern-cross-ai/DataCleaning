<h1>The Greek Poropulos</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Edgar Wallace</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<p>At Carolina, in the Transvaal, was a store kept by a man named
Lioski, who was a Polish Jew. There was an officers' clubhouse, the
steward of which was a Greek sportsman named Poropulos, and this
story is about these two men, and about an officer of Hampton's
Scouts who took too much wine and saw a pair of boots.</p>

<p>I have an intense admiration for George Poropulos, and I revere
his memory. I admire him for his nerve; though, for the matter of
that, his nerve was no greater than mine.</p>

<p>Long before the war came, when the negotiations between Great
Britain and the Transvaal Government were in the diplomatic stage, I
drifted to Carolina from the Rand, leaving behind me in the golden
city much of ambition, hope, and all the money I had brought with me
from England. I came to South Africa with a young wife and
&pound;370&mdash;within a few shillings&mdash;because the doctors
told me the only chance I had was in such a hot, dry climate as the
highlands of Africa afforded. For my own part, there was a greater
attraction in the possibility of turning those few hundreds of mine
into thousands, for Johannesburg was in the delirium of a boom.</p>

<p>I left Johannesburg nearly penniless. I could not, at the moment,
explain the reason of my failure, for the boom continued, and I had
the advantage of the expert advice of Arthur Lioski, who was staying
at the same boarding house as myself.</p>

<p>There were malicious people who warned me against Lioski. His own
compatriots, sharp men of business, told me to 'ware Lioski, but I
ignored the advice because I was very confident in my own judgment,
and Lioski was a plausible, handsome man, a little flashy in
appearance, but decidedly a beautiful animal.</p>

<p>He was in Johannesburg on a holiday, he said. He had stores in
various parts of the country where he sold everything from
broomsticks to farm wagons, and he bore the evidence of his
prosperity.</p>

<p>He took us to the theater, or rather he took Lillian, for I was
too seedy to go out much. I did not grudge Lillian the pleasure. Life
was very dull for a young girl whose middle-aged husband had a spot
on his lung, and Lioski was so kind and gentlemanly, so far as Lil
was concerned, that the only feeling I had in the matter was one of
gratitude.</p>

<p>He was tall and dark, broad-shouldered, with a set to his figure
and a swing of carriage that excited my admiration. He was possessed
of enormous physical strength, and I have seen him take two
quarreling Kaffirs&mdash;men of no ordinary muscularity&mdash;and
knock their heads together.</p>

<p>He had an easy, ready laugh, a fund of stories, some a little
coarse, I thought, and a florid gallantry which must have been
attractive to women. Lil always brightened up wonderfully after an
evening with him.</p>

<p>His knowledge of mines and mining propositions was bewildering. I
left all my investments in his hands, and it proves something of my
trust in him, that when, day by day, he came to me for money, to
"carry over" stock&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;I paid without
hesitation. Not only did I lose every penny I possessed, but I found
myself in debt to him to the extent of a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Poor Lil! I broke the news to her of my ruin, and she took it
badly; reproached, stormed, and wept in turn, but quieted down when I
told her that in the kindness of his heart, Lioski had offered me a
berth at his Carolina store. I was to get a &pound;16 a month, half
of which was to be paid in stores at wholesale prices and the other
half in cash. I was to live rent free in a little house near the
store. I was delighted with the offer. It was an immediate rise,
though I foresaw that the conditions of life would be much harder
than the life to which I had been accustomed in England. We traveled
down the Delagoa line to Middleburg, and found a Cape cart waiting to
carry us across the twenty miles of rolling veldt. The first six
months in Carolina were the happiest I have ever spent. The work in
the store was not particularly arduous. I found that it had the
reputation of being one of the best-equipped stores in the Eastern
Transvaal, and certainly we did a huge business for so small a place.
It was not on the town we depended, but upon the surrounding country.
Lioski did not come back with us, but after we had been installed for
a week he came and took his residence in the store.</p>

<p>All went well for six months. He taught Lil to ride and drive, and
every morning they went cantering over the veldt together. Me he
treated more like a brother than an employee, and I found myself
hotly resenting the uncharitable things that were said about him, for
Carolina, like other small African towns, was a hotbed of gossip.</p>

<p>Lil was happy for that six months, and then I began to detect a
change in her attitude toward me. She was snappy, easily offended,
insisted upon having her own room&mdash;to which I agreed, for,
although my chest was better, I still had an annoying cough at night
which might have been a trial to anybody within hearing.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I met Poropulos. He came into the
store on a hot day in January, a little man of forty-five or
thereabouts. He was unusually pale, and had a straggling, weedy
beard. His hair was long, his clothes were old and stained, and so
much of his shirt as was revealed at his throat was sadly in need of
laundering.</p>

<p>Yet he was cheerful and <i>debonair</i>&mdash;and singularly
flippant. He stalked in the store, looked around critically, nodded
to me, and smiled. Then he brought his <i>sjambok</i> down on the
counter with a smack.</p>

<p>"Where's Shylock?" he asked easily.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I was irritated.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mr. Lioski?"</p>

<p>"Shylock, I said," he repeated. "Shylockstein, the Lothario of
Carolina." He smacked the counter again, still smiling.</p>

<p>I was saved the trouble of replying, for at that moment Lioski
entered. He stopped dead and frowned when he saw the Greek.</p>

<p>"What do you want, you little beast," he asked harshly.</p>

<p>For answer, the man leaned up against the counter, ran his fingers
through his straggling beard, and cocked his head.</p>

<p>"I want justice," he said unctuously&mdash;"the restoration of
money stolen. I want to send a wreath to your funeral: I want to
write your biography&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Clear out," shouted Lioski. His face was purple with anger, and
he brought his huge fist down upon the counter with a crash that
shook the wooden building.</p>

<p>He might have been uttering the most pleasant of compliments, for
all the notice the Greek took.</p>

<p>Crash! went Lioski's fist on the counter.</p>

<p>Smash! came Poropulos's <i>sjambok</i>, and there was something
mocking and derisive in his action that made Lioski mad.</p>

<p>With one spring he was over the counter, a stride and he had his
hand on the Greek's collar&mdash;and then he stepped back quickly
with every drop of blood gone from his face, for the Greek's knife
had flashed under his eyes. I thought Lioski was stabbed, but it was
fear that made him white.</p>

<p>The Greek rested the point of the knife on the counter and
twiddled it round absentmindedly, laying his palm on the hilt and
spinning it with great rapidity.</p>

<p>"Nearly did it that time, my friend," he said, with a note of
regret, "nearly did it that time&mdash;I shall be hanged for you
yet."</p>

<p>Lioski was white and shaking.</p>

<p>"Come in here," he said in a low voice, and the little Greek
followed him to the back parlor. They were together for about an
hour; sometimes I could hear Mr. Lioski's voice raised angrily,
sometimes Poropulos's little laugh. When they came out again the
Greek was smiling still and smoking one of my employer's cigars.</p>

<p>"My last word to you," said Lioski huskily, "is this&mdash;keep
your mouth closed and keep away from me."</p>

<p>"And my last word to you," said Poropulos, jauntily puffing at the
cigar, "is this&mdash;turn honest, and enjoy a sensation."</p>

<p>He stepped forth from the store with the air of one who had gained
a moral victory.</p>

<p>I never discovered what hold the Greek had over my master. I
gatherered that at some time or another, Poropulos had lost money,
and that he held Lioski responsible.</p>

<p>In some mysterious way Poropulos and I became friends. He was an
adventurer of a type. He bought and sold indifferent mining
propositions, took up contracts, and, I believe, was not above
engaging in the Illicit Gold Buying business. His attitude to Lillian
was one of complete adoration. When he was with her his eyes never
left her face.</p>

<p>It was about this time that my great sorrow came to me. Lioski
went away to Durban&mdash;to buy stock, he said&mdash;and a few days
afterwards Lillian, who had become more and more exigent, demanded to
be allowed to go to Cape Town for a change.</p>

<p>I shall remember that scene.</p>

<p>I was at breakfast in the store when she came in. She was white, I
thought, but her pallor suited her, with her beautiful black hair and
great dark eyes.</p>

<p>She came to the point without any preliminary. "I want to go
away," she said.</p>

<p>I looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Go away, dear? Where?"</p>

<p>She was nervous. I could see that from the restless movement of
her hands.</p>

<p>"I want to go to&mdash;to Cape Town&mdash;I know a girl
there&mdash;I'm sick of this place&mdash;I hate it!"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot, and I thought that she was going to break
into a fit of weeping. Her lips trembled, and for a time she could
not control her voice.</p>

<p>"I am going to be ill if you don't let me go," she said at last.
"I can feel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the money, dear," I said, for it was distressing to me that I
could not help her toward the holiday she wanted.</p>

<p>"I can find the money," she said, in an unsteady voice. "I have
got a few pounds saved&mdash;the allowance you gave me for my
clothes&mdash;I didn't spend it all&mdash;let me go,
Charles&mdash;please, please!"</p>

<p>I drove her to the station, and took her ticket for Pretoria. I
would have taken her to the capital, but I had the store to attend
to.</p>

<p>"By the way, what will your address be?" I asked just as the train
was moving off.</p>

<p>She was leaning over the gate of the car platform, looking at me
strangely.</p>

<p>"I will wire it&mdash;I have it in my bag," she called out, and I
watched the tail of the train round the curve, with an aching heart.
There was something wrong; what it was I could not understand.
Perhaps I was a fool. I think I was.</p>

<p>I think I have said that I had made friends with Poropulos.
Perhaps it would be more truthful to say that he made friends with
me, for he had to break down my feeling of distrust and disapproval.
Then, again, I was not certain how Mr. Lioski would regard such a
friendship, but, to my surprise, he took very little notice of it or,
for the matter of that, of me.</p>

<p>Poropulos came into the store the night my wife left. Business was
slack; there was war in the air, rumors of ultimatums had been
persistent, and the Dutch farmers had avoided the store.</p>

<p>A week passed, and I began to worry, for I had not heard from Lil.
I had had a letter from Lioski, telling me that in view of the
unsettled condition of the country he was extending his stay in
Durban for a fortnight. The letter gave me the fullest instructions
as to what I was to do in case war broke out, but, unfortunately, I
had no opportunity of putting them into practice.</p>

<p>The very day I received the letter, a Boer commando rode into
Carolina, and at the head of it rode the Landrost Peter du Huis, a
pleasant man, whom I knew slightly. He came straight to the store,
dismounted, and entered.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Gray," he said. "I fear that I come on
unpleasant business."</p>

<p>"What is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have come to commandeer your stock in the name of the
Republic," he said, "and to give you the tip to clear out."</p>

<p>It does not sound possible, but it is nevertheless a fact that in
two hours I had left Carolina, leaving Lioski's store in the hands of
the Boers, and bringing with me receipts signed by the Landrost for
the goods he had commandeered. In four hours I was in a cattle truck
with a dozen other refugees on my way to Pretoria&mdash;for I had
elected to go to Durban to inform Lioski at first hand of what had
happened.</p>

<p>Of the journey down to the coast it is not necessary to speak. We
were sixty hours <i>en route</i>; we were without food, and had
little to drink. At Ladysmith I managed to get a loaf of bread and
some milk; at Maritzburg I got my first decent meal. But I arrived in
Durban, tired, dispirited, and hungry. Lioski was staying at the
Royal, and as soon as I got to the station I hailed a <i>ricksha</i>
to take me there.</p>

<p>There had been no chance of telegraphing. The wires were blocked
with government messages. We had passed laden troop trains moving up
to the frontier, and had cheered the quiet men in khaki who were
going, all of them, to years of hardship and privation, many of them
to death.</p>

<p>The vestibule of the Royal was crowded, but I made my way to the
office.</p>

<p>"Lioski?" said the clerk. "Mr. and Mrs. Lioski, No.
84&mdash;you'll find your way to their sitting room."</p>

<p>I went slowly up the stairs, realizing in a flash the
calamity.</p>

<p>I did not blame Lil; it was a hard life I had brought her to. I
had been selfish, as sick men are selfish, inconsiderate.</p>

<p>They stood speechless, as I opened the door and entered. I closed
the door behind me. Still they stood, Lil as pale as death, with
terror and shame in her eyes, Lioski in a black rage.</p>

<p>"Well?" It was he who broke the silence.</p>

<p>He was defiant, shameless, and as I went on to talk about what had
happened at the store, making no reference to what I had seen, his
lips curled contemptuously.</p>

<p>But Lil, womanlike, rushed in with explanations. She had meant to
go to Cape Town&mdash;the train service had been bad&mdash;she had
decided to go to Durban&mdash;Mr. Lioski had been kind enough to book
her a room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I let her go on. When she had finished I handed my receipts to
Lioski.</p>

<p>"That ends our acquaintance, I think."</p>

<p>"As you like," he replied with a shrug.</p>

<p>I turned to Lillian.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear," I said, but she made no move, and I saw Lioski
smile again.</p>

<p>I lost all control over myself and leaped at him, but his big fist
caught me before I could reach him, and I went down, half stunned. I
was no match for him. I knew that, and if the blow did nothing else,
it sobered me. I picked myself up. I was sick with misery and
hate.</p>

<p>"Come, Lil," I said again.</p>

<p>She was looking at me, and I thought I saw a look of disgust in
her face. I did not realize that I was bleeding, and that I must have
been a most unpleasant figure. I only knew that she loathed me at
that moment, and I turned on my heel and left them, my own wife and
the big man who had broken me.</p>

<p>One forgets things in war time. I joined the Imperial Light Horse
and went to the front. The doctor passed me as sound, so I suppose
that all that is claimed for the climate of Africa is true.</p>

<p>We went into Ladysmith, and I survived the siege. I was promoted
for bringing an officer out of action under fire. I earned a
reputation for daring, which I did not deserve, because always I was
courting swift death, and taking risks to that end.</p>

<p>Before Buller's force had pushed a way through the stubborn lines
to our relief, I had received my commission. More wonderful to me, I
found myself a perfectly healthy man, as hard as nails, as callous as
the most-experienced soldier. Only, somewhere down in my heart, a
little worm gnawed all the time; sleeping or waking, fighting or
resting, I thought of Lillian, and wondered, wondered, wondered.</p>

<p>Ladysmith was relieved. We marched on toward Pretoria. I was
transferred to Hampton's Horse with the rank of major, and for
eighteen months I moved up and down the Eastern Transvaal chasing a
will-othe-wisp of a commandant, who was embarrassing the blockhouse
lines.</p>

<p>Then one day I came upon Poropulos.</p>

<p>We were encamped outside Standerton when he rode in on a
sorry-looking Burnto pony. He had been in the country during the war,
he said, buying and selling horses. He did not mention Lioski's name
to me, and so studiously did he avoid referring to the man, that I
saw at once that he knew.</p>

<p>It was brought home to me by his manner that he had a liking for
me that I had never guessed. In what way I had earned his regard I
cannot say, but it was evident he entertained a real affection for
me.</p>

<p>We parted after an hour's chat&mdash;he was going back to
Carolina. He had a scheme for opening an officers' club in that town,
where there was always a large garrison, and to which the wandering
columns came from time to time to be re-equipped.</p>

<p>As for me, I continued the weary chase of the flying commando.
Trek, trek, trek, in fierce heat, in torrential downpour, over smooth
veldt and broken hills, skirmishing, sniping, and now and then a
sharp engagement, with a dozen casualties on either side.</p>

<p>Four months passed, and the column was ordered into Carolina for a
refit. I went without qualms, though I knew she was there, and Lioski
was there.</p>

<p>We got into Carolina in a thunderstorm, and the men were glad to
reach a place that bore some semblance of civilization. My brother
officers, after our long and profitless trek, were overjoyed at the
prospect of a decent dinner&mdash;for Poropulos's club was already
famous among the columns.</p>

<p>My horse picked up a stone and went dead lame, so I stayed behind
to doctor him, and rode to Carolina two hours after the rest of the
column had arrived.</p>

<p>It was raining heavily as I came over a fold of the hill that
showed the straggling township. There was no human being in sight
save a woman who stood by the roadside, waiting, and I knew
instinctively, long before I reached her, that it was Lillian. I
cantered toward her. Her face was turned in my direction, and she
stood motionless as I drew rein and swung myself to the ground.</p>

<p>She was changed, not as I expected, for sorrow and suffering had
etherealized her. Her big eyes burned in a face that was paler than
ever, her lips, once so red and full, were almost white.</p>

<p>"I have been waiting for you," she said.</p>

<p>"Have you, dear? You are wet."</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently. I slipped off my mackintosh and
put it about her.</p>

<p>"He has turned me out," she said.</p>

<p>She did not cry. I think she had not recovered from the shock.
Something stirred from the thin cloak she was wearing; a feeble cry
was muffled by the wrapping.</p>

<p>"I have got a little girl," she said, "but she is dying." She
began to cry silently, the tears running down her wet face in
streams.</p>

<p>I took her into Carolina, and found a Dutchwoman who put her and
the baby to bed, and gave her some coffee.</p>

<p>I went up to the officers' club just after sunset and met
Poropulos coming down.</p>

<p>He was in a terrible rage, and was muttering to himself in some
tongue I could not understand.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are!"&mdash;he almost spat the words in his
anger&mdash;"that dog Lioski&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about to say something, but checked himself. I think it was
about Lillian that he intended to speak at first, but he changed the
subject to another grievance. "I was brought before the magistrate
and fined &pound;100 for selling field-force tobacco. My club will be
ruined&mdash;Lioski informed the police&mdash;by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was incoherent in his passion. I gather that he had been
engaged in some shady business, and that Lioski had detected him. He
almost danced before me in the rain.</p>

<p>"Shylock dies tonight," he said, and waved his enemy out of the
world with one sweep of his hand. "He dies tonight&mdash;I am weary
of him&mdash;for eighteen&mdash;nineteen years I have known him, and
he's dirt right through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went out without another word. I stood on the slope of the hill
watching him.</p>

<p>I dined at the club, and went straight back to the house where I
had left my wife. She was sleeping&mdash;but the baby was dead. Poor
little mortal! I owed it no grudge, but I was glad when they told
me.</p>

<p>All the next day I sat by her bed listening to Lillian's
mutterings, for she was very ill. I suffered all the tortures of a
damned soul sitting there, for she spoke of Lioski&mdash;"Arthur" she
called him&mdash;prayed to him for mercy&mdash;told him she loved
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was late for dinner at the club. There was a noisy crowd there.
Young Harvey of my own regiment had had too much to drink, and I
avoided his table.</p>

<p>My hand shook as I poured out a glass of wine, and somebody
remarked on it.</p>

<p>I did not see Poropulos until the dinner was halfway through.
Curiously enough, I looked at the clock as he came in, and the hands
pointed to half past eight.</p>

<p>The Greek was steward of the club, and was serving the wine. He
was calm, impassive, remarkably serene, I thought. He exchanged jokes
with the officers who were grumbling that they had had to wait for
the fulfillment of their orders.</p>

<p>"It was ten to eight when I ordered this," grumbled one man.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Harvey, who had been regarding Poropulos with
drunken gravity, pointed downward.</p>

<p>"He's changed his boots," he said, and chuckled. Poropulos smiled
amiably and went on serving. "He's changed his boots!" repeated
Harvey, concentrating his mind upon trivialities as only a drunken
man can. The men laughed. "Oh, dry up, Harvey!" said somebody.</p>

<p>"He's changed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no further. Through the door came a military policeman,
splashed from head to foot with mud.</p>

<p>"District Commandant here, sir?" he demanded. "There's been a man
murdered."</p>

<p>"Soldier?" asked a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;storekeeper, name of Lioski&mdash;shot dead half an
hour ago."</p>

<p>I do not propose to tell in detail all that happened following
that. Two smart C. I. D. men came down from Johannesburg, made a few
inquiries, and arrested Poropulos. He was expecting the arrest, and
half an hour before the officers came he asked me to go to him.</p>

<p>I spent a quarter of an hour with him, and what we said is no
man's business but ours. He told me something that startled
me&mdash;he loved Lillian, too. I had never guessed it, but I did not
doubt him. But it was finally for Lillian's sake that he made me
swear an oath so dreadful that I cannot bring myself to write it
down&mdash;an oath so unwholesome, and so against the grain of a man,
that life after it could only be a matter of sickness and shame.</p>

<p>Then the police came and took him away.</p>

<p>Lioski had been shot dead in the store by some person who had
walked in when the store was empty, at a time when there was nobody
in the street. This person had shot the Jew dead and walked out
again. The police theory was that Poropulos had gone straight from
the club, in the very middle of dinner, had committed the murder, and
returned to continue his serving, and the crowning evidence was the
discovery that he had changed his boots between 7.30 and 8.30. The
mud-stained boots were found in a cellar, and the chain of evidence
was completed by the statement of a trooper who had seen the Greek
walking from the direction of the store, at 8.10, with a revolver in
his hand.</p>

<p>Poropulos was cheerful to the last&mdash;cheerful through the
trial, through the days of waiting in the fort at Johannesburg.</p>

<p>"I confess nothing," he said to the Greek priest. "I hated Lioski,
and I am glad that he is dead, that is all. It is true that I went
down to kill him, but it was too late."</p>

<p>When they pinioned him he turned to me.</p>

<p>"I have left my money to you," he said. "There is about four
thousand pounds. You will look after her."</p>
