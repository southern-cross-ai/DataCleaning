  <p class="first">PROFESSOR CHALLENGER was in the worst possible humour. As I
  stood at the door of his study, my hand upon the handle and my foot upon the
  mat, I heard a monologue which ran like this, the words booming and
  reverberating through the house:</p>

  <p>'Yes, I say it is the second wrong call. The second in one morning. Do you
  imagine that a man of science is to be distracted from essential work by the
  constant interference of some idiot at the end of a wire? I will not have it.
  Send this instant for the manager. Oh! you are the manager. Well, why don't
  you manage? Yes, you certainly manage to distract me from work the importance
  of which your mind is incapable of understanding. I want the superintendent.
  He is away? So I should imagine. I will carry you to the law courts if this
  occurs again. Crowing cocks have been adjudicated upon. I myself have
  obtained a judgement. If crowing cocks, why not jangling bells? The case is
  clear. A written apology. Very good. I will consider it. Good morning.'</p>

  <p>It was at this point that I ventured to make my entrance. It was certainly
  an unfortunate moment. I confronted him as he turned from the telephone
  &mdash;a lion in its wrath. His huge black beard was bristling, his great
  chest was heaving with indignation, and his arrogant grey eyes swept me up
  and down as the backwash of his anger fell upon me.</p>

  <p>'Infernal, idle, overpaid rascals!' he boomed. 'I could hear them laughing
  while I was making my just complaint. There is a conspiracy to annoy me. And
  now, young Malone, you arrive to complete a disastrous morning. Are you here,
  may I ask, on your own account, or has your rag commissioned you to obtain an
  interview? As a friend you are privileged &mdash;as a journalist you are
  outside the pale.'</p>

  <p>I was hunting in my pocket for McArdle's letter when suddenly some new
  grievance came to his memory. His great hairy hands fumbled about among the
  papers upon his desk and finally extracted a press cutting.</p>

  <p>'You have been good enough to allude to me in one of your recent
  lucubrations,' he said, shaking the paper at me. 'It was in the course of
  your somewhat fatuous remarks concerning the recent Saurian remains
  discovered in the Solenhofen Slates. You began a paragraph with the words:
  "Professor G.E. Challenger, who is among our greatest living
  scientists&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>'Well, sir?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Why these invidious qualifications and limitations? Perhaps you can
  mention who these other predominant scientific men may be to whom you impute
  equality, or possibly superiority to myself?'</p>

  <p>'It was badly worded. I should certainly have said: "Our greatest living
  scientist,"' I admitted. It was after all my own honest belief. My words
  turned winter into summer.</p>

  <p>'My dear young friend, do not imagine that I am exacting, but surrounded
  as I am by pugnacious and unreasonable colleagues, one is forced to take
  one's own part. Self-assertion is foreign to my nature, but I have to hold my
  ground against opposition. Come now! Sit here! What is the reason of your
  visit?'</p>

  <p>I had to tread warily, for I knew how easy it was to set the lion roaring
  once again. I opened McArdle's letter. 'May I read you this, sir? It is from
  McArdle, my editor.'</p>

  <p>'I remember the man &mdash;not an unfavourable specimen of his class.'</p>

  <p>'He has, at least, a very high admiration for you. He has turned to you
  again and again when he needed the highest qualities in some investigation.
  That is the case now.'</p>

  <p>'What does he desire?' Challenger plumed himself like some unwieldy bird
  under the influence of flattery. He sat down with his elbows upon the desk,
  his gorilla hands clasped together, his beard bristling forward, and his big
  grey eyes, half-covered by his drooping lids, fixed benignly upon me. He was
  huge in all that he did, and his benevolence was even more overpowering than
  his truculence.</p>

  <p>'I'll read you his note to me. He says:</p>

  <p class="letter">Please call upon our esteemed friend, Professor Challenger,
  and ask for his co-operation in the following circumstances. There is a
  Latvian gentleman named Theodore Nemor living at White Friars Mansions,
  Hampstead, who claims to have invented a machine of a most extraordinary
  character which is capable of disintegrating any object placed within its
  sphere of influence. Matter dissolves and returns to its molecular or atomic
  condition. By reversing the process it can be reassembled. The claim seems to
  be an extravagant one, and yet there is solid evidence that there is some
  basis for it and that the man has stumbled upon some remarkable
  discovery.</p>

  <p class="letter">I need not enlarge upon the revolutionary character of such
  an invention, nor of its extreme importance as a potential weapon of war. A
  force which could disintegrate a battleship, or turn a battalion, if it were
  only for a time, into a collection of atoms, would dominate the world. For
  social and for political reasons not an instant is to be lost in getting to
  the bottom of the affair. The man courts publicity as he is anxious to sell
  his invention, so that there is no difficulty in approaching him. The
  enclosed card will open his doors. What I desire is that you and Professor
  Challenger shall call upon him, inspect his invention, and write for the
  Gazette a considered report upon the value of the discovery. I expect to hear
  from you to-night.</p>

  <p class="letter">R. McArdle.</p>

  <p>'There are my instructions, Professor,' I added, as I refolded the letter.
  'I sincerely hope that you will come with me, for how can I, with my limited
  capacities, act alone in such a matter?'</p>

  <p>'True, Malone! True!' purred the great man. 'Though you are by no means
  destitute of natural intelligence, I agree with you that you would be
  somewhat overweighted in such a matter as you lay before me. These
  unutterable people upon the telephone have already ruined my morning's work,
  so that a little more can hardly matter. I am engaged in answering that
  Italian buffoon, Mazotti, whose views upon the larval development of the
  tropical termites have excited my derision and contempt, but I can leave the
  complete exposure of the impostor until evening. Meanwhile, I am at your
  service.'</p>

  <p>And thus it came about that on that October morning I found myself in the
  deep level tube with the Professor speeding to the North of London in what
  proved to be one of the most singular experiences of my remarkable life.</p>

  <p>I had, before leaving Enmore Gardens, ascertained by the much-abused
  telephone that our man was at home, and had warned him of our coming. He
  lived in a comfortable flat in Hampstead, and he kept us waiting for quite
  half an hour in his ante-room whilst he carried on an animated conversation
  with a group of visitors, whose voices, as they finally bade farewell in the
  hall, showed that they were Russians. I caught a glimpse of them through the
  half-opened door, and had a passing impression of prosperous and intelligent
  men, with astrakhan collars to their coats, glistening top-hats, and every
  appearance of that bourgeois well-being which the successful Communist so
  readily assumes. The hall door closed behind them, and the next instant
  Theodore Nemor entered our apartment. I can see him now as he stood with the
  sunlight full upon him, rubbing his long, thin hands together and surveying
  us with his broad smile and his cunning yellow eyes.</p>

  <p>He was a short, thick man, with some suggestion of deformity in his body,
  though it was difficult to say where that suggestion lay. One might say that
  he was a hunchback without the hump. His large, soft face was like an
  underdone dumpling, of the same colour and moist consistency, while the
  pimples and blotches which adorned it stood out the more aggressively against
  the pallid background. His eyes were those of a cat, and catlike was the
  thin, long, bristling moustache above his loose, wet, slobbering mouth. It
  was all low and repulsive until one came to the sandy eyebrows. From these
  upwards there was a splendid cranial arch such as I have seldom seen. Even
  Challenger's hat might have fitted that magnificent head. One might read
  Theodore Nemor as a vile, crawling conspirator below, but above he might take
  rank with the great thinkers and philosophers of the world.</p>

  <p>'Well, gentlemen,' said he, in a velvety voice with only the least trace
  of a foreign accent, 'you have come, as I understand from our short chat over
  the wires, in order to learn more of the Nemor Disintegrator. Is it so?'</p>

  <p>'Exactly.'</p>

  <p>'May I ask whether you represent the British Government?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all. I am a correspondent of the Gazette, and this is Professor
  Challenger.'</p>

  <p>'An honoured name &mdash;a European name.' His yellow fangs gleamed in
  obsequious amiability. 'I was about to say that the British Government has
  lost its chance. What else it has lost it may find out later. Possibly its
  Empire as well. I was prepared to sell to the first Government which gave me
  its price, and if it has now fallen into hands of which you may disapprove,
  you have only yourselves to blame.'</p>

  <p>'Then you have sold your secret?'</p>

  <p>'At my own price.'</p>

  <p>'You think the purchaser will have a monopoly?'</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly he will.'</p>

  <p>'But others know the secret as well as you.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir.' He touched his great forehead.</p>

  <p>'This is the safe in which the secret is securely locked &mdash;a better
  safe than any of steel, and secured by something better than a Yale key. Some
  may know one side of the matter: others may know another. No one in the world
  knows the whole matter save only I.'</p>

  <p>'And these gentlemen to whom you have sold it.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir; I am not so foolish as to hand over the knowledge until the
  price is paid. After that it is I whom they buy, and they move this safe' he
  again tapped his brow 'with all its contents to whatever point they desire.
  My part of the bargain will then be done &mdash;faithfully, ruthlessly done.
  After that, history will be made.' He rubbed his hands together and the fixed
  smile upon his face twisted itself into something like a snarl.</p>

  <p>'You will excuse me, sir,' boomed Challenger, who had sat in silence up to
  now, but whose expressive face registered most complete disapproval of
  Theodore Nemor, 'we should wish before we discuss the matter to convince
  ourselves that there is something to discuss. We have not forgotten a recent
  case where an Italian, who proposed to explode mines from a distance, proved
  upon investigation to be an arrant impostor. History may well repeat itself.
  You will understand, sir, that I have a reputation to sustain as a man of
  science &mdash;a reputation which you have been good enough to describe as
  European, though I have every reason to believe that it is not less
  conspicuous in America. Caution is a scientific attribute, and you must show
  us your proofs before we can seriously consider your claims.'</p>

  <p>Nemor cast a particularly malignant glance from the yellow eyes at my
  companion, but the smile of affected geniality broadened his face.</p>

  <p>'You live up to your reputation, Professor. I had always heard that you
  were the last man in the world who could be deceived. I am prepared to give
  you an actual demonstration which cannot fail to convince you, but before we
  proceed to that I must say a few words upon the general principle.</p>

  <p>'You will realize that the experimental plant which I have erected here in
  my laboratory is a mere model, though within its limits it acts most
  admirably. There would be no possible difficulty, for example, in
  disintegrating you and reassembling you, but it is not for such a purpose as
  that that a great Government is prepared to pay a price which runs into
  millions. My model is a mere scientific toy. It is only when the same force
  is invoked upon a large scale that enormous practical effects could be
  achieved.'</p>

  <p>'May we see this model?'</p>

  <p>'You will not only see it, Professor Challenger, but you will have the
  most conclusive demonstration possible upon your own person, if you have the
  courage to submit to it.'</p>

  <p>'If!' the lion began to roar. 'Your "if," sir, is in the highest degree
  offensive.'</p>

  <p>'Well, well. I had no intention to dispute your courage. I will only say
  that I will give you an opportunity to demonstrate It. But I would first say
  a few words upon the underlying laws which govern the matter.</p>

  <p>'When certain crystals, salt, for example, or sugar, are placed in water
  they dissolve and disappear. You would not know that they have ever been
  there. Then by evaporation or otherwise you lessen the amount of water, and
  lo! there are your crystals again, visible once more and the same as before.
  Can you conceive a process by which you, an organic being, are in the same
  way dissolved into the cosmos, and then by a subtle reversal of the
  conditions reassembled once more?'</p>

  <p>'The analogy is a false one,' cried Challenger. 'Even if I make so
  monstrous an admission as that our molecules could be dispersed by some
  disrupting power, why should they reassemble in exactly the same order as
  before?'</p>

  <p>'The objection is an obvious one, and I can only answer that they do so
  reassemble down to the last atom of the structure. There is an invisible
  framework and every brick flies into its true place. You may smile,
  Professor, but your incredulity and your smile may soon be replaced by quite
  another emotion.'</p>

  <p>Challenger shrugged his shoulders. 'I am quite ready to submit it to the
  test.'</p>

  <p>'There is another case which I would impress upon you, gentlemen, and
  which may help you to grasp the idea. You have heard both in Oriental magic
  and in Western occultism of the phenomenon of the apport when some object is
  suddenly brought from a distance and appears in a new place. How can such a
  thing be done save by the loosening of the molecules, their conveyance upon
  an etheric wave, and their reassembling, each exactly in its own place, drawn
  together by some irresistible law? That seems a fair analogy to that which is
  done by my machine.'</p>

  <p>'You cannot explain one incredible thing by quoting another incredible
  thing,' said Challenger. 'I do not believe in your apports, Mr. Nemor, and I
  do not believe in your machine. My time is valuable, and if we are to have
  any sort of demonstration I would beg you to proceed with it without further
  ceremony.'</p>

  <p>'Then you will be pleased to follow me,' said the inventor. He led us down
  the stair of the flat and across a small garden which lay behind. There was a
  considerable outhouse, which he unlocked and we entered.</p>

  <p>Inside was a large whitewashed room with innumerable copper wires hanging
  in festoons from the ceiling, and a huge magnet balanced upon a pedestal. In
  front of this was what looked like a prism of glass, three feet in length and
  about a foot in diameter. To the right of it was a chair which rested upon a
  platform of zinc, and which had a burnished copper cap suspended above it.
  Both the cap and the chair had heavy wires attached to them, and at the side
  was a sort of ratchet with numbered slots and a handle covered with
  indiarubber which lay at present in the slot marked zero.</p>

  <p>'Nemor's Disintegrator,' said this strange man, waving his hand towards
  the machine.</p>

  <p>'This is the model which is destined to be famous, as altering the balance
  of power among the nations. Who holds this rules the world. Now, Professor
  Challenger, you have, if I may say so, treated me with some lack of courtesy
  and consideration in this matter. Will you dare to sit upon that chair and to
  allow me to demonstrate upon your own body the capabilities of the new
  force?'</p>

  <p>Challenger had the courage of a lion, and anything in the nature of a
  defiance roused him in an instant to a frenzy He rushed at the machine, but I
  seized his arm and held him back.</p>

  <p>'You shall not go,' I said. 'Your life is too valuable. It is monstrous.
  What possible guarantee of safety have you? The nearest approach to that
  apparatus which I have ever seen was the electrocution chair at Sing
  Sing.'</p>

  <p>'My guarantee of safety,' said Challenger, 'is that you are a witness and
  that this person would certainly be held for manslaughter at the least should
  anything befall me.'</p>

  <p>'That would be a poor consolation to the world of science, when you would
  leave work unfinished which none but you can do. Let me, at least, go first,
  and then, when the experience proves to be harmless, you can follow.'</p>

  <p>Personal danger would never have moved Challenger, but the idea that his
  scientific work might remain unfinished hit him hard. He hesitated, and
  before he could make up his mind I had dashed forward and jumped into the
  chair. I saw the inventor put his hand to the handle. I was aware of a click.
  Then for a moment there was a sensation of confusion and a mist before my
  eyes. When they cleared, the inventor with his odious smile was standing
  before me, and Challenger, with his apple-red cheeks drained of blood and
  colour, was staring over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>'Well, get on with it!' said I.</p>

  <p>'It is all over. You responded admirably,' Nemor replied. 'Step out, and
  Professor Challenger will now, no doubt, be ready to take his turn.'</p>

  <p>I have never seen my old friend so utterly upset. His iron nerve had for a
  moment completely failed him. He grasped my arm with a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>'My God, Malone, it is true,' said he. 'You vanished. There is not a doubt
  of it. There was a mist for an instant and then vacancy.'</p>

  <p>'How long was I away?'</p>

  <p>'Two or three minutes. I was, I confess, horrified. I could not imagine
  that you would return. Then he clicked this lever, if it is a lever, into a
  new slot and there you were upon the chair, looking a little bewildered but
  otherwise the same as ever. I thanked God at the sight of you!' He mopped his
  moist brow with his big red handkerchief.</p>

  <p>'Now, sir,' said the inventor. 'Or perhaps your nerve has failed you?'</p>

  <p>Challenger visibly braced himself. Then, pushing my protesting hand to one
  side, he seated himself upon the chair. The handle clicked into number three.
  He was gone.</p>

  <p>I should have been horrified but for the perfect coolness of the operator.
  'It is an interesting process, is it not?' he remarked. 'When one considers
  the tremendous individuality of the Professor it is strange to think that he
  is at present a molecular cloud suspended in some portion of this building.
  He is now, of course, entirely at my mercy. If I choose to leave him in
  suspension there is nothing on earth to prevent me.'</p>

  <p>'I would very soon find means to prevent you.'</p>

  <p>The smile once again became a snarl. 'You cannot imagine that such a
  thought ever entered my mind. Good heavens! Think of the permanent
  dissolution of the great Professor Challenger vanished into cosmic space and
  left no trace! Terrible! Terrible! At the same time he has not been as
  courteous as he might. Don't you think some small lesson &mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'No, I do not.'</p>

  <p>'Well, we will call it a curious demonstration. Something that would make
  an interesting paragraph in your paper. For example, I have discovered that
  the hair of the body being on an entirely different vibration to the living
  organic tissues can be included or excluded at will. It would interest me to
  see the bear without his bristles. Behold him!'</p>

  <p>There was the click of the lever. An instant later Challenger was seated
  upon the chair once more. But what a Challenger! What a shorn lion! Furious
  as I was at the trick that had been played upon him I could hardly keep from
  roaring with laughter.</p>

  <p>His huge head was as bald as a baby's and his chin was as smooth as a
  girl's. Bereft of his glorious mane the lower part of his face was heavily
  jowled and ham-shaped, while his whole appearance was that of an old fighting
  gladiator, battered and bulging, with the jaws of a bulldog over a massive
  chin.</p>

  <p>It may have been some look upon our faces &mdash;I have no doubt that the
  evil grin of my companion had widened at the sight &mdash;but, however that
  may be, Challenger's hand flew up to his head and he became conscious of his
  condition. The next instant he had sprung out of his chair, seized the
  inventor by the throat, and had hurled him to the ground. Knowing
  Challenger's immense strength I was convinced that the man would be
  killed.</p>

  <p>'For God's sake be careful. If you kill him we can never get matters right
  again!' I cried.</p>

  <p>That argument prevailed. Even in his maddest moments Challenger was always
  open to reason. He sprang up from the floor, dragging the trembling inventor
  with him. 'I give you five minutes,' he panted in his fury. 'If in five
  minutes I am not as I was, I will choke the life out of your wretched little
  body.'</p>

  <p>Challenger in a fury was not a safe person to argue with. The bravest man
  might shrink from him, and there were no signs that Mr. Nemor was a
  particularly brave man. On the contrary, those blotches and warts upon his
  face had suddenly become much more conspicuous as the face behind them
  changed from the colour of putty, which was normal, to that of a fish's
  belly. His limbs were shaking and he could hardly articulate.</p>

  <p>'Really, Professor!' he babbled, with his hand to his throat, 'this
  violence is quite unnecessary. Surely a harmless joke may pass among friends.
  It was my wish to demonstrate the powers of the machine. I had imagined that
  you wanted a full demonstration. No offence, I assure you. Professor, none in
  the world!'</p>

  <p>For answer Challenger climbed back into the chair.</p>

  <p>'You will keep your eye upon him, Malone. Do not permit any
  liberties.'</p>

  <p>'I'll see to it, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Now then, set that matter right or take the consequences.'</p>

  <p>The terrified inventor approached his machine. The reuniting power was
  turned on to the full, and in an instant, there was the old lion with his
  tangled mane once more. He stroked his beard affectionately with his hands
  and passed them over his cranium to be sure that the restoration was
  complete. Then he descended solemnly from his perch.</p>

  <p>'You have taken a liberty, sir, which might have had very serious
  consequences to yourself. However, I am content to accept your explanation
  that you only did it for purposes of demonstration. Now, may I ask you a few
  direct questions upon this remarkable power which you claim to have
  discovered?'</p>

  <p>'I am ready to answer anything save what the source of the power is. That
  is my secret.'</p>

  <p>'And do you seriously inform us that no one in the world knows this except
  yourself?'</p>

  <p>'No one has the least inkling.'</p>

  <p>'No assistants?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir. I work alone.'</p>

  <p>'Dear me! That is most interesting. You have satisfied me as to the
  reality of the power, but I do not yet perceive its practical bearings.'</p>

  <p>'I have explained, sir, that this is a model. But it would be quite easy
  to erect a plant upon a large scale. You understand that this acts
  vertically. Certain currents above you, and certain others below you, set up
  vibrations which either disintegrate or reunite. But the process could be
  lateral. If it were so conducted it would have the same effect, and cover a
  space in proportion to the strength of the current.'</p>

  <p>'Give an example.'</p>

  <p>'We will suppose that one pole was in one small vessel and one in another;
  a battleship between them would simply vanish into molecules. So also with a
  column of troops.'</p>

  <p>'And you have sold this secret as a monopoly to a single European
  Power?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir, I have. When the money is paid over they shall have such power
  as no nation ever had yet. You don't even now see the full possibilities if
  placed in capable hands hands which did not fear to wield the weapon which
  they held. They are immeasurable.' A gloating smile passed over the man's
  evil face. 'Conceive a quarter of London in which such machines have been
  erected. Imagine the effect of such a current upon the scale which could
  easily be adopted. Why,' he burst into laughter, 'I could imagine the whole
  Thames valley being swept clean, and not one man, woman, or child left of all
  these teeming millions!'</p>

  <p>The words filled me with horror &mdash;and even more the air of exultation
  with which they were pronounced. They seemed, however, to produce quite a
  different effect upon my companion. To my surprise he broke into a genial
  smile and held out his hand to the inventor.</p>

  <p>'Well, Mr. Nemor, we have to congratulate you,' said he. 'There is no
  doubt that you have come upon a remarkable property of nature which you have
  succeeded in harnessing for the use of man. That this use should be
  destructive is no doubt very deplorable, but Science knows no distinctions of
  the sort, but follows knowledge wherever it may lead. Apart from the
  principle involved you have, I suppose, no objection to my examining the
  construction of the machine?'</p>

  <p>'None in the least. The machine is merely the body. It is the soul of it,
  the animating principle, which you can never hope to capture.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. But the mere mechanism seems to be a model of ingenuity.' For
  some time he walked round it and fingered its several parts. Then he hoisted
  his unwieldy bulk into the insulated chair.</p>

  <p>'Would you like another excursion into the cosmos?' asked the
  inventor.</p>

  <p>'Later, perhaps &mdash;later! But meanwhile there is, as no doubt you
  know, some leakage of electricity. I can distinctly feel a weak current
  passing through me.'</p>

  <p>'Impossible. It is quite insulated.'</p>

  <p>'But I assure you that I feel it.' He levered himself down from his
  perch.</p>

  <p>The inventor hastened to take his place.</p>

  <p>'I can feel nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Is there not a tingling down your spine?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir, I do not observe it.'</p>

  <p>There was a sharp click and the man had disappeared. I looked with
  amazement at Challenger. 'Good heavens! Did you touch the machine,
  Professor?'</p>

  <p>He smiled at me benignly with an air of mild surprise.</p>

  <p>'Dear me! I may have inadvertently touched the handle,' said he. 'One is
  very liable to have awkward incidents with a rough model of this kind. This
  lever should certainly be guarded.'</p>

  <p>'It is in number three. That is the slot which causes disintegration.'</p>

  <p>'So I observed when you were operated upon.'</p>

  <p>'But I was so excited when he brought you back that I did not see which
  was the proper slot for the return. Did you notice it?'</p>

  <p>'I may have noticed it, young Malone, but I do not burden my mind with
  small details. There are many slots and we do not know their purpose. We may
  make the matter worse if we experiment with the unknown. Perhaps it is better
  to leave matters as they are.'</p>

  <p>'And you would &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. It is better so. The interesting personality of Mr. Theodore
  Nemor has distributed itself throughout the cosmos, his machine is worthless,
  and a certain foreign Government has been deprived of knowledge by which much
  harm might have been wrought. Not a bad morning's work, young Malone. Your
  rag will no doubt have an interesting column upon the inexplicable
  disappearance of a Latvian inventor shortly after the visit of its own
  special correspondent. I have enjoyed the experience. These are the lighter
  moments which come to brighten the dull routine of study. But life has its
  duties as well as its pleasures, and I now return to the Italian Mazotti and
  his preposterous views upon the larval development of the tropical
  termites.'</p>

  <p>Looking back, it seemed to me that a slight oleaginous mist was still
  hovering round the chair. 'But surely &mdash;' I urged.</p>

  <p>'The first duty of the law-abiding citizen is to prevent murder,' said
  Professor Challenger. 'I have done so. Enough, Malone, enough! The theme will
  not bear discussion. It has already disengaged my thoughts too long from
  matters of more importance.'</p>
