<p class="first">OF course nine out of every ten intelligent
persons will refuse to believe that there could be a grain of
truth in the story I am now going to tell you. The tenth may have
some small faith in my veracity, but what I think of his
intelligence I am going to keep to myself.</p>

<p>In a certain portion of a certain Australian Colony two
miners, when out prospecting in what was then, as now, one of the
dreariest parts of the Island Continent, chanced upon a rich
find.</p>

<p>They applied to Government for the usual reward, and in less
than a month three thousand people were settled on the Field.
What privations they had to go through to get there, and the
miseries they had to endure when they did reach their journey's
end, have only a remote bearing on this story, but they would
make a big book.</p>

<p>I should explain that between Railhead and the Field was a
stretch of country some three hundred miles in extent. It was
badly watered, vilely grassed, and execrably timbered. What was
even worse, a considerable portion of it was made up of red sand,
and everybody who has been compelled to travel over that knows
what it means. Yet these enthusiastic seekers after wealth pushed
on, some on horseback, some in bullock-waggons, but the majority
travelled on foot; the graves, and the skeletons of cattle
belonging to those who had preceded them punctuating the route,
and telling them what they might expect as they advanced.</p>

<p>That the Field did not prove a success is now a matter of
history, but that same history, if you read between the lines,
gives one some notion of what the life must have been like while
it lasted. The water supply was entirely insufficient, provisions
were bad and ruinously expensive; the men themselves were, as a
rule, the roughest of the rough, while the less said about the
majority of the women the better. Then typhoid stepped in and
stalked like the Destroying Angel through the camp. Its
inhabitants went down like sheep in a drought, and for the most
part rose no more. Where there had been a lust of gold there was
now panic, terror&mdash;every man feared that he might be the
next to be attacked, and it was only the knowledge of those
terrible three hundred miles that separated them from
civilisation that kept many of them on the Field. The most
thickly populated part was now the cemetery. Drink was the only
solace, and under its influence such scenes were enacted as I
dare not describe. As they heard of fresh deaths, men shook their
fists at Heaven, and cursed the day when they first saw pick or
shovel. Some, bolder than the rest, cleared out just as they
stood; a few eventually reached civilisation, others perished in
the desert. At last the Field was declared abandoned, and the
dead were left to take their last long sleep, undisturbed by the
clank of windlass or the blow of pick.</p>

<p><br>
IT would take too long to tell all the different reasons that
combined to draw me out into that 'most distressful country'. Let
it suffice that our party consisted of a young Englishman named
Spicer, a wily old Australian bushman named Matthews, and myself.
We were better off than the unfortunate miners, inasmuch as we
were travelling with camels, and our outfits were as perfect as
money and experience could make them. The man who travels in any
other fashion in that country is neither more nor less than a
madman. For a month past we had been having a fairly rough time
of it, and were then on our way south, where we had reason to
believe rain had fallen, and, in consequence, grass was
plentiful. It was towards evening when we came out of a gully in
the ranges and had our first view of the deserted camp. We had no
idea of its existence, and for this reason we pulled up our
animals and stared at it in complete surprise. Then we pushed on
again, wondering what on earth place we had chanced upon.</p>

<p>'This is all right,' said Spicer, with a chuckle. 'We're in
luck. Grog shanties and stores, a bath, and perhaps girls.'</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>'I can't make it out,' I said. 'What's it doing out here?'</p>

<p>Matthews was looking at it under his hand, and, as I knew that
he had been out in this direction on a previous occasion, I asked
his opinion.</p>

<p>'It beats me,' he replied; 'but if you ask me what I think I
should say it's Gurunya, the Field that was deserted some four or
five years back.'</p>

<p>'Look here,' cried Spicer, who was riding a bit on our left,
'what are all these things&mdash;graves, as I'm a living man.
Here, let's get out of this. There are hundreds of them and
before I know where I am old Polyphemus here will be on his
nose.'</p>

<p>What he said was correct&mdash;the ground over which we were
riding was literally bestrewn with graves, some of which had
rough, tumbledown head boards, others being destitute of all
adornment. We turned away and moved on over safer ground in the
direction of the Field itself.</p>

<p>Such a pitiful sight I never want to see again. The tents and
huts, in numerous cases, were still standing, while the claims
gaped at us on every side like new-made graves. A bullock dray,
weather-worn but still in excellent condition, stood in the main
street outside a grog shanty whose sign-board, strange
incongruity, bore the name of 'The Killarney Hotel'. Nothing
would suit Spicer but that he must dismount and go in to explore.
He was not long away, and when he returned it was with a face as
white as a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>'You never saw such a place,' he almost whispered. 'All I want
to do is to get out of it. There's a skeleton on the floor in the
back room with an empty rum bottle alongside it.'</p>

<p>He mounted, and, when his beast was on its feet once more, we
went on our way. Not one of us was sorry when we had left the
last claim behind us.</p>

<p><br>
HALF a mile or so from the Field the country begins to rise
again. There is also a curious cliff away to the left, and, as it
looked like being a likely place to find water, we resolved to
camp there. We were within a hundred yards or so of this cliff
when an exclamation from Spicer attracted my attention.</p>

<p>'Look!' he cried. 'What's that?'</p>

<p>I followed the direction in which he was pointing, and, to my
surprise, saw the figure of a man running as if for his life
among the rocks. I have said the figure of a man, but, as a
matter of fact, had there been baboons in the Australian bush, I
should have been inclined to have taken him for one.</p>

<p>'This is a day of surprises,' I said. 'Who can the fellow be?
And what makes him act like that?'</p>

<p>We still continued to watch him as he proceeded on his erratic
course along the base of the cliff&mdash;then he suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<p>'Let's get on to camp,' I said, 'and then we'll go after him
and endeavour to settle matters a bit.'</p>

<p>Having selected a place we offsaddled and prepared our camp.
By this time it was nearly dark, and it was very evident that, if
we wanted to discover the man we had seen, it would be wise not
to postpone the search too long. We accordingly strolled off in
the direction he had taken, keeping a sharp look-out for any sign
of him. Our search, however, was not successful. The fellow had
disappeared without leaving a trace of his whereabouts behind
him, and yet we were all certain that we had seen him. At length
we returned to our camp for supper, completely mystified. As we
ate our meal we discussed the problem and vowed that, on the
morrow, we would renew the search. Then the full moon rose over
the cliff, and the plain immediately became well-nigh as bright
as day. I had lit my pipe and was stretching myself out upon my
blankets when something induced me to look across at a big rock,
some half-dozen paces from the fire. Peering round it, and
evidently taking an absorbing interest in our doings, was the
most extraordinary figure I have ever beheld. Shouting something
to my companions, I sprang to my feet and dashed across at him.
He saw me and fled. Old as he apparently was, he could run like a
jack-rabbit, and, though I have the reputation of being fairly
quick on my feet, I found that I had all my work cut out to catch
him. Indeed, I am rather doubtful as to whether I should have
done so at all had he not tripped and measured his length on the
ground. Before he could get up I was on him.</p>

<p>'I've got you at last, my friend,' I said. 'Now you just come
along back to the camp, and let us have a look at you.'</p>

<p>In reply he snarled like a dog and I believe would have bitten
me had I not held him off. My word, he was a creature, more
animal than man, and the reek of him was worse than that of our
camels. From what I could tell he must have been about sixty
years of age&mdash;was below the middle height, had white
eyebrows, white hair and a white beard. He was dressed partly in
rags and partly in skins, and went barefooted like a black
fellow. While I was overhauling him the others came
up&mdash;whereupon we escorted him back to the camp.</p>

<p>'What wouldn't Barnum give for him?' said Spicer. 'You're a
beauty, my friend, and no mistake. What's your name?'</p>

<p>The fellow only grunted in reply&mdash;then, seeing the pipes
in our mouths, a curious change came over him, and he muttered
something that resembled 'Give me.'</p>

<p>'Wants a smoke,' interrupted Matthew's. 'Poor beggar's been
without for a long time, I reckon. Well, I've got an old pipe, so
he can have a draw.'</p>

<p>He procured one from his pack saddle, filled it and handed it
to the man, who snatched it greedily and began to puff away at
it.</p>

<p>'How long have you been out here?' I asked, when he had
squatted himself down alongside the fire.</p>

<p>'Don't know,' he answered, this time plainly enough.</p>

<p>'Can't you get back?' continued Matthews, who knew the nature
of the country on the other side.</p>

<p>'Don't want to,' was the other's laconic reply. 'Stay
here.'</p>

<p>I heard Spicer mutter, 'Mad&mdash;mad as a March hare.'</p>

<p>We then tried to get out of him where he hailed from, but he
had either forgotten or did not understand. Next we inquired how
he managed to live. To this he answered readily enough,
'Carnies.'</p>

<p>Now the carny is a lizard of the iguana type, and eaten raw
would be by no means an appetizing dish. Then came the question
that gives me my reason for telling this story. It was Spicer who
put it.</p>

<p>'You must have a lonely time of it out here,' said the latter.
'How do you manage for company?'</p>

<p>'There is the Field,' he said, 'as sociable a Field as you'd
find.'</p>

<p>'But the Field's deserted, man,' I put in. 'And has been for
years.'</p>

<p>The old fellow shook his head.</p>

<p>'As sociable a Field as ever you saw,' he repeated. 'There's
Sailor Dick and 'Frisco, Dick Johnson, Cockney Jim, and half a
hundred of them. They're taking it out powerful rich on the
Golden South, so I heard when I was down at "The Killarney", a
while back.'</p>

<p><br>
IT was plain to us all that the old man was, as Spicer had
said, as mad as a hatter. For some minutes he rambled on about
the Field, talking rationally enough, I must confess that is to
say, it would have seemed rational enough if we hadn't known the
true facts of the case. At last he got on to his feet, saving.
'Well, I must be going&mdash;they'll be expecting me. It's my
shift on with Cockney Jim.'</p>

<p>'But you don't work at night,' growled Matthews, from the
other side of the fire.</p>

<p>'We work always,' the other replied. 'If you don't believe me,
come and see for yourselves.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't go back to that place for anything,' said
Spicer.</p>

<p>But I must confess that my curiosity had been aroused, and I
determined to go, if only to see what this strange creature did
when he got there. Matthews decided to accompany me, and, not
wishing to be left alone, Spicer at length agreed to do the same.
Without looking round, the old fellow led the way across the
plain towards the Field. Of all the nocturnal excursions I have
made in my life, that was certainly the most uncanny. Not once
did our guide turn his head, but pushed on at a pace that gave us
some trouble to keep up with him. It was only when we came to the
first claim that he paused.</p>

<p>'Listen,' he said, 'and you can hear the camp at work. Then
you'll believe me.'</p>

<p>We did listen, and as I live we could distinctly hear the
rattling of sluice-boxes and cradles, the groaning of
windlasses&mdash;in fact, the noise you hear on a goldfield at
the busiest hour of the day.</p>

<p>We moved a little closer, and, believe me or not, I swear to
you I could see, or thought I could see, the shadowy forms of men
moving about in that ghostly moonlight. Meanwhile the wind sighed
across the plain, flapping what remained of the old tents and
giving an additional touch of horror to the general desolation. I
could hear Spicer's teeth chattering behind me, and, for my own
part, I felt as if my blood were turning to ice.</p>

<p>'That's the claim, the Golden South, away to the right there,'
said the old man, 'and if you will come along with me, I'll
introduce you to my mates.'</p>

<p>But this was an honour we declined, and without hesitation. I
wouldn't have gone any further among those tents for the wealth
of all the Indies.</p>

<p>'I've had enough of this,' said Spicer, and I can tell you I
hardly recognised his voice. 'Let's get back to camp.'</p>

<p><br>
BY this time our guide had left us, and was making his way in
the direction he had indicated.</p>

<p>We could plainly hear him addressing imaginary people as he
marched along. As for ourselves, we turned about and hurried back
to our camp as fast as we could go.</p>

<p>Once there, the grog bottle was produced, and never did three
men stand more in need of stimulants. Then we set to work to find
some explanation of what we had seen, or had fancied we saw. But
it was impossible. The wind might have rattled the old
windlasses, but it could not be held accountable for those
shadowy grey forms that had moved about among the claims.</p>

<p>'I give it up,' said Spicer, at last. 'I know that I never
want to see it again. What's more, I vote that we clear out of
here to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>We all agreed, and then retired to our blankets, but for my
part I do not mind confessing I scarcely slept a wink all night.
The thought that that hideous old man might be hanging about the
camp would alone be sufficient for that.</p>

<p><br>
NEXT morning, as soon as it was light, we breakfasted, but,
before we broke camp, Matthews and I set off along the cliff in
an attempt to discover our acquaintance of the previous
evening.</p>

<p>Though, however, we searched high and low for upwards of an
hour, no success rewarded us. By mutual consent we resolved not
to look for him on the Field. When we returned to Spicer we
placed such tobacco and stores as we could spare under the shadow
of the big rock, where the Mystery Man would be likely to see
them, then mounted our camels and resumed our journey, heartily
glad to be on our way once more.</p>

<p>Gurunya Goldfield is a place I never desire to visit again. I
don't like its population.</p>
