<p style="text-indent:0">STEVE BRILL did not believe in ghosts or
demons. Juan Lopez did. But neither the caution of the one nor the
sturdy skepticism of the other was shield against the horror that
fell upon them&mdash;the horror forgotten by men for more than
three hundred years&mdash;a screaming fear monstrously resurrected
from the black lost ages.</p>

<p>Yet as Steve Brill sat on his sagging stoop that last evening,
his thoughts were as far from uncanny menaces as the thoughts of
man can be. His ruminations were bitter but materialistic. He
surveyed his farmland and he swore. Brill was tall, rangy and tough
as boot-leather&mdash;true son of the iron-bodied pioneers who
wrenched West Texas from the wilderness. He was browned by the sun
and strong as a longhorned steer. His lean legs and the boots on
them showed his cowboy instincts, and now he cursed himself that he
had ever climbed off the hurricane deck of his crankeyed mustang
and turned to farming. He was no farmer, the young puncher admitted
profanely.</p>

<p>Yet his failure had not all been his fault. Plentiful rain in
the winter&mdash;so rare in West Texas&mdash;had given promise of
good crops. But as usual, things had happened. A late blizzard had
destroyed all the budding fruit. The grain which had looked so
promising was ripped to shreds and battered into the ground by
terrific hailstorms just as it was turning yellow. A period of
intense dryness, followed by another hailstorm, finished the
corn.</p>

<p>Then the cotton, which had somehow struggled through, fell
before a swarm of grasshoppers which stripped Brill's field almost
overnight. So Brill sat and swore that he would not renew his
lease&mdash;he gave fervent thanks that he did not own the land on
which he had wasted his sweat, and that there were still broad
rolling ranges to the West where a strong young man could make his
living riding and roping.</p>

<p>Now as Brill sat glumly, he was aware of the approaching form of
his nearest neighbor, Juan Lopez, a taciturn old Mexican who lived
in a hut just out of sight over the hill across the creek, and
grubbed for a living. At present he was clearing a strip of land on
an adjoining farm, and in returning to his hut he crossed a corner
of Brill's pasture.</p>

<p>Brill idly watched him climb through the barbed-wire fence and
trudge along the path he had worn in the short dry grass. He had
been working at his present job for over a month now, chopping down
tough gnarly mesquite trees and digging up their incredibly long
roots, and Brill knew that he always followed the same path home.
And watching, Brill noted him swerving far aside, seemingly to
avoid a low rounded hillock which jutted above the level of the
pasture. Lopez went far around this knoll and Brill remembered that
the old Mexican always circled it at a distance. And another thing
came into Brill's idle mind&mdash;Lopez always increased his gait
when he was passing the knoll, and he always managed to get by it
before sundown&mdash;yet Mexican laborers generally worked from the
first light of dawn to the last glint of twilight, especially at
these grubbing jobs, when they were paid by the acre and not by the
day. Brill's curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p>He rose, and sauntering down the slight slope on the crown of
which his shack sat, hailed the plodding Mexican.</p>

<p>"Hey, Lopez, wait a minute."</p>

<p>Lopez halted; looked about, and remained motionless but
unenthusiastic as the white man approached.</p>

<p>"Lopez," said Brill lazily, "it ain't none of my business, but I
just wanted to ask you&mdash;how come you always go so far around
that old Indian mound?"</p>

<p>"No <i>sabe</i>," grunted Lopez shortly.</p>

<p>"You're a liar," responded Brill genially. "You savvy all right;
you speak English as good as me. What's the matter&mdash;you think
that mound's ha'nted or somethin'!"</p>

<p>Brill could speak Spanish himself and read it, too, but like
most Anglo-Saxons he much preferred to speak his own language.</p>

<p>Lopez shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is not a good place, <i>no bueno</i>," he muttered, avoiding
Brill's eyes. "Let hidden things rest."</p>

<p>"I reckon you're scared of ghosts," Brill bantered. "Shucks, if
that is an Indian mound, them Indians been dead so long their
ghosts 'ud be plumb wore out by now."</p>

<p>Brill knew that the illiterate Mexicans looked with
superstitious aversion on the mounds that are found here and there
through the Southwest&mdash;relics of a past and forgotten age,
containing the moldering bones of chiefs and warriors of a lost
race.</p>

<p>"Best not to disturb what is hidden in the earth," grunted
Lopez.</p>

<p>"Bosh," said Brill. "Me and some boys busted into one of them
mounds over in the Palo Pinto country and dug up pieces of a
skeleton with some beads and flint arrowheads and the like. I kept
some of the teeth a long time till I lost 'em, and I ain't never
been ha'nted."</p>

<p>"Indians?" snorted Lopez unexpectedly. "Who spoke of Indians?
There have been more than Indians in this country. In the old times
strange things happened here. I have heard the tales of my people,
handed down from generation to generation. And my people were here
long before yours, Señor Brill."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right," admitted Steve. "First white men in this
country was Spaniards, of course. Coronado passed along not very
far from here, I hear tell, and Hernando de Estrada's expedition
came through here&mdash;away back yonder&mdash;I dunno how long
ago."</p>

<p>"In 1545," said Lopez. "They pitched camp yonder where your
corral stands now."</p>

<p>Brill turned to glance at his rail-fenced corral, inhabited now
by his saddle-horse, a pair of workhorses and a scrawny cow.</p>

<p>"How come you know so much about it?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"One of my ancestors marched with de Estrada," answered Lopez.
"A soldier, Porfirio Lopez; he told his son of that expedition, and
he told his son, and so down the family line to me, who have no son
to whom I can tell the tale."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were so well connected," said Brill. "Maybe
you know somethin' about the gold de Estrada was supposed to have
hid around here, somewhere."</p>

<p>"There was no gold," growled Lopez. "De Estrada's soldiers bore
only their arms, and they fought their way through hostile
country&mdash;many left their bones along the trail.
Later&mdash;many years later&mdash;a mule train from Santa Fe was
attacked not many miles from here by Comanches and they hid their
gold and escaped; so the legends got mixed up. But even their gold
is not there now, because Gringo buffalo-hunters found it and dug
it up."</p>

<p>Brill nodded abstractedly, hardly heeding. Of all the continent
of North America there is no section so haunted by tales of lost or
hidden treasure as is the Southwest. Uncounted wealth passed back
and forth over the hills and plains of Texas and New Mexico in the
old days when Spain owned the gold and silver mines of the New
World and controlled the rich fur trade of the West, and echoes of
that wealth linger on in tales of golden caches. Some such vagrant
dream, born of failure and pressing poverty, rose in Brill's
mind.</p>

<p>Aloud he spoke: "Well, anyway, I got nothin' else to do and I
believe I'll dig into that old mound and see what I can find."</p>

<p>The effect of that simple statement on Lopez was nothing short
of shocking. He recoiled and his swarthy brown face went ashy; his
black eyes flared and he threw up his arms in a gesture of intense
expostulation.</p>

<p>"<i>Dios, no!</i>" he cried. "Don't do that, Señor Brill! There
is a curse&mdash;my grandfather told me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Told you what?" asked Brill.</p>

<p>Lopez lapsed into sullen silence.</p>

<p>"I cannot speak," he muttered. "I am sworn to silence. Only to
an eldest son could I open my heart. But believe me when I say
better had you cut your throat than to break into that accursed
mound."</p>

<p>"Well," said Brill, impatient of Mexican superstitions, "if it's
so bad why don't you tell me about it? Gimme a logical reason for
not bustin' into it."</p>

<p>"I cannot speak!" cried the Mexican desperately. "I
know!&mdash;but I swore to silence on the Holy Crucifix, just as
every man of my family has sworn. It is a thing so dark, it is to
risk damnation even to speak of it! Were I to tell you, I would
blast the soul from your body. But I have sworn&mdash;and I have no
son, so my lips are sealed forever."</p>

<p>"Aw, well," said Brill sarcastically, "why don't you write it
out?"</p>

<p>Lopez started, stared, and to Steve's surprise, caught at the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"I will! <i>Dios</i> be thanked the good priest taught me to
write when I was a child. My oath said nothing of writing. I only
swore not to speak. I will write out the whole thing for you, if
you will swear not to speak of it afterward, and to destroy the
paper as soon as you have read it.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Brill, to humor him, and the old Mexican seemed
much relieved.</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno</i>! I will go at once and write. Tomorrow as I go to
work I will bring you the paper and you will understand why no one
must open that accursed mound!"</p>

<p>And Lopez hurried along his homeward path, his stooped shoulders
swaying with the effort of his unwonted haste. Steve grinned after
him, shrugged his shoulders and turned back toward his own shack.
Then he halted, gazing back at the low rounded mound with its
grass-grown sides. It must be an Indian tomb, he decided, what with
its symmetry and its similarity to other Indian mounds he had seen.
He scowled as he tried to figure out the seeming connection between
the mysterious knoll and the martial ancestor of Juan Lopez.</p>

<p>Brill gazed after the receding figure of the old Mexican. A
shallow valley, cut by a half-dry creek, bordered with trees and
underbrush, lay between Brill's pasture and the low sloping hill
beyond which lay Lopez's shack. Among the trees along the creek
bank the old Mexican was disappearing. And Brill came to a sudden
decision.</p>

<p>Hurrying up the slight slope, he took a pick and a shovel from
the tool shed built onto the back of his shack. The sun had not yet
set and Brill believed he could open the mound deep enough to
determine its nature before dark. If not, he could work by lantern
light. Steve, like most of his breed, lived mostly by impulse, and
his present urge was to tear into that mysterious hillock and find
what, if anything, was concealed therein. The thought of treasure
came again to his mind, piqued by the evasive attitude of
Lopez.</p>

<p>What if, after all, that grassy heap of brown earth hid
riches&mdash;virgin ore from forgotten mines, or the minted coinage
of old Spain? Was it not possible that the musketeers of de Estrada
had themselves reared that pile above a treasure they could not
bear away, molding it in the likeness of an Indian mound to fool
seekers? Did old Lopez know that? It would not be strange if,
knowing of treasure there, the old Mexican refrained from
disturbing it. Ridden with grisly superstitious fears, he might
well live out a life of barren toil rather than risk the wrath of
lurking ghosts or devils&mdash;for the Mexicans say that hidden
gold is always accursed, and surely there was supposed to be some
especial doom resting on this mound. Well, Brill meditated,
Latin-Indian devils had no terrors for the Anglo-Saxon, tormented
by the demons of drouth and storm and crop failure.</p>

<p>Steve set to work with the savage energy characteristic of his
breed. The task was no light one; the soil, baked by the fierce
sun, was iron-hard, and mixed with rocks and pebbles. Brill sweated
profusely and grunted with his efforts, but the fire of the
treasure-hunter was on him. He shook the sweat out of his eyes and
drove in the pick with mighty strokes that ripped and crumbled the
close-packed dirt.</p>

<p>The sun went down, and in the long dreamy summer twilight he
worked on, almost oblivious of time or space. He began to be
convinced that the mound was a genuine Indian tomb, as he found
traces of charcoal in the soil. The ancient people which reared
these sepulchers had kept fires burning upon them for days, at some
point in the building. All the mounds Steve had ever opened had
contained a solid stratum of charcoal a short distance below the
surface: But the charcoal traces he found now were scattered about
through the soil.</p>

<p>His idea of a Spanish-built treasure trove faded, but he
persisted. Who knows? Perhaps that strange folk men now called
Mound-Builders had treasure of their own which they laid away with
the dead.</p>

<p>Then Steve yelped in exultation as his pick rang on a bit of
metal. He snatched it up and held it close to his eyes, straining
in the waning, light. It was caked and corroded with rust, worn
almost paper-thin, but he knew it for what it was&mdash;a
spur-rowel, unmistakably Spanish with its long cruel points. And he
halted, completely bewildered. No Spaniard ever reared this mound,
with its undeniable marks of aboriginal workmanship. Yet how came
that relic of Spanish caballeros hidden deep in the packed
soil?</p>

<p>Brill shook his head and set to work again. He knew that in the
center of the mound, if it were indeed an aboriginal tomb, he would
find a narrow chamber built of heavy stones, containing the bones
of the chief for whom the mound had been reared and the victims
sacrificed above it. And in the gathering darkness he felt his pick
strike heavily against something granite-like and unyielding.
Examination, by sense of feel as well as by sight, proved it to be
a solid block of stone, roughly hewn. Doubtless it formed one of
the ends of the deathchamber. Useless to try to shatter it. Brill
chipped and pecked about it, scrapping the dirt and pebbles away
from the corners until he felt that wrenching it out would be but a
matter of sinking the pick-point underneath and levering it
out.</p>

<p>But now he was suddenly aware that darkness had come on. In the
young moon objects were dim and shadowy. His mustang nickered in
the corral whence came the comfortable crunch of tired beasts' jaws
on corn. A whippoorwill called eerily from the dark shadows of the
narrow winding creek. Brill straightened reluctantly. Better get a
lantern and continue his explorations by its light.</p>

<p>He felt in his pocket with some idea of wrenching out the stone
and exploring the cavity by the aid of matches. Then he stiffened.
Was it imagination that he heard a faint sinister rustling, which
seemed to come from behind the blocking stone? Snakes! Doubtless
they had holes somewhere about the base of the mound and there
might be a dozen big diamond-backed rattlers coiled up in that
cave-like interior waiting for him to put his hand among them. He
shivered slightly at the thought and backed away out of the
excavation he had made.</p>

<p>It wouldn't do to go poking about blindly into holes. And for
the past few minutes, he realized, he had been aware of a faint
foul odor exuding from interstices about the blocking
stone&mdash;though he admitted that the smell suggested reptiles no
more than it did any other menacing scent. It had a charnel-house
reek about it&mdash;gases formed in the chamber of death, no doubt,
and dangerous to the living.</p>

<p>Steve laid down his pick and returned to the house, impatient of
the necessary delay. Entering the dark building, he struck a match
and located his kerosene lantern hanging on its nail on the wall.
Shaking it, he satisfied himself that it was nearly full of coal
oil, and lighted it. Then he fared forth again, for his eagerness
would not allow him to pause long enough for a bite of food. The
mere opening of the mound intrigued him, as it must always intrigue
a man of imagination, and the discovery of the Spanish spur had
whetted his curiosity.</p>

<p>He hurried from his shack, the swinging lantern casting long
distorted shadows ahead of him and behind. He chuckled as he
visualized Lopez's thoughts and actions when he learned, on the
morrow, that the forbidden mound had been pried into. A good thing
he opened it that evening, Brill reflected; Lopez might even have
tried to prevent him meddling with it, had he known.</p>

<p>In the dreamy hush of the summer night, Brill reached the
mound&mdash;lifted his lantern&mdash;swore bewilderedly. The
lantern revealed his excavations, his tools lying carelessly where
he had dropped them&mdash;and a black gaping aperture! The great
blocking stone lay in the bottom of the excavation he had made, as
if thrust carelessly aside. Warily he thrust the lantern forward
and peered into the small cave-like chamber, expecting to see he
knew not what. Nothing met his eyes except the bare rock sides of a
long narrow cell, large enough to receive a man's body, which had
apparently been built up of roughly hewn square-cut stones,
cunningly and strongly joined together.</p>

<p>"Lopez!" exclaimed Steve furiously. "The dirty coyote! He's been
watchin' me work&mdash;and when I went after the lantern, he snuck
up and pried the rock out and grabbed whatever was in there, I
reckon. Blast his greasy hide, I'll fix him!"</p>

<p>Savagely he extinguished the lantern and glared across the
shallow, brush-grown valley. And as he looked he stiffened. Over
the corner of the hill, on the other side of which the shack of
Lopez stood, a shadow moved. The slender moon was setting, the
light dim and the play of the shadows baffling. But Steve's eyes
were sharpened by the sun and winds of the wastelands, and he knew
that it was some two-legged creature that was disappearing over the
low shoulder of the mesquite-grown hill.</p>

<p>"Beatin' it to his shack," snarled Brill. "He's shore got
somethin' or he wouldn't be travelin' at that speed."</p>

<p>Brill swallowed, wondering why a peculiar trembling had suddenly
taken hold of him. What was there unusual about a thieving old
greaser running home with his loot? Brill tried to drown the
feeling that there was something peculiar about the gait of the dim
shadow, which had seemed to move at a sort of slinking lope. There,
must have been need for swiftness when stocky old Juan Lopez
elected to travel at such a strange pace.</p>

<p>"Whatever he found is as much mine as his," swore Brill, trying
to get his mind off the abnormal aspect of the figure's flight, "I
got this land leased and I done all the work diggin'. A curse,
heck! No wonder he told me that stuff. Wanted me to leave it alone
so he could get it hisself. It's a wonder he ain't dug it up long
before this. But you can't never tell about them spigs."</p>

<p>Brill, as he meditated thus, was striding down the gentle slope
of the pasture which led down to the creek bed. He passed into the
shadows of the trees and dense underbrush and walked across the dry
creek bed, noting absently that neither whippoorwill nor hoot-owl
called in the darkness. There was a waiting, listening tenseness in
the night that he did not like. The shadows in the creek bed seemed
too thick, too breathless. He wished he had not blown out the
lantern, which he still carried, and was glad he had brought the
pick, gripped like a battle-ax in his right hand. He had an impulse
to whistle, just to break the silence, then swore and dismissed the
thought. Yet he was glad when he clambered up the low opposite bank
and emerged into the starlight.</p>

<p>He walked up the slope and onto the hill, and looked down on the
mesquite flat wherein stood Lopez's squalid hut. A light showed at
the one window.</p>

<p>"Packin' his things for a getaway, I reckon," grunted Steve.
"Ow, what the&mdash;"</p>

<p>He staggered as from a physical impact as a frightful scream
knifed the stillness. He wanted to clap his hands over his ears to
shut out the horror of that cry, which rose unbearably and then
broke in an abhorrent gurgle.</p>

<p>"Good God!" Steve felt the cold sweat spring out upon him.
"Lopez&mdash;or somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he gasped the words he was running down the hill as fast
as his long legs could carry him. Some unspeakable horror was
taking place in that lonely hut, but he was going to investigate if
it meant facing the Devil himself. He tightened his grip on his
pick-handle as he ran. Wandering prowlers, murdering old Lopez for
the loot he had taken from the mound, Steve thought, and forgot his
wrath. It would go hard for anyone he caught molesting the old
scoundrel, thief though he might be.</p>

<p>He hit the flat, running hard. And then the light in the hut
went out and Steve staggered in full flight, bringing up against a
mesquite tree with an impact that jolted a grunt out of him and
tore his hands on the thorns. Rebounding with a sobbed curse, he
rushed for the shack, nerving himself for what he might
see&mdash;his hair still standing on end at what he had already
seen.</p>

<p>Brill tried the one door of the hut and found it bolted. He
shouted to Lopez and received no answer. Yet utter silence did not
reign. From within came a curious muffled worrying sound that
ceased as Brill swung his pick crashing against the door. The
flimsy portal splintered and Brill leaped into the dark hut, eyes
blazing, pick swung high for a desperate onslaught. But no sound
ruffled the grisly silence, and in the darkness nothing stirred,
though Brill's chaotic imagination peopled the shadowed corners of
the hut with shapes of horror.</p>

<p>With a hand damp with perspiration he found a match and struck
it. Besides himself only Lopez occupied the hut&mdash;old Lopez,
stark dead on the dirt floor, arms spread wide like a crucifix,
mouth sagging open in a semblance of idiocy, eyes wide and staring
with a horror Brill found intolerable. The one window gaped open,
showing the method of the slayer's exit&mdash;possibly his entrance
as well. Brill went to that window and gazed out warily. He saw
only the sloping hillside on one hand and the mesquite flat on the
other. He starred&mdash;was that a hint of movement among the
stunted shadows of the mesquites and chaparral&mdash;or had he but
imagined he glimpsed a dim loping figure among the trees?</p>

<p>He turned back, as the match burned down to his fingers. He lit
the old coal-oil lamp on the rude table, cursing as he burned his
hand. The globe of the lamp was very hot, as if it had been burning
for hours.</p>

<p>Reluctantly he turned to the corpse on the floor. Whatever sort
of death had come to Lopez, it had been horrible, but Brill,
gingerly examining the dead man, found no wound&mdash;no mark of
knife or bludgeon on him. Wait. There was a thin smear of blood on
Brill's questing hand. Searching, he found the source&mdash;three
or four tiny punctures in Lopez's throat, from which blood had
oozed sluggishly. At first he thought they had been inflicted with
a stiletto&mdash;a thin round edgeless dagger then he shook his
head. He had seen stiletto wounds&mdash;he had the scar of one on
his own body. These wounds more resembled the bite of some
animal&mdash;they looked like the marks of pointed fangs.</p>

<p>Yet Brill did not believe they were deep enough to have caused
death, nor had much blood flowed from them. A belief, abhorrent
with grisly speculations, rose up in the dark corners of his
mind&mdash;that Lopez had died of fright and that the wounds had
been inflicted either simultaneously&mdash;with his death, or an
instant afterward.</p>

<p>And Steve noticed something else; scrawled about on the floor
lay a number of dingy leaves of paper, scrawled in the old
Mexican's crude hand&mdash;he would write of the curse of the
mound, he had said. There were the sheets on which he had written,
there was the stump of a pencil on the floor, there was the hot
lamp globe, all mute witnesses that the old Mexican had been seated
at the rough-hewn table writing for hours. Then it was not he who
opened the mound-chamber and stole the contents&mdash;but who was
it, in God's name? And who or what was it that Brill had glimpsed
loping over the shoulder of the hill?</p>

<p>Well, there was but one thing to do&mdash;saddle his mustang and
ride the ten miles to Coyote Wells, the nearest town, and inform
the sheriff of the murder.</p>

<p>Brill gathered up the papers. The last was crumpled in the old
man's clutching hand and Brill secured it with some difficulty.
Then as he turned to extinguish the light, he hesitated, and cursed
himself for the crawling fear that lurked at the back of his
mind&mdash;fear of the shadowy thing he had seen cross the window
just before the light was extinguished in the hut. The long arm of
the murderer, he thought, reaching for the lamp to put it out, no
doubt. What had there been abnormal or inhuman about that vision,
distorted though it must have been in the dim lamplight and shadow?
As a man strives to remember the details of a nightmare dream,
Steve tried to define in his mind some clear reason that would
explain, why that flying glimpse had unnerved him to the extent of
blundering headlong into a tree, and why the mere vague remembrance
of it now caused cold sweat to break out on him.</p>

<p>Cursing himself to keep up his courage, he lighted his lantern,
blew out the lamp on the rough table, and resolutely set forth,
grasping his pick like a weapon. After all, why should certain
seemingly abnormal aspects about a sordid murder upset him? Such
crimes were abhorrent, but common enough, especially among
Mexicans, who cherished unguessed feuds.</p>

<p>Then as he stepped into the silent star-flecked night he brought
up short. From across the creek sounded the sudden soul-shaking
scream of a horse in deadly terror&mdash;then a mad drumming of
hoofs that receded in the distance. And Brill swore in rage and
dismay. Was it a panther lurking in the hills&mdash;had a monster
cat slain old Lopez? Then why was not the victim marked with the
scars of fierce hooked talons? <i>And who extinguished the light in
the hut?</i></p>

<p>As he wondered, Brill was running swiftly toward the dark creek.
Not lightly does a cowpuncher regard the stampeding of his stock.
As he passed into the darkness of the brush along the dry creek,
Brill found his tongue strangely dry. He kept swallowing, and he
held the lantern high. It made but faint impression in the gloom,
but seemed to accentuate the blackness of the crowding shadows. For
some strange reason, the thought entered Brill's chaotic mind that
though the land was new to the Anglo-Saxon, it was in reality very
old. That broken and desecrated tomb was mute evidence that the
land was ancient to man, and suddenly the night and the hills and
the shadows bore on Brill with a sense of hideous antiquity. Here
had long, generations of men lived and died before Brill's
ancestors ever heard of the land. In the night, in the shadows of
this very creek, men had no doubt given up their ghosts in grisly
ways. With these reflections Brill hurried through the shadows of
the thick trees.</p>

<p>He breathed deeply in relief when he emerged from the trees on
his own side. Hurrying up the gentle slope to the railed corral, he
held up his lantern, investigating. The corral was empty; not even
the placid cow was in sight. And the bars were down. That pointed
to human agency, and the affair took on a newly sinister aspect.
Someone did not intend that Brill should ride to Coyote Wells that
night. It meant that the murderer intended making his getaway and
wanted a good start on the law, or else&mdash;Brill grinned wryly.
Far away across a mesquite flat he believed he could still catch
the faint and faraway noise of running horses. What in God's name
had given them such a fright? A cold finger of fear played
shudderingly on Brill's spine.</p>

<p>Steve headed for the house. He did not enter boldly. He crept
clear around the shack, peering shudderingly into the dark windows,
listening with painful intensity for some sound to betray the
presence of the lurking killer. At last he ventured to open the
door and step in. He threw the door back against the wall to find
if anyone were hiding behind it, lifted the lantern high and
stepped in, heart pounding, pick gripped fiercely, his feelings a
mixture of fear and red rage. But no hidden assassin leaped upon
him, and a wary exploration of the shack revealed nothing.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief Brill locked the doors, made fast the
windows and lighted his old coal-oil lamp. The thought of old Lopez
lying, a glassy-eyed corpse alone in the hut across the creek, made
him wince and shiver, but he did not intend to start for town on
foot in the night.</p>

<p>He drew from its hiding-place his reliable old Colt .45, spun
the blue-steel cylinder, and grinned mirthlessly. Maybe the killer
did not intend to leave any witnesses to his crime alive. Well, let
him come! He&mdash;or they&mdash;would find a young cowpuncher with
a six-shooter less easy prey than an old unarmed Mexican. And that
reminded Brill of the papers he had brought from the hut. Taking
care that he was not in line with a window through which a sudden
bullet might come, he settled himself to read, with one ear alert
for stealthy sounds.</p>

<p>And as he read the crude laborious script, a slow cold horror
grew in his soul. It was a tale of fear that the old Mexican had
scrawled&mdash;a tale handed down from generation to
generation&mdash;a tale of ancient times.</p>

<p>And Brill read of the wanderings of the caballero Hernando de
Estrada and his armored pikemen, who dared the deserts of the
Southwest when all was strange and unknown. There were some
forty-odd soldiers, servants, and masters, at the beginning, the
manuscript ran. There was the captain, de Estrada, and the priest,
and young Juan Zavilla, and Don Santiago de Valdez&mdash;a
mysterious nobleman who had been taken off a helplessly floating
ship in the Caribbean Sea&mdash;all the others of the crew and
passengers had died of plague, he had said and he had cast their
bodies overboard. So de Estrada had taken him aboard the ship that
was bearing the expedition from Spain, and de Valdez joined them in
their explorations.</p>

<p>Brill read something of their wanderings, told in the crude
style of old Lopez, as the old Mexican's ancestors had handed down
the tale for over three hundred years. The bare written words dimly
reflected the terrific hardships the explorers had
encountered&mdash;drouth, thirst, floods, the desert sandstorms,
the spears of hostile redskins. But it was of another peril that
old Lopez told&mdash;a grisly lurking horror that fell upon the
lonely caravan wandering through the immensity of the wild. Man by
man they fell and no man knew the slayer. Fear and black suspicion
ate at the heart of the expedition like a canker, and their leader
knew not where to turn. This they all knew: among them was a fiend
in human form.</p>

<p>Men began to draw apart from each other, to scatter along the
line of march, and this mutual suspicion, that sought security in
solitude, made it easier for the fiend. The skeleton of the
expedition staggered through the wilderness, lost, dazed and
helpless, and still the unseen horror hung on their flanks,
dragging down the stragglers, preying on drowsing sentries and
sleeping men. And on the throat of each was found the wounds of
pointed fangs that bled the victim white; so that the living knew
with what manner of evil they had to deal. Men reeled through the
wild, calling on the saints, or blaspheming in their terror,
fighting frenziedly against sleep, until they fell with exhaustion
and sleep stole on them with horror and death.</p>

<p>Suspicion centered on a great black man, a cannibal slave from
Calabar. And they put him in chains. But young Juan Zavilla went
the way of the rest, and then the priest was taken. But the priest
fought off his fiendish assailant and lived long enough to gasp the
demon's name to de Estrada. And Brill, shuddering and wide-eyed,
read:</p>

<p>"...And now it was evident to de Estrada that the good priest
had spoken the truth, and the slayer was Don Santiago de Valdez,
who was a vampire, an undead fiend, subsisting on the blood of the
living. And de Estrada called to mind a certain foul nobleman who
had lurked, in the mountains of Castile since the days of the
Moors, feeding off the blood of helpless victims which lent him a
ghastly immortality. This nobleman had been driven forth; none knew
where he had fled but it was evident that he and Don Santiago were
the same man: He had fled Spain by ship, and de Estrada knew that
the people of that ship had died, not by plague as the fiend had
represented, but by the fangs of the vampire."</p>

<p>"De Estrada and the black man and the few soldiers who still
lived went searching for him and found him stretched in bestial
sleep in a clump of chaparral; full-gorged he was with human blood
from his last victim. Now it is well known that a vampire, like a
great serpent, when well gorged, falls into a deep sleep and may be
taken without peril. But de Estrada was at a loss as to how to
dispose of the monster, for how may the dead be slain? For a
vampire is a man who has died long ago, yet is quick with a certain
foul unlife."</p>

<p>"The men urged that the Caballero drive a stake through the
fiend's heart and cut off his head, uttering the holy words that
would crumble the long-dead body into dust, but the priest was dead
and de Estrada feared that in the act the monster might waken."</p>

<p>"So they took Don Santiago, lifting him softly, and bore him to
an old Indian mound near by. This they opened, taking forth the
bones they found there, and they placed the vampire within and
sealed up the mound&mdash;Dios grant until Judgment Day."</p>

<p>"It is a place accursed, and I wish I had starved elsewhere
before I came into this part of the country seeking work&mdash;for
I have known of the land and the creek and the mound with its
terrible secret, ever since childhood; so you see, Señor Brill, why
you must not open the mound and wake the fiend&mdash;"</p>

<p>There the manuscript ended with an erratic scratch of the pencil
that tore the crumpled leaf.</p>

<p>Brill rose, his heart pounding wildly, his face bloodless, his
tongue cleaving to his palate. He gagged and found words.</p>

<p>"That's why the spur was in the mound&mdash;one of them
Spaniards dropped it while they was diggin'&mdash;and I mighta
knowed it's been dug into before, the way the charcoal was
scattered out&mdash;but, good God&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aghast he shrank from the black visions&mdash;an undead monster
stirring in the gloom of his tomb, thrusting from within to push
aside the stone loosened by the pick of ignorance&mdash;a shadowy
shape loping over the hill toward a light that betokened a human
prey&mdash;a frightful long arm that crossed a dim-lighted
window...</p>

<p>"It's madness!" he gasped. "Lopez was plumb loco! They ain't no
such things as vampires! If they is, why didn't he get me first,
instead of Lopez&mdash;unless he was scoutin' around, makin' sure
of everything before he pounced? Aw, hell! It's all a
pipe-dream&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words froze in his throat. At the window a face glared and
gibbered soundlessly at him. Two icy eyes pierced his very soul. A
shriek burst from his throat and that ghastly visage vanished. But
the very air was permeated by the foul scent that had hung about
the ancient mound. And now the door creaked&mdash;bent slowly
inward. Brill backed up against the wall, his gun shaking in his
hand: It did not occur to him to fire through the door; in his
chaotic brain he had but one thought that only that thin portal of
wood separated him from some horror born out of the womb of night
and gloom and the black past. His eyes were distended as he saw the
door give, as he heard the staples of the bolt groan.</p>

<p>The door burst inward. Brill did not scream. His tongue was
frozen to the roof of his mouth. His fear-glazed eyes took in the
tall, vulture-like form&mdash;the icy eyes, the long black
fingernails&mdash;the moldering garb, hideously ancient&mdash;the
long spurred boot&mdash;the slouch-hat with its crumbling
feather&mdash;the flowing cloak that was falling to slow shreds.
Framed in the black doorway crouched that abhorrent shape out of
the past, and Brill's brain reeled. A savage cold radiated from the
figure&mdash;the scent of moldering clay and charnel-house refuse.
And then the undead came at the living like a swooping vulture.</p>

<p>Brill fired point-blank and saw a shred of rotten cloth fly from
the Thing's breast. The vampire reeled beneath the impact of the
heavy ball, then righted himself and came on with frightful speed.
Brill reeled back against the wall with a choking cry, the gun
falling from his nerveless hand. The black legends were true
then&mdash;human weapons were powerless&mdash;for may a man kill
one already dead for long centuries, as mortals die?</p>

<p>Then the clawlike hands at his throat roused the young
cowpuncher to a frenzy of madness. As his pioneer ancestors fought
hand to hand against brain-shattering odds, Steve Brill fought the
cold dead crawling thing that sought his life and his soul.</p>

<p>Of that ghastly battle Brill never remembered much. It was a
blind chaos in which he screamed beast-like, tore and slugged and
hammered, where long black nails like the talons of a panther tore
at him, and pointed teeth snapped again and again at his throat.
Rolling and tumbling about the room, both half enveloped by the
musty folds of that ancient rotting cloak, they smote and tore at
each other among the ruins of the shattered furniture,
and&mdash;the fury of the vampire was not more terrible than the
fear-crazed desperation of his victim.</p>

<p>They crashed headlong, into the table, knocking it down upon its
side, and the coal oil lamp splintered on the floor, spraying the
walls with sudden flames. Brill felt the bite of the burning oil
that spattered him, but in the red frenzy of the fight he gave no
heed. The black talons were tearing at him, the inhuman eyes
burning icily into his soul; between his frantic fingers the
withered flesh of the monster was hard as dry wood. And wave after
wave of blind madness swept over Steve Brill. Like a man battling a
nightmare he screamed and smote, while all about them the fire
leaped up and caught at the walls and roof.</p>

<p>Through darting jets and licking tongues of flames they reeled
and rolled like a demon and a mortal warring on the firelanced
floors of hell: And in the growing tumult of the flames, Brill
gathered himself for one last volcanic burst of frenzied strength.
Breaking away and staggering, up, gasping and bloody, he lunged
blindly at the foul shape and caught it in a grip not even the
vampire could break. And whirling his fiendish assailant bodily on
high, he dashed him down across the uptilted edge of the fallen
table as a man might break a stick of wood across his knee.
Something cracked like a snapping branch and the vampire fell from
Brill's grasp to writhe in a strange broken posture on the burning
floor. Yet it was not dead, for its flaming eyes still burned on
Brill with a ghastly hunger, and it strove to crawl toward him with
its broken spine, as a dying snake crawls.</p>

<p>Brill, reeling and gasping, shook the blood from his eyes, and
staggered blindly through the broken door. And as a man runs from
the portals of hell, he ran stumblingly through, the mesquite and
chaparral until he fell from utter exhaustion. Looking back he saw
the flames of the burning house and thanked God that it would burn
until the very bones of Don Santiago de Valdez were utterly
consumed and destroyed from the knowledge of men.</p>
