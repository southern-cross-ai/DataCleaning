<h2>A Thousand Deaths</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Jack London</h2>



<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I had been in the water about an hour, and cold, exhausted, with a
terrible cramp in my right calf, it seemed as though my hour had
come. Fruitlessly struggling against the strong ebb tide, I had
beheld the maddening procession of the water-front lights slip by,
but now I gave up attempting to breast the stream and contended
myself with the bitter thoughts of a wasted career, now drawing to a
close.</p>

<p>It had been my luck to come of good, English stock, but of parents
whose account with the bankers far exceeded their knowledge of
child-nature and the rearing of children. While born with a silver
spoon in my mouth, the blessed atmosphere of the home circle was to
me unknown. My father, a very learned man and a celebrated
antiquarian, gave no thought to his family, being constantly lost in
the abstractions of his study; while my mother, noted far more for
her good looks than her good sense, sated herself with the adulation
of the society in which she was perpetually plunged. I went through
the regular school and college routine of a boy of the English
bourgeoisie, and as the years brought me increasing strength and
passions, my parents suddenly became aware that I was possessed of an
immortal soul, and endeavoured to draw the curb. But it was too late;
I perpetrated the wildest and most audacious folly, and was disowned
by my people, ostracised by the society I had so long outraged, and
with the thousand pounds my father gave me, with the declaration that
he would neither see me again nor give me more, I took a first-class
passage to Australia.</p>

<p>Since then my life had been one long peregrination&mdash;from the
Orient to the Occident, from the Arctic to the Antarctic&mdash;to find
myself at last, an able seaman at thirty, in the full vigour of my
manhood, drowning in San Francisco bay because of a disastrously
successful attempt to desert my ship.</p>

<p>My right leg was drawn up by the cramp, and I was suffering the
keenest agony. A slight breeze stirred up a choppy sea, which washed
into my mouth and down my throat, nor could I prevent it. Though I
still contrived to keep afloat, it was merely mechanical, for I was
rapidly becoming unconscious. I have a dim recollection of drifting
past the sea-wall, and of catching a glimpse of an upriver steamer's
starboard light; then everything became a blank.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>I heard the low hum of insect life, and felt the balmy air of a
spring morning fanning my cheek. Gradually it assumed a rhythmic
flow, to whose soft pulsations my body seemed to respond. I floated
on the gentle bosom of a summer's sea, rising and falling with dreamy
pleasure on each crooning wave. But the pulsations grew stronger; the
humming, louder; the waves, larger, fiercer&mdash;I was dashed about on a
stormy sea. A great agony fastened upon me. Brilliant, intermittent
sparks of light flashed athwart my inner consciousness; in my ears
there was the sound of many waters; then a sudden snapping of an
intangible something, and I awoke.</p>

<p>The scene, of which I was protagonist, was a curious one. A glance
sufficed to inform me that I lay on the cabin floor of some
gentleman's yacht, in a most uncomfortable posture. On either side,
grasping my arms and working them up and down like pump handles, were
two peculiarly clad, dark-skinned creatures. Though conversant with
most aboriginal types, I could not conjecture their nationality. Some
attachment had been fastened about my head, which connected my
respiratory organs with the machine I shall next describe. My
nostrils, however, had been closed, forcing me to breathe through my
mouth. Foreshortened by the obliquity of my line of vision, I beheld
two tubes, similar to small hosing but of different composition,
which emerged from my mouth and went off at an acute angle from each
other. The first came to an abrupt termination and lay on the floor
beside me; the second traversed the floor in numerous coils,
connecting with the apparatus I have promised to describe.</p>

<p>In the days before my life had become tangential, I had dabbled
not a little in science, and, conversant with the appurtenances and
general paraphernalia of the laboratory, I appreciated the machine I
now beheld. It was composed chiefly of glass, the construction being
of that crude sort which is employed for experimentative purposes. A
vessel of water was surrounded by an air chamber, to which was fixed
a vertical tube, surmounted by a globe. In the centre of this was a
vacuum gauge. The water in the tube moved upwards and downwards,
creating alternate inhalations and exhalations, which were in turn
communicated to me through the hose. With this, and the aid of the
men who pumped my arms, so vigorously, had the process of breathing
been artificially carried on, my chest rising and falling and my
lungs expanding and contracting, till nature could be persuaded to
again take up her wonted labour.</p>

<p>As I opened my eyes the appliance about my head, nostrils and
mouth was removed. Draining a stiff three fingers of brandy, I
staggered to my feet to thank my preserver, and confronted&mdash;my
father. But long years of fellowship with danger had taught me
self-control, and I waited to see if he would recognise me. Not so;
he saw in me no more than a runaway sailor and treated me
accordingly.</p>

<p>Leaving me to the care of the blackies, he fell to revising the
notes he had made on my resuscitation. As I ate of the handsome fare
served up to me, confusion began on deck, and from the chanteys of
the sailors and the rattling of blocks and tackles I surmised that we
were getting under way. What a lark! Off on a cruise with my recluse
father into the wide Pacific! Little did I realise, as I laughed to
myself, which side the joke was to be on. Aye, had I known, I would
have plunged overboard and welcomed the dirty fo'c'sle from which I
had just escaped.</p>

<p>I was not allowed on deck till we had sunk the Farallones and the
last pilot boat. I appreciated this forethought on the part of my
father and made it a point to thank him heartily, in my bluff
seaman's manner. I could not suspect that he had his own ends in
view, in thus keeping my presence secret to all save the crew. He
told me briefly of my rescue by his sailors, assuring me that the
obligation was on his side, as my appearance had been most opportune.
He had constructed the apparatus for the vindication of a theory
concerning certain biological phenomena, and had been waiting for an
opportunity to use it.</p>

<p>"You have proved it beyond all doubt," he said; then added with a
sigh, "But only in the small matter of drowning."</p>

<p>But, to take a reef in my yarn&mdash;he offered me an advance of two
pounds on my previous wages to sail with him, and this I considered
handsome, for he really did not need me. Contrary to my expectations,
I did not join the sailor' mess, for'ard, being assigned to a
comfortable stateroom and eating at the captain's table. He had
perceived that I was no common sailor, and I resolved to take this
chance for reinstating myself in his good graces. I wove a fictitious
past to account for my education and present position, and did my
best to come in touch with him. I was not long in disclosing a
predilection for scientific pursuits, nor he in appreciating my
aptitude. I became his assistant, with a corresponding increase in
wages, and before long, as he grew confidential and expounded his
theories, I was as enthusiastic as himself.</p>

<p>The days flew quickly by, for I was deeply interested in my new
studies, passing my waking hours in his well-stocked library, or
listening to his plans and aiding him in his laboratory work. But we
were forced to forego many enticing experiments, a rolling ship not
being exactly the proper place for delicate or intricate work. He
promised me, however, many delightful hours in the magnificent
laboratory for which we were bound. He had taken possession of an
uncharted South Sea island, as he said, and turned it into a
scientific paradise.</p>

<p>We had not been on the island long, before I discovered the
horrible mare's nest I had fallen into. But before I describe the
strange things which came to pass, I must briefly outline the causes
which culminated in as startling an experience as ever fell to the
lot of man.</p>

<p>Late in life, my father had abandoned the musty charms of
antiquity and succumbed to the more fascinating ones embraced under
the general head of biology. Having been thoroughly grounded during
his youth in the fundamentals, he rapidly explored all the higher
branches as far as the scientific world had gone, and found himself
on the no man's land of the unknowable. It was his intention to
pre-empt some of this unclaimed territory, and it was at this stage
of his investigations that we had been thrown together. Having a good
brain, though I say it myself, I had mastered his speculations and
methods of reasoning, becoming almost as mad as himself. But I should
not say this. The marvellous results we afterwards obtained can only
go to prove his sanity. I can but say that he was the most abnormal
specimen of cold-blooded cruelty I have ever seen.</p>

<p>After having penetrated the dual mysteries of physiology and
psychology, his thought had led him to the verge of a great field,
for which, the better to explore, he began studies in higher organic
chemistry, pathology, toxicology and other sciences and sub-sciences
rendered kindred as accessories to his speculative hypotheses.
Starting from the proposition that the direct cause of the temporary
and permanent arrest of vitality was due to the coagulation of
certain elements and compounds in the protoplasm, he had isolated and
subjected these various substances to innumerable experiments. Since
the temporary arrest of vitality in an organism brought coma, and a
permanent arrest death, he held that by artificial means this
coagulation of the protoplasm could be retarded, prevented, and even
overcome in the extreme states of solidification. Or, to do away with
the technical nomenclature, he argued that death, when not violent
and in which none of the organs had suffered injury, was merely
suspended vitality; and that, in such instances, life could be
induced to resume its functions by the use of proper methods. This,
then, was his idea: To discover the method&mdash;and by practical
experimentation prove the possibility&mdash;of renewing vitality in a
structure from which life had seemingly fled. Of course, he
recognised the futility of such endeavour after decomposition had set
in; he must have organisms which but the moment, the hour, or the day
before, had been quick with life. With me, in a crude way, he had
proved this theory. I was really drowned, really dead, when picked
from the water of San Francisco bay&mdash;but the vital spark had been
renewed by means of his aerotherapeutical apparatus, as he called
it.</p>

<p>Now to his dark purpose concerning me. He first showed me how
completely I was in his power. He had sent the yacht away for a year,
retaining only his two blackies, who were utterly devoted to him. He
then made an exhaustive review of his theory and outlined the method
of proof he had adopted, concluding with the startling announcement
that I was to be his subject.</p>

<p>I had faced death and weighed my chances in many a desperate
venture, but never in one of this nature. I can swear I am no coward,
yet this proposition of journeying back and forth across the
borderland of death put the yellow fear upon me. I asked for time,
which he granted, at the same time assuring me that but the one
course was open&mdash;I must submit. Escape from the Island was out of the
question; escape by suicide was not to be entertained, though really
preferable to what it seemed I must undergo; my only hope was to
destroy my captors. But this latter was frustrated through the
precautions taken by my father. I was subjected to a constant
surveillance, even in my sleep being guarded by one or the other of
the blacks.</p>

<p>Having pleaded in vain, I announced and proved that I was his son.
It was my last card, and I had played all my hopes upon it. But he
was inexorable; he was not a father but a scientific machine. I
wonder yet how it ever came to pass that he married my mother or
begat me, for there was not the slightest grain of emotion in his
make-up. Reason was all in all to him, nor could he understand such
things as love or sympathy in others, except as petty weaknesses
which should be overcome. So he informed me that in the beginning he
had given me life, and who had better right to take it away than he?
Such, he said, was not his desire, however; he merely wished to
borrow it occasionally, promising to return it punctually at the
appointed time. Of course, there was a liability of mishaps, but I
could do no more than take the chances, since the affairs of men were
full of such.</p>

<p>The better to insure success, he wished me to be in the best
possible condition, so I was dieted and trained like a great athlete
before a decisive contest. What could I do? If I had to undergo the
peril, it were best to be in good shape. In my intervals of
relaxation he allowed me to assist in the arranging of the apparatus
and in the various subsidiary experiments. The interest I took in all
such operations can be imagined. I mastered the work as thoroughly as
he, and often had the pleasure of seeing some of my suggestions or
alterations put into effect. After such events I would smile grimly,
conscious of officiating at my own funeral.</p>

<p>He began by inaugurating a series of experiments in toxicology.
When all was ready, I was killed by a stiff dose of strychnine and
allowed to lie dead for some twenty hours. During that period my body
was dead, absolutely dead. All respiration and circulation ceased;
but the frightful part of it was, that while the protoplasmic
coagulation proceeded, I retained consciousness and was enabled to
study it in all its ghastly details.</p>

<p>The apparatus to bring me back to life was an air-tight chamber,
fitted to receive my body. The mechanism was simple&mdash;a few valves, a
rotary shaft and crank, and an electric motor. When in operation, the
interior atmosphere was alternately condenses and rarefied, thus
communicating to my lungs an artificial respiration without the
agency of the hosing previously used. Though my body was inert, and,
for all I knew, in the first stages of decomposition, I was cognisant
of everything that transpired. I knew when they placed me in the
chamber, and though all my senses were quiescent, I was aware of
hypodermic injections of a compound to react upon the coagulatory
process. Then the chamber was closed and the machinery started. My
anxiety was terrible; but the circulation became gradually restored,
the different organs began to carry on their respective functions,
and in an hour's time I was eating a hearty dinner.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that I participated in this series, nor in the
subsequent ones, with much verve; but after two ineffectual attempts
of escape, I began to take quite an interest. Besides, I was becoming
accustomed. My father was beside himself at his success, and as the
months rolled by his speculations took wilder and yet wilder flights.
We ranged through the three great classes of poisons, the neurotics,
the gaseous and the irritants, but carefully avoided some of the
mineral irritants and passed the whole group of corrosives. During
the poison regime I became quite accustomed to dying, and had but one
mishap to shake my growing confidence. Scarifying a number of lesser
blood vessels in my arm, he introduced a minute quantity of that most
frightful of poisons, the arrow poison, or curare. I lost
consciousness at the start, quickly followed by the cessation of
respiration and circulation, and so far had the solidification of the
protoplasm advanced, that he gave up all hope. But at the last moment
he applied a discovery he had been working upon, receiving such
encouragement as to redouble his efforts.</p>

<p>In a glass vacuum, similar but not exactly like a Crookes' tube,
was placed a magnetic field. When penetrated by polarised light, it
gave no phenomena of phosphorescence nor the rectilinear projection
of atoms, but emitted non-luminous rays, similar to the X-ray. While
the X-ray could reveal opaque objects hidden in dense mediums, this
was possessed of far subtler penetration. By this he photographed my
body, and found on the negative an infinite number of blurred
shadows, due to the chemical and electric motions still going on.
This was an infallible proof that the rigor mortis in which I lay was
not genuine; that is, those mysterious forces, those delicate bonds
which held my soul to my body, were still in action. The resultants
of all other poisons were unapparent, save those of mercurial
compounds, which usually left me languid for several days.</p>

<p>Another series of delightful experiments was with electricity. We
verified Tesla's assertion that high currents were utterly harmless
by passing 100,000 volts through my body. As this did not affect me,
the current was reduced to 2,500, and I was quickly electrocuted.
This time he ventured so far as to allow me to remain dead, or in a
state of suspended vitality, for three days. It took four hours to
bring me back.</p>

<p>Once, he superinduced lockjaw; but the agony of dying was so great
that I positively refused to undergo similar experiments. The easiest
deaths were by asphyxiation, such as drowning, strangling, and
suffocation by gas; while those by morphine, opium, cocaine and
chloroform, were not at all hard.</p>

<p>Another time, after being suffocated, he kept me in cold storage
for three months, not permitting me to freeze or decay. This was
without my knowledge, and I was in a great fright on discovering the
lapse of time. I became afraid of what he might do with me when I lay
dead, my alarm being increased by the predilection he was beginning
to betray towards vivisection. The last time I was resurrected, I
discovered that he had been tampering with my breast. Though he had
carefully dressed and sewed the incisions up, they were so severe
that I had to take to my bed for some time. It was during this
convalescence that I evolved the plan by which I ultimately
escaped.</p>

<p>While feigning unbounded enthusiasm in the work, I asked and
received a vacation from my moribund occupation. During this period I
devoted myself to laboratory work, while he was too deep in the
vivisection of the many animals captured by the blacks to take notice
of my work.</p>

<p>It was on these two propositions that I constructed my theory:
First, electrolysis, or the decomposition of water into its
constituent gases by means of electricity; and, second, by the
hypothetical existence of a force, the converse of gravitation, which
Astor has named "apergy". Terrestrial attraction, for instance,
merely draws objects together but does not combine them; hence,
apergy is merely repulsion. Now, atomic or molecular attraction not
only draws objects together but integrates them; and it was the
converse of this, or a disintegrative force, which I wished to not
only discover and produce, but to direct at will. Thus, the molecules
of hydrogen and oxygen reacting on each other, separate and create
new molecules, containing both elements and forming water.
Electrolysis causes these molecules to split up and resume their
original condition, producing the two gases separately. The force I
wished to find must not only do this with two, but with all elements,
no matter in what compounds they exist. If I could then entice my
father within its radius, he would be instantly disintegrated and
sent flying to the four quarters, a mass of isolated elements.</p>

<p>It must not be understood that this force, which I finally came to
control, annihilated matter; it merely annihilated form. Nor, as I
soon discovered, had it any effect on inorganic structure; but to all
organic form it was absolutely fatal. This partiality puzzled me at
first, though had I stopped to think deeper I would have seen through
it. Since the number of atoms in organic molecules is far greater
than in the most complex mineral molecules, organic compounds are
characterised by their instability and the ease with which they are
split up by physical forces and chemical reagents.</p>

<p>By two powerful batteries, connected with magnets constructed
specially for this purpose, two tremendous forces were projected.
Considered apart from each other, they were perfectly harmless; but
they accomplished their purpose by focusing at an invisible point in
mid-air. After practically demonstrating its success, besides
narrowly escaping being blown into nothingness, I laid my trap.
Concealing the magnets, so that their force made the whole space of
my chamber doorway a field of death, and placing by my couch a button
by which I could throw on the current from the storage batteries, I
climbed into bed.</p>

<p>The blackies still guarded my sleeping quarters, one relieving the
other at midnight. I turned on the current as soon as the first man
arrived. Hardly had I begun to doze, when I was aroused by a sharp,
metallic tinkle. There, on the mid-threshold, lay the collar of Dan,
my father's St. Bernard. My keeper ran to pick it up. He disappeared
like a gust of wind, his clothes falling to the floor in a heap.
There was a slight wiff of ozone in the air, but since the principal
gaseous components of his body were hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen,
which are equally colourless and odourless, there was no other
manifestation of his departure. Yet when I shut off the current and
removed the garments, I found a deposit of carbon in the form of
animal charcoal; also other powders, the isolated, solid elements of
his organism, such as sulphur, potassium and iron. Resetting the
trap, I crawled back to bed. At midnight I got up and removed the
remains of the second black, and then slept peacefully till
morning.</p>

<p>I was awakened by the strident voice of my father, who was calling
to me from across the laboratory. I laughed to myself. There had been
no one to call him and he had overslept. I could hear him as he
approached my room with the intention of rousing me, and so I sat up
in bed, the better to observe his translation&mdash;perhaps apotheosis
were a better term. He paused a moment at the threshold, then took
the fatal step. Puff! It was like the wind sighing among the pines.
He was gone. His clothes fell in a fantastic heap on the floor.
Besides ozone, I noticed the faint, garlic-like odour of phosphorus.
A little pile of elementary solids lay among his garments. That was
all. The wide world lay before me. My captors were no more.</p>
