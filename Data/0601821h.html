<img src="0601821h-images/Armageddon-E.gif"
style="float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p class="first">LSEWHERE I have set down, for whatever interest
they have in this, the 25th Century, my personal recollections of
the 20th Century.</p>

<p>Now it occurs to me that my memories of the 25th Century may
have an equal interest 500 years from now&mdash;particularly in
view of that unique perspective from which I have seen the 25th
Century, entering it as I did, in one leap across a gap of 492
years.</p>

<p>This statement requires elucidation. There are still many in
the world who are not familiar with my unique experience. I
should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I
know the only man alive whose normal span of life has been spread
over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first
twenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the rest
since 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly a five
hundred years, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free
from the ravages of catabolic processes, and without any apparent
effect on my physical or mental faculties.</p>

<p>When I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real
conquest of the air in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in
airplanes driven by internal combustion motors. He had barely
begun to speculate on the possibilities of harnessing sub-atomic
forces, and had made no further practical penetration into the
field of ethereal pulsations than the primitive radio and
television of that day. The United States of America was the most
powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,
industrial and scientific influence being supreme.</p>

<p>I awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck&mdash;to find
Americans a hunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense
forests that covered the shattered and leveled ruins of their
once magnificent cities, desperately preserving, and struggling
to develop in their secret retreats, the remnants of their
culture and science and their independence.</p>

<p>World domination was in the hands of Mongolians, and the
center of world power lay in inland China, with Americans one of
the few races of mankind unsubdued&mdash;and it must be admitted
in fairness to the truth, not worth the trouble of subduing in
the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled North America as titular
tributaries of the Most Magnificent.</p>

<p>For they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived,
nor the resources of the vast territories these forests covered.
With the perfection to which they had reduced the synthetic
production of necessities and luxuries, their development of
scientific processes and mechanical accomplishments of work, they
had no economic need for the forests, and no economic desire for
the enslaved labor of an unruly race.</p>

<p>They had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious
scheme of civilization within the walls of the fifteen cities of
sparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient
American centers, into the bowels of the earth underneath them,
and with relatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.</p>

<p>Complete domination of the air rendered communication between
these centers a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive
raids on the wastelands were considered all that was necessary to
keep the "wild" Americans on the run within the shelter of their
forests, and prevent their becoming a menace to the Han
civilization.</p>

<p>But nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security,
the last century of which had been nearly sterile in scientific,
social and economic progress, had softened them.</p>

<p>It had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of
the forest, the growth of a vigorous new American civilization,
remarkable in the mobility and flexibility of its organization,
in its conquest of almost insuperable obstacles, and in the
development and guarding of its industrial and scientific
resources. All this was in anticipation of that "Day of Hope" to
which Americans had been looking forward for generations, when
they would be strong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of
the forests, soar into the upper air lanes and destroy the
Hans.</p>

<p>At the time I awoke, the "Day of Hope" was almost at hand. I
shall not attempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second
War of Independence, for that has been recorded already by better
historians that I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to
the part I was fortunate enough to play in this struggle and in
the events leading up to it.</p>

<p>It all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During
the latter part of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas
Corporation, had been keeping me busy investigating reports of
unusual phenomena observed in certain abandoned coal mines near
the Wyoming Valley, in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>With two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific
instruments, I began the exploration of a deserted working in a
mountainous district, where several weeks before, a number of
mining engineers had reported traces of carnotite[*] and what
they believed to be radioactive gases. Their report was not
without foundation, it was apparent from the outset, for in our
examination of the upper levels of the mine, our instruments
indicated a vigorous radioactivity.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; then used as a source of radium compounds. &mdash;Ed.]

<p>On the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the
lowest levels. To our surprise, we found no water there.
Obviously it had drained off through some break in the strata. We
noticed too that the rock in the side walls of the shaft was
soft, evidently due to the radioactivity, and pieces crumbled
underfoot rather easily. We made our way cautiously down the
shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us gave way.</p>

<p>I jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft
rock; my companions, who were several paces behind me, were
buried under it, and undoubtedly met instant death.</p>

<p>I was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I
explored the shaft to its end, but could find no other way out.
The air became increasingly difficult to breathe, probably from
the rapid accumulation of the radioactive gas. In a little while
my senses reeled and I lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of
air in the shaft. I had not thought that I had been unconscious
more than a few hours, although it seems that the radioactive gas
had kept me in a state of suspended animation for something like
500 years. My awakening, I figured out later, had been due to
some shifting of the strata which reopened the shaft and cleared
the atmosphere in the working. This must have been the case, for
I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a pile of debris,
and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the mine, where
an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest and no
visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my
attempt to grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I
felt that I was on the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar
forest like a lost soul. Had it not been for the necessity of
improvising traps and crude clubs with which to slay my food, I
believe I should have gone mad.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic
crisis. I shall begin my narrative proper with my first contact
with Americans of the year 2419 A.D.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; FLOATING MEN</h2>

<p class="first">My first glimpse of a human being of the 25th
Century was obtained through a portion of woodland where the
trees were thinly scattered, with a dense forest beyond.</p>

<p>I had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing
over my strange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously
backed out of the dense growth across the glade. I was about to
call out joyfully, but there was something furtive about the
figure that prevented me. The boy's attention (for it seemed to
be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was centered tensely on the heavy
growth of the trees from which he had just emerged.</p>

<p>He was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of
green, and wore a helmet-like cap of the same color. High around
his waist he wore a broad thick belt, which bulked up in the back
across the shoulders into something of the proportions of a
knapsack.</p>

<p>As I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and
heavy detonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the
left of him. He threw up an arm and staggered a bit in a queer,
gliding way; then he recovered himself and slipped cautiously
away from the place of the explosion, crouching slightly, and
still facing the denser part of the forest. Every few steps he
would raise his arm, and point into the forest with something he
held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was a terrible
explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that he
was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither
flash nor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.</p>

<p>After firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden
resolution, and turning in my general direction, leaped&mdash;to
my amazement sailing through the air between the sparsely
scattered trees in such a jump as I had never in my life seen
before. That leap must have carried him a full fifty feet,
although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten or
twelve feet from the ground.</p>

<p>When he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he
sprawled gently forward. I say "gently" for he did not crash down
as I expected him to do. The only thing I could compare it with
was a slow-motion cinema, although I have never seen one in which
horizontal motions were registered at normal speed and only the
vertical movements were slowed down.</p>

<p>Due to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with
its normal quickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several
seconds before I saw the blood that oozed out from under the
tight green cap. Regaining my power of action, I dragged him out
of sight back of the big tree. For a few moments I busied myself
in an attempt to staunch the flow of blood. The wound was not a
deep one. My companion was more dazed than hurt. But what of the
pursuers?</p>

<p>I took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It
was not unlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed,
except that it apparently fired with a button instead of a
trigger. I inserted several fresh rounds of ammunition into its
magazine from my companion's belt as rapidly as I could, for I
soon heard near us, the suppressed conversation of his
pursuers.</p>

<p>There followed a series of explosions round about us, but none
very close. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and
were firing at random.</p>

<p>I waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom
myself to its weight and probable throw.</p>

<p>Then I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far
away, and the head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion,
he was clad entirely in green, which made his figure difficult to
distinguish. But his face could be seen clearly, and had murder
in it.</p>

<p>That decided me, I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad,
for there was no kick in the gun, as I had expected. I hit the
trunk of the tree several feet below him. It blew him from his
perch like a crumpled bit of paper, and he floated down to the
ground, like some limp, dead thing, gently lowered by an
invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown apart by the explosion,
crashed down.</p>

<p>There followed another series of explosions around us. These
guns we were using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents
were evidently as much at sea as to my position as I was to
theirs. So I made no attempt to reply to their fire, contenting
myself with keeping a sharp lookout in their general direction.
And patience had its reward.</p>

<p>Very soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another
tree. Exposing myself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at
the tree trunk and fired again. A shriek followed the explosion.
I heard the tree crash down, then a groan.</p>

<p>There was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of
boughs swishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing
the button as rapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my
shells had exploded, but there was no body.</p>

<p>Now I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing
leaps from the bough of one tree to another about forty feet
away.</p>

<p>I threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten
the feel of the weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The
"bullet" must have penetrated his body and exploded, for one
moment I saw him flying through the air; then the explosion, and
he had vanished. He never finished his leap.</p>

<p>How many more of them there were I don't know, but this must
have been too much for them. They used a final round of shells on
us, all of which exploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard
them swishing and crashing away from us through the tree tops.
Not one of them descended to earth.</p>

<p>Now I had time to give some attention to my companion. She
was, I found, a girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky
appearance, due to the peculiar belt strapped around her body
high up under the arms, she was very slender, and very
pretty.</p>

<p>There was a stream not far away, from which I brought water
and bathed her face and wound.</p>

<p>Apparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like
ability to jump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that
floated gently down instead of falling, lay in the belt. The
thing was some sort of anti-gravity belt that almost balanced the
weight of the wearer, thereby tremendously multiplying the
propulsive power of the leg muscles, and the lifting power of the
arms.</p>

<p>When the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did
her, and promptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation
puzzled me a lot, but nevertheless we were able to understand
each other fairly well, except for certain words and phrases. I
explained what had happened while she lay unconscious, and she
thanked me simply for saving her life.</p>

<p>"'You are a strange exchange," she said, eying my clothing
quizzically. Evidently she found it mirth-provoking by contrast
with her own neatly efficient garb. "Don't you understand what I
mean by exchange?' I mean&mdash;ah&mdash;let me see&mdash;a
stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do you belong
to?" (She pronounced it "gan," with only a suspicion of a nasal
sound.)</p>

<p>I laughed. "I'm not a gangster," I said. But she evidently did
not understand this word. "I don't belong to any gang," I
explained, "and never did. Does everybody belong to a gang
nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," she said, frowning. "If you don't belong to a
gang, where and how do you live? Why have you not found and
joined a gang? How do you eat? Where do you get your
clothing?"</p>

<p>"I've been eating wild game for the past two weeks," I
explained, "and this clothing I&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;" I
paused, wondering how I could explain that it must be many
hundred years old.</p>

<p>In the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I
could, piecing it together with my assumptions as to what had
happened. She listened patiently; incredulously at first, but
less so as I went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a
long time.</p>

<p>"That's hard to believe," she said, "but I believe it." She
looked me over with frank interest.</p>

<p>"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down
in that mine?" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never
married. "Well, that simplifies matters," she continued. "You
see, if you were technically classed as a family man; I could
take you back only as an invited exchange and I, being unmarried,
and no relation of yours, couldn't do the inviting."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE FOREST GANGS</h2>

<p class="first">SHE gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar
social and economic system under which her people lived. At least
it seemed very peculiar from my 20th Century view-point.</p>

<p>I learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed
over my head as I lay unconscious in the mine.</p>

<p>Wilma Deering, for that was her name, did not profess to be a
historian, and so could give me only a sketchy outline of the
wars that had been fought, and the manner in which such radical
changes had come about. It seemed that another war had followed
the First World War, in which nearly all the European nations had
banded together to break the financial and industrial power of
America. They succeeded in their purpose, though they were
beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like
themselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the
hollow shell of a victory.</p>

<p>This opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who
had made a coalition with the Chinese to sweep over all Europe
and reduce it to a state of chaos.</p>

<p>America, industrially geared to world production and the world
trade, collapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of
stagnation and desperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But
it was impossible to stave off war with the Mongolians, who by
now had subjugated the Russians, and were aiming at a world
empire.</p>

<p>In about 2109, it seems the conflict was finally precipitated.
The Mongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a
science that far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in
over the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada,
annihilating American aircraft, armies and cities with their
terrific disintegrator ray. These rays were projected from a
machine not unlike a searchlight in appearance, the reflector of
which, however, was not material substance, but a complicated
balance of interacting electronic forces. This resulted in a
terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material
substance melted into "nothingness"; i.e., into electronic
vibrations. It destroyed all then known substances, from air to
the most dense metals and stone.</p>

<p>They settled down to the establishment of what became known as
the Han dynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World
Empire.</p>

<p>Those were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted
like wild beasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in
mountains, canyons and forests. Government was at an end among
them. Anarchy prevailed for several generations. Most would have
been eager to submit to the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But
the Hans did not want them, for they themselves had marvelous
machinery and scientific process by which all difficult labor was
accomplished.</p>

<p>Ultimately they stopped their active search for, and
annihilation of the widely scattered groups of now savage
Americans. So long as Americans remained hidden in their forests,
and did not venture near the great cities the Hans had built,
little attention was paid to them.</p>

<p>Then began the building of the new American civilization.
Families and individuals gathered together in clans or "gangs"
for mutual protection. For nearly a century they lived a nomadic
and primitive life, moving from place to place, in desperate fear
of the casual and occasional Han air raids, and the terrible
disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these raids decreased,
they began to stay permanently in given localities, organizing
upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of the
military households of the Norman feudal barons. However, instead
of gathering together in castles, American defense tactics
necessitated a certain scattering of living quarters for families
and individuals. They lived virtually in the open air, in the
forests, in green tents, resorting to camouflage tactics that
would conceal their presence from air observers. They dug
underground factories and laboratories that they might better be
shielded from the electronic detectors of the Hans. They tapped
the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude instruments
at first, better ones later on. They bent every effort toward the
redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored as
unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge
piecemeal.</p>

<p>During the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly
wars fought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous
but childishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly
punitive raids.</p>

<p>But as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood
redeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs
over constantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain
extent, between one gang and another; but the interchange of
knowledge became more important than that of goods as skill in
the handling of synthetic processes developed.</p>

<p>Within the gang, an economy was developed that was a
compromise between individual liberty and a military socialism.
The right of private property was limited practically to personal
possessions, but private privileges were many, and sacredly
regarded. Stimulation to achievement lay chiefly in the winning
of various kinds of leadership and prerogatives. There could be
only a very limited degree of owning anything that might be
classified as "wealth," and nothing that might be classified as
"resources." Resources of every description, for military safety
and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the
community as a whole.</p>

<p>In the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had
developed a luxury economy. The Americans were regarded as "wild
men of the woods." And since the Hans neither needed nor wanted
the woods or the wild men, they treated Americans as beasts, and
were conscious of no human brotherhood with them. As time went
on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and materials were
further developed, less and less ground was needed by the Hans
for the purposes of agriculture; finally, even the working of
mines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from
electronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.</p>

<p>The Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries with
machinery and scientific processes to satisfy its every want,
with virtually no necessity of labor, began to assume a defensive
attitude toward the Americans.</p>

<p>And quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a
deep, grim hatred; they longed desperately for the day when they
should be powerful enough to rise and annihilate the Mongolian
Blight that lay over the continent.</p>

<p>At the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely
organized, but were considering the establishment of a special
military force, whose special business it would be to harry the
Hans and bring down their air ships whenever possible, without
causing general alarm among the Mongolians.</p>

<p>Wilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which
claimed the entire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the
leadership of Boss Hart. Her mother and father were dead, and she
was unmarried, so she was not a "family member." She lived in a
little group of tents known as Camp 17, under a woman Camp Boss,
with seven other girls.</p>

<p>Her duties alternated between military or police scouting and
factory work. For the two-week period which would end the next
day, she had been on "air patrol" This did not mean, as I first
imagined, that she was flying, but rather that she was on the
lookout for Han ships over this outlying section of the Wyoming
territory, and had spent most of her time perched in the tree
tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she would have fired a
"drop flare" several miles off to one side, which would ignite
when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that the
direction or point from which it had been fired might not be
guessed by the airship and bring a blasting play of the
disintegrator ray in her vicinity. Other members of the air
patrol would send up rockets on seeing hers, until finally a
scout equipped with an ultrophone, which, unlike the ancient
radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations, would pass
the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming
Gang and other communities within a radius of several hundred
miles. This would also alert the few American rocketships that
might be in the air, which instantly would duck to cover either
through forest clearings or by flattening down to earth in green
fields where their coloring would probably protect them from
observation.</p>

<p>The favorite American method of propulsion was known as
"rocketing." The rocket is what I would describe, from my 20th
Century comprehension of the matter, as an extremely powerful gas
blast, atomically produced through the stimulation of chemical
action. Scientists of today regard it as a childishly simple
reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and
efficient.</p>

<p>But tomorrow, Wilma explained, she would go back to work in
the cloth plant, where she would take charge of one of the
synthetic processes by which those wonderful substitutes for
woven fabrics of wool, cotton and silk are produced. At the end
of another two weeks, she would be back on military duty again,
perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a "contact guard," on duty
where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of the
Delawares, or the "Susquannas" or one of the half dozen other
"gangs" in that section of the country which I knew as
Pennsylvania and New York States.</p>

<p>Wilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps
which she and her assailants had made, and explained in the
following manner the inertron belt balances weight: "jumpers"
were in common use at the time I "awoke," though they were
costly, for at that time inertron had not been produced in very
great quantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were
belts, strapped high under the arms, containing an amount of
inertron adjusted to the wearer's weight and purposes: In effect
they made a man weigh as little as he desired; two pounds if he
liked.</p>

<p>"Floaters" are a later development of "jumpers"&mdash;rocket
motors encased in inertron blocks and strapped to the back in
such a way that the wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly
downward. With his motor in operation, he moves like a diver,
head foremost, controlling his direction by twisting his body and
by movements of his outstretched arms and hands. Ballast weights
locked in the front of the belt adjust weight and lift. Some men
prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a slight motor
thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyancy balance of a
few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious
matter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an
extra precaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason,
there are built into every belt a number of detachable sections,
one more of which can be discarded to balance off any loss in
weight.</p>

<p>"But who were your assailants," I asked, "and why were you
attacked?"</p>

<p>Her assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang,
referred to as "Bad Bloods," a group which for several
generations had been under the domination of leaders who tried to
advance the interests of their clan by tactics which their
neighbors had come to regard as unfair, and who in consequence
had been virtually boycotted. Their purpose had been to slay
Wilma near Delaware frontier, making it appear that the crime had
been committed by Delaware scouts and thus embroil the Delawares
and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each other, or at least
cause suspicions.</p>

<p>Fortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she
had been successful in dodging them for some two hours before the
shooting began, at the moment when I arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>"But we must not stay here talking," Wilma concluded. "I have
to take you in, and besides I must report this attack right away.
I think we had better slip over to the other side of the
mountain. Whoever is on that post will have a phone, and I can
make a direct report. But you'll have to have a belt. Mine alone
won't help much against our combined weights, and there's little
to be gained by jumping heavy. It's almost as bad as
walking."</p>

<p>After a little search, we found one of the men I had killed,
who had floated down among the trees some distance away and whose
belt was not badly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it
nearly got away from me and shot up in the air. Wilma caught it,
however, and though it reinforced the lift of her own belt so
that she had to hook her knee around a branch to hold herself
down, she saved it. I climbed the tree, and with my weight added
to hers, we floated down easily.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; LIFE IN THE 25TH
CENTURY</h2>

<p class="first">WE were delayed in starting for quite a while
since I had to acquire a few crude ideas about the technique of
using these belts. I had been sitting down, for instance, with
the belt strapped about me, enjoying an ease similar to that of a
comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a natural exertion of
muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with a wild
instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma
greatly.</p>

<p>But after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging
muscular effort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of
horizontal. The correct form, I found, was a measure comparable
to that of skating. I found, also, that in forest work the arms
and hands could be used to great advantage in swinging along from
branch to branch, so prolonging leaps almost indefinitely at
times.</p>

<p>In going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th
Century muscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill
with the belt; and since the slopes were very sharp, and most of
our leaps were upward, I could have outdistanced Wilma, but when
we crossed the ridge and descended, she outstripped me with her
superior technique. Choosing the steepest slopes, she would
crouch in the top of a tree, and propel herself outward,
literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal momentum, she
would assume a more upright position and float downward. In this
manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile
in a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,
thoroughly enjoying the sensation.</p>

<p>Halfway down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure
leap out above the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched
on an outcropping of rock from which a view for many miles around
could be had, while Wilma hastily explained her adventure and my
presence to her fellow guard, whose name was Alan. I learned
later that this was the modern form of Helen.</p>

<p>"You want to report by phone then, don't you?" Alan took a
compact packet about six inches square from a holster attached to
her belt and handed it to Wilma. So far as I could see, it had no
special receiver for the ear. Wilma merely threw back a lid, as
though she were opening a book, and began to talk. The voice that
came back from the machine was as audible as her own.</p>

<p>She was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at
considerable length as to myself, and I could tell from the tone
of that voice that its owner was not prepared to take me at my
face value as readily as Wilma had. For that matter, neither was
the other girl. I could realize it from the suspicious glances
she threw my way, when she thought my attention was elsewhere,
and, the manner in which her hand hovered constantly near her gun
holster.</p>

<p>Wilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that
another scout would take her place on the other side of the
mountain. She closed down the lid of the phone and handed it back
to Alan, who seemed relieved to see us departing over the tree
tops in the direction of the camps.</p>

<p>We had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a
surprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here
on we would have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the
camps, she said, and there was always the possibility that some
small Han scoutship, invisibly high in the sky, might catch sight
of us through a projectoscope and thus find the general location
of the camps.</p>

<p>Wilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small
building of irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it,
and substantially constructed of green sheet-like material.</p>

<p>I was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my
arrival at once to the historical office, and to officials he
called the Psycho Boss and the History Boss, who came in a few
minutes later. The attitude of all three men was at first polite
but skeptical, and Wilma's ardent advocacy seemed to amuse
them.</p>

<p>For the next two hours, I talked, explained and answered
questions. I had to explain, in detail, the manner of my life in
the 20th Century and my understanding of customs, habits,
business, science and the history of that period, and about
developments in the centuries that had elapsed. Had I been in a
classroom, I would have come through the examination with a very
poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half of
their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of
these questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose
I knew nothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched
keenly as I handled them.</p>

<p>In the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show
in the faces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and
Psycho Bosses agreed openly that they could find no flaw in my
story or reactions, and that my story must be accepted as
genuine.</p>

<p>They took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man
with a "poker face." He would probably have been the successful
politician even in the 20th Century.</p>

<p>They gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of
their examination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his
acceptance of it; Then he turned to me. "How does it feel?" he
asked. "Do we look funny to you?"</p>

<p>"A bit strange," I admitted. "But I'm beginning to lose that
dazed feeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to
learn."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too," he said. "So
you fought in the First World War? Do you know, we have very
little left in the way of records of the details of that war,
that is, the precise conditions under which it was fought, and
the tactics employed. We forgot many things during the Han
terror, and&mdash;well... I think you might have a lot of ideas
worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that
you're here, and can't go back to your own century, so to speak,
what do you want to do? You're welcome to become one of us. Or
perhaps you'd just like to visit with us for a while, and then
look around among the other gangs. Maybe you'd like some of the
others better. Don't make up your mind now. We'll put you down as
an exchange for a while. Let's see. You and Bill Hearn ought to
get along well together. He's Camp Boss of Number 34 when he
isn't acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There's a vacancy in his
camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you want to.
As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know."</p>

<p>We all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died
out in five hundred years, and I set out with Hearn.</p>

<p>Bill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big
man. That is, he was about my own height, five feet eleven. This
was considerably above the average now, for the race had lost
something in stature, it seemed, through the vicissitudes of five
centuries. Most of the women were a bit below five feet, and the
men only a trifle above this height.</p>

<p>For a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp
duties, so I had a good chance to familiarize myself with the
community life. It was not easy. There were so many marvels to
absorb. I never ceased to wonder at the strange combination of
rustic social life and feverish industrial activity. At least, it
was strange to me. For in my experience, industrial development
meant crowded cities, tenements, paved streets, profusion of
vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with strained or dull
faces, vast structures and ornate public works.</p>

<p>Here, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated
families and groups, living in the heart of the forest, with a
quarter of a mile or more between households. There was a total
absence of crowds, no means of conveyance other than the belts
called jumpers, almost constantly worn by everybody, and an
occasional rocket-ship&mdash;used only for longer
journeys&mdash;and underground plants or factories that were to
my mind more like laboratories and engine rooms. Many of them
were excavations as deep as mines, with well furnished, lighted
and comfortable interiors. These people were adept at camouflage
against air observation. Not only would their activity have been
unsuspected by an airship passing over the center of the
community, but even by an enemy who might happen to drop through
the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the forest. The
camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape and
of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were
hidden.</p>

<p>There were 724 dwellings or camps among the Wyomings, located
within an area of about fifteen square miles. The total
population was 8,688, every man, woman and child, whether member
or "exchange," being listed. The plants were widely scattered
through the territory also. Nowhere was anything like congestion
permitted. So far as possible, families and individuals were
assigned to living quarters, not too far from the plants or
offices in which their work lay.</p>

<p>All able-bodied men and women alternated in two week periods
between military and industrial service, except those who were
needed for household work. Since working conditions in the plants
and offices were ideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy
outdoor activity. In addition, the population was sturdy and
active. Laziness was regarded as nearly the greatest of social
offences.</p>

<p>Hard work and general merit were variously rewarded with extra
privileges, advancement to positions of authority, and with
various items of personal equipment for convenience and
luxury.</p>

<p>In leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside
the dwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten
other men, watching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely,
but swift movements, they swung up and down the forest trail,
rising from the ground in long almost-horizontal leaps,
occasionally swinging from one convenient branch over head to
another, "sliding" back to the ground farther on. Normal
traveling pace, where these trails were straight enough, was
about twenty miles an hour. Such things as automobiles and
railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a month old in
my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared with such
convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.</p>

<p>Bill suggested that I wander around for several days, from
plant to plant, to observe and study what I could. The entire
community had been apprised of my coming, my rating as an
"exchange" reaching every building and post in the community, by
means of ultronic broadcast Everywhere I was welcomed in an
interested and helpful spirit.</p>

<p>I visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated
from the ether and through slow processes built up into
subelectronic, electronic and atomic forms into the two great
synthetic elements, ultron and inertron. I learned something,
superficially at least, of the processes of combined chemical and
mechanical action through which were produced the various forms
of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture of the machines
which were used at locations of construction to produce the
various forms of building materials. But I was particularly
interested in the munitions plants and the rocket ship shops.</p>

<p>Ultron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate
elasticity, which has the property of being 100 percent
conductive to those pulsations known as light, electricity and
heat. Since it is completely permeable to light vibrations, it is
therefore absolutely invisible and non-reflective. Its magnetic
response is almost, but not quite, 100 percent also. It is
therefore very heavy under normal conditions but extremely
responsive to the repellor anti-gravity rays, such as the Hans
use as "legs" for their airships.</p>

<p>Inertron is the second great triumph of American research and
experimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few
years before my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a
synthetic element, built up, through a complicated heterodyning
of ultronic pulsations, from "infra balanced" subionic forms. It
is completely inert to both electric and magnetic forces in all
the orders above the ultronic; that is to say, the sub-
electronic, the electronic, the atomic and the molecular. In
consequence it has a number of amazing and valuable properties.
One of these is the total lack of weight. Another is a total lack
of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It reflects 100
percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does not feel
cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat
of the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure
despite its lack of weight, of great strength and considerable
elasticity. It is a perfect shield against the disintegrator
rays.</p>

<p>Rocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the
mechanism of launching the bullet is concerned. They are simple
light tubes, closed at the rear end with a trigger-actuated pin
for piercing the thin skin at the base of the cartridge. This
piercing of the skin starts the chemical and atomic reaction. The
entire cartridge leaves the tube under its own power, at a very
easy initial velocity, just enough to insure accuracy of aim; so
the tube does not have to be of heavy construction. The bullet
increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or explosive.
It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of these
two.</p>

<br>

<p>Bill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and
strategy. Strangely enough he had no idea whatever of the
possibilities of the barrage, though the tremendous effect of a
"curtain of fire" with such high-explosive projectiles as these
modern rocket guns used was obvious to me. But the barrage idea,
it seemed, had been lost track of completely in the air wars that
followed the First World War, and in the peculiar guerrilla
tactics developed by Americans in the later period of operations
from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars which
until a few generations ago, I learned, had been almost
continuous.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Bill one day, "if we couldn't work up some
form of barrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me
today that he's been in communication with the other gangs, and
all are agreed that the Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for
good. That attempt on Wilma Deering's life and their evident
desire to make trouble among the gangs, has stirred up every
community east of the Alleghanies. The Boss says that none of the
others will object if we go after them. Now show me again how you
worked that business in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought
to be pretty much the same."</p>

<p>I went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out
a modified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful
weapons, and the use of jumpers.</p>

<p>"It will be easy," Bill exulted. "I'll slide down and talk it
over with the Boss tomorrow."</p>

<p>During the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma
Deering and I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a
little closer friendship for her, in view of the fact that she
was the first human being I saw after waking from my long
sleep.</p>

<p>It was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual
interest in me. In the first place, I was her personal discovery,
and I had saved her life. In the second, she was a girl of
studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired of my
stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.</p>

<p>The others of the community, however, seemed to find our
friendship a bit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation
for being cold toward the opposite sex, and so others
misinterpreted her attitude, much to their own delight. Wilma and
I, however, ignored this as much as we could.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; A HAN AIR RAID</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a girl in Wilma's camp named Gerdi
Mann, with whom Bill Hearn was desperately in love, and the four
of us used to go around a lot together. Gerdi was a distinct
type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark brown hair and hazel eyes
that marked nearly every member of the country, Gerdi had red
hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She was a throwback in
physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I have
found very rare among modern Americans. The four of us were
engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I
obtained my first experience of a Han air raid.</p>

<p>We were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the
valley that teemed with human activity, invisible beneath its
blanket of foliage.</p>

<p>The other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and
indefinitely, as a race on the other side of the globe, which,
like ourselves, had succeeded in maintaining a precarious and
fugitive existence in rebellion against the Mongolian domination
of the earth, were listening with interest to my theory that
Gerdi's ancestors of several hundred years ago must have been
Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish type, and that her
surname might well have been McMann, or MeMahan, and still more
anciently "mac Mathghamhain." They were interested too in my
surmise that "Gerdi" was the same name as that which had been
"Gerty" or "Gertrude" in the 20th Century.</p>

<p>In the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm
rocket that burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a
pall of red smoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by
others at scattered points in the northern sky.</p>

<p>"A Han raid!" Bill exclaimed in amazement. "The first in seven
years!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it's just one of their ships off its course," I
ventured.</p>

<p>"No," said Wilma in some agitation. "That would be green
rockets. Red means only one thing, Tony. They're sweeping the
countryside with their dis beams. Can you see anything,
Bill?"</p>

<p>"We had better get under cover," Gerdi said nervously. "The
four of us are bunched here in the open. For all we know they may
be twelve miles up, out of sight, yet looking at us with a
projector."</p>

<p>Bill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with his glass, but
apparently saw nothing.</p>

<p>"We had better scatter, at that," he said finally. "It's
orders, you know. See!" He pointed to the valley.</p>

<p>Here and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the
foliage of the treetops.</p>

<p>"That's bad," Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. "No
less than fifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from
a central point. Do they want to give away our location?"</p>

<p>The standard orders covering air raids were that the
population was to scatter individually. There should be no
grouping, or even pairing, in view of the destructiveness of the
disintegrator rays. Experience of generations had proved that if
this were done, and everybody remained hidden beneath the tree
screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after mile of
territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage of
the community.</p>

<p>Gerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an
equal obstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at
this sort of thing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that
she was too; she was only thirteen or fourteen years old at the
time of the last air raid.</p>

<p>However, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped
together about a quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and
Gerdi disappeared down the hillside among the trees.</p>

<p>Wilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might
overlook the valley and the sky to the north, and we found it
near the top of the ridge, where, protected from visibility by
thick branches, we could look out between the tree trunks, and
get a good view of the valley.</p>

<p>No more rockets went up. Except for a few of those waning red
clouds, drifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible
indication of man's past or present existence anywhere in the sky
or on the ground.</p>

<p>Then Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in
the distance; looking like a phantom dirigible in its coat of
low-visibility paint.</p>

<p>"Seven thousand feet up," Wilma whispered, crouching close to
me. "Watch."</p>

<p>The ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of
the 20th Century that I had seen, but without the suspended
control car, engines, propellers; rudders or elevating planes. As
it loomed rapidly nearer, I saw that it was wider and somewhat
flatter than I had supposed.</p>

<img src="0601821h-images/Armageddon-04.gif"
style="float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>Now I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft,
like searchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight
(and still faintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually,
I had been informed by my instructors, there were two rays. The
visible one was generated by the ship's apparatus, and directed
toward the ground as a beam of "carrier" impulses. The true
repellor ray, the complement of the other in one sense, induced
by the action of the "carrier" reacted in a concentrating upward
direction from the mass of the earth. It became successively
electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its nature,
according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and
"carrier" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself
actually was supported on an upward rushing column of air, much
like a ball continuously supported on a fountain jet.</p>

<p>The raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both
slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with
tremendous momentum.</p>

<p>The ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in
a casual, intermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed
downward with blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground
melted instantaneously into nothing where they played upon
them.</p>

<p>When later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found
them some five feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed
surfaces being lava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent,
greenish hue.</p>

<p>No systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however,
until it reached a point over the center of the valley&mdash;the
center of the community's activities. There it came to a sudden
stop by shooting its repellor beams sharply forward and easing
them back gradually to the vertical, holding the ship floating
and motionless. Then the work of destruction began
systematically.</p>

<p>Back and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing
parallel furrows from hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay.
Wilma and I, as time after time we saw it plough through sections
where we knew camps or plants were located.</p>

<p>"This is awful," she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes.
"How could they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see?
They were never in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined
spot&mdash; and&mdash;and it was exactly the right spot."</p>

<p>We did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned
in our direction. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a
split second into mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely
enough, it was this self-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who
clung to me&mdash;a relatively primitive man of the 20th, less
familiar than she with the thought of this terrifying
possibility&mdash;for moral support.</p>

<p>We knew that many of our companions must have been whisked
into absolute non-existence before our eyes in these few moments.
The whole thing paralyzed us into mental and physical immobility
for I do not know how long.</p>

<p>It couldn't have been long, however, for the rays had not
ploughed more than thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so
across the valley, when I regained control of myself, and brought
Wilma to herself by shaking her roughly.</p>

<p>"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?" I demanded,
drawing my pistol.</p>

<p>"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the
longest range rocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a
longer tube. But why? You couldn't penetrate the shell of that
ship with rocket force, even if you could reach it."</p>

<p>I fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I
had an idea I wanted to try. With Wilma's help, I selected the
longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my
pistol.</p>

<p>"It won't carry seven thousand feet, Tony," Wilma objected.
But I took aim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my
mind. The supporting repellor ray, I had been told, became
molecular in character at what was called a logarithmic level of
five (below that it was a purely electronic "flow" or pulsation
between the source of the "carrier" and the average mass of the
earth).</p>

<p>Below that level, if I could project my explosive bullet into
this stream where it began to carry material substance upward,
might it not rise with the air column, gathering speed and
hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it through the
shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly excited,
too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.</p>

<p>Feverishly I looked around for some formation of branches
against which I could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most
carefully. At last I found one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk
of the ship far above us, aiming at the far side of it, at such
an angle as would, so far as I could estimate, bring my bullet
path through the forward repellor beam. At last the sights
wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the button
gently.</p>

<p>For a moment we gazed breathlessly.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed
like a pendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it
down!"</p>

<p>We had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and
we dropped it three times in our excitement in inserting it in my
gun. Then, forcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while
Wilma stuffed her little fist into her mouth to keep from
shrieking, I sighted carefully again and fired.</p>

<p>The elapsed time of the rocket's invisible flight seemed an
age.</p>

<p>Then we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but
actually it fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over
end, its disintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast,
wild arcs, and once cutting a gash through the forest less than
two hundred feet from where we stood.</p>

<p>The crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground
reverberated from the hills&mdash;the momentum of eighteen or
twenty thousand tons, in a sheer drop of seven thousand feet. A
mangled mass of metal, it buried itself in the ground, with
poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking, semi-molten field
of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.</p>

<p>The silence, the vacuity of the landscape was oppressive as
the last echoes died away.</p>

<p>Then far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly
above the foliage screen. And in the distance another, and
another.</p>

<p>In a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after
another the little red puffs became drifting clouds.</p>

<p>"Scatter! Scatter!" Wilma exclaimed. "In half an hour there'll
be an entire Han fleet here from Nu-Yok, and another from Bah-
Flo. They'll get this instantly on their recordographs and
location finders. They'll blast the whole valley and the country
for miles beyond. Come, Tony. There's no time for the gang to
rally. See the signals. We've got to jump. Oh, I'm so proud of
you!"</p>

<p>Over the ridge we went, in long leaps towards the east, the
country of the Delawares.</p>

<p>From time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of
them were the "red warnings," the "scatter" signals. But from
certain of the others, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets,
she gathered that whoever was in command (we did not know whether
the Boss was alive or not) was ordering an ultimate rally toward
the south, and so we changed our course.</p>

<p>It was a great pity. I thought, that the clan had not been
equipped throughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma
explained to me that not enough of these had been built for
distribution as yet, although general distribution had been
contemplated within a couple of months.</p>

<p>We traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to
put as much distance as possible between ourselves and the
valley.</p>

<p>When gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a
comfortable spot beneath the trees and consumed part of our
emergency rations. It was the first time I had tasted the
stuff&mdash; a highly nutritive synthetic substance called
"concentro," which was, however, a bit bitter and unpalatable.
But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.</p>

<p>Neither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired
and happy, so we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma
making some sleepy remark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as
though the matter were all settled, and my surprise at my own
instant acceptance of the idea, for I had not consciously thought
of her that way before. But we both fell asleep at once.</p>

<p>In the morning we found little time for love making. The
practical problem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the
Wyoming plan must be to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she
had her doubts about the wisdom of this plan. In my elation at my
success in bringing down the Han ship, and my newly-found
interest in my charming companion, I had forgotten the ominous
fact that the Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact
location of the Wyoming Works.</p>

<p>This meant, to Wilma's mind, either that the Hans had
perfected new instruments as yet unknown to us, or that
somewhere, among the Wyomings or some other nearby gang, there
were traitors. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids
would follow, and since the Susquannas had a highly developed
organization and more than usually productive plants, the next
raid might be expected to strike them.</p>

<p>But at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch
with the other fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of
muscles that were sore from the excessive leaping of the day
before, we continued on our way.</p>

<p>We traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-
colored rocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.</p>

<p>"Bear to the left, Tony," Wilma said, "and listen for the
whistle."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Haven't they given you the rocket code yet?" she replied.
"That's what the green, followed by yellow and purple means: to
concentrate five miles east of the rocket position. You know the
rocket position itself might draw a play of dis rays."</p>

<p>It did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the
indicated rallying, though we were now traveling beneath the
trees, with but an occasional leap to a top branch to see if any
more rocket smoke was floating above. And soon we heard a distant
whistle.</p>

<p>We found about half the gang already there, in a spot where
the trees met high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid
Bosses were busy reorganizing the remnants.</p>

<p>"You two stick close to me," he said, adding grimly, "I'm
going back to the valley at once with a hundred picked men, and
I'll need you."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; SETTING THE TRAP</h2>

<p class="first">INSIDE of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A
certain amount of caution was sacrificed for the sake of speed,
and the men leaped away either across the forest top, or over
open spaces of ground, but concentration was forbidden. The Big
Boss named the spot on the hillside as the rallying point.</p>

<p>"We'll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we
don't group," he declared, "at least until within five miles of
the rallying spot. From then on I want every man to disappear
from sight and to travel under cover. And keep your ultrophones
open, and turned on ten-four-seven-six."</p>

<p>Wilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear
Boss. It consisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case
of ammunition constructed of inertron, which made the load weigh
but a few ounces, and a short sword. This gear we strapped over
each other's shoulders, on top of our jumping belts. In addition,
we each received an ultrophone, and a light inertron blanket
rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by two or three in
diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and but it had
considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in its
composition.</p>

<p>"This looks like business," Wilma remarked to me with
sparkling eyes. (And I might mention a curious thing here. The
word "business" had survived from the 20th Century American
vocabulary, but not with any meaning of "industry" or "trade,"
for such things being purely community activities were spoken of
as "work" and "clearing." Business simply meant fighting, and
that was all.)</p>

<p>"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?" I asked
the Gear Boss.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "There was no time to gather anything. All this
stuff we cleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with
the Boss on the way down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange
it. But you two had better be moving. He's beckoning you
now."</p>

<p>Hart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As
soon as we did so, he leaped away, waving us to follow
closely.</p>

<p>He was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low
leaps up the banks of the stream, which followed a fairly
straight course at this point. By extending ourselves, however,
Wilma and I were able to catch up to him.</p>

<p>As we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined
to us, between the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of
action.</p>

<p>"We have to start the big business&mdash;unh&mdash;sooner or
later," he said. "And if&mdash;unh&mdash;the Hans have found any
way of locating our positions&mdash;unh&mdash;it's time to start
now, although the Council of Bosses&mdash;unh&mdash;had intended
waiting a few years until enough rocket ships have
been&mdash;unh&mdash;built. But no matter what the
sacrifice&mdash; unh&mdash;we can't afford to let them get us on
the run&mdash;unh&mdash;We'll set a trap for the yellow devils in
the&mdash;unh&mdash;valley if they come back for their
wreckage&mdash;unh&mdash;and if they don't, we'll go rocketing
for some of their liners&mdash;unh&mdash;on the Nu-yok, Glee-lan,
Sikaga course. We can use&mdash;unh&mdash;that idea of yours of
shooting up the repellor&mdash;unh&mdash;beams. Want you to give
us a demonstration."</p>

<p>With further admonition to follow him closely, he increased
his pace, and Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up
with him. It was only in ascending the slopes that my tougher
muscles over-balanced his greater skill, and I was able to set
the pace for him, as I had for Wilma.</p>

<p>We slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron
blankets, and were off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the
top of the ridge overlooking the valley which Wilma and I had
left.</p>

<p>The Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking
some fifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into
use, calling the roll and giving the men their instructions.</p>

<p>His first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs
into permanent position.</p>

<p>These ultrophones were quite different from the one used by
Wilma's companion scout the day I saved her from the attack of
the bandit gang. That one was contained entirely in a small
pocket case These, with which we were now equipped, consisted of
a pair of ear discs, each a separate and self-contained receiving
set They slipped into little pockets over our ears in the fabric
helmets we wore, and shut out virtually all extraneous sounds.
The chest discs were likewise self-contained sending sets,
strapped to the chest a few inches below the neck and actuated by
the vibrations from the vocal cords through the body tissues. The
total range of these sets was about eighteen miles. Reception was
remarkably clear, quite free from the static of 20th Century
radios, and of a strength in direct proportion to the distance of
the speaker.</p>

<p>The Boss' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut
in on any local conversations, which were indulged in, however,
with great restraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining
contacts.</p>

<p>I marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle
communication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more
ancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the
20th and 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in
efficiency. These modern Americans, for instance, knew little of
hand-to-hand fighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare.
And until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them,
apparently, had ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket
into a repellor beam and letting the beam itself hurl it upward
into the most vital part of the Han ship.</p>

<p>Hart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions
to the campmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed
the individuals.</p>

<p>In the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on
the hillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a
good view of the wreckage of the Han ship. But not a man had come
in view, so far as I could see, in the whole process.</p>

<p>The Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma
and I should investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in
the sky, we would leap for the hillsides.</p>

<p>I suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns
trained on an imaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied
himself with this after the three of us leaped down to the Han
ship, serving as a target himself, while he called on the men
individually to aim their pieces and lock them in position.</p>

<p>In the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did
not find much. Practically all of the instruments and machinery
had been twisted out of an recognizable shape, or utterly
destroyed by the ship's disintegrator rays which apparently had
continued to operate in the midst of its warped remains for some
moments after the crash.</p>

<p>It was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the
crew. But it had to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was
quite different from that of the Americans, and more like the
garb to which I had been accustomed in the earlier part of my
life. It was made of synthetic fabrics like silks, loose and
comfortable trousers of knee length, and sleeveless shirts.</p>

<p>No protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma
explained to me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with
splendid arrangements for ventilation and heating. These
arrangements of course were equally adequate in their airships.
The Hans, indeed, had quite a distaste for unshaded daylight,
since their lighting apparatus diffused a controlled amount of
ultraviolet rays, making the unmodified sunlight unnecessary for
health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did not have
the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts. Yet
in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weight
at all times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans.
They lived lives of physical inertia, having machinery of every
description for the performance of all labor, and convenient
conveyances for any movement of more than a few steps.</p>

<p>Even from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that
seats, chairs and couches played an extremely important part in
their scheme of existence.</p>

<p>But none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed have been
the bodies of men in good health, but muscularly much
underdeveloped. Wilma explained to me that they had mastered the
science of gland control, and of course dietetics, to the point
where men and women among them not uncommonly reached the age of
a hundred years with arteries and general health in splendid
condition.</p>

<p>I did not have time to study the ship and its contents as
carefully as I would have liked, however. Time pressed, and it
was our business to discover some clue to the deadly accuracy
with which the ship had spotted the Wyoming Works.</p>

<p>The Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring
barrage, when one of the scouts on an eminence to the north,
announced the approach of seven Han ships spread out in a great
semicircle.</p>

<p>Hart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise,
but Wilma and I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched
off our "speakers" for conversation between ourselves, and by the
time we discovered what had happened, the ships were clearly
visible, so fast were they approaching.</p>

<p>"Jump!" we heard the Boss order, "Deering to the north. Rogers
to the east."</p>

<p>But Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the
twisted plates of the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a
shelter.</p>

<p>"Too late, Boss," she said. "They'd see us. Besides I think
there's something here we ought to look at. It's probably their
magnetic graph."</p>

<p>"You're signing your death warrant," Hart warned.</p>

<p>"We'll risk it," said Wilma and I together.</p>

<p>"Good for you," replied the Boss. "Take command then, Rogers,
for the present. Do you all know his voice, boys?"</p>

<p>A chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some
fast thinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of
metal.</p>

<p>"Wilma, hunt for that record," I said, knowing that by the
simple process of talking I could keep the entire command
continuously informed as to the situation. "On the hillsides,
keep your guns trained on the circles and stand by. On the
hilltops, how many of you are there. Speak in rotation from Bald
Knob around to the east, north, west."</p>

<p>In turn the men called their names. There were twenty of
them.</p>

<p>I assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships,
numbering the latter from left to right.</p>

<p>"'Train our rockets on their repellor rays about three
quarters of the way up, between ships and ground. Aim is more
important than elevation. Follow those rays with your aim
continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not before. Deering has the
record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or at least think
there are but two of us in the valley, since they're settling
without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?"</p>

<p>My ear discs remained silent.</p>

<p>"Deering and I will remain here until they land and debark.
Stand by and keep alert."</p>

<p>Rapidly and easily, the largest of the Han ships settled to
the earth. Three scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher
level. The others floated motionless about thousand feet
above.</p>

<p>Peeping through a small fissure between two plates, we saw the
vast hulk of the ship come to rest full on the line of our
prospective ring barrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet
from the ground, and one by one the crew emerged.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE "WYOMING
MASSACRE"</h2>

<p class="first">"THEY'RE coming out of the ship." I spoke
quietly with my hand over my mouth, for fear they might hear me.
"One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine. That seems to be
all. Who knows how many men a ship like that is likely to
carry?"</p>

<p>"About ten, if there are no passengers," replied one of my
men, probably one of those on the hillside.</p>

<p>"How are they armed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Just knives," came the reply. "They never permit hand rays on
the ship. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it."</p>

<p>"Leave them to us then," I said, for I had a plan in mind.
"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring
target. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You on the
hilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south.
Shoot at the word, but not before.</p>

<p>"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight
leap for the door in that ship. These men are all walking around
the wreck in a bunch. When they're on the far side, I'll give the
word and you leap through that door in one bound. I'll follow.
Maybe we won't be seen. We'll overpower the guard inside, but
don't shoot. We may escape being seen by both this crew and the
ships above. They can't see over this wreck."</p>

<p>It was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans
who had emerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily,
talking in guttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but
quite unsuspicious.</p>

<p>At last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be
picking their way into the wreck.</p>

<p>"Wilma, leap!" I almost whispered the order.</p>

<p>The distance between Wilma's hiding place and the door in the
side of the Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was
already crouched with her feet braced against a metal beam.
Taking the lift of the inertron belt into her calculation, she
dove head foremost, like a projectile, through the door. I
followed in a split second, more clumsily, but no less speedily,
bruising my shoulder painfully as I ricocheted from the edge of
the opening and brought up sliding against the unconscious girl;
for she evidently had hit her head against the partition within
the ship into which she had crashed.</p>

<p>We had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps
were approaching down a well-lit gangway.</p>

<p>"Any signs we have been observed?" I asked my men on the
hillsides.</p>

<p>"Not yet," I heard the Boss reply. "Ships overhead still
standing. No beams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed
in wreck. Most of them have crawled into it out of sight."</p>

<p>"Good," I said quickly. "Deering hit her head. Knocked out.
One or more members of the crew approaching. We're not discovered
yet. I'll take care of them. Stand a bit longer, but be
ready."</p>

<p>I think my last words must have been heard by the man who was
approaching, for he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>I crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I
would not draw my sword if there were only one of them.</p>

<p>Apparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a
man came around a sort of bulkhead&mdash;and I leaped.</p>

<p>I swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him
full in the stomach and knocked him cold.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="0601821h-images/Armageddon-05.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>I ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the
control room. I found it well up in the nose of the ship. And it
was deserted. What could I do to jam the controls of the ship
that would not register on the recording instruments of the other
ships? I gazed at the mass of controls. Levers and wheels galore.
In the center of the compartment, on a massively braced universal
joint mounting, was what I took for the repellor generator. A
dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within its shielding
metallic case. But I had no time to study it.</p>

<p>Above all else, I was afraid that some automatic apparatus
existed in the room, through which I might be heard on the other
ships. The risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I
abandoned the idea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a
chance that there was no other member of the crew aboard.</p>

<p>I ran back to the entrance compartment. Wilma still lay where
she had slumped down. I heard the voices of the Hans approaching.
It was time to act. The next few seconds would tell whether the
ships in the air would try or be able to melt us into
nothingness.</p>

<p>"Are you boys all ready?" I asked, creeping to a position
opposite the door and drawing my handgun.</p>

<p>Again there was a chorus of assent.</p>

<p>"Then on the count of three, shoot up those rep rays&mdash;all
of them&mdash;and for God's sake, don't miss." I was beginning to
think in the terms the others used generally&mdash;"dis" for
disintegrator, "rep" for repellor. And I counted.</p>

<p>I think my "three" was a bit weak. I know it took all the
courage I had to utter it.</p>

<p>For an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the
landing party from the ship strolled into my range of vision.</p>

<p>Then, startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant
they stood frozen with horror at whatever they saw.</p>

<p>One hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple
of them made a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I
fired pointblank with my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as
I could and aiming at their feet to make sure my explosive
rockets would make contact and do their work.</p>

<p>The detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on
which the Hans stood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there
was nothing there except their torn and mutilated corpses. They
had been fairly bunched and I got them all.</p>

<p>I ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into
infinity by the sweep of a dis ray.</p>

<p>Some eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to the
earth. A dis ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly
for a moment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in
which I stood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light
switched off, it shot to one side, and a moment later another
vast hulk crashed to earth. I looked out, then stepped out on the
ground.</p>

<p>The only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the
south which were hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly
down. The others must have crashed down while I was deafened by
the sound of the explosion of my own rockets.</p>

<p>Somebody hit the other rep ray of one of the two remaining
ships and it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other,
farther away, drifted down diagonally, its dis ray playing
viciously over the ground below it.</p>

<p>I shouted with exultation and relief.</p>

<p>"Take back the command, Boss!" I yelled.</p>

<p>His commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending
ship, rang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped
back into the compartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my
Wilma. Her padded helmet had absorbed much of the blow, I
thought; otherwise, her skull might have been fractured.</p>

<p>"Oh, my head!" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently
in my arms and strode out in the open with her. "We must have
won, dearest, did we?"</p>

<p>"We most certainly did," I reassured her. "All but one crashed
and that one is drifting down toward the south. We've captured
this one we're in intact. There was only one member of the crew
aboard when we dove in."</p>

<p>Less than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to
tune in ultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated
broadcast of the Han intelligence office in Nu-Yok from the
Susquanna station. It was in the form of a public warning and
news item.</p>

<p>"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-Yok, broadcasting
warning to navigators of private ships, and news public interest.
The squadron of seven ships which left Nu-Yok this morning to
investigate the recent destruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming
Valley, has been destroyed by a series of mysterious explosions
similar to those which wrecked the GK-984."</p>

<p>"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of
five of the seven ships ceased operating suddenly at
approximately the same moment, about seven-four-nine." (According
to the Han system of reckoning time, seven and forty-nine one
hundredths after midnight.) "After violent disturbances, the
location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity registers
applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead."</p>

<p>"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of
disaster which overtook the squadron except certain evidences of
the explosive phenomena similar to those in he case of the GK-
984, which recently went dead while beaming the valley in a
systematic effort to wipe out the works and camps of the
tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the deduction that
the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet undetermined,
technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to the
Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority to be given
the Navigation Intelligence Division to make a investigation of
this technique and develop a defense against it.</p>

<p>"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this
territory in particular, and in general hold as closely as
possible to the official inter-city routes, which now are being
patrolled by the entire force of the Military Office, which is
beaming the routes generously to width of ten miles. The Military
office reports that it is at present considering no retaliatory
raids against the tribesmen. With the Navigation Intelligence
Division, it holds that unless further evidence of the nature of
the disaster is developed in the near future, the public interest
will be better served, and at smaller cost of life by a
scientific research than by attempts at retaliation which may
bring destruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless
further evidence is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the
contrary, the Military will hold to a defensive policy.</p>

<p>"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the
Heaven-Council has the matter under consideration.</p>

<p>"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of
the following condensation of its detailed observations.</p>

<p>"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley
where the wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of
its location finder before it went dead recently. There the
bottom projectoscope relays of all ships registered the wreck of
the GK-984 Teleprojectoscope views of the wreck and the bowl of
the valley showed no evidence of the presence of tribesmen.
Neither ship registers nor base registers showed any indication
of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On orders
from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-218, LK-745 and LG25
scouted southward at 8,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220
stood above at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit
personal inspection of the wreck by the science committee. The
party debarked, leaving one man on board in the control cabin. He
set all projectoscopes at universal focus except RB43," (this
meant the third projectoscope from the bow of the ship, on the
right hand side of the lower deck) "with which he followed the
landing group as it walked around the wreck.</p>

<p>"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the
instruments at Base was that relayed automatically from
projectoscope RB-4 of the GK-18, which as the party disappeared
from view in back of the wreck recorded two green missiles of
roughly Cylindrical shape, projected from the wreckage into the
landing compartment of the ship. At such close range these were
not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at which the
projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once ordered
the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave the
control room in compliance with this order. An instant later
confused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as
might be made by a man falling heavily, and footsteps approached
the control room, a figure entering and leaving the control room
hurriedly. The Base Captain now believes, and the stills of the
photorecord support his belief, that this was not the crew member
who had been left in the control room. Before the Base Captain
could speak to him he left the room, nor was any response given
to the attention signal the Captain flashed throughout the
ship.</p>

<p>"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship, now out of
focus control, dimly showed the landing party walking back toward
the ship. RBA showed it more clearly. Then on both these
instruments, a number of blinding explosives in rapid succession
were seen and the electrophone relays registered terrific
concussions; the ship's electronic apparatus and projectoscopes
apparatus went dead.</p>

<p>"Reports of the other ships' Base Observers and Executives,
backed by the photorecords, show the explosions as taking place
in the midst of the landing party as it returned, evidently
unsuspicious, to the ship. Then in rapid succession they indicate
that terrific explosions occurred inside and outside the three
ships standing above close to their rep ray generators, and all
signals from these ships thereupon went dead.</p>

<p>"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered
an identical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to
the knowledge of the disaster. But with LX-745 and the LG-25, it
was different.</p>

<p>"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction
by an explosion of the rear rep ray generator, and that the ship
hung stern down for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The
forward viewplates and indicators did not cease functioning, but
their records are chaotic, except for one projectoscope still,
which shows the bowl of the valley, and the GK-981 falling, but
no visible evidence of tribesmen. The control-room viewplate is
also a chaotic record of the ship's crew tumbling and falling to
the rear wall. Then the forward rep ray generator exploded, and
all signals went dead.</p>

<p>"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this
ship hung nose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it
slowly descended out of control."</p>

<p>"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its
Action Captain was precluded. The record of the interior rear
viewplates shows members of the crew climbing toward the rear rep
ray generator in an attempt to establish manual control of it,
and increase the lift. The projectoscope relays, swinging in wide
arcs, recorded little of value except at the ends of their
swings. One of these, from a machine which happened to be set in
telescopic focus, shows several views of great value, picturing
the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear projectoscope
records enable the reconstruction in detail of the pendulum and
torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the earth.
But none of the views showing the forest below contain any
indication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this
ship out of commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point
four miles S. by E. of the center of the valley."</p>

<p>The message ended with a repetition of the warning to other
airmen to avoid the valley.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; INCREDIBLE
TREASON</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER receiving this report, and reassurances of
support from the Big Bosses of the neighboring gangs, Hart
determined to reestablish the Wyoming Valley community.</p>

<p>A careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the
northern sections and slopes that had been "beamed" by the first
Han ship.</p>

<p>The synthetic fabrics plant had been partially wiped out,
though the lower levels underground had not been reached by the
dis ray. The forest screen above, however, had been annihilated,
and it was determined to abandon it after removing all usable
machinery and evidences of the processes that might be of
interest to the Han scientists, should they return to the valley
in the future.</p>

<p>The ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had
just been about to start operation at the time of the raid, were
intact, as were the other important plants.</p>

<p>Hart brought the Big Camboss up from the Swquanna Works, and
laid out new camp locations, scattering them farther to the
south, and avoiding ground which had been seared by the Han beams
and the immediate locations of the Han wrecks.</p>

<p>During this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages,
for the phone plant had been one of the first to be put in
operation, and when it became evident that the Hans did not
intend any immediate reprisals, the entire membership of the
community was summoned back, and normal life was resumed.</p>

<p>Wilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of
the ships, and spent this intervening period in a delightful
honeymoon, camping high in the mountains. On our return, we had a
camp of our own, of course. We were assigned to location 1017.
And as might be expected, we had a great deal of banter over
which one of us was Camp Boss. The title stood after my name on
the Big Boss' records, and those of the Big Camboss, of course,
but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at all&mdash;and
generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.</p>

<p>I found myself a full-fledged member of the gang now, for I
had elected to search no farther for a permanent alliance, much
as I would have liked to familiarize myself with this 25th
Century life in other sections of the country.</p>

<p>The Wyomings had a high morale, and had prospered under the
rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of the gangs, I
found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in authority,
and were rife with intrigue. Oh the whole, I thought I would be
wise to stay with a group which had already proved its
friendliness, and in which I seemed to have prospects of
advancement. Under these modern social and economic conditions,
the kind of individual freedom to which I had been accustomed in
the 20th Century was impossible. This entire modern life, it
appeared to me, judging from my ancient viewpoint, was organized
along what I called "political" lines. And in this connection, it
amused me to notice how universal had become the use of the word
"Boss." There was as little formality in his relations with his
followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century political
boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as well
as the same high consideration by him of their interest. He was
just as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the
general popularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his
autocracy.</p>

<p>The sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his
followers was as quickly deposed, either by them or by his
superiors, as the ancient ward leader of the 20th Century who
lost control of his votes.</p>

<p>As society was organized in the 20th Century, I did not
believe the system could work in anything but politics. I tremble
to think what would have happened, had the attempt been made to
handle the A.E.F. during the First World War, instead of by that
rigid military discipline and complete assumption of the
individual as a mere standardized cog in the machine.</p>

<p>But owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people
had endured at the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of
self-sacrifice and consideration for the common good that made
the scheme applicable and efficient in all forms of human co-
operation.</p>

<p>I have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates
regard the thought with as much horror as many worthy people of
the 20th Century felt in regard to any heretical suggestion that
the original outline of government as laid down in the First
Constitution did not apply as well to 20th Century conditions as
to those of the early 19th.</p>

<p>In later years I felt that there was a certain softening of
moral fiber among the people, since the Hans had been finally
destroyed with all their works; and Americans have developed a
new luxury economy. I have seen signs of the reawakening of
greed, of selfishness. The eternal cycle seems to be at work. I
fear that slowly, though surely, private wealth is reappearing,
codes of inflexibility are developing; they will be followed by
corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic event
will end this era and usher in a new one.</p>

<p>All this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which
concerns our early battles against the Hans, and not our more
modern problems of self-control.</p>

<p>Our victory over the seven Han ships had set the country
ablaze. The secret had been carefully communicated to the other
gangs, and the country was agog from one end to the other. There
was feverish activity in the ammunition plants, and the hunting
of stray Han ships became an enthusiastic sport. The results were
disastrous to our hereditary enemies.</p>

<p>From the Pacific Coast came the report of a great Transpacific
liner of 75,000 tons' lift being brought to earth from a position
of invisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught
the hazy outlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in
the twilight, like ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They
had fired rockets into it with ease, whereas they would have had
difficulty in hitting it if it had been moving at right angles to
their position. They got one rep ray. The other was not strong
enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose down, and since
it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in shooting
it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers.</p>

<p>From the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of
a Nu-Yok-A-lan-a liner. The sand-snipers, practically invisible
in their sand colored clothing, and half buried along the
beaches, lay in wait for days, risking the play of dis beams
along the route, and finally registering four hits within a week.
The Hans discontinued their service along this route, and as
evidence that they were badly shaken by our success, sent no
raiders down the Beaches.</p>

<p>It was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.</p>

<p>"Tony," he said, "there are two things I want to talk to you
about. One of them will become public property in a few days, I
think. We aren't going to get any more Han ships by shooting up
their rep rays unless we use much larger rockets. They are wise
to us now. They're putting armor of great thickness in the hulls
of their ships below the rep ray machines. Near Bah-Flo this
morning a party of Eries shot one without success. The explosions
staggered her, but did not penetrate. As near as we can gather
from their reports, their laboratories have developed a new alloy
of great tensile strength and elasticity which nevertheless lets
the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports indicate that the
Eries' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the party was
wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.</p>

<p>"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs
before long. The Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone
council. It was decided that America must organize on a national
basis. The first move is to develop sectional organization by
Zones. I have been made Superboss of the Midatlantic Zone.</p>

<p>"We're in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal
expeditions, and we've got to keep them away from our camps and
plants. I'm thinking of developing a permanent field force, along
the lines of the regular armies of the 20th Century you told me
about. Its business will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much
as possible to the Hans and to serve as a decoy, to keep their
attention from our plants. I'm going to need your help in
this.</p>

<p>"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this:</p>

<p>"Amazing and impossible as it seems, there is a group, or
perhaps an entire gang, somewhere among us, that is betraying us
to the Hans. It may be the Bad Bloods, or it may be one of those
gangs who live near one of the Han cities. You know, a hundred
and fifteen or twenty years ago there were certain of these
people's ancestors who mated with the Hans, sometimes serving
them as slaves, in the days before they brought all their service
machinery to perfection.</p>

<p>"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and
another in Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly
suspect the Pineys. There is little intelligence among them. They
wouldn't have the information to give the Hans, nor would they be
capable of imparting it. They're absolute savages."</p>

<p>"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing
information to the Hans?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "first of all there was that raid upon us.
That first Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You
remember it floated directly into position above the valley and
began a systematic beaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have
learned that we are picking up their electrophone waves, for
they've gone back to their old, but extremely accurate, system of
directional control. But we've been getting them for the past
week by installing automatic rebroadcast units along the scar
paths. This is what we call those strips of country directly
under the regular ship routes of the Hans, who as a matter of
precaution frequently blast them with their dis beams to prevent
the growth of foliage which might give shelter to us. But they've
been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as though they even
had information of this strategy. And in addition, they've been
using code. Finally, we've picked up three of their messages in
which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of our
'mysterious' ultrophone."</p>

<p>"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of
ultronic activity?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," said the Big Boss thoughtfully, "they don't seem to have
a bit of information about it."</p>

<p>"Then it's quite clear," I ventured, "that whoever is
'clearing' us to them is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit
of occasional barter, rather than an out and out alliance.
They're holding back as much information as possible for future
bartering, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Yes," Hart said, "and it isn't information the Hans are
giving in return, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick
would be to locate the goods. I guess I'll have to make a
personal trip around among the Big Bosses."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE HAN CITY</h2>

<p class="first">THIS conversation set me thinking. All of the
Han electrophone inter-communication had been an open record to
the Americans for a good many years, and the Hans were just
finding it out. For centuries they had not regarded us as any
sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never occurred to them to
secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-Yok or Bah-Flo, or
possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous
transaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only
get at it! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.</p>

<p>David Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and
his experts. There ensued several days of research, in which the
Han records of the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In
the end they picked out a mass of detail, and fitted it together
into a very definite picture of the great central filing office
of the Hans in Nu-Yok, where the entire mass of official records
was kept, constantly available for instant projectoscoping to any
of the city's offices, and of the system by which the information
was filed.</p>

<p>The attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly
turned the idea down when I first presented it to him. It was
unthinkable, he said. Sheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded
him.</p>

<p>"I will need," I said, "Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with
the Han library system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized
on their military offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and
the best swooper pilot we have." Swoopers are one-man and two-man
ships, developed by the Americans, with skeleton backbones of
inertron (during the war painted green for invisibility against
the green forests below) and "bellies" of clear ultron.</p>

<p>"That will be Mort Gibbons," said Hart; "We've only got three
swoopers left, Tony, but I'll risk one of them if you and the
others will voluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won't
urge or order one of you to go. I'll spread the word to every
Plant Boss at once to give you anything and everything you need
in the way of equipment."</p>

<p>When I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent
and tearful objections, but she didn't. She was made of far
sterner stuff than the women of the 20th Century. Not that she
couldn't weep as copiously or be just as whimsical on occasion;
but she wouldn't weep for the same reasons.</p>

<p>She just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed
to be a bit of pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I
confess I was somewhat disappointed that she could so
courageously risk my loss.</p>

<p>We were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had
kissed Wilma goodbye at our camp, and after a final conference
over our plans, we boarded our craft and gently glided away over
the treetops on a course, which, after crossing three routes of
the Han ships, would take us out over the Atlantic, off the
Jersey coast, whence we would come up on Nu-Yok from the
ocean.</p>

<p>Twice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground
near a route while Han ships passed. Those were tense moments.
Had the green back of our ship been observed, we would have been
disintegrated in a second. But it wasn't.</p>

<p>Once over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral,
ten miles in diameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles.
Here Gibbons shut off his rocket motor, and we floated far above
the level of the Atlantic liners, whose course was well to the
north of us anyhow, and waited for nightfall.</p>

<p>Then Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at
me.</p>

<p>"I have a surprise for you, Tony," he said throwing back the
lid of what I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh
of relief, Wilma stepped out of the case.</p>

<p>"If you go into zero" (a common expression of the day for
being annihilated by the disintegrator ray), "you don't think I'm
going to let you go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn't believe my
ears last night when you spoke of going without me, until I
realized that you are still five hundred years behind the times
in lots of ways. Don't you know, dear heart, that you offered me
the greatest insult a husband could give a wife? You didn't, of
course."</p>

<p>The others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret. At
nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city.
This took some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker,
who explained to me that he had to determine our point by
ultronic bearings. The slightest resort to an electronic
instrument, he feared, might be detected by our enemies'
locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our swooper any lower
than five miles for fear that its capacity might be reflected in
their instruments.</p>

<p>Finally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central
tower of the city.</p>

<p>"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off," he remarked
with confidence, "I'll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you,
Mort. See what you can do to hold her steady. No&mdash;here,
watch this indicator&mdash;the red beam, not the green one.
See&mdash;if you keep it exactly centered on the needle, you're
O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The tower
platform is fifty feet square, so we've got a good margin to work
on."</p>

<p>For several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his
levers, constantly adjusting them with deft touches of his
fingers. After a bit of wavering, the beam remained centered on
the needle.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "let's drop."</p>

<p>I opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again
when I felt the air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied
atmosphere in a torrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from
his instrument board.</p>

<p>"I forgot," I mumbled. "Silly of me. Of course, we'll have to
drop out of compartment."</p>

<p>The compartment to which I referred, was similar to those in
some of the 20th Century submarines. We all entered it There was
barely room for us to stand shoulder to shoulder. With some
struggles, we got into our special air helmets and adjusted the
pressure. At our signal, Gibbons exhausted the air in the
compartment, pumping it into the body of the ship, and as the
little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open the hatch.</p>

<p>Setting the ultron wire reel, I climbed through, and began to
slide down gently.</p>

<p>We all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight
balance of but a few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron
wire that was to be our guide was of gossamer fineness, though,
anyway, I believe it would have lifted the full weight of the
five of us, so strong and tough was this invisible metal. As an
extra precaution, since the wire was of the purest metal, and
therefore totally invisible, even in daylight, we all had our
belts hooked on small rings that slid down the wire.</p>

<p>I went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few
feet above me, then Barker, Blash, and Gaunt. Gibbons, of course,
stayed behind to hold the ship in position and control the paying
out of the line. We all had our ultrophones in place inside our
air helmets, and so could converse with one another and with
Gibbons. But at Wilma's suggestion, although we would have liked
to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them adjusted to short-
range work, for fear that those who had been clearing with the
Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might also
pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear
us. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we
landed, we could converse freely without danger of their hearing
our voices through our air helmets.</p>

<p>For a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then
I realized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything,
that we were sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two
more cloud layers before anything was visible to us.</p>

<p>Then there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of
the most beautiful sights I have even seen: the soft, yet
brilliant, radiance of the great Han city of Nu-Yok. Every foot
of its structural members seemed to glow with a wonderful
incandescence, tower piled upon tower, and all built on the vast
base-mass of the city, which, so I had been told, sheered upward
from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728 levels.</p>

<p>The city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything
like the same area as the New York of the 20th Century. It
occupied, as a matter of fact, only the lower half of Manhattan
Island, with one section straddling the East River and spreading
out sufficiently over what once had been Brooklyn, to provide
berths for the great liners and other aircraft.</p>

<p>Straight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the
only spot in the entire city that was not aflame with radiance.
This was the central tower, in the top floors of which were
housed the vast library of record files and the main
projectoscope plant.</p>

<p>"You can shoot the wire now," I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let
go the little weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we
followed with considerable speed, but braking our descent with
gloved hands sufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a
faint light glowed as a signal for ourselves, might be observed
by any Han guard or night prowler. Apparently it was not, and we
again shot down with accelerated speed.</p>

<p>We landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and
fortunately for our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing
above it on which it would have been worth while to shed
illumination, or from which there was any need to observe it, the
Hans had neglected to light the tower roof, or indeed to occupy
it at all. This was the reason we had selected it as our landing
place.</p>

<p>As soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob
light, and the knob, as well as the wire, became totally
invisible. At our ultrophoned word, he would light it again.</p>

<p>"No gun play now," I warned. "Swords only, and then only if
absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>Closely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-
belted people could, we made our way cautiously through a door
and down an inclined plane to the floor below, where Gaunt and
Blash assured us the military offices were located.</p>

<p>Twice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in
front of mirror-like "windows" in the passage wall, and
flattening ourselves to the floor, we crawled past them.</p>

<p>"Projectoscopes," he said. "Probably on auto record only, at
this time of night. Still, we don't want leave any records for
them to study after we're gone."</p>

<p>"Were you ever here before?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "But I haven't been studying their
electrophone communications for seven years without being able to
recognize these machines when I run across them."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE FIGHT IN THE
TOWER</h2>

<p class="first">SO far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower
seemed deserted. Blash and Gaunt, however, assured me that there
would be at least one man on "duty" in the military offices,
though he would probably be asleep, and two or three in the
library proper and the projectoscope plant. "We've got to put
them out of commission," I said. "Did you bring the 'dope' cans,
Wilma?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "two for each. Here," and she distributed
them.</p>

<p>We were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where
we were to separate.</p>

<p>I did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was
necessary.</p>

<p>According to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the
projectoscope plant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and
Gaunt to the military office.</p>

<p>Blash and I traversed a long corridor, and I paused at the
great arched doorway of the library. Cautiously peered in. Seated
at three great switchboards were library operatives. Occasionally
one of them would reach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a
button, as little numbered lights winked on and off. They were
answering calls for electrograph and viewplate records on all
sorts of subjects from all sections of the city.</p>

<p>I apprised my companions of the situation.</p>

<p>"Better wait a bit," Blash added. "The calls will lessen
shortly."</p>

<p>Wilma reported an officer in the military office sound
asleep.</p>

<p>"Give him the can, then," I said.</p>

<p>Barker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the
projectoscope plant, and a few moments later he reported himself
well concealed, with a splendid view of the floor.</p>

<p>"I think we can take a chance now," Blash said to me, and at
my nod, he opened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes
did not affect us through our helmets. They were absolutely
without odor or visibility, and in a few seconds the librarians
were unconscious. We stepped into the room.</p>

<p>There ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment
on the part of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash
in the library; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply
attuned microphones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled
nearby corridors.</p>

<p>"I hear something approaching," Wilma said after a bit, with
excitement in her voice. "It's a soft, gliding sound."</p>

<p>"'That's an elevator somewhere," Barker cut in from the
projectoscope floor. "Can you locate it? I can't hear it."</p>

<p>"It's to the east of me," she replied.</p>

<p>"And to my west," said I, faintly catching it. "It's between
us, Wilma, and nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any
information yet, Blash&mdash;Gaunt?"</p>

<p>"Getting it now," one of them replied. "Give us two minutes
more."</p>

<p>"Keep at it then," I said. "We'll guard."</p>

<p>The soft, gliding sound ceased.</p>

<p>"I think it's very close to me," Wilma almost whispered. "Come
closer, Tony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I've
never known my nerves to get taut like this without reason."</p>

<p>In some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in great
leap toward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.</p>

<p>In the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of
alarm. The next instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to
see Wilma backing toward the door of the military office, her
sword red with blood, and an inert form on the corridor floor.
Two other Hans were circling to either side of her with wicked-
looking knives, while a third, evidently a high officer judging
by the resplendence of his garb, tugged desperately to get an
electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave
the alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us. I was at
least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with every
bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that
I dived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to
draw my legs beneath me.</p>

<p>Some instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as
I hurtled close to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the
floor, and had stiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or
foot might just prevent my reaching him. I brought my blade
upward and over.</p>

<p>It was a vicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from
groin to chin, and his body toppled down on me as I slid to a
tangled stop.</p>

<p>The other two, startled, turned. Wilma leaped at once and
struck him down with a side slash. I looked up at this instant,
and the dazed fear on his face at the length of her leap,
registered vividly. The Hans knew nothing of our inertron belts,
it seemed, and these leaps and dives of ours filled them with
terror.</p>

<p>As I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and
speed which I found time to admire even in this crisis, again
leaped. This time she dove head first as I had done, and with a
beautifully executed thrust, ran the last Han through the
throat.</p>

<p>Uncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and
then sank gently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that
they had the record we wanted.</p>

<p>"Back to the room, everybody!" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up
in my arms. With her inertron belt, she felt light as a
feather.</p>

<p>Gaunt joined me at once from the military office and at the
intersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us.
Barker, however, was not in evidence.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Barker?" I called.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," he replied. "I'll be with you on the roof at
once."</p>

<p>We came out in the open without any further mishap and I
instructed Gibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of
the ultron wire. It flashed dully a few feet away from us. Just
how he had maneuvered the ship to keep our end of the line in
position, without its swinging in a tremendous arc, I have never
been able to understand. Had not the night been an unusually
still one, he could not have checked the initial pendulum-like
movements. As it was, there was considerable air current at
certain of the levels, and in different directions too, But
Gibbons was an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the
handling of a rocket-ship, and he managed, with the aid of his
delicate instruments, to sense the drifts almost before they
affected the fine ultron wire, and to neutralize them with little
shifts in the position of the ship.</p>

<p>Blash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked
my own and Wilma's on, too. But on looking around, I found that
Barker was still missing.</p>

<p>"Barker, come!" I called. "We're waiting."</p>

<p>"Coming!" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure
appeared up the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the
wire and said something about a little surprise he had left for
the Hans.</p>

<p>"Don't reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet," I
instructed Gibbons. "It will take too long to wind it in. We'll
float up, and when we're aboard, we can drop it."</p>

<p>In order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two
of weight apiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off
our shoes as Gibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting
go of the wire, began to hum upward on our rings with increasing
velocity.</p>

<p>The rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to
her that we had been successful. Receding far below us now, I
could see our dully shining knob swinging to and fro in an ever-
widening arc, as it crossed and recrossed the black square of the
tower roof. As an extra precaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off
the light, and to show one from the belly of the ship, for so
great was our speed now, that I began to fear we would have
difficulty in checking ourselves. We were literally falling
upward, and with terrific acceleration.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this
difficulty, which none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It
was Gibbons who found the answer.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I
give the word," he said. "First I'll start reeling it in at full
speed. You won't get much of a jar, and then I'll decrease its
speed again gradually, and its weight will hold you back. Are you
ready? One-two-three!"</p>

<p>We all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the
word. We must have been rising a good bit faster than he figured,
however, for it wrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver
set up a sickening pendulum motion.</p>

<p>For a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may
have been a quarter of a mile across, about three and a half
miles above the city, and still more than a mile from our
ship.</p>

<p>Gibbons skillfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up
the line. Then at last we had ourselves under control again, and
continued our upward journey, checking our speed somewhat with
our gloves.</p>

<p>There was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of
relief when we scrambled through the hatch safely into the ship
again, cast off the ultron line and slammed the trap shut.</p>

<p>Little realizing that we had a still more terrible experience
to go through, we discussed the information that Blash and Gaunt
had between them extracted from the Han records, and the
advisability of ultrophoning Hart at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE WALLS OF HELL</h2>

<p class="first">THE traitors were, it seemed, a gang located a
few miles north of Nu-Yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the
Sinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in
return for several old rep ray machines, and the privilege of
tuning in on the Han electronic power broadcast for their
operation, provided their ships agreed to subject themselves to
the orders of the Han traffic office, while aloft.</p>

<p>The rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there
was always danger that we might never get back to the gang with
it.</p>

<p>I objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up
our message. Even if we used the directional projector, they
might have scouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang
stretches of country. They would flee to Nu-Yok and escape the
punishment they merited. It seemed to be vitally important that
that should not, for the sake of example to other weak groups
among the gangs, as well as to prevent a crisis in they might
clear more vital information to the enemy.</p>

<p>"Out to sea again," I ordered Gibbons. "They'll be less likely
to look for us in that direction."</p>

<p>"Easy, Boss, easy," he replied. "Wait until we get up a mile
or two more. They must have discovered evidence of our raid by
now, and their dis ray wall may go in operation any moment."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one
side.</p>

<p>"There it is!" he shouted. "Hang on, everybody, We're going to
nose straight up!" And he flipped the rocket motor control wide
open.</p>

<p>Looking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous,
luminous ring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint
iridescence.</p>

<p>We were almost over the destructive range of the dis ray wall,
a hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid
ring of generators surrounding the city. It was the main defense
system of the Hans, which had never been used except in periodic
tests. They may or may not have suspected that an American
rocket-ship was within the cylinder; probably they had turned on
their generators more as a precaution to prevent any reaching a
position above the city.</p>

<p>But even at our present great height, we were in great danger.
It was a question how much we might have been harmed by the rays
themselves, for their effective range was not much more than
seven or eight miles. The greater danger lay in the terrific
downward rush of air within the cylinder to replace that which
was being burned into nothingness by the continual play of the
disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder with the force of
a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the outside with
terrific force also, but naturally, the effect was intensified on
the interior.</p>

<p>Our ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of
escape&mdash;to fight our way well above the current. To drift
down with it meant ultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into
the annihilating wall at some lower level.</p>

<p>But very gradually and perkily our upward movement, as shown
on the indicators, began to increase; and after an hour of
desperate struggle we were free of the maelstrom and into the
rarefied upper levels. The terror beneath us was now invisible
through several layers of cloud formations.</p>

<p>Gibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her
eastward into one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I
have ever seen.</p>

<p>We described a great circle to the south and west, in a long
easy dive, for he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as
much as possible. We had drawn terrifically on their fuel
reserves in our battle with the elements. For the moment, the
atmosphere below cleared, and we could see the Jersey coast far
beneath, like a great map.</p>

<p>"We're not through yet," remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing
at his periscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. "A Han
ship, and a 'drop ship' at that&mdash;and he's seen us. If he
whips that beam of his on us, we're done."</p>

<p>I gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-
shaped ship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the
proportional size of its ports, of about the same size as our
swoopers. We learned later that they carried crews, for the most
part of not more than three or four men. They had streamlined
hulls and tails that embodied universal-jointed double fish-tail
rudders. In operation they rose to great heights on their
powerful rep rays, then gathered speed either by a straight nose
dive, or an inclined dive in which they sometimes used the rep
ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already above us, though
several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to get on
our tail and spear us with his beam as he dropped at us from a
great height.</p>

<p>Suddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping
downward slowly to our right. He went through a peculiar
corkscrew-like evolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam
to bear on us with a spiral motion.</p>

<p>Gibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions
that must have looked like those of a frightened hen.
Alternately, he used the forward and the reverse rocket blasts,
and in varying degree. We fluttered, we shot suddenly to right
and left, and dropped like a plummet in uncertain movements. But
all the time the Han scout dropped toward us, determinedly
whipping the air around us with his beam. Once it sliced across
beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we dropped with a
jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.</p>

<p>He had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the
speed of a projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it
was sheer luck. Maybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky
that way.</p>

<p>In the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with
the Han ship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and
its beam slowly slicing toward us in what looked like certain
destruction within the second, I saw Gibbons' fingers flick at
the lever of his rocket gun and a split second later the Han ship
flew apart like a clay pigeon.</p>

<p>We staggered, fluttered crazily for several moments while
Gibbons struggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section
of about four square feet in the side of the ship near the stern
slowly crumbled like rusted metal. His beam actually had touched
us, but our explosive rocket had got him a thousandth of a second
sooner.</p>

<p>Part of our rudder had been annihilated, and our motor
damaged. But we were able to swoop gently back across Jersey,
fortunately crossing the ship lanes without sighting any more Han
craft, and finally settling to rest in the little glade beneath
the trees, near Hart's camp.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE NEW BOSS</h2>

<p class="first">WE had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss
himself, surrounded by the Council, was on hand to welcome us and
learn our news. In turn we were informed that during the night a
band of raiding Bad Bloods, disguised under the insignia of the
Altoonas, a gang some distance to the west of us&mdash;had
destroyed several of our camps before our people had rallied and
driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to embroil us
with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges
recognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.</p>

<p>The Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the gang,
and was on the point of heading an expedition for the
extermination of the Bad Bloods.</p>

<p>I looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and
realized that the fate of America, at this moment, lay in their
hands. Their temper demanded the immediate expenditure of our
full effort in revenging ourselves for raid. But the strategic
exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly demanded the instant and
absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It might be only a matter
of hours, for all we knew, before they would barter clues to the
America nultronic secrets to the Hans.</p>

<p>"How large a force have we?" I asked Hart.</p>

<p>"Every man and maid who can be spared," he replied.</p>

<p>"That gives us seven hundred married and unmarried men, and
three hundred girls, more than the entire Bad Blood Gang.
Everyone is equipped with belts, ultrophones, rocket guns and
swords, and all fighting mad."</p>

<p>I meditated how I might put the matter to these determined
men.</p>

<p>Finally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just
what I said. I talked calmly, with due regard over the
information we had collected, point by point, building my case
logically, and painting a lurid picture of the danger impending
in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans of Nu-
Yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to
proceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race,
"if the Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of
the hopes of all America."</p>

<p>As I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached.
But it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly
than I did. He arose from the tree trunk on which he had been
sitting.</p>

<p>"That settles it," he said, looking around the ring. "I have
felt this thing coming on for some time now. I'm sure the Council
agrees with me that there is among us a man more capable than I
to boss the Wyoming Gang, despite his having had all too short a
time in which to familiarize himself with our modern ways and
facilities. Whatever I can do to support his effective
leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself to do."</p>

<p>As he concluded, he advanced to where I stood and taking from
his head the green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of
office, to my surprise he placed it in my mechanically extended
hand.</p>

<p>The roar of approval that went up from the Council members
left me dazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the
gang, and even though the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I
could hear the cheers with which my invisible followers greeted
me, from near and distant hillsides, camps and plants. My first
move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating this
news to the members of the gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor
mentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to
the Sinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, so
I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed
it to be believed that we were about to take to the air and the
trees against the Bad Bloods.</p>

<p>That outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were
"burning" the ether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the
benefit of the more distant gangs. It was their old game, these
appeals to the spirit of brotherhood, addressed to gangs too far
away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen
to our lot.</p>

<p>I chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my
plans. Were we actually to undertake the extermination of the Bad
Bloods at once it would have been a hard job to convince some of
the gangs that we had not been precipitate and unjustified.</p>

<p>But the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing.
In the first place, there would be no warning of our action until
it was all over, I hoped. In the second place, we would have
indisputable proof, in the form of their rep ray ships and other
paraphernalia, of their traffic with the Hans; and the state of
American bias, at the time of which I write, held trafficking
with the Hans a far more heinous thing than the most vicious gang
feud.</p>

<p>I called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted
to inventory our military resources.</p>

<p>I created a new office on the spot, that of "Control Boss,"
and appointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former
responsibility as Plant Boss to his assistant. I needed someone,
I felt, to tie in the records of the various functional
activities of the campaign, and take over from me the task of
keeping the records of them up to the minute.</p>

<p>I received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and
those of food, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry,
electronic activity and electrophone intelligence, ultroscopes,
air patrol and contact guard.</p>

<p>My ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged
with my 20th Century experience, and I found myself faced with
the task of working out a staff organization that was a composite
of the best and most easily applied principles of business and
military efficiency, as I knew them from the viewpoint of
immediate practicality.</p>

<p>What I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,
functionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of
intelligence as to the Sinsing activities; intelligence as to
Hans activities; perfection of communication with my own units;
co-operation of field command; and perfect mobilization of
emergency supplies and resources.</p>

<p>It took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out
the plan. First we assigned functional experts and equipment to
each "Division" in accordance with their needs. Then these in
turn were reassigned by the new Division Bosses to the Field
Commands as needed, or as Independent or Headquarters Units. The
two intelligence divisions were named A and M, "A" indicating
that one specialized in the American enemy and the other in the
Mongolians.</p>

<p>The division in charge of our own communications, the
assignment of ultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the
maintenance of operators and equipment, I called
"Communications."</p>

<p>I named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the
main or undetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division,
I assigned all responsibility for what few aircraft we had; and
all transportation and supply problems, I assigned to
"Resources." The functional bosses stayed with this division.</p>

<p>We finally completed our organization with the assignment of
liaison representatives among the various divisions as
needed.</p>

<p>Thus I had a "Headquarters Staff" composed of the Division
Bosses who reported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to
Wilma as my personal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses
had a small staff of his own.</p>

<p>In the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I
found we had roughly a thousand "troops," of whom some three
hundred and fifty were in what I called the Service Divisions,
the rest being in Bill Hearn's Field Division. This latter
number, however, was cut down somewhat by the assignment of
numerous small units to detached service. Altogether, the actual
available fighting force, I figured, would number about five
hundred by the time we actually went into action.</p>

<p>We had only six small swoopers, but I had a plan in mind, as
the result of our little raid on Nu-Yok, that would make this
sufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger
than I expected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing
its supply cases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of
inertron, was able to reduce each to a weight of a few ounces.
These easily could be floated and towed by the swoopers in
quantity. Hitched to ultron lines, it would be a virtually
impossibility for them to break loose.</p>

<p>The entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers,
and if each man and girl was careful to adjust balances properly,
the entire number could also be towed along through the air,
grasping wires of ultron, swinging below the swoopers, or
stringing out behind them.</p>

<p>There would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain
would be no greater than that of carrying a one two-pound weight
in the hand, except for air friction at high speeds. But to make
doubly sure that we should lose none of our personnel, I gave
strict orders that the belts and tow lines should be equipped
with rings and hooks. So great was the efficiency of the
fundamental organization and discipline of the gang, that we got
under way at nightfall.</p>

<p>One by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by
its long train or "kite-tail" of humanity and supply cases
hanging lightly from its tow line. For convenience, the tow lines
were made of an alloy of ultron which, unlike the metal itself,
is visible.</p>

<p>At first these "tails" hung downward, but as the ships swung
into formation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood
territory, gathering speed, they began to string out behind. And
swinging low from each ship on heavily weighted lines,
ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision observers keenly
scanned the countryside, while Intelligence men in the swoopers
above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.</p>

<p>Leaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of
affairs, Wilma and I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and
slid down about halfway to the under lookout&mdash;that is to
say, about a thousand feet. The sensation of floating swiftly
through the air like this, in the absolute security of one's
confidence in the inertron belt, was one of never-ending delight
to me.</p>

<p>We reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached
the territory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations
for the bombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry
out the attack as originally planned.</p>

<p>About fifteen miles from their camps, our ships came to a halt
and maintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts
of their rocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance
to make a thorough examination of the territory below us. It was
vital that this next step in our program should be carried out
with all secrecy.</p>

<p>At length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of
any appearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range
specialists was lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with
special automatic devices that the Resources Division had
developed at my request a few hours before our departure. These
were aiming and timing devices. After calculating the range,
elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns were left,
concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the ship
again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns
would begin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods' hillsides,
shifting their aim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did
many of our artillery pieces in the First World War.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles and
grounded, waiting for the bombardment to begin before we
attempted to sneak across the Han ship lane. I was relying for
security on the distraction that the bombardment might furnish
the Han observers.</p>

<p>It was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as
planned, our squadron drifting across the route high enough to
enable the ships' tails of troops and supply cases to clear the
ground.</p>

<p>In crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of
Jersey, we were not so successful in escaping observation. A Han
ship came speeding along at a very low elevation. We caught it on
our electronic location and direction finders, and also located
it with our ultrascopes, but it came so fast and so low that I
thought it best to remain where we had grounded the second and
lie quiet, rather than get under way and cross in front of
it.</p>

<p>The point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our
ultronoscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within
certain limitations of course), and electronic instruments would
be virtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but
natural electronic activities were carefully eliminated from our
apparatus, (except electrophone receivers which are not easily
spotted) the Hans did have some very highly sensitive sound
devices which operated with great efficiency in calm weather, so
far as sounds emanating from the air were concerned. But the
"ground roar" greatly confused their use of these instruments in
the location of specific sounds floating up from the surface of
the earth.</p>

<p>This ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however,
in its sensitive instruments, for we heard electronic devices go
into play, and picked up the routine report of the noise to its
Base Ship Commander. But from the nature of the conversation, I
judged they had not identified it, and were, in fact, more
curious about the detonations they were picking up now from the
Bad Blood lands some sixty miles to the west.</p>

<p>Immediately after this ship had shot by, we took to the air
again, and following much the same route that I had taken the
previous night, climbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean,
swung toward the north and finally the west. We set our course,
however, for the Sinsing land north of Nu-Yok, instead of for the
city itself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE FINGER OF
DOOM</h2>

<p class="first">AS we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles
north of the city, we dropped several units of the M Intelligence
Division, with full instrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases
were nicely balanced at only a few ounces weight each, and the
men used their chute capes to ease their drops.</p>

<p>We recrossed the river a little distance above and began
dropping A Intelligence units and a few long and short range gun
units. Then we held our position until we began to get reports.
Gradually we ringed the territory of the Sinsings, our
observation units working busily and patiently at their beamers
and scopes, both aloft and aground, until Garlin finally turned
to me with the remark:</p>

<p>"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We've got clear
locations all the way around them."</p>

<p>"Let me see it," I replied, and studies the illuminated
viewplate map with its little overlapping circles of light that
indicated spots proved clear of the enemy by ultrascopic
observation.</p>

<p>I nodded to Bill Hearn. "Go ahead now, Hearn," I said. "and
place your barrage men."</p>

<p>He spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to
glide in a wide ring around the enemy territory. Every few
seconds, at the word from his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off
the wire, and slipping the clasp of his chute cape, drift down
into the darkness below. Bill formed two lines, parallel to and
facing the river and enclosing the entire territory of the enemy
between them. Above and below, straddling the river, were two
defensive lines. These latter were merely to hold their
positions. The others were to close in toward each other, pushing
a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two
barrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range
barrage and continue to close in on any of the enemy who might
have drifted through the previous curtain of fire.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a
hundred men (the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our
fight with the Han squadron) in the air, divided about equally
among the "kite tails" of four ships.</p>

<p>A final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and
functions, established the fact that all our forces were in
position. No Han activity was reported, and no broadcasts
indicated any suspicion of our expedition. Nor was there any
knowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep ray
generators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously
those of the ships the Hans had given them.</p>

<p>Again I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his
subordinates.</p>

<p>Far below us, and several miles to the right and left, two
barrage lines made their appearance. From the great height to
which we had risen; they appeared lines of brilliant, winking
lights, and the detonations were muffled by the distances into a
sort of rumbling distant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were
very busy measuring, calculating, and snapping out ultrophone
orders to unit commanders that resulted in the straightening of
lines and the closing of gaps in the barrage.</p>

<p>The A Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the
Sinsing organization (they were an inefficient, disciplined
gang), and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.
Ignoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for
many generations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that
they were being raided by the Hans themselves, to whom the sound
of the battle was evidently audible, and who were trying to
locate the trouble.</p>

<p>At this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city
went into action as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its
"kite tail" loaded with long-range gunners, using the most highly
explosive rockets we had hung invisible in the darkness of the
sky and bombarded the city from a distance of about five miles.
With an entire city to shoot at, and the object of creating as
much commotion therein as possible, regardless of actual damage,
the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I could see
the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding
rockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on,
fell back on a defensive policy, and shot their "hell cylinder,"
or wall of upturned disintegrator rays into operation. That, of
course, ended our bombardment of them. The rays were a perfect
defense, disintegrating our rockets as they were reached.</p>

<p>If they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and
if they had none within sufficient radius already in the air, all
would be well.</p>

<p>I queried Garlin on this, but he assured me M intelligence
reported no indications of Hans ships nearer than 800 miles. This
would probably give us a free hand for a while, since most of
their instruments recorded only imperfectly, or not at all,
through the death wall. Requisitioning one of the viewplates of
the headquarters ship, and the services of an expert operator, I
instructed him to focus on our lines below. I wanted a close-up
of the men in action.</p>

<p>He began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved
rapidly across the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he
reached an adjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor,
apparently 100 feet wide, with the intervening branches and
foliage of the trees appearing like shadows that melted into
reality above the ground.</p>

<p>I watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed.
His lips pursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he
adjusted the tall tripod on which the tube was balanced. Swiftly
he twirled the knobs controlling the aim and elevation of his
piece. Then, lifting a belt of ammunition from the big box, which
itself looked heavy enough to break down the spindly tripod, he
inserted the end of it in the lock of his tube and touched the
proper combination of buttons.</p>

<p>Then he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering
through the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I
knew that at intervals of something less than a second, it was
discharging small projectiles which, traveling under their own
continuously reduced power, were arching into the air, to fall
precisely five miles ahead and explode with the force of eight-
inch shells such as we used in the First World War.</p>

<p>Another gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand
and called out something to him. Then, picking up his own tube
and tripod, he gauged the distance between the trees ahead of
him, and the height of their lowest branches, and bending forward
a bit, flexed his muscles and leaped lightly, some twenty-five
feet. Another leap took him another twenty feet or so, where he
began to set up his piece.</p>

<p>I ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He
got a close focus on it, but this showed little except a
continuous series of blinding flashes, which, from the viewplate,
lit up the entire interior of the ship. An eight-hundred-foot
focus proved better. I had thought that some of our French and
American artillery of the 20th Century had achieved the ultimate
in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never seen anything
to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions as it
moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass
(or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and
the splintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth
of from ten to twenty feet.</p>

<p>By now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines
of vibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction,
inevitably squeezing the panic-stricken Sinsing between them.</p>

<p>Even as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a
futile effort to get their three rep ray machines into the air,
abandoned their efforts, and rushed forth into the milling
mob.</p>

<p>I queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this
attempt of theirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt
as to what was going on, had continued to "play safe," and broken
off their power broadcast, after ordering all their own ships
east of the Alleghenies to the ground, for fear these ships they
had traded to the Sinsings might be used against them. Again I
turned to my viewplate, which was still focused on the central
section of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was
entirely that of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached
them.</p>

<p>Some of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over
the barrage line, then gave it up. They realized that they had no
target to shoot at, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a
few hundred feet or several miles beyond it.</p>

<p>Their ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood
around in tense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around
their ears, nervously fingering the tuning controls at their
belts. Unquestionably they must have located some of our
frequencies, and overheard many of our reports and orders. But
they were confused and disorganized. If they had an Ultrophone
Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an organized
way. They were beginning to draw back now before our advancing
fire. With intermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our
barrage again, and the explosions of their rockets flashed at
widely scattered points beyond. A few took distance "pot
shots."</p>

<p>Oddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first
casualties in the battle. Some of these distance shots by chance
registered hits, while our men were under strict orders not to
exceed their barrage distances.</p>

<p>Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as
though it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day,
while the explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra
brilliance.</p>

<br>

<p>The two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet
apart when the Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen.
We noticed first that they began to lighten themselves by
throwing away extra equipment A few of them in their excitement
threw away too much, and shot suddenly into the air. Then a
scattered few floated up gently, followed by increasing numbers,
while still others, preserving a weight balance, jumped toward
the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear them. Some
succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a windstorm,
to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the
barrage, their belts blown from their bodies.</p>

<p>However, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of
them to escape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the
word to Bill Hearn to have the alternate men in his line raise
their barrages and heard him bark out a mathematical formula to
the Unit Bosses.</p>

<p>We backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air
in stagger formation until they reached a height of three miles.
I don't believe any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to
freedom succeeded.</p>

<p>But we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got
away and ultimately reached Nu-Yok.</p>

<p>It was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the
most trouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw
we would not have enough to establish successive ground barrages
and so ordered the barrage back two miles, from which positions
our "curtains" began to close in again, this time, however,
gauged to explode, not on contact, but thirty feet in the air.
This left little chance for the Sinsings to leap either over or
under it.</p>

<p>Gradually, the two barrages approached each other until they
finally met, and in the gray dawn the battle ended.</p>

<p>Our own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground
forces, eighteen of whom had been slain in hand-to-hand fighting
with the few of the enemy who managed to reach our lines, and
sixty-two in the crew and "kite tail" force of swooper No.4,
which had been located by one of the enemy's ultroscopes and
brought down with long-gun fire.</p>

<p>Since nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had so far as we
knew, been killed, we considered the raid a great success.</p>

<p>It had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all
of us who took part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our
barrage tactics definitely established a confidence in our
ability to overcome the Hans.</p>

<p>As I pointed out to Wilma:</p>

<p>"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American
explosive rocket is a far more efficient weapon than the dis ray
of the Hans, once we can train all our gang to use it
systematically and in co-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the
hands of a single individual, shooting at a mark in direct line
of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior in destructive power to the
dis ray, except as its range may be a little greater. The trouble
is that to date it has been used only as we used our rifles and
shotguns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its use as
artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or
climb into the air, are tremendous.</p>

<p>"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The
rocket gun does not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a
straight line. The rocket may be made to travel in an arc, over
intervening obstacles, to an unseen target.</p>

<p>"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a
perfect shield against the dis ray in inertron."</p>

<p>"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that
are ahead of us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses
against our new tactics. And they are sure to mass against us not
only the full force of their power in America, but the united
forces of the World Empire."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," I prophesied, "the Finger of Doom points
squarely at them today, and unless you and I are killed in the
struggle, we shall live to see America blast the Mongolian Blight
from the face of the Earth."</p>
