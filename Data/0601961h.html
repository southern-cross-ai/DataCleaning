  <p class="first">The gold strike which led the fortune-hunters to Murrayville
  brought with them the usual proportion of bad men and outlaws. Three months
  after the rush started a bandit appeared so consummate in skill and so cool
  in daring that all other offenders against the law disappeared in the shade
  of his reputation. He was a public dread. His comings were unannounced; his
  goings left no track. Men lowered their voices when they spoke of him. His
  knowledge of affairs in the town was so uncanny that people called him the
  "Ghost."</p>

  <p>The stages which bore gold to the railroad one hundred and thirty miles to
  the south left at the most secret hours of the night, but the Ghost knew.
  Once he "stuck up" the stage not a mile from town while the guards were still
  occupied with their flasks of snakebite. Again, when the stage rolled on at
  midday, eighty miles south of Murrayville, and the guards nodded in the
  white- hot sun, the Ghost rose from behind a bush, shot the near-leader, and
  had the cargo at his mercy in thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>He performed these feats with admirable <i>finesse.</i> Not a single death
  lay charged to his account, for he depended upon surprise rather than
  slaughter. Yet so heavy was the toll he exacted that the miners passed from
  fury to desperation.</p>

  <p>They organized a vigilance committee. They put a price on his head. Posses
  scoured the region of his hiding-place, Hunter's Cañon, into which he
  disappeared when hard pressed, and left no more trace than the morning mist
  which the sun disperses. A hundred men combed the myriad recesses of the
  cañon in vain. Their efforts merely stimulated the bandit.</p>

  <p>While twoscore men rode almost within calling distance, the Ghost appeared
  in the moonlight before Pat McDonald and Peters and robbed them of eighteen
  pounds of gold-dust which they carried in their belts. When the vigilance
  committee got word of this insolent outrage they called a mass- meeting so
  large that even drunken Geraldine was enrolled.</p>

  <p>Never in the history of Murrayville had there been so grave and dry-
  throated an affair. William Collins, the head of the vigilantes, addressed
  the assembly. He rehearsed the list of the Ghost's outrages, pointed out that
  what the community needed was an experienced man-hunter to direct their
  efforts, and ended by asking Silver Pete to stand up before them. After some
  urging Pete rose and stood beside Collins, with his hat pushed back from his
  gray and tousled forelock and both hands tugging at his cartridge-belt.</p>

  <p>"Men," went on Collins, placing one hand on the shoulder of the man-
  killer, "we need a leader who is a born and trained fighter, a man who will
  attack the Ghost with system and never stop after he takes up the trail. And
  I say the man we need is Silver Pete!"</p>

  <p>Pete's mouth twitched back on one side into the faint semblance of a grin,
  and he shrugged off the patronizing hand of the speaker. The audience
  stirred, caught each other with side-glances, and then stared back at Silver
  Pete. His reputation gave even Murrayville pause, for his reputed killings
  read like the casualty list of a battle.</p>

  <p>"I repeat," said Collins, after the pause, in which he allowed his first
  statement to shudder its way home, "that Silver Pete is the man for us. I've
  talked it over with him before this, and he'll take the job, but he needs an
  inducement. Here's the reward I propose for him or for any other man who
  succeeds in taking the Ghost prisoner or in killing him. We'll give him any
  loot which may be on the person of the bandit. If the Ghost is disposed of in
  the place where he has cached his plunder, the finder gets it all. It's a
  high price to pay, but this thing has to be stopped. My own opinion is that
  the Ghost is a man who does his robbing on the side and lives right here
  among us. If that's the case, we'll leave it to Silver Pete to find him out,
  and we'll obey Pete's orders. He's the man for us. He's done work like this
  before. He has a straight eye, and he's fast with his six-gun. If you want to
  know Pete's reputation as a fighting man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll tell you himself," said a voice, and a laugh followed.</p>

  <p>Silver Pete scowled in the direction of the laugh, and his right hand
  caressed the butt of his gun, but two miners rose from the crowd holding a
  slender fellow between them.</p>

  <p>"It's only Geraldine," said one of them. "There ain't no call to flash
  your gun, Pete."</p>

  <p>"Take the drunken fool away," ordered Collins angrily. "Who let him in
  here? This is a place for men and not for girl-faced clowns!"</p>

  <p>"Misher Collins," said Geraldine, doffing his broad-brimmed hat and
  speaking with a thick, telltale accent&mdash;"Misher Collins, I ask your
  pardon, shir."</p>

  <p>He bowed unsteadily, and his hat brushed the floor.</p>

  <p>"I plumb forgot I was in church with Silver Pete for a preacher!" he went
  on.</p>

  <p>The audience turned their heads and chuckled deeply.</p>

  <p>"Take him out, will you?" thundered Collins. "Take him out, or I'll come
  down there and kick him out myself!"</p>

  <p>The two men at Geraldine's side turned him about and led him toward the
  door. Here he struggled away from his guides. "Misher Collins!" he cried in a
  voice half-whining and half-anger, "if I capture the Ghost do <i>I</i>get the
  loot?"</p>

  <p>A yell of laughter drowned the reply, and Geraldine staggered from the
  room.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, men?" roared Collins, enraged by these repeated
  interruptions. "Is Silver Pete the man for us?"</p>

  <p>There was no shout of approval but a deep muttering of consent.</p>

  <p>"I'd hire the devil himself," murmured one man, "if he'd get rid of the
  Ghost."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Collins, and he turned to Pete. "You're in charge here,
  and it's up to you to tell us what to do. You're the foreman, and we're all
  in your gang."</p>

  <p>The crowd was delighted, for Pete, finding himself deserted before the
  mass of waiting men, shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and kept
  changing the angle of the hat upon his mop of gray hair.</p>

  <p>"Speech!" yelled a miner. "Give us a speech, Pete!" Silver Pete favored
  the speaker with a venomous scowl.</p>

  <p>"Speech nothin'," he answered. "I ain't here to talk. I ain't no gossipin'
  bit of calico. I got a hunch my six-gun'll do my chatterin' for me."</p>

  <p>"But what do you want us to do, Pete?" asked Collins. "How are we going to
  help you?"</p>

  <p>"Sit tight and chaw your own tobacco," he said amiably. "I don't want no
  advice. There's been too many posses around these diggin's. Maybe I'll start
  and hunt the Ghost by myself. Maybe I won't. If I want help I'll come askin'
  it."</p>

  <p>As a sign that the meeting had terminated he pulled his hat farther down
  over his eyes, hitched his belt, and stalked through the crowd without
  looking to either side.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Murrayville saw nothing of him for a month, during which the
  Ghost appeared five times and escaped unscathed. The community pondered and
  sent out to find Pete, but the search was vain. There were those who held
  that he must have been shot down in his tracks by the Ghost, and even now
  decorated some lank hillside. The majority felt that having undertaken his
  quest alone Pete was ashamed to appear in the town without his victim.</p>

  <p>On the subject of the quest Geraldine composed a ballad which he sang to
  much applause in the eight saloons of the town. It purported to be the
  narrative of Silver Pete's wanderings in search of the Ghost. In singing it
  Geraldine borrowed a revolver and belt from one of the bystanders, pushed
  back his hat and roughed up his hair, and imitated the scowling face of Pete
  so exactly that his hearers fairly wept with pleasure. He sang his ballad to
  the tune of "Auld Lang Syne," and the sad narrative concluded with a wailing
  stanza:</p>

  <p class="poem">"I don't expect no bloomin' tears;<br>
  The only thing I ask<br>
  Is something for a monument<br>
  In the way of a whisky flask."</p>

  <p>Geraldine sang himself into popularity and many drinks with his song, and
  for the first time the miners began to take him almost seriously. He had
  appeared shortly after old John Murray struck gold six months before, a
  slender man of thirty-five, with a sadly drooping mouth and humorous
  eyes.</p>

  <p>He announced himself as Gerald Le Roy Witherstone, and was, of course,
  immediately christened "Geraldine."</p>

  <p>Thereafter he wandered about the town, with no apparent occupation except
  to sing for his drinks in the saloons. Hitherto he had been accepted as a
  harmless and amusing man-child, but his ballad gave him at once an Homeric
  repute, particularly when men remembered that the song was bound to come
  sooner or later to the ear of Silver Pete.</p>

  <p>For the time being Pete was well out of ear-shot. After the meeting, at
  which he was installed chief man-hunter of the community, he spent most of
  the evening equipping himself for the chase. Strangely enough, he did not
  hang a second revolver to his belt nor strap a rifle behind his saddle;
  neither did he mount a fleet horse. To pursue the elusive Ghost he bought a
  dull-eyed mule with a pendulous lower lip. On the mule he strapped a heavy
  pack which consisted chiefly of edibles, and in the middle of the night he
  led the mule out of Murrayville in such a way as to evade observation. Once
  clear of the town he headed straight for Hunter's Cañon.</p>

  <p>Once inside the mouth of the cañon he began his search. While he worked he
  might have been taken for a prospector, for there was not a big rock in the
  whole course of the cañon which he did not examine from all sides. There was
  not a gully running into Hunter's which he did not examine carefully. He
  climbed up and down the cliffs on either side as if he suspected that the
  Ghost might take to wings and fly up the sheer rock to a cave.</p>

  <p>The first day he progressed barely a half-mile. The second day he covered
  even less ground. So his search went on. In the night he built a fire behind
  a rock and cooked. Through four weeks his labor continued without the vestige
  of a clue to reward him. Twice during that time he saw posses go thundering
  through the valley and laughed to himself. They did not even find him, and
  yet he was making no effort to elude them. What chance would they have of
  surprising the Ghost?</p>

  <p>This thought encouraged him, and he clung to the invisible trail, through
  the day and through the night, with the vision of the outlaw's loot before
  him. He ran out of bacon. Even his coffee gave out. For ten days he lived on
  flour, salt, and water, and then, as if this saintly fast were necessary
  before the vision, Pete saw the Ghost.</p>

  <p>It was after sunset, but the moon was clear when he saw the fantom rider
  race along the far side of the valley. The turf deadened the sound of the
  horse's hoofs, and, like another worldly apparition, the Ghost galloped close
  to the wall of the valley&mdash;and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Peter rubbed his eyes and looked again. It give him a queer sensation, as
  if he had awakened suddenly from a vivid dream, for the horse, with its
  rider, had vanished into thin air between the eyes of Peter and the sheer
  rock of the valley wall. A little shudder passed through his body, and he
  cursed softly to restore his courage.</p>

  <p>Yet the dream of plunder sent his blood hotly back upon its course. He
  carefully observed the marks which should guide him to the point on the rock
  at which the rider disappeared. He hobbled the mule, examined his revolver,
  and spun the cylinder, and then started down across the cañon.</p>

  <p>He had camped upon high ground, and his course led him on a sharp descent
  to the stream which cut the heart of the valley. Here, for two hundred yards,
  trees and the declivity of the ground cut off his view, but when he came to
  the higher ground again he found that he had wandered only a few paces to the
  left of his original course.</p>

  <p>The wall of the valley was now barely fifty yards away, and as nearly as
  he could reckon the landmarks, the point at which the rider vanished was at
  or near a shrub which grew close against the rock. For an instant Pete
  thought that the tree might be a screen placed before the entrance of a cave.
  Yet the rider had made no pause to set aside the screen. He walked up to it
  and peered beneath the branches. He even fumbled at the base of the trunk, to
  make sure that the roots actually entered the earth. After this faint hope
  disappeared, Pete stepped back and sighed. His reason vowed that it was at
  this point that the horse turned to air, and Pete's was not a nature which
  admitted the supernatural.</p>

  <p>He turned to the left and walked along the face of the cliff for fifty
  paces. It was solid rock. A chill like a moving piece of ice went up Pete's
  back.</p>

  <p>He returned to the shrub and passed around it to the right.</p>

  <p>At first he thought it merely the black shadow of the shrub. He stepped
  closer and then crouched with his revolver raised, for before him opened a
  crevice directly behind the shrub. It was a trifle over six feet high and
  less than half that in width; a man could walk through that aperture and lead
  a horse. Pete entered the passage with cautious steps.</p>

  <p>Between each step he paused and listened. He put forth a foot and felt the
  ground carefully with it, for fear of a pebble which might roll beneath his
  weight, or a twig which might snap. His progress was so painfully slow that
  he could not even estimate distances in the pitch-dark. The passage grew
  higher and wider&mdash;it turned sharply to the right&mdash;a faint light
  shone.</p>

  <p>Pete crouched lower and the grin of expectancy twisted at his lips. At
  every step, until this moment; he had scarcely dared to breathe, for fear of
  the bullet which might find him out. Now all the advantage was on his side.
  Behind him was the dark. Before him was the light which must outline, however
  faintly, the figure of any one who lurked in wait. With these things in mind
  he went on more rapidly. The passage widened again and turned to the left. He
  peered cautiously around the edge of rock and looked into as comfortable a
  living-room as he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>The rock hung raggedly from the top of the cave, but the sides were smooth
  from the action of running water through long, dead ages. The floor was of
  level-packed gravel. Silver Pete remained crouched at the sharp angle of the
  passage until he heard the stamp and snort of a horse. It gave him heart and
  courage to continue the stealthy progress, inch by inch, foot by foot, pace
  by pace toward the light, and as he stole forward more and more of the cave
  developed before him.</p>

  <p>A tall and sinewy horse was tethered at one end, and at the opposite side
  sat a man with his back to Pete, who leveled his revolver and drew a bead on
  a spot between the shoulder blades. Yet he did not fire, for the thought came
  to him that if it were an honor to track the Ghost to his abode and kill him,
  it would be immortal glory to bring back the bandit alive, a concrete
  testimony to his own prowess.</p>

  <p>Once more that catlike progress began until he could see that the Ghost
  sat on his saddle in front of a level-topped boulder in lieu of a table. The
  air was filled with the sweet savor of fried bacon and coffee. Pete had
  crawled to the very edge of the cave when the horse threw up its head and
  snorted loudly. The Ghost straightened and tilted back his head to
  listen.</p>

  <p>"Up with yer hands!" snarled Silver Pete.</p>

  <p>He had his bead drawn and his forefinger tightened around the trigger, but
  the Ghost did not even turn. His hands raised slowly above his shoulders to
  the level of his head and remained there.</p>

  <p>"Stand up!" said Pete, and rose himself from the ground, against which he
  had flattened himself. For if the Ghost had decided to try a quick play with
  his gun the shot in nine cases out of ten would travel breast-high.</p>

  <p>"Turn around!" ordered Pete, feeling more and more sure of himself as he
  studied the slight proportions of the outlaw.</p>

  <p>The Ghost turned and showed a face with a sad mouth and humorous eyes.</p>

  <p>"By God!" cried Silver Pete, and took a pace back which brought his
  shoulders against the wall of rock, "Geraldine!"</p>

  <p>If the Ghost had had his gun on his hip he could have shot Pete ten times
  during that moment of astonishment, but his belt and revolver hung on a
  jutting rock five paces away. He dropped his hands to his hips and smiled at
  his visitor.</p>

  <p>"When they put you on the job, Pete," he said, "I had a hunch I should
  beat it."</p>

  <p>At this inferred compliment the twisted smile transformed one side of
  Silver Pete's face with sinister pleasure, but there was still wonder in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Damn me, Geraldine," he growled, "I can't believe my eyes!"</p>

  <p>Geraldine smiled again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's me, all right," he nodded. "You got me dead to rights, Pete.
  What do you think the boys will do with me?"</p>

  <p>"And you're&mdash;the Ghost?" sighed Silver Pete, pushing back his hat as
  though to give his thoughts freer play. He had met many a man of grim repute
  along the "border," but never such nonchalance as he found in the Ghost.</p>

  <p>"What'll they do with you?" he repeated, "I dunno. You ain't plugged
  nobody, Geraldine. I reckon they'll ship you South and let the sheriff handle
  you. Git away from that gun!"</p>

  <p>For Geraldine had stepped back with apparent unconcern until he stood
  within a yard of his revolver. He obeyed the orders with unshaken good humor,
  but it seemed to Silver Pete that a yellow light gleamed for an instant in
  the eyes of the Ghost. It was probably only a reflection from the light of
  the big torch that burned in a corner of the cave.</p>

  <p>"Gun?" grinned Geraldine. "Say, Pete, do you think I'd try and gunplay
  while <i>you</i> have the drop on me?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Nope," he went on. "If you was one of those tinhorn gunmen from the town
  over yonder, I'd lay you ten to one I could drill you and make a getaway, but
  you ain't one of them, Pete, and, seeing it's you, I ain't going to try no
  funny stuff. I don't hanker after no early grave, Pete!"</p>

  <p>This tribute set a placid glow of satisfaction in Pete's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Take it from me, Geraldine," he said, "you're wise. But there ain't no
  need for you to get scared of me so long as you play the game square and
  don't try no fancy moves. Now show me where you got the loot stowed and show
  it quick. If you don't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The threat was unfinished, for Geraldine nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sure I'll show it to you, Pete," he said. "I know when I got a hand
  that's worth playing, and I ain't a guy to bet a measly pair of treys against
  a full house. Take a slant over there behind the rock and you'll find it
  all."</p>

  <p>He indicated a pile of stones of all sizes which lay heaped in a corner.
  Pete backed toward it with his eye still upon the Ghost. A few kicks
  scattered the rocks and exposed several small bags. When he stirred these
  with his foot their weight was eloquent, and the gun-fighter's smile
  broadened.</p>

  <p>"Think of them tin-horns," he said, "that offered all your pickings to the
  man that got you dead or alive, Geraldine!"</p>

  <p>The Ghost sighed.</p>

  <p>"Easy pickings," he agreed. "No more strong-arm work for you, Pete!"</p>

  <p>The jaw of Silver Pete set sternly again.</p>

  <p>"Lead your hoss over here," he said, "and help me stow this stuff in the
  saddlebags. And if you make a move to get the hoss between me and
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Ghost grinned in assent, saddled his mount, and led him to Pete. Then
  in obedience to orders he unbuckled the slicker strapped behind the saddle
  and converted it into a strong bag which easily held the bags of loot. It
  made a small but ponderous burden, and he groaned with the effort as he
  heaved it up behind the saddle and secured it. Pete took the bridle and
  gestured at the Ghost with the revolver.</p>

  <p>"Now git your hands up over your head agin, Geraldine," he said, "and go
  out down the tunnel about three paces ahead of me."</p>

  <p>"Better let me take the torch," suggested the Ghost, "it'll show us the
  way."</p>

  <p>Pete grunted assent, and Geraldine, on his way toward the torch, stopped
  at the boulder to finish off his coffee. He turned to Pete with the cup
  poised at his lips.</p>

  <p>"Say, Pete," he said genially. "Anything wrong with a cup of coffee and a
  slice of bacon before we start back?"</p>

  <p>"By God, Geraldine," grinned the gun-fighter, "you're a cool bird, but
  your game is too old!"</p>

  <p>Nevertheless his very soul yearned toward the savor of bacon and
  coffee.</p>

  <p>"Game?" repeated the Ghost, who caught the gleam of Pete's eye. "What
  game? I say let's start up the coffee-pot and the frying-pan. I can turn out
  flapjacks browner than the ones mother used to make, Pete!"</p>

  <p>Pete drew a great breath, for the taste of his flour and water diet of the
  past few days was sour in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Geraldine," he said at last, "it's a go! But if you try any funny passes
  I ain't going to wait for explanations. Slide out the chow!"</p>

  <p>He rolled a large stone close to the boulder which served as dining-table
  to the bandit, and sat down to watch the preparations. The Ghost paid little
  attention to him, but hummed as he worked. Soon a fire snapped and crackled.
  The coffee can straddled one end of the fire; the frying-pan occupied the
  other. While the bacon fried he mixed self-rising pancake flour in a tin
  plate, using water from a tiny stream which trickled down from the rocks at
  one side of the cave, disappearing again through a fissure in the floor. Next
  he piled the crisp slices of bacon on a second tin plate and used the
  fried-out fat to cook the flapjacks.</p>

  <p>"What I can't make out," said Geraldine, without turning to his guest, "is
  why you'd do this job for those yellow livers over in the town."</p>

  <p>Pete moved the tip of his tongue across his lips, for his mouth watered in
  anticipation.</p>

  <p>"Why, you poor nut," he answered compassionately, "I ain't working for
  them. I'm working for the stuff that's up there behind the saddle."</p>

  <p>Geraldine turned on him so suddenly that Pete tightened his grip upon the
  revolver, but the Ghost merely stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Say," he grinned at last, "have you got a hunch they'll really let you
  walk off with all that loot?"</p>

  <p>The face of the gunman darkened.</p>

  <p>"I sure think they'll let me," he said with a sinister emphasis. "That was
  the way they talked."</p>

  <p>Geraldine sighed in apparent bewilderment, but turned back to his work
  without further comment. In a few moments he rose with the plates of bacon
  and flapjacks piled on his left arm and the can of coffee in his right hand.
  He arranged them on the boulder before Silver Pete, and then sat on his heels
  on the other side of the big stone. The gun-fighter laid his revolver beside
  his tin cup and attacked the food with the will of ten. Yet even while he ate
  the eye which continually lingered on the Ghost noted that the latter stared
  at him with a curious and almost pitying interest. He came to a pause at
  last, with a piece of bacon folded in a flapjack.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "just what were you aiming at a while ago?"</p>

  <p>Geraldine shrugged his shoulders and let his eye wander away as though the
  subject embarrassed him.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" said Pete with some show of anger, "don't go staring around
  like a cross-eyed girl. What's biting you?"</p>

  <p>"It ain't my business," he said. "As long as I'm done for, I don't care
  what they do to you."</p>

  <p>He stopped and drummed his finger-tips against his chin while he scowled
  at Pete.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't for you I'd be a free bird," he went on bitterly. "Do you
  think I'm goin' to weep any of the salt and briny for you, what?" \</p>

  <p>"Wha'd'ya mean?" Pete blurted. "D'ya mean to say them quitters are going
  to double-cross me?"</p>

  <p>The Ghost answered nothing, but the shrug of his shoulders was eloquent.
  Pete started up with his gun in his hand.</p>

  <p>"By God, Geraldine," he said, "you ain't playin' fair with me! Look what I
  done for you. Any other man would of plugged you the minute they seen you,
  but here I am lettin' you walk back safe and sound&mdash;treating you as if
  you was my own brother, almost!"</p>

  <p>He hesitated a trifle over this simile. Legend told many things of what
  Silver Pete had done to his own brother. Nevertheless, Geraldine met his
  stare with an eye full as serious.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to do it," he said in a low voice, as if talking to himself.
  "Just because you come out here and caught me like a man there ain't no
  reason I should stand by and see you made a joke of. Pete, I'm going to tell
  you!"</p>

  <p>Pete settled back on his stone with his fingers playing nervously about
  the handle of his gun.</p>

  <p>"Make it short, Geraldine," he said with an ominous softness. "Tell me
  what the wall-eyed cayuses figure on doin'!"</p>

  <p>The Ghost studied him as if he found some difficulty in opening his story
  in a delicate manner.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Pete," he said at last. "There ain't no getting out of it that
  some of the things you've done read considerable different from Bible
  stories."</p>

  <p>"Well?" snarled Silver Pete.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the Ghost, "those two-card Johnnies over to town know
  something of what you've done, and they figure to double-cross you."</p>

  <p>He paused, and in the pause Pete's mouth twitched so that his teeth
  glinted yellow.</p>

  <p>"Anybody could say that," he remarked. "What's your proof?"</p>

  <p>"Proof?" echoed the Ghost angrily. "Do you think I'm telling you this for
  fun? No, Pete," he continued with a hint of sadness in his voice, "it's
  because I don't want to see those guys do you dirt. You're a real man and
  they're only imitation-leather. The only way they're tough is their
  talk."</p>

  <p>"Damn them!" commented Pete.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Geraldine, settling into the thread of his narrative, "they
  knew that once you left the town on this job you wouldn't come back until you
  had the Ghost. Then when you started they got together and figured this way.
  They said you was just a plain man-killer and that you hadn't any more right
  to the reward than the man in the moon. So they figured that right after you
  got back with the Ghost, dead or alive, they'd have the sheriff pay you a
  little visit and stick you in the coop. They've raked up plenty of charges
  against you, Peter."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked Pete hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The Ghost lowered his voice to an insinuating whisper.</p>

  <p>"One thing is this. They say that once you went prospecting with a guy
  called Red Horry. Horace was his right name."</p>

  <p>Silver Pete shifted his eyes and his lips fixed in a sculptured grin.</p>

  <p>"They say that you went with him and that you was pals together for months
  at a time. They say once you were bit by a rattler and Red Horry stuck by you
  and saved you and hunted water for you and cared for you like a baby. They
  say you got well and went on prospecting together and finally he struck a
  mine. It looked rich. Then one day you come back to Truckee and say that Red
  Horry got caught in a landslide and was killed and you took the mine. And
  they say that two years later they found a skeleton, and through the skull,
  right between the eyes, was a little round hole, powerful like a hole made by
  a .45. They say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They lie!" yelled Silver Pete, rising. "And you lie like the rest of
  them. I tell you it was&mdash;it was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Huh!" said Geraldine, shrugging away the thought with apparent scorn. "Of
  course they lie. Nobody could look at you and think you'd plug a pal
  &mdash;not for nothing."</p>

  <p>Pete dropped back to his stone.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said. "What else do they say?"</p>

  <p>"I don't remember it all," said the Ghost, puckering his brows with the
  effort of recollection, "but they got it all planned out when you come back
  with the loot they'll take it and split it up between them&mdash;one-third to
  Collins, because he made the plan first.</p>

  <p>"They even made up a song about you," went on Geraldine, "and the song
  makes a joke out of you all the way through, and it winds up like this&mdash;
  you're supposed to be talking, see?</p>

  <p class="poem">"I don't expect no bloomin' tears;<br>
  The only thing I ask<br>
  Is something for a monument<br>
  In the way of a whisky flask."</p>

  <p>"Who made up the song, Geraldine?" asked Pete.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," answered the Ghost. "I reckon Collins had a hand in it."</p>

  <p>"Collins," repeated the gun-fighter. "It sounds like him. I'll get him
  first!"</p>

  <p>"And it was Collins," went on the Ghost, leaning a little forward across
  the boulder, while he lowered his voice for secrecy. "It was Collins who got
  them to send out three men to watch you from a distance. They was to trail
  you and see that if you ever got to the Ghost you didn't make off with the
  loot without showing up in town. Ever see anybody trailing you, Pete?"</p>

  <p>The gun-fighter flashed a glance over his shoulder toward the dark and
  gaping opening of the passage from the cave. Then he turned back to the
  Ghost.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of it," he whispered. "I didn't know they was such
  skunks. But, by God, they won't ever see the money! I'll take it and line out
  for new hunting grounds."</p>

  <p>"And me?" asked the Ghost anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You?" said Silver Pete, and the whisper made the words trebly sinister.
  "I can't leave you free to track me up, can I? I'll just tie you up and leave
  you here."</p>

  <p>"To starve?" asked the Ghost with horror.</p>

  <p>"You chose your own house," said Pete, "an" now I reckon it's good enough
  for you to live in it."</p>

  <p>"But what'll you do if they're following you up?" suggested the Ghost.
  "What'll you do if they've tracked you here and the sheriff with them? What
  if they get you for Red Horry?"</p>

  <p>The horse had wandered a few paces away. Now its hoof struck a loose
  pebble which turned with a crunching sound like a footfall.</p>

  <p>"My God!" yelled the Ghost, springing up and pointing toward the entrance
  passage, "they've got you, Pete!"</p>

  <p>The gun-fighter whirled to his feet, his weapon poised and his back to the
  Ghost. Geraldine drew back his arm and lunged forward across the boulder. His
  fist thudded behind Silver Pete's ear. The revolver exploded and the bullet
  clicked against a rock, while Pete collapsed upon his face, with his arms
  spread out crosswise. The Ghost tied his wrists behind his back with a small
  piece of rope. Silver Pete groaned and stirred, but before his brain cleared
  his ankles were bound fast and drawn up to his wrists, so that he lay trussed
  and helpless. The Ghost turned him upon one side and then, strangely enough,
  set about clearing up the tinware from the boulder. This he piled back in its
  niche after he had rinsed it at the runlet of water. A string of oaths
  announced the awakening of Silver Pete. Geraldine went to him and leaned over
  his body.</p>

  <p>Pete writhed and cursed, but Geraldine kneeled down and brushed the sand
  out of the gun-fighter's hair and face. Then he wiped the blood from a small
  cut on his chin where his face struck a rock when he fell.</p>

  <p>"I have to leave you now, Pete," he said, rising from this work of mercy.
  "You've been good company, Pete, but a little of you goes a long way."</p>

  <p>He turned and caught his horse by the bridle.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake!" groaned Silver Pete, and Geraldine turned. "Don't leave
  me here to die by inches. I done some black things, Geraldine, but never
  nothing as black as this. Take my own gun and pull a bead on me and we'll
  call everything even."</p>

  <p>The Ghost smiled on him.</p>

  <p>"Think it over, Pete," he said. "I reckon you got enough to keep your mind
  busy. So-long!"</p>

  <p>He led his horse slowly down the passage, and the shouts and pleadings of
  Silver Pete died out behind him. At the mouth of the passage his greatest
  shout rang no louder than the hum of a bee.</p>

  <p>Grimly silent was the conclave in Billy Hillier's saloon. That evening,
  while the sunset was still red in the west, the Ghost had stopped the stage
  scarcely a mile from Murrayville, shot the sawed-off shotgun out of the very
  hands of the only guard who dared to raise a weapon, and had taken a valuable
  packet of the "dust." They sent out a posse at once, which rode straight for
  Hunter's Cañon, and arrived there just in time to see the fantom horseman
  disappear in the mouth of the ravine. They had matched speed with that rider
  before, and they gave up the vain pursuit. That night they convened in
  Hillier's, ostensibly to talk over new plans for apprehending the outlaw, but
  they soon discovered that nothing new could be said. Even Collins was silent,
  twisting his glass of whisky between his fingers and scowling at his
  neighbors along the bar. It was small wonder, therefore, if not a man smiled
  when a singing voice reached them from a horseman who cantered down the
  street:</p>

  <p class="poem">"I don't expect no bloomin' tears;<br>
  The only thing I ask<br>
  Is something for a monument<br>
  In the way of a whisky flask."</p>

  <p>The sound of the gallop died out before the saloon, the door opened, and
  Geraldine staggered into the room, carrying a small but apparently ponderous
  burden in his arms. He lifted it to the bar which creaked under the
  weight.</p>

  <p>"Step up and liquor!" cried Geraldine in a ringing voice. "I got the
  Ghost!"</p>

  <p>A growl answered him. It was a topic over which they were not prepared to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Get out and tell that to your hoss, son," said one miner. "We got other
  things to think about than your damfoolery."</p>

  <p>"Damfoolery?" echoed Geraldine. "Step up and look at the loot! Dust, boys,
  real dust!"</p>

  <p>He untied the mouth of a small buckskin bag and shoved it under the nose
  of the man who had spoken to him. The latter jumped back with a yell and
  regarded Geraldine with fascinated eyes.</p>

  <p>"By God, boys," he said, "it <i>is</i> dust!"</p>

  <p>Geraldine fought off the crowd with both hands.</p>

  <p>"All mine!" he cried. "Mine, boys! You voted the loot to the man who
  caught the Ghost!"</p>

  <p>"And where's the Ghost?" asked several men together.</p>

  <p>"Geraldine," said Collins, pushing through the crowd, "if this is another
  joke we'll hang you for it!"</p>

  <p>"It's too heavy for a joke," grinned Geraldine. "I'll put the loot in your
  hands, Collins, and when I show you the Ghost I'll ask for it again."</p>

  <p>Collins caught his shoulder in a strong grasp.</p>

  <p>"Honest to God?" he asked. "Have you got him?"</p>

  <p>"I have," said Geraldine, "and I'll give him to you on one ground."</p>

  <p>"Out with it," said Collins.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Geraldine, "when you see him you'll recognize him. He's been
  one of us!"</p>

  <p>"I knew it," growled Collins; "some dirty dog that lived with us and
  knifed us in the back all the time."</p>

  <p>"But, remember," said Geraldine, "he never shot to kill, and that's why
  you sha'n't string him up. Is it a bargain?"</p>

  <p>"It's a bargain," said Collins, "we'll turn him over to the sheriff. Are
  you with me, boys?"</p>

  <p>They yelled their agreement, and in thirty seconds every man who had a
  horse was galloping after Collins and Geraldine. At the shrub beside the wall
  of the valley Geraldine drew rein, and they followed him in an awed and
  breathless body into the passage.</p>

  <p>"I went out scouting on my own hook," explained Geraldine, as he went
  before them, "and I saw the Ghost ride down the cañon and disappear in here.
  I followed him."</p>

  <p>"Followed up this passage all alone?" queried Collins.</p>

  <p>"I did," said Geraldine.</p>

  <p>"And what did you do to him?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see in a minute. There was only one shot fired, and it came from
  his gun."</p>

  <p>They turned the sharp angle and entered the lighted end of the passage. In
  another moment they crowded into the cave and stood staring at the tightly
  bound figure of Silver Pete. His eyes burned furiously into the face of
  Geraldine. The men swarmed about his prostrate body.</p>

  <p>"Untie his feet, boys," said Collins, "and we'll take him back. Silver
  Pete, you can thank your lucky stars that Geraldine made us promise to turn
  you over to the law."</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?" he continued, turning to Geraldine.</p>

  <p>"I'm not very handy with a gun," said the Ghost, "so I tackled him with my
  fists. Look at that cut on his jaw. That's where I hit him!"</p>

  <p>A little murmur of wonder passed around the group. One of them cut the
  rope which bound Pete's ankles together, and two more dragged him to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Stand up like a man, Pete," said Collins, "and thank Geraldine for not
  cutting out your rotten heart!"</p>

  <p>But Silver Pete, never moving his eyes from the face of the Ghost, broke
  into a long and full-throated laugh.</p>

  <p>"Watch him, boys!" called Collins sharply. "He's going looney! Here, Jim,
  grab on that side and I'll take him here. Now start down the tunnel."</p>

  <p>Yet, as they went forward, the rumbling laugh of the gun-fighter broke out
  again and again.</p>

  <p>"I got to leave you here," said the Ghost, when they came out from the
  mouth of the passage. "My way runs east, and I got a date at Tuxee for to-
  night. I'll just trouble you for that there slicker with the dust in it,
  Collins."</p>

  <p>Without a word the vigilance men unstrapped the heavy packet which he had
  tied behind his saddle. He fastened it behind Geraldine's saddle and then
  caught him by the hand.</p>

  <p>"Geraldine," he said, "you're a queer cuss! We haven't made you out yet,
  but we're going to take a long look at you when you come back to Murrayville
  to- morrow."</p>

  <p>"When I come back," said Geraldine, "you can look at me as long as you
  wish."</p>

  <p>His eyes changed, and he laid a hand on Collins's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Take it from me," he said softly, "you've given me your word that the
  boys won't do Pete dirt. Remember, he never plugged any of you. He's got his
  hands tied now, Collins, and if any of the boys try fancy stunts with him
  &mdash;maybe I'll be making a quick trip back from Tuxee. Savvy?"</p>

  <p>His eyes held Collins for the briefest moment, and then he swung into his
  saddle and rode east with the farewell yells of the posse ringing after him.
  By the time they were in their saddles Geraldine had topped a hill several
  hundred yards away and his figure was black against the moon. A wind from the
  east blew back his song to them faintly:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"I don't expect no bloomin' tears;<br>
  The only thing I ask<br>
  Is something for a monument<br>
  In the way of a whisky flask."</p><br>

  <p>"Look at him, boys," said Collins, turning in his saddle. "If it wasn't
  for what's happened to-night, I'd lay ten to one that that was the Ghost on
  the wing for his hiding-place!"</p>
