<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<h4>THE STRANGE BEHAVIOUR OF CAPTAIN VAN TOCH</h4>

<p>If you looked up the little island of Tana Masa on the map you
would find it just on the Equator, not far south of Sumatra; but if
you were on the deck of the Kandong Bandoeng and asked its captain,
J. van Toch, what he thought of this Tana Masa where you've just
dropped anchor he would first curse for a short while and then he
would tell you that it's the dirtiest hole all the Sunda Islands,
even more loathsome than Tana Bala and easily as damnable as Pini or
Banyak; that the only apology for a human being that lives there--
not counting these louse-ridden Bataks, of course--is a drunken
commercial agent, a cross between a Cuban and a Portuguese, and an
even bigger thief, pagan and pig than the whole of Cuba and the whole
of the white race put together; if there's anything in this world
that's damnable then it's the damned life on this damned Tana Masa.
And then, you might cautiously ask him why it is that he's just
dropped his damned anchor as if he wanted to spend three damned days
here; at which he would snort in irritation and grumble something
about not being so damned stupid as to sail all the way to Kandon
Bandoeng just to get this damned copra or palm oil, and there's
nothing else here, but I've got my damned orders, and you will please
be so kind as to mind your own damned business. And he would carry
on cursing as widely and as fully as you might expect from a sea
captain who was no longer young but still lively for his age.</p>

<p>But if, instead of asking all sorts of impertinent questions, you
left Captain J. van Toch to grumble and curse by himself you might
find out something more. Surely it's obvious the man needs a rest.
Just leave him alone, he can sort out his foul mood by himself.
"Listen!" the captain said suddenly. "Those damned Jew-boys back in
Amsterdam, all they seem to think about is pearls. Have a look
around you; can you see any pearls? They say the people are crazy
round here for pearls and that sort of thing." At this point the
captain spat in anger. "We know all about that, load up with
pearls! That's because you people always want to start a war or
something. All you're worried about is money. And then you call it
a crisis." For a short while, Captain J. van Toch considered whether
he ought to start discussing political economics, considering that
that's all they ever do talk about nowadays. But it's too hot and
languid to talk about that sort of thing here, anchored off Tana
Masa; so the captain merely waved his hand and grumbled: "That's what
they say, pearls! In Ceylon they've got enough pearls piled up to
last them for five years, on Formosa they've put a ban on gathering
them--and so they say to me, Captain van Toch, go and see if you can
find somewhere new to gather pearls. Go on down to those damned
little islands, you might find whole bays full of oysters down there
..." The captain pulled out his light-blue handkerchief and blew
his nose in contempt. "Those rats in Europe, they think there's
still something to find down here, something they don't already know
about. God, what a bunch of fools they are! Next they'll be wanting
me to look up the Bataks snouts to see if they don't have them full
of pearls. New pearl fisheries! I know there's a new brothel in
Padang, but new pearl fisheries? I know these islands like my
trousers, all the way from Ceylon down to that damned Clipperton
Island, and if anyone thinks there's anything new still left to find
there that they can make any money out of, well good luck to them.
Thirty years I've been sailing these waters, and now these fools
think I'm going to discover something new!" This was a task so
insulting it made Captain van Toch gasp. "Why can't they send some
green kid to find something for them if they want to gape in
astonishment; but instead they expect someone to do that who knows
the area as well as Captain J. van Toch...Please try and
understand this. In Europe there might still be something left to
discover; but here--people only come here to sniff out something
they could eat, or rather not even to eat, to find something to buy
and sell. If in all these damned tropics there was still something
they could double the price of there'd be three commercial agents
standing there waving their snotty handkerchiefs at the ships of
seven countries to stop for it. That's how it is. I know about
these things better than the colonial office of Her Majesty the
Queen, if you'll forgive me." Captain van Toch made a great effort
to overcome his righteous indignation, and after a prolonged period
of exertion he was successful. "D'you see those two contemptible
layabouts down there? They're pearl fishers from Ceylon, Sinhalese,
God help us, just as the Lord made them; but what He made them for, I
don't know. I have them on board with me, and when we find any
stretch of coast that doesn't have a sign up saying Agency or Bata or
Customs Office down they go in the water to look for oysters. That
small bugger, he can dive down eighty meters deep; in the Princes
Islands he went down to ninety meters to get the handle from a film
projector. But pearls? Nothing! Not a sniff of them! Worthless
rabble, these Sinhalese. And that's the sort of worthless work I
do. Pretend to be buying palm oil and all the time looking for new
pearl fisheries. Next they'll be wanting me to find a new virgin
continent for them. This isn't a job for an honest captain in the
merchant navy. Captain J. van Toch isn't some cursed adventurer,
no. And on he would go; the sea is wide and the ocean of time has
no limits; spit in the sea, my friend, and it will not return, berate
your destiny and you will never change it; and so on through many
preparations and circumstances until we finally arrive at the point
when J. van Toch, captain of the Dutch vessel, Kandong Bandoeng, will
sigh and climb down into the boat for the trip to Tana Masa where he
will negotiate with the drunken half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese
extraction about certain business matters.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Captain," the half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese
extraction finally said, "but here on Tana Masa there aren't any
oysters. These filthy Bataks," he would inform him with boundless
disgust, "will even eat the jellyfish; there are more of them in the
water than on the land, the women here smell of fish, you cannot
imagine what it is like--what was I saying? Ah, yes, you were
asking about women."</p>

<p>"And is there not even any stretch of coastline round here," the
captain asked, "where these Bataks don't go in the water?" The
half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese shook his head.</p>

<p>"There is not. Unless you count Devil Bay, but that would not
interest you."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because...no-one is allowed to go there. Another drink,
Captain?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. Are there sharks there?"</p>

<p>"Sharks and everything else besides," the half-cast mumbled. "Is
a bad place, Captain. The Bataks would not like to see anyone going
down there."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"There are demons there, Captain. Sea demons."</p>

<p>"What is that, a sea demon? A kind of fish?"</p>

<p>"Not a fish," the half-cast corrected him. "Simply demons,
Captain. Underwater demons. The Bataks call them tapa. Tapa. They
say that that's where they have their city, these demons. Another
drink?"</p>

<p>"And what do they look like, these sea demons?" The half cast of
Cubanese and Portuguese shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Like a demon, Captain. I once saw one of them...or just its
head, at least. I was coming back in a boat from Cape Haarlem...
and suddenly, in front of me, a kind of lump stuck up out of the
water."</p>

<p>"And what did it look like?"</p>

<p>"It had a head...like a Batak, Captain, but entirely without
hair."</p>

<p>"Sure it wasn't a real Batak?"</p>

<p>"Not a real Batak, Captain. In this place no Batak would ever go
into the water. And then...the thing blinked at me with an
eyelid from beneath its eye." The half-cast shuddered with the
horror of it. "An eyelid from beneath its eye, which reached up to
cover the whole eye. That was a tapa." Captain J. van Toch turned
his glass of palm wine around between his chubby fingers.</p>

<p>"And you hadn't been drinking, had you? You weren't drunk?"</p>

<p>"I was drunk, Captain. How else would I ever had rowed into that
place. The Bataks don't like it when anyone...anyone disturbs
these demons." Captain van Toch shook his head.</p>

<p>"Listen, demons don't exist And if they did exist they would look
like Europeans. That must have been some kind of fish you saw or
something."</p>

<p>"A fish!" the half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese spluttered. "A
fish does not have hands, Captain. I am not some Batak Captain, I
went to school in Badyoeng...I might even still know my ten
commandments and other scientifically proven facts; and an educated
man will know the difference between a demon and an animal. Ask the
Bataks, Captain."</p>

<p>"Negro superstitions," the captain declared with the jovial
confidence of an educated man. "This is scientific nonsense. A
demon can't live in water anyway. What would he be doing in the
water? You shouldn't listen to all the nonsense talked by the
natives, lad. Somebody gave the place the name Devil Bay and ever
since then the Bataks have been afraid of it. That's all there is to
it," the captain declared, and threw his chubby hand down on the
table. "There's nothing there, lad, that is scientifically
obvious."</p>

<p>"There is, Captain," affirmed the half-cast who had been to school
in Badyoeng. "But no sensible person has any business going to Devil
Bay." Captain J. van Toch turned red.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he shouted. "You dirty Cuban, you think I'm afraid
of these demons? We'll see about that," he said as he stood up with
all the mass of his honest two hundred pounds. "I'm not going to
waste my time with you here, not when I've got business to attend
to. But just remember this; the Dutch colonies don't have any demons
in them; even if there are in the French.  There, there might well
be. And now call the mayor of this damned Kampong over to speak to
me."</p>

<p>It did not take long to find the aforementioned dignitary; he was
squatting down beside the half-casts shop chewing sugar cane. He was
an elderly man, naked, but a lot thinner than mayors usually are in
Europe.  Some way behind him, keeping the appropriate distance, the
entire village was also squatting, complete with women and children.
They were clearly expecting to be filmed. "Now listen to this, son,"
Captain van Toch said to him in Malay (he could just as well have
spoken to him in Dutch or English as the honourable old Batak knew
not a word of Malay, and everything said by the captain had to be
interpreted into Batak by the half-cast of Cubanese and Portuguese,
but for some reason the captain thought Malay would be more
appropriate). "Now listen to this, son, I need a few big, strong,
powerful lads to go out on a fishing trip with me. Understand what I
mean? Out on a fishing trip."  The half-cast translated this and
the mayor nodded his head to show he understood; then he turned round
to face the wider audience and said something to them, clearly
meeting with great success.</p>

<p>"Their chief says," translated the half-cast, "that the whole
village will go out with the captain wherever the captain might
wish."</p>

<p>"Very well. So tell him were going to fish for clams in Devil
Bay."</p>

<p>There followed about fifteen minutes of animated discussion with
the whole village taking part, especially the old women. Finally the
half-cast turned to the captain. "They say it's not possible to go
to Devil Bay, Captain." The captain began to turn red.   "And
why not?" The half-cast shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Because there are the tapa-tapa there. Demons, Captain." The
captain's colour began to rise to purple.</p>

<p>"Tell them, then, that if they don't go...I'll knock all their
teeth out...I'll tear their ears off...I'll hang the lot of
them...and that I'll burn down their entire flea-ridden village.
Understand?"</p>

<p>The half-cast dutifully translated what the captain had said, at
which there was more lively discussion. The half-cast finally turned
to the captain. "They say they intend to make a complaint to the
police in Padang, Captain, because you've threatened them. There
seem to be laws about that. The mayor says he can't allow that sort
of thing." Captain J. van Toch began to turn blue.</p>

<p>"Tell him, then," he snarled, "that he is a..." and he spoke
without pausing for breath for a good eleven minutes.</p>

<p>The half-cast translated what he had said, as far as his
vocabulary was able; and then he once again translated the Bataks
long, but objective, verdict back to the captain. "They say they
might be willing to relinquish taking you to court, Captain, if you
pay a fine into the hands of the local authorities. They suggest,"
here he hesitated, "two hundred rupees, Captain; but that seems
rather a lot. Offer them five." Captain van Toch's complexion began
to break out in purple blotches. First he offered to murder all the
Bataks in the world, then the offer went down to giving them all
three hundred good kickings, and finally he agreed to content himself
with stuffing the mayor and putting him on display in the colonial
museum in Amsterdam; for their part, the Bataks went down from two
hundred rupees to an iron pump with a wheel, and finally insisted on
no more than that the captain give the mayor his petrol cigarette
lighter as a token. ("Give it to him, Captain," urged the half-cast
of Cubanese and Portuguese, "I've got three cigarette lighters in my
store, even if they don't have wicks.") Thus, peace was restored on
Tana Masa; but Captain J. van Toch now knew that the dignity of the
white race was at stake.</p>

<p>That afternoon a boat set out from the Dutch ship, Kandon
Bandoeng, with the following crew: Captain J. van Toch, Jensen the
Swede, Gudmundson the Icelander, Gillemainen the Finn, and two
Sinhalese pearl fishers. The boat headed straight for Devil Bay.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, when the tide was at its highest, the captain
stood on the shore, the boat was out watching for sharks about a
hundred meters offshore, and both the Sinhalese divers were waiting,
knife in hand, for the signal to jump into the water.</p>

<p>"Now you go in," the captain told the farther of the two naked
savages. The Sinhalese jumped into the water, waded out a few paces
and then dived. The captain looked at his watch.</p>

<p>After four minutes and twenty seconds a brown head emerged to his
left, about sixty meters away; with a strange, desperate shudder
which seemed at the same time as if paralysed, the Sinhalese clawed
at the rocks, in one hand he had the knife, in the other some pearl
bearing oysters. The captain scowled. "So, what's wrong?" he asked,
sharply. The Sinhalese was still slithering up the rock, unable to
speak with the horror of it. "What has happened?" the captain
shouted.</p>

<p>"Saheb, Saheb," said the Sinhalese as he sank down on the beach,
gasping for breath. "Saheb...Saheb..."</p>

<p>"Sharks?"</p>

<p>"Djinns," groaned the Sinhalese. "Demons, Captain. Thousands and
thousands of demons!" He pressed his fist into his eye. "Everywhere
demons, Captain!"</p>

<p>"Show me those oysters," the captain ordered him, and began to
open one with the knife. Inside, there was a small, perfect pearl.
"Find any more of these?" The Sinhalese drew another three oysters
out from the bag he had hanging round his neck.</p>

<p>"There are oysters down there, Captain, but they are guarded by
these demons...They were watching me as I cut them off..." The
curls on his head stuck out with shock. "Not here, Saheb, not
here!"</p>

<p>The captain opened the oysters; two of them were empty and in the
third there was a pearl the size of a pea, as round as a drop of
mercury. Captain van Toch looked at the pearl and then at the
Sinhalese collapsed on the ground.</p>

<p>"won't you," he said hesitantly, "dive in there one more time?"
Without a word, the Sinhalese shook his head. Captain J. van Toch
felt a strong urge to castigate and shout at the Sinhalese; but to
his surprise he found that he was speaking quietly and almost gently:
"Don't you worry, lad. And what did they look like, these...
demons?"</p>

<p>"Like little children," said the Sinhalese with a sigh. "They
have a tail, Captain, and they're about this high," indicating about
one meter twenty above the ground. "They stood all around me and
watched what I was doing...a sort of circle of them..."  The
Sinhalese shuddered. "Saheb, not here Saheb, not here!" Captain van
Toch thought for a while.</p>

<p>"And what about when they blink; was it with their lower eyelid or
what?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Captain," the Sinhalese croaked. "There are ten
thousand of them there!" The captain looked round to find the other
Sinhalese; he stood about fifty meters away, waiting without interest
with his hands crossed over on his shoulders; perhaps because when a
person is naked he has nowhere else to put his hands than on his own
shoulders. The captain gave him a silent signal and the gaunt
Sinhalese jumped into the water. After three minutes and fifty
seconds he re-emerged, clawing at the slippery rocks.</p>

<p>"Come on, hurry up," the captain shouted, but then he began to
look more carefully and soon he himself was jumping and clambering
over the rocks to the Sinhalese; no-one would have thought that a
body like that could jump so nimbly. At the last moment he caught
hold of the Sinhalese hand and pulled him breathless from the water.
Then he lay him on the rock and wiped the sweat off his brow. The
Sinhalese lay without moving; his shin had been scraped and the bone
underneath was exposed, clearly he had injured it on some rock, but
he was otherwise unhurt. The captain raised the man's eyelid; all he
could see was the white. There was no sign of any oysters or the
knife. Just then, the boat and its crew came in close to shore.</p>

<p>"Captain," Jensen the Swede called, "there are sharks around
here. Are you going to search for oysters any longer?"</p>

<p>"No," said the captain. "Come in here and pick up these
two."</p>

<p>On the way back to the ship Jensen drew the captains attention to
something; "Look how it suddenly becomes shallow just here. It goes
on just like this as far as the shore." And he demonstrated his
point by pushing his oar down into the water. "it's as if there were
some kind of weir under the water."</p>

<p>The little Sinhalese did not come round until they were back on
board; he sat with his knees under his chin, shaking from head to
toe. The captain sent everyone away and sat down facing him with his
legs wide apart. "Out with it," he said. "What did you see down
there?"</p>

<p>"Djinns, Saheb," whispered the slender Sinhalese; now even his
eyelids had begun to shake, and the whole of his skin came out in
goosepimples.  </p>

<p>"And...what did they look like?" the captain spluttered.</p>

<p>"Like...like..." A strip of white appeared once more in the
Sinhalese eyes. Captain J. van Toch, with unexpected liveliness,
slapped him on both cheeks with his full hand to bring him back to
consciousness. "Thanks, Saheb," the gaunt Sinhalese sighed, and the
pupils re-appeared in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Alright now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Saheb."</p>

<p>"Were there oysters down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Saheb."</p>

<p>With a great deal of patience and thoroughness, Captain J. van
Toch went on with the cross questioning. Yes, there were demons down
there. How many? Thousands and thousands. About the size of a ten
year old child, Captain, and almost black. They swim in the water,
and on the bottom they walk on two legs. Two legs, Saheb, just like
you or me, but always swaying from side to side, like this, like
this, like this...Yes Captain, they have hands too, just like
people; no, they don't have claws, they're more like a child's
hands. No, Saheb, they don't have horns or fur. Yes, they have a
tail, a little like a fish's tail but without the fins. And a big
head, round like a Bataks. No, they don't say anything, Captain,
only a sort of squelch. When the Sinhalese had been cutting an
oyster off, about sixteen metres down, he felt something like little
cold fingers touch his back. He had looked round and there were
hundreds and hundreds of them all around him. Hundreds and hundreds,
Captain, swimming around and standing on stones and all of them were
watching what the Sinhalese was doing. So he dropped the knife and
the oyster and tried to swim up to the surface. Then he struck
against some of the demons who had been swimming after him, and what
happened next he did not know.</p>

<p>Captain J. van Toch looked thoughtfully at the little diver as he
sat there shivering. Hell be no good for anything from now on, the
said to himself, he would send him to Padang and back on home to
Ceylon. Grumbling and snorting, the captain went to his cabin, where
he spilled the two pearls out onto the table from a paper bag. One
of them was as small as a grain of sand and the other as a pea, with
a shimmer of silver and pink. And with that, the captain of the
Dutch ship, Kandong Bandoeng, snorted; and then he reached into the
cupboard for his bottle of Irish whiskey.</p>

<p>At six o clock he had himself rowed back to the village and went
straight to the half cast of Cubanese and Portuguese. "Toddy," he
said, and that was the only word he uttered; he sat on the
corrugated-iron veranda, clutched a thick glass tumbler in his chubby
fingers and drank and spat and stared out from under his bushy
eyebrows at the dirty and trampled yard where some emaciated yellow
chickens pecked at something invisible between the palm trees. The
half cast avoided saying anything, and merely poured the drinks.
Slowly, the captain's eyes became bloodshot and his fingers began to
move awkwardly. It was almost dark when he stood up and tightened
his trousers.</p>

<p>"Are you going to bed, Captain?" the half cast of demon and devil
asked politely. The captain punched his fist in the air.</p>

<p>"I'm going to go and see if there are any demons in this world
that I've never seen before. You, which damned way is
north-west?"</p>

<p>"This way," the half cast showed him. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Hell," Captain J. van Toch rasped. "Going to have a look at
Devil Bay."</p>

<div class="section">
<p>It was from that evening on that Captain J. van Toch's behaviour
became so strange. He did not return to the village until dawn; said
not a word to anyone but merely had himself taken back to the ship,
where he locked himself in his cabin until evening. Nobody thought
this very odd as the Kandong Bandoeng had some of the blessings of
Tana Masa to load on board (copra, pepper, camphor, guttapercha, palm
oil, tobacco and labourers); but that evening, when they went to tell
him that everything had been loaded, he just snorted and said,
"Boat. To the village." And he did not return until dawn. Jensen
the Swede, who helped him back on board, merely asked him politely
whether they would be setting sail that day. The captain turned on
him as if he had just been knifed in the back. "And what's it to
you?" he snapped. "You mind your own damned business!" All that day
the Kandong Bandoeng lay at anchor off the coast of Tana Masa and did
nothing. In the evening the captain rolled out of his cabin and
ordered, "Boat. To the village." Zapatis, the little Greek,
stared at him with his one blind eye and the other eye squinting.
"Look at this lads," he crowed, "either the old mans got some girl or
he's gone totally mad." Jensen the Swede scowled. "And what's it to
you?" he snapped at Zapatis. "You mind your own damned business!"
Then, together with Gudmundson the Icelander, he took the little boat
and rowed down to Devil Bay. They stayed in the boat behind the
rocks and waited to see what would happen. The captain came across
the bay and seemed to be waiting for someone; he stopped for a while
and called out something like ts-ts-ts. "Look at this," said
Gudmundson, pointing to the sea which now glittered red and gold in
the sunset. Jensen counted two, three, four, six fins, as sharp as
little scythes, which glided across Devil Bay. "Oh God," grumbled
Jensen, "there are sharks here!" When, shortly afterwards, one of
the little scythes submerged, a tail swished out above the water and
created a violent eddy. At this, Captain J. van Toch on the shore
began to jump up and down in fury, issued a gush of curses and
threatened the sharks with his fist. Then the short tropical
twilight was over and the light of the moon shone over the island;
Jensen took the oars and rowed the boat to within a furlong of the
shore. Now the captain was sitting on a rock calling ts-ts-ts.
Nearby something moved, but it was not possible to see exactly what.
It looks like a seal, thought Jensen, but seals don't move like
that. It came out of the water between the rocks and pattered along
the beach, swaying from side to side like a penguin. Jensen quietly
rowed in and stopped half a furlong away from the captain. Yes, the
captain was saying something, but the Devil knew what it was; he must
have been speaking in Tamil or Malay. He opened his hands wide as if
about to throw something to these seals (although Jensen was now sure
they were not seals), and all the time babbling his Chinese or
Malay. Just then the raised oar slipped out of Jensen's hand and
fell in the water with a splash. The captain lifted his head, got up
and walked about thirty paces into the water; there was a sudden
flashing and banging; the captain was shooting with his browning in
the direction of the boat. Almost simultaneously there was a
rustling and a splashing in the bay as, with a whirl of activity, it
seemed as if a thousand seals were jumping into the water; but Jensen
and Gudmundson were already pressing on the oars and driving the boat
so hard that it swished through the water until it was behind the
nearest corner. When they got back to the ship they said not a word
to anyone. The northern races know how to keep silent. In the
morning the captain returned; he was angry and unhappy, but said
nothing. Only, when Jensen helped him on board both men gave each
other a cold and inquisitive look.</p>

<p>"Jensen," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Today, we set sail."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"In Surabai you get your papers."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>And that was it. That day the Kandong Bandoeng sailed into
Padang. In Padang Captain J. van Toch sent his firm in Amsterdam a
parcel insured for a thousand two hundred pounds sterling. At the
same time he sent a telegram asking for his annual leave. Urgent
medical reasons, and so on. Then he wandered around Padang until he
found the man he was looking for. This was a native of Borneo, a
Dayak who English tourists would sometimes hire as a shark hunter
just for the show; as this Dayak still worked in the old way, armed
with no more than a long knife. He was clearly a cannibal but he had
his fixed terms: five pounds for a shark plus his board. He was also
quite startling in appearance, as both hands, his breast and his legs
were heavily scarred from contact with shark skin and his nose and
ears were decorated with shark teeth. He was known as Shark.</p>

<p>With this Dayak, Captain J. van Toch set off back to the island of
Tana Masa.</p>

<h4>MISTER GOLOMBEK AND MISTER VALENTA</h4>

<div class="section">
<p>As far as the newspapers were concerned, it was the sort of hot
day when nothing, absolutely nothing, happens, when no politics is
done and there aren't even any tensions in Europe; but it is just on
days like this that newspaper readers, lying in an agony of boredom
on the beaches or in the sparse shade of trees, demoralised by the
heat, the view, the quiet of the countryside and all that makes up
their healthy and simple life on holiday, hope in vain to find to
find something in the newspapers, something that will be new and
refreshing, some murder, some war or some earthquake, in short,
anything; and when they are disappointed they throw the paper down
and declare in irritation that there is nothing there, nothing
whatsoever, that it is not worth reading and they will stop buying a
newspaper in future.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the editorial office, there are five or six people
left by themselves, as their colleagues are also all on holiday, who
throw the paper down in irritation and complain that there is nothing
there, nothing whatsoever. And the type-setter comes out of the
composing-room and warns them: "Gentlemen, we still don't have a
leader for tomorrow's issue".</p>

<p>"Well how about, er, that thing about the economic situation in
Bulgaria?" suggests one of the gentlemen in the abandoned office.
The type-setter sighs deeply:</p>

<p>"And who's going to want to read that? Once again, there's going
to be nothing in the whole paper worth reading." The six gentlemen
left all by themselves raised their eyes to the ceiling as if they
might find something worth reading about there.</p>

<p>"If only something would happen," said one of them
uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Or what about, er, some kind of interesting reportage," suggested
another.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"We could think up...some new vitamin or something," grumbled a
third.</p>

<p>"What now? In the middle of the summer?" a fourth objected.
"Look, vitamins are scientific things, that's more suitable for the
Autumn."</p>

<p>"God it's hot!" yawned the fifth. "Whatever it is it ought to
come from the polar regions."</p>

<p>"Such as what?"</p>

<p>"Something like that Eskimo story. Frozen fingers, eternal ice,
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"That's easy enough to say," said the sixth, "but where do we get
the story from?" The silence of despair spread across the editorial
office.</p>

<p>"Last Sunday," began the typesetter hesitantly, "I was in the
Moravian hills."</p>

<p>"So what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I heard something about some Captain Vantoch who was on
holiday there. Seems he was born in the area."</p>

<p>"Vantoch? Who's he?"</p>

<p>"Fat sort of bloke. A sea captain or something. They said he'd
been out looking for pearls." Mister Golombek looked at Mister
Valenta.</p>

<p>"And whereabouts was he looking?"</p>

<p>"In Sumatra...and the Celebese...all round that sort of area.
They said he'd spent thirty years out there."</p>

<p>"Now there's an idea," said Mister Valenta. "That could be a
great reportage. Shall we go with it, Golombek?"</p>

<p>"Can give it a try, I suppose," Mister Golombek opined, and got
off his chair.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>"It's that gentleman, over there," said the landlord in Moravia.
At a table in the garden sat a fat man in a white cap with his legs
wide apart, he was drinking beer and seemed thoughtful as he drew
broad lines on the table with his finger. Both men went over to
him.</p>

<p>"I'm Valenta, editorial staff."</p>

<p>"I'm Golombek, editorial staff." The fat man raised his eyes:</p>

<p>"Eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Valenta, from the newspaper."</p>

<p>"And I'm Golombek. From the newspaper." The fat man stood up
with dignity.</p>

<p>"Captain van Toch. Very glad. Take a seat, lads." Both men
obligingly sat down and lay writing pads down in front of
themselves. "What'll you have to drink, boys?"</p>

<p>"Raspberry juice," said Mister Valenta.</p>

<p>"Raspberry juice?" repeated the captain in disbelief. "What for?
Landlord, bring them each a beer.--Now what was it you wanted?" he
asked, putting his elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"Is it true that you were born here, Mister Vantoch?"</p>

<p>"Ja. Born here."</p>

<p>"And tell us, please, how come you went to sea?"</p>

<p>"I went via Hamburg."</p>

<p>"And how long have you been a captain?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years, lads. Got my papers here," he said, emphasising
his point by tapping on his breast pocket. "Can show you if you
like." Mister Golombek would have liked to see what a captains
papers look like, but he restrained himself.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you must have seen a good part of the world in those
twenty years, Captain."</p>

<p>"Ja, I've seen a bit, ja."</p>

<p>"And what places have you seen?"</p>

<p>"Java. Borneo. Philippines. Fiji Islands. Solomon Islands.
Carolines. Samoa. Damned Clipperton Island. A lot of damned
islands, lads. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's just that it's all very interesting. Wed like to hear
some more about it, you see."</p>

<p>"Ja. All just very interesting, eh?" The captain fixed his pale
blue eyes on them. "You're from the police then, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, were not from the police, Captain, were from the
newspapers."</p>

<p>"Ah ja, from the newspapers. Reporters, are you? We'll write
this down: Captain J. van Toch, captain of the Kandong Bandoeng
..."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The Kandong Bandoeng, port of Surabai. Reason for journey:
vacances...how do you say that?"</p>

<p>"On holiday."</p>

<p>"Ja, dammit, holiday. So you can put that in your newspapers,
who's sailed in. And now put your notes away, lads. Your
health."</p>

<p>"Mister Vantoch, we've come to find you so that you might tell us
something about your life."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"We'll write it down in the papers. People are very interested in
reading about distant islands and all the things seen and experienced
there by their compatriots, by another Czech..." The captain
nodded.</p>

<p>"That's all true, lads, I'm the only sea captain ever from this
town, that's true. I've heard about one other captain from...from
.. somewhere, but I think," he added intimately, "that he's not a
proper captain. It's all to do with the tonnage, you see."</p>

<p>"And what was the tonnage of your ship?"</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand tons, lads."</p>

<p>"You were a great captain, were you?"</p>

<p>"A great one," the captain said with dignity. "Have you got any
money, boys?" Both gentlemen looked at each other a little
uncertainly.</p>

<p>"We have some money, but not a lot. Are you in need of money,
Captain?"</p>

<p>"Ja. I might need some"</p>

<p>"Well listen. If you tell us lots of things we'll write it up for
the paper and you'll get money for it."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"It could be...could be several thousand," said Mister Golombek
generously.</p>

<p>"Pounds sterling?"</p>

<p>"No, only Czechoslovak koruny." Captain van Toch shook his
head.</p>

<p>"No, that won't do. I've got that much myself, lads," and he drew
a thick wad of banknotes out of his trouser pocket. "See?" Then he
put his elbows back on the table and leant forward to the two men.
"Gentlemen, I might have some big business for you. And that would
mean you giving me fifteen...hold on...fifteen or sixteen million
koruny. How about it?" Once again, the two gentlemen looked at each
other uncertainly. Newspaper men have experience of all sorts of the
strangest madmen, cheats and inventors. "Wait," said the captain,
"I've got something here I can show you." His chubby fingers reached
into a pocket in his waistcoat and he hunted out something which he
placed on the table. It was five pink pearls, the size of cherry
stones. "Do you know anything about pearls?"</p>

<p>"What might they be worth?" gasped Mister Valenta.</p>

<p>"Ja, lots of money, lads. But I carry them around just to show
people, just as a sample. So how about it, are you in with me?" he
asked, reaching his broad hand across the table. Mister Golombek
sighed.</p>

<p>"Mister Vantoch, as much money as..."</p>

<p>"Halt," the captain interrupted him. "I realise you don't know
me; but ask about Captain van Toch anywhere in Surabaya, in Batavia,
in Padang or anywhere you like. Go and ask and anyone will tell you
ja, Captain van Toch, he is as good as his word."</p>

<p>"Mister Vantoch, we don't doubt your word," Mister Golombek
protested, "but..."</p>

<p>"Wait," the captain ordered. "I know you want to be careful about
where you give away your precious money; and quite right too. But
here you'll be spending it on a ship, see? You buy a ship, that
makes you a ship owner and you can come with me; ja, you can sail
with me to see how I'm looking after it. And the money we make, we
can share it fifty-fifty. That's honest business, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But Mister Vantoch," Mister Golombek finally exclaimed anxiously,
"we just don't have that much money!"</p>

<p>"Ja, in that case it's different," said the captain. "Sorry. But
now I don't know why you've come to find me."</p>

<p>"So that you can tell us about yourself, Captain, you must have
had so many experiences..."</p>

<p>"Ja, that I have, lads. A damned lot of experiences."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been shipwrecked?"</p>

<p>"What? What shipwreck? No I haven't. Who do you think I am? If
they give me a good ship then nothing can happen to it. You can even
go and ask about my references in Amsterdam. Go there and ask."</p>

<p>"And what about the natives? Have you met many natives?" Captain
van Toch snorted. "This is nothing for an educated man. I'm not
going to talk about that."</p>

<p>"Then tell us about something else."</p>

<p>"Ja, tell you something else," the captain grumbled
mistrustfully. "And then you can sell it to some other company which
then sends its ships out there. I can tell you, my lad, people are
all thieves. And the biggest thieves of all are these bankers in
Colombo."</p>

<p>"Have you been to Colombo many times?</p>

<p>"Ja, many times. And Bangkok too, and Manila...Lads," he
suddenly interrupted himself, "I know of a ship. A very good ship,
and cheap at the price. It's in Rotterdam. Come and have a look at
it. Rotterdam is no distance," and he indicated over his shoulder
with his thumb. "Ships are very cheap nowadays, lads. Like old
iron. As soon as a ship is six years old they want to replace it
with something with a diesel motor. Do you want to see it?"</p>

<p>"We can't, Mister Vantoch."</p>

<p>"You're very strange people," the captain sighed, and blew his
nose noisily into a pale blue handkerchief. "And you don't know of
anyone here who might want to buy a ship?"</p>

<p>"Here in Moravia?"</p>

<p>"Ja, here, or anywhere nearby. I'd like a big deal like this to
come here, to my country."</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you, Captain..."</p>

<p>"Ja. Those others are enormous thieves. And they don't have any
money. People like you, from the newspapers, you must know some
important people here, bankers and ship owners and the like."</p>

<p>"We don't know anyone, Mister Vantoch."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a pity," said the captain, sadly. Mister Golombek
remembered something.</p>

<p>"You don't know Mister Bondy, do you?"</p>

<p>"Bondy? Bondy?" Captain van Toch tried to remember. "Wait, that
name does sound familiar. Bondy. Ja, there's a Bond Street in
London, where all the very rich people live. Does he have some
business on Bond Street, this Mister Bondy?"</p>

<p>"No, he lives in Prague, but I think he was born here in
Moravia."</p>

<p>"Jesus!" Captain van Toch burst out gaily, "you're right lads.
Had a tailors shop on the square. Ja, Bondy, what was his name?
Max. Max Bondy. So he's in business in Prague now, is he?"</p>

<p>"No I think that must have been his father. This Bondy is called
G.H. President G.H. Bondy, Captain."</p>

<p>"G.H.," the captain puzzled. "There was never any G.H. here.
Unless you mean Gustl Bondy--but he was never any president. Gustl
was a sort of freckle-faced Jew. Can't be him."</p>

<p>"It can be him, Mister Vantoch. Don't forget it's many years
since you've seen him."</p>

<p>"Ja, you could be right. It is many years," the captain agreed.
"Forty years, lads. I suppose Gustl could have become important by
now. And what is he?"</p>

<p>"He's the president of the MEAS organisation--you know?--that
enormous factory making boilers and so on, and the president of abut
twenty companies and cartels. He's a very important man, Mister
Vantoch. They call him a captain of Czech industry."</p>

<p>"Captain?" said Captain van Toch in amazement. "So I'm not the
only captain from this town! Jesus! That Gustl is a captain too. I
suppose I ought to meet up with him. Has he got any money?"</p>

<p>"Has he? Enormous amounts of money, Mister Vantoch. He must have
hundreds of millions. The richest man in Czechoslovakia." Captain
van Toch became very serious.</p>

<p>"And a captain, too. Thank you, lads. I'll have to go and see
him, this Bondy. Ja, Gustl Bondy, I know. Jewish boy, he was. And
now its Captain G.H. Bondy. Ja, ja, things change," he added with a
melancholy sigh.</p>

<p>"Captain Vantoch, we'll have to go soon so that we don't miss the
evening train..."</p>

<p>"I'll come down to the harbour with you, then," the captain
suggested and he began to weigh anchor. "Very glad to have met you,
lads. I know a newspaper man in Surabaya, good lad, ja, a good
friend of mine. Hell of a drinker. I could find you both a place on
the paper in Surabaya if you like. No? Well, as you like."</p>

<p>And as the train drew out of the station Captain van Toch waved to
them slowly and triumphantly with his enormous blue handkerchief. As
he did so, one large, slightly mis-shapen pearl dropped down into the
sand. A pearl which nobody ever found again.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<h4>G. H. BONDY AND THE CAPTAIN</h4>

<p>It is a well known fact that the more important a man is the less
he has written on his door. Above his shop in Moravia, and all round
the door and on the windows, old Max Bondy had to announce in big
letters that here was Max Bondy, dealer in sartorial goods of every
sort, wedding outfitter, sheets, towels, teatowels, tablecloths and
coverings, calico and serge, silks, curtains, lambrequins, and all
tailoring and sewing requisites. Founded 1885. His son, G.H. Bondy,
captain of industry, president of the MEAS corporation, commercial
adviser, brokering adviser, deputy president of the Confederation of
Industry, Consulado de la Rep&Atilde;&ordm;blica Ecuador, member of
many advisory committees etc. etc. has nothing more on his house door
than one small, black, glass panel with gold letters that spell the
word:</p>

<p>BONDY</p>

<p>That is all. Just Bondy. Others might have Julius Bondy,
Representative of General Motors on their doors, or Erv&Atilde;&shy;n
Bondy, Doctor of Medicine, or S. Bondy and Company; but there is only
one Bondy who is simply Bondy without any further details. (I think
the Pope has simply Pius written on his door without any title or
number. And God doesn't have a name plate at all, neither in Heaven
nor on Earth. You have to work out for yourself who it is that lives
where He lives. But none of this belongs to this story, and it is
only mentioned in passing.)</p>

<p>One burning hot day, in front of the glass panel there stood a
gentleman in a white sailors cap, wiping the massive folds of his
neck with a blue handkerchief. Damned grand sort of house to live
in, he thought, and somewhat uncertainly he pulled on the brass knob
of the doorbell.</p>

<p>Mister Povondra, the doorman, appeared, took the measure of the
heavy man at the door by looking him up and down from his feet to the
gold braid on the cap, and with some reserve asked: "Can I help
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes you can, lad," the gentleman replied loudly. "Does a Mister
Bondy live here?"</p>

<p>"What is your business with Mister Bondy?" was Mister Povondra's
icy reply.</p>

<p>"Tell him that Captain van Toch from Surabaya wants to speak to
him. Ja," he remembered, "here's my card." And he handed Mister
Povondra a visiting card bearing an embossed anchor and the name:</p>

<p>CAPTAIN J. VAN TOCH</p>

<p>E. I. &amp; P. L. Co S. Kandong Bandoeng</p>

<p>Surabaya Naval Club</p>

<p>Mister Povondra lowered his eyes and considered this. Had he
better tell him that Mister Bondy is not at home? Or that he was
afraid that Mister Bondy is at an important conference? There are
some callers who need to be announced, and there are some others that
a good doorman will deal with himself. Mister Povondra felt a
troubling failure of the instinct that normally guides him in these
matters; this fat man at the door did not somehow fall into the usual
class of unannounced visitors, he did not seem to be a commercial
representative, or a functionary of a charitable organisation.
Meanwhile, Captain van Toch was snorting and wiping his brow with his
handkerchief; at the same time he was blinking ingenuously with his
pale blue eyes. Mister Povondra suddenly decided to take the
responsibility for this man onto himself. "Please come in Captain
van Toch," he said, "I will announce you to Mister Bondy".</p>

<p>Captain J. van Toch wiped his brow with his blue handkerchief and
looked round the ante-room. Hell, this Gustl has got things alright;
it's like the saloon on one of those ships that sail from Rotterdam
to Batavia. It must have cost a fortune. And all that by a freckly
little Jew, the captain thought in admiration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in his study, G.H. Bondy was contemplating the
captain's visiting card. "And what does he want with me?" he asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know, Sir," mumbled Mister Povondra
unctuously. Mister Bondy was still holding the card in his hand.
And embossed ships anchor. Captain J. van Toch, Surabaya--where
actually is Surabaya? Is it somewhere in Java? that seemed a very
long way away to Mister Bondy. Kandong Bandoeng, that sounds like a
gong being struck. Surabaya. And it feels just like the tropics
here, today. Surabaya.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better show him in," Mister Bondy ordered.</p>

<p>The heavy man in the captain's cap stood in the doorway and
saluted. G.H. Bondy went over to welcome him. "Very glad to meet
you, Captain. Please, come in," he said in English.</p>

<p>"Hello, hello Mister Bondy," proclaimed the captain cheerfully in
Czech.</p>

<p>"Are you Czech?" asked Mister Bondy in surprise.</p>

<p>"Ja, Czech. And we even know each other, Mister Bondy. From
Moravia. Vantoch the grain merchant, do you remember?"</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right," G.H. Bondy replied with enthusiasm,
although he did feel a little disappointment that this was not a
Hollander after all. "Vantoch the grain merchant, on the town
square, wasn't it. And you haven't changed at all, Mister Vantoch!
Still just the same! And how's the grain business going?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," the captain replied politely. "It's been a long time
now since Dad...how do you say..."</p>

<p>"Since he died? Oh, of course, you must be his son..." Mister
Bondy's eyes came alive with a sudden memory. My dear Vantoch! You
must be that Vantoch who used to fight with me when we were
lads!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that will have been me, Mister Bondy," agreed the captain
seriously. "In fact that's why they sent me away, to Ostrava, up in
the north."</p>

<p>"You and I were always fighting. But you were stronger than me,"
Mister Bondy acknowledged sportingly.</p>

<p>"Ja, I was stronger than you. You were such a weak little
Jew-boy, Mister Bondy. And you were given Hell for it."</p>

<p>"I was, that's true," mused G.H. Bondy, somewhat moved.  But sit
down, my friend! How nice of you to think of me! What brings you
here?"  Captain van Toch sat down with dignity into a leather
armchair and laid his cap on the floor.</p>

<p>"I'm here on holiday, Mister Bondy. That's so."</p>

<p>"Do you remember," asked Mister Bondy as he sank into his
memories, "how you used to shout at me: Jew-boy, Jew-boy, you go to
Hell.</p>

<p>"Ja," the captain admitted, and he trumpeted with some emotion
into his blue handkerchief. "Oh yes, they were good times, lad. But
what does it matter now? Time passes. Now were both old men and
both captains."</p>

<p>"That's true, you're a captain," Mister Bondy reminded himself.
"Who'd have thought it? A Captain of Long Distances."</p>

<p>"Yessir. A highseaer. East India and Pacific Lines, Sir."</p>

<p>"A wonderful career," said Mister Bondy with a sigh. "I'd change
places with you straight away, Captain. You must tell me about
yourself."</p>

<p>"Alright then, " said the captain as he became more lively.
"There's something I'd like to tell you about, Mister Bondy.
Something very interesting, lad." Captain van Toch looked around
uneasily.                </p>

<p>"Are you looking for something, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Ja. Don't you drink beer, Mister Bondy  The journey here from
Surabaya made me so thirsty." The captain began to rummage in the
copious pockets of his trousers and drew out his blue handkerchief, a
canvas bag containing something, a bag of tobacco, a knife, a compass
and a wad of banknotes. "I think we should send someone out for some
beer. What about that steward who showed me in here to your cabin."
Mister Bondy rang a bell.</p>

<p>"Nothing to worry about, Captain. Meanwhile you could light a
cigar..." The captain took a cigar with a red and gold band and
drew in the aroma.</p>

<p>"Tobacco from Lombok. Bunch of thieves there, for what it's
worth." And with that, to Mister Bondy's horror, he crumbled the
costly cigar in his massive hands and put the it into a pipe. "Ja,
Lombok. Lombok or Sumba." By this time, Mister Povondra had made
his silent appearance in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Bring us some beer," Mister Bondy ordered. Mister Povondra
raised his eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Beer? And how much beer?"</p>

<p>"A gallon," the captain grumbled as he stepped on a used match on
the carpet. "In Aden, the heat was awful, lad. Now, Mister Bondy,
I've got some news for you. From the Sunda Islands, see? There's a
chance there to do some fantastic business. But I'll need to tell
you the whole story. Wait." The captain's eyes turned to the ceiling
as he remembered. "I don't really know where to begin." (Yet
another business deal, thought G.H. Bondy to himself. God, this is
going to be boring. He's going to talk to me about exporting sewing
machines to Tasmania or boilers and safety pins to Fiji. Fantastic
business, yes, I know. That's what I'm good for. But I'm not some
junk dealer, damn it! I'm an adventurer. I'm a poet in my own way.
Tell me about Sinbad, sailor-man! Tell me about Surabaya or the
Phoenix Islands. Have you never been pulled of course by a magnetic
mountain, have you never been captured by the bird, Noh, and taken up
to its nest? Don't you come back to port with a cargo of pearls and
cinnamon and hardwoods? No? Better start your lies, then.) "I
suppose I could start with these lizards," the captain began.</p>

<p>"What lizards?" asked the businessman in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, these astonishing lizards they have there, Mister
Bondy."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"On one of these islands. I can't tell you the name, lad. That
is a big secret, worth millions." Captain van Toch wiped his brow
with his handkerchief. "Where the Hell has that beer got to?"</p>

<p>"It will be right here, Captain."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's good. And you ought to know that these are very
decent and likable animals, these lizards. I know them, lad." The
captain slammed his hand down on the table; "and if anyone says
they're demons they're a liar, a damned liar, Sir. You and me are
more like demons than they are, me, Captain van Toch, Sir. You can
take my word for it." G.H. Bondy was startled. Delirium, he
thought. Where is that damned Povondra? "There are several thousand
of them there, these lizards, but a lot of them are eaten by sharks.
That's why these lizards are so rare and only in one place, in this
bay that I can't give you the name of."</p>

<p>"You mean these lizards live in the sea?"</p>

<p>"Ja. In the sea. But at night they come out onto the shore,
although after a while they have to go back into the water."</p>

<p>"And what do they look like?" (Mister Bondy was trying to gain
time before that damned Povondra came back.)</p>

<p>"Well, about as big as a seal, but when they walk on their hind
legs they'd be about this high," the captain demonstrated. "I won't
tell you they're nice to look at, they're not. And they haven't got
any scales. They're quite bare, Mister Bondy, naked, like a frog or
a salamander. And their front paws, they're like the hands on a
child, but they've only got four fingers. Poor things," the captain
added in sympathy. "But they're nice animals, Mister Bondy, very
clever and very likable." The captain crouched down and, still in
that position, began to waddle forward. "And this is how they walk,
these lizards."</p>

<p>The captain, with some effort and still squatting down, carried
his body along in a wave-like movement; at the same time he held his
hand out in front of himself like a dog begging for something and
fixed his eyes on Mister Bondy in a way that seemed to beg him for
sympathy. G.H. Bondy was deeply touched by this and almost felt
ashamed. While this was going on, Mister Povondra appeared in the
doorway with a jug of beer and raised his eyebrows in shock when he
saw the captain's undignified behaviour. "Give us the beer and get
out," Mister Bondy exclaimed. The captain stood up, wheezing.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what these animals are like, Mister Bondy. Your
health," he added as he took a draught of the beer. "This is good
beer you've got here, lad. But in a house like this..." The
captain wiped his moustache.</p>

<p>"And how did you come across these lizards, Captain?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to tell you about, Mister Bondy. It
happened like this; I was looking for pearls on Tana Masa..." the
captain stopped short. "Or somewhere round those parts. Ja, it was
some other island, but for the time being that's still my secret.
People are enormous thieves, Mister Bondy, you have to be careful
what you say. And while those two damned Sinhalese were under water
cutting away the oysters--the oysters hold as fast to the rocks like
a Jew holds to his faith and have to be cut away with a knife--the
lizards were there watching them, and the Sinhalese thought they were
sea monsters. They're very ignorant people, these Sinhalese and
Bataks. Anyway, they thought they were demons. Ja." The captain
trumpeted noisily into his handkerchief. "You know, lad, it's a
strange thing. I don't know whether us Czechs are more inquisitive
than other people but whenever I've come across another Czech he's
always had to stick his nose into everything find out what's there.
I think, us Czechs, we don't want to believe in anything. So I got
it into my stupid, old head that I should go and get a closer look at
these demons. True, I was drunk at the time, but that was only
because I couldn't get these stupid demons out of my mind. Down
there on the equator, lad, down there anything's possible. So that
evening I went down and had a look at Devil Bay...." Mister Bondy
did his best to imagine a bay in the tropics, surrounded by cliffs
and jungle.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"So there I was sitting by the bay and going ts-ts-ts so that the
demons would come. And then, lad, after a while, a kind of lizard
crawled up out of the water. It stood up on its hind legs, twisting
its whole body. And it went ts-ts-ts at me. If I hadn't been drunk
I probably would have shot it; but, my friend, I was sloshed as an
Englishman, so I said to it, come here, hey you tapa-boy come here, I
won't harm you."</p>

<p>"Were you speaking to it in Czech?"</p>

<p>"No, Malay. That's what they speak most down there, lad. He did
nothing, just made a few steps here and there and looked sideways at
me like a child that's too shy to talk. And all around in the water
were a couple of hundred of these lizards, poking their paws up out
of the water and watching me. So I, well yes I was drunk, I squatted
down and began to twist about like these lizards so that they
wouldn't be afraid of me. Then another lizard crawled out of the
water, about the size of a ten year old boy, and he started waddling
about too. And in his front paw he had an oyster." The captain took
a draught of beer. "Cheers, Mister Bondy. Well it's true that I was
very drunk, so I said to him, what a clever lad you are, eh, what is
it you want then? Want me to open that oyster for you, do you? Come
here then, I can open it with my knife. But he just stood there,
still didn't dare come any closer. So once again, I started to twist
about like I was a shy little girl. Then he pattered up closer to
me, I slowly held out my hand to him and took the oyster from his
paw. Now, you can understand we were both a bit afraid, but I was
drunk. So I took my knife and opened that oyster; I felt inside to
see if there was a pearl there but there wasn't, only that vile snot,
like one of those slimy molluscs that live in those shells. Alright
then, I said, ts-ts-ts, you can eat it if you like. And I tossed the
open oyster over to him. You should have seen how he licked it up,
lad. It must have been a wonderful titbit for these lizards. Only,
the poor animals weren't able to get into the hard shells with their
little fingers. Life is hard, ja!" The captain took another drink
of beer. "So I worked it out in my head, lad. When these lizards
saw how the Sinhalese cut away the oysters they must have said to
themselves, aha, so they eat oysters, and they wanted to see how
these Sinhalese would open them. One of these Sinhalese looks pretty
much like a lizard when he's in the water, but one of these lizards
was more clever than a Sinhalese or a Batak because he wanted to
learn something. And a Batak will never want to learn anything
unless it's how to thieve something," Captain J. van Toch added in
disgust. "So when I was on that shore going ts-ts-ts and twisting
about like a lizard they must have thought to themselves that I'm
some kind of great-big salamander. That's why they weren't really
scared of me and came closer, so that I would open the oysters for
them. That's how intelligent and trusting these animals are."
Captain van Toch went red. "When I'd got to know them better I took
all my clothes off, so that I'd look more like them, naked; but they
were still puzzled at the hairs on my chest and that sort of thing.
Ja." The captain wiped his handkerchief over his blushing neck.
"But I hope I'm not boring you, Mister Bondy." G.H. Bondy was
enchanted.</p>

<p>"No, no. Not at all. Please carry on, Captain."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes alright then. So when this lizard had licked out the
shell with all the others watching him they climbed up onto the
shore. Some of them even had oysters in their paws--something odd
about this, lad, is that they were able to pull them off the cliffs
when they only had these little fingers without a thumb, like a
child's fingers. At first they were too shy, but then they let me
take the oyster out of their hands. True, they weren't proper
oysters with pearls in them, all sorts of things it was they brought
me, the sort of clams and the like that don't have pearls in them,
but I threw them back in the water and told them, that's no good
children, they're not worth opening, I'm not going to use my knife on
them. But when they brought me a pearl-oyster I opened it with my
knife and checked carefully to see if there wasn't a pearl there.
Then I gave it back to them for them to lick it out. So by then
there was a couple of hundred of these lizards sitting round me and
watching to see how it was I opened the oysters. Some of them tried
to do it themselves, tried to cut round the oyster with the bits of
shell that were lying around. I found that very strange, lad. No
animal knows how to use tools; all that an animal knows is what's
been shown to it by nature. I admit, I once saw in Buitenzorg a
monkey that could open a tin can with a knife; but a monkey, that s
not really a proper animal. But I did find it strange." The captain
took a drink of beer. "That night, Mister Bondy, I found about
eighteen pearls in those shells. Some of them were small and some
were bigger and three of them were as big as the stone in a peach,
Mister Bondy, as big as the stone in a peach." Captain van Toch
nodded his head earnestly. "After I'd got back to my ship in the
morning I said to myself, Captain van Toch, sir, it was all just
dream, you were drunk, and so on. But I couldn't believe what I told
myself, not when I had eighteen pearls in my pocket. Ja."</p>

<p>"That is the best story I've ever heard," said Mister Bondy, with
a sigh. Captain van Toch was pleased at this and said,</p>

<p>"There, you see, lad. I thought about what had happened all that
day. I would tame these lizards, wouldn't I. Ja. Tame them and
train them to bring me these pearl oysters. There must have been an
enormous number of them down there in Devil Bay. So that evening I
went down again, but a bit earlier. When the Sun began to go down
the lizards began to stick their noses out from the water, one here,
then one there, until the water was full of them. I sat on the shore
and went ts-ts-ts. Then I looked and saw a shark, just its fin
poking up from the water. And then there was a lot of splashing and
one of the lizards had had it. I counted twelve of those sharks
cruising into Devil Bay in the sunset. Mister Bondy, in just one
evening those monsters ate more than twenty of my lizards," the
captain exclaimed and blew his nose angrily. "Ja! More than
twenty! It stands to reason, a naked lizard like that with those
little paws, he can't defend himself. It was enough to make you cry
to see a sight like that. You should have seen it, lad..."</p>

<p>The captain stopped and thought for a while. "I'm quite fond of
animals, you see," he said finally, and lifted his blue eyes to G.H.
Bondy. "I don't know what you think of all this, Captain Bondy..."
Mister Bondy nodded to show his agreement, and this pleased Captain
van Toch. "That's alright, then. "They're very good and
intelligent, these tapa-boys; if you tell them something they pay
attention like a dog listening to its master. And most of all, these
little hands they have, like children's hands. You know lad, I'm an
old man and I have no family...Ja, an old man can be very lonely,"
the captain complained as he overcame his emotion. "It's very easy
to become fond of these lizards, for what it's worth. But if only
the sharks didn't keep eating them like that! Then when I went after
them, after those sharks, and I threw stones at them, then they
started throwing stones too, these tapa-boys. You won't believe it,
Mister Bondy. True, they couldn't throw the stones very far because
their hands were so small, but it was all very strange. As you're so
clever, I said to them, you can try and open some of these oysters
yourselves with my knife. So I put the knife down on the ground.
They were a bit shy at first, but then one of them tried it, pushing
the point of the knife between the two halves of the shell. You've
got to lever it open, I told him, lever it, see? Twist the knife
round, like this, and there, that's it. And he kept on trying, poor
thing, until it gave way and the shell opened. There, you see, I
said. Not that hard, is it. If some pagan Batak or Sinhalese can do
it then why shouldn't a tapa-boy do it too, eh? Now, Mister Bondy, I
wasn't going to tell these lizards how it was wonderful, marvellous,
astonishing to see what an animal like that could do, but now I can
tell you that I was...I was...well simply thunderstruck."</p>

<p>"As I can see," answered Mister Bondy.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. As you can see. I was so confused at all
this that I stayed there another day with my ship, and then in the
evening went back to Devil Bay and once more I watched how the sharks
were eating my lizards. That night I swore that I would put an end
to that, lad. I even gave them my word of honour. Tapa-boys, I
said, Captain J. van Toch hereby promises, under the majesty of all
these stars, that I will help you."</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<h4>CAPTAIN VAN TOCH'S BUSINESS</h4>

<p>While Captain van Toch was saying this the hair on the back of his
neck had risen with his anger and excitement. "And so I swore. And
ever since then, lad, I've not had a moments peace. In Padang I took
some leave due to me and sent a hundred and seven pearls to those
Jew-boys in Amsterdam, everything those animals of mine had brought
me. Then I found a kind of lad, Dayak he was, a shark-killer, they
go in the water and kill the sharks with a knife. Terrible thief and
murderer he was, this Dayak. And then with him on a little
tramp-steamer, we went back to Tana Masa, and now, lad, in you go and
kill these sharks with your knife. I wanted him to kill the sharks
so that they'd leave my lizards in peace, but this Dayak was such a
cut-throat and pagan he didn't do a thing, not even for those
tapa-boys. He didn't give a damn about the job. And all this time I
was making my own observations and experiments with these lizards--
just a minute, I've got a ships logbook here where I noted everything
down every day." The captain drew a voluminous set of notes out from
his breast pocket and began to leaf through them. "What's the date
today? I know, the twenty-fifth of June. Now, the twenty-fifth June
for instance--last year, this was--I was here and the Dayak was out
killing sharks. These lizards have a real big liking for carrion.
Toby--that was one of the lizards, a smallish one, clever though,"
explained the captain. "I had to give them some sort of a name,
didn't I, so that I could write about them in this book. So, Toby
pushed his fingers into the hole the knife had left. Evening, they
brought a dry branch for my fire. No, that's nothing," the captain
grumbled. "I'll find another day. Lets say, the twentieth of June,
shall we? The lizards continued building their jetty. This was some
kind of dam. They were building a new dam at the north-western end
of Devil Bay. And this was a fantastic piece of work, lad," the
captain explained, "a proper breakwater. And they brought their eggs
down to this side of it where the water would be quiet. They thought
it up all by themselves, this dam; and I can tell you, no clerk or
engineer from Waterstaat in Amsterdam could have made a better plan
for a submerged breakwater than they did. An amazingly skilled piece
of work. And they dug out, sort of, deep holes in the banks under
the water and lived in them during the day. Amazingly clever
animals, just like beavers, those great big mice that build dams on a
river. And they had a lot of these dams in Devil Bay, big ones and
small ones, lovely smooth and level dams, it looked like a city. In
the end they wanted to put a dam right across the whole of Devil
Bay. That's how it was. They can now lift boulders with a lever, "
he read on. " Albert--that was one of the tapa-boys--crushed two
of his fingers. Twenty-first: The Dayak ate Albert! But it made
him ill. Fifteen drops of opium. Promised not to do it again. Rain
all day. Thirtieth of June: Lizards finished building dam. Toby did
not want to work. Now, he was clever, Toby," the captain explained
with admiration. "The clever ones never want to do anything. He was
always working things out with his hands, this Toby. For what it's
worth, there are big differences between lizards just like between
people. Third of July: Sergeant got the knife. This Sergeant, he
was a big strong lizard. And very clever with it. Seventh of July:
Sergeant used knife to kill a cuttle-fish. Tenth of July: Sergeant
killed big jelly-fish with knife. Strange sort of animal, a
jelly-fish is. Looks like jelly but stings like a nettle. And now,
Mister Bondy, listen to this. I've got it underlined. Sergeant
killed a small shark with the knife. Seventy pounds weight. So
there you see it, Mister Bondy," Captain J. van Toch declared in
triumph. "Here it is in black and white. That was the big day,
lad. To be precise, the thirteenth of July last year." The captain
closed his notes. "I'm not ashamed to admit it, Mister Bondy; I
knelt down on the shore by that Devil Bay and wept for sheer joy. I
knew then that my tapa-boys would not give up. Sergeant got a lovely
new harpoon as a reward--a harpoon is best if you're going to go
hunting sharks, lad--and I said to him, be a man, Sergeant, and show
these tapa-boys they can defend themselves. And do you know," here
the captain raised his voice, jumped up and thumped the table in his
excitement, "within three days there was a dead shark floating in the
bay, horribly mutilated, full of gashes. And all the gashes made by
this harpoon." The captain gulped down some more beer. "That's just
how it was, Mister Bondy. It was then that I made a kind of a
contract with these tapa-boys. That is, I gave them my word that if
they would bring me these pearl oysters then I would give them these
harpoons and knives for them to defend themselves, see? That's fair
business. Whatever he does, a man should be honest even to animals
like these. And I gave them some wood too, and two iron wheelbarrows
for them to carry the stones for the dam. And the poor things had to
pull everything in those tiny hands of theirs. Terrible for them,
that's how it was. And I wouldn't have wanted to cheat them. Hold
on, lad, I'll show you something." Captain van Toch lifted his belly
with one hand and with the other pulled a canvas bag out of his
trouser pocket. "Look what I've got here," he said, and emptied it
out onto the table. There was a thousand pearls there of all
different sizes: some as small as a seed, some the size of a pea and
some of them were the size of a cherry; perfectly round pearls, lumpy
and irregular pearls, silvery pearls, blue pearls, yellowish pearls
like persons skin and pearls of all colours from black to pink. G.H.
Bondy's jaw dropped; he could not help himself and had to touch them,
roll them around in the tips of his fingers, cover them in both his
hands.</p>

<p>"These are beautiful," he sighed in wonder and amazement.
"Captain, this is like a dream!"</p>

<p>"Ja," said the captain without emotion. "They are nice. And that
year that I was down there they killed about thirty of those sharks.
I've got it written down here," he said, tapping on his breast
pocket. "And all with the knives I'd given them, them and the five
harpoons. Those knives cost me nearly two American dollars a piece.
Very good knives, lad, stainless steel, won't go rusty in the water,
not even sea water. And those Bataks cost me a lot of money
too.</p>

<p>"What Bataks?"</p>

<p>"Those native Bataks on that island. They think the tapa-boys are
some kind of demon and they're terribly afraid of them. And when
they saw me talking with these demons of theirs they just wanted to
kill me. All night long they were banging on a kind of gong so that
they would chase the demons away from their village. Made a Hell of
a noise. And then in the morning they wanted me to pay them for it.
For all the work they'd had in doing it. For what it's worth, I can
tell you that these Bataks are terrible thieves. But the tapa-boys,
the lizards, you can do honest business with them. Very good honest
business, Mister Bondy." To Mister Bondy it seemed like he was in a
fairy tale.</p>

<p>"Buying pearls from them?"</p>

<p>"Ja. Only there aren't any pearls left now in Devil Bay, and on
other islands there aren't any tapa-boys. And that's the whole
problem, lad." Captain J. van Toch looked up as if in triumph. "And
that's the big business that I thought out in my head. "Listen lad,"
he said, stabbing the air with his chubby finger, "there's a lot more
of those lizards there now than when I first found them! They can
defend themselves now, you see. Eh? And there are going to be more
and more of them! Now then, Mister Bondy, don't you think this is a
fantastic business opportunity?"</p>

<p>"I still don't quite see," replied G.H. Bondy uncertainly, "what
exactly it is you have in mind, Captain."</p>

<p>"To transport these tapa-boys to other islands where there are
other pearl-fishing grounds," the captain finally exclaimed. I saw
myself how these lizards can't get across the deep and open sea.
They can swim for a little way and they can walk a little way along
the seabed, but where the sea is very deep the pressure there is too
much for them; they're very soft, you see. But if I had some sort
of ship with some kind of tank built into it for them I could take
them wherever I wanted, see? And there they could look for the
pearls and I would follow behind and provide them with the knives and
harpoons and anything else they need. The poor lads increased their
population so much in Devil Bay that they soon won't have enough
there to eat. They eat the smallest of the fish and molluscs, and
those water insects they have there; but they can eat potatoes too,
and rusks and ordinary things like that. So that means they could be
fed while they're in the tanks on the ship. And I could let them out
into the water in suitable places where there aren't many people and
there I could have sort of...sort of farms for these lizards of
mine. And I'd want them to be able to feed themselves, these
animals. They're very likable, Mister Bondy, and very clever too.
And when you see them, lad, you'll say, Hullo Captain, useful animals
you've got here. Ja. And they're mad about pearls now, just like
people. That's the big business I thought up."</p>

<p>All this left G.H. Bondy in some embarrassment and confusion.
"I'm very sorry, Captain," he began hesitantly, "I...I really don't
know..." The clear blue eyes of Captain J. van Toch filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"That is not good, lad. I could leave you all these pearls here
as...as collateral for the ship, but I can't buy the ship all by
myself. I know of a very good ship here in Rotterdam...it's fitted
with a diesel engine..."</p>

<p>"Why did you not suggest this business to someone in Holland?"
The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"I know these people, lad. I can't talk about this sort of thing
with them. They," he said thoughtfully, "would make me carry all
sorts of other things on the ship, and I'd have to sell them all
round these islands. Ja. That's something I could do. I know a lot
of people, Mister Bondy. And at the same time I could have the tanks
on board with my lizards in them..."</p>

<p>"That's something it might well be worth thinking about,"
considered G.H. Bondy. "As it happens, you see...Well you see we
need to find new markets for our products, and I was talking about
this with some people not long ago. I would need to buy one or two
ships, one for south America and the other for these eastern places
..." The captain became more lively.</p>

<p>"That's very wise of you, Mister Bondy. Ships are very cheap
right now, you could buy a whole harbour full of them..." The
captain launched into a deep and technical explanation of what
vessels are for sale where and at what prices and boats and
tank-steamers; G.H. Bondy did not listen to him but merely watched;
G.H. Bondy was a good judge of character. He had not taken Captain
van Toch's story about the lizards seriously for one moment; but the
captain himself was somebody worth taking seriously. Honest, yes.
And he knew his way around down there. Mad, obviously. But very
likeable. All this struck a chord in G.H. Bondy's heart and chimed
with his love of fantasy. Ships carrying pearls and coffee, ships
with spices and all the scents of Arabia. There was a particular,
indescribable feeling that G.H. Bondy had before each major and
successful decision he made; a sensation which might have been
expressed in words thus: It's true I don't really know why, but I
think I'll go along with this. He had this feeling now. Meanwhile
Captain van Toch was waving his enormous hands in the air to outline
ships with awning decks or quarter decks, fantastic ships, lad
...</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Captain Vantoch," G.H. Bondy suddenly said,
"come back here in two weeks time. We can talk about this ship again
then." Captain van Toch understood just how much these words meant.
He blushed in happiness and said,</p>

<p>"And what about the lizards, can I take them on my ship too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Only please don't mention them to anyone.
People would think you've gone mad--and so would I."</p>

<p>"And can I leave these pearls here with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you want to."</p>

<p>"Ja, but I'll choose two of the nicest of them that I need to send
off to someone."</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Just a couple of newspaper men I know, lad. Oh Hell, wait a
minute."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What the Hell were their names?" Captain van Toch blinked his
blue eyes thoughtfully. "This head of mine is so stupid, lad. I've
completely forgotten what those two lads were called."</p>

<h4>HOW CAPTAIN J. VAN TOCH TRAINED THE LIZARDS</h4>

<p>"Well I'm blowed," said a man in Marseille. "It's Jensen, isn't
it?" Jensen, the Swede, raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said, "and don't say a word until I've placed you." He
put his hand to his brow. "The Seagull, wasn't it? No. Empress of
India? No. Pernambuco? No. I've got it. Vancouver. Five years
ago on the Vancouver, Osaka Line, Frisco. And your name is Dingle,
you rascal, Irish." The man grinned and exposed his yellow teeth as
he sat down to join Jensen.</p>

<p>"Dat's right, Jensen. And if there's a drink goin I'll have it,
whatever it is. What brings you to dese parts?" Jensen nodded
toward the dock.</p>

<p>"I do the Marseille to Saigon route these days. And you?"</p>

<p>"I'm on leave," said Dingle with a swagger. "I'm on me way home
to see how many children I've got now." Jensen nodded his head
earnestly.</p>

<p>"So they sacked you again, did they? Drunk on duty were you? If
you went to the YMCA like I do then..." Dingle grinned
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Dey've got a YMCA here, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Today is Saturday," Jensen grumbled. "And where have you been
sailing?"</p>

<p>"On a kind of a tramp steamer," said Dingle evasively. "All the
islands you can tink of down under."</p>

<p>"Captain?"</p>

<p>"Some fella called van Toch. Dutchman or sometin." Jensen the
Swede became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Captain van Toch. I have travelled with him also, brother, some
years back. Ship: the Kandong Bandoeng. Line: from demon to Devil.
Fat, bald and able to swear in Malay for better effect. I know him
well."</p>

<p>"Was he already such a lunatic in dem days?" The Swede shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Old man Toch is all right."</p>

<p>"And had he started carrying dem lizards of his about wid him by
den?"</p>

<p>"No." Jensen thought for a while. "I heard something about that
...in Singapore. Someone was talking all that rubbish there." The
Irishman seemed somewhat offended.</p>

<p>"Dat is not rubbish, Jensen. Dat's de holy truth about dese
lizards."</p>

<p>"This man in Singapore, he said it was true as well," the Swede
grumbled. "So I gave him a smack in the teeth," he added in
triumph.</p>

<p>"Well just you listen to me," Dingle defended himself. "I ought
to know about dese tings, cause I've seen dese brutes wid me own
eyes."</p>

<p>"So have I," mumbled Jensen. "Almost black, with a tail about six
feet long, and they run about on two feet. I know."</p>

<p>"Hideous brutes," shuddered Dingle. "Notting but warts. Holy
Mary, I wouldn't touch em for anyting. And I'm sure dey must be
poisonous and all!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" grumbled the Swede. "Listen. I served once on a ship
that was full of people. All over the upper deck and the lower deck,
nothing but people, full of women and all that sort of thing, dancing
and playing cards. I was the stoker there, see. And now you tell
me, you idiot, which do you think is more poisonous?"</p>

<p>Dingle spat. "Well if it's Caymans you're talking about, den I
won't say notting against you. There was one time I was takin a
shipload of snakes to a zoo, from Bandjarmasin they were, and God how
they stank! But dese lizards, Jensen, dese are some very strange
animals were talkin about. All through the day they stay in that
tank o water o theirs; but in the night they climb up out of it--
tip-tap tip-tap tip-tap--and the whole ship was crawlin wid em.
Stood up on their hind legs, they did, twistin their heads round to
get a good look at you..." The Irishman crossed himself. "And
they'd go ts-ts-ts at you, just like dem whores in Hong Kong. God
forgive me, but I tink there's sometin funny going on there. If it
wasn't so hard to get a job I wouldn't have stayed there a minute,
Jens. Not one minute."</p>

<p>"Aha," said Jensen. "So that is why you are running home to your
mummy, is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, dat's part of it. Just to stay there at all a fella had to
keep drinking a Hell of a lot, and you know the captains got a ting
about that. And the funny ting is, they say that one day I kicked
one o the horrors. D'ye hear dat, kicked one o dem, and kicked it so
hard that I broke its spine. You should have seen how the captain
went on about it; he turned blue, lifted me up by the neck and he
would have thrown me overboard into the water if Gregory, the mate,
hadn't been there. D'ye know Gregory?" The Swede merely nodded.
"That's enough now, Captain, says the mate, and he pours a bucket of
water over me head. So in Kokopo I went on shore." Mister Dingle
spat in a long, flat curve. "The old man cares more about dem vermin
then he does about people. D'ye know he taught em how to speak? On
my soul, he used to shut himself in wid em and spend hours talking to
them. I tink he's trainin em for a circus or sometin. But the
strangest ting of all is that then he lets them out into the water.
He'd weigh anchor by some pathetic little island, take a boat out to
the shore and check how deep it is there; then he'd come back to
these tanks, open the hatch in the side o the ship and let these
vermin out into the water. And you should see them jumpin out
through this hatch one after the other like trained seals, ten or
twenty o them. Then in the night old Toch would row out to the shore
again with some kind o crates. And no-one was ever allowed to know
what was in them. Then we'd sail on again somewhere else. So that's
how it is wid old Toch, Jens. Very strange. Very, very strange."
Mister Dingle's eyes lost their sparkle. "Almighty God, Jens, it
gave me the creeps! And I drank, Jens, drank like a lunatic; and in
the night, when there was this tip-tappin all over the ship, and you
could hear them going ts-ts-ts, sometimes I'd tink it was just
because of the drink. I'd already had that once in Frisco, well you
already know about that, don't you Jensen; only in them days it was
just millions of spiders I saw. De-li-rium, the doctors called it in
the sailor-hospital. Well, I don't know. But then I asked Big Bing
about it, whether he'd been seein tings in the night and all, and he
said he had been. Said he'd seen them wid his own eyes how one o
these lizards turned the handle on the door and went into the
captains cabin. Well, I don't know; this Joe, he was a Hell of a
drinker and all. What do you tink, Jens, do you tink Bing had this
de-lirium too? What do you tink?" Jensen the Swede merely shrugged
his shoulders. "And dat German fella, Peters, he said that when they
rowed the captain down to the shore in the Manihiki Islands they hid
behind some boulders and watched what the old man was doing wid dem
crates of his. Now he says them lizards opened the crates all by
themselves, that the old man gave them the chisel to do it with. And
d'you know what was in them crates? Knives, he said. Great big long
knives and harpoons and that sort o ting. Now I don't believe a
word of what Peters said meself cause he has to wear them glasses on
his nose, but it's very strange all the same. Now what do you tink
of all this?"</p>

<p>The veins on Jensen's brow bulged. "What I think of this," he
growled, "is that this German of yours in sticking his nose into
things that are none of his business, understand? And I can tell you
I don't think that's wise of him."</p>

<p>"You'd better write and tell him, then," smirked the Irishman.
"The safest address to write to would be Hell, you can get hold of
him there. And d'you know what it is that I find strange about all o
dis? That old Toch goes and visits those lizards of his now and
then, down in whatever place he's set them down in. 'Pon my soul,
Jens. He has himself put down on shore in de middle o de night and
doesn't come back till mornin. Now you tell me, Jensen, what is it
he goes down there for? And you tell me, what is it he's got in dem
parcels he sends off to Europe? Parcels as big as this, look, and he
has them insured for up to a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked the Swede, scowling even more.</p>

<p>"A fella knows what he knows," replied Mister Dingle evasively.
"And do you know where old Toch got dese lizards from? From Devil
Bay. Now there's a fella I know down there, an agent he is, and an
educated man, like, and he told me that dese tings are not trained
lizards. Nottin o de sort. And if anyone says dese are nottin more
than animals you can go and tell dat to the fairies. And don't let
anyone tell you otherwise, lad." Mister Dingle gave a significant
wink. "Dat's how it is, Jensen, just so's you know. And are you
gonna tell me now that Captain van Toch is alright?"</p>

<p>"Say that again," grunted the big Swede threateningly.</p>

<p>"If old man Toch was alright he wouldn't be carrying demons round
the world wid him...and he wouldn't be settlin em down in all the
islands he can find like lice in a fur coat. Listen, just in the
time that I was on board wid him he must have settled a good couple o
thousand o them. The old mans sold his soul, man. And I know what
it is that these devils are givin him for it. Rubies and pearls and
all o that sort o ting. And you can well believe he wouldn't be doin
it for nottin."</p>

<p>Jens Jensen turned a deep red. "And what business is it of
yours?" he yelled, slamming his hand down on the table. "You mind
your own damned business!" Little Dingle jumped back in alarm.</p>

<p>"Please," he stuttered in confusion, "what's suddenly...I was
only telling you what it was I'd seen. And if you like,...it was
just the impression I got. This is you, Jensen, I can tell you it's
all just delirium if dat's what you want. You needn't get cross wid
me like dat, Jensen. I've already had that meself once in Frisco,
you know about that. Serious case it was, that's what the doctors in
the sailor-hospital said. You have me word of honour I saw these
lizards or demons or whatever they were. But maybe there weren't
any."</p>

<p>"You did see them, Pat," said the Swede gloomily. "I saw them
too."</p>

<p>"No Jens," answered Dingle, "you were just delirious. He's all
right, old man Toch, only he shouldn't be carryin demons about all
round the world. Tell you what, once I get back home I'll have a
mass said for the good of his soul. Hang me if I don't."</p>

<p>"We don't do that in our faith," said Jensen, deep in thought and
quieter now. "And do you really think it would help someone to have
a mass said for him?"</p>

<p>"Enormous help," exclaimed the Irishman. "I've heard of lots of
cases in Ireland when it's been of help, even in the most serious
cases. Even when it's involved demons and the like."</p>

<p>"Then I shall also have a Catholic mass said for him," Jens Jensen
decided. "Only I'll have it done here in Marseille. I think they'll
do it cheaper in the big church here, factory prices."</p>

<p>"You could be right there, but an Irish mass is better. You see,
in Ireland they've got these priests that really can work magic.
Just like some fakir or pagan."</p>

<p>"Listen Pat," said Jensen, "I would give you twelve francs for
this mass here and now. But you are riff-raff, brother; you would
just drink it."</p>

<p>"Now Jens, man, d'ye tink I'd take a sin like dat on meself? But
listen, just so that you'll believe me I'll write you out an IOU for
that twelve francs, will that do you?"</p>

<p>"That would be all right," thought the Swede, who liked to see
things done properly. Mister Dingle borrowed a pen and a piece of
paper and laid it out flat on the table.</p>

<p>"Now what am I to write down here?" Jens Jensen looked over the
Irishman's shoulder.</p>

<p>"So write down at the top that this is a receipt." And Mister
Dingle, slowly and with his slimey tongue protruding from his mouth
with the effort of it, wrote:</p>

<p>RECEET</p>

<p>I CONFERM THAT I HAVE RECEEVED FROM<br />
JENS JENSEN THE SOM OF 12 FRANCS FOR<br />
A MASS FOR THE SOUL OF CAPTAIN TOCH</p>

<p>PAT DINGLE</p>

<p>"Is dat all right, like dat?" asked Mister Dingle uncertainly.
"And which of us is going keep dis piece o paper?</p>

<p>"You are of course, you fool," said the Swede. "A receipt is so
that a person won't forget he has been given money."</p>

<p>Mister Dingle drank those twelve francs away in Le Havre. He
also, instead of going to Ireland, sailed off down to Djibouti; in
short, that mass was never said, with the result that no higher power
ever did interfere in the course of the events to follow.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<h4>THE YACHT IN THE LAGOON</h4>

<p>Mister Abe Loeb squinted into the setting sun; he would have like
in some way to express how beautiful it was, but his sweetheart, Li,
alias Miss Lily Valley, whose real name was Miss Lilian Nowak and who
was known in short as golden-haired Li, White Lily, Lily Longlegs and
all the other names she had been called during her seventeen years,
slept on the warm sand, nestled in a fluffy bathing gown and curled
up like a sleeping dog. That is why Abe said nothing about the
beauty of the world and merely sighed, scratching his naked feet
because there was sand on them. Out there on the ocean was the yacht
named after Gloria Pickford; Abe had been given the yacht by his
father for passing his university entrance exam. His father was a
great guy. Jesse Loeb, film magnate and so on. Abe, said the old
man, go and get to know something of the world and take a few of your
friends with you. Jesse Loeb was a truly great guy. Gloria Pickford
lay out there on the pearly waters and next to him, in the warm sand,
lay his sweetheart, Li. Abe sighed with happiness. She was sleeping
like a little child, poor thing. Abe felt a yearning to protect her
somehow. I really ought to marry her, thought the young Mister Loeb
to himself, and as he did so he was tortured with the beautiful
feeling in his heart that comes when a firm decision is mixed with
fear. Mamma Loeb would be unlikely to agree to it and Papa Loeb made
decisions with his hands: You're crazy, Abe. His parents would be
unable to understand it, and that was all there was to it. And
Mister Abe, sighing with tenderness, covered the white ankle of his
sweetheart with the tip of her bathing gown. How come I've got such
hairy feet? he thought, absent mindedly.</p>

<p>God it's beautiful here, so beautiful. It's a shame that Li can't
see it. Mister Abe looked at her charming outline, and through some
vague association began to thing about art. This was because his
sweetheart, Li, was an artist. A film artist. True, she had never
actually been in any films, but she was quite certain she would
become the greatest film actress ever; and when Li was certain of
something that was what happened. That was what Mamma Loeb couldn't
understand; an artist is simply an artist, and she can't be like
other girls. And anyway, other girls were no better than she was,
Mister Abe decided; that Judy on the yacht, for instance, a rich girl
like her--and Abe knew that Fred went into her cabin. Every night,
in fact. Whereas Li and I...well Li just isn't like that. I want
Baseball Fred to have the best, Abe thought generously, he's a friend
from university, but every night...a rich girl like her oughtn't to
do that. I think that a girl from a family like Judy's...and Judy
isn't even an artist. (That's what these girls sometimes gossip
about, Abe remembered; with their eyes shining, and giggling...I
never talk about that sort of thing with Fred.) (Li oughtn't to
drink so many cocktails, she never knows what she's talking about
afterwards.) (This afternoon, for example, she didn't need to...)
(I think she and Judy were arguing about who has nicer legs. Why, it
clearly has to be Li. I know these things.) (And Fred didn't have
to have that dumb idea about a beautiful legs contest. They might do
that kind of thing on Palm Beach, but not in private company. And
the girls didn't have to lift their skirts so high. That was more
than just legs. At least, Li didn't have to. And right there in
front of Fred! And a rich girl like Judy didn't have to do it
either.) (Maybe I oughtn't to have called the captain over to be the
judge. That was dumb of me. The captain went so red, and his
mustache stuck out, and he excused himself and slammed the door.
Awful. Just awful. The captain didn't have to be so coarse about
it. And anyway, it's my yacht, isn't it?) (True, the captain
doesn't have a sweetheart with him on board; so how's he going to
look on that sort of thing, poor man? Seeing as he's got no choice
but to be alone, I mean.) (And why did Li cry when Fred said Judy
has nice legs? And then she said Fred was a brute, that he was
spoiling the whole trip...Poor Li!) (And now the girls aren't
talking to each other. And when I wanted to talk to Fred Judy called
him over like a dog. Fred is my best friend after all. And if he's
Judy's lover of course he's going to say she has nicer legs! True,
he didn't have to be so emphatic about it. That wasn't very tactful
towards poor Li; Li is right when she says Fred is a self centered
brute. A heck of a brute.) (I really didn't think the trip was
going to turn out like this. Devil take that Fred!)</p>

<p>Mister Abe realised that he was no longer looking blissfully out
at the pearly ocean, but that he was scowling, scowling very hard.
He was anxious and no longer in a good mood. Go out and see
something of the world, Papa Loeb had said. Well have we seen
something of the world? Mister Abe tried hard to remember what
exactly it was he had seen, but he wasn't able to remember anything
except how Judy and Li, his sweetheart, had shown their legs to Fred,
big shouldered Fred, squatting down in front of them. Abe scowled
even harder. What's this coral island called anyway? Taraiva, the
captain had said. Taraiva, or Tahuara or Taraihatuara-ta-huara. How
about if we go back now, and I can say to old Jesse; Dad, we've been
to Taraihatuara-ta-huara. (If only I hadn't called the captain over,
Mister Abe frowned.) (I have to talk to Li so that she won't do that
sort of thing. God, why do I love her so much! I'll talk to her as
soon as she wakes up. I'll tell her we ought to get married...)
Mister Abe's eyes were full of tears; oh God, is this love or pain,
or is this endless pain just part of me being in love with her?</p>

<p>Sweetheart Li's eyes, made up in blue like a tender shell,
fluttered. "Abe," she called sleepily, "know what I've been
thinking? I've been thinking that on this island you could make a
fan-tas-tic film." Mister Abe sprinkled fine sand over his
unfortunately hairy feet.</p>

<p>"Excellent idea, sweetheart. And what sort of film?" Sweetheart
Li opened her boundless blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Well how about...Imagine I was stuck on this island like
Robinson Crusoe. A female Robinson Crusoe. Don't you think that's a
great new idea?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Mister Abe uncertainly. "And how would you have
gotten onto this island?"</p>

<p>"Easy," came her sweet reply. "Our yacht would just have been
shipwrecked in a storm, and all of you would have been drowned, you
and Judy and the captain and everyone."</p>

<p>"And how about Fred? Fred's a very strong swimmer." Li's smooth
brow became furrowed.</p>

<p>"In that case, Fred will have to be eaten by a shark. That'd be a
great piece of detail," said Abe's sweetheart, clapping her hands as
she did so. "And Fred has a really beautiful body for it, don't you
think?" Mister Abe sighed.</p>

<p>"And what happens after that?"</p>

<p>"And then I'd be thrown unconscious onto the shore by a big wave.
I'd be wearing those pyjamas, the ones with the blue stripes you
liked so much the other day." She narrowed her eyes and looked at
him in the tender way she had seen used to depict female
seductiveness. "And the film really needs to be in color, Abe.
Everyone says how much the color blue goes with my hair."</p>

<p>"And who would find you here?" asked Mister Abe objectively." His
sweetheart thought for a while.</p>

<p>"No-one. I wouldn't be a Robinson Crusoe if there were people
here," she said with a surprising grasp of logic. That's what would
make it such a great role, because I'd always be on my own. Just
imagine it, Abe, Lily Valley in the title role and only role!"</p>

<p>"And what would you be doing all through the film?" Li leant up
on her elbow.</p>

<p>"I've got that all thought out. I'd swim in the lagoon and I'd
climb up on the rocks and sing."</p>

<p>"In your pyjamas?"</p>

<p>"Without my pyjamas," said Abe's sweetheart. "Don't you think
that'd be a great success?"</p>

<p>"Well you can't do the whole film naked," grumbled Abe, who felt
strongly opposed to the idea.</p>

<p>"Why not?" answered his sweetheart in innocent surprise. "Who'd
be there to see me?" Mister Abe said something that could not be
properly heard. "And then," Li considered, "and then...I've got
it. Then I'd be captured by a gorilla, you know? A gorilla that's
really big and black and hairy." Mister Abe went red, and tried to
hide his damned hairy feet even deeper in the sand.</p>

<p>"They don't have any gorillas on this island," he objected, not
very convincingly.</p>

<p>"Yes they do. They've got every possible kind of animal here.
You have to look at it scientifically, Abe. And a gorilla would go
so well with my complexion. Have you noticed how Judy has hairs on
her legs?"</p>

<p>"No," said Abe, somewhat displeased at this change of subject.</p>

<p>"Awful legs," thought Abe's sweetheart as she looked down at her
own. "And as the gorilla carries me away in its arms a young and
handsome wild man would come out of the jungle and knock it
down."</p>

<p>"How would he be dressed?"</p>

<p>"He'd have a bow and arrow," was his sweethearts unhesitating
reply, "and a wreath on his head. And this wild man would pick me up
and take me to the cannibals' campfire."</p>

<p>"There aren't any cannibals here," said Abe in defence of the
island of Tahuara.</p>

<p>"There are too! And the cannibals would want to sacrifice me to
their idols and they'd be singing like they do in Hawaii, you know,
like those negroes in the Paradise Restaurant. But one of the young
cannibals would fall in love with me," sighed Abe's sweetheart, her
eyes wide open in amazement, "and then another of the savages would
fall in love with me, it could be the cannibal chief this time, and
then a white man..."</p>

<p>"Where did this white man come from?" asked Abe, just to be
sure.</p>

<p>"Hell have been there from the start. He could be a famous tenor
who's fallen into the savages clutches. That's so that he can sing
in the film."</p>

<p>"And what would he be wearing?" Abe's sweetheart looked at her
big to.</p>

<p>"He should be...he should be naked, just like the cannibals."
Mister Abe shook his head.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, that wouldn't work. Famous tenors are always
horribly fat."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's such a shame," lamented Abe's sweetheart. "Maybe Fred
could play that part and then the tenor could just do the singing,
you know how they do that dubbing in films."</p>

<p>"But Fred was eaten by a shark!" Abe's sweetheart frowned.</p>

<p>"You don't need to be so realistic all the time, Abe. I just
can't talk about art with you. And then this king of the cannibals
would put strings and strings of pearls around my neck..."</p>

<p>"Where does he get them from?"</p>

<p>"Why there's lots of pearls here," Li insisted. "And then Fred
gets jealous and boxes with him on the rocks overlooking the sea as
it crashes on shore. Don't you think Fred would have a fantastic
silhouette against the sky? Isn't that a great idea? And then the
two of them would fall into the sea..." This thought cheered Abe up
slightly. "And then you could have that detail with the shark.
Think how mad it would make Judy if Fred played in a film with me!
And I'd get married to this beautiful wild man." The golden-haired
Li jumped up from where she lay. "I'd be standing here on the shore
like this, outlined against the setting sun, entirely naked, and the
film would slowly come to a close." Li threw off her bathing gown.
"And now I'm going to go for a swim."</p>

<p>"...You haven't got your bathing suit," pointed out Abe in alarm,
looking out to the yacht to see if anyone was watching; but Li, his
sweetheart, was already dancing across the sand to the lagoon.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Abe heard a voice: "Actually, she does look better with
her clothes on." The voice was brutally cool and critical. Abe felt
crushed at his lack of erotic admiration, he even felt almost guilty
about it. But, well, when Li is wearing her clothes and stockings
she does, well, seem more beautiful somehow. In his own defence, Abe
considered that what he meant was more decent. Well, that as well.
And nicer. And why's she running like that? And why do her thighs
wobble like that? And why...Stop this! Abe told himself in
horror. Li is the most beautiful girl that ever lived. And I'm
terribly in love with her. "Even when she's got nothing on?" asked
the cool and critical voice. Abe turned his eyes away and looked at
the yacht in the lagoon. It was so beautiful, every line was
perfect! It's a shame that Fred isn't here. If Fred were here we
could talk about how beautiful the yacht is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Abe's sweetheart had reached the water and was standing
in it up to her knees, her arms were stretched out to the setting Sun
and she was singing. She can go and swim in Hell, thought Abe in
irritation. But it had been nice while she was lying there curled up
in a ball, wrapped in her bathing gown and with her eyes closed.
Dear Li. And with a touching sigh, Abe kissed the sleeve of her
bathing gown. Yes, he was terribly in love with her. So much in
love it hurt.</p>

<p>There was a sudden, piercing scream from the lagoon. Abe lifted
himself up on his elbow so that he could see better. Li, his
sweetheart, was screaming, waving her arms in the air and rushing
through the water to the shore, floundering and splashing water all
around. Abe jumped up and ran to her. "What is it, Li?" (Look at
that stupid way she runs, the cool and critical voice remarked. She
throws her legs about. She flaps her arms about. It just isn't
nice. And she's even squawking as she does it, yes, she squawks.)
"What's happened, Li?" called Abe as he ran to her assistance.</p>

<p>"Abe, Abe," squawked his sweetheart, and all of a sudden she was
there hanging, cold and wet, around his neck. "Abe there's some kind
of animal out there!"</p>

<p>"Why that's nothing," laughed Abe. "It must be some kind of
fish."</p>

<p>"Not with an awful head like that," his sweetheart howled, and
pressed her wet nose against Abe's breast. Abe wanted to pat her on
the shoulder like a father, but on her wet body it would have sounded
more like a slap.</p>

<p>"Alright, alright," he muttered, "look out there, there's nothing
there any more." Li looked out to the lagoon.</p>

<p>"It was awful," she sighed, then suddenly started to howl again.
"There, there, you see it?" There was the black head of something
above the water slowly coming in to shore, its mouth opening and
closing. Abe's sweetheart Li screamed hysterically and set off in
desperate flight away from the water.</p>

<p>Abe did not know what he should do. Should he run after Li so
that she would not be so afraid? Or should he stay where he was to
show that he had no fear of this animal himself? He chose, of
course, the second option; strode towards the sea until he was up to
his ankles in water and, his fists clenched, looked the creature in
the eye. The black head stopped coming closer, it swayed oddly, and
said: Ts-ts-ts. Abe was somewhat uneasy about this, but he could not
possibly let it be seen. "What is it you want?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts," the head replied.</p>

<p>"Abe, Abe, A-a-abe," sweetheart Li shrieked.</p>

<p>"I'm coming," Abe replied, and he slowly (so that nobody would get
the wrong idea) went back towards his girl. He stopped and turned to
look severely at the sea. At the waters edge, where the sea never
stops tracing its lacey patterns in the sand, there was some kind of
dark-coloured animal standing on its hind legs. Its head was round
and its body swayed. Abe stood where he was with his heart beating
fast.</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts," said the animal.</p>

<p>"A-a-abe" wailed his sweetheart, close to fainting. Abe walked
backwards, step by step, without letting the animal out of his
sight. The animal did not move but merely turned its head to watch
him. At last, Abe was once more with his sweetheart, who was lying
with her face to the ground and howling and blubbering with the
horror of it.</p>

<p>"It's...it's some kind of seal," said Abe uncertainly. "We
really ought to go back to the ship, Li." But Li merely shuddered.
"There's nothing there to be frightened of," Abe insisted. He wanted
to kneel down beside Li, but it was his duty to stand like a knight
in armour between her and the beast. He wished he were wearing more
than just bathing trunks, or that he had at least something like a
penknife with him, or that he could find a stick.</p>

<p>It was beginning to get dark. The animal came closer again and
stopped about thirty paces away. And behind it were five, six, eight
of the same animal appearing out of the sea and hesitantly, swaying
and tip-tapping, they made their way to where Abe was protecting his
sweetheart, Li. "Don't look, Li," gasped Abe, although this was
quite unnecessary as Li would not have looked for anything in the
world. More of the shadows came out of the sea and formed into a
broad semi-circle. By now there was about sixty of them, Abe
reckoned. That light patch was his sweetheart Li's bathing gown, the
gown she had been asleep in only a short time before. The animals
had come as far as this light patch, which lay carelessly thrown down
on the sand.</p>

<p>Then Abe did something as natural and as nonsensical as the knight
in the Schiller story who went into the lion's cage to fetch his
lady's glove. There are many natural and nonsensical things that men
will keep on doing for as long as the world is still spinning.
Without thinking, and with his head erect and his fists clenched,
Mister Abe Loeb went in among the animals to fetch the bathing gown
belonging to his sweetheart, Li.</p>

<p>The animals stepped back slightly but did not run away. Abe
picked up the gown, threw it over his arm like a toreador and
remained standing where he was. "A-abe," came the desperate whine
from behind him.</p>

<p>Mister Abe felt a sense of boundless strength and nobility. "What
then?" he said to the animals, taking a step closer. "What exactly
is it you want?"</p>

<p>"Ts-ts," hissed one of the animals, and then, in a rasping voice
like an old mans, it barked, "Knife!" The other animals, a little
way away joined in, barking like the first: "Knife, knife,
knife!"</p>

<p>"A-abe!"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Li," Abe called back.</p>

<p>"Li," came a bark from in front of him. "Li." "Li."</p>

<p>"A-a-abe!" To Abe it seemed like he was dreaming.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Knife!"</p>

<p>"A-a-abe!" wailed his sweetheart.  "Come back here!"</p>

<p>"Right away.--I don't have a knife. I'm not going to hurt
you. What is it you want?"</p>

<p>"Ts-ts," hissed another of them as it swayed its way across to
him. Abe stood with his legs apart, the gown still over his arm, but
he did not retreat. "Ts-ts," it said.</p>

<p>"What is it you want?" The animal seemed to be offering Abe its
front paw, but Abe did not like this at all. "What?" he said,
somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"Knife," barked the animal, and dropped something whitish, like a
beads, from its paw. But they were not beads as they rolled across
the sand.</p>

<p>"A-abe," stammered Li. "Don't leave me here!"</p>

<p>By now, Mister Abe was no longer afraid. "Get out of the way," he
said, waving the bathing gown at the animals. The animals made a
sudden and hasty retreat. It would now be possible for Abe to
withdraw with honour, but so that Li would see what courage he had he
stooped down to pick up the white things the animal had dropped from
its paw and see what they were. There were three of them, hard,
smooth and round and with a dull sheen to them. As it was getting
dark, Mister Abe brought them up close to his eyes.</p>

<p>"A-abe," wailed his abandoned sweetheart, "Abe!"</p>

<p>"I'm coming," Mister Abe called back. "Li, I've got something
here for you! Li, Li, I'll bring it right over!" With the bathing
gown whirling above his head, Mister Abe Loeb ran across along the
shore like a young god.</p>

<p>Li was squatting a little way off and shaking. "Abe," she sobbed
as her teeth chattered. "How could you,...how could you..." The
triumphant Abe knelt down in front of her.</p>

<p>"Lily Valley, the gods of the sea, the Tritons, come to pay you
homage. I am to tell you that ever since Venus emerged from the
foaming deep no artist has ever impressed them like you. As proof of
their awe they send you this." Abe held out his hand. "Look, three
pearls."</p>

<p>"Don't talk garbage, Abe," snorted his sweetheart, Li.</p>

<p>"Honest, Li. Take a look, they're genuine pearls!"</p>

<p>"Let me see them," she whined, and with trembling hands reached
out to touch the whitish spheres. "Abe," she gasped, " they really
are pearls! Did you find them in the sand?"</p>

<p>"But Li, Sweetheart, you don't just find pearls in the sand!"</p>

<p>"Yes you do," his sweetheart insisted. "You wash the sand off in
a pan and there they are. Didn't I tell you there must be lots of
pearls round here?"</p>

<p>"Pearls grow in kind of clams under the water," said Abe, almost
sure of himself. "But listen, Li, it was the tritons, they brought
them for you? They must have seen you while you were bathing. They
wanted to give them to personally, but you were so afraid..."</p>

<p>"But they're so ugly," exclaimed Li. "Abe these are wonderful
pearls. I'm really fond of pearls!" (Now she's beautiful, said the
critical voice. Kneeling here in the sand with the pearls on the
palm of her hand...yes, beautiful, it has to be said.) "And those,
those animals, did they really..."</p>

<p>"They're not animals, sweetheart. They're the gods of the sea,
they're called tritons." This did not surprise his sweetheart in the
slightest.</p>

<p>"Why, that's so nice of them. They really are very sweet. What
do you think, Abe, do you think I ought to thank them in some
way."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid of them any more?" Abe's sweetheart
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Yes. Abe, please, get me out of here!"</p>

<p>"Well that means," said Abe, "we've got to get to our boat. Come
with me and don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"But what if...what if they're standing in our way, Abe?"
shuddered Li. "Couldn't you go out there to them on your own? But
you can't leave me here all by myself!"</p>

<p>"I'll carry you in my arms," offered Mister Abe, the hero.</p>

<p>"That would be all right," his sweetheart sighed.</p>

<p>"But put your bathing gown on," grumbled Abe.</p>

<p>"Right away." Miss Li rearranged her famously golden hair with
both hands. "I must look an awful mess! Abe, do you have any
lipstick on you?" Abe lay the bathing gown over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I think it's best just to go, Li!"</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid," gasped his sweetheart. Mister Abe took her up
in his arms. Li thought she was as light as a cloud. Hell, she's
heavier than you thought, isn't she, said the critical voice. And
now you've got both hands full, haven't you; if those animals do come
at us, what then? "Can't you run any faster?" his sweetheart
suggested.</p>

<p>"Sure," gasped Mister Abe, hardly able not to get his legs in a
tangle. By this time it was getting dark very fast. Abe was getting
closer to the broad semi-circle formed by the animals.</p>

<p>"Hurry Abe, faster, faster," whispered Li. The animals began to
sway and gyrate the upper half of their bodies in their peculiar
wave-like way. "Quick, Abe, hurry, faster," his sweetheart whined as
she kicked her legs about hysterically and jagging her
silver-lacquered nails in Abe's neck.</p>

<p>"For Gods sake, Li, give it a rest," Abe muttered.</p>

<p>"Knife," came a barking voice from just beside them.</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Li."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Li."</p>

<p>They had already got past the semi-circle of animals, and Abe felt
he could run no further through the damp sand. "You can put me down,
now," said his sweetheart, just as Abe's legs were about to give
way. He wiped the sweat from his brow as he panted for breath.</p>

<p>"Get into the boat, quick," he ordered his sweetheart. The
semi-circle of dark shapes had turned to face Li and was coming
closer.</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Li."</p>

<p>But Li did not scream. Li did not run away in terror. Li raised
her arms to the sky, the bathing gown slipped off her shoulders, and
naked and with both hands she waved to the swaying forms, blowing
kisses to them as she did. On her trembling lips there appeared
something which could only be called a charming smile. "You're so
sweet," she stuttered in her squeaky voice, and stretched her white
hands out once again to the swaying shadows.</p>

<p>"Come and give me a hand, Li," Abe ordered somewhat sharply as he
pushed the boat out into the water. Sweetheart Li picked up her
bathing gown.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my darlings!" There was a sound of splashing as the
shadows made their way into the water. "So hurry up, Abe," hissed
his sweetheart as she paddled out to the boat. "They've nearly
reached us!" Mister Abe Loeb was making desperate exertions to get
the boat out into the water when sweetheart Li stepped into it to add
to the weight, still fluttering her hand about. "Go over to the
other side, Abe, they can't see me."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts."</p>

<p>"A-abe."</p>

<p>"Knife, ts, knife."         </p>

<p>"Ts-ts."</p>

<p>"Knife!"</p>

<p>At last the boat was bobbing on the waves. Mister Abe clambered
into it and leant with all his strength on the oars. One of the oars
struck against something slippery.</p>

<p>Sweetheart Li made a deep sigh. "Aren't they so sweet? And
wasn't I just perfect?" Mister Abe rowed out to the yacht with all
the strength he had.</p>

<p>"Put your bathing gown on, Li," he replied somewhat drily.</p>

<p>"I think I was a great success," asserted Miss Li. "And those
pearls, Abe, what do you think they're worth?" For a moment, Mister
Abe stopped rowing.</p>

<p>"I think you needn't have shown so much of yourself, sweetheart."
Miss Li felt slightly offended.</p>

<p>"Well what if I did? Anyone can see that you're not an artist,
Abe Loeb. And now, if you don't mind, keep rowing; I'm getting cold
in just this gown!"</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<h4>THE YACHT IN THE LAGOON (continued)</h4>

<div class="section">
<p>On board the Gloria Pickford that evening there were no personal
quarrels, but scientific theories were bandied noisily. Fred
(loyally supported by Abe) judged that it must certainly have been
some kind of lizard, whereas the captain decided on a mammal. There
aren't any lizards in the sea, the captain insisted angrily; but the
young men from the university gave him no credence; and lizards are
somehow more of a sensation. Sweetheart Li contented herself with
the belief that they were tritons, that they were so sweet, and it
was altogether such a success; and (in the blue striped pyjamas that
Abe liked so much) her eyes shone as she dreamt of pearls and of gods
of the sea. Judy, of course, was convinced it was all just humbug
and nonsense and that Li and Abe had thought the whole thing up. She
made furious signs to Fred that he should just leave it. Abe thought
that Li should have told them about how he, Abe, went fearlessly
among these lizards to fetch her bathing gown; which is why he told
them three times about how Li faced them down while he, Abe, pushed
the boat out into the water, and he was about to tell them for a
fourth time except that Fred and the captain were not listening as
they argued passionately about lizards and mammals. (As if it even
mattered what they were, thought Abe.) In the end Judy yawned and
said she was going to bed; she looked meaningfully at Fred, but Fred
had just remembered that before the Flood there were all sorts of
strange and ancient lizards with names like diplosaurus and
bigosaurus or something like that and I can assure you they walked on
their hind legs; Fred had seen them himself in a strange picture in
an educational book as big as this. An amazing book, and it's
something you should see for yourself.</p>

<p>"Abe," came the voice of his sweetheart, Li. "I've got a
fantastic idea for a film."</p>

<p>"What's that, Li?"</p>

<p>"It's something amazingly original. You see, our yacht has sunk
and I'm the only survivor on this island. And I'd live there like a
female Robinson Crusoe."</p>

<p>"And what would you do there?" objected the captain with some
skepticism.</p>

<p>"Well I'd go swimming and that sort of thing," was sweetheart Li's
simple reply. "And then these tritons from the sea would fall in
love with me and they'd bring me lots and lots of pearls. You know,
just like it really happened.  It could even be a nature film or an
educational film, don't you think? Something like Trader Horn."</p>

<p>"Li's right," declared Fred suddenly. "We ought to go down
tomorrow evening and film these lizards."</p>

<p>"These mammals, you mean," the captain corrected him.</p>

<p>"Me, he means," said Li, "as I'm standing among these
tritons."</p>

<p>"But wearing your bathing gown," Abe interjected.</p>

<p>"I would have my white bathing suit on," said Li. "And Greta
would have to do my hair properly. Today I looked just awful."</p>

<p>"Who would do the filming?"</p>

<p>"Abe. So that he has something to do. And Judy would have to
hold the lights if it's already getting dark."</p>

<p>"What about Fred?"</p>

<p>"Fred would be carrying a bow and arrow and have a wreath on his
head, and then if the tritons want to carry me away he can stop
them."</p>

<p>"Well thanks a lot," Fred grinned. "I think I'd rather have a
revolver, though. I think the captain should be there, too." The
captain's military moustache bristled.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about a thing. I'll make sure I do everything
that needs doing."</p>

<p>"Three members of the crew, sir. And properly armed, sir."
Sweetheart Li lit up in charming astonishment.</p>

<p>"Do you really think it's that dangerous, captain?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything, girl," the captain grumbled, "but I have
my orders from Mister Jesse Loeb--at least where Mister Abe is
concerned." All the gentlemen threw themselves into a passionate
discussion of all the details of the undertaking; Abe winked to his
sweetheart, it was already time for her to go to bed. Li obediently
went.</p>

<p>"You know, Abe," she said to him in her cabin "I think this is
going to be a fantastic film!"</p>

<p>"It will be, my love," Mister Abe agreed as he tried to kiss
her.</p>

<p>"Not tonight, Abe," said his love as she pushed him away. "You
must understand that I really have to concentrate."</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Miss Li continued to concentrate all the next day, causing a great
deal of work for her poor maid, Greta. There were bath with
essential salts and essences, washing her hair with Nurblond shampoo,
massage, pedicure, manicure, hairdressing, ironing, trying on and
alterations of clothes, and many other different kinds of
preparation; even Judy was drawn into the bustle and did what she
could do help Li. (At times of difficulty, women can be remarkably
loyal to each other. Dressing is one such time.) While all this
feverish rush was occupying Miss Li's cabin the gentlemen were
fending for themselves, and with ash trays and glasses of strong
drink on the table in front of them they worked out a strategic plan
about who would stand where and who would take care of what if
anything happened; and in the process the captains dignity in the
serious question of who would hold command was injured several
times. In the afternoon the filming equipment was taken down to the
shore of the lagoon, along with a small machine gun, a basket with
food and cutlery, a shotgun, a gramophone and other military
requisites; all of it perfectly concealed under palm leaves. The
three armed members of the crew, with the captain in the function of
commander in chief, were in position well before it began to get
dark, and then an enormous basket containing a few small things Miss
Lily Valley might need was taken to the shore. Then Fred came down
with Miss Judy. And then the Sun began to set in all its tropical
glory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mister Abe was already tapping on the door of Miss Li's
cabin for the tenth time. "Sweetheart, it really is time to go
now!"</p>

<p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," his sweetheart's voice replied, "but
please don't make me nervous! I have to get myself ready, don't
I?"</p>

<p>The captain had his eye on the situation. Out on of the bay he
could see a long, glittering band where the waves of the sea met the
smooth and level surface of the lagoon. It's as if there were some
kind of weir or breakwater under the water there, he thought; it
could be sand, or a coral reef, but it looks almost as if it were
artificial. Strange place. Here and there on the peaceful surface
of the lagoon a black head would appear and make its way to the
shore. The captain pursed his lips and reached uneasily for his
revolver. It would have been better, he thought, if the women had
stayed on board the yacht. Judy began to shiver and held tightly
onto Fred. He's so strong, she thought, God I love him so much!</p>

<p>Eventually the last boat set out from the yacht. It contained
Miss Lily Valley in a white bathing suit and a diaphanous dressing
gown, in which, clearly, she was to be thrown up from the sea like a
castaway; it also contained Miss Greta and Mister Abe. "Can't you
row any faster, Abe," his sweetheart reproached him. Mister Abe saw
the black heads as they moved towards the shore and said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Ts-ts."</p>

<p>"Ts."</p>

<p>Mister Abe pulled the boat up onto the sand and helped Li and Miss
Greta out of it. "Hurry over to the camera, now," whispered the
artist, "and when I say Now, start filming."</p>

<p>"But we won't be able to see anything," Abe objected.</p>

<p>"Then Judy will just have to put the lights on. Greta!"</p>

<p>While Mister Abe Loeb took up his place at the camera the artist
positioned herself on the sand like a dying swan and Miss Greta
adjusted the folds of her dressing gown. "Make sure they can see
something of my legs," the artist whispered. "Is that it now? Okay,
so move back! Abe, Now!"</p>

<p>Abe began turning the handle. "Judy, lights!" But no lights came
on. Swaying shadows were emerging from the sea and coming closer to
Li. Greta pushed her hand into her mouth so that she would not
scream. "Li," called Mister Abe, "Li, run!"</p>

<p>"Knife!"</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts."</p>

<p>"Li."</p>

<p>"Li."</p>

<p>"A-abe!"</p>

<p>Somebody removed the safety catch on his revolver. "Don't shoot,
damn it!" hissed the captain.</p>

<p>"Li," called Abe and stopped filming. "Judy, lights!"</p>

<p>Li slowly and languidly stood up and raised her hands to the sky.
The flimsy dressing gown slid down off her shoulders, and there was
Lily in all her whiteness, stretching her lovely arms above her head
as castaways do when they recover from having fainted. Mister Abe
began angrily to turn the handle. "For Gods sake, Judy, put the
lights on!"</p>

<p>"Ts-ts-ts!"</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"Knife."</p>

<p>"A-be!"</p>

<p>The swaying black shadows formed a ring around Li in all her
whiteness. But wait, this was no longer a game. Li no longer had
her arms stretched up above her head, she was pushing something away
from herself and screaming, "Abe, Abe, one of them touched me!" Just
then a blinding glare of lights came on, Abe was quickly turning the
handle, Fred and the captain ran towards Li with their revolvers, and
Li was crouching on the sand shrieking with horror. At the same
time, the fierce light showed tens or hundreds of long dark shadows
slipping into the sea as if fleeing from it. At the same time two
divers threw a net over one of the shadows as it fled. At the same
time Greta fainted and fell to the ground like an empty sack. At the
same time two or three shots rang out and caused large splashes in
the sea, the two divers with the net were lying on something which
twisted and coiled under them, and the light in the hands of Miss
Judy went out.</p>

<p>The captain switched on his pocket torch. "Children, is everyone
alright?"</p>

<p>"One of them touched my leg," wailed sweetheart Li. "Oh Fred, it
was awful!" then Mister Abe ran up with his torch.</p>

<p>"Hey, that was great, Li," he declared enthusiastically, "but I
wish Judy had put the lights on earlier"</p>

<p>"The wouldn't go on," exclaimed Judy. "They wouldn't go on, would
they Fred."</p>

<p>"Judy was afraid," Fred apologised for her. "But she didn't do it
on purpose, I swear, did you Judy." Judy felt insulted, but in the
meantime the two divers had arrived, dragging behind them something
in the net that was thrashing about like an enormous fish.</p>

<p>"So here it is, Captain. And it's alive."</p>

<p>"The damned brute squirted some kind of poison at us. My hands
are covered in blisters. And it hurts like Hell."</p>

<p>"And it touched me as well," whined Miss Li. "Abe, put the lights
on! I want to see if I've got any blisters."</p>

<p>"No, sweetheart, there's nothing there," Abe assured here; he was
going to kiss the spot just above her knee, but his sweetheart was
anxiously rubbing at it.</p>

<p>"It was so cold, brr," sweetheart Li complained.</p>

<p>"You dropped one of your pearls, ma'am," said one of the divers as
he handed over the little ball he had picked up from the sand.</p>

<p>"Gee, look Abe," Miss Li squealed, "they brought more pearls for
me! All of you come and look for the pearls! There must be lots of
pearls round here that the poor animals brought for me! Aren't they
sweet, Fred? Here's another one!"</p>

<p>"Here's one too!" The three pocket torches were pointed down to
the ground.</p>

<p>"I've found one that's enormous!"</p>

<p>"That belongs to me!" shouted sweetheart Li.</p>

<p>"Fred," came the icy voice of Miss Judy.</p>

<p>"Be right with you," said Fred as he crawled about the sand on his
knees.</p>

<p>"Fred, I want to go back to the ship!"</p>

<p>"Somebody'll take you there," Fred told her as he continued
searching. "Hey, this is fun!" Li and the three men continued
crawling about in the sand.</p>

<p>"I've got three pearls here," the captain declared.</p>

<p>"Show me, show me," squealed Li excitedly and, still on her knees,
ran over to him. Just then, there was a sudden glare of magnesium
light and the sound of the handle on the camera being turned.</p>

<p>"Now I've got you," declared Judy vengefully. "This is going to
be a great shot for the papers. Americans look for pearls. Marine
reptiles throw pearls to people." Fred sat down.</p>

<p>"Christ, Judy's right guys; we've got to tell the press about
this!" Li sat down.</p>

<p>"Judy is so nice. Judy, take us again, only this time from the
front!"</p>

<p>"That wouldn't do you any favors, honey," opined Judy.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Mister Abe, "we really ought to keep on searching.
The tides coming in."</p>

<p>In the darkness, at the edge of the sea, a black and swaying
shadow appeared. Li screamed: "There...there..." The three
torches were turned in that direction. It was only Greta on her
knees, looking for pearls in the dark.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>On Li's lap was the captain's cap with twenty-one pearls in it.
Abe poured the drinks and Judy played the gramophone. It was an
idyllic, starry night with the eternal sound of the sea.</p>

<p>""So what are we going to call it?" Fred insisted. "
<em>Milwaukee industrialists daughter films prehistoric
reptiles</em>. "</p>

<p>" <em>Primordial lizards praise youth and beauty</em>, "
suggested Abe poetically.</p>

<p>" <em>SS Gloria Pickford discovers unknown species</em>, " the
captain advised. Or " <em>The mystery of Tahuara Island</em>. "</p>

<p>"Those are just sub-titles," said Fred. "A title really to say
more than that."</p>

<p>"How about: <em>Baseball Fred in struggle with monsters</em>, "
Judy suggested. "Fred was fantastic when they came at him. I hope
that came out all right on film!"</p>

<p>The captain cleared his throat. "Actually Miss Judy, I was the
first on the scene, but we neednt talk about that. I think the title
ought to have a scientific sound to it, sir. Something formal and
...well, scientific. <em>Anteliduvian fauna on Pacific
island</em>."</p>

<p>" Anteviludian," Fred corrected him. "No, wait, Anteduvidian.
Hell, hows it supposed to go? Anteduvidual. Antedinivian. No,
thats not it. We;re going to have to think up some simpler title,
something that anyone can say. Judys good at that sort of
thing."</p>

<p>" Antediluvian," said Judy.</p>

<p>Fred twisted round to look at her. "Thats too long, Judy. It's
longer than those monsters with the tails. A title needs to be
shorter. But isn't Judy great? Captain, dont you think shes
great?"</p>

<p>"She is," the captain agreed. "A remarkable girl."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Captain," acknowledged the young giant. "The
captain is a great guy. Only, Anteviludian fauna is kinda dumb.
Thats no kind of title for the papers. How about <em>Lovers on the
Island of Pearls</em>, or something like that?"</p>

<p>" <em>Tritons shower the radiant Lily with pearls</em>, " shouted
Abe. " <em>Worship from the Empire of Poseidon</em>! <em>The new
Aphrodite!</em> "</p>

<p>"Thats stupid," protested Fred. "There never were any tritons.
Thats been scientifically proven. And there was never any Aphrodite
either, were there Judy. <em>Humans meet with ancient lizards! The
noble captain attacks antediluvian monsters!</em> <em>  </em> It
needs to have some pazazz, this title!"</p>

<p>"Special edition," declared Abe. " <em>Film star attacked by sea
monsters! Modern womans sex appeal triumphs over primitive lizards!
Primordial reptiles prefer blondes!</em> "</p>

<p>"Abe," sweetheart Li interrupted. "I have an idea."</p>

<p>"What sort of idea?"</p>

<p>"An idea for a film. Itll be just fantastic, Abe. Just imagine,
I'd be bathing in the sea...</p>

<p>"That blouse really suits you, Li," Abe interjected.</p>

<p>"What? And these tritons would fall in love with me and take me
away to the bottom of the sea. And I would be their queen."</p>

<p>"At the bottom of the sea?"</p>

<p>"That's right, under the water. In their secret kingdom, see,
where they have cities and everything."</p>

<p>"But sweetheart, at the bottom of the sea you'd drown!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, I can swim," said his sweetheart
innocently. "So once every day I'd swim up to the shore and breath
some air." Li demonstrated her breathing exercises, which involved
raising her chest and moving her arms as if swimming. "Like that,
see? And on the shore someone, like a young fisherman maybe, would
fall in love with me and I'd fall in love with him. Wouldn't that be
great?" said sweetheart Li with a sigh. "And he would be so handsome
and strong, and these tritons would want to drown him, but I would
save him and go with him back to where he lives and the tritons would
discover us there and then...and then maybe you could all come
along and save us."</p>

<p>"Li," said Fred seriously, "that is so dumb that I swear they even
<em>could</em> make a film of it. I'll be surprised if old Jesse
doesn't make a great film out of it."</p>

<p>Fred was right; Jesse Loeb Pictures did, later on, produce a great
film with Miss Lily Valley in the leading role; it also had six
hundred nayads, one Neptune and twelve thousand extras dressed as
various kinds of underwater lizard. But before the film was
completed a lot of water had flowed away and many incidents took
place, such as:</p>

<p>1. The animal they had captured and kept in Miss Lily's bathtub
attracted the lively attention of everyone for two days; by the third
day it had stopped moving and Miss Li insisted it was just shy, poor
thing; by the third day it had begun to stink and had to be thrown
away in an advanced state of decay.</p>

<p>2. Only two pieces of film shot at the lagoon were any use. On
one of them sweetheart Li was crouching in terror, waving her arms
desperately at one of the animals standing nearby. Everyone agreed
it was a great shot. The second showed three men and one girl
kneeling down with their noses close to the ground; all of them were
seen from the rear and it looked as if they were bowing down to
something.  This piece of film was suppressed.</p>

<p>3. Almost all the titles suggested for the newspapers were used
(even the ones about the antediluvian fauna) in hundreds and hundreds
of journals, weeklies and magazines in America and all round the
world. They were accompanied with full and detailed accounts of what
had happened and many photographs, such as the one of sweetheart Li
among the lizards, the one of a single lizard in the bathtub, the one
of Li by herself in her bathing suit, photographs of Miss Judy,
Mister Abe Loeb, Baseball Fred, the captain of the yacht, the yacht
itself, the island of Taraiva and a large number of pearls displayed
on black velvet. In this way the career of sweetheart Li was
assured; she even refused to appear in music hall and declared to
journalists that she would devote herself to her Art.</p>

<p>4. There were of course those claiming specialist knowledge who
asserted, as far as could be judged from the photographs, that these
were not primaeval lizards at all but some kind of newt. Those with
even more specialist knowledge asserted that this species of newt was
not known to science and therefore did not exist. There was a long
debate in the press about this which came to an end when professor J.
W. Hopkins (Yale University) announced that he had examined the
photographs available and considered them to be a hoax or a montage;
that the species shown seemed to resemble the great covered-gill newt
(Cryptobranchus japo&Acirc;&shy;nicus, Sieboldia maxima, Tritomegas
Sieboldii or Megalo&Acirc;&shy;batrachus Sieboldii), but done in a
way that was inaccurate, inartistic and downright dilletante. In
this way the matter remained scientifically settled for a long
period.</p>

<p>5. After a suitable time had elapsed, Mister Abe Loeb eventually
married Miss Judy. His closest friend, Baseball Fred, was best man
in a wedding performed with great celebration and the participation
of a wide range of outstanding personalities in politics, art and
other fields.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<h4>ANDRIAS SCHEUCHZERI</h4>

<p>The inquisitiveness of man is boundless. It was not enough that
Professor J. W. Hopkins (Yale University), the greatest authority of
the day in the field of herpatology, had declared these mysterious
creatures to be unscientific humbug and mere fantasy; both the
specialist and the general press began to report frequent discoveries
of these previously unknown animals, resembling giant newts, in all
parts of the Pacific Ocean. Relatively reliable reports came from
the Solomon Isles, Schoutoen Island, Kapingamarang, Butarit and
Tapeteuea, and then further reports came from entire archipelagoes:
Nudufetau, Fanufuti, Nukonono and Fukaofu, and then from Kiau,
Uahuka, Uapu and Pukapuka. Rumours about Captain van Toch's demons
and Miss Lily's tritons circulated around Melanesia and Polynesia
respectively; and the papers judged there must be various kinds of
underwater and prehistoric monsters, especially as the summer had
begun and there was nothing else to write about. The underwater
monsters were especially successful among their readers and tritons
became the height of fashion in the USA that season; a spectacular
revue called Poseidon was performed three hundred times in New York
with three hundred of the most beautiful tritonesses and syrens; on
the beaches of Miami and California young people bathed in costumes
of tritons and nayads (ie. three strings of pearls and nothing else),
while in the states of the midwest the Movement for the Suppression
of Immorality gained enormously in numbers; there were public
demonstrations and several negroes were hanged or burned alive.</p>

<p>Eventually the National Geographic Magazine published a special
edition covering the scientific expeditions of Columbia University
(instigated by J.S. Tincker, otherwise known as the Tin-can King).
The reports were endorsed by P. L. Smith, W. Kleinschmidt, Charles
Kovar, Louis Forgeron and D. Herrero , which covered all the worlds'
authorities in the disciplines of fish parasites, ringworm, botany,
infusoria and aphids. Their extensive coverage included:</p>

<p>...On the island of Rakahanga the expedition first encountered
prints left by the rear legs of a hitherto unknown species of newt.
The prints show five toes, between three and four centimetres long.
The number of prints left shows that the coast around the island must
have been swarming with these newts. There were no prints of front
legs (apart from one set of four, clearly left by a juvenile),
showing clearly that these newt move about on their rear limbs.</p>

<p>...It is worth mentioning that there is neither river nor
marshland on the island of Rakahanga; this indicates that these newts
live in the sea and are most likely the only representatives of that
order living in a pelagic environment. It is well known, of course,
that the Mexican axolotl (Amblystoma mexicanum) lives in salt lakes,
but not even the classic work of W. Korngold, Caudate Amphibians
(Urodela), Berlin, 1913, makes any mention of newts living in the
sea.</p>

<p>...We waited until into the afternoon in order that we might
catch, or at least catch sight of, a live specimen, but in vain.
With some regret, we left the island of Rakahanga, where D. Herrer
had been successful in finding a beautiful new species of lizard
heperoptera. We met with much greater success, however, on the
island of Tongarewa. We waited on the foreshore with our guns in our
hands. Soon after sunset, the head of a newt emerged from the water,
relatively large and slightly flattened. After a short while the
newts climbed out onto the sand, swaying as they walked on their hind
legs but nonetheless quite agile. When sitting they were just over
three feet in height. They sat around in a wide circle and began
making distinctive and vigorous circling movements of the upper parts
of their bodies, giving the impression that they were dancing. W.
Kleinschmidt stood up in order to obtain a better view. At this, the
newts turned to look at him and soon were entirely stiff and
motionless; they then began with remarkable speed to approach him,
uttering sibilant barking sounds. When they were about seven paces
away we opened fire on them. They fled, very quickly, and threw
themselves into the sea; they were not seen again that evening. On
the shore, there remained no more than two dead newts and one newt
with a broken spine, uttering an odd sound, something like ogod,
ogod, ogod. It then expired after W. Kleinschmidt used a knife to
open its pulmonary cavity...</p>

<p>(There followed a series of anatomical details which we laymen
would be unable to understand; readers with specialist knowledge are
referred to the bulletin cited.)</p>

<p>The above indicators make it clear that this was a typical
member of the order of caudate amphibians (urodela) which, as is
widely known, includes the salamander genus (salamandridae),
comprising the family of spotted salamanders (tritons) and newts
(salamandrae), and the family of tadpole spawning newts
(ichthyoidea), made up of the pseudo-gilled newts (cryptobranchiata)
and the gilled newts (phanerobranchiata). The newt found on the
island of Tongarewa seems to be most closely related to the tadpole
spawning pseudo-gilled newts; in many respects, including its size,
it is reminiscent of the great Japanese newt (megalobatrachus
sieboldii) or the American hellbender, better known as the mud devil,
but it does distinguish itself from these species by its well
developed sensors and the greater length and strength of its limbs
which enable it to move with some facility both in water and on
land. (There followed further details of comparative anatomy).</p>

<p><img width="334" height="153" alt="" src="0601981h-images/0601981h-1.jpg" /></p>

<p><em>Andrias Scheuchzeri</em></p>

<p>After we had prepared the skeletons of the animals killed we
made a very interesting observation: the skeleton of these newts is
almost identical with the fossil remains of a newt's skeleton found
by Dr. Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer in the &Atilde;&mdash;hningen Fault
and described by him in his "Homo Diluvii Testis", published in
1726. Readers less familiar with his work are reminded that the
above mentioned Dr. Scheuchzer regarded this fossil as the remains of
a human being from before the Flood. "Members of the educated
World," he writes, "will see from the accompanying Woodcut that there
is no Doubt whatsoever that we are dealing with a Man who was Witness
to the Great Flood; there is no Feature that does not make ample
Display of what could only be a Feature of Mankind, for it does
everywhere conform with all the individual Parts of the Skeleton of
Man in all its Dimensions. It is a Man made of Stone and shown from
the Front; it is a Memorial of Man in a Form now extinct, older than
all the Tombs of the Romans, Greeks or even Egyptians or any other
People of the East." At a later date, Cuvier recognised the
&Atilde;&mdash;hningen fossil skeleton as that of a newt, known as
Cryptobranchus Primaevus or Andrias Scheuchzeri Tschudi and long
since considered extinct. By means of osteological comparisonswe
were able to identify this newt as the primitive and supposedly
extinct newt, Andrias. The mysterious ancient reptile, as the
newspapers described it, is nothing other than the newt with covered
gills known from the fossil record as Andrias Scheuchzeri; or if a
new name is needed Cryptobranchus Tinckeri Erectus or the Polynesian
Great Newt.</p>

<p>...The question as to why this interesting giant newt has
hitherto escaped scientific attention remains a mystery, especially
considering the large numbers in which it is found on the islands of
Rakahanga and Tongarewa in the Manihiki archipelago. Neither
Randolph nor Montgomery make mention of it in their publication Two
Years in the Manihiki Islands (1885). The local inhabitants insist
that this animal--which they also consider to be poisonous--began
to appear no more than six or eight years ago. They say that these
sea demons are capable of speech (!), and that in the bays where they
live they construct entire systems of weirs and sea-walls in a way
that resembles underwater cities; that the water in their bays
remains as still as a mill pond throughout the entire year; that they
excavate dens and passages in the ground under the water which are
many meters long and in which they remain during the day; that at
night they come out into the fields to steal sweet potatoes and yams
and take hoes and pickaxes and other tools from the human
population. The native people have developed a strong aversion to
the newts and even live somewhat in fear of them; many of them have
preferred to move away to other areas. It is clear that this is
nothing more than primitive legends and superstitions resulting from
the revolting appearance and upright stance and gait, somewhat
resembling the walk of a human being, of these harmless giant
newts.</p>

<p>...Travellers tales, according to which these newts are also
to be found on other islands than Manihiki, should be taken with
extreme caution. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the fresh
footprints found on the shore of the island of Tongatabu and
published by Captain Croisset in La Nature are those of Andrias
Scheuchzer. This finding is of especial importance given that they
form a connection between their appearance on the Manihiki Islands
with Australasia, where so many vestiges of the development of
ancient fauna have been preserved; let us bear in mind in particular
the antediluvian lizard hateri or tuatara, which survives to this day
on Stephen Island. These islands are mostly sparsely inhabited and
hardly touched by civilization, and it is possible that isolated
remains of species elsewhere extinct may have continued to survive
there. Thanks to the efforts of Mister J.S. Tincker, an antediluvian
newt has now been added to the ancient lizard, hateri. If the good
Dr. Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer were alive today he would see the
resurrection of his Adam of &Atilde;&mdash;hningen...</p>
</div>

<p>This learned bulletin would certainly have been sufficient to
satisfy scientific curiosity about the mysterious sea monsters that
were being talked about so much. Unfortunately though, the Dutch
researcher, van Hogenhouck, published a report at the same time in
which he classified these covered-gilled giant newts in the order of
proper newts or tritons under the name of megatriton molucccanus and
established that they were distributed throughout the Dutch-Sundanese
islands of Jilolo, Morotai and Ceram; there was also a report by the
French scientist Dr. Mignard who saw them as typical salamanders and
concluded that they had originated in the French islands of Takaroa,
Rangiroa and Raroia, calling them simply cryptobranchus
salamandroides; there was also a report from H.W. Spence in which he
claimed to have recognised a new order of pelagidae, native to the
Gilbert Isles, which could be classified under the species name of
pelagotriton spencei. Mr. Spence succeeded in transporting a live
specimen to London Zoo, where it became the subject of further
research and was given the names pelagobatrachus hookeri,
salamandrops maritimus, abranchus giganteus, amphiuma gigas and many
others. Many scientists insisted that pelagotriton spencei was the
same as cryptobranchus tinckeri or that Mignards salamander was no
other than andrias scheuchzeri; there were many disputes about
priority and other purely scientific questions. So it was that in
the end every nation had its own giant newts and furiously and
scientifically criticised the newts of other nations. That is why
there never was any scientifically agreed opinion about the whole
great matter of the newts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<h4>ANDREW SCHEUCHZER</h4>

<div class="section">
<p>One Thursday afternoon, when London zoo was closed to the public,
Mister Thomas Greggs, who was in charge of the lizard pavillion, was
cleaning out the tanks and terraria. He was entirely alone in the
newt section where the great Japanese newt, the American hellbender,
Andrias Scheuchzeri and a number of small amphibians, axolotls, eels,
reptiles and frogs were exhibited. Mister Greggs went round with his
duster and his broom, singing <em>Annie Laurie</em> as he went; when
suddenly a rasping voice behind him said:</p>

<p>"Look Mum."</p>

<p>Mister Thomas Greggs looked round, but there was nobody there;
there was just the hellbender slopping around in its mud and that big
black newt, that Andrias, which was leant up against the edge of the
tank with its front paws and twisting its body round. Must have
imagined it, thought Mister Greggs, and continued to sweep the floor
till it shone.</p>

<p>"Look, a newt," he heard from behind him. Mister Greggs turned
quickly round; that black newt, that Andrias, was watching him,
blinking with its lower eyelids.</p>

<p>"Ugh, it's ugly, isn't it," the newt said suddenly. "Dont get too
close to it, love." Mister Greggs opened his mouth in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You sure it doesnt bite?" the newt rasped.</p>

<p>"You ...you can speak!" Mister Greggs stammered, unable to
believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Im scared of that one," the newt exclaimed. "What does it eat,
Mum?"</p>

<p>"Say Good afternoon," said the astonished Mister Greggs. The newt
twisted its body round. "Good afternoon," it rasped. "Good
afternoon. Good afternoon. Can I give it a cake?" In some
confusion, Mister Greggs reached into his pocket and drew out a piece
of bread.</p>

<p>"Here you are, then"</p>

<p>The newt took the lump of bread into its paw and tried a piece of
it. "Look, a newt," it muttered contentedly. "Dad, why is it so
black?" Suddenly the newt dived back into the water and just its
head re-emerged. "Whys it in the water? Why? Ooh, it's not very
nice!"</p>

<p>Mister Thomas Greggs scratched the back of his neck in surprise.
Oh, it's just repeating what it's heard people saying. "Say Greggs,"
he tried.</p>

<p>"Say Greggs," the newt repeated.</p>

<p>"Mister Thomas Greggs."</p>

<p>"Mister Thomas Greggs."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon." The newt
seemed able to continue talking without getting tired of it; but by
now Greggs did not know what he could say; Mister Thomas Greggs was
not a talkative man.</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth for now," he said, "and then when Im ready I'll
teach you how to talk."</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth for now," gurgled the newt. "Good afternoon.
Look, a newt. I'll teach you how to talk."</p>

<p>The management of the zoo, however, did not look kindly on it when
its zookeepers taught the animals tricks; with the elephant it was
different, but the other animals were there for educational purposes
and not to be presented like in a circus. Mister Greggs therefore
kept a secret of the time he spent in the newt pavilion, and was
there after all the other people had left, and as he was a widower
nobody was curious about his being there by himself. Everyone has
his own taste. And not many people went to the newt pavilion anyway;
the crocodiles were popular with everyone but Andrias Scheuchzeri
spent his days in relative solitude.</p>

<p>One day, when it was getting dark and the pavilions were closing,
the director of the zoo, Sir Charles Wiggam, was wandering round the
different sections just to see that everything was in order. As he
went past the newt pavilion there was a splash in one of the tanks
and a rasping voice said, "Good evening".</p>

<p>"Good evening," the director answered, somewhat surprised. "Whos
there?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," the rasping voice said, "I thought it was
Mister Greggs."</p>

<p>"Whos there?" the director repeated.</p>

<p>"Andy. Andrew Scheuchzer."  Sir Charles went closer to the
tank. All he saw was one newt sitting upright and immobile.</p>

<p>"Who said that?"</p>

<p>"Andy," said the newt. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Wiggam," exclaimed Sir Charles in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you," said Andrias politely. "How do you
do?"</p>

<p>"Damn it all!" Sir Charles roared. "Greggs! Hey, Greggs!" The
newt flipped quickly away and hid in the water. Mister Thomas Greggs
hurried in through the door, out of breath and somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>"How can I help you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Greggs, what's the meaning of this?" Sir Charles began.</p>

<p>"Has something happened, sir?" stammered Mister Greggs, rather
unsure of himself.</p>

<p>"This animal is speaking!"</p>

<p>"I do beg your pardon, sir," replied Mister Greggs contritely.
"You're not to do that, Andy. I've told you a thousand times you're
not to bother the people with all your talk. I am sorry, sir, it
won't happen again."</p>

<p>"Is it you that's taught this newt to speak?"</p>

<p>"Well it was him what started it, sir," Greggs defended
himself.</p>

<p>"I hope it won't happen again, Greggs," said Sir Charles
severely. "I'll be keeping an eye on you."</p>

<p>Some time after this incident, Sir Charles was sitting with
Professor Petrov and talking about so-called animal intelligence,
conditioned responses, and about how the popular view will over
estimate how much an animal is capable of understanding. Professor
Petrov expressed his doubts about Elberfeld's horses who, it was
said, could not only count but also work out squares and square
roots; after all, not even a normal educated man can work out square
roots, said the great scientist. Sir Charles thought of Greggs
talking newt. "I have a newt here," he began hesitantly, "that
famous andrias scheuchzer it is, and it has learned to talk like a
parrot."</p>

<p>"Out of the question," said the scientist. "Newts don't have the
right sort of tongue."</p>

<p>"Then come and have a look," said Sir Charles. "It's cleaning day
today, so there won't be too many people there." And out they
went.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the newt pavillion sir Charles stopped. From
inside could be heard the scraping of a broom and a monotonous voice
saying something very slowly.</p>

<p>"Wait," Sir Charles whispered.</p>

<p>"Is there life of Mars?" the monotonous voice said. "Shall I read
it?"</p>

<p>"No, read us something else, Andy," another voice answered.</p>

<p>"Who's to win this years Derby; Pelham Beauty or Gobernador?"</p>

<p>"Pelham Beauty," the second voice replied. "But read it
anyway."</p>

<p>Sir Charles opened the door very quietly. Mister Thomas Greggs
was sweeping the floor; and in the tank of sea water sat Andrias
Scheuchzeri, slowly, word by word in a rasping voice, reading out the
evening paper which he held in his front paws. "Greggs," shouted Sir
Charles. The newt flipped over backwards and disappeared under the
water. Mister Greggs was startled and dropped his broom.</p>

<p>"Yes sir?"</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"Please forgive me, sir," stuttered the unfortunate Greggs. "Andy
always reads to me when I'm doing the sweeping. And then when he's
sweeping it's me what reads to him."</p>

<p>"And who taught him to do that?"</p>

<p>"He worked it out for himself, sir. I...I just gave him my
paper so that he wouldn't keep talking all the time. He was always
talking, sir. So I just thought he could at least learn how to talk
proper..."</p>

<p>"Andy," called Sir Charles. A black head emerged from the
water.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," it rasped.</p>

<p>"Professor Petrov has come to look at you."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you Professor. I'm Andy Scheuchzer."</p>

<p>"How do you know your name is Andrias Scheuchzeri?"</p>

<p>"Well it's written down here, sir. Andreas Scheuchzer. Gilbert
Islands."</p>

<p>"And do you often read the newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes sir. Every day."</p>

<p>"And what parts do you most like to read?"</p>

<p>"Court cases, horse racing, football,..."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a football match?"</p>

<p>"No sir."</p>

<p>"Or a horse race?"</p>

<p>"No sir."</p>

<p>"Then why do you read it?"</p>

<p>"Cause it's in the paper, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you have no interest in politics?"</p>

<p>"No sir. Is there going to be a war?"</p>

<p>"Nobody can tell you that, Andy."</p>

<p>"Germanys building a new type of submarine," said Andy anxiously.
"Death rays can turn a whole continent to dust."</p>

<p>"That's what you've read in the paper, is it?" asked Sir
Charles.</p>

<p>"Yes sir. Who's going to win this years Derby; Pelham Beauty or
Gobernador?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, Andy?"</p>

<p>"I think Gobernador, sir; but Mister Greggs thinks Pelham
Beauty." Andy nodded his head. "Always buy English products.
Snider's braces are the best. Do you have the new six-cylinder
Tancred Junior yet? Fast, economic and elegant."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Andy. That will be enough now."</p>

<p>"Who's your favourite film star?" The hair of Professor Petrov's
head and moustache bristled.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Sir Charles," he complained, "I really have to go
now."</p>

<p>"Very well, lets go. Andy, would you mind if some very learned
gentlemen came to see you? I think they would be very glad to talk
to you."</p>

<p>"I shall look forward to it, sir," the newt rasped. "Goodbye Sir
Charles. Goodbye Professor."</p>

<p>The professor ran from the pavillion snorting and gasping in
amazement. "Forgive me, Sir Charles," he said at last, "but could
you not show me an animal that does not read the newspapers?"</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<p>The three learned gentlemen turned out to be Sir Bertram, D.M.,
Professor Ebbigham, Sir Oliver Dodge, Julian Foxley and others. The
following is part of the record of the experiment with Andrias
Scheuchzeri.</p>

<p><em>What is your name?</em></p>

<p>Answer: <em>Andrezu Scheuchzer</em></p>

<p><em>How old are you?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>I don't know. If you want to look younger, wear the
Libella corset.</em></p>

<p><em>What is the date today?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Monday. It's nice weather today. Gibraltar is running in
the Epsom this Saturday.</em></p>

<p><em>What is three times five?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Why?</em></p>

<p><em>Are you able to count?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Oh yes. What is seventeen times twenty-nine?</em></p>

<p><em>Leave us to ask the questions, Andrew. Name some English
rivers for us.</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>The Thames...</em></p>

<p><em>What else?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Thames.</em></p>

<p><em>You don't know any others, do you. Who governs
England?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>King George. God bless him.</em></p>

<p><em>Very good Andy. Who is the greatest English writer?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Kipling.</em></p>

<p><em>Splendid. Have you read anything by him?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>No. How do you like Mae West?</em></p>

<p><em>It's better if we ask the questions, Andy. What do you know
of English history?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Henry VIII.</em></p>

<p><em>And what do you know about him?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>The best film in recent years. Fantastic costumes. A
great show.</em></p>

<p><em>Have you seen it?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>I haven't. Get to know England: Buy yourself a Ford
Baby.</em></p>

<p><em>What would you most like to see, Andy?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.</em></p>

<p><em>How many continents are there?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Five.</em></p>

<p><em>Very good. And what are they called.</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>England, and the other ones.</em></p>

<p><em>What are the other ones called?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>There are the Bolsheviks and the Germans. And
Italy.</em></p>

<p><em>Where are the Gilbert Islands?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>In England. England will not lay a hand on the
continent. England needs ten thousand aeroplanes. Visit the English
south coast.</em></p>

<p><em>May we have a look at your tongue, Andy?</em></p>

<p>A.: <em>Yes sir. Clean your teeth with Flit toothpaste: it's
economic, it's the best and it's English. For sweet smelling breath,
use Flit toothpaste.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you, Andy, that will be enough. And now, Andy, tell us
...</em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>

<p>And so on. The transcript of the conversation with Andrias
Scheuchzeri covered sixteen pages and was published in <em>Natural
Science</em>. At the end of the transcript the committee of
specialists summarised its findings thus:</p>

<p><em>1. Andrias Scheuchzeri, a newt kept in London Zoo, is capable
of speech, albeit it in a somewhat rasping voice; it has around four
hundred words at its disposal; it says only what it has already heard
or read. There is, of course, no question of any independent
thought. Its tongue is quite mobile; under the circumstances we were
unable to examine the vocal cords any closer.</em></p>

<p><em>2. The newt is also able to read, although only the evening
paper. It takes an interest in the same subjects as the average
Englishman and reacts to them in a similar way, ie. with fixed and
generally accepted views. Its spiritual life--if it is possible to
speak of such a thing--remains in conformity with the conceptions
and opinions of our times. </em></p>

<p><em>3. Its intelligence should not be over-estimated, as it in no
way surpasses that of the average modern man.</em></p>

<p>Despite this sober assessment by the committee of specialists, the
Talking Newt became the sensation of London Zoo. Andy was the
darling of the crowds that surrounded him and wanted to talk to him
on every possible subject, starting with the weather and finishing
with the economic crisis and the political situation. At the same
time he was given so much chocolate and sweets by his visitors that
he became seriously ill in his gastro-intestinal tract. In the end
the newt section had to be closed down, but it was already too late;
Andrias Scheuchzeri, known as Andy, died as a result of his
popularity, showing that even newts can be corrupted by fame.</p>

<h4>TOWN CARNIVAL IN NOV&Atilde;&permil; STRA&Aring; AC&Atilde;</h4>

<p>Mister Povondra, the butler in the Bondy household, was spending
this holiday in his native town. There was to be a carnival the
following day; and when Mister Povondra went out he led his eight
year old son, Frank, by the hand. The whole of Nov&Atilde;&copy;
Stra&Aring;&iexcl;ac&Atilde;&shy; was filled with the scent of cakes
and pastries and across the street were women and girls coming and
going to the bakers with cakes. Two tents had already been set up on
the square selling sweets and cakes and coffee, and a hardware dealer
was there with his glass and porcelain, and a woman was shouting that
she had embroidery and knitwear of every sort you could think of.
And then there was a hut made of canvas covered in cloth on all
sides. A lightly built man stood there on a ladder fixing on a sign
at the top of it.</p>

<p>Mister Povondra stopped so that he could see what it said.</p>

<p>The thin man climbed down from his ladder and looked up
contentedly at the sign he had just put up. And Mister Povondra,
with some surprise, read:</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>CAPTAIN J. VAN TOCH</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>and his performing newts</p>

<p>Mister Povondra thought of the big fat man with the captain's cap
who he had once shown in to see Mister Bondy. And now look where he
is, the poor man, thought Mister Povondra in sympathy; a captain he
was, and now he's travelling about with some pitiful circus act!
Such an impressive and healthy man he was! Maybe I should go in and
see how he is, thought the compassionate Mister Povondra.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the thin man had hung up a second sign at the entrance
to the tent:</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>!! TALKING LIZARDS !!</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>!! THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC SENSATION
!!</p>

<p style='text-align: center'>Entrance 2 koruny. Children
(accompanied by parents) half price!</p>

<p>Mister Povondra hesitated. Two koruny and another koruna for the
lad, that was not cheap. But Frank liked to learn things, and it
would all be part of his education to learn about animals in other
parts of the world. Mister Povondra was willing to sacrifice
something for the boy's education, and so he walked up to the thin
man. "Hello," he said, "I'd like to talk to Captain van Toch if
that's alright." The little man's chest expanded in his stripey
teeshirt.</p>

<p>"I'm Captain van Toch, sir."</p>

<p>"You're Captain van Toch?" answered Mister Povondra in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes sir," said the little man, and showed him the anchor tattooed
on his wrist." Mister Povondra blinked in surprise. How could the
captain have shrunk down so small? Surely that's not possible.</p>

<p>"I am personally acquainted with Captain van Toch," he said. "My
name is Povondra."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's different, then," said the little man. "But these
newts really are Captain van Toch's. Guaranteed genuine Australian
lizards. Come and have a look inside. Were just starting the main
show now," he said as he lifted the sheet at the entrance.</p>

<p>"Come along, Frank," said Frank's father, and in they went. An
exceptionally big and fat woman quickly sat down behind a little
table. An odd couple they make, thought Mister Povondra as he paid
his three koruny. Inside the tent there was nothing but a rather
unpleasant smell and a tin bath.</p>

<p>"Where are the newts?" Mister Povondra asked.</p>

<p>"In that bathtub," yawned the enormous woman.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be afraid, Frank," said Mister Povondra, and he
stepped up to the bath. In the water lay something black and
immobile, about the size of a fully grown catfish; except that its
head seemed to be slightly flat and the skin behind it swollen.</p>

<p>"That's the prehistoric newt they've been writing about in all the
papers," said Mister Povondra to his son didactically, not letting
the boy see his disappointment. (Cheated again, he thought, but id
better not let the boy see it. Three koruny down the drain!)</p>

<p>"Dad, why's it sitting in a tub of water?" Frank asked.</p>

<p>"Because that's where newts live, in water."</p>

<p>"And what do newts eat?"</p>

<p>"Fish and that sort of thing," suggested Mister Povondra to his
son. (Well they had to eat something, he supposed.)</p>

<p>"And why's it so ugly?" Frank continued. Mister Povondra didn't
know what to say to that; but at that moment the spindly little man
came into the tent.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen," he began in his cackling
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't you have more than just one newt?" Mister Povondra asked
accusingly. (If there were at least two of them we'd be more like
getting our moneys worth.)</p>

<p>"The other one died," said the man. "This, ladies and gentlemen,
is the famous Andrias, the rare and poisonous lizard from the islands
of Australasia. In its native environment it grows to the size of a
man and walks on two legs. Come on then," he said as he turned to
the black and listless thing in the bathtub, jabbing at it with a
stick. The black thing stirred itself and, with some effort, raised
itself from the water. Frank recoiled a little but Mister Povondra
held his hand tightly, don't be afraid, Daddy's here.</p>

<p>The newt stood on its hind legs and supported itself against the
side of the tub with its front paws. The gills on the back of its
head twitched spasmodically and it breathed with difficulty through
its black snout. Its skin was too loose and covered in warts and
bloody sores, its eyes were round like a frog's and it seemed in pain
when it blinked with some kind of membrane from under the eye.</p>

<p>"As you see, ladies and gentlemen," the man continued in his
cracked voice, "this is an animal that lives in water; which is why
it is equipped with both gills and with lungs to breathe with when it
comes out onto land. It has five toes, but only four fingers, but
can nonetheless hold various items. Here." The animal closed its
fingers around the mans stick and held it in front of itself like a
pitiful sceptre. "It can also tie knots in a piece of rope," the man
declared as he took the stick away and gave the newt a piece of dirty
rope. It held the rope in its hands for a moment and then did indeed
tie a knot. "It can also play on a drum and dance," the man cackled
as he gave the animal a children's drum and drumstick. The animal
struck the drum a few times and twisted the upper half of its body
round; then it dropped the stick into the water. "What d'ye do that
for, vermin?" the man snarled as he fished the stick out. "And this
animal," he declared, raising his voice back to its showman's level
and clapping his hands, "is so intelligent and gifted that it is able
to speak like a human being."</p>

<p>"Guten Morgen," the animal rasped, painfully blinking with its
lower eyelids. "Good morning." Mister Povondra was startled, but it
seemed to make no great impression on Frank.</p>

<p>"What do you say to our honoured public?" the man asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"Welcome to our show," said the newt with a bow as his gills
twitched round. "Willkommen. Ben venuti."</p>

<p>"Can you do arithmetic?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"How much is six times seven?"</p>

<p>"Forty-two," croaked the newt with some effort.</p>

<p>"There, you see Frank?" Franks father pointed out. "It can do
arithmetic."</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the skinny man crowed, "you are invited to
ask questions of your own."</p>

<p>"Ask him something, Frank," Mister Povondra suggested. Frank
squirmed.</p>

<p>"How much is eight times nine?" he finally shouted out; it clearly
seemed to him to be one of the hardest questions possible. The newt
thought for a while.</p>

<p>"Seventy-two."</p>

<p>"What's the day today?" Mister Povondra asked.</p>

<p>"Saturday," said the newt. Mister Povondra was very
impressed.</p>

<p>"Just like a human being. What's the name of this town?" The
newt opened its mouth and blinked.</p>

<p>"It's getting a bit tired now," the man interjected. "Now what do
you say to the ladies and gentlemen?" The newt bowed.</p>

<p>"I am honoured. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Au revoir." And
it quickly hid back in the water.</p>

<p>"That...that's a very remarkable animal," said Mister Povondra
in wonderment; but three koruny was quite a high price to pay, so he
added, "What else do you have to show the boy?" The skinny man was
perplexed and pulled on his lower lip.</p>

<p>"That's all," he said. "I used to have some monkeys and all," he
explained uncertainly, "but they were too much trouble. I could show
you me wife if you like. The fattest woman in the world, she used to
be. Maru&Aring;&iexcl;ka, come over here!" Maru&Aring;&iexcl;ka
heaved herself onto her feet.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Let the gentlemen have a look at you." The fattest woman in the
world put her head coquettishly to one side, raised one leg in front
of her and lifted her skirt above the knee. This revealed her red
knitted stocking which contained something pale and massive, like a
leg of ham. "The upper part of the leg has a circumference of
eighty-four centimetres," the desiccated little man explained, "only
there's so much competition these days that Maru&Aring;&iexcl;ka
isn't the fattest woman in the world any more." Mister Povondra
pulled his astonished Frank away.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," a voice rasped from the bathtub. "Do come
again. Auf wiedersehen."</p>

<p>"What did you think of that, then, Frank?" Mister Povondra asked,
once they were outside. "Did you learn something?"</p>

<p>"Yes Dad," said Frank. "Dad, why was that lady wearing red
stockings?"</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<h4>THE ANTHROPOSAURUSES</h4>

<p>It would certainly be an overstatement to say that nobody at that
time ever spoke or wrote about anything but the talking newts.
People also talked and wrote about other things such as the next war,
the economic crisis, football, vitamins and fashion; but there was a
lot written about the newts, and much of it was very ill-informed.
This is why the outstanding scientist, Professor Vladimir Uher
(University of Brno), wrote an article for the newspaper in which he
pointed out that the putative ability of Andrias Scheuchzer to speak,
which was really no more than the ability to repeat spoken words like
a parrot, was of far less interest from a scientific point of view
than some of the other questions surrounding this remarkable
amphibian. For the scientist, the mysteries of Andrias Scheuchzeri
were quite different: where, for instance, did it come from; where
had it been throughout entire geological periods; how did it remain
unknown for so long when reports of it now were coming in from all
tropical parts of the Pacific Ocean. It seems to have been
multiplying at an exceptional speed in recent times; how had it
acquired such amazing vitality while still in a primitive triassic
form, and how had it remained entirely hidden until recently,
existing, most likely, in extremely isolated geographic pockets? Had
there been a change of some sort in this ancient newt that brought
biological advantages so that this rare vestige from the miocene
period was given a new and remarkably effective period of existence?
In this case it would not be out of the question for Andrias not only
to multiply but even to evolve into a better form, and that human
science would have the unique opportunity to assist in some of the
enormous changes to be undergone by at least one animal species. The
ability of Andrias Scheuchzeri to grunt a few dozen words and learn a
few phrases--which the lay public perceives as a sign of some kind
of intelligence--is no great wonder from a scientific point of view;
but the power and vigour with which it shows its ability to survive,
bringing it so suddenly and so successfully back to life after
spending so long in abeyance, in a retarded state of development and
nearly extinct, is no less than miraculous. There are some unusual
circumstances to be considered here: Andrias Scheuchzeri is the only
species of newt living in the sea and--even more remarkable--the
only newt to be found in the area from Ethiopia to Australasia, the
Lemuria of ancient myths. Could we not almost say that Nature now
wishes to add another form of animal to the world by a precipitate
acceleration of the development of a single species, a species which
she has so far neglected or has so far been unable to bring fully to
life? Moreover: it would be odd if the giant newts of Japan and
those of the Alleghan Islands did not have some connecting link in
the regions of the ocean lying between them. If Andrias had not been
found it would have been necessary to postulate its existence in the
very places where it was found; it would simply be needed to fill the
space where, according to the geographic and developmental context,
it must have been since ancient times. Be that as it may, the
learned professor's article concluded, this evolutionary resurrection
of a miocene newt cannot fail to fill us all with as much reverence
as astonishment at the Genius of Evolution on our planet which is
clearly still far from ending its creative task.</p>

<p>This article was published despite the tacit, but definite, view
of the editors that a learned article of this sort does not belong in
a newspaper. Soon afterwards, Professor Uher received a letter from
one of its readers:</p>

<p><em>Esteemed Professor Uher,</em></p>

<p><em>Last year I bought a house on the town square in
&Auml;&OElig;&Atilde;&iexcl;slav. While examining the house I found
a box in the attic containing some rare and very old papers which
were clearly of a scientific nature. They included two years' issues
of H&Atilde;&frac12;bel's journal,</em> Hyllos <em>for the years 1821
and 22, Jan Svatopluk Presl's</em> Mammals<em>, Vojt&Auml;&rsaquo;ch
Sedl&Atilde;&iexcl;&Auml;ek Z&Atilde;&iexcl;klad's</em> Nature of

publication,</em> Progress<em>, and thirteen years' issues of
the</em> Czech Museum Magazine. <em>Inserted next to Presls
translation of Cuviers</em> Discussion of Upheavals in the Earths
Crust <em>(from 1834) I found and article torn out of some old
newspaper about some remarkable lizards.</em></p>

<p><em>When I read your distinguished article about these mysterious
newts I was reminded of this box and brought it back down. I think
it might be of some interest to you, and I am therefore, as an
enthusiastic nature lover and great admirer of your works, sending
its contents to you.</em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>

<p><em>With deepest respects,</em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>

<p><em>J. V. Najman</em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>

<p>The cutting included with this letter bore neither title nor date;
but the style and spelling suggest it came from the third or fourth
decade of the nineteenth century; it was accordingly so yellow and
decayed that it was very hard to read. Professor Uher was about to
throw it into the bin but he was somehow impressed by the age of this
piece of printed paper; he began to read; and after a short time he
exclaimed "My God!" and readjusted his glasses. The cutting bore the
following text:</p>

<p>Concerning Anthropoid Lizards</p>

<p>We read in one of the newspapers published overseas that a certain
captain, the commander of an English man of war, having returned from
a voyage to distant lands, has brought back reports concerning some
rather remarkable lizards which he encountered on a minor island in
the Australian ocean. On this island, we are told, there is to be
found a salt water lake which has neither access to the open sea nor
any other means of approach not involving great exertions and
difficulties. It was this salt lake that the aforementioned captain
and his medical officer had chosen for their recreation when from it
emerged some unfamiliar animals. These animals greatly resembled
lizards, their means of locomotion, however, was on two legs similar
to human beings. In size they were comparable with a sea lion or
seal, and once on shore they began to move around in their peculiar
manner, giving the impression of a charming and elegant dance. The
captain and his medical officer were successful in obtaining one of
these animals by means of their guns and inform us that their bodies
are of a slimey character, without hair and without anything
resembling scales, so that they bear some resemblance to
salamanders. The following day, when they returned to the same spot,
they were obliged immediately to depart again because of the
overpowering stench, and they instructed their divers to hunt all the
newts in the lake with their nets, by which means all but a few of
the animals were annihilated, leaving no more than two examples which
were taken on board the ship. Upon establishing that their bodies
contained some kind of poison and the skin was burning to the touch
in a way that resembled the sting of a nettle, the animals were
placed in barrels of salt water in order that they might be returned
to england alive. However, while the ship was near the island of
sumatra the captive lizards were successful in making their way from
the barrels, opening without any assistance one of the windows of a
lower deck, throwing themselves into the sea, and making their escape
under cover of darkness. According to the testimony of officers and
ratings on board the ship these animals were remarkably odd and sly,
walking as they did on their hind legs, and issuing strange barking
and squelching sounds. They seemed however to present no danger to
man. It would seem appropriate from the preceding to give them the
name 'anthroposaurus'.</p>

<p>So the cutting went. "My God!" repeated the professor in some
excitement, "why is there no date or title on this cutting? And what
was this foreign newspaper named by this certain commander and what
English ship was this? What was the small island in the Australian
Ocean? couldn't these people have been a bit more precise and a bit
more, well, a bit more scientific? This is a historic document, it's
priceless..."</p>

<p>A small island in the Australian Ocean, yes. A small salt water
lake. It sounds like a coral island, an atoll with a salt lagoon,
difficult of access: just the sort of place a prehistoric species of
this sort might survive, isolated from the evolutional developments
of other species and undisturbed in a natural reservation. Of course
they wouldn't have been able to multiply because of the lack of food
in the lake. It's obvious, the professor said to himself. An animal
similar to a lizard, but without scales and walking on its hind legs
like a man: it could only be Andrias Scheuchzeri, or another newt
closely related to it. Supposing it was the same Andrias. Supposing
those damned divers in that lagoon wiped them out and just the one
pair were taken alive onto that ship; a pair that escaped into the
sea by Sumatra. That would mean right on the Equator, in conditions
highly favourable for life and with unlimited food. Could it be that
this change of environment gave this miocene newt a powerful new
evolutionary impulse? It was certainly used to salt water: lets
suppose its new home was a calm, enclosed bay with plenty of food;
what would happen then? The newts transposed into an environment
with optimal conditions, having enormous vigour; their population
would burgeon. That's it, the scientist declared joyfully. The newts
would start to develop uncontrollably; they would throw themselves
into life like mad; they would multiply at an amazing rate because
their eggs and their tadpoles would have no particular enemies in the
new environment. They would colonise one island after another--it's
only strange that some islands have been overlooked. In all other
respects it's typical of migration patterns in pursuit of food--and
that raises the question of why they didn't develop earlier. Could
it be to do with the fact that there is no known species of newt in
the area between Ethiopia and Australia? Or rather hasn't been until
now. Could there have been some development in this area in the
miocene period which was unfavourable for newts? It is certainly
possible. Could there have been some particular predator which
simply hunted the newts to extinction? Just on a single small
island, with an isolated lake, is where the miocene newt survived--
albeit at the price of its evolution coming to a halt. It was like a
compressed spring waiting to be released. It's not even out of the
question that Nature had its own great plans for this newt, it might
have developed even further and further, higher and higher, who knows
how high...(At this thought, Professor Uher shuddered slightly;
who knows that Andrias Scheuchzeri was not meant to be the human
beings of the miocene!)</p>

<p>Enough of that! This undeveloped animal suddenly finds itself in
a new environment offering boundless promise; a compressed spring
waiting to be released. Andrias will have thrown itself into its
development with so much miocene vigour and enthusiasm, so much
&Atilde;&copy;lan vital! So much frenzy to catch up on the thousands
and millions of years during which evolution passed it by! Is it at
all possible it would be content with just the level of development
it has reached today? It would show just the sort of upsurge we have
seen--or else it's just on the threshhold of its evolution and
getting ready to rise--and who can say where it will go! These were
the thoughts and observation that Professor Vladim&Atilde;&shy;r Uher
wrote down about this yellowed cutting from an ancient publication,
shaking with the intellectual enthusiasm of a discoverer. I must
publish it in the newspapers, he said to himself, as nobody ever
reads scientific publications. Let everyone know what enormous
events Nature has in store for us! I will entitle it Do Newts have a
Future?</p>

<p>Only, the editor of the <em>Peoples Press</em> looked at Professor
Uher's article and shook his head. Not these newts again! I think
our readers have had it up to their necks with these newts. It's
about time we found something else to write about. And a scientific
article such as this doesn't belong in the papers anyway.</p>

<p>As a result, the article about the development and prospects of
the newts never did appear.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<h4>THE SALAMANDER-SYNDICATE</h4>

<p>President G.H. Bondy rang the bell and stood up.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, "I have the honour of opening this
extraordinary general meeting of the Pacific Export Company. I would
like to welcome everyone here and thank them for the contribution
they make."</p>

<p>"I also," he continued with some emotion, "have the sad duty of
giving you some tragic news. Captain Jan van Toch is no longer with
us. Our founder, if I can call him that, the father of the great
idea of establishing commercial contact with thousands of islands in
the far Pacific, our first captain and enthusiastic fellow worker has
died. He passed away at the start of this year on board our ship,
&Aring; &Atilde;&iexcl;rka, not far from Fanning Island after
suffering a stroke while engaged in his duty." (Bet he made a Hell
of a fuss, poor man, thought Mister Bondy fleetingly.) "Let us now
all stand up in honour of this mans bright memory."</p>

<p>All present stood up with a scraping and clattering of chairs and
then remained in formal silence, all of them united in the hope that
this general meeting wouldn't last too long. (Poor Vantoch, my
friend, thought G.H. Bondy with sincere emotion. What does he look
like now? I expect they put him on a plank and threw him into the
sea--what a splash that must have made! He was certainly a man of
great honour, and had such blue eyes...)</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen," he added briefly, "for showing such piety
in memory of my personal friend, Captain van Toch. I now invite our
director, Mister Volavka, to inform you of the economic prospects for
PEC over the coming year. None of these figures are yet certain but
I hope you won't expect them too have changed too much by the end of
the year. Mister Volavka."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," Mister Volavka began, and off he went. "The
state of the pearl market is very unsatisfactory. Pearl production
last year was nearly twelve times higher than in 1925, which itself
was a very good year, but now the price of pearls has begun a
catastrophic decline, by as much as sixty five percent. Management
has decided, therefore, not to put any of this years pearl harvest on
the market and they will be kept in storage until demand has risen
again. Unfortunately, pearls went out of fashion last autumn,
clearly because they had sunk so low in price. Our Amsterdam branch
has, at present, more than two hundred thousand pearls in stock
which, for the time being, are next to impossible to sell.</p>

<p>"At the same time," Mister Volavka purred on, "there has been a
marked reduction in the number of pearls found this year. Many
fisheries have had to be abandoned because production was too low.
Fisheries discovered just two or three years ago seem to be more or
less exhausted. It is for this reason that the management had
decided to turn its attention to other fruits of the sea such as
coral and shellfish. There has been some success in stimulating the
market for coral jewellery and other ornaments, but even here coral
from Italy is achieving greater success than that from the Pacific.
The management is also studying the possibility of intensive fishing
in the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean, where the main
consideration is how to transport the fish from the Pacific to the
European and American markets; results and findings so far are not
very encouraging.</p>

<p>"On the other hand," the director went on, his voice rising
slightly, "our relatively high turnover suggests it might be
profitable to diversify into other activities such as the export of
textiles, enamel ware, wireless sets and gloves to the Pacific.
islands. This business would be amenable to further development;
although this year it is already showing a slight loss. there is of
course no question of PEC paying any dividend to its shareholders at
the end of the year; and the management would like to announce in
advance that, on this occasion, it will renounce any commissions and
bonuses..."</p>

<p>There was a painful silence in the room. (It must have been like
this on Fanning Island, thought G.H. Bondy. He died a true sailor,
Vantoch. A good man. It's a pity a decent chap like that had to
die. And he wasn't even that old...he was no older than I am...)
Dr. Hubka stood up to speak; and the minutes of the extraordinary
general meeting of the Pacific Export Company continued thus:</p>

<p>Dr. Hubka asks whether the PEC might go into liquidation</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy replies that management has decided to wait for further
suggestions in that matter.</p>

<p>Monsieur Louis Bonenfant urges that pearl production should have
been done under the supervision of permanent representatives,
continuously on site at fisheries, who would check whether pearls
were being gathered with enough vigour and specialist skill.</p>

<p>Mr. Volavka, director, observes that this has been considered, but
it was thought that this would result in excessive administration
costs. There would need to be at least three hundred agents on the
payroll; there was also the question of how these agents would
themselves be supervised to ensure that all pearls found were passed
on to the company.</p>

<p>M.H. Brinkelaer asks whether the newts can be relied on to pass on
all the pearls found by them, and whether they do not dispose of them
to somebody not connected with the company.</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy observes that this is the first time the newts have
been mentioned in public. It has been a rule in this place, up till
now, not to mention any details of how the gathering of pearls is
carried out. He points out that it was for this reason that the
inconspicuous title of Pacific Export Company chosen.</p>

<p>M.H. Brinkelaer asks whether it is unacceptable, in this place, to
talk about matters which affect the interests of the company, and
which moreover have long been known by the general public.</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy replies that it is not unacceptable, but it is
unprecedented. He welcomes that fact that it is now possible to
speak openly. In reply to Mister Brinkelaer's first question, he can
state that as far as he knows there is no reason to doubt the total
honesty of the newts and their willingness to work at gathering
pearls and corals. We must however reckon on known pearl fisheries
becoming effectively exhausted in the near future. Where new
fisheries are concerned, it was on a journey to find islands which
are so far unexploited that our unforgettable colleague, Captain van
Toch, died. It has so far been found impossible to find another man
with the same experience and the same unshakeable honesty and love
for his work to replace him.</p>

<p>Colonel D.W. Bright fully acknowledges the services rendered by
the late Captain van Toch. He points out, however, that the captain,
whose loss we all regret, did show too much concern for the comfort
of the aforementioned newts. (Agreement) It was not necessary, for
instance, to provide the news with knives and other equipment of such
high quality as the late van Toch did. There was no need, for
instance, to give them so much food. There is scope for substantial
reductions in the costs associated with the maintenance of the newts
and in this way raise the net income of the company. (Lively
applause)</p>

<p>Vice-president J. Gilbert agrees with Colonel Bright, but points
out that that was not possible while Captain van Toch was still
alive. Captain van Toch insisted that he had his personal
obligations towards the newts. There were various reasons why it
would have been inadvisable to even suggest neglecting the old mans
wishes in this respect.</p>

<p>Kurt von Frisch asks whether the newts could not be employed in
some other way that might be more profitable than pearl fishing.
Their natural, one could say beaver-like, talent for building weirs
and other underwater constructions should be taken into account.
They could perhaps be put to use in deepening harbours, building
piers and performing other technical tasks underwater.</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy states that management is actively engaged in this
consideration; there are some great possibilities in this respect.
He states that the company now owns nearly six million newts; if we
consider that one pair of newts might have a hundred tadpoles in any
given year the company could well have three hundred million newts at
its disposal by this time next year; in ten years the number would be
astronomical. G.H. Bondy asks what the company intends to do with
this enormous number of newts, when the newt farms are already
over-populated and, because of a lack of natural foodstuffs, it has
been found necessary to feed the newts with copra, potatoes, maize
and similar.</p>

<p>K. von Frisch asks whether the newts are edible.</p>

<p>J. Gilbert: not at all. Nor do their hides have any use.</p>

<p>M. Bonenfant asks management what they now intend to do.</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy (standing): "Gentlemen, we convened this extraordinary
general meeting in order publicly to draw your attention to the
extremely unfavourable prospects of our company which--I hope you
will allow me to remind you of this--has proudly paid returns of
twenty to twenty-three percent over recent years as well as having
well funded reserves and low costs. We stand now at a turning point;
the way of doing business which has proved itself so well over recent
years is now practically at an end; we have no choice but to find new
ways." (Loud applause)</p>

<p>"I could even say it is a sign from fate that our excellent friend
and captain, J. van Toch, left us just at this time. Our romantic,
beautiful--I could even say absurd--trading in pearls was always
closely connected with him. I consider this to be the closing
chapter in our business; it had its, so to speak, exotic charm, but
it was never suitable for modern times. Gentlemen, pearls could
never be the concern of a large company which needs to be cohesive
horizontally and vertically. For me personally, this affair with
pearls was never more than a minor distraction." (Discomfiture) "Yes
gentlemen; but a minor distraction which brought substantial profits
to me and to you. At the start of our business these newts also had
a kind of, shall I say, charm of the new. Three hundred million
newts will not have much charm about them." (Laughter)</p>

<p>"I spoke earlier about finding new ways of moving forward. While
my good friend, Captain van Toch, was still alive there was no
question of giving our affairs any other character than that which
could be called the Captain van Toch style." (Why not?) "Because,
gentlemen, I have too much good taste to mix one style with another.
I would say that the style of Captain van Toch was that of a romantic
adventurer. It was the style of Jack London, Joseph Conrad and
others of that ilk. Old-fashioned, exotic, colonial, almost heroic.
I do not deny that he charmed me with this style of his, but since
his death we no longer have the right to continue with an epic tale
which is adventurous and juvenile. We have before us not a new
chapter but a new conception, gentlemen, it is a job for an
imagination which is new and fundamentally different." (You speak as
if this were all just a story in a novel!) "Yes, gentlemen, you are
quite right. I take an artists interest in business. Without a
sense of art it is impossible ever to think of something new. We
need to be poets if we are to keep the world moving." (Applause)</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy bows. "Gentlemen, I am sorry to be closing this
chapter, the chapter we might call the van Toch era; an era in which
we made use of the child-like and adventurous side that we all have.
The time has come now to bring this fairy story of pearls and coral
fisheries to an end. Sinbad is dead, gentlemen. And the question
is, what now?" (Well that's just what were asking!) "Alright
gentlemen: please take out pen and paper and write this down. Six
million. Have you got that down? Multiply that by fifty. That
makes three hundred million, doesn't it. Multiply that by another
fifty. Now that's fifteen thousand million, yes? And now gentlemen,
please be so kind as to tell me what, in three years time, were going
to do with fifteen thousand million newts. How are we to employ
them, how are we going to feed them, and so on." (Let them die,
then!) "Yes, but don't you think that would be a pity? Have you not
thought that every new newt is a new business opportunity, a new unit
of labour waiting to be put to use? Gentlemen, with six million
newts we can still make business of some sort. With three hundred
million it will be somewhat harder. But gentlemen, fifteen thousand
million newts is something quite inconceivable. The newts will
devour the company. That is how it is." (And you will be
responsible! It was you who started all this business with the
newts!)</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy raises his head. "And I fully accept that
responsibility, gentlemen. Anyone who wishes to can dispose of his
shares in the Pacific Export Company immediately. I am quite willing
to pay for them..." (How much?) "Their full value."
(Consternation.  Chairman calls for ten minute pause)</p>

<p>After pause, H. Brinkelaer speaks. Expresses pleasure at high
rate of increase of newts, and with it the rate of increase of
company assets. But, gentlemen, it would of course be sheer madness
to breed them without regard for the need; suggests on behalf of
shareholders that if the company cannot find suitable work for them
itself they should be simply sold as working force to whoever wishes
to undertake any work on or under water. (Applause) The cost of
feeding a newt is no more than a few centimes; if a pair of newts is
sold for, say, a hundred francs, and the working life of a newt is no
more than, say, one year, then any investor would see a very good
return. (Signs of agreement)</p>

<p>J. Gilbert indicates that newts reach ages much higher than one
year; we do not yet have enough experience with them to say how long
they actually live.</p>

<p>H. Brinkelaer modifies his suggestion; the price of a pair of
newts should be set at three hundred francs.</p>

<p>S. Weissberger asks what sort of work the newts are actually
capable of.</p>

<p>Mr. Volavka, director: with their natural instincts and their
exceptional technical training, the newts would be especially suited
to the construction of weirs, embankments and breakwaters, to the
deepening of harbours and channels, clearing shallow waters and
removal of sediments, and to freeing water channels; they could
reinforce and maintain shorelines, extend sea defences, and so on.
For work of this sort they would operate in groups of hundreds or
thousands of individuals; in projects on this large a scale, where
not even modern plant and machinery could be considered, there would
be no other way of performing the task at such low cost. (Quite
right! Excellent!)</p>

<p><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Dr. Hubka</span> objects
that by selling newts that might find new places to reproduce the
company might lose its monopoly on the animals. He suggests the
newts be merely rented out to businesses engaged in water works as
properly trained and qualified working units with the stipulation
that any tadpoles created will continue to be the property of
PEC.</p>

<p>Mr. Volavka, director, points out that it would not be possible to
supervise millions or even thousands of millions of newts in the
water, let alone their tadpoles; many newts have already been
misappropriated for zoos and menageries.</p>

<p>Col. D.W. Bright: Only male newts should be sold or rented out so
that they would not be able to reproduce outside the farms and
incubators belonging to the company.</p>

<p>Mr. Volavka, director: It is not possible to assert that newt
farms are the property of the company. A piece of the sea floor
cannot be owned or rented. The question of who the newts belong to,
if for instance they are living in the surface waters of Her Majesty
the Queen of Holland, is very unclear, legally speaking, and could
lead to many disputes. (Unease.) In most cases we don't even have
any guaranteed fishing rights; in fact, gentlemen, we established our
newt farms in the Pacific islands without any legal right to do so.
(Growing unease.)</p>

<p>J. Gilbert, responding to Colonel Bright, says that experience so
far showed that male newts kept in isolation become lethargic and
unwilling to work; they are lazy, apathetic and often die from
stress.</p>

<p>Von Frisch asks whether newts to be sold could not be castrated or
sterilised beforehand.</p>

<p>J. Gilbert: That would incur too many costs; there simply is no
way for us to prevent newts from procreating after they have been
sold.</p>

<p>S. Weissberger, asks, as a member of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, that if any newts are to be sold it
should be done humanely and in a way that would not offend people's
sensibilities.</p>

<p>J. Gilbert thanks him for raising the subject; it is understood
that the newts would be caught and transported only by trained
personnel under proper supervision. It is not, of course, possible
to be sure how the newts will be treated by the businesses that buy
them.</p>

<p>S. Weissberger declares that he is satisfied with the assurances
given by Vice-President Gilbert. (Applause.)</p>

<p>G.H. Bondy: "Gentlemen, we have, from now on, to abandon any idea
of having a monopoly on newts. Unfortunately, under current
regulations, we are not able to take out a patent on them."
(Laughter.) "We can and must do business with newts in a way that's
fundamentally different from the way we have been up till now; and it
is essential that our approach to business is fundamentally different
and on a far bigger scale." (Hear hear!) "And there are many
things, gentlemen, that need to be agreed beforehand. Management
suggest the creation of a new, vertically organised trust under the
name Salamander Syndicate. Besides our company, the members of the
newt syndicate would consist of certain major companies and strong
financial groups; there is one company, for instance, that would be
engaged in manufacturing special, patented metal tools for the newts
..." (MEAS, you mean?)  "Yes, that's right, MEAS is the company I
have in mind. There will also be a cartel of companies in the field
of chemicals and foodstuffs, manufacturing cheap, patented feed for
the newts; there will be a group of transport companies, making use
of experience already gained to patent special hygienic tanks for
transporting the newts; a block of insurance companies to cover the
newts against risk of death or injury during transportation or at the
workplace; other interested concerns in the fields of industry,
export and finance which, for legal reasons, we are not able to
mention by name at this stage. Suffice it to say, gentlemen, that at
the start of business the syndicate would have four hundred millions
pounds sterling at its disposal." (Excitement) "This file, my
friends, is already full of contracts and all they need now is a
signature for the creation of one of the biggest commercial
organisations of modern times. All that is asked of you by the
management, gentlemen is that you give them the authority to
establish this gigantic concern whose task will be to cultivate and
employ the newts in the best possible way." (Applause and voices of
protest).</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, please bear in mind the advantages a collaboration of
this sort could bring. The Newt Syndicate would provide more than
just newts, it would also provide equipment and food for the newts
such as maize, carbohydrates, beef fat and sugar for thousands of
millions of well fed animals; then there would be transport,
insurance, veterinary needs and everything at the lowest rate
guaranteed for us if not by a monopoly then at least by being in a
dominant position over any other potential rival that might want to
deal in newts. Just let them try it, gentlemen; they won't be in
competition with us for long." (Bravo!) "But that's not all. The
Newt syndicate would provide all kinds of building material for
underwater work performed by the newts; for this reason we have the
support also of heavy industry, cement works, the stone and timber
industries..." (You still don't know how the newts are going to
work!) "Gentlemen, at this very moment there are twelve thousand
newts at work in Saigon building new docks, basins and jetties."
(You didn't tell us about that!) "No. This is our first large scale
experiment, and it has been a complete success, meeting all our hopes
and expectations. Without any hint of a doubt, the future belongs to
newts." (Enthusiastic applause)</p>

<p>"And that's not all, gentlemen. There are still many more
functions for the Newt Syndicate to perform. the salamander
syndicate will seek out work for millions of newts all round the
world. They will provide the plans and the ideas for subjugating the
oceans. It will disseminate ideas of Utopia, dreams that are
gigantic, projects for new coastlines and shipping lanes, causeways
that will join continents, whole chains of artificial islands for
journeys to new lands in the middle of the oceans. That is where the
future of mankind lies. Gentlemen, four fifths of the Earths surface
is covered by sea; there's no denying that that is too much; the
surface of our world, the map of sea and land, must be corrected. We
are giving the world the workers of the sea, gentlemen. Well no
longer be doing it in the style of Captain van Toch with his
adventurous tales of pearls and treasure but by the tried and tested
means of honest toil. We can be mere shopkeepers or we can be more
creative; but if we fail to think in terms of oceans and continents
we won't have fulfilled out promise. Somebody earlier on mentioned
the difficulty of selling a pair of newts. I would rather we thought
in terms of thousands of millions of newts, of millions and millions
of workers, of moving the crust of the Earth itself, a new Genesis
and a new geological age. We have today the chance to talk of a new
Atlantis, of ancient continents extending further and further out
into the seas, a new world created by man himself. Forgive me,
gentlemen, if all this seems Utopian, but we are indeed stepping out
into a Utopia. We have already entered in, my friends. All we need
to do is work out what technical jobs need to be done by the newts
..." (And the economics!)</p>

<p>"Yes. The economics of all this are especially important.
Gentlemen, our company is too small to be able to make use of
thousands of millions of newts by itself; we don't have the money for
it nor the influence. If the map of the seas and the land is to be
changed we need also to have the greatest powers in the world taking
an interest. But that can be left till later; there is still no need
to name what high places have already shown positive interest in the
syndicate. But for now, all I ask of you, gentlemen, is that you do
not lose sight of the boundless scope of the affair you are about to
vote on." (Enthusiastic and sustained applause. Excellent!
Bravo!)</p>

<p>It was nonetheless necessary, before the vote was held, to promise
that shares of the Pacific Export Company would pay a dividend of at
least ten percent this year from its reserves. The vote was then
eighty-seven percent in favour of the Newt Syndicate and only
thirteen percent against. As a result the management's proposal was
accepted. The Salamander Syndicate came into life. G.H. Bondy was
congratulated.</p>

<p>"That was a very good speech, Mister Bondy," old Sigi Weissberger
praised. ""Very good. And please, tell me, how did you get the
idea?"</p>

<p>"How?" G.H. Bondy replied absent mindedly. "Actually, to tell you
the truth Mister Weissberger, it was all because of old van Toch. He
was always so fond of his newts--what would the poor man have said
if we just let those tapa-boys of his die out or be killed?"</p>

<p>"Tapa-boys? What do you mean, tapa-boys?"</p>

<p>"All those vile newts. At least they'll be treated decently now
that they're worth money. And we might as well use them to create a
utopia as the horrors are no good for anything else."</p>

<p>"I don't see what you mean," Mr. Weissberger said. "Have you ever
actually seen one of the newts, Mr. Bondy? I don't really know what
they're like. What do they look like?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I really can't tell you, Mr. Weissberger. How should
I know what a newt looks like? Do you think I have the time to
bother about what they look like? I'm just glad we've got the Newt
Syndicate sorted out."</p>

<h3>(Supplementary Chapter)</h3>

<h4>The sex life of the newts. </h4>

<p>One of mans favourite activities is to imagine how the world
might be in the distant future, what technical wonders will have been
perfected, what social problems solved, how far science and civil
organisation will have progressed, and so on. But however much
improved, progressed or at least more technically perfect these
utopias are, they never fail to take a lively interest in the
question of how one of the most ancient of institutions might be.
Sex, reproduction, love, marriage, family, the status of women and so
on are as popular now as they have always been. Consider, in this
respect, the works of Paul Adam, HG. Wells, Aldous Huxley and many
others.</p>

<p>Taking his example from these authors, and considering that
he has already begun to speculate of the future of our planet, the
present author regards it as his duty to speculate on what the sexual
behaviour of the newts will be. He will settle the matter now so
that he will not have to return to it later. In its basic outlines,
the sex life of Andrias Scheuchzeri is, of course, no different from
that of other tailed amphibians; there is no copulation in the proper
sense of the word, the female carries the ova through several stages
of their development, the fertilised ova develop into tadpoles in the
water and so on; this is something that can be found in any primer of
biology. So let us refer then to just a few peculiarities which have
been observed in Andrias Scheuchzeri.</p>

<p>According to the account given by H. Bolte, the male and
female come together in early April; the male will usually remain
with just one female throughout any one mating season, and for a
period of several days will never leave her side. He will take no
sustenance during this period, whereas the female will evince a
voracious appetite. The male will pursue the female in the water and
attempt to keep his head closely beside hers. If he is successful in
this, then he will position his paw in front of her snout in order to
prevent escape. He will then become stiff. In this way, with male
and female in contact only at the head while their bodies form an
angle of approximately thirty degrees, the two animals will float
motionless side by side in the water. After a short time has
elapsed, the male will begin to convulse with sufficient vigour for
their two bodies to collide; after which he will again become stiff,
his limbs extended to each side, and touching only the head of his
chosen mate with his paw. During this, the female shows a total
indifference apart from eating whatever comes within range. This, if
we may call it thus, kissing lasts several days; at times the female
will pull herself away in pursuit of food, at which the male will
pursue in a state of clear agitation if not fury. Eventually the
female ceases to show further resistance or attempt to remove herself
from the male and the couple will remain floating motionless,
resembling a pair of black logs attached to each other in the water.
The body of the male will then begin to undergo cramps and
convulsions, during which he will discharge large amounts of somewhat
sticky foam into the water, immediately after which he will abandon
the female and climb away between the rocks and stones in a state of
extreme exhaustion; during this period it is possible for the
observer to cut off a leg or tail without his showing any kind of
defensive reaction.</p>

<p>The female will remain for some time in her stiff and
motionless posture; she will then show vigorous movement and
discharge from her cloaca a chain of eggs inside a gelatinous
covering, making frequent use of her rear limbs to assist this
process in the way seen among toads. The eggs number between forty
and fifty and hang from the female's body. She will swim with them
to a safe place and attach them to seaweed, algae or simply to a
rock. After a period of ten days, the female will bear another
litter of twenty to thirty eggs without any union with the male
having taken place; it seems clear that the eggs were fertilised
within the cloaca. There will usually be a third and a fourth
discharge of eggs after a period of seven or eight days, each of
fifteen to twenty eggs variously fertilised. The feather-gilled
tadpoles will emerge after a gestation period of between one and
three weeks. The tadpoles grow into adult newts after just one year
and are able to reproduce in their turn.</p>

<p>The behaviour observed by Miss Blanche Kistemaeckers of two
newts in captivity was somewhat different. At the time of spawning
the male approached only one female and pursued her quite brutally;
when she escaped from him he beat her with heavy blows of his tail.
He disapproved when she tried to take food and drove her away from
it; it was clear he wanted to have her just for himself and simply
terrorised her.  Once he had discharged his milt he threw himself on
another female and tried to eat her, so that he had to be taken from
the tank and placed somewhere else. This second female nonetheless
produced fertile eggs, numbering sixty-three in total. Miss
Kistemaeckers noticed that the cloaca of all three animals was very
sore, and she writes that fertilisation of the ova of Andrias
Scheuchzeri seems to take place not by copulation, nor even spawning,
but by what she called the sexual milieu. It is already evident that
the two sexes need not come together at an appropriate time for
fertilisation of the eggs to take place.  This led the young
researcher to carry out further experiments. She separated the two
sexes; at the appropriate time she extracted the sperm from the male
and put it into the water where the females were, at which the
females began to discharge fertilised eggs. In another experiment
Miss Kistemaeckers filtered the semen to remove the sperm; this gave
a clear, slightly acidic liquid which she put into the females water;
the females then began to discharge eggs, about fifty at a time, of
which most were fertile and produced normal tadpoles.  This is what
led Miss Kistemaeckers to the important notion of the sexual milieu,
which can be seen as a process in its own right, existing between
parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction. The eggs are fertilised
simply by a change in the chemical environment (a certain level of
acidity, which has not so far been successfully created
artificially), which is somehow connected with the sexual functions
of the male although these functions themselves are not essential;
the fact that the male does conjoin with the female is clearly no
more than a vestige of an earlier stage of evolution when Andrias
reproduced in the same way as other newts. Miss Kistemaeckers
rightly observes that this form of mating is peculiar, some kind of
inherited illusion of paternity; the male is not the real father of
the tadpoles but only an impersonal provider of the chemical
environment which is what really fertilises the ova. If we had a
hundred newt couples together in a tank it would be tempting to think
that a hundred individual acts of mating would take place; but in
fact there will be just the one, a collective a sexualisation of the
given environment or, to put it more precisely, the acidification of
the water to which the mature eggs of the species will respond by
developing into tadpoles. If this unknown acidification agent can be
created artificially there will be no more need of males. So the sex
life of this remarkable species is actually no more than an illusion;
the erotic passion, the pair-bonding and sexual tyranny, fidelity for
the time needed, the slow and cumbersome act of intercourse, all
these things are actually unnecessary and no more than an outdated
and almost symbolic act which, so to speak, decorates the impersonal
creation by the male of the procreative environment. The strange
indifference shown by the female to the frantic and pointless
activity of the male is clear evidence that she instinctively feels
that it is nothing more than a formal ceremony or a prelude to the
real love-making when they conjoin with the fertilising medium; it
could almost be said that the female of Andrias Scheuchzeri
understands this state of affairs clearly and goes through it
objectively without any erotic illusions.</p>

<p>(The experiments performed by Miss Kistemaeckers was followed
up with some interesting research by the learned Abb&Atilde;&copy;
Bontempelli. Having prepared some dried and powdered milt from
Andrias he put it in the female's water, who then began to discharge
fertile eggs. He obtained the same result if he dried and powdered
Andrias's male organ or if he took an extract in alcohol or by
infusion and poured it into the female's water. He tried the same
experiment, with the same result, when he took an extract of the
male's pituitary gland and even when he took a scraping from the
males skin, if taken in the rutting season. In all these cases, the
females did not respond at first, but after a while they stopped
seeking food and became stiff and motionless in the water, then after
some hours they began to discharge eggs in a gelatinous coating, each
about the size of pig's droppings.)</p>

<p>While discussing this matter, it will be necessary to
describe the strange ceremony which became known as the dance of the
salamanders. (This does not refer to the Salamander Dance which came
into fashion around this time, especially in high society, and which
Bishop Hiram declared to be the most depraved dance he had ever heard
described.) The dance took place on evenings when there was a full
moon (apart from in the breeding season). The males, and only the
males, of Andrias would appear on the beach, form themselves into a
circle and begin a strange, wave-like twisting and bending of the
upper half of the body.  This movement was typical of these giant
newts at all times, but during these dances it develops into a wild
passion, something like the dances of dervishes. Some researchers
regard this frenzied twisting and stamping as a kind of cult of the
moon, which would mean it is a kind of religious ceremony; on the
other hand some researchers see the dance as essentially erotic in
character and seek to explain it primarily in terms of the peculiar
sexual procedures described above. We have already said that the
female of Andrias Scheuchzeri is fertilised by the so-called sexual
milieu surrounding males and females rather than by the personal
conjoining of individual males and females. It was also said that
the females accept this impersonal sexual relationship far more
realistically and routinely than the males who, clearly for reasons
of instinctive vanity and greed, try to maintain at least the
illusion of sexual triumph, leading them to play a role that involves
betrothal and a husband's authority. This is one of the greatest
erotic illusions to be found, and it is interesting that the illusion
is corrected by these grand male ceremonies which seem to be nothing
less than an instinctive attempt to reinforce their sense of
belonging to a Male Collective. It is thought that this collective
dance has the function of overcoming that atavistic and nonsensical
illusion of the males sexual individuality; this whirling,
inebriating, frenetic gang is nothing other than the Collective Male,
the Collective Bridegroom and the Great Copulator that carries out
its celebratory wedding dance and abandons itself to the great
nuptial rite--and all the time the females are strangely excluded
and left to squelch lethargically over the fish or mollusc they have
eaten. The famous Charles J. Powell, who gave this newt ritual the
name, Dance of the Male Principle, writes: "And in this ritual of
male togetherness, do we not see the root and origin of the
remarkable collectivism shown by the newts? Let us be aware that
true animal society is only to be found where life and development of
the species are not built on sexual pair-bonding, such as we see
among bees and ants and termites. The society of the bee-hive can be
described thus: I, the Mother Hive. In the case of the newts, their
society must be described quite differently: We, the Male Principle.
It is only when the males mass together at the right time and
virtually perspire the fertilising sexual milieu that they become the
Great Male which enters the womb of the female and generously
multiplies life. Their paternity is collective; and for this reason
their entire nature is collective and expresses itself in collective
activity, whereas the females, once they have laid their eggs, lead a
life that remains dispersed and solitary until the following spring.
It is the males alone that create the community, the males alone that
carry out collective tasks. There is no other species of animal
wherein the female plays such a subordinate role as Andrias; they are
excluded from communal activities and show not the slightest interest
in them. Their moment comes only when the Male Principle imbues
their environment with a chemical acidity that is barely perceptible,
but which has such power of penetration, such &Atilde;&copy;lan
vital, that it is effective even when the currents and tides of the
oceans have diluted it to almost nothing. It is as if the Ocean
itself were the male, fertilising millions of embryos on its
shores.</p>

<p>"However vainly the cock might crow," Charles J. Powell
continued, "it is to the female that in, most species, nature has
given the dominant role in life. The male is there for his own
passion and to kill; he is pompous and arrogant, while the female
represents the species in all its strength and lasting nobility. In
the case of Andrias (and often in the case of man) the relationship
is fundamentally different; by the creation of a masculine society
and solidarity the male acquires clear biological dominance and
determines how the species will develop to a far greater extent than
the female. It may well be because of this marked male input to the
direction of development that Andrias has so excelled in technical
matters, which are talents typical of the male. Andrias is by nature
a technologist and tends towards group activities; these secondary
features of the male, by which I mean a talent for technology and a
flair for organisation, has, before our very eyes, developed with
such speed and such success that we would be compelled to speak of a
miracle were we not aware of what a powerful force in life sexual
determination is. Andrias Scheuchzeri is animal faber, and it is
even possible that he will one day surpass man himself given enough
time. All this is the result of one fact of nature; that they have
created a society that is purely male."</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<h4>MISTER POVONDRA READS THE PAPER</h4>

<p>There are people who collect stamps, and others who collect first
editions. Mr. Povondra, the doorman at the house of G.H. Bondy, had
long been unable to find any meaning in his life; he had been
wondering for years whether to become interested in prehistoric
graves or develop a passion for international politics; but one
evening, without any sort of warning, he suddenly knew what he had so
far been lacking, what would make his life worthwhile. Great events
usually come without any sort of warning.</p>

<p>That evening Mister Povondra was reading the paper, Mrs. Povondra
was darning Frank's socks and Frank was pretending to study the
tributaries on the left bank of the Danube. It was pleasantly
quiet.</p>

<p>"I should have known," muttered Mister Povondra.</p>

<p>"What should you have known?" asked Mrs. Povondra as she lifted a
thread.</p>

<p>"About these newts," said Father Povondra. "It says here that
they've sold seventy million of them over the last three months."</p>

<p>"That's a lot, isn't it!" said Mrs. Povondra.</p>

<p>"I should think so. In fact that's an astonishing number,
Mother. Just think, seventy million!" Mister Povondra turned to
look at her. "They must have made a fortune selling all of them!
And there's all the work they're doing now," he added after thinking
for a moment. "It says here that they're claiming new land and
building new islands everywhere at an amazing rate.--People can
create as much new land as they want now, I should think. This is
wonderful, Mother. I'm telling you, this is a bigger step forward
than the discovery of America." Mister Povondra thought about this
for a while. "A new period of history, don't you think? What shall
we do, Mother, we're living in great times."</p>

<p>There was once more a long period of homely silence. Father
Povondra suddenly started drawing harder on his pipe. "And just
think, if it wasn't for me it would never have happened!"</p>

<p>"What would never have happened?"</p>

<p>"All this business with the newts. This new period of history.
If you look at it properly, it was actually me who put it all
together."</p>

<p>Mrs. Povondra looked up from the holes in the socks. "How's that,
then?"</p>

<p>"That it was me who let that captain in to see Mister Bondy on
that day. If I hadn't announced him there was no way the captain
could ever have met Mister Bondy. If it hadn't been for me, Mother,
nothing could ever have come of it. Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Maybe this captain could have found someone else," Mrs. Povondra
objected.</p>

<p>Mister Povondra rattled indignantly on his pipe. "Now what do
you know about that sort of thing? It's only Mister G.H. Bondy who
could do a thing like that. He has more foresight than I don't know
who. Anyone else would just have thought it was all madness or a
confidence trick; but not Mister Bondy! He's got a nose for these
things, girl!" Mister Povondra considered this for a while. "That
captain, what was his name again, Vantoch, he didn't look much. Sort
of fat old man, he was. Any other doorman would have told him he had
no business knocking at the door, the master isn't home, and that
sort of thing; but, you listen, I had some sort of intuition or
something. I announced him to Mister Bondy; I said to myself, Mister
Bondy might be cross with me but I'll take the responsibility on
myself and I'll announce him. I've always said a doorman has to be a
good judge of character. There are times when someone rings at the
door, and he looks just like a lord, and he turns out to be a
refrigerator salesman. And there are other times when some fat old
man turns up at the door, and look what can come of that. You need
to be a good judge of character," Father Povondra mused. "There you
see, Frank, that's the difference a man in a humble position can
make. You take my example, always try your best to do your duty just
like I've always done." Mister Povondra nodded his head in pride and
self congratulation. "I could have turned that captain away at the
gate and saved myself the bother of going down the steps. Any other
doorman wouldn't have cared and shut the gate in his face, he would.
And if he did he'd have ruined this fantastic step forward for
mankind. Always bear in mind, Frank, if everyone in the world did
his duty everything would be alright. And pay attention when I'm
talking to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad," muttered Frank discontentedly.</p>

<p>Father Povondra cleared his throat. "Pass me the scissors,
Mother. I think I'd better cut this article out so that I've always
got something to remind me."</p>

<p>So it was that Mister Povondra started his collection of newspaper
cuttings about the newts. Without his passion as a collector much of
the material we now have would otherwise have been lost. He cut out
and saved everything written about the newts that he could find; it
should even be said that after some initial fumblings he learned to
plunder the newspapers in his favourite caf&Atilde;&copy; wherever
there was mention of the newts and even developed an unusual, almost
magical, virtuosity in tearing the appropriate article out of the
paper and putting it in his pocket right under the nose of the head
waiter. It is well known that all collectors are willing to steal
and murder if that is what's needed to add a certain item to their
collection, but that is not in any way a stain on their moral
character.</p>

<p>His life was now the life of a collector, and that gave it
meaning. Evening after evening he would count and arrange his
cuttings under the indulgent eyes of Mrs. Povondra who knew that
every man is partly mad and partly a little child; it was better for
him to play with his cuttings than to go out drinking and playing
cards. She even made some space in the scullery for all the boxes he
had made himself for his collection; could anything more be asked of
a wife?</p>

<p>Even Mister Bondy was surprised at Mister Povondra's encyclopaedic
knowledge of everything concerning the newts which he showed at every
opportunity. With some embarrassment, Mister Povondra admitted that
he collected everything printed about the salamanders and let Mister
Bondy see his boxes. G.H. Bondy kindly praised him for his
collection; what does it matter that only great men can be so
generous and only powerful people can give pleasure without it
costing them a penny? It's alright for those who are great. Mister
Bondy, for instance, told the office of the Salamander Syndicate to
send Mister Povondra all the cuttings to do with the newts that they
did not need to keep in their archives, and lucky Mister Povondra,
somewhat dismayed, received whole parcels of documents in all the
languages of the world every day. And for documents in the Cyrillic
alphabet, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese script, Bengali, Tamil,
Javanese, Burmese or Taalik he was especially grateful. "When I
think;" he said about it all, "without me it would never have
happened!"</p>

<p>As we have already said, Mister Povondra's collection saved much
historic material concerning the whole story of the newts; but that,
of course, does not mean to say it was enough to satisfy a scientific
historian. Firstly, Mister Povondra had never received a specialist
education as assistant in historic or archival methods, and he made
no indication on his cuttings of the source, or the date, so that we
do not know when or where each document was published. And secondly,
faced with so much material piling up around him, Mister Povondra
kept mainly the longest articles which he considered must be the most
important, while the shorter reports were simply thrown into the coal
scuttle; as a result, through all this period, remarkable few facts
and reports were conserved by him. Thirdly, the hand of Mrs.
Povondra played a considerable part in the matter; when she carefully
filled up one of Mister Povondra's boxes she would quietly and
secretly pull out some of the cuttings and burn them, which took
place several times a year. The only ones she spared were the ones
that did not grow in number very fast, such as the cuttings printed
in the Malabar, Tibetan or Coptic scripts; these remained more or
less complete, although for certain gaps in our body of knowledge
they are not of great value. This means that the material we have
available concerning the history of the newts is very fragmented,
like the land records of the eighth century A.D., or the selected
writings of the poetess, Sappho; but some documents, here and there,
did happen to survive about this phase of the great history of the
world, and despite all the gaps we will do our best to summarise them
under the title <em>The Rise of Civilisation</em>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<h4>THE RISE OF CIVILISATION (History of the Newts) <a href=
"#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></h4>

<p>In the history of the epoch announced by G.H. Bondy at the
memorable general meeting of the Pacific Export Company with his
prophetic words about the coming utopia, <a href=
"#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> it is not possible to measure events in
centuries or even decades, as has been possible in previous ages of
world history. Instead we must measure history in units of three
months, which is how often the quarterly economic statistics appear.
<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a> In this present period, history, so
to speak, is manufactured by mass production; this is why the speed
of history is so much greater (estimated to be approximately
five-fold). It is simply not possible nowadays to wait centuries for
the world to turn into something good or bad. The migrations of
nations, for instance, which at one time was drawn out over several
generations, could be completed within three years using modern
transport methods; otherwise there would be no way of making a profit
from it. The same applies to the decline of the Roman Empire, the
colonisation of continents, the massacre of the Indians and so on.
All this could be completed incomparably faster if put into the hands
of well funded business. In this way, the enormous success of the
Newt Syndicate and its powerful influence on the history of the world
is certainly a sign of things to come.</p>


<p>The history of the newts was characterised from the first by good
and rational organisation and that is primarily, although not solely,
thanks to the Newt Syndicate; it should be acknowledged that science,
philanthropy, education, the press and other factors played a
substantial part in the astonishing expansion and progress of the
newts, but it's still true to say that it was the Newt Syndicate that
conquered new continents and coastlines for them, virtually day by
day, even when they had to overcome many obstacles to their
expansion. <a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> The syndicate's
quarterly statements show that the newts were gradually settled in
the ports of India and China; how colonies of newts overwhelmed the
coasts of Africa and jumped over to America where a new and modern
hatchery soon appeared on the Gulf of Mexico; how, as well as the
broad waves of colonisations, smaller, pioneering groups of newts
were sent out to establish new places for migration. The Newt
Syndicate sent, for instance, a thousand top quality newts as a
present to Waterstaat in Holland, six hundred were given to the city
of Marseilles to clean out the old harbour, and similar presents were
made elsewhere. The dispersion and settlement of the newts around
the world was, unlike the expansion of mankind, simply well planned
and enormous; left to Nature it would certainly have taken thousands
of years; but that is merely hypothetical. Nature has never been so
enterprising and targeted as man's industry and commerce. It seemed
that the lively demand for them had its influence on the newts' own
reproductive abilities; the number of tadpoles produced by any one
female rose to as much as a hundred and fifty per year. Loses to
sharks and other predatory fish were reduced almost to zero after the
newts had been equipped with underwater pistols and dumdum bullets to
protect themselves. <a href="#note5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>



<p>ENGLAND CLOSED OFF TO NEWTS?</p>

<p>(Reuter) In reply to a question in the House of Commons from Mr.
J. Leeds, Sir Samuel Mandeville stated today that His Majesty's
Government had closed the Suez Canal to newt transports of any kind;
he added that no newt would be permitted to be employed on any
shoreline or any sovereign waters of the British Isles. The reason
for this measure, Sir Samuel declared, was partly to do with the
security of the British Isles and partly to do with old statutes
still in force concerning the elimination of slave trading.</p>

<p>In reply to a question from Mr. B. Russel, M.P., Sir Samuel stated
that this position would, of course, not apply to British colonies
and dominions.

<p>The expansion of the newt population did not run smoothly
everywhere, of course; in some places conservative groups took severe
protective measures against the introduction of new workforces,
seeing the newts as competition with human workers; <a href=
"#note6"><sup>6</sup></a> Others expressed the fear that the newts,
living on small marine animals, posed a threat to fishing, there were
those who argued that the newts would undermine coastlines and
islands with their underwater tunnels and passageways. There were
certainly many people who warned against the introduction of the
newts; but whenever any innovation or any progress has been made it
has always met with resistance and mistrust; that was the case with
industrial machinery and it was the case with the newts. In other
places misunderstandings of other sorts appeared, <a href=
"#note7"><sup>7</sup></a> but the news media all round the world, who
understood the enormous commercial possibilities offered by the
newts, provided a great deal of help in these matters and with the
help of effective and large scale advertising campaigns the
salamanders became established all around the globe and were welcomed
with lively interest and even enthusiasm. <a href=
"#note8"><sup>8</sup></a> Trading in newts was mostly in the hands of
the Newt Syndicate, which carried it out with its own specially made
tanker ships; the centre of trading was the Salamander Building in
Singapore which functioned as a kind of newt stock exchange. <a href=
"#note9"><sup>9</sup></a> As the turnover in newts rose, trading, of
course, became very wild; the Newt Syndicate was no longer able to
observe and control all the hatcheries established by the late
Captain van Toch in many places and especially around the small and
remote islands of Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia; many of the
bays inhabited by newts were left to their own devices. As a result,
while the cultivation of salamanders was well organised and
controlled in some areas, in others there was extensive hunting of
wild newts, similar in many ways to the seal hunting expeditions that
used to take place; the hunting expeditions were to some extent
illegal, but as there were no laws protecting the newts no-one was
ever brought to account for anything more serious than setting foot
on the territory of a sovereign state without permission; as the
newts on these islands multiplied at an astonishing rate and now and
then caused damage to the local people's fields and orchards, these
uncontrolled newt hunts were tacitly regarded as a natural way of
regulating the newt population. <a href=
"#note10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Trading in newts was well organised, and there was an extensive
advertising campaign in the press, but the biggest influence in the
expansion of the newt population was the enormous wave of
technological idealism which inundated the entire world at that
time. G.H. Bondy rightly foresaw that from then on the human spirit
would be working with whole new continents and new Atlantisses. The
whole of the Newt Age was dominated by a lively and fertile dispute
among the technically minded as to whether firm land should be
constructed with shores of reinforced concrete or merely light land
laid down as deposits of marine sand. New and gigantic projects
appeared almost every day: there were some Italian engineers who
suggested the construction of a Great Italy taking in most of the
Mediterranean Sea as far as Tripoli, the Balearic Islands and the
Dodecanese, and others who wanted to establish a new continent to be
called 'Lemuria' to the east of Italian Somalia which would take in
the entire Indian Ocean in one move. With the help of armies of
newts, new islands covering thirteen and a half acres were indeed
laid down near the Somalian port of Mogadishu. Japan planned and
partly realised a new great island to cover the former Marian
Archipelago and made preparations to combine the Caroline and
Marshall Islands into two big islands, provisionally named 'New
Nippon'; each of the two islands was to be created by means of an
artificial volcano which would remind their prospective inhabitants
of the famous Mount Fuji. It was also rumoured that German engineers
were secretly building a durable, concrete landmass in the Sargasso
Sea which was to be the new Atlantis and, it was said, would be a
threat to French East Africa; but it seems that this went no further
than laying the foundations. In Holland, Zeeland was reclaimed;
France combined Guadeloupe, Grande Terre, Basse Terre and La
D&Atilde;&copy;sirade into one big island; the United States began to
build the first airfield-island on the 37th. meridian (two storeys
high with an enormous hotel, sport stadium, funfair and a cinema for
five thousand people). It simply seemed that the last limits imposed
on human expansion imposed by the sea had now fallen; a new and
radiant age of amazing technical plans began; man realised that now,
at last, he was becoming the Lord of the World, and that was thanks
to the newts who had stepped onto the world stage at the right moment
and, as it were, with the force of history. There is no doubt that
the newts would never have burgeoned the way they did if our own
technical age had not prepared so many jobs for them and so many
places of long-term employment. The future of the Workers of the Sea
now seemed to be guaranteed for centuries to come.</p>

<p>Science, too, played an important part in the development of newt
commerce, and quickly turned its attention to investigating both the
newts' physiology and their psychology. <a href=
"#note11"><sup>11</sup></a> Because of this scientific research
people stopped regarding the newts as some kind of miracle; in the
cold light of science the salamanders lost much of their aura of
primordial strangeness and uniqueness; once they had become the
subject of psychological tests they began to seem very average and
uninteresting; their enormous talents were dismissed by the
scientists to the realm of myth. The common or garden salamander was
identified, and it turned out to be something entirely dull and quite
limited in its abilities; only the newspapers would now and then
display a Miracle Newt that could multiply five figure numbers in its
head, but people soon got tired of that, especially when it had been
shown that even a mere human could perform the same trick given the
right training. People simply began to consider the newts as much a
matter of course as an adding machine or other device; they now no
longer saw anything mysterious about them, the newts no longer seemed
to have emerged from the unknown depths of the sea with who knows
what purpose. And people never do regard something as mysterious if
it serves and benefits them, only if it's something harmful or
threatening; and as the newts, as has been shown, were highly
versatile and useful, <a href="#note12"><sup>12</sup></a> they were
simply accepted as a basic part of a rational and ordinary life.</p>



<p>In short, it was entirely natural that the newts stopped being a
sensation, even though there were now as many as a hundred million of
them; the public interest they had excited had been the interest of a
novelty. They still appeared now and then in films (Sally and Andy,
the Two Good Salamanders) and on the cabaret stage where singers
endowed with an especially bad voice came on in the role of newts
with rasping voices and atrocious grammar, but as soon as the newts
had become a familiar and large-scale phenomenon the problems they
presented, so to speak, were of a different character. <a href=
"#note13"><sup>13</sup></a> Although the great newt sensation quickly
evaporated it was replaced with something that was somewhat more
solid--the Newt Question. Not for the first time in the history of
mankind, the most vigorous activist in the Newt Question was of
course a woman. This was Mme. Louise Zimmermann, the manager of a
guest house for girls in Lausanne, who, with exceptional and
boundless energy, propagated this noble maxim around the world: Give
the newts a proper education! She would tirelessly draw attention
both to the newts' natural abilities and to the danger that might
arise for human civilisation if the salamanders weren't carefully
taught to reason and to understand morals, but it was long before she
met with anything but incomprehension from the public. <a href=
"#note14"><sup>14</sup></a> "Just as the Roman culture disappeared
under the onslaught of the barbarians our own educated civilisation
will disappear if it is allowed to become no more than an island in a
sea of beings that are spiritually enslaved, our noble ideals cannot
be allowed to become dependent on them," she prophesied at six
thousand three hundred and fifty seven lectures that she delivered at
women's institutes all over Europe, America, Japan, China, Turkey and
elsewhere. "If our culture is to survive there must be education for
all. We cannot have any peace to enjoy the gifts of our civilisation
nor the fruits of our culture while all around us there are millions
and millions of wretched and inferior beings artificially held down
in the state of animals. Just as the slogan of the nineteenth
century was 'Freedom for Women', so the slogan of our own age must be
'GIVE THE NEWTS A PROPER EDUCATION!'" And on she went. Thanks to
her eloquence and her incredible persistence, Mme. Louise Zimmermann
mobilised women all round the world and gathered sufficient funds to
enable her to found the First Newt Lyceum at Beaulieu (near Nice),
where the tadpoles of salamanders working in Marseilles and Toulon
were instructed in French language and literature, rhetoric, public
behaviour, mathematics and cultural history. <a href=
"#note15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Girls' School for Newts in Menton was
slightly less successful, as the staple courses in music, diet and
cookery and fine handwork (which Mme. Zimmermann insisted on for
primarily pedagogical reasons) met with a remarkable lack of
enthusiasm, if not with a stubborn hostility among its young
students. In contrast with this, though, the first public
examinations for young newts was such an instant and startling
success that they were quickly followed by the establishment of the
Marine Polytechnic for Newts at Cannes and the Newts' University at
Marseilles with the support of the society for the care and
protection of animals; it was at this university that the first newt
was awarded a doctorate of law.</p>


<p>The matter of newt education now began to develop quickly and
along its normal path. Exemplary though the &Atilde;&permil;coles
Zimmermann were, the most progressive teachers raised a number of
serious objections to them; in particular they insisted that the
established humanistic schooling for young humans was not suitable
for young newts; they certainly recommended the teaching of
literature and history but they also recommended that as much time
and facilities as possible should be devoted to modern practical
subjects such as the natural sciences, craftwork, technical
understanding, physical education and so on. These Reform Schools,
or Schools for Practical Life, as they were known were, in their
turn, passionately opposed by those who supported a classical
education and declared that newts could only come to approach the
lofty cultural level of human beings on the basis of Latin, and that
there was no point in teaching them to speak if they weren't also
taught to recite poetry and perform oratory with the eloquence of
Cicero. There was a long and rather heated debate which was finally
settled when the schools for salamanders were taken over by the state
and schools for human children were reformed so that they came as
close as possible to the ideals of the Reform Schools for newts.</p>

<p>It was now a matter of course that other countries would also
declare their belief in making the newts have a proper, state
supervised education. One by one, all the seafaring nations declared
themselves for it (with the exception of Great Britain, of course);
and because these schools for newts were not burdened with the
classical traditions of schools for human children, and were able to
make use of all the latest methods in psychotechnology, technical
education, pre-military exercises and other educational innovations,
these schools quickly evolved into the most modern and scientifically
advanced educational system in the world, envied by teachers and
students everywhere.</p>

<p>As soon as there are schools there needs to be a language, and
that raised the question of which of the world's languages would be
the best for the salamanders to learn. The first newts in the
Pacific islands spoke, of course, in the Pidgin English they had
picked up from natives and sailors; many of them spoke Malay or other
local dialects. Newts bred for the market in Singapore were taught
to speak Basic English, the scientifically simplified English that
gets by with a few hundred expressions without the encumbrance of
outdated grammar; and as a result this modified version of standard
English began to be called Salamander English. In the exemplary
&Atilde;&permil;coles Zimmermann the newts expressed themselves in
the language of Corneille; not, of course, for any chauvinistic
reason but because that is simply part of any good education; at the
reform schools, on the other hand, Esperanto was learned so that it
would serve as a lingua franca. There were five or six other new
Universal Languages which emerged around this time with the intention
of replacing the Babylonian confusion of human languages with a
single, common mother-tongue for the whole world of newts and men;
needless to say that there were countless disputes about which of
these international languages is the most useful, most euphonious and
the most universal. The final result, of course, was that there was
a different universal language propagated in every nation. <a href=
"#note16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>All this became simpler when the education of newts was
nationalised: the newts in every state were to be brought up in the
appropriate local language. Although the salamanders found it
relatively easy to learn foreign languages and were keen to do so
there were found to be some peculiar difficulties, partly to do with
adapting their speech organs to human language and partly to do with
mainly psychological reasons; they had difficulty, for instance, in
pronouncing long words with many syllables and would try to reduce
them to a single syllable which they would bark out in a rather nasal
voice; they would say L instead of R and lisp on their sibilants;
they would leave off grammatical endings, they never did learn to
distinguish between 'I' and 'we' and the question of whether a noun
was masculine or feminine was matter of complete indifference for
them (this may have been manifestation of their indifference to sex
outside the breeding season). In short, every language they learned
took on new and characteristic forms in their mouths, reorganising it
into something simpler and more rudimentary. It is worth nothing
that their neologisms, pronounciations and simplified grammar was
quickly adopted by both the simplest people in the ports and by the
so-called best people; and from the ports this way of speaking spread
out into the newspapers and was soon in general use. Even many
humans stopped attending to grammatical gender, word endings were
dropped, declinations disappeared; our golden youth neglected to say
r properly and learned to lisp; few educated people were any longer
certain what was meant by 'indeterminism' or 'transcendent', simply
because these words, even for human beings, were too long and too
hard to pronounce.</p>

<p>In short, for good or for ill, the newts became able to speak
almost every language of the world according to what coast they lived
on. About this time, some of the Czech national newspapers began to
complain bitterly, no doubt with good reason, that none of the newts
could speak their language. If there were salamanders who could
speak Portuguese, Dutch and the languages of other small nations why
were there none that could speak Czech? It was true, they conceded
in regretful and learned terms, that Czechoslovakia had no sea
coasts, and that means there will be no marine newts here, but that
does not mean that Czechs should not play the same part in the
culture of the world as many of the other nations whose language was
being taught to thousands of newts, or perhaps even a greater part.
It was only right and proper that the newts should also have some
knowledge of Czech culture; but how were they to be informed about it
if none of them knew the Czech language? It was not likely that
someone somewhere in the world would acknowledge this cultural debt
and found a chair in Czech and Czechoslovak literature at one of the
newt universities. As the poet puts it, 'Trust no-one in the whole
wide world, we have no friends out there'. And so one of the
newspaper articles declared that Czechs themselves would have to do
something to rectify the matter. Whatever we've done in the world,
it asserted, we've done by our own efforts! We have a duty and the
right to try to recruit friends even among newts; but it seems that
the foreign ministry does not have much interest in spreading the
good name of our country and our products among newts, even though
other, smaller nations devote millions to opening their cultural
treasures to them as well as generating interest in their industrial
products.--This article attracted a great deal of interest from
the confederation of industry, and one result was that a brief
handbook of Czech for newts was published, complete with
illustrations of Czechoslovak handwriting styles. It may seem hard
to believe, but this little book was remarkably successful and sold
more than seven hundred copies. <a href=
"#note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Matters of education and language were, of course, only one aspect
of the great newt problem which grew up, as it were, under people's
feet. The question quickly arose, for instance, of how people were
to behave towards the newts in, so to speak, the social sphere. At
first, in the almost prehistoric period of the Newt Age, there were,
of course, societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals which
passionately ensured that the newts were not treated in ways that
were cruel or inhumane; and it was thanks to their continuous efforts
that government offices almost everywhere saw to it that the
regulations set out by police and veterinary inspectors for the
conditions of other livestock applied also to newts. Opponents of
vivisection signed many protests and petitions calling for a ban on
scientific experiments on live newts; and many countries did indeed
pass laws to that effect. <a href="#note18"><sup>18</sup></a> But as
the newts became more educated it became less clear whether newts
should simply be included under animal protection legislation; for
some reason, not entirely clear, it seemed rather inappropriate. And
so the Salamander Protection League was founded under the patronage
of the Duchess of Huddersfield. This league, numbering more than two
hundred members, mostly in England, achieved many effective and
praiseworthy improvements for the newts; in particular, they
succeeded in establishing special newt playgrounds on the coast
where, undisturbed by inquisitive human eyes, their meetings and
sporting celebrations took place (by which they probably meant their
secret dances once a month); they ensured that all places of
education (even including the University of Oxford) persuaded their
students not to throw stones at newts; to some extent they ensured
that young tadpoles at school weren't over-burdened with work; and
they even saw to it that places where newts lived or worked were
surrounded by a high wooden fence that would protect them from
various intrusions and, most importantly, would form an adequate
barrier between the world of men and the world of newts. <a href=
"#note19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>However it was not long before these commendable private
initiatives, intended to establish a fair and humane relationship
between human society and that of newts, were found not to be
enough. It was relatively easy to include salamanders into
industrial processes, but it was much harder and more complicated to
include them in any way into the existing precepts of society.
People who were more conservative asserted that there was no question
to be solved, there were no legal or social problems; the newts, they
said, were simply the property of their employers and the employers
were responsible for them and any damage they might cause; despite
their undoubted intelligence the salamanders were legally no more
than property, an object or an estate, and any legal measure
concerning the newts would, they said, be a violation of the holy
rights of private property. In response, others objected that as the
newts were a kind of intelligent being and to a large extent
responsible for their actions they might freely find various ways of
violating existing laws. How could a newt owner be expected to bear
the responsibility for any offences committed by his salamanders? A
risk of that sort would certainly destroy any private initiative
where the employment of newts was concerned. There are no fences in
the sea, they said, newts cannot be closed in and kept under
supervision. For this reason, it would be necessary to pass laws
directed at the newts themselves; in this way they would respect the
human legal order and conduct themselves in accordance with the
regulations laid down for them. <a href=
"#note20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>As far as is known, the first laws governing salamanders were
passed in France. The first paragraph set out the newts' obligations
in the event of mobilisation for war; the second (known as the Lex
Deval) instructed the newts that they were allowed to settle only on
those parts of the coast indicated by their owners or an appropriate
office of local government; the third stipulated that newts were
required, under any circumstances, to obey any order given them by a
member of the police; any failure to obey a police order would
entitle police authorities to punish them by means of incarceration
in a place that was dry and brightly lit, or even to deny them the
right to work for long periods of time. The left-wing parties
responded by putting a motion to parliament that a legal social
system for newts should be worked out. These social measures would
limit the amount of work required from them and place certain
obligations on anyone employing newts (eg. fourteen days leave at
mating time in the spring); the extreme left objected that the newts
should be designated as enemies of the working class because they
work too hard in the service of capitalism, work for almost nothing,
and thus they endanger the working man's standard of living; this
demand was followed up with a strike by harbour workers in Brest and
large demonstrations in Paris; many people were injured and Deval was
forced to resign his job as minister. In Italy the salamanders were
placed under the authority of a special Newt Corporation made up of
employers and public officials, in Holland they were governed by the
ministry supervising coastal constructions, in short every state
solved the newt problem in its own different way; but most of the
public decisions governing public responsibility, and largely
limiting the animal freedom enjoyed by the newts, were roughly the
same anywhere you looked.</p>

<p>It should be understood that as soon as the first laws for newts
were passed there were people who, in the name of jurisdicial logic,
reasoned that if human society places certain obligations on the
salamanders it would have to grant them certain rights. Any state
that lays down laws for newts acknowledges, ipso facto, that they are
beings capable of acting freely and responsibly, as legal subjects,
or even as members of the state in which case their status as
citizens would need to be adjusted in whatever legislation they lived
under. It would, of course, have been possible to designate the
newts as foreign immigrants; but in that case the state would be
unable to exact certain services and duties from them in the event of
mobilisation for war, which every country in the civilised world did
do (with the exception of England). In the event of armed conflict
we would certainly want the newts to protect our shorelines; but in
that case we could not deny them certain civil rights such as the
right to vote, the right of assembly, the right to participate in
various public offices and so on. <a href="#note21"><sup>21</sup></a>
It was even suggested that the newts had a kind of independent state
of their own under the water; but these considerations and others
like them remained purely academic; they never resulted in any
practical solution, mainly because the newts themselves never asked
for any civil rights from anyone.</p>

<p>There was another lively debate about the newts which took place
without their direct interest or participation, and that was around
the question of whether they could be baptised. The Catholic church
took a firm stand from the start and said they certainly could not;
as the newts were not the descendants of Adam they were not affected
by Original Sin, the sacrament of baptism could not be used to
cleanse them of it. The Holy Church had no wish to decide the
question as to whether the newts had an immortal soul or any other
share of God's love and salvation; their good wishes towards the
newts could only be shown by a special prayer for them, to be read on
certain days at the same time as prayers for souls in Purgatory and
intercessions for unbelievers. <a href="#note22"><sup>22</sup></a>
For the Protestant church it was not so simple; they acknowledged
that the newts had reason and could therefore understand Christian
teaching, but they hesitated to make them members of the church and
therefore brothers in Christ. So they restricted themselves to
issuing an abridged form of the Holy Gospel for Newts on waterproof
paper and distributed many million copies of it; they also considered
whether they should work out some kind of Basic Christian for them, a
rudimentary and simplified version of Christianity analogous to Basic
English; but all attempts in this direction created so many
theological disputes that in the end they had to give up on the idea.
<a href="#note23"><sup>23</sup></a> Some of the religious sects,
especially those from America, had fewer scruples in the matter; they
sent their missionaries out to the newts to teach them the True Faith
and baptised them according to the words of Scripture: Go out into
the world and teach all nations. But very few missionaries succeeded
in getting past the wooden fences that divided the newts from people;
employers would not let them have access to the newts because their
preaching might keep them away from work. So every so often you
would see a preacher standing beside a tarred fence, zealously
propounding the word of God, while the dogs fiercely barked at their
enemy from the other side.</p>

<p>As far as is known, monism was spread quite widely among the
newts, with some of the newts believing in materialism and some of
them in the gold standard or some other scientific doctrine. One
popular philosopher called Georg Sequenz even compiled a special set
of religious teachings for the newts centred around a belief in
something called the Great Salamander. This system of faith met with
no success whatsoever among the newts but found many converts among
human beings, especially in the major cities where almost overnight a
large number of secret temples for the salamander cult appeared. <a
href="#note24"><sup>24</sup></a> Most of the newts themselves,
somewhat later on, adopted a different faith, although it is not
known how they came to it; this was the worship of Moloch, whom they
imagined as an enormous newt with a human head; it was said they had
gigantic metal idols of this god under the water which they had had
made by Armstrong or Krupp. However, no more details about this cult
or its rituals were ever learned--despite their reputation for
exceptional cruelty and secrecy--because they took place under
water. It seems that this faith spread among them because the name
'Moloch' reminded them of the Latin and German words for newts
('Molche').</p>

<p>It is clear from the preceding paragraphs that the Newt Question
started out, and for a long time remained, centred around whether and
to what extent the newts had reason and whether, as clearly civilised
beings, they would be capable of making use of certain human rights,
even though only on the edge of the ordered society in which human
beings lived; in other words it was an internal question for
individual states and it was settled in the context of citizen's
rights. It was many years before it occurred to anyone that the Newt
Question could have wide ranging international importance, or that it
might become necessary to deal with the salamanders not only as
intelligent beings but also as a newt collective or nation of newts.
In truth, it should be said that the first step towards this
conception of the Newt Problem was taken by some of the more
eccentric Christian sects who tried to baptise the newts as
instructed by Holy Scripture: Go out into the entire world and teach
every nation. In this way it was made explicit that the newts were a
sort of nation. <a href="#note25"><sup>25</sup></a> But the first
international and significant acknowledgement of the newts as a
nation was in the famous speech given at the Communist
Internationals, signed by Comrade Molokov and addressed to "all the
repressed and revolutionary newts throughout the world". <a href=
"#note26"><sup>26</sup></a> This call seems to have had no direct
effect on the newts themselves, but it was widely discussed in the
press around the world and had great influence, at least, in that a
rain of fervent invitations from every side began to fall on the
newts, exhorting them, as the nation of greater newtdom, they should
align themselves with this or that idealist, political or social
program of human society. <a href="#note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Now the International Bureau of Employment in Geneva began to
concern itself with the Newt Problem. Here there were two views in
opposition to each other; one side acknowledged the newts as a new
working class and strove to have all social legislation extended to
them, regulating length of working day, paid holidays, insurance for
invalidity and old age and so on; the other view, in contrast,
declared that the newts were a growing danger as competition for
human manpower and working newts were anti-social and should simply
be banned. Not only employers' representatives objected to this idea
but also delegates from the working people, pointing out that the
newts were not just a new army of workers but also a major and
growing market. As has been said, in recent times the numbers
employed in metal working (working tools, equipment, metal idols for
the newts), weapon manufacture, chemical industry (underwater
explosives), paper industry (schoolbooks for the newts), cement
manufacture, forestry, artificial foodstuffs (Salamander food) and
many other areas had all risen at a rate unprecedented in peace time;
there was a rise of 27% in shipping tonnage compared with the period
before the newts, coal production increased by 18.6%. The rise in
employment and prosperity for people indirectly caused a rise in
turnover in other branches of industry too. Most recently, the newts
had been ordering more engineering parts according to their own
designs, using them to assemble pneumatic drills, hammers, underwater
motors, printing machinery, underwater radio equipment and other
machinery, all to their own plans and all done underwater. These
machine parts were paid for by higher productivity; by now a fifth of
all world production in heavy industry and in fine mechanics were
dependent on orders from the newts. If you put an end to the newts
you can put an end to one factory in five; instead of modern
prosperity there would be millions unemployed. The International
Bureau of Employment could not, of course, simply ignore this
objection, and in the end, and after long discussion, it arrived at
this compromise solution, that "the above named group of employees, S
(amphibians), may be employed only on water or underwater, and on the
shore only as far as ten meters above the high water line; they may
not extract coal or oil from beneath the seabed; they may not produce
paper, textiles, or artificial leather made from seaweed to be
marketed on land" and so on; these restrictions on newt manufacturing
were set out in nineteen legal paragraphs which we will not cite in
more detail, mainly because, needless to say, nobody paid them any
attention; but as a magnanimous and truly international solution to
the Newt Problem in the fields of commerce and society it was held up
as a useful and imposing achievement.</p>

<p>In other respects, international recognition of the newts was
somewhat slower, especially where cultural contact was concerned.
When the much quoted article, "The Geological Structure of the Seabed
around the Islands of the Bahamas", was published in the specialist
press and the name 'John Seaman' given as the author, then of course
nobody realised that this was the scientific work of an educated
salamander; but when newt-researchers appeared at scientific
congresses or addressed various academic or learned societies to
report on their studies in oceanography, geography, hydrobiology,
higher mathematics or other precise sciences in it caused much
consternation and indignation, expressed by the great Dr. Martel in
the following words: "Do these vermin think they've got something to
teach us?" The learned Dr. Onoshita from Japan, who dared to quite
from a report by a newt (something to do with the development of the
yoke sac of the fry of the deep sea fish, Argyropelecus Hemigymnus
Cocco), he was ostracised by the scientific community and committed
harakiri; it was a matter of honour and professional pride among
university scientists that they don't take into account any of the
scientific work done by a newt. This increased the attention (if not
outrage) given to the Centre Universitaire de Nice when it invited
Dr. Charles Mercier, a highly learned newt from the harbour at
Toulon, to give a celebratory lecture on the theme of conic sections
in non-Euclidean geometry which was met with remarkable success. <a
href="#note28"><sup>28</sup></a> Those attending the event included
a delegate from Geneva, Mme. Maria Dimineanu; this outstanding and
generous lady was so impressed by Dr. Mercier's modesty and erudition
("Pauvre petit," she is said to have sighed, "il est tellement
laid!") that she made it a part of her tirelessly active life to have
the newts accepted as a member of the United Nations. Politicians
tried in vain to explain to this eloquent and energetic lady that the
salamanders could not be a member of the United Nations because they
were not a sovereign state and did not have any territory. Mme.
Dimineanu began to propagate the idea that the newts should have
their own free territory somewhere on the planet and their own
underwater state. This idea was of course rather unwelcome if not
directly dangerous; eventually a happy solution was found in that the
United Nations would set up a special Commission for the Study of the
Newt Question, which was to include two delegates from the newt
world; the first to be called on, under pressure from Mme. Dimineanu,
was Dr. Charles Mercier of Toulon, and the second was a certain Don
Mario, a fat and learned newt from Cuba carrying out scientific work
in the field of plankton and neritic pelagial. In this way the newts
reached the highest ever international acknowledgement of their
existence. <a href="#note29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>So we see the salamanders achieving a steep and continuous rise.
Their population is now estimated at seven thousand million, although
with increasing civilisation their fertility shows a marked decline
(to twenty or thirty tadpoles per female per year). They have
occupied more than sixty percent of the world's coastlines; coasts
around the polar regions are still not habitable, but newts from
Canada have begun to colonise the coast of Greenland, even succeeding
in pushing the Eskimos back inland and taking the fishing industry
and the trade in fish oils into their own hands. The upsurge in
their material well-being went hand in hand with their progress in
civilisation; they join the ranks of educated nations with compulsory
schooling and can boast of many hundred of their own underwater
newspapers distributed in millions of copies, scientific institutions
whose buildings were an example to all, and so on. It should be
understood that this cultural ascent was not always smooth and
without internal disagreements; we know remarkably little about the
internal affairs of the newts, but there are some indications (such
as newts found dead with cuts to their noses and heads) that, under
the ocean, there was a long, protracted and passionate dispute under
the ocean between the young newts and the old. The young newts seem
clearly to have been in favour of progress without exception or
reserve, and declared that even under the water they should pursue
all the educations known on the dry land with all their efforts, even
including football, flirting, fascism and sexual perversions; whereas
the old newts, it seemed, were more conservative to the nature of
newtdom, were unwilling to give up the good old animal habits and
instincts; they left no doubt about their condemnation of the young
newts' lust for novelty and saw therein a decline and a betrayal of
traditional newt ideals; they were certainly also opposed to the
foreign influences so blindly followed by the corrupted youth of
today, and they asked whether it was worthy of the dignity of proud
and self-conscious newts to ape everything done by humans. <a href=
"#note30"><sup>30</sup></a> We can imagine that slogans such as 'Back
to the Miocene!', 'Down with all Humanising Influences!', 'Fight for
the Right for Newts to be Undisturbed!' and so on were coined.
Without a doubt, there were all the preconditions for a lively
generational conflict of views, and for a profound revolution in the
newts' spiritual development; unfortunately, we are not able to give
any more precise details, but we hope that the newts made what they
could out of this conflict.</p>

<p>So now we see the newts on the way to their greatest flowering;
but the world of human beings, too, was enjoying unprecedented
prosperity. New continents were planned out with great enthusiasm,
shallow waters were converted to dry land, and artificial islands for
aeroplanes appeared in the middle of the oceans; but compared with
the enormous technical projects which would entirely reconstruct the
globe these were as nothing, and the projects awaited nothing but
someone to finance them. The newts worked tirelessly in all the seas
and on the edge of all the continents for as long as the night
lasted; they seemed contented and asked for nothing for themselves
but something to do and a piece of coastline where they could drill
their holes and build the paths to their dark homes. They had their
cities under the water and under the land, their subterranean
metropoles, their Essens and their Birminghams twenty to fifty meters
down at the bottom of the sea; they have their overcrowded industrial
zones, ports, transport lines and cities of a million inhabitants; in
short, they had their more or less <a href=
"#note31"><sup>31</sup></a> unknown but, it seems, highly technically
developed world. Although they did not have their own kilns and
foundries they were given metals by human beings in exchange for
work. They did not have their own explosives but they bought them
from human beings. Their fuel for transport was the sea with its
tides and its currents, with its undertows and differences in
temperature; they had to obtain their turbines from human beings but
they were well able to make use of them; and what is civilisation if
not the ability to make use of things invented by others? Even if
the newts, let us say, had no thoughts of their own they were well
able to have their own science. They had no music or literature but
got by perfectly well without them; and people began to see that
thanks to the newts everything was fantastically modern.  People
could even learn something from the newts--and no wonder: were the
newts not amazingly successful and what should people take their
example from if not from success? Never in the history of mankind
had so much been manufactured, constructed and earned as in this
great age. With the newts came enormous progress and the ideal known
as Quantity. The phrase, "We people of the Newt Age", became widely
used, and used with justified pride; where could we have got in the
old-fashioned Human Age with the slow, petty and useless fiddling
known as culture, art, pure science or suchlike. The self aware
people of the Newt Age declared that they would no longer waste their
time delving into the Questions of the Universe; they would have
enough to do just with the quantity of things being manufactured.
the whole future of the world would consist in constantly raising
production and consumption; and for that there would need to be still
more newts so that they could produce even more and consume even
more. The newts were a simply a matter of quantity; they had
achieved their epoch-making changes because there were so many of
them. Only now could man's ingenuity work at full effectiveness,
because it was working on a huge scale with extremely high
manufacturing capacity and a record financial turnover; in short,
this was a great age. And what was now still missing for universal
prosperity and contentment to make this a true Happy New Age? What
was preventing the creation of the Utopia we all longed for, where
all these technical triumphs and magnificent possibilities would be
harvested, where human happiness would combine with newts' industry
to open new horizons further and further to beyond what anyone could
imagine?</p>

<p>Actually, there was nothing to prevent it; as now trade with the
newts would be crowned with the wisdom of the world's most competent
administrators, who would also ensure in advance that the machinery
of the New Age would run smoothly. In London a conference took
place, attended by seafaring nations, where the International
Convention on Salamanders was worked out and approved. The high
officials who signed the convention agreed to bind themselves not to
send their newts into the sovereign waters of other states; not to
allow their newts, in any way, to violate the territorial integrity
or acknowledged sphere of interest of any other state; that they
would not, in any way, interfere in matters affecting the newts
belonging to any other seafaring power; that any dispute between its
salamanders and those of another state would be settled by the Court
of Arbitration at The Hague; that newts would not be armed with any
weapons of a calibre exceeding that which is normal for underwater
shark guns; that they would not allow their newts to establish close
contact with the salamanders of other sovereign states; that they
would not assist their newts in the construction of new land or
extending their territory without previous permission from the
Standing Marine Commission in Geneva, and so on. (There were
thirty-seven paragraphs in all) On the other hand, the British
suggestion that marine powers should bind themselves not to oblige
their newts to carry out any military exercises was rejected; the
French suggestion that the salamanders should be internationalised
and subjected to the authority of an international newt commission
for regulating world waters was rejected; the German suggestion that
every newt should have the symbol of the state to which it belonged
branded into its skin was rejected; another German suggestion that
every marine state be allowed only a certain number of newts so that
the numbers in each state would be in proportion to each other was
rejected; the Italian suggestion that states with an excess of
salamanders be allocated new shores or areas of the sea bed for
colonisation was rejected; the Japanese suggestion that they be given
an international mandate to govern the newts as representatives of
the coloured races (the newts were by nature black) was rejected. <a
href="#note32"><sup>32</sup></a> Most of these suggestions were
deferred for the next conference of marine powers which, for various
reasons, did not take place.</p>

<p>"By this international action," wrote Monsieur Jules Sauerstoff in
'Le Temps', "the future of the newts is assured, along with peaceful
development for people for many decades to come. We congratulate the
London conference for its successful conclusions on some difficult
questions; and we also congratulate the newts that by this statute
they come under the protection of the court at The Hague; they will
henceforth be able to devote themselves to their work and their
underwater progress with a sense of peace and trust. It should be
emphasised that the removal of the Newt Problem from the field of
politics, which is what the London conference has achieved, is one of
the most important assurances we have of world peace; the disarming
of the salamanders, in particular, will do a great deal to reduce the
likelihood of underwater conflicts between individual states. The
fact is that--even though many border disputes and power struggles
continue between states on almost every continent--there is no
current threat to world peace, at least not from the direction of the
sea. But on dry land, too, we seem to have a better assurance of
peace than ever before; the seafaring nations are fully occupied with
the construction of new shores and will be able to increase their
territory by reclaiming land from the sea instead of trying to extend
their frontiers on dry land. There will no longer be any need to
fight with iron and gas for every tiny piece of land; all that is
needed will be the picks and shovels wielded by the newts for every
state to build as much territory as it needs; and it is the London
Convention which ensures that the peaceful labour of the newts will
bring peace and prosperity for all the nations of the world. The
world has never before been so close to a lasting peace and a quiet
but glorious efflorescence than now. Instead of the Newt Problem
about which so much has been written and said, we will now have good
reason to talk of The Golden Age of the Newt'."</p>

<p>NEWT MARKET</p>

<p>(Czechoslovak Press Agency) Reports issued by the Salamander
Syndicate for the end of the quarter show a thirty percent rise in
newt trading. Nearly seventy million newts were supplied over this
period, especially to south and central America, Indochina and
Italian Somalia. Plans are in progress for deepening and widening
the Panama Canal, dredging Guayaquil harbour and the deepening of
shallow waters in the Torres Straits, which, according to the latest
estimates will involve moving nine thousand million cubic metres of
firm land. Construction of islands for major airports between
Madeira and Bermuda is not due to start until next spring. Creation
of the Marian Islands, under Japanese authority, is still in
progress; eight hundred and forty acres of new land--light land as
it is called--has been created so far between the islands of Tinian
and Saipan. Newt prices are very strong, due the increasing demand,
at Leading 61 and Team 620. Supplies are adequate.]</blockquote>

these trades that the import of working newts into Australia should
come under strict control in accordance with immigration laws. In
contrast, Australian farmers have been agitating to have restrictions
on the import of newts eased because demand for domestically grown
maize and animal fats, especially sheep fat, has substantially
increased in order to feed them. The government wants to have a
compromise; the Newt Syndicate offers to make a payment of six
shillings to the trades unions for each newt imported and the
government is willing to guarantee that the newts will be employed
only in the water, which, for reasons of public decency, they will
remain immersed in up to the chest. The trade unions, though, insist
the newts show no more than their heads and ask for a payment of ten
shillings per newt in accordance with registration taxes. It seems
most likely that an agreement will be reached that involves

<p>36 DROWNING PEOPLE SAVED BY NEWTS</p>

<p>(From our own correspondent)</p>

<p>Madras, 3rd April</p>

<p>The steamer, Indian Star, collided with a boat carrying around 40
natives in Madras harbour, putting them all in danger of drowning.
Before a police boat could be sent out, a number of newts working on
the removal of mud from the dock area rushed to their assistance and
carried thirty-six drowning people back to dry land. One of the
salamanders was seen personally to pull three women and two children
from the water. As a reward for their noble actions the local
authorities wrote them a letter of thanks which was presented to them
in a waterproof case. On the other hand, many of the local residents
were appalled at the newts having been allowed to touch drowning
people who belonged to a higher caste. This was because the newts
are regarded as unclean and therefore as untouchable. Several
thousand natives gathered at the dockside insisting that the newts be
removed from the harbour area. Police however succeeded in
maintaining order; there were three deaths and one hundred and twenty
arrests.</p>

<p>Peace was restored by ten o'clock in the evening and the
salamanders have returned to work.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note9">[<b>9.</b> Cf. the following extensive and objective
description, signed as e.w., 5th October:<br><br>

<p>S-TRADE</p>

<p>"Singapore, 4th October. Leading 63. Heavy 317. Team 648. Odd
Jobs 26.35. Trash 0.08. Spawn 80--132."</p>

<p>Readers can find reports of this sort every day in the financial
sections of the papers between reports on the price of cotton, tin or
wheat.</p>

<p>But do you know what is meant by these mysterious words and
figures? Yes, they refer to the trade in salamanders, or S-Trade;
but most readers idea of what these figures actually mean is less
precise. Perhaps they imagine a big market place swarming with
thousands and thousands of newts, where buyers come in their sun
helmets and turbans, inspect the goods on offer and finally point to
a healthy, well developed, young newt saying, "I'd like to buy this
piece, what is its cost?"</p>

<p>In reality, the newt market looks somewhat different. In the
marble-clad S-Trade building in Singapore you will not see a single
newt, only lively and elegant officials in white suits taking
telephone orders. "Yes sir. Leading cost 63. How many? Two
hundred? That will be alright. Twenty Heavy and a hundred and
eighty Team. Okay, that's quite clear. The ship sets sail in five
weeks time. Right? Thank you, sir." The whole of the S-Trade
palace is abuzz with telephone calls; it seems more like an office or
a bank than a market; but this white and grand-looking building with
the Ionian columns at the front is a market place more famous than
the Harun ar Rashid bazaar in Baghdad.</p>

<p>But let us return to the market report mentioned above with all
its commercial jargon. Leading means simply the specially selected,
most intelligent newts, usually about three years old and carefully
trained to become supervisors and managers in the newts work
colonies. They are sold individually and without regard to their
body weight; they are valued solely for their intelligence.
Singapore Leading, all of whom speak good English, are considered
best of all and the most reliable; there are also various other kinds
of newts given positions of responsibility, such as the Capitanos,
Engineers, Malayan Chiefs, Foremanders and so on, but it is the
Leading Newts that are thought the most valuable. Their present
value is about sixty dollars.</p>

<p>The Heavies are muscular newts, usually about two years old and
weighing between a hundred and a hundred and twenty pounds. They are
sold only in squads known as bodies, consisting of six individuals
each. They have been trained to perform the heaviest physical work
such as rock breaking, removing boulders and so on. If a report
states that Heavies are at 317, that means that the cost if each body
is $317. Each squad of Heavies is usually assigned to one Leading
which will act as supervisor.</p>

<p>Team are the ordinary working newts, weighing between 80 and 100
pounds each; they are sold only in working groups (teams) of twenty;
they are intended for use together on major tasks and are often used
for dredging, construction of dykes and dams and so on. Each team of
twenty will have a Leading to supervise it.</p>

<p>The Odd Jobs constitute a class of their own. These are newts
that, for one reason or another, were never trained for collective or
specialised work. This could be because they grew up outside the
large specialist newt farms run by specialists. They are, in fact,
half wild, but can often be very talented. They can be bought
individually or by the dozen and can be used for various kinds of
supplementary or minor jobs for which a whole squad of newts would
not be needed. If the Leadings can be seen as the &Atilde;&copy;lite
of the newt world, the Odd Jobs can be seen as something like the
proletariat. Recently, they have commonly been bought as the raw
material for newts which can be trained further into Leading, Heavy,
Team or Trash.</p>

<p>The Trash are the less valuable newts which are weak or physically
defective. They are not sold as individuals or in squads but in bulk
by weight, typically several dozen tons at a time; the price of a
kilogram of live weight is currently between seven and ten cents. It
is not actually known what they are used for or why they are bought--
maybe they are put to some kind of light work in water; to avoid
misunderstanding, you should remember that newts are not edible for
man. They are bought almost exclusively by Chinese middle-men; where
they take them has never been ascertained.</p>

<p>Spawn consists of tadpoles up the age of twelve months. They are
bought and sold by hundreds and enjoy a lively trade, mainly because
they are cheap to buy and cheap to transport; they grow into adult
newts, capable of work, at the place where they are to be employed.
The Spawn are transported in barrels, as although adult newts need to
leave the water every day the tadpoles never do. It is not unusual
for individuals of exceptional talent to emerge from among the Spawn,
even more capable than the typical Leading; this adds a peculiar
interest to dealing in tadpoles. These highly talented newts can
then be sold for several hundred dollars each; the American
millionaire, Denicker, paid as much as two thousand dollars for a
newt that spoke nine languages fluently and had it transported on a
special ship all the way to Miami; the transport alone cost nearly
twenty thousand dollars. It has recently become popular to buy
tadpoles for the newt stables, where fast sporting newts are selected
and trained; they are then harnessed in groups of three onto flat
boats in the form of a shell. These shell races of boats pulled by
newts are now the height of fashion and the favourite pastime of
young American girls in Palm Beach, Honolulu and Cuba; they are known
as Triton Races or Venus Regattas. The young women competing will
stand in the light shell-shaped boat and scud across the water
dressed in the shortest and most alluring swimsuits, controlling the
team of three newts through silken reins; the prize is merely the
title, Venus. Mr. J.S Tincker, known as the tin-can king, bought a
trio of racing newts for his little daughter, Poseidon, Hengist and
King Edward, for at least thirty-six thousand dollars. But all this
is not part of the S-Trade proper, which limits itself to the
provision, round the world, of reliable, working Leadings, Heavies
and Teams.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the newt farms. The reader ought not to
imagine fields and enormous breeding pens; the farms consist of no
more than a few miles of bare coastline with a few scatted huts of
corrugated iron. One hut is for the vet, one for the manager, and
the others are for the supervising personnel. It is only when the
tide goes out that it is possible to see the long fences running out
into the sea and dividing the beach into a number of basins. One is
for the tadpoles, the second for the Leading class, and so on; each
class is fed and exercised separately but always at night. At
sunset, the newts come out of their holes in the shore and gather
around their teachers, who are ordinary old soldiers. First comes
the talking lesson; the teacher will say a word such as dig out loud
to the newts, and mime its meaning. Then they form into ranks of
four and they are taught to march; this is followed by a half hour of
physical exercises and a period of rest in the water. After the
break, they are how to handle various tools and weapons and then,
under the supervision of their teachers, they do practical work on
underwater constructions for about three hours. After this work they
go back into the water where they are fed on dried food for newts,
consisting mainly of corn flour and fat; Leadings and Heavies are
also given meat. Laziness and disobedience are punished by
withholding food, there are no other physical punishments, mainly
because salamanders have virtually no sense of pain. As soon as
the Sun rises on the newt farms there is a deathly silence; the
humans go to bed and the newts disappear under the sea.</p>

<p>There are only two times in the year when this procedure is not
followed. Once in the mating season when the newts are left to their
own devices for two weeks, and secondly when the tanker from the Newt
Syndicate steams into the farm with orders to the farmer about how
many newts of what classes are to be taken away. This takes place at
night; the ships captain, the farm manager and a vet sit at a table
under the lamplight while the supervisors and ships ratings close off
the newts access to the sea. Then the newts come one at a time to
the table to be judged whether they are suitable or not. The newts
chosen are put into the dinghy and taken on board the tanker.
Mostly, they are quite willing to collaborate in this affair, with
little more ever needed than a sharp word of command; there are rare
occasions when mild force is needed in form of handcuffs. The
tadpoles, of course, are caught in nets.</p>

<p>Once on board the newt tankers, the salamanders are transported
under conditions just as humane and hygienic; they receive highly
nutritious food and the water in their tanks is changed every day.
The death rate on the voyage hardly reaches ten percent.  At the
request of animal protection societies, every newt tanker has a
chaplain on board who watches over how the crew behave towards the
newts and is required to preach to them every night that they should
always show respect for humans, always do as they are told and always
feel love for their prospective employers, who would never show
anything but fatherly concern for their well-being. Fatherly concern
must certainly be a difficult concept to explain to newts, as
fatherhood is something unknown to them. The better educated
salamanders adopted the name Papa Newt for the ships chaplains. The
newts were also shown educational films during the voyage which
displayed not only the wonders of human technology but also what work
and duties would be expected of the newts. These films were found to
be very effective.</p>

<p>There are those who say that S-Trade stands for Slave Trade.
Well, as disinterested observers we can say that if the former slave
trade had been as well organised and hygienic and as perfectly
operated as the current trade in newts, then we could only offer the
slaves our congratulations.  The more expensive salamanders in
particular are treated very well, if only because the captain and
crew of the newt tankers are depend on the lives of the newts
entrusted to them for their own wages. The author of this article
has seen personally how the toughest of seamen on tanker SS 14 were
deeply touched when two hundred and forty top class newts in one of
the tanks became ill and suffered serious diarrhoea. They went to
see them almost with tears in their eyes and gave expression to their
humane feelings with the rough words, "These bastards owe us too much
to die on us now!"]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note10">[<b>10.</b> We cite the following contemporary
description:<br><br>

<p>BUCCANEERS OF THE XX CENTURY E.E.K.</p>

<p>It was eleven at night when the captain ordered the national flag
to be taken down and put out the dinghy. It was a bright, moonlit
night; I think it was Gardner Island we rowed out to, in the Phoenix
Archipelago. On moonlit nights like that the newts come out onto the
shore and dance; you can go up close to them and they won't hear you,
they're so obsessed with this dance of theirs, all there together and
saying nothing. There were twenty of us who went onshore carrying
oars, we spread out all around the swarm of newts on the beach and
surrounded them in the darkness, apart from the milky light of the
moon.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe what it feels like to see those newts
dancing. About three hundred of them sit on their back legs in a
perfect circle, facing inwards; the middle of the circle is empty.
The newts keep perfectly still as if they'd gone rigid; it looks like
a circular palisade around some secret altar; only there's no altar
there and no god. All of a sudden one of them starts hissing
"ts-ts-ts" and swinging the upper half of its body round and round;
then the next one starts doing the same and so on and on and after a
few seconds all the newts are whirling the upper half of their bodies
round like a frenzy, but staying on the same spot, quicker and
quicker, not saying a word but getting faster and faster, like they
were drunk or possessed. After about a quarter of an hour one of the
newts will start to get tired, then another, then a third, they'll
lose their strength as they swing round and then go stiff; then they
all sit still again like statues, then after a while another one of
them will start going "ts-ts-ts", another one will start swinging
round and then they're all suddenly dancing again, the whole circle.
I know the way I'm describing it makes it sound very mechanical, but
imagine it with the moonlight making everything white and the waves
on the shore make their long slow sounds; there was something made it
seem infinitely magical, and something made it seem evil. I stood
there, hardly breathing, I wasn't sure whether I was amazed or
horrified. "Here, you'd better move your feet, mate," called the man
nearest to me, "else you'll start growing roots!"</p>

<p>We closed in around the circle of animals as they danced. The men
held their oars out in front of them and whispered, not so much
because the newts might hear them as that it was night. "Into the
middle, quick," called out the commanding officer. We all ran into
that circle of newts as they whirled about, and you could hear the
oars as they thudded down on the newts backs. It was only then that
the newts were startled and cowered down into the centre or tried to
slide away into the sea between the oars, but those ones got hit with
an oar that threw them back into the circle and they'd scream with
the pain of it, and because they were so scared. Wed use a flagpole
to push them back into the middle, squeeze them into a tight group,
all lying on top of each other; ten men would round them up into a
pen made of oars and another ten would use their oars to hit and
shove the ones that tried to climb out under them and run away. It
was just one mass of black, writhing meat, panicked and screaming as
the oar blows landed on them in the darkness. Then they'd open up a
gap between two of the oars; a newt would creep out of it and it'd be
knocked down with a blow on the back of the head with a big stick;
then there'd be another one and a third one until there were about
twenty of them lying there. "Close it," the officer ordered, and the
gap between the two oars would shut. Bully Beach and Dingo, the
half-cast, they'd take one of the stunned newts in each hand and drag
them along the beach to the dinghy, just like sacks, not like living
beings. If the newt that was being dragged along got caught between
some stones the seaman dragging him would just pull harder and give a
vicious tug so that a leg might be pulled off. "Don't you worry
about that," grumbled old Mike who was standing next to me. "It'll
grow back again." Once all the stunned newts had been thrown into
the dinghy, the officer would just say, "Get the next lot ready."
And then it would start all over again, with the newts being clubbed
on the back of the head. This officer, Bellamy, his name was, he was
a quiet and educated man, an excellent chess player; but this was a
hunt, or rather a business just like any other. There were more then
two hundred newts knocked out like this; about seventy of them were
left because they were probably dead an not worth the effort of
dragging away.</p>

<p>Back on board, the captured newts were thrown into a tank. Our
ship was an old oil tanker and the tanks stank of oil because they
hadn't been cleaned out properly, and the water had an obvious oily
film over it. All that had been done was that the cover had been
taken off so that the air could get to it. When the newts were
thrown in it looked thick and repulsive, like some kind of noodle
soup. In some places where they moved about they looked weak and
pitiful. Over the next day they were left alone while they came to,
then the day after, four men would come along and jab long poles into
the soup, as everyone called it, they'd mix all the bodies together
and watch to see if there were any that weren't moving or where the
flesh was falling off; they'd hook them on long poles and pull them
out of the tank. Then the captain would ask Is the soup clean?--Yes
sir.--Pour the water in--yes sir. That soup had to be cleaned like
this every day, and each time they'd throw six to ten pieces of
damaged goods, as they called them, into the sea; there was always a
lot of big and well fed sharks closely following our ship. The stink
from the tanks was awful; despite being changed now and then the
water in them was yellow, full of excrement and bits of wet food;
there'd be these black bodies lying about in it, splashing wearily or
just doing nothing, hardly able to breathe. Well they've got it
good, old Mike insisted. I saw a ship once used to transport them in
metal benzine barrels; they all died.</p>

<p>Six days later we picked up new goods off the island of
Nanomea.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>This then, is how the trade in newts is operated; an illegal
business, modern piracy to be more exact, which burgeoned overnight,
as it were. It is said that nearly a quarter of all the newts bought
and sold have been hunted and captured in this way. Newts multiplied
in the hatcheries which the Newt Syndicate no longer wished to
maintain as farms and overran some of the smaller islands in the
Pacific so much that they became a serious pest; the local people
disliked them and insisted they put entire islands in danger of
collapse because of the tunnels and passageways; so the colonial
authorities and the Newt Syndicate itself turned a blind eye to the
pirate raids where the newts lived. It was reckoned that there were
as many as four hundred pirate ships occupied solely with hunting
newts. As well as the small traders there were entire shipping
companies acting as latter day buccaneers in this way, and the
biggest of them was the Pacific Trade Company, based in Dublin with
Charles B. Harriman as its managing director.  A year earlier it had
been even worse, with Teng, a bandit from China, would use his three
ships to directly attack the farms of the syndicate itself and had no
hesitation in killing the staff if they tried to stand in their way.
The previous November, Teng and the whole of his fleet had been sunk
by the American gunboat, Minnetonka, off Midway Island. Since then,
the trade in newts had kept to less wild forms of piracy and enjoyed
steady growth after certain procedures had been agreed on such as the
ships national flag being hoisted when it attacks the shore of a
foreign land, that no other goods would be traded in under the
pretext of piracy, that the newts acquired would not be disposed of
at dumping prices but would be designated inferior quality when put
on the market. Newts in the illegal trade would be sold at between
twenty and twenty-two dollars each; they are seen as inferior quality
but very robust considering that they survived the terrible treatment
on the pirate ships. It was estimated that, on average, twenty-five
to thirty percent of newts captured went through this experience; and
that they would be capable of going through more. In the trade
jargon they were known as Maccaroni, and recently had begun to be
listed in regular business reports.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Two months later I was playing chess with Mr. Bellamy in the
lounge of the Hotel France in Saigon; I wasn't contracted to a ship
at that time, of course.</p>

<p>"Bellamy," I said to him, "you're a decent person, a gentleman,
you might say. Doesn't it ever feel strange for you that you're
doing something that, basically, is the lowest kind of slave
trade?"</p>

<p>Bellamy shrugged his shoulders. "Newts are newts," he grumbled
evasively.</p>

<p>"Two hundred years ago they said niggers are niggers."</p>

<p>"And weren't they right?" said Bellamy. "Check!"</p>

<p>I lost that game. It suddenly occurred to me that every move on
the chessboard is old and has been played by somebody at some time.
Maybe our own history has been played out by somebody at some time,
and we just move our pieces about in the same moves to strike in the
same way as people have always done. Maybe it was the same sort of
quiet and decent Bellamy that used to hunt negroes on the Ivory Coast
and transported them to Ha&Auml;ti and Louisiana, letting them die on
the lower decks. That Bellamy, back in those days thought nothing of
it. This Bellamy never thinks anything of it. That's why he's
incorrigible.</p>

<p>"Black loses," declared Bellamy cheerfully, and got up to go for a
walk.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note11">[<b>11.</b> We cite a report on the scientific congress in
Paris by an eye-witness, r.d.<br><br>

<p>Ier CONGR<span style=''>&Atilde;&circ;</span><span style=''>S
D'UROD</span><span style=''>&Atilde;&circ;</span><span style=
''>LES</span></p>

<p>Known in short as the amphibians congress, the official title of
the congress was somewhat longer: The First International Congress of
Zoologists for Psychological Research into Caudate Amphibians. No
true Parisian, though, likes long names such as this, so they
referred to the learned professors who sat in the halls of the
Sorbonne simply as Messieurs les Urod<span style=''>&Auml;les, the
newt men. Or else, even shorter and less respectful, those zoo
men. </span></p>

<p>So we went to have a look at those zoo
men, not so much out of journalistic duty as out of simple
curiosity. The curiosity, you understand, was not so much for the
mostly aged and bespectacled scientists but for the...creatures
(why do we feel difficulty in writing the word animal?) about whom so
much has already been written both in scientific papers and in the
popular press. There are some who say that what has been written is
no more than journalistic humbug, but others say that these animals
are in may respects more gifted than the Lord of the World and Crown
of Creation himself, as man is still called--even after the World
War and other incidents. I hoped that the venerable gentlemen taking
part in the congress for research into the minds of caudate
amphibians would provide a clear and final answer for us laymen as to
Andrias Scheuchzer's fabled intelligence, that they would say to us
yes, this is an intelligent being, or at least tell us that they are
as capable of civilisation as you or I. For this reason, we should
consider what the future might hold for these creatures just as we
should consider what the future might hold for mankind, a race once
thought so wild and primitive. I tell you there was no answer given,
nor any question of this sort put to the congress; modern science has
become too...specialised to concern itself with problems of this
sort.</p>

<p>So let us try to learn something about
what a scientist would call animal psychology. That tall gentleman
with the long beard now mounting the podium, that is the famous
Professor Dubosque; he seems to be criticising some perverse theory
by some esteemed colleague, but it is difficult for us to follow this
side of his argument. Indeed, it is only after considerable time
that we realise that this man speaking with the enthusiasm of a black
magician is discussing the ability of Andrias to perceive colours and
his ability to distinguish various shades. I cannot be sure that I
understood properly, but I left with the impression that Andrias
Scheuchzeri might be largely colour-blind, but that Professor
Dubosque must be terribly short sighted going by the way he lifted
his papers up to his thick, glasses that sparkled wildly in the
light. Professor Dubosque was succeeded on the podium by the smiling
Dr. Okagawa from Japan; he explained something about reaction times
and other effects that result if he cut some kind sensory channel in
Andrias's brain; then he told us how Andrias responds if part of the
auditory system is crushed. Professor Rehmann, coming next,
explained in detail how Andrias responds to electric shocks, at which
a passionate dispute arose between him and Professor Bruckner. C'est
un type, this Professor Bruckner: small, angry, and lively to an
extent that verges on the tragic; amongst other things, he asserted
that the sense organs of Andrias are as weak as those of man and that
he has the same limited instincts; looked at from a purely biological
point of view, Andrias is an animal as degenerate as man, and just
like man he tries to make up for these biological deficiencies by
what is known as intellect. However, the other specialists seem not
to have taken Professor Bruckner seriously, probably because he had
not severed any sensory nerves and had not shot any electric charges
into any newts brain. He was followed by Professor van Dieten who
slowly and almost reverentially described the disorders that are seen
in Andrias after the right temporal lobe of the brain has been
removed or the occipital lobe from the left hand side. Then there
was a reading from Professor Devrient from America...</p>

<p>Forgive me, I am not quite sure what it
was that Professor Devrient said in his reading as at that moment my
head had begun to spin at the thought of what disorders would be seen
in Professor Devrient if his right temporal lobe were removed; how
the smiling Dr. Okagawa would respond if he were given electric
stimulants and how professor Rehmann might behave if his auditory
cavities were crushed. I also began to feel rather uncertain about
my abilities to distinguish colours and my sensory-motor reactions.
I started to be tortured with doubt as to whether (speaking strictly
scientifically) we have any right to talk of our own (mankind's)
spiritual life considering that we have not butchered each others
cerebral lobes and cut sensory nerves. Should we turn on each other,
scalpel in hand, to study each others spiritual life? As far as I am
concerned I would be quite happy--in the interests of science--to
smash professor Dubosque's glasses or shoot electric shocks into
Professor Dieten's bald head and publish an article about how he
reacts. In fact I can imagine how he would react quite vividly,
although I find it harder to imagine what goes on in the would of
Andrias Scheuchzer in experiments of this sort even though I know
already that he is a boundlessly patient and good-natured creature as
none of the lecturing professors mentioned any time that poor Andrias
Scheuchzeri ever became angry. I am in no doubt that the First
Congress on Caudate Amphibians has been a remarkable scientific
success; but as soon as I have a day free I will be going to the
Jardin des Plantes and straight to the tank where Andrias Scheuchzeri
is held so that I can quietly say to him, "You, newt, your day will
come one day...but please never think of examining the spiritual
life of people!"]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note12">[<b>12.</b> The uses to which newts can be put was researched
in particular by Wuhrmann in Hamburg, and this is just one short
extract from his papers on the subject:<br><br>

<p>BERICHT &Atilde;&oelig;BER DIE SOMATISCHE VERANLAGUNG DER
MOLCHE</p>

<p>In the experiments carried out by myself on the great Pacific newt
(Andrias Scheuchzeri Tschudi) in my laboratory in Hamburg, I was
directed by one certain objective: to examine the newts ability to
withstand changes to their environment and other external influences
and thus to show how they can be put to practical use in various
parts of the world and under varying conditions. </p>

<p>The first of the experiments was intended to ascertain how long
the newt can survive away from water. The subjects were kept in a
dry tank at a temperature of 40 to 50 degrees Celsius. After some
hours they showed distinct signs of tiredness, but became more active
if sprayed with water. After a period of twenty-four hours they lay
motionless, moving nothing more than their eyelids; the pulse slowed,
and all physical activities were reduced to a minimum. The animals
were clearly suffering and the slightest movement cost them a great
deal of effort. After three days they entered a state of cataleptic
stillness (xerosis); they did not respond even if burned with an
electric cauterisor. If the humidity of the air was raised, then
they began to show certain signs of life (blinking if exposed to
strong sources of light etc.) If a newt was thus dehydrated for
seven days and then thrown into water it would it would take
considerable time before it once again became active; but a large
number of subjects deprived of water for a longer period perished.
If left in direct sunshine they would die after only a few
hours. </p>

<p>In another experiment, subjects were forced to turn a crank handle
in the dark and in a very dry environment. After a period of three
hours their activity began to decline but became rose again after
spraying with copious amounts of water. If the spraying was
frequently repeated the animals continued to turn the crank for up to
seventeen, twenty or, in one case, even twenty-seven hours, whereas a
human subject acting as control was already quite exhausted after
only five hours of this mechanical activity. From these experiments
we can conclude that newts are well suited to work on dry land
provided that two obvious conditions are observed; they cannot be
exposed to direct sunlight and they need to be sprayed with water
from time to time. </p>

<p>The second series of experiments was intended to test the
resistance of these originally tropical animals to cold. If cooled
suddenly with water, the subjects would die from intestinal catarrh;
however, if allowed slowly to acclimatise to a cold environment, the
subjects would become used to it and after a period of eight months
they even remained active in water at a temperature of 7&Acirc;&deg;
C, provided they were given extra fat in their diets (150 to 200
grams each). If the water temperature was reduced to below
5&Acirc;&deg; C the subjects would become stiff (gelosis); in this
state they could be frozen and kept in a block of ice for several
months; when the ice was melted and the water temperature rose above
5&Acirc;&deg; C they would begin, once again, to show signs of life
and at seven to ten degrees they would become lively and seek food.
It can be seen from this that there is no difficulty in acclimatising
newts even to our own climate as far as northern Norway and Iceland.
For polar conditions, further experiments would be needed. </p>

<p>In contrast with this, the subjects showed themselves remarkably
sensitive to chemicals; in experiments using very dilute lye,
discharge from factories, tanning fluids etc., the skin fell off
their bodies in broad strips and the subjects died from some kind of
inflammation of the gills. This means that, for the conditions found
in our rivers, newts are practically unusable. </p>

<p>In another series of experiments, we were able to ascertain how
long a newt is able to survive without food. They can be kept hungry
for three weeks or even longer, showing no symptoms worse than a
certain lethargy. I kept one of the newts hungry for a period of six
months; after the first three months it slept continuously and
without any kind of movement; when the newt was then thrown into a
tub of chopped liver it was so weak that it showed no reaction and
had to be fed by hand. After some days it began to eat normally and
the newt concerned could be put to use in further experiments. </p>

<p>The final series of experiments examined the newts ability to
recover from injury. If a subjects tail was cut off it would regrow
within fourteen days; this was attempted with one newt no less than
seven times, each time with the same result. the same result was
observed if the subjects feet were cut off. All four limbs and the
tail were amputated from one subject; and within thirty days it was
once again whole. If the thigh or shoulder bone of one of the
animals is broken, the entire limb will fall off and a new one will
be grown to replace it. The same result was obtained if a subjects
eye or tongue was cut out; although one interesting observation was
that the newt whose tongue had been removed lost the ability to speak
and had to learn it all over again. If a newts head is amputated, or
its body bisected anywhere between the neck and the pelvis, the
animal dies. On the other hand, the stomach can be removed, part of
the intestine, two thirds of the liver or other organs, without any
disturbance to the animals life functions, so that we can say a newt
that has been all but disembowelled is still capable of life. There
is no other animal so resistant to any sort of injury than the true
newt. This capacity would make of it a first-class, almost
indestructible, animal for use in warfare if it were not for its
peaceable nature and natural failure to defend itself. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Alongside these experiments, my assistant, Herr Doktor Walter
Hinkel, examined the newts to ascertain whether they could be a
source of useful raw materials. We were interested in particular to
ascertain whether the body of a newt contains a large quantity of
iodine or phosphorus; and our positive results suggest it might be
possible to extract these important elements on an industrial scale.
The skin of a newt in its natural state does not have any serious
use, it can however be ground to a paste and subjected to high
pressure to create an artificial leather which is light and strong
enough to offer a serious alternative to leather from the hides of
cattle. Because of its repulsive odour, the fat in a newt's body is
of limited use, but its very low freezing temperature makes it of
possible value as a lubricant for machinery. The meat of a newt was
likewise considered unusable, and even as poisonous; if consumed in
its raw state it causes serious pains, vomiting and sensory
hallucinations. After a large number of experiments conducted on
himself, however, Dr. Hinkel was able to ascertain that these harmful
effects disappear if slices of the meat are steamed (in this way it
resembles certain mushrooms), thoroughly rinsed, and soaked for
twenty-four hours in a weak solution of hypermanganese. It can then
be boiled or steamed and tastes like poor quality beef. In this way
we consumed the newt whom we had come to know as Hans; Hans was an
educated and intelligent animal with a special talent for scientific
work; it had worked in Dr. Hinkel's department as a laboratory
assistant and could even be trusted with delicate chemical analyses.
We would spend entire evenings talking with Hans who enjoyed
boundless curiosity. It became unfortunately necessary to dispose of
Hans after he became blind after my experiments with trepanation.
Hans's meat was dark and with a slight flavour of mushrooms, but left
no unpleasant effects. There is no doubt that in the event of need
arising from war it would be possible to use newt meat as a cheap
substitute for beef.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note15">[<b>15.</b> Viz <em>Mme. Louise Zimmermann, sa vie, ses
id&Atilde;&copy;es, son eouvre</em> (Alcan). We quote from this work
the admiring memory of a newt who was one of her first pupils:<br><br>

<p>"Sitting beside our simple but clean and comfortable tank, Mme.
Zimmermann would read the legends of Lafontaine to us. The dampness
was unpleasant for her, but she paid no attention as she was so
engrossed in her task as our teacher. She called us mes petis
chinois because, just like the Chinese, we were unable to pronounce
the letter r, but after some time she became so used to it that she
began to pronounce her own name as Mme. Zimmelmann. We tadpoles
adored her; the little ones who still had not developed lungs and
therefore were not able to leave the water, cried when they could no
accompany her on her walks around the school garden. She was so
loving and gentle that, as far as I know, there was only one occasion
when she became cross; that was on one very hot day when the young
lady who taught us history put on a bathing costume and got into the
tank with us and told us about the struggle for independence in the
Netherlands sitting up to her neck in water. Then our dear Mme.
Zimmermann became truly angry: "Get out of there immediately
Mademoiselle," she shouted with tears in her eyes, "get out and wash
yourself, get out, get out". For us newts it was a clear but gentle
lesson that we do not belong among people. Later on were grateful to
our spiritual mother that she had made us conscious of this in such
an emphatic and tactful way.</p>

<p>"When we had studied hard, she would read
us some modern poetry, such as Fran&Atilde;&sect;ois
Copp&Atilde;&copy;a, as a reward. It is really rather too modern,
she would say, but, after all, even that is part of a good education
nowadays. At the end of the school year there was an open day to
which the prefect of Nice and other important persons in government
and other fields of excellence were invited. The most gifted and
advanced pupils who already had their lungs were dried off by the
caretaker and dressed in white; and then, behind a thin curtain so
that they would not alarm the ladies, they would read out the fables
of Lafontaine, mathematical formulae and the history of the Capet
dynasty with all the important dates. Then the prefect would give a
long and beautiful speech of thanks to our dear headmistress that
brought the day to an end. As much care was given to our physical
development as to our spiritual development; once a month we were
inspected by the local vet and every six months each of us was
weighed. Our dear mentor laid especial emphasis on the need to give
up the disgusting and base habit of dancing to the moon; but I am
sorry to say that some of the older students did commit this bestial
disgrace in secret when the moon was full. I hope our friend and, as
it were, mother never learned about this; it would have broken her
great, noble and loving heart."]</blockquote>


<blockquote id="note16">[<b>16.</b> Amongst others, the famous linguist, Curtius, in
the publication, <em>Janua Linguarum aperta,</em> suggested that the
only general language to be adopted by newts should be the Latin of
the golden age of Vergil. It is today within our grasp, he declared,
for Latin, this most perfect of languages, the richest in grammatical
rules and most developed in science, to once more be a living
language in use in all parts of the world. If those educated parts
of mankind do not take this opportunity then you, salamandrae, gens
maritima, you should grasp it yourselves; choose for your home
language eruditam linguam Latinam, the only language worthy of being
spoken throughout orbis terrarum. Salamandrae, should you resurrect
the eternal language of gods and heroes into new life then it will be
a service that lasts forever; for, gens Tritonum, with this language
we would be accepting the legacy of Rome that was the ruler of the
world.<br><br>

<p>In contrast with Curtius, a certain
telegraph clerk in Lithuania by the name of Wolteras, working in
collaboration with Pastor Mendelius, invented and developed a
language specially for newts which he called puntic language; in it,
he used elements from all the languages of the world, especially
African languages. This newt language, as it became known, became
quite popular, especially in the countries of the north, although,
unfortunately, only among humans; in Uppsala there was even a chair
in newt language founded but among the newts themselves there is no
record of it being spoken by a single one. The truth is that the
most popular language among the newts was Basic English, which later
became the newts official language.]</blockquote>

Seidel-Novom&Auml;&rsaquo;stsk&Atilde;&frac12;, preserved in Mr.
Povondra's collection of cuttings.<br><br>

<p>OUR FRIEND IN THE GAL&Atilde;PAGOS</p>

<p>After the painful loss of our dear aunt, the author Mrs. Bohumila
Jandov&Atilde;&iexcl;-St&Aring;&trade;e&Aring;&iexcl;ovick&Atilde;&iexcl;,
my wife, the poetess Jind&Aring;&trade;icha
Seidlov&Atilde;&iexcl;-Chrudimsk&Atilde;&iexcl;, and I undertook a
journey around the world so that the charm of so many new and
powerful impressions might go at least some way to assuage our
sorrow. We arrived on the Gal&Atilde;&iexcl;pagos Islands, so lonely
and so swathed in legend, where we were spending two or three hours
of free time in a promenade along the beach.</p>

<p>"See how beautiful the sunset is today,
my dear," I said to my spouse. "Is it not as if the whole of the sky
were drowning in a sea of blood and gold?"</p>

<p>"Do I have the pleasure of speaking to a
Czech gentleman?" I heard a voice say in pure and correct Czech, not
far behind us.</p>

<p>In surprise, we looked around us in that
direction but there was no-one to be seen, only a large black newt
sitting on a rock and holding in its hand something that looked like
a book. In the course of our travels around the world we had already
come across a large number of newts but had not had the opportunity
of engaging with any of them in conversation. So, dear reader, you
can understand our astonishment when, on an abandoned shore such as
where we found ourselves, we came across a newt that addressed us in
our own language.</p>

<p>"Who is that speaking?" I asked, in
Czech.</p>

<p>"It was I who took that liberty, sir,"
the newt replied very politely as it stood up. "I'm afraid it was
the first time in my life that I heard Czech being spoken and I was
unable to resist."</p>

<p>"But how come," I asked in astonishment,
"you speak Czech?"</p>

<p>"Well I was just occupied with studying
the conjugations of the irregular verb, to be," the newt replied, "as
this is a verb that is irregular in all languages of the
world."</p>

<p>I pursued my question. "How where and
why have you learned Czech?"</p>

<p>"It was by mere good fortune that this
book came into my hands," the newt answered as it handed the
aforementioned book to me; the book was Czech for Newts, and its
pages bore the marks of frequent and diligent use. "It arrived on
these shores as part of a consignment of books of an educational
nature. I found myself offered the choice of <em>Geometry for the
Sixth Form</em>, The <em>History of Military Strategy</em>, a guide
to the Dolomites and <em>The Principles of Bimetalism</em>. This is
the book I chose, and it has since become my second favourite. I
already have its contents by heart, although it is still able to be a
continual source of entertainment and education for me."</p>

<p>My lady wife and I expressed our
unfeigned joy and wonderment at this news and the newt's near perfect
pronunciation. "It is however unfortunate," the newt continued
modestly, "that there is no-one here with whom I am able to speak
Czech, and I am even uncertain as to whether the word for 'horse' in
the instrumental case is 'koni' or 'ko&Aring;&circ;mi'."</p>

<p>"It is 'ko&Aring;&circ;mi'," I informed
the newt.</p>

<p>"But no, it is 'koni'," objected my lady
wife.</p>

<p>"Would you be so kind as to tell me of
the latest events in Prague, the mother of cities with its hundred
towers?" asked our dear companion with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"The city is growing, my friend," I
explained, pleased at his interest, and briefly adumbrated the recent
efflorescence of our golden metropolis.</p>

<p>"This does indeed portend well for the
future," replied the newt with unfeigned pleasure. "And are the
heads of the Czech aristocrats still to be seen impaled around the
towers?"</p>

<p>"That was a long time ago," I told him,
somewhat (I confess) surprised by his question.</p>

<p>"That is indeed a pity," opined this
likeable newt. "It was a historic monument of great value. We can
be thankful to the Lord God that took so many remarkable historic
monuments in the Thirty Years War! If I am not mistaken, the Czech
lands were at that time transformed into a desert, stained with blood
and tears. We can also be grateful that the negative genitive did
not perish at that time. This book explains that it is currently
disappearing, and I will be indeed sorry if that is indeed
so."</p>

<p>"So you take an interest in our history,"
I exclaimed with joy.</p>

<p>"I do indeed," the newt replied.
"Especially the subjugation that followed the Battle of White Hill
and the Thirty Years War. I have read a great deal on the matter in
this book. I'm sure you must be very proud of your three centuries
of subjugation. It was a great era for the Czech people."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a difficult time," I said,
thinking to humour him. "A time of oppression and
sorrow."</p>

<p>"And did you suffer greatly?" asked our
friend with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"We suffered unspeakable and unrelenting
sorrows under the yoke of the oppressor."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it," the newt said
with relief. "That's just what it says in the book. I'm glad to
hear that it is true. It is an excellent book, sir, far better than
<em>Geometry for the Sixth Form</em>. I would be very glad to stand
on the memorable spot where the Czech aristocracy were executed, as
well as on the other celebrated places of cruel
wrongdoing."</p>

<p>"You must look in on us when you are
there," I invited sincerely.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your kind invitation,"
said the newt with a bow. "I am, however, unfortunately not at
liberty to travel as far as..."</p>

<p>"We could buy you," I declared. "That is
to say, the national collection might be willing to procure the means
to...</p>

<p>"Hearty thanks," mumbled our friend,
clearly touched. "But I have heard that the water of the Vltava is
not good. You see, in river water we suffer severe diarrhoea." Then
he considered the matter a little and added, "and I would also be
sorry to abandon my dear little garden."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed my lady wife, "I am also
very fond of gardening! I should be very grateful if you would show
us something of the local flora!"</p>

<p>"With the greatest of pleasure, dear
lady," said the newt, bowing most politely. "If, that is, it is of
no concern to you that my garden is under water."</p>

<p>"Under water?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, two hundred metres under
water."</p>

<p>"But how is it possible to cultivate
flowers two hundred metres under water?"</p>

<p>"Sea anemones," our friend informed us,
"including some very rare species. There are also starfish and sea
cucumbers, not to mention the bushes of coral. To cultivate one rose
is to cultivate one's homeland, as the poet tells us."</p>

<p>It was necessary for us to make our
departure, for the ship had already given its signal. "And what
message do you have, Mr...." I asked, uncertain as to the name of
our dear companion.</p>

<p>"My name is Boleslav
Jablonsk&Atilde;&frac12;," the newt told us shyly. "I consider it to
be a very beautiful name, sir. I chose it myself from this
book."</p>

<p>"And what message do you have, Mr.
Jablonsk&Atilde;&frac12;, for us to convey back to our
people?"</p>

<p>The newt considered the matter for a
short while. "You may tell your compatriots," he said slowly, deeply
moved, "tell them...that they should always maintain the ancient
disagreements among the Slavonic peoples...that they should always
retain Lipany and the defeat at White Hill in their grateful memory.
Farewell,..." he ended suddenly, attempting to overcome his
feelings.</p>

<p>As we departed in the dinghy back to the
ship, full of thoughts and tender feelings, our friend stood on the
rocks and waved to us, and as he did so he seemed to call something
out to us.</p>

<p>"What was that, he cried?" asked my lady
wife.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I answered, "but it
sounded something like, 'give my greetings to the mayor, Dr.
Bax'."]</blockquote>

strictly forbidden, albeit, of course, only for Jewish
researchers.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note19">[<b>19.</b> This seems also to have affected certain ethical
movements. Among the articles in Mr. Povondra's collection was a
declaration published in newspapers all around the world, translated
into many different languages and even signed by the Duchess of
Huddersfield. It read:<br><br>

<p>"Women of the world, in the interests of decency and morality the
League for the Protection of Newts calls on you to contribute your
handiwork to our campaign to provide newts with suitable clothing.
The most suitable garment would be a skirt 40 cm. long, 60 cm. at the
waist and preferably fitted with elastic. The skirt should be
pleated to enable better ease of movement for the wearer. For
tropical areas, a mere apron will be adequate, fitted with the means
to fasten it at the waist, which could be made from very simple
working materials such as some of your own discarded clothing. In
this way you will remove the need for the unfortunate newts to work
in public and in the presence of human beings without any sort of
decent covering, which they cannot do otherwise than feel as an
insult to their dignity and which could only be a cause of unease for
any decent person, especially women and mothers."</p>

<p>There is no indication anywhere that this call met with any
success; it is not known whether any newts ever chose to wear a skirt
or an apron; it would probably have got in their way underwater and
been difficult to keep up. And wherever the newts were separated
from human beings behind a wooden fence there would have been, of
course, no reason for either humans or newts to feel any shame or
emotional discomfort.</p>

<p>The idea that the newts needed to be protected from harassment of
various sorts was mainly because of dogs, which never were able to
get used to them and would chase the newts in a barking frenzy, even
under water and despite the fact that if they ever bit a newt it
would leave a caustic slime in their mouths. There were even times
when the newts would defend themselves and more than one doughty
hound was killed with a pickaxe or crowbar. Between dogs and newts
there developed a permanent, deadly enmity which was intensified,
rather than weakened, when a physical barrier was put between them.
But that is often the case, and not only between dogs. These fences,
coated with tar and stretching often along hundreds and hundreds of
kilometres of coastline, were also used to teach the newts proper
behaviour, and along the whole length of them they were painted with
large letters urging the, for instance:</p>

<p>Your work--Your success</p>

<p>Value every second!</p>

<p>The day has only 86,400 seconds!</p>

<p>You're only worth as much as you work</p>

<p>A meter of dam can be built in 57 minutes!</p>

<p>The worker serves us all</p>

<p>Who will not work, let him not eat!</p>

<p>And so on. Considering that these wooden fences stretched along
more than three hundred thousand kilometres of coastline around the
world, you can imagine how many encouraging slogans would fit onto
them and how much they were of benefit to everyone.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note20">[<b>20.</b> The first trial of a newt, that took place in
Durban, was of great interest to the press all round the world (viz
Mr. Povondra's collection of cuttings). The port authority in A.
employed a working colony of newts. In the course of time they
multiplied so much that the port soon did not have enough room for
them all; some tadpoles began to establish new colonies out on the
surrounding coastline. Part of this coastline was on the property of
farmer B. and he asked the port authority to remove the newts from
his private beach because he liked to bathe there. The port
authority refused, saying the matter was nothing to do with them as
the newts, having settled on his land, had become his private
property. While these protracted negotiations continued, the newts,
partly from instinct and partly because of the eagerness for work
that had been inculcated in them, began, without the appropriate
orders or permission, to construct a dyke and a dock on Mr. B.'s
stretch of beach. At this, Mr. B. made a complaint with the
appropriate office to for damage to his property. At first the
complaint was rejected on the grounds that Mr. B.'s land, far from
being damaged, had been enhanced by the newts' activities, but this
decision was overturned and verdict was passed in favour of the
complainant on the grounds that no-one should have to tolerate a
neighbour's domesticated animals on his land. The port authority in
A. was held responsible for all the damage caused by the newts just
as a farmer would be held responsible for damage caused to a
neighbour by his cattle. The port authority, of course, objected
that it could not be held responsible for the newts because in the
sea they could not be fenced in. The neighbour declared that in his
view the damage caused by the newts should be seen in the same way as
damage caused by chickens which likewise could not be fenced in
because they were able to fly. Counsel for the port authority asked
how his client was expected to remove the newts or force them to
leave Mr. B.'s private beach. The judge answered that that was no
concern of the court. Counsel asked whether it would be acceptable
to the honourable judge if the port authority had these undesirable
newts shot. The judge answered that as an Englishman and a gentleman
he would consider that highly inappropriate as well as a violation of
Mr. B.'s hunting rights. The port authority was therefore required
to remove the newts from the complainant's private property, to
remove the damage caused by the newts' having constructed dams and
waterworks there and to restore that stretch of beach to its original
state. Counsel for the defendant asked whether his client would be
allowed to use salamanders for this demolition work. The judge
replied that this would certainly not be allowed unless the
complainant gave his permission, which was in doubt because the
complainants' wife found the newts repellent and was unable to bathe
on a beach infested with newts. The port authority objected that
without newts it would not be possible to remove the waterworks
constructed below the waterline. At this, the judge declared that it
was no matter of the court to make decisions on technical details and
had no wish to do so; courts were there to protect private property,
not to decide what was feasible and what not.<br><br>

<p>In this way the matter was brought to its
end. It is not known how the port authority in A. got round this
difficult problem; but the whole matter goes to show that the newt
problem will need to be regulated with new judicial provisions that
address it directly.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note21">[<b>21.</b> There were some who took the matter of equal
rights for newts literally, and asked that salamanders be allowed to
establish government offices under water and on land (J. Courtaud);
or that they should form fully armed underwater regiments with their
own underwater commander (General M. S. Desfours); or even that mixed
marriages between newts and humans should be allowed (Louis Pierrot,
avocat). scientists objected that marriages of this sort would not
be possible; but Mister Pierrot declared that it was not a matter of
natural possibilities but of a legal principle and that he himself
would be willing to take a newt female for his wife in order to show
that this reform of the legal principle of marriage need not remain
merely on paper. (Later in his career, Mister Pierrot became a
highly sought after divorce lawyer.)<br><br>

<p>At this point it is worth mentioning that
the press, especially in the United States, would occasionally
publish reports of girls who had been raped by a newt while bathing.
As a result, the number of cases in America where a newt was captured
and lynched or burned alive multiplied rapidly. Scientists came
forward to protest at this folk custom, insisting that it their
anatomy made it physically impossible for any newt to commit a crime
of this sort, but their words were in vain; too many girls had sworn
that they had been assaulted by a newt and so for any regular
American the matter was clear. Later on at least, the sport of
burning a newt alive was only allowed to take place on a Saturday and
under the supervision of the fire brigade. The Society for the
Prevention of the Lynching of Newts was established under the
leadership of the Reverend Robert J. Washington and counted hundreds
of thousands of members, of whom almost all were mere negroes,
including the Reverend Washington. The American press began to
maintain that this was a political movement with the intention of
overturning the government; as a result the areas inhabited by
negroes came under attack and many of them were themselves burned
alive, especially those who prayed for Brother Newt in their
churches. The climax of indignation against negroes reached its peak
when a black church in Gordonville (L.) was burned down and the fire
spread to the whole of the city. (But this is only incidental to the
story of the newts.)</p>

<p>We can at least list a few of the
advantages that the newts really did receive; each salamander was
listed in a registry of newts with the place where he worked; it was
required to obtain an official residence permit; it had to pay income
tax which, as the newts received no wages as money, was paid by its
owner who would then deduct it from the newt's food; it was likewise
required to pay rent for the coastline where it lived, local tax and
contribute to the erection and upkeep of the wooden fences; school
taxes and other public costs; in short, we have to admit that the
newts, in this respect, were treated no differently than any other
citizen and in this way enjoy full equality.]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="note24"><b>[24.</b> The papers in Mr. Povondra's collection included
a highly pornographic brochure which, according to police reports,
had been published in B***. It is not possible to quote the contents
of this "private publication, issued in the interests of scientific

few of its details:<br><br>

<p>The temple of the salamander cult, to be found at number *** in
*** Street, has, at its centre, a large pool panelled with dark red
marble. The water in the pool is perfumed with fragrant essences,
warmed, and illuminated from below with continuously changing
coloured lights; all else in the temple is darkness. At the chant of
the newt liturgy, the entirely naked followers of the cult step into
the rainbow coloured pool down marble steps, men on one side, women
on the other. Many of its adherents belong to the highest society,
such as Baroness M., S., the film star, D., the member of parliament,
and many other outstanding personalities. Suddenly, a blue light
shines on an enormous marble block that emerges from the water and on
which there is an ancient black newt, lying at rest but breathing
heavily. This is Master Salamander. There is a period of silence,
and then Master Salamander begins to speak; he calls on the faithful
to devote themselves and with all their souls to the forthcoming
ceremonies of the salamander dance and to revere the Great
Salamander. Then he raises himself and begins to sway and vigorously
twist the upper half of his body. The male members of the faithful,
immersed up to their necks in water, begin also to twist and swing in
a frenzy that becomes faster and faster in order, so they say, to
create the sexual medium while to salamanders utter loud ts-ts-ts and
raucous croaking. Then the coloured lights under the water go out
one after another and the orgy begins.</p>

<p>We cannot be sure that this description is entirely reliable, but
it is certain that the police in al the major cities of Europe not
only spent large resources on persecuting these salamander sects but
also spent large resources on covering up the enormous scandals
associated with them. It seems that although the cult of the
salamander was very widespread its ceremonies did not always take
place in the fairy tale splendour described here and that, among the
lower classes, they took place on dry land.]</blockquote>

the podium there's a lectern, and beside it...yes folks, that
really is a tin bathtub I can see there, a perfectly ordinary tin
bathtub such as you might have in your own bathroom. Two porters
accompany the timid figure, concealed beneath his long cape, onto the
podium, and the applause from the audience seems somewhat
ill-at-ease. Dr. Charles Mercier bows shyly and looks round,
uncertain as to where he is to be seated. "Voil&Atilde;&iexcl;,
Monsieur," whispers one of the porters, pointing out the tin
bathtub. "That's for you, sir." It's obvious that Dr. Mercier feels
highly embarrassed and is uncertain how he's to turn down such
attentiveness by his hosts; he tries his best to sit down in the tub
without drawing attention to the situation but his long cape gets
caught up in his feet and fall down into the tub with a loud splash
that soaks all these gentlemen on the podium who, needless to say,
pretend that nothing at all has happened; somebody in the audience
begins to laugh hysterically, but the people in the front row look
round and admonish him with a loud 'shh!'.  Then Monsieur le Maire
et D&Atilde;&copy;put&Atilde;&copy; stands up and begins to speak.
Ladies and gentlemen, he says, it is my honor to welcome to the
beautiful city of Nice Doctor Charles Mercier, the outstanding
scientist among our near neighbors who lie in the depths of the sea.
(Dr. Mercier stands up in the water and gives the audience a deep
bow.) This is the first time in the history of civilization that
land and sea have worked hand in hand in intellectual pursuits.
Until now, there was a clear boundary that our spiritual lives were
not able to cross; that was the oceans that surround us. We were
able to sail across them, we were able to plough our way through the
waves in our boats in any direction we wanted; but, ladies and
gentlemen, it was not possible for civilization to penetrate beneath
its surface. The sea that surrounds the little pieces of land
occupied by mankind has always, until now, been something wild and
unknown; at same time as it offered us astonishing possibilities it
has always kept us away; on the one had we saw the rise of
civilization and on the other we saw nature, eternal and never
changing. The barriers created for us by the oceans, dear listeners,
are now falling away. (Applause) It is to us, the children of this
great age we live in, that comes the great fortune to be
eye-witnesses to the process of our spiritual home expanding, to see
it burst out from its own shores and enter the waves of the sea, to
conquer the depths of the sea and combine the ancient knowledge of
the oceans with the modernity of civilization. That is an inspiring
prospect! (Bravo!) Ladies and gentlemen, it is now that, for the
first time ever, the culture of the oceans has appeared and here with
us today we have its most eminent representative whom we have the
honor to welcome here among us. Our planet has become a planet that
is truly and wholly civilized. (Enthusiastic applause. Dr. Mercier,
in the bathtub, stands and bows.)</p>

<p>Monsieur le Maire and D&Atilde;&copy;put&Atilde;&copy; then turned
to Dr. Mercier, who was supporting himself on the edge of the
bathtub, deeply touched and sucking hard on his gills; My dear
doctor, as a great scientist you will be able to convey our best
wishes to your friends and compatriots on the seabed, to tell them
how we admire them and sympathise with them. We send our greetings
to those at the forefront of progress and knowledge, a forefront
which, step by step, will colonise the endless expanses of the sea
and create a new world of culture on the seabed. I can already see
the rise of a new Athens, a new Rome in the depths of the oceans, the
efflorescence of a new Paris with an underwater Louvre and an
underwater Sorbonne with an underwater Arc de Triomphe and an
underwater War Memorial, with underwater theaters and underwater
boulevards. Allow me to express one of my most secret thoughts: it
is my fondest hope that in the blue waves of the Mediterranean, just
here off the shore of our city, there will be a new Nice, a glorious
Nice that will be your Nice with her own majestic avenues under the
sea, her own meadows and promenades alongside our C&Atilde;&acute;te
d'Azur. We welcome you, and look forward to a deeper acquaintance; I
am personally convinced that closer social and scientific contacts
between us, making such an auspicious beginning here today, will lead
our nations to ever closer cultural and political co-operation in the
interests of all of mankind, world peace, prosperity and progress.
(Long applause).</p>

<p>Now, Dr. Charles Mercier stands up and
does his best to thank the mayor and representative of Nice; but he
seems to be too touched by the occasion, or else his pronounciation
is rather too strange for us to understand; all that I could catch
from what he said with such difficulty was a few words; if I am not
mistaken they were "great honor", "cultural contacts" and "Victor
Hugo". Then, clearly overwhelmed by the experience, he hid himself
back in the bathtub.</p>

<p>After this it was the turn of Paul
Mallory to speak, but what he said was not so much a speech as an
anthem, lit with the poetry of deep philosophy. I thank my fate, he
said, that I have lived to see one of mankind's most beautiful myths
fulfilled and confirmed in such a strange way. Instead of the
mythical Atlantis sinking under the waves we have the astonishing
sight of a new Atlantis emerging from the deep. Doctor Mercier, you
are a poet of geometry, you, along with your learned colleagues, are
the first ambassadors from this new world from the sea, not Aphrodite
born of the foam but Pallas Anadyomene. Strangest of all though, of
a mystery incomparable with...</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<h4>MISTER POVONDRA READS THE PAPERS AGAIN</h4>

<p>There's nothing that makes the passage of time more obvious than
seeing our children grow! Where's little Frank now, who we left (so
recently, it seems!) on the tributaries on the left bank of the
Danube?</p>

<p>"Where's our Frank got to?" grumbled Mr. Povondra as he opened his
evening paper.</p>

<p>"You know, same as always," said Mrs. Povondra, bent over her
sewing.</p>

<p>"Out chasing after girls again, is he?" said Mr. Povondra
disapprovingly. "Damn boy! Nearly thirty years old, he is, and
never spends a single evening at home!"</p>

<p>"He certainly gets through his socks fast enough," sighed Mrs.
Povondra as she drew another worn-out sock over the wooden last.
"Now what am I going to do with this one?" she said as she
contemplated a large hole on the heel that resembled the outline of
Ceylon. "Better just throw it out, I suppose," she thought
critically, but nonetheless, after further strategic considerations,
she stuck her needle decisively in at Ceylon's southern coast.</p>

<p>A dignified homely peace reigned for a while, the sort the
Povondras were so fond of; there was only the rustle of the newspaper
and the fast-moving needle and thread to answer it.</p>

<p>"Have they got him yet?" asked Mrs. Povondra.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"That murderer, the one who killed that woman."</p>

<p>"I can't be bothered with this murderer of yours," grumbled Mr.
Povondra with distinct contempt. "I've been reading here about how
tensions have erupted between China and Japan. That's a serious
matter, that is. It's always a serious matter out there."</p>

<p>"I don't think they're ever going to catch him now," Mrs. Povondra
opined.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"That murderer. They don't often catch them when they murder
women."</p>

<p>"Japan doesn't like it that China's been regulating the Yellow
River. That's politics, that is. For as long as the Yellow River
keeps playing up they'll keep on having floods and famines in China,
and that keeps China weak. Pass me the scissors, mother, I'll cut
this one out."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"'Cause it says here they've got two million newts working on the
Yellow River."</p>

<p>"That's a lot, isn't it!"</p>

<p>"I should say so. Mind you, girl, I'm sure it must be America
that's paying for it. Why would the Mikado want to put his own newts
in there--And look at this!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The Petit Parisien says here that France won't like it at all.
And I sure they won't. I wouldn't like it either."</p>

<p>"What wouldn't you like, dear?"</p>

<p>"For Italy to extend the island of Lampedusa. That's a very
important strategic position, that is. Italy would be able to
threaten Tunis from there.  And the Petit Parisien says that Italy
wants to turn the island into a first class marine fortress, that
there are sixty thousand armed newts already there--Just think of
that! Sixty thousand; that's three divisions, mother. There's
something going to happen down there in the Mediterranean if you ask
me. Have a look yourself; I'll cut it out for you."</p>

<p>In the meantime Ceylon had disappeared under the industrious
needle of Mrs. Povondra and reduced itself to no more that the
proportions of Rhodes.</p>

<p>"And there's England, too, don't forget," Mr. Povondra
considered. "They're going to have their troubles, too. In the
House of Commons they've been taking about how Great Britain will be
left behind all the other states where water constructions are
concerned. They say all the other colonial powers are building new
shorelines and reclaiming new land all the time while the British
government is too conservative and won't trust the newts. And that's
quite true, mother. Very conservative they are, the English. I knew
someone once who worked at the British embassy, and he would never
let our Czech sausage past his lips, not for the life of him. Said
they didn't eat it in England so he wouldn't eat it here. I'm not
surprised other countries are getting ahead of them." Mr. Povondra
nodded his head earnestly. "And there's France extending its
coastline out by Calais. So now there's panic on in England that the
French might start shooting at them across the Channel if the Channel
gets any narrower. That's what it comes to. There's nothing to stop
them extending their own coast off Dover and then they should shoot
at France."</p>

<p>"Why would they want to do that, dear?" asked Mrs. Povondra.</p>

<p>"You don't understand these things. These are military matters.
I wouldn't be surprised if there was some trouble there. And if not
there it'll be somewhere else. It stands to reason, mother, with all
these newts the world situation is entirely different. Entirely
different."</p>

<p>"Do you think there's going to be a war?" asked Mrs. Povondra
uneasily. "I wouldn't want our Frank to get mixed up in any
war."</p>

<p>"War?" thought Mr. Povondra. "It'd have to be a world war so that
the world powers could divide the sea between themselves. We'll stay
neutral, though. Somebody has to stay neutral so that they can
supply arms and all that to the others. That's how it works,"
concluded Mr. Povondra. "But you women don't understand these
things."</p>

<p>Mrs. Povondra pressed her lips together and, with a few quick
strokes of her needle, finished the elimination of Ceylon from young
Frank's sock. "And just think," said Mr. Povondra with hardly
suppressed pride, "this dangerous situation wouldn't have arisen if
it hadn't been for me! If I hadn't let that sea captain in to see
Mr. Bondy that time then the whole course of history would have been
different. There are other doormen who wouldn't have let him in, but
I said to myself, I'll take on that responsibility. And now look,
you've even got countries like England and France having trouble
because of it! And there's still no knowing what might happen
next." Mr. Povondra drew vigorously on his pipe. "That's how it is,
my love. The papers are full of stories about the newts. Here's
another one, look," Mr. Povondra put down his pipe, "it says here
that newts have attacked some village near the city of Kankesanturai
in Ceylon; seems the natives had been going out and killing them.
The police and a squad of the local militia were called in," read Mr.
Povondra read, "and then there was a proper shooting match between
the newts and the people. Several of the soldiers were injured..."
Mr. Povondra put down his paper. "I don't like the sound of that,
mother."</p>

<p>"Why's that, then?" asked Mrs. Povondra as she carefully and
contentedly clicked the scissors over the place where the island of
Ceylon had been. "After all, there's nothing there!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," exclaimed Mr. Povondra as he stood up
and began to pace anxiously up and down the living room. "I don't
like the sound of that at all. Newts and people shooting at each
other; you can't have that sort of thing going on."</p>

<p>"Maybe these newts were just trying to defend themselves," laughed
Mrs. Povondra as she put the socks away.</p>

<p>"Exactly," grumbled Mr. Povondra uneasily. "If these horrors
start trying to defend themselves things are going to turn bad. It's
the first time they've done that....Oh my God, I don't like the
sound of that!" Mr. Povondra stopped pacing and stood in thought.
"I don't know but...maybe I should never have let that sea captain
in to see Mr. Bondy!"</p>

<h3>BOOK THREE</h3>

<h4>THE WAR WITH THE NEWTS</h4>

<div id="chapter16" class="chapter">
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<h4>MASSACRE ON THE COCONUT ISLES</h4>

<p>In one thing, Mr. Povondra was mistaken: the shots exchanged at
Kankesanturai were not the first conflict between people and newts.
The first known skirmish had taken place some years before on the
Coconut Isles in the golden age of pirate raids on the salamanders;
but even that was not the oldest incident of this sort and in the
ports of the Pacific Ocean there was much talk about certain
regrettable cases when newts had offered any kind of resistance,
sometimes even to the normal S-Trade; although petty incidents such
as these are not written about in the history books.</p>

<p>On the Coconut Isles, or Keeling Isles, this is what happened: The
Montrose, a raiding ship operated by Harriman's Pacific Trade Company
and under the captaincy of James Lindley, sailed in for one of its
usual newt gathering expeditions of the sort known as a Macaroni
Run. The Coconut Isles were well known for a bay with a large newt
population settled there by Captain van Toch himself but which,
because of its remoteness, was left, as they say, to its own
devices. No-one could accuse Captain Lindley of any lack of care and
attention, not even in that the men who went on shore were not
armed. (At that time the trade in hunting newts had already taken on
a standard form; it is true, of course, that the pirate ships had
earlier used to equip themselves with machine guns and even light
cannons, although they were not intended for use against the newts
but against unfair competition from other pirates. One day however,
off the island of Karakelong, one of Harrimans steamers came up
against a Danish ship whose captain considered the hunting grounds of
Karakelong as his territory; so the two sides settled some old
accounts to do with their prestige and some trading disputes by
leaving the newts alone and starting to fire at each other with their
rifles and Hotchkiss guns; on land, victory went to the Danes after
their successful knife attack but the Harriman ship then had its
success by firing its cannons at the Danish ship and sinking it with
all hands, including Captain Nielsen. This became known as the
Karakelong Incident. So then governments and officials of the
relevant countries had to become involved; pirate ships were from
then on forbidden to use cannons, machine guns or hand grenades; the
companies involved also allocated what they called the free hunting
ground among themselves so that any one newt settlement would only
ever be visited by a certain raiding ship; this gentleman's agreement
among the great pirates was adhered to and respected even by the
smallest raiding businesses.) But to return to Captain Lindley, he
conducted himself entirely in accordance with commercial and marine
practices of the time when he sent his men out to gather newts armed
only with sticks and oars, and the later official enquiry gave the
dead captain full satisfaction in that respect.</p>

<p>The men who went down to the Coconut Isles that moonlit night were
under the command of Lieutenant Eddie McCarth, who was already
experienced in this sort of newt-gathering expedition. It is true
that the herd of newts they found on the shore was exceptionally
large, estimated at between six and seven hundred strong and fully
grown males, whereas Lieutenant McCarth had only sixteen men at his
command; but it cannot be said that he failed to do his duty, partly
because the officers and ratings on the pirate ships were paid, it
was said, according to how many newts they captured. In the ensuing
enquiry by the marine authorities it was found that "although
Lieutenant McCarth is responsible for this unhappy incident it is
quite clear that no-one else would have acted differently under the
circumstances". The unfortunate young officer had, in fact, shown
remarkable prudence in that instead of slowly surrounding the newts,
which, given their numbers, could not have been fully achieved, he
ordered a sudden attack with the intention of cutting the newts off
from the sea, forcing them inland and stunning them one by one with a
blow to the head with a club or an oar. Unfortunately, when the
attack took place the sailors were separated from each other and
nearly two hundred salamanders escaped into the water. While the
attacking men were processing those newts which had been prevented
from reaching the sea they began to hear shots behind themselves from
shark guns; no-one had any idea that these wild and natural newts on
the Keeling Isles were equipped with weapons against sharks and
no-one ever found out who had given them to them.</p>

<p>One of the deck hands, Michael Kelly, who had survived the whole
catastrophe, said: "When we heard the first shots we thought it must
be some other ship that had come to hunt for newts like we had.
Lieutenant McCarth turned round quick and shouted, 'What are you
doing, you fools, this is the crew of the Montrose here!' Then he
was hit in the side, but he still pulled out his revolver and started
shooting. Then he got a second shot in the neck and he fell. Then
we saw for the first time that it was the newts firing at us and
trying to cut us off from the sea. Then Long Steve raised his oar
and rushed out at the newts shouting Montrose! Montrose! so we all
started shouting Montrose! and thumping at these horrors with oars or
whatever we could. There was about five of us left lying there, but
the rest of us fought our way down to the water. Long Steve jumped
in and waded out to the boat; but when he got there some of the newts
grabbed hold of him and pulled him down under the water. They
drowned Charlie and all; he shouted to us Lads, Jesus Christ lads,
don't let them get me, but there was nothing we could do. Those
vermin were shooting us in the back; Bodkin turned round and he got
it in the belly, all he said was Oh no! and he fell. So we all tried
to get back inland to the interior of the island; wed already broken
all our oars and sticks on these monsters, so all we did was run like
rabbits. By then, there was only the four of us left. We didn't
dare go any further away from the shore in case we couldn't get back
on board ship; we hid behind some stones and bushes and had to look
on while the newts finished off our mates. Drowned them in the water
like kittens, they did, and if anyone still tried to swim they gave
him one on the head with a crowbar. It was only then I saw I had a
twisted ankle and couldn't run any further."</p>

<p>Captain James Lindley, who had remained on board the Montrose,
must have heard the gunfire from the island; whether he thought there
was some trouble with the natives or that there were some other newt
traders there, he simply took the cook and two of the stokers who had
stayed on board, had the machine gun (which was clearly hidden on the
ship despite being strictly forbidden) put on the remaining boat, and
went out to help his crewmen. He was careful not to set foot on the
shore; he merely went close in the boat with the machine gun ready on
its prow and stood there with folded arms for all to see. Let us
allow Mister Kelly to explain further.</p>

<p>"We didn't want to call out to the captain so that the newts
wouldn't find us. Mister Lindley stood in the boat with his arms
folded and called out, What's going on here? Then the newts turned
round to look at him. There was a couple of hundred of them on the
shore, and more and more of them kept swimming up from the sea and
surrounded the boat. What's going on here? the captain asked, and
then a big newt went up close to him and said, Go back! The captain
just looked at him, he didn't say anything for a while and then he
asked, Are you a newt?</p>

<p>We are newts, said this newt. Now please, go back!</p>

<p>I want to see what you've been doing with my men, said the old
man. You should not have attacked us, said the newt. You will now,
please, go back to your ship! The captain didn't say anything again
for a while, and then he calmly said,</p>

<p> Alright Jenkins, fire! And Stoker Jenkins started firing at the
newts with the machine gun."</p>

<p>(Later, at the official enquiry, the affair was described in these
words: In this respect, Captain James Lindley did no more than we are
entitled to expect from a British seaman.)</p>

<p>"All the newts were together in a group," Kelly's testimony
continued, "and so they fell like corn in a field. Some of them shot
at Mr. Lindley with those guns of theirs, but he stood there with his
arms folded and didn't even move. Just then a black newt came out of
the water just behind the boat, and it had something in its paw
something like a tin can, with its other paw it pulled something out
of it and threw it into the water under the boat. After about five
seconds there was a column of water came up and there was a loud
bang, but sort of muffled sounding, and we could feel how it made the
ground shake under our feet."</p>

<p>(From Kelly's description, the official enquiry concluded that the
newts had used an explosive known as W3, supplied to them for
removing rock from under the water at the fortification works in
Singapore, but it remained a mystery how it came into the hands of
the newts on the Coconut Isles. There were some who surmised that
the explosives were given them by people, others supposed the newts
themselves must already have had some long distance communications.
Public opinion clamoured for a ban on giving the newts such dangerous
explosives; however the appropriate office declared that there was
still no other explosive that was as "highly effective and relatively
safe" as W3, and that's how things were left.)</p>

<p>"The boat flew up into the air," Kelly's testimony continued," and
was ripped to pieces. All the newts, the ones that were still alive,
rushed up to the place. We couldn't really see whether Mr. Lindley
was dead or alive; but all three of my shipmates--Donovan, Burke and
Kennedy--jumped up and went to help him so that he wouldn't fall
into the hands of those newts. I wanted to run up as well but I had
that twisted ankle so I sat where I was and pulled on my foot with
both hands to try and get the bones in the right place. So I don't
know what happened next, but when I looked up there was Kennedy lying
there face down in the sand and there was no sign at all of Donovan
or Burke; there was just still something going on in the water."</p>

<p>Kelly then escaped deeper into the island until he found a native
village; but the natives behaved strangely towards him and were
unwilling even to offer him shelter; perhaps they were afraid of the
newts. It was only seven weeks later that the Montrose was found,
entirely plundered and abandoned, at anchor off the Coconut Isles by
a fishing boat which rescued Kelly.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, a British gunboat, HMS Fireball, sailed to the
Coconut Isles and spent the night waiting at anchor. It was once
again full moon, and the newts came out of the sea, took up their
places in a circle on the sand and began their ceremonial dance.
Then His Majesty's Ship fired its first rounds of grapeshot into
them. Those newts that weren't cut to pieces immediately stiffened
and then fled into the water; that was when the six cannons thundered
out their terrible salvo and the only newts left were the few that
still crawled towards the water on their broken limbs. Then there
was another salvo from the cannons, and then a third.</p>

<p>When that had ended, HMS Fireball withdrew to half a mile offshore
and began to fire into the water as it slowly sailed up and down the
coast. This lasted six hours and used about eight hundred rounds of
ammunition. Then the Fireball sailed away. Over the following two
days, the whole of the sea around the Keeling Isles was covered with
the dismembered remains of thousands and thousands of newts.</p>

<p>That same night a battleship from Holland, the Van Dijck, fired
three rounds into a colony of newts on the island of Goenong Api; the
Japanese cruiser Hakodate shot three grenades onto the little newt
island of Ailinglaplap; the French gunboat, Bechamel, disrupted the
newts dance on the island of Rawaiwai with three shots. This was a
warning to the newts. It was not in vain; there was no further
incident anywhere comparable with the Keeling Killing, and the trade
in newts, both organised and freelance, was able to flourish without
disturbance and with official blessing.</p>
</div>

<div id="chapter17" class="chapter">
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<h4>SKIRMISH IN NORMANDY</h4>

<p>A conflict that took place in Normandy somewhat later had a quite
different character. The newts there, most of whom worked in
Cherbourg and lived on the surrounding beaches, had become very fond
of apples. Their employers, though, were unwilling to provide them
with anything but the usual newt food (they said it would raise
construction costs above the projected budget) and so the newts began
to undertake scrumping raids in the nearby orchards. The land owners
complained about it to the prefecture and the newts were strictly
forbidden to go anywhere on the beach outside the designated newt
area, but this was of no help; the orchards continued to suffer
steady losses, eggs seemed to disappear from the chicken coops, and
every morning more and more guard dogs were found dead. So the
villagers began to guard their orchards themselves, armed with
ancient shotguns, and shot the poaching newts. It would have
remained just a local matter; but the people of Normandy were also
annoyed that their taxes had been raised and the price of ammunition
had gone up, so they developed a deadly malice towards the newts and
undertook raids against them in heavily armed gangs. When they had
shot a large number of newts even while they were at work, the newt's
employers complained to the prefecture and the prefect ordered that
the villagers should have their rusty old guns taken away. The
villagers of course resisted, and there were unpleasant conflicts
between them and the gendarmes; the stubborn Normans were no longer
just shooting at the newts but also, now, at the police.
Reinforcements were sent out to Normandy and carried out a house to
house search.</p>

<p>It was just about at this time that there was a very unpleasant
incident near Coutances: a group of local lads attacked a newt who,
they claimed, had been acting suspiciously near a hen coop. They
surrounded him with his back against the wall of a barn and began to
throw bricks at him. The injured salamander raised his hand and
threw down something that looked like an egg; there was an explosion
which ripped not only the newt to pieces but also three of the lads:
eleven year old Pierre Cajus, sixteen year old Marcel
B&Atilde;&copy;rard and fifteen year old Louis Kermadec; and there
were also five other children seriously injured to varying degrees.
The news quickly spread throughout the region; about seven hundred
people came in buses from all around and attacked the newt colony in
the bay of Basse Coutances, armed with shotguns, pitchforks and
flails. Around twenty newts were killed before the police were able
to subdue the angry crowd. Sappers called in from Cherbourg
surrounded the bay with barbed wire; but that night the salamanders
came out of the sea, destroyed the barbed wire fences with hand
grenades and tried to make their way inland. Several companies of
soldiers with machine guns were quickly brought in on lorries and a
chain of troops was used to try and keep the newts separate from
people. Meanwhile, the people were attacking the finance offices and
police stations and one unpopular tax inspector was hanged on a
lamppost with a placard saying: Away with the Newts! The newspapers,
especially those in Germany, talked about a revolution in Normandy;
although the government in Paris issued vehement denials.</p>

<p>While the bloody skirmishes between people and newts spread along
the coast of Calvados into Picardy and Pas de Calais, the ageing
French cruiser, Jules Flambeau, sailed out of Cherbourg towards the
western coast of Normandy; it was later found that the cruiser was
only intended to calm and reassure the local inhabitants and the
newts. The Jules Flambeau dropped anchor a mile and a half from the
bay of Basse Coutances; when night came, in order to create a
stronger impression, the captain order coloured rockets to be set
off. This beautiful spectacle was watched by a large number of
people on the shore; suddenly there was a hissing noise and an
enormous column of water rose at the bow of the ship; it keeled over
and there was a terrible explosion. It was clear that the cruiser
was sinking; within a quarter of an hour motor boats had come out
from the nearby ports to offer help but they were not needed; apart
from three men killed in the explosion itself the whole crew was
saved and the Jules Flambeau went down five minutes later, its
captain being the last to leave the ship with the memorable words,
"There's nothing we can do".</p>

<p>The official report, issued that same night, announced that the
"ageing cruiser, the Jules Flambeau, which was anyway to be withdrawn
from service within a few weeks from now, hit rocks while sailing by
night and, with its boiler exploding, sank", but the press were not
so easily satisfied; while the government influenced press maintained
that the ship had hit a recently laid German mine, the opposition and
foreign press carried headlines such as:</p>

<p>FRENCH CRUISER TORPEDOED by newts!</p>

<p>MYSTERIOUS EVENTS off the coast of Normandy</p>

<p>NEWTS IN REVOLT!</p>

<p>"We call to account," wrote one French member of parliament in his
paper, "those who gave arms to the newts that they could use against
people; who put bombs in their paws so that they could kill French
villagers and children as they play; who gave these monstrosities
from the sea the most modern torpedoes so that they could sink French
shipping whenever they want. Let us call them to account, I say: let
them be indicted for murder, let them be dragged before a military
tribunal for treason, let them be investigated for us to learn how
much they profited from supplying the rabble of the oceans with the
weapons to attack civilisation!" And so on; there was simply a
general consternation, people gathered on the streets and began to
build barricades; Senegalese riflemen, their guns stacked in
pyramids, were stationed on the boulevards of Paris, and waiting in
the suburbs were tanks and armoured cars. This was when the minister
for marine affairs, Monsieur Fran&Atilde;&sect;ois Ponceau, stood in
parliament, pale but decisive, and declared: The government accepts
the responsibility for having equipped newts on French territory with
guns, underwater machine guns, and torpedoes. French newts, however,
are equipped only with light, small calibre cannons; German
salamanders are armed with 32cm. underwater mortars. On French
coasts there is only one underwater arsenal of hand grenades,
torpedoes and explosives every twenty-four kilometres on average, on
Italian coasts there are deep-water depots of armaments every twenty
kilometres and in German waters every eighteen kilometres. France
cannot leave her shores unprotected and will not do so. It is not
possible for France to simply stop arming her newts. the minister
would issue instructions for the most thorough investigations
possible to discover who is guilty for the fatal misunderstanding on
the Normandy coast; it seems that the newts saw the coloured rockets
as a signal for military action and wished to defend themselves. The
captain of the Jules Flambeau and the prefect of Cherbourg were both
removed from their positions; a special commission was set up to
ascertain how businesses involved in water works treated their newts
with the expectation that that they would come under strict
supervision in future. The government deeply regretted the loss of
human lives; Pierre Cajus, Marcel B&Atilde;&copy;rard and Louis
Kermadec would be decorated as national heroes, buried at government
expense and their parents rewarded with a large sum of money.
Substantial changes were made at the highest level to the way French
shipping was managed. The government put a motion of no-confidence
in the National Assembly, to be settled when more information was
available, and the cabinet announced that it would remain in
permanent session.</p>

<p>The newspapers, according to their political colour, urged
punishment, eradication, colonisation or a crusade against the newts,
a general strike, resignation of the government, the arrest of newt
owners, the arrest of communist leaders and agitators and many other
protective measures of this sort. People began frantically to
stockpile food when rumours of the shores and ports being closed off
began to spread, and the prices of goods of every sort soared; riots
caused by rising prices broke out in the industrial cities; the stock
exchange was closed for three days. It was simply the more worrying
and dangerous than it had been at any time over the previous three or
four months. But this was when the minister for agriculture,
Monsieur Monti, stepped dexterously in. He gave orders that several
hundred loads of apples for the newts should be discharged into the
sea twice a week along the French coasts, at government cost, of
course. This measure was remarkably successful in pacifying both the
newts and the villagers in Normandy and elsewhere. But Monsieur
Monti went even further: there had long been deep and serious
disturbances in the wine-growing regions, resulting from a lack of
turnover, so he ordered that the state should provide each newt with
a half litre of white wine per day. At first the newts did not know
what to do with this wine because it caused them serious diarrhoea
and they poured it into the sea; but with a little time they clearly
became used to it, and it was noticed that from then on the newts
would show a lot more enthusiasm for sex, although with lower
fertility rates than before. In this way, problems to do with the
newts and with agriculture were solved in one stroke; fear and
tension were assuaged, and, in short, the next time there was another
government crisis, caused by the financial scandal around Madame
T&Atilde;&para;ppler, the clever and well proven Monsieur Monti
became the minister for marine affairs in the new cabinet.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<h4>INCIDENT IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL</h4>

<p>Not long afterwards, a Belgian ferry, the Oudenbourg, was steaming
its way from Ostende to Ramsgate. In the straits of Dover the duty
officer noticed that half a mile south of its usual course there was
something going on in the water. He could not be sure that there was
no-one drowning there and so he ordered a change of course down to
where the perturbance was taking place. Two hundred passengers on
the windward side of the ship were shown a very strange spectacle: in
some places a vertical jet of water shot out from the surface, and in
some of those vertical jets there could be seen something like a
black body thrown up with it; the surface of the sea for one or two
hundred yards all around was tossing and seething wildly while, from
the depths, a loud rattling and humming could be heard. "It was as
if there was a small volcano erupting under the sea." As the
Oudenbourg slowly approached the place an enormous wave rose about
ten yards ahead of it and a terrible noise thundered out like an
explosion. The entire ship was lifted violently and the deck was
showered with a rain of water that was nearly boiling hot; and
landing on the deck with the water was a strong black body which
writhed and let out a sharp loud scream; it was a newt that had been
injured and burnt. The captain ordered the ship full steam astern so
that the ship would not steam straight into the middle of this
turbulent Hell; but the water all around had also begun to erupt and
the surface of the sea was strewn with pieces of dismembered newts.
The ship was finally able to turn around and it fled northwards as
fast as possible. Then there was a terrible explosion about six
hundred yards to the stern and a gigantic column of water and steam,
perhaps a hundred yards high, shot out of the sea. The Oudenbourg
set course for Harwich and sent out a radio warning in all
directions: "Attention all shipping, attention all shipping! Severe
danger on Ostende-Ramsgate lane. Underwater explosion. Cause
unknown. All shipping advised avoid area!" All this time the sea
was thundering and boiling, almost as if military manoeuvres had been
taking place under the water; but apart from the erupting water and
steam there was nothing to see. From both Dover and Calais,
destroyers and torpedo boats set out at full steam and squadrons of
military aircraft flew to the site of the disturbance; but by the
time they got there all they found was that the surface was
discoloured with something like a yellow mud and covered with
startled fish and newts that had been torn to pieces. At first it
was thought that a mine in the channel must have exploded; but once
the shores on both sides of the Straits of Dover had been ringed off
with a chain of soldiers and the English prime-minister had, for the
fourth time in the history of the world, interrupted his Saturday
evening and hurried back to London, there were those who thought the
incident must be of extremely serious international importance. The
papers carried some highly alarming rumours, but, oddly enough, this
time remained far from the truth; nobody had any idea that Europe,
and the whole world with it, stood for a few days on the brink of a
major war. It was only several years later that a member of the then
British cabinet, Sir Thomas Mulberry, failed to be re-elected in a
general election and published his memoirs setting out just what had
actually happened; but by then, though, nobody was interested.</p>

<p>This, in short, is what happened: Both England and France had
begun constructing underwater fortresses for the newts in the English
Channel. By means of these fortresses it would have been possible,
in case of war, to close it off to shipping entirely. Then, of
course, both great powers accused the other of having started it
first; but in all probability both sides began fortification at the
same time in the fear that the friendly neighbour across the channel
might get there before they did. In short, two enormous concrete
fortresses armed with heavy cannons, torpedoes, extensive minefields
and all that modern weapon technology could give them, had been
growing steadily under the surface of the Straits of Dover; on the
English side this terrible fortress of the deep was operated by two
divisions of heavy newts and around thirty thousand working
salamanders, on the French side there were three divisions of first
class warrior newts. It seems that on the critical day, a working
colony of British newts came across French salamanders on the seabed
in the middle of the strait and some kind of misunderstanding
developed. The French insisted that their newts had been working
peacefully when they were attacked by the British who wanted to repel
them, that British armed newts had tried to abduct some French newts
who, of course, had defended themselves. At this, British military
salamanders began firing into French labouring newts with hand
grenades and mortars so that the French newts were forced to use
similar weapons. The government of France felt compelled to require
full satisfaction from His Britannic Majesty's government and
complete withdrawal from the disputed area of the seabed in order to
ensure that no similar incident would occur again in the future.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the British government sent a special note to
the government of the French Republic informing them that French
militarised newts had entered the English half of the channel and
were about to lay down mines there. The British newts pointed out
that they were in their working area; at which the French
salamanders, armed to the teeth, responded by throwing hand grenades
which killed several working newts on the British side. It was with
regret that His Majesty's Government felt obliged to require full
satisfaction from the government of the French Republic and the
assurance that French military newts would never again enter the
British side of the English Channel.</p>

<p>At this the French government declared that it could no longer
tolerate having a neighbouring state building underwater
fortifications in immediate proximity to the French coast. As far as
a misunderstanding on the bed of the English Channel was concerned
the republic suggested that, in accordance with the London
Convention, the dispute be presented to the international court in
The Hague. The British government replied that it could not and
would not subject the security of British coasts to decisions made by
any external body. As victims of the French attack they once again
required, and with all possible emphasis, an apology, payment for
damages and a guarantee for the future. British shipping stationed
at Malta steamed westward at full speed; the Atlantic fleet was given
orders to assemble at Portsmouth and Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The French government ordered the mobilisation of its naval
reserve.</p>

<p>It now seemed that neither side could give way; it clearly meant
after all nothing less than mastery over the entire channel. At this
critical moment Sir Thomas Mulberry discovered the surprising fact
that there actually were no working newts or military newts operating
on the English side, or at least not officially, as the British Isles
were still bound by Sir Samuel Mandeville's prohibition on any
salamander working on British coasts or surface waters. This meant
that the British government could not officially maintain that French
newts had attacked any English newts; the whole issue therefore was
reduced to the question whether French newts, deliberately or in
error, had crossed over into British sovereign waters. French
officials promised that they would investigate the matter; the
English government never even suggested that the matter should be
presented to the international court in The Hague. Finally the
British admiralty came to an agreement with the French admiralty that
there would be a five kilometre wide neutral zone between underwater
fortifications in the English Channel, and in this way the
exceptional friendliness existing between the two states was
confirmed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<h4>THE NORTHERN NEWT</h4>

<p>Not many years after the first newt colonies had been settled in
the North Sea and the Baltic a German scientist, Dr. Hans
Th&Atilde;&frac14;ring, found that the Baltic newt had certain
distinctive physical features--clearly as a result of its
environment; that it was somewhat lighter in colour, it walked on two
legs, and its cranial index indicated a skull that was longer and
narrower than other newts. This variety was given the name Northern
Newt or Noble Newt (Andrias Scheuchzeri var. nobilis erecta
Th&Atilde;&frac14;ring).</p>

<p>The German press took this Baltic newt as its own, and
enthusiastically stressed that it was because of its German
environment that this newt had developed into a different and
superior sub-species, indisputably above the level of any other
salamander. Journalists wrote with contempt of the degenerate newts
of the Mediterranean, stunted both physically and mentally, of the
savage newts of the tropics and of the inferior, barbaric and bestial
newts of other nations. The slogan of the day was From the Great
Newt to the German &Atilde;&oelig;bernewt. And what had been the
origin of all the latter day newts on German soil? Had its glorious
miocene skull not been found in &Atilde;&mdash;hningen by the learned
German Doctor Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer? There was therefore not the
slightest doubt that the original Andrias Scheuchzeri had had its
origin in the geological past on German soil; its migration to other
seas and climatic zones was something it had had to pay for with its
decline and degeneration; but as soon as it found itself back on the
soil of its homeland it once again became what it had been in the
past: the noble northern Scheuchzer Newt, light in colour, erect in
gait and long in skull. It was only on German soil that newts could
return to their pure and highest form, such as it had been found by
the great Johannes Jakob Scheuchzer from the impression in the quarry
at &Atilde;&mdash;hningen. This was why Germany needed new and
longer shores, it needed colonies, it needed the seas of the world so
that a new generation of racially pure, original German salamanders
could develop in German waters. We need new living room for our
newts, wrote the German newspapers; and so that this fact was always
present to the German eyes a grand memorial to Johannes Jakob
Scheuchzer was set up in Berlin. The great doctor was depicted with
a thick book in his hand; at his sits the erect and noble Nordic
newt, gazing into the distance towards the boundless shores of the
worlds oceans. There was, of course, a celebratory speech given at
the unveiling of this national monument, and it attracted the
attention of newspapers all around the world. A New Threat from
Germany, asserted, in particular, the press in England. We have
become used to this sort of tone but if, on an official occasion such
as this, we are told that Germany is in need of five thousand
kilometres of new coastline within three years we have to choice but
to give a clear response: Just You Try It! See what happens if you
encroach on British shores. We are prepared, and in three years time
we will be even better prepared. England must have--and will have--
a navy as large as the two biggest continental powers put together;
this relation of power cannot ever be changed. Anyone who wishes to
unleash an insane arms race in naval weaponry is welcome to try; no
Briton will ever allow his country to fall a single step behind.</p>

<p>"We accept the challenge laid down by the Germans," declared the
first lord of the admiralty, Sir Francis Drake, in parliament and
speaking on behalf of the government. "Whoever tries to lay a hand
on any of the worlds oceans will have to find himself facing the
might of our ships. The British Empire is strong enough to repel any
assault on its outposts or the shores of its colonies and dominions.
The construction of new land, island, fortress or airbase in any sea
will be considered an attack of this sort if its waves wash onto
coastline under British dominion, however tiny. Let this be the last
warning to anyone who might wish to change the outline of the world's
seas, even if by no more than a yard." In response, parliament
allowed the construction of new warships at a preliminary cost of
half a million pounds sterling. It was indeed an impressive response
to the construction of the provocative memorial to Johannes Jakob
Scheuchzer in Berlin; this memorial had cost no more than twelve
thousand reichsmark.</p>

<p>The outstanding French publicist, the Marquis de Sade, who was
always well informed, responded to this speech in this way: The
British first lord of the admiralty declares that Great Britain is
ready for any eventuality. That is all well and good, but is the
noble lord aware that Germany has a standing army of heavily armed
newts in the Baltic, currently comprising five million professional
salamander soldiers, who are ready to engage in military action at
any time on land or sea? On top of that must be considered the
seventeen million newts engaged in technical and supportive functions
who act as a reserve and are ready, at any time, to become an army of
occupation? The Baltic salamander is presently the greatest soldier
in the world; trained to the perfect mentality, it sees war is its
proper vocation and the most noble; it enters every battle with the
enthusiasm of a fanatic, with cool technical planning and the awful
discipline of Prussia.</p>

<p>And is the British First Lord of the Admiralty moreover aware that
Germany is frantically building new transport ships, any one of which
can carry a whole brigade of warrior salamanders? Is he aware that
hundreds and hundreds of small submarines are being built with a
range of three to five thousand kilometres and whose crew will
consist of Baltic newts? Is he aware that gigantic underwater fuel
depots are being established in various places? So now, let us ask
the question once again: can the British citizen be certain that his
great country really is well prepared for any eventuality?</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine, the Marquis de Sade continued,
what a difference could be made to the outcome the next war by newts
blockading the coasts and equipped with underwater howitzers, mortars
and torpedoes; by my faith, this is the first time in history that
no-one need envy the English in their splendid isolation surrounded
by water. And while we are addressing these questions: is the
British admiralty aware also that the Baltic newts are equipped with
a new, normally peaceful, apparatus called the pneumatic drill which
is capable of drilling ten metres deep into the best Swedish granite
in an hour and can penetrate fifty or sixty metres deep into English
chalk in the same time? (This was ascertained by secret experiments
carried out at night by the German technical expedition on the
eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth of last month on the English coast
between Hythe and Folkestone right under the nose of Dover Castle.)
I suggest that our friends across the channel calculate for
themselves how many weeks it would take for Kent or Essex to be
drilled through below sea level like a piece of Swiss cheese. Until
now, the Englishman on his island has always looked anxiously to the
horizon as the place from which any harm to his flourishing cities,
his Bank of England or his warm cottage, so cosy in its evergreen
coat of ivy, might come. But now he had better put his ear to the
ground where his children are playing: might he not hear, maybe
today, maybe tomorrow, a digging and a scraping as, step by step, the
newts with these tireless and fearsome drills grind their way deeper
to create the paths for laying hitherto unknown explosives. The last
word of the age we live in is not war in the air, it is war beneath
the water and the land. We have heard the self confident words from
the commanders of proud Albion; the ship of Albion today is still a
vessel of great power, borne on the waves and master of them; but
there might come a day when the waves will close over a vessel that
has been broken and send it down to the depths of the ocean. Would
it not be better to face this danger sooner rather than later?
Within three years it will be too late!</p>

<p>The Marquis de Sade was a brilliant publicist, and his warning
caused great consternation in England; despite all the denials,
people in every part of England were able to hear the newts drilling
into the ground beneath their feet. Officials in Germany, of course,
issued a categorical denial and repudiated the Marquis' speech,
declaring that from start to finish it was no more than provocation
and hostile propaganda; at the same time, however, combined
manoeuvres were taking place in the Baltic involving the German navy,
land forces and warrior newts; squads of sapper newts, in full view
of foreign military attach&Atilde;&copy;s, under-drilled and blew up
six square kilometres of sand dunes near R&Atilde;&frac14;genwald.
It was said to be a wonderful spectacle when, with a terrifying roar,
the ground rose up and an enormous wall of steam, sand and tree
trunks flew skywards; it became as dark as night, and the sand that
had been thrown up was scattered over a radius of nearly fifty
kilometres, even as far away as Warsaw there was still a sandy rain
falling several days later. This enormous explosion left so much
fine sand and dust suspended in the atmosphere that all through the
rest of that year the sunsets throughout Europe were exceptionally
beautiful, coloured a bloody red, and fiery like never before. The
sea created after this piece of coast had been blown away was later
given the name the Scheuchzer See, and it was the destination for
countless school trips for German children singing their favourite
newt anthem, Solche Erfolche erreichen nur deutsche Molche.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<h4>WOLF MEYNERT WRITES HIS OEUVRE</h4>

<p>It may have been just those tragically glorious sunsets that
inspired the lone philosopher, Wolf Meynert, to write his monumental
work, The Decline and Fall of Man. We can easily imagine him as he
ambles along the shore, his hair loose and his raincoat flapping in
the wind, gazing enthralled at the sky that has turned into a blaze
of fire and blood. "Yes," he mutters absent mindedly, "yes, now is
the time to write the afterword to the history of mankind!" And so
he wrote it.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the human race has reached its final curtain, Wolf
Meynert began. Despite mans lust for enterprise and technical
prosperity, all this is no more than the lurid red on the face of an
organism already condemned to die. Man has never before come face to
face with such an elevated conjuncture in the life of his species
than today; but find me one man who is happy; show me the class that
lives in contentment, the nation that does not fear its existence
under threat. In the midst of all the gifts of civilisation, in the
rich luxury of material and spiritual property we are all of us
falling inexorably into doubt, anguish and unease. Thus Wolf Meynert
went on, with irrefutable logic, to analyse the spiritual state of
the modern word, this mix of fear and uncertainty, mistrust and
megalomania, cynicism and pettiness: in a word, Wolf Meynert
concluded, desperation. Typical portents of the end. Moral
agony.</p>

<p>So the question is: When was man ever capable of happiness?
Individuals, yes, just like any other living thing; but mankind,
never. The whole of mans misfortunes arise because he had to become
human, or that he became human too late when he was already
incorrigibly differentiated into nations and races and faiths and
classes and factions and rich and poor and educated and uneducated
and lords and slaves. If you take horses, wolves, sheep, cats,
foxes, deer, bears and goats, and you herd them into one fold and
force them to live in this nonsensical mix-up that you call the Rules
of Society and force them to observe these rules, then the result
will be unhappiness, discontent and death, a society where not even a
divine being could feel at home. That is a more or less precise
depiction of the big and hopeless heterogenous herd that we call
mankind. Nations, classes, factions cannot all live together in the
long term without causing each other worries and getting in each
others way until it becomes unbearable; they can all live separated
from each other--which was only possible for as long as the world
was big enough for them--or they can live against each other, in a
struggle of life and death. Biological entities such as race, nation
and class have only, where people are concerned, one natural road to
take, and that is towards a homogenous and undisturbed bliss; to make
a place for themselves and annihilate the others. And that is just
what the human race failed to do in time. Now it is too late. We
have set up too many doctrines and obligations for ourselves with
which we protect these "others" instead of getting rid of them; we
have thought up a code of morals, human rights, contracts, laws,
equality, humanity and all the rest; we have created a fictitious
mankind which includes ourselves and these "others" in some imaginary
higher unit. What a fatal mistake! We have set our law of morals
above the laws of biology. We have violated the great natural
assumption of all societies; that only a homogenous society can be a
happy society. And this attainable prosperity is something that we
have sacrificed to a great but impossible dream: the creation of one
mankind and one social and moral code for all people, nations,
classes and factions. Grandiose stupidity. In its way it was man's
only honourable attempt to rise above himself. And now he has to pay
for this supreme idealism with his own inevitable end.</p>

<p>The process by which man tries to organise himself in society is
as old as civilisation itself, as old as the first laws and the first
communities; after all these millennia, all that he has attained is
the deepening of the gulf between races, nations and classes; world
opinions have dug themselves deep and firm in the bottomless pit that
we see today, and we cannot fail to see that mans unfortunate and
historic attempt to make all peoples into one mankind has
definitively and tragically collapsed. We are finally beginning to
realise it; and that is why there are these plans and efforts to
unite human society in a different way, a radical way, the way of
making room just for one nation, just for one class or just for one
faith. But who can say how deeply we have already been infected with
the incurable disease of differentiation? Sooner or later, every
supposedly homogenous unit inevitably breaks back down into a
disparate jumble of various interests, parties, classes and so on,
who will either persecute each other or will suffer together in
silence. There is no way out. We are caught in a vicious circle;
but history will not continue going round in circles forever. Nature
herself has taken care of that by creating a place on Earth for the
newts.</p>

<p>It is by more than mere chance, Wolf Meynert went on, that the
newts have burgeoned just at the time when mans chronic disease, this
badly assembled and quickly decaying super-organism, will progress
into agony. With few insignificant exceptions, the newts are the
only homogenous and large-scale unit; they have so far failed to
create any deep distinctions of race, language, nation, state, faith
class or caste; there are no masters and slaves among them, no
freemen and serfs, no rich and poor; differences have been imposed
upon them by their type of work, but for their own perceptions they
are of one family, a monolith, of one seed, in all their parts they
have the same primitive biology, the same poor natural endowments,
the same burdens, and the same low living standard. The last Negroes
and Eskimos have incomparably higher living conditions, enjoy
infinitely richer property both materially and culturally, than these
billions of civilised newts. And there is not even any indication of
suffering among the newts. On the contrary. What we see is that
they have no need of any of the things with which man seeks escape
and relief from the worries of his life or the horrors of his
metaphysics; they survive adequately without philosophy, without life
after death and without art; they do not know what are fantasy,
humour, mysticism, game-playing or dreams; they go through life
simply as realists. They are as remote from man as ants or herrings;
and they distinguish themselves from ants and herrings only by having
moved over into the environment of another species, the civilisation
of man. There they have settled themselves just as dogs have settled
into mans shelter; they cannot live without it, but they do not cease
to be what they are; a very primitive and little differentiated type
of animal. All they wish to do is live and multiply; they might even
be happy, for there is no sense of inequality to disturb them. They
are simply homogenous. For this reason they might one day, indeed
one day very soon, find no difficulty in doing that which has escaped
the efforts of man: to disperse their species with its unity intact
all around the globe, a single global community, in a word, universal
newtdom. This day will see the end of millennia of agony for the
human genus. Our planet will not have enough room for two faction,
both of which strive to dominate the whole world. One of them must
give way. We know already which that will be.</p>

<p>Distributed around the globe today are around twenty thousand
million civilised newts, which is about ten times more than all
people put together; it is both a matter of historical logic and
biological necessity that the newts that man has subjugated will some
day free themselves; that being homogenous they will unite; and that
thus having become the greatest power the world has ever seen they
will take over. Could anyone be such a fool as to think they would
then spare mankind? Could anyone think they will repeat the mistake,
made again and again throughout history, of exploiting the defeated
nations and classes instead of just annihilating them? Would it be
in their interest to keep establishing new differences between men so
that then, simply through generosity and idealism, they would try to
overcome them? No, this is a historic error that the newts will not
commit, declared Wolf Meynert, if only because they will have been
warned in this book! They will be the inheritors of the whole of
human civilisation; all that we have done or attempted to do in our
efforts to shape the world will simply fall into their laps; but if
they tried to include ourselves with this legacy, they would be
acting against their own interests. They must rid themselves of
mankind if they wish to maintain their own uniformity. If they
failed to act thus they would they would create, sooner or later,
their own destructive tendency among themselves: they would create
differences and they would have to endure them. But this is
something of which we should have no fear; there is today no creature
that will continue the history of mankind that would repeat his
suicidal madness.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the world of the newts will be happier than
that of mankind; it will be unified, homogenous and governed
everywhere in the same spirit. Newt will not be distinct from newt
by language, opinion, faith or his requisites for life. There will
be no differences among them of culture or class, merely the
allocation of tasks. No-one will be master or slave, as all will
serve just one Great Newt Whole which will be god, government,
employer and spiritual leader. There will be just one nation and
just one class. The world will be better and more perfect than ours
will have been. This is the only possible Brave New World. Let us
therefore make room for it; man is facing his expiry, and there is no
more that he can do than to hasten his end with tragic beauty, that
is, if it is not too late even for that.</p>

<p>Now lets express the views of Wolf Meynert in a way that is more
accessible: we are aware that in this way it will lose a lot of its
force and its depth, which was so fascinating for the whole of Europe
in its time. The young were especially fascinated and adopted a
faith in the decline and annihilation of mankind with great
enthusiasm. The German Reich banned the teaching of the great
pessimist for a number of political reasons and Wolf Meynert had to
flee into Switzerland, but the whole of the educated world was
nonetheless content to adopt Meynert's theories about the end of
mankind; his book, 632 pages long, was published in all the languages
of the world and many millions of copies were distributed, even among
the newts.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<h4>X GIVES HIS WARNING</h4>

<p>It may have been as a result of this prophetic book that the
literary and artistic avant garde in all the cultural centres
declared, After Us, the Salamanders!, The Future belongs to the
Newts, Newts Mean Cultural Revolution. Even if they don't have their
own art (they explained) at least they are not burdened with idiotic
ideals, dried up traditions and all the rigid and boring things
taught in schools and given the name of poetry, music, architecture,
philosophy and culture in any of its forms. The word culture is
senile and it makes us sick. Human art has been with us for too long
and is worn-out and if the newts have never fallen for it we will
make a new art for them. We, the young, will blaze the path for a
new world of salamandrism: we wish to be the first newts, we are the
salamanders of tomorrow! And so the young poetic movement of
salamandrism was born, triton--or tritone--music was composed and
pelagic painting, inspired by the shape world of jellyfish, fish and
corals, made its appearance. There were also the water regulating
structures made by the newts themselves which were discovered as a
new source of beauty and dignity. We've had enough of nature, the
slogans went; bring on the smooth, concrete shores instead of the old
and ragged cliffs! Romanticism is dead; the continents of the future
will be outlined with clean straight lines and re-shaped into conic
sections and rhombuses; the old geological must be replaced with a
world of geometry. In short, there was once again a new trend that
was to be the thing of the future, a new aesthetic sensation and new
cultural manifestoes; anyone who failed to join in with the rise of
salamandrism before it was too late felt bitterly that he had missed
his time, and he would take his revenge by making calls for the
purity of mankind, a return to the values of the people and nature
and other reactionary slogans. A concert of tritone music was booed
off the stage in Vienna, at the Salon des Ind&Atilde;&copy;pendents
in Paris a pelagic painting called Capriccio en Bleu was slashed by
an unidentified perpetrator; salamandrism was simply victorious, and
its rise was unstoppable.</p>

<p>Needless to say, there was no shortage of those who were opposed
to this change and stood against "newtmania" as it was called. The
most fundamentalist piece of opposition came in the form of an
anonymous pamphlet that came out in England under the title X Gives
his Warning. The leaflet enjoyed wide circulation, but the identity
of its author was never established; there were many who thought it
must have been written by some high official in the church, swayed by
the observation that X is an abbreviation for Christ.</p>

<p>In the first chapter the author tried to use statistics about the
newts, apologising at the same time for the inaccuracy of the figures
he was using. The estimated total number of salamanders at this time
ranged between seven and twenty times the total number of people on
the Earth. It was just as uncertain how many factories, oil wells,
weed plantations, and eel farms the newts had under the sea making
use of water power and other natural sources of energy; there were
not even any estimates of the newts industrial manufacturing
capacity; least of all did anyone know how well armed the newts
were. We knew that the salamanders were dependent on people for
their metals, engineering parts, explosives and many types of
chemical, but not only did every state keep strictly secret how much
weaponry and other products their supplied to their newts, but we
also knew remarkably little about what the newts did with the
materials they bought from people once they were down in the depths
of the sea. One thing that was certain was that the newts did not
want people to know these things; over the previous few years so many
divers sent down to the seabed had been drowned that it could not
possibly be seen as mere chance. It hardly need be said how worrying
this was, both from the industrial point of view and the military.
It is obviously very difficult to imagine, X continued in the
following paragraphs, what the newts might want of people, or how
much they could simply take. They cannot live on dry land and there
is no way for us to dictate to them what they do under the water.
Our respective living environments are completely and unchangeably
separate. We require a certain amount of work from them, but in
return we give them plenty of food and provide them with raw
materials and products such as metals that, without us, they would
not have at all. But even if there is no practical reason for any
animosity between ourselves and the newts there is, I would say,
metaphysical reason: contrasted with creatures of the surface we see
creatures of the deep abyss; creatures of the night with creatures of
the day; dark ponds of water with bright, dry land. The boundary
between water and land has somehow become sharper than it used to be:
our land borders on their water. We could live perfectly well
separate from each other, exchanging no more than certain goods and
services, indefinitely; but it is hard to rid ourselves of the fear
that that is not how things will turn out. And why not? I am not
able to give you any precise reasons; but this fear is nonetheless
with us; it seems like some kind of intuition that one day the sea
itself will turn against the land to settle the question of who lives
with whom.</p>

<p>I have to admit that this anxiety is somewhat irrational, X went
on; but it would seem like a great relief if the newts came out
against mankind with some kind of demands. We would at least then
have the chance to negotiate with them, we would be able to make
various concessions, contracts and compromises with them; but this
silence of theirs is a thing of horror. This incomprehensible
reticence makes me afraid. They might, for instance, wish to ask for
certain political advantages for themselves; legislation about the
newts is, to put it bluntly, outdated in every state of the world and
is not worthy of the dignity of a creature as civilised as the newts
nor of a creature so strong in numbers. There is a need to work out
new rights and responsibilities for the newts, and to do so in the
way that will be of most advantage to them; their working conditions
must be improved and they must be better rewarded for the amount of
work they do. There are many ways in which their circumstances could
be improved if only they would ask for it. Then we would be in a
position to make certain concessions and bind ourselves to proper
contracts with proper pay; at the very least this would buy time for
a number of years. However, the newts ask for nothing; all they do
is raise their output and order more supplies; now is the time when
we need to ask where, on both sides, this will all come to an end.
We used formerly to talk about the yellow peril, or black or red; but
they were at least people, and we can at least have some idea of what
it is that people will want. But even if we still have no idea how
to defend ourselves or even whom we are to defend ourselves against
there is one thing that is quite clear: that if the newts stand on
one side then the whole of mankind will be on the other.</p>

<p>People against newts! The time has come when it needs to be
formulated thus. It must be said frankly that the normal person has
an instinctive hatred of the salamanders, he loathes them--and he is
afraid of them. There is something like a chill veil of horror that
has fallen over the whole of mankind. How else are we to explain
this frenetic worldliness, this insatiable thirst for fun and
debauchery, this orgiastic abandon that has taken control of peoples
minds? There has never been a comparable collapse of morals since
the time when the Roman Empire collapsed under the onslaught of the
barbarians. This is more than the fruit of unprecedented material
prosperity, it is the desperation born of suppressed fear and anguish
at the thought of our own overturn and annihilation. Drink deep the
last goblet, for tomorrow we die! What a disgrace, what a
punishment! It seems that God, in His terrible mercy, wishes to
allow nations and classes to perish if once they have begun to rush
down the road to destruction. Are we to read mene tekel in fiery
letters at the feast of mankind? Look at the words written in light
shining all through the hours of darkness on the walls of our
debauched and dissolute cities! In this way we human beings are
already comparable with the newts: we live more by night than by
day.</p>

<p>If only these salamanders were not so horribly mediocre, exclaimed
X in his anxiety. It is true that they are, to some extent,
educated, but this has the effect of limiting them further as all
that they have taken from human civilisation is that which is the
most commonplace and useful, things that are mechanical and
repeatable. They stand at the side of man like Wagner at the side of
Faust; they learn from these books like the human Faust but with this
difference, that this is all they want and suffer from no doubts or
questions. The most horrifying thing is that this type of civilised
mediocrity, educable but dull and complacent, exists on such a large
scale; millions and thousands of millions of individuals all the
same; or rather, perhaps I am mistaken, and the most horrifying thing
of all is that they have been so successful. They have taught
themselves to use machines and numbers, and they have shown that that
is all that is needed to become masters of the world. All parts of
human civilisation that are without purpose, that are playful,
fantastic or antiquated, they have ignored; in this way they have
ignored all that makes man human, adopting only that which is purely
practical, technical and utilisable. And this pitiful caricature of
human civilisation has achieved awesome things; it builds wonders of
technology, renovates our old planet and is even a source of
fascination of people themselves. From Wagner, his apprentice and
servant, Faust learned the secret of success and of mediocrity.
Mankind has either to engage in an epoch-making conflict of life and
death with the newts or he will become like the newts, never to
regain his humanness. As far as I am concerned, X concluded sadly, I
would rather see the former.</p>

<p>X now gives you his warning, the unknown author continued. It is
still possible to shake off this cold and slimey ring that is wrapped
around us all. We must rid ourselves of the salamanders. There are
already too many of them; they are armed, we know almost nothing
about the power of their weapons and they could well turn them
against us; but a danger for us more horrible than mere strength and
numbers is the success, nay triumph, achieved by their lack of self
worth. We do not know what it is that we are to fear more; the
technology they have taken from human beings, or their sinister, cold
and bestial cruelty; but the two of them together create something
inconceivably terrifying and almost diabolic. In the name of
culture, in the name of Christianity and mankind we must free
ourselves from these newts. And here he called on an unnamed
apostle:</p>

<p>You madmen, stop feeding the newts! Stop employing them, eschew
their services, let them move away somewhere else where they will
feed themselves just like any other sea creature! Nature herself has
already created order in her copious bounty; but only if people--
human civilisation and human history--will stop working for the
salamanders!</p>

<p>And stop providing the newts with weapons, end their supply of
metals and explosives, send them no more of the machinery and
equipment made by man! We do not give the tiger his teeth or venom
to the snake; we do not stoke the fires of volcanoes or undermine our
dams. Let us ban supplies to any of the seas of the world, let us
place the newts outside the law, let them be cursed and banished from
our world, let there be a League of Nations to unite us against the
newts! The whole of mankind must be prepared to defend its existence
with sword in hand; let the king of Sweden, the Pope of Rome or a
union of nations call a world conference to unite all the civilised
states of the world, let us create a united world--or at least a
union of all Christian nations--wherewith to oppose the
salamanders! We are today at a turning point. Under the terrible
pressure of the salamander threat, it is possible for man to behave
responsibly and create a United States of the World to avoid a world
war with all its countless victims. May God will it! If it is His
will, then the newts will not have come in vain and will have been
the instrument of God.</p>



<p>This pathetic pamphlet excited wide support among the general
public. Old women, in particular, agreed that there had been an
unprecedented decline in moral values. On the other hand, the
business pages of the newspapers pointed out it would not be possible
to reduce the goods supplied to the newts without causing a serious
decline in human industrial output and a crisis in many other areas.
Agriculture had come to depend on an enormous demand for maize,
potatoes and other crops used for newt fodder; if the number of
salamanders was reduced there would be a sharp decline in the market
price of foodstuffs which would bring farmers to the brink of ruin.
The trades unions suspected Mr. X was just a reactionary and declared
that they would not allow anything that would impede the supply of
goods to the newts; the working man had only just achieved full
employment and a proper wage and now Mr. X was wanting to snatch the
bread from their hands; the working class is in sympathy with the
newts and rejects any attempt to lower their standard of living or
deliver them, poor and defenceless, into the hands of capitalism. As
far as any League of Nations against the newts was concerned, they
denied that there could be any serious political circumstances when
it could be needed; there were indeed both the Society of Nations and
the London Convention in which sea-going states bound themselves not
to equip their newts with heavy weaponry. Needless to say, it is not
easy to persuade any state to disarm if it cannot be sure that no
other seagoing power is not arming its newts in secret and thereby
raising its military power at the expense of its neighbours.
Likewise, no state or continent is able to force its newts to move
somewhere else, simply because that would have the undesirable effect
of raising the industrial and agricultural output, not to mention the
military power, of other states and continents. And objections of
this sort, which any thinking person would have to acknowledge, were
raised everywhere.</p>

<p>Despite all this, the pamphlet, <em>X Gives his Warning</em>, had
far reaching effects. Movements to oppose the newts spread to almost
every country in the world and a variety of organisations such as The
Association for the Elimination of the Newts, The Anti-Salamander
Club, The Committee for Human Protection were established
everywhere. Newt delegates at the thirteenth session of the
Commission for the Study of Newt Affairs in Geneva were insulted when
they tried to take part. The boards that fenced off the coastline
were daubed with threatening graffiti such as Death to the Newts,
Salamanders Go Home etc. Many newts had stones thrown at them; no
salamander now dared to raise his head above water in daylight. But,
despite all of this, there was no sign whatever from them of protest
or attempt at retaliation. They were simply invisible, by day at
least; and the people who peered through the barriers saw no more
than the endless and wearily soughing waves.  "Just look at these
monstrosities," they said with hatred, "they won't even show
themselves!"</p>

<p>And it was this tense silence that was suddenly broken by the
thunder of the Louisiana Earthquake.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<h4>THE LOUISIANA EARTHQUAKE</h4>

<p>On that day, on the 11th. November at one o'clock in the morning,
there was a powerful earth tremor felt in New Orleans; some of the
buildings in the black areas collapsed; people ran out onto the
street in panic, but there was no second tremor; there was only a
short, howling cyclone that struck with a sudden furious onslaught,
smashing windows and blowing the rooves off the houses where the
negroes lived; a few dozen people were killed; and then there was a
heavy downpour of mud.</p>

<p>As the New Orleans firemen went out to help in the worst affected
areas, telegrams were tapped out from Morgan City, Plaquemine, Baton
Rouge and Lafayette: SOS! Send help! City half destroyed by
earthquake and cyclone; Mississippi dam at risk of breaking; send
searchers, ambulances, all able-bodied men immediately!--From Fort
Livingston there was only this laconic question: Hello, anything
happening there? It was followed by a message from Lafayette:
Attention! Attention! Worst affected New Iberia. Connection between
Iberia and Morgan City seems broken. Send help there!--Morgan City
telephoned in reply: No communications with New Iberia. Roads and
railroads seem destroyed. Send ships and airplanes to Vermillion
Bay! We need nothing. Have around thirty dead and hundred injured.
--Then a telegram came from Baton Rouge: Received news, worst
affected New Iberia. Concentrate resources New Iberia. Here need
only workers, urgent, dam in danger of breaking. Doing all
possible. And then: Hello, hello, Shreveport, Natchitoches,
Alexandria sending trains with help to New Iberia. Hello, hello,
Memphis, Winana, Jackson sending trains via Orleans. All vehicles
heading dam Baton Rouge.--Hello, Pascagoula here. Some dead here.
Need help?</p>

<p>By now fire engines, ambulances and trainfuls of helpers and
supplies were on their way to Morgan city--Patterson--Franklin. It
was not until after four in the morning that the first accurate news
arrived: Railroad closed by floods between Franklin and New Iberia,
five miles west of Franklin; seems deep fissure opened by earthquake,
connects with Vermillion Bay and flooded with seawater. As far as
ascertained, fissure extends from Vermillion Bay east-northeast, near
Franklin turns northwards, opens into Grand Lake, continues
northwards until line Plaquemine--Lafayette, ending in former lake;
second branch fissure connects Grand Lake westwards with
Napoleonville Lake. Fissure around fifty miles total length, width
one to seven miles. Epicenter apparently here. Seems amazing luck
fissure missed all major towns. Loss of life nonetheless
substantial. In Franklin twenty-four inches rain of mud, in
Patterson eighteen inches. Reports from Atchafalaya Bay, sea
retreated two miles at time of earthquake, then hundred foot tidal
wave. Feared many dead on coast. Still no communication with New
Iberia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a train carrying supplies from Natchitoches entered New
Iberia from the west; the first reports, sent by a roundabout route
via Lafayette and Baton Rouge, were awful. The train had not been
able to get closer than a few miles from New Iberia because the track
had been swept away by the mud. As people fled from the disaster
they reported that a volcano of mud had erupted a couple of miles to
the east of the town and instantly drenched the area with a thin,
cold rain of it; New Iberia, they said, had disappeared under an
onslaught of mud. All work was made extremely difficult by the dark
and the continuing rain of mud. There was still no direct connection
with New Iberia.</p>

<p>At the same time, news arrived from Baton Rouge:</p>

<div class="quote telegram">
<p>thousands of men working on mississippi dam stop if only rain
would stop stop need picks shovels trucks workers stop sending help
to plaquemine</p>
</div>

<p>Dispatch from Fort Jackson:</p>

<div class="quote telegram">
<p>one thirty morning sea wave destroyed thirty houses don't know
what it was approximately seventy people swept to sea only now
repaired equipment post office destroyed hello wire saying what
happened urgent telegrapher fred dalton hello please tell minnie im
ok apart from broken hand and loss of clothes but at least equipment
ok fred</p>
</div>

<p>The report from Port Eads was somewhat shorter:</p>

<div class="quote telegram">
<p>some dead burywood swept entirely to sea</p>
</div>

<p>By about eight in the morning the first aircraft sent to help the
affected areas had returned. The whole of the coast from Port Arthur
(Texas) to Mobile (Alabama) had been hit by a tidal wave; ruined or
damaged buildings were everywhere. The south-eastern part of
Louisiana (from the road between Lake Charles and Alexandria to
Natchez) and the south of Mississippi (as far as the line Jackson--
Hattiesburg--Pascagoula) were swamped with mud. A new bay stretched
inland from Vermillion Bay, two to eight miles wide and reaching in
on a zig-zag line almost as far as Plaquemine like a long fjord. New
Iberia seemed to have been seriously damaged but many people could be
seen digging the mud away from roads and houses. Impossible to
land. The most serious loss of life likely to have been on the
coast. A steamer, clearly from Mexico, sunk off Point au Fer. Sea
around Chandeleur Islands covered in debris. Rain easing off over
the entire area. Visibility good.</p>

<p>The first special issue of the New Orleans paper went out at just
after four in the morning; as the day went on more issues were
published and the details accumulated; at eight in the morning
appeared the first photographs of the affected areas with maps of the
new inlets from the sea. At half past eight they printed an
interview with the celebrated seismologist from Memphis University,
Dr. Wilbur R. Bownell, about the cause of the earthquake in
Louisiana. It's still too early to come to any firm conclusions, the
famous scientist declared, but it seems that these tremors have
nothing to do with the volcanic activity, which has been so active up
till now, in the volcano belt of central Mexico which lies directly
across from the affected area. Today's earthquake seems rather to be
of tectonic origin, that's to say it was caused by the weight and
pressure of mountains: one the one side there are the Rocky Mountains
and the Sierra Madre, and on the other side there are Appalachian
Hills on the extensive lowlands of the Gulf of Mexico which continue
down to the mouth of the Mississippi. The chasm that now runs up
from Vermillion Bay is only small and insignificant compared with the
geological collapse that has already created the Gulf of Mexico and
the Caribbean Sea, along with the ring of islands that make up the
Greater and Lesser Antilles, which were once a range of mountains.
There is no doubt whatsoever that this subsidence in central America
will continue with new tremors, new faults and new chasms appearing;
it is even possible that the fault running up from Vermilion Bay is
no more than a prelude to the reactivation of the tectonic process
with its center in the Gulf of Mexico; and if that is the case we
might well be witnesses to an enormous geological catastrophe in
which nearly a fifth of the United States might end up as seabed.
But if that really is the case there is a certain likelihood that the
ocean bed in the region of the Antilles will start to rise, or it
could be somewhat further east where, according to the ancient
legends, we might hope to find the sunken city of Atlantis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the scientist continued more reassuringly, we
need not take seriously any fear of volcanic activity in the affected
areas; these craters hurling mud into the air are nothing more than
eruptions of natural gas which must have been under the Vermilion
fault. It wouldn't be at all surprising to find gigantic caverns of
gas underneath the Mississippi Delta area, and these caverns of
natural gas can explode when they come into contact with the air,
hurling hundreds of thousands of tons of water and mud into the air
as they do so. But of course, before we can come to any definitive
conclusions, Dr. W.R. Brownell repeated, we will need to obtain more
data.</p>

<p>While Dr. Brownell's geological observations on the catastrophe
went to press, the governor of the state of Louisiana received this
telegram from Fort Jackson:</p>

<div class="quote telegram">
<p>regret loss of human life stop tried to miss your cities but
didn't expect retreat of seawater and tidal wave after explosion stop

<p>The governor of the state of Louisiana pored long over this
telegram. Some kind of joker, this Fred Dalton, I reckon, he finally
said. Best not to give this to the papers.</p>
</div>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<h4>CHIEF SALAMANDER MAKES HIS DEMANDS</h4>

<p>Three days after the earthquake in Louisiana there was another
geological catastrophe announced, this time in China. The coast of
the province of Kiangsu, north of Nanking, about half way between the
mouth of the Yangtse and the old bed of the Hwangho, was ripped apart
in a powerful, thunderous earthquake; the sea gushed into this
fissure and joined up with the great lakes of Pan Yoon and Hungtsu
between the cities of Hwaingan and Fugyang. Apparently as a result
of the earthquake, the Yangtse left its course below Nanking and
flowed down towards Lake Tai and on to Hang-Cho. Loss of human life
cannot, so far, even be estimated. Hundred of thousands of refugees
are fleeing into the provinces to the north and south. Japanese
warships have been given orders to sail to the affected area.</p>

<p>Although the earthquake in Kiangsu was far more extensive than the
disaster in Louisiana it attracted little attention in the world
press because everyone was used to catastrophes happening in China
and the loss of some million lives did not seem very important; and
besides, it was scientifically clear that it was only a tectonic
earthquake to do with the deep sea trench near the Riukiu and
Philippine archipelagoes. But three days later, seismographs in
Europe registered new tremors centred somewhere near the Cape Verde
Islands. More detailed reports stated that the coast of Senegambia,
south of St. Louis, had been hit by a serious earthquake. A deep
fissure appeared between Lampul and Mboro, allowing the sea to gush
in through the Merinagh and as far as Wadi Dimar. Eyewitnesses said
that a column of fire and steam had erupted from the ground with a
terrible noise, hurling sand and stones for miles around; and then
there was the sound of the sea as it rushed into the gulf that had
been opened up. There was no significant loss of life.</p>

<p>This third earthquake stirred up something akin to panic. Were
all the Earths volcanoes becoming active? the papers asked. The
Earths crust is starting to break up, the popular press declared.
Specialists gave their opinion that the Senegambian gulley may have
been no more than the result of a granite eruption by Mount Pico on
the Cape Verde island of Fogo; this volcano had erupted as recently
as 1847 but since then had been considered extinct. In this case,
the west African earthquake had nothing to do with seismic events in
Louisiana and Kiangsu which were clearly tectonic in origin. But
nobody seemed to care whether the Earth was breaking up for tectonic
reasons or volcanic. The fact was that all the churches were filled
to capacity that day and in some areas they had to stay open all
night.</p>

<p>At one in the morning on the 20th. November, radio hams over most
of Europe suffered serious interference to their reception, as if a
new and exceptionally strong broadcaster was operating. They located
the interference at two hundred and three metres; it sounded
something like the noise of machinery or rushing water; then the
continuous, unchanging noise was suddenly interrupted by a horrible,
rasping noise (everyone described it in the same way: a hollow,
nasal, almost synthetic sounding voice, made all the more so by the
electronic apparatus); and this frog-like voice called excitedly,
"Hello, hello, hello! Chief Salamander speaking. Hello, chief
Salamander speaking. Stop all broadcasting, you men! Stop your
broadcasting! Hello, Chief Salamander speaking!" And then another,
strangely hollow voice asked: "Ready?" "Ready." There was a click
as if the broadcast were being transferred to another speaker; and
then another, unnaturally staccato voice called: "Attention!
Attention! Attention!" "Hello!" "Now!"</p>

<p>A voice was heard in the quiet of the night; it was rasping and
tired-sounding but still had the air of authority. "Hello you
people! This is Louisiana. This is Kiangsu. This is Senegambia.
We regret the loss of human life. We have no wish to cause you
unnecessary harm. We wish only that you evacuate those areas of
coast which we will notify you of in advance. If you do as we say
you will avoid anything regrettable. In future we will give you at
least fourteen days notice of the places where we wish to extend our
sea. Incidents so far have been no more than technical experiments.
Your explosives have proved their worth. Thank you for them.</p>

<p>"Hello you people! Remain calm. We wish you no harm. We merely
need more water, more coastline, more shallows in which to live.
There are too many of us. Your coastlines are already too limited
for our needs. For this reason we need to demolish your continents.
We will convert them into bays and islands. In this way, the length
of coastline can be increased five-fold. We will construct new
shallows. We cannot live in deep ocean. We will need your
continents as materials to fill in the deep waters. We wish you no
harm, but there are too many of us. You will be free to migrate
inland. You will not be prevented from fleeing to the hills. The
hills will be the last to be demolished.</p>

<p>"We are here because you wanted us. You have distributed us over
the entire world. Now you have us. We wish that you collaborate
with us. You will provide us with steel for our picks and drills.
you will provide us with explosives. You will provide us with
torpedoes. You will work for us. Without you we will not be able to
remove the old continents. Hello you people, Chief Salamander, in
the name of all newts everywhere, offers collaboration with you. You
will collaborate with us in the demolition of your world. Thank
you."</p>

<p>The tired, rasping voice became silent, and all that was heard was
the constant noise resembling machinery or the sea. "Hello, hello,
you people," the grating voice began again, "we will now entertain
you with music from your gramophone records. Here, for your
pleasure, is the March of the Tritons from the film, Poseidon."</p>



<p>The press, of course, said this nocturnal broadcast was just a
"crude joke", some illicit sender; but there were nonetheless
millions of listeners waiting at their receivers the following night
to find out whether the horrible, earnest and rasping voice would
speak again. It was heard at precisely one o'clock to the
accompaniment of a broad howling and hissing like the sound of the
sea. "Good evening, you people," the voice quacked gaily. "To start
tonight's broadcast, we would like to play you a gramophone recording
of the Salamander Dance from your operetta, Galatea." Once the
shameless clamour of the music had come to its end the voice once
more began its vile and somehow cheerful croaking. "Hello you
people! The British gunboat, Erebus, has just been torpedoed and
sunk in the Atlantic Ocean after it had attempted to destroy our
broadcasting equipment. The entire crew was drowned. Hello, we urge
the British government to issue a statement by radio. The Amenhotep,
registered in Port Said, was reluctant to deliver a cargo of
explosives we had ordered to our port of Makallaha, apparently on the
grounds that orders had been given to refuse any further provisions
of explosives. The ship was, of course, sunk. We advise the
government of the United Kingdom to revoke this order by noon
tomorrow. Failure to do so will result in the sinking of the
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, presently underway in the
North Atlantic with cargoes of grain from Canada to Liverpool.
Hello, we urge the French government to issue a statement by radio.
You are to call back the cruisers presently underway to Senegambia.
Work to widen the newly created bay there is still in progress.
Chief Salamander has given orders that these two governments should
be reassured of his unshakeable friendship towards them. End of
message. We will now, for your pleasure, play you gramophone records
of Salamandria, valse &Atilde;&copy;rotique."</p>

<p>The following afternoon the Manitoba, Winnipeg, Ontario and Quebec
were sunk south-west of Mizen Head. The world was overcome with a
wave of horror. That evening the BBC stated that His Majesty's
Government had prohibited any further supplies of food, chemical
products, machinery, weapons or metals to the newts. At one o'clock
that night an excited voice rasped out from the radio: "Hello, hello,
hello, Chief Salamander speaking! Hello, Chief Salamander is going
to speak!" And then the tired, croaking and angry voice was heard:
"Hello you people! Hello you people! Do you believe we would allow
you to starve us? Do not be so foolish! Whatever you do will be
turned against you! In the name of all newts of the world I call on
Great Britain. With immediate effect, we declare a total blockade of
the British Isles with the exception of the Irish Free State. The
English Channel will be closed off. The Suez Canal will be closed
off. The Straits of Gibraltar will be closed to all shipping. All
British ports will be closed. All British shipping in whatever part
of the world will be torpedoed. Hello, calling Germany. Orders of
explosives are increased ten-fold. They are to be made available
immediately at the main depot on the Skagerrak. Hello, calling
France. Orders of torpedoes are to be met forthwith and supplied to
underwater forts C3, BFF and Quest 5. Hello you people! You have
been warned. If any attempt is made to limit our supplies of
foodstuffs they will be taken from your ships by force. You have
been warned." The tired voice declined to a scarcely comprehensible
croaking. "Hello, calling Italy. You are to prepare for the
evacuation of the territories around Venice, Padova and Udine. You
people have been warned, and warned for the last time. Any more
nonsense from you will not be tolerated." There was a long pause
while nothing was heard but the hissing of the radio like a cold,
black sea. And the gay and quacking voice was heard once more: "And
now we will entertain you with gramophone records of one of your
latest hits, the Triton Trot."</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<h4>CONFERENCE IN VADUZ</h4>

<p>It was an odd sort of war, if indeed it could be called a war at
all; as there was no newt state nor any acknowledged newt government
which could be officially held responsible for the hostilities. The
first country to find itself in a state of war with the salamanders
was Great Britain. Within the first few hours the newts had sunk
almost all British ships at anchor in harbour; there was nothing that
they could have done about that. A number of ships on the open sea
were, for the time being, comparatively safe, mainly because they
were over deep ocean; in this way part of the Royal Navy was saved
and was able then to break through the newt blockade of Malta and
gather over the depths of the Ionian Sea; but even these units were
soon sought out by the newts in their mini-submarines and sunk one by
one. Within six weeks the United Kingdom had lost four fifths of its
total tonnage. John Bull was given another moment in history to
display his famous doggedness. His Majesty's Government refused to
negotiate with the newts and did not call off its ban on giving them
any supplies. "An Englishman," declared the prime minister on behalf
of the entire nation, "will protect animals but will not haggle with
them." Just a few weeks later there was a desperate shortage of
foodstuffs in the British Isles. The last few scraps of bread and
last few spoonfuls of tea or milk were reserved for the children to
consume each day; the British nation bore it with exemplary dignity,
despite having sunk so low that they had even eaten all their
racehorses. The Prince of Wales dug the first furrow in the greens
of the Royal Golf Club with his own hand so that carrots could be
grown there for the orphans in London. Wimbledon tennis courts were
turned over to the cultivation of potatoes, and wheat was sown over
the race course at Ascot. "We can endure the greatest of sacrifices,
" the leader of the Conservative Party declared in parliament, "but
British honour is something we will never give up."</p>

<p>The blockade of British coasts was total, and so England was left
with only one way of obtaining supplies and maintaining
communications, and that was by air. "We need a hundred thousand
aircraft," the minister for aviation declared, and all forces were
applied to fulfilling this edict; but then the governments of other
European powers raised bitter protests that this would disturb the
balance of power in the skies; the government of the United Kingdom
would have to abandon its plans and promise never to build more than
twenty thousand aircraft and even that not within the next five
years. They would simply have to remain hungry or pay horrifying
prices for foodstuffs supplied by the aircraft of other states; a
loaf of bread cost ten shillings, a rat sausage one guinea, a box of
caviar twenty-five pounds sterling. This was simply a golden age for
business, industry and agriculture on the continent. All military
shipping had been removed at the very start of hostilities, and so
the war against the newts had to be carried out on dry land and from
the air. Armies fired into the water with their cannons and machine
guns but without, it seemed, doing the newts any serious harm;
although the bombs dropped into the sea from aircraft seemed somewhat
more successful. The newts responded by firing on British ports from
their underwater cannons, reducing them to piles of rubble. They
even fired on London from the Thames Estuary; then the chiefs of
staff tried to attack the salamanders with harmful bacteria,
petroleum and acid poured into the Thames and several other bays and
estuaries. The newts responded by releasing a cloak of poisonous gas
over a hundred miles of British coastline. It was no more than a
demonstration, but it was enough; for the first time in history the
British government was forced to call on foreign powers to intervene
on its behalf, citing the ban on the use of poisonous gas in
warfare.</p>

<p>That night, the rasping, angry and heavy voice of Chief Salamander
was heard once again on the airwaves: "Hello you people! England
must stop its foolishness! If you poison our water we will poison
your air. We use no more than your own weapons. We are not
barbarians. We have no wish to wage war with people. All we wish is
to be allowed to live. We offer you peace. You will supply us with
your products and sell us your land. We are willing to pay you
well. We offer you more than peace. We offer you trade. We offer
you gold for your land. Hello, calling the government of Great
Britain. Tell me your price for the southern part of Lincolnshire
around The Wash. You have three days to consider the matter. For
this period I will suspend all hostilities apart from the
blockades."</p>

<p>At that moment the rumbling of underwater cannons off the coasts
of England ceased. The land cannons were also silent. There was a
strange, almost eerie quiet. The British government declared in
parliament that it had no intention of negotiating with animals. The
residents of south Lincolnshire were warned that there was clear
danger of a major attack by the newts and that they should evacuate
coastal areas and move inland; the trains, cars and buses provided,
however, carried only children and some women. All the men remained
where they were; it simply did not enter their heads that an
Englishman might lose the land he lives on. One minute after the
three-day truce had expired the shooting began; these were shots from
English cannons fired by the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment to the
sound of the regimental march, The Red Rose. There was then the
thunder of an enormous explosion. The mouth of the River Nene was
flooded up as far as Wisbech and the whole of the area around The
Wash was inundated by the sea. A number of notable sites collapsed
into the water, including the famous Wisbech Abbey, Holland Castle
and the George and Dragon.</p>

<p>The following day the British government answered questions in
parliament: all military measures for the protection of British
coasts had been taken; the possibility of further and much more
extensive attacks on British soil could not be excluded; that His
Majesty's Government was nonetheless unable to negotiate with an
enemy which was unwilling even to spare civilians and women.
(Agreement) This was a time that would not merely determine the fate
of England, but of the entire civilised world. The United Kingdom
would be willing to enter into international agreements which would
limit these terrible and barbaric attacks which threaten the future
of mankind itself.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, the nations of the world met together in
Vaduz.</p>

<p>The conference took place in Vaduz because in the height of the
Alps there was no danger from the newts and because most of the
world's most powerful and socially important people had already fled
there from coastal areas. It was generally agreed that the
conference progressed quickly to reach solutions to all the worlds'
current problems. Every country (with the exceptions of Switzerland,
Afghanistan, Bolivia and some other land-locked countries) agreed
emphatically not to recognise the newts as an independent military
power, mainly because they would then have to acknowledge their own
newts as members of a salamander state; it was even possible that a
salamander state of this sort would want to exercise its sovereignty
over all the shores and waters occupied by newts. For this reason it
was legally and practically impossible to declare war against the
newts or put any other sort of international pressure on them; each
state would have the right to take measures only against its own
newts; it would be a purely internal matter. This meant that it was
impossible to speak of any collective diplomatic or military campaign
against the newts. Any state that came under attack from the
salamanders could receive international aid only in the form of
overseas loans for them to help defend themselves.</p>

<p>At this, England put forward the proposal that every state should
at least bind itself to stop supplying the newts with weapons or
explosives. After full consideration the proposal was turned down,
mainly because those obligations were already contained in the London
Convention; secondly because it would not be possible to prevent any
state from providing its newts with equipment and weaponry to defend
its own shores "according to its needs"; and thirdly, seafaring
nations would "understandably wish to maintain good relations with
residents of the sea", so that it was deemed appropriate "not to be
precipitate in taking any measure that the newts might feel to be
repressive"; every state was nonetheless willing to promise to supply
weaponry and explosives to any state under attack from the newts.</p>

<p>A suggestion put forward by the Colombian delegates in private
session, that at least unofficial negotiations with the newts should
take place, was accepted. Chief Salamander was to be invited to send
his representatives to the conference. Great Britain protested
loudly at this and refused outright to sit at the same table with the
newts; but in the end the British delegation had to be content to
depart, temporarily, to Engadin, for reasons of health. That night,
all seafaring powers sent out an invitation to His Excellency Chief
Salamander to name his representatives and send them to Vaduz. The
answer was a rasping "Yes; this time we will come to meet you; next
time we will expect your delegates to come into the water to meet
me." The official announcement followed: "The accredited newt
representatives will arrive in two days time at Buchs station by the
Orient Express."</p>

<p>Every preparation for the arrival of the newts was made with all
haste; the most luxurious bathrooms in the city were prepared for
them and a special train was chartered to bring cisterns of sea water
for the newt delegates to bathe in. The reception for them that
evening at the railway station in Vaduz had been meant to be
unofficial, but it was still attended by many of the delegates'
secretaries, representatives of government offices and around two
hundred journalists, photographers and film makers. At exactly
twenty-five minutes past six the Orient Express arrived at the
station and came to a halt beside the red carpet. From the saloon
car emerged three tall and elegant gentlemen with a number of
sophisticated-looking secretaries carrying heavy briefcases. "Where
are the newts, then?" somebody muttered. Two or three officials went
forward uncertainly to meet the three gentlemen; but the first of the
gentlemen had already begun, quickly and quietly, to say, "We are the
newt delegation. I'm Professor van Dott from The Hague.
Ma&Atilde;&reg;tre Rosso Castelli, avocat de Paris. Doctor Manoel
Carvalho, avocado of Lisbon." The officials bowed and introduced
themselves.</p>

<p>"So you are not newts, then," the French secretary said with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"Of course we are not newts," said Dr. Castelli. We are their
lawyers. Excuse me, but I think these gentlemen might want to take
some photographs." And then the photographers and newsreel makers
took a great many pictures of the smiling newt delegation. The
secretaries of the legatees already present also showed their
pleasure. It was, after all, only reasonable and proper that the
newts should send human beings to represent them. Human beings were
easier to deal with. And most of all, it would avoid certain social
unpleasantnesses. The first discussions with the newts' delegates
took place that same night, addressing the question of how to renew
peace with the United Kingdom as soon as possible. Professor van
Dott asserted that there was no question that the newts had come
under attack from Great Britain; the British gunboat, Erebus, had
fired on the newts radio ship on the open sea; the British admiralty
had broken peaceful trading with the newts by preventing the
Amenhotep from unloading the cargo of explosives they had ordered;
thirdly, the British government had instigated a blockade against the
newts by its ban on their receiving any supplies of any sort. The
newts were unable to make a complaint about these hostile acts either
at The Hague, because the London Convention denied them the right to
make any complaint, or in Geneva, because the newts were not a member
of the United Nations; they were therefore left with no alternative
but to defend themselves. Chief Salamander was nonetheless willing
to end hostilities under, of course, the following conditions: 1. The
United Kingdom was to apologise for the offences cited above; 2. All
restrictions on supplies to the newts were to be lifted; 3. As
compensation, the newts were to be ceded the lowland areas of the
Punjab where they would create new bays and shorelines. The chairman
of the conference stated that he would pass these conditions on to
his honourable friend, the representative of the United Kingdom, who
was currently unable to attend; however he made no secret of his fear
that Britain would find these conditions difficult to accept; but we
could all hope that they might be the starting point for further
negotiations.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda was the complaint by France about the newts
having caused explosions on the coast of Sengambia, thus interfering
in a French colonial dependency. This was answered by the famous
Parisian lawyer, Dr. Julien Rosso Castelli. "Prove it!" he said.
Seismographs around the world indicate that the earthquake in
Senegambia was of volcanic origin and was connected with volcanic
activity in Mount Pico on the island of Fogo. "Here in this
dossier," he declared as he slapped his hand against it, "are all the
scientific proofs you need. If, on the other hand, you have any
proof that the earthquake in Senegambia was caused by any activity of
my clients, then we await them with interest."</p>

<p>BELGIAN DELEGATE, CREUX: Your Chief Salamander declared himself
that it was done by the newts"</p>

<p>PROFESSOR VAN DOTT: His speech was not official.</p>

<p>M. ROSSO CASTELLI: We are authorised by our clients to deny the
contents of that speech. I request that expert witnesses be heard on
whether the technology is available to create a fissure in the Earths
crust sixty-seven kilometres long. I suggest they should try the
experiment of creating such a fissure. Unless, gentlemen, you have
proof of the opposite, then we will be forced to talk of volcanic
activity. Nevertheless, the bay created in Senegambia would be
suitable for settlement by a population of newts and Chief Salamander
is willing to purchase it from the government of France. We are
authorised by our clients to negotiate a price.</p>

<p>FRENCH DELEGATE, MINISTER DEVAL: If this is understood to be an
offer of compensation for the damage caused, then we are willing to
discuss the matter.</p>

<p>M. ROSSO CASTELLI: Very well. Although the newt government does
request that the contract of purchase cover also the territory of the
Landes, extending from the mouth of the Gironde as far as Bayonne, an
area covering six thousand seven hundred square kilometres. In other
words, the newt government is willing to buy this piece of land in
southern France.</p>

<p>MINISTER DEVAL (native of Bayonne, member of parliament for
Bayonne): So that these salamanders of yours turn part of France into
seabed? Never! Never!</p>

<p>DR. ROSSO CASTELLI: France will come to regret these words of
yours, monsieur. Today we have still been talking of purchase.</p>

<p>At this, the session was brought to an end.</p>

<p>The subject of the next meeting was a substantial international
offer made to the newts: to cause damage to established and densely
populated was unacceptable, but they would be able to build new
shores and islands for themselves; in which case they could be
assured of substantial loans to cover the costs; the new lands and
island would then be recognised as their independent and sovereign
territory.</p>

<p>DR. MANOEL CARVALHO, renowned lawyer from Lisbon, offered his
thanks for this proposal which he would convey to the newts; but any
child could understand, he said, that building new land would take
much longer and cost far more than demolishing old land. Our clients
are in need of new bays and shorelines as soon as possible; it is for
them a matter of life and death. It would be better for mankind to
accept Chief Salamander's generous offer of buying the world from the
human beings instead of taking it by force. Our clients have found a
way of extracting the gold contained in seawater; so that they have
almost unlimited means; they would be able to pay for your world very
well, very well indeed. You would do well to bear in mind that, from
their point of view, the price of the world will become lower with
time, especially if--as might well be expected--any further
volcanic or tectonic disasters take place which might well be far
larger than anything we have been witness to so far, and these might
well substantially reduce the size of the continents. Today you
still have the opportunity to sell the world while it is still its
present size; when there is nothing left above water but the ruins of
a few mountains no-one will want to pay you a penny for it. I am
here as representative and legal advisor for the newts, and it is my
duty to defend their interests; but I am also a human being just like
yourselves, gentlemen, and the well-being of mankind is just as close
to my heart as it is to yours. This is why I advise you, indeed I
implore you: Sell the continents before it is too late! You can sell
them as a whole or sell them country by country. Everyone now is
aware of Chief Salamander's generosity and modernity; he gives his
assurance that in the course of these unavoidable changes to be made
to the surface of the Earth everything possible will be done to
protect human life; the continents will be flooded in stages and in a
way that will avoid any panic or unnecessary catastrophe. We have
been authorised to negotiate either with the this illustrious world
conference as a whole or with individual states. The presence of
such outstanding lawyers such as Professor van Dott and
Ma&Atilde;&reg;tre Julien Rosso Castelli is your assurance that we
are concerned not only to defend the legitimate interests of our
clients but will also co-operate closely with yourselves to protect
those things that are dearest to us all; human culture and the good
of all mankind.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the conference had become somewhat tense when
another proposal was put forward: that the salamander should be
allowed to flood and occupy central China; in return for which the
newts would bind themselves in perpetuity to stay away from the
shores of Europe and its population.</p>

<p>DR. ROSSO CASTELLI: In perpetuity, that is rather a long time.
Let us say for a period of twenty years.</p>

<p>PROFESSOR VAN DOTT: Central China is not a very large area. Let
us say the provinces of Nganhuei, Honan, Kiangsu, Chi-li and
Fung-tien.</p>

<p>The Japanese representative protested at the ceding of Fung-tien
which lay in the Japanese sphere of interest. The Chinese delegate
said something, but nobody, unfortunately, was able to understand
him. There was an air of growing anxiety in the negotiating chamber;
it was already one o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Just then the secretary to the Italian delegation came into the
room and whispered something into the ear of the Italian
representative, Count Tosti. The count turned pale, stood up, and
although the Chinese delegate, Dr. Ti, was still speaking, he called
out hoarsely: "Mister Chairman, may I say something. Reports have
just come through that the newts have flooded part of the region of
Venice near Portogruaro."</p>

<p>There was a chill silence, broken only by the Chinese delegate who
was still speaking.</p>

<p>"Chief Salamander did warn you of this long ago," grumbled Dr.
Carvalho.</p>

<p>Professor van Dott turned impatiently and raised his hand.
"Mister Chairman, may we return to the subject at hand. We were
discussing the province of Fung-tien. We have been authorised to
offer the Japanese government compensation for it in the form of
gold. The question following on from that is what our clients would
receive from the states concerned for the task of evacuating
China."</p>



<p>At that moment, radio hams were listening to the newts broadcast.
"You have just been listening to the barcarolle from The Tales of
Hoffmann on gramophone records," the announcer rasped. "Hello,
hello, we are now transferring you to Venice."</p>

<p>And then, all that could be heard was a black and fathomless
soughing, like the sound of rising water.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<h4>MR. POVONDRA BLAMES HIMSELF</h4>

<p>Who would have thought so much time had flowed by? Our Mr.
Povondra isn't even the doorman any more at G.H. Bondy's house; now,
you might say, he is a venerable old man who can enjoy the fruits of
his old and industrious life in peace as a pensioner; although his
pension doesn't go very far these times of high wartime prices! He
still goes out now and then to do some fishing; sitting in his boat
with his fishing rod and watching how the water flows by day after
day and all the things that go by with it! Sometimes he hooks a
dace, sometimes a bass; there seem to be more of them nowadays, maybe
because all the rivers are so much shorter. Mind you, there's
nothing wrong with a nice bass; It's a bit boney sometimes, but the
flesh is nice, tastes a bit like almonds. And mother knows just how
to cook it. What Mr. Povondra doesn't know, though, is that mother
usually uses those newspaper cuttings that he used to collect and
arrange for the fire to cook the bass. He didn't keep up his
collection, though, not went he started taking his pension; he got
himself an fish tank instead where he keeps some goldfish; and he
keeps some little newts in there too; sits there for hours, he does,
watching them as they lay in the water without moving, or climbing
out onto the little bank he made them with some gravel; then hell
turn round and say: "Who'd have thought it, mother?" But you've got
to do more than just sit there and watch, that's why Mr. Povondra
took up keeping fish. Keep yourself busy, you've always got to keep
yourself busy, thought Mother Povondra contentedly. Better than if
he went out drinking or got involved in politics.</p>

<p>A lot of water, truly a lot of water had flowed under the bridges
on the Vltava. Even little Frank isn't at school learning about
geography any more, he's not even a young man tearing his socks as he
rushes after the silly things young men rush after. He's getting
older himself, young Frank; he's got himself a good job at the post
office, he has, so it's turned out quite useful that he did learn all
that geography. He's starting to get a bit of sense too, thought Mr.
Povondra as he guided his boat out onto the water by one of the
bridges. Hell be coming round, today; it's Sunday and he won't be
working. I'll take him out in the boat and we can go upstream up to
the tip of St&Aring;&trade;eleck&Atilde;&frac12; Island; the fish
bite better up there; and Frank can tell me all about what's in the
papers. Then we can go back home to his wife and the two nippers--
it wasn't long since Mr. Povondra had relaxed into the quiet joy of
being a grandfather. Mind you, it was already a year now since
little Marie had started school, she likes school; and there was
little Frank, his grandson, nearly weighs five stone already, he
does. Mr. Povondra had a strong and deep feeling that everything was
right with the world.</p>

<p>But there was Frank waiting on the bank waving to him, and Mr.
Povondra rowed over. "Glad you've come, mind you it's no more than
you should do," he added. "Mind you don't fall in the water
now."</p>

<p>"Are they biting?" his son asked.</p>

<p>"Not really," the old man grumbled. "Lets go upstream a bit,
shall we?"</p>

<p>It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon; still not time when those
madmen and layabouts all come out from their football matches or
whatever else they do. Prague was empty and quiet; the few people
who wandered along the sides of the river and over the bridges
weren't in any hurry as they ambled along decently and with dignity.
They were decent reasonable people, not like those crowds who gather
and laugh at the fishermen on the Vltava. Once again, Father
Povondra had that nice deep feeling that all was well with the
world.</p>

<p>"What's in the papers then, Son?" he asked with the curtness of a
father.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, Dad," his son answered. "I saw that those newts
have got up as far as Dresden, though."</p>

<p>"Germanys had it then," Mr. Povondra asserted. "They're funny
people you know, those Germans. They're well educated, but they're
funny. I knew a German once, chauffeur he was for some factory; and
he wasn't half coarse, this German. Mind you, he kept the car in
good condition, I'll say that for him. And now look, Germanys
disappearing from the map of the world," Mr. Povondra ruminated.
"And all that fuss they used to make! Terrible, it was: everything
for the army and everything for the soldiers. But not even they were
any match for these newts. And I know about these newts, you know
that, don't you. Remember when I took you out to show you one of
them when you were only so high?"</p>

<p>"Watch out, Dad," said his son, "you've got a bite."</p>

<p>"That's only a tiddler," the old man grumbled as he twitched on
his rod. Even Germany now, he thought to himself. No-one even bats
an eyelid at it these days. What a song and dance they used to make
at first whenever these newts flooded anywhere! Even if it was only
Mesopotamia or China, the papers were full of it. Not like that now,
Mr. Povondra contemplated sadly, staring out at his rod. You get
used to anything, I suppose. At least they're not here, though; but
I wish the prices weren't so high! Think what they charge for coffee
these days! I suppose that's what you have to expect if they go and
flood Brazil. If part of the world disappears underwater it has its
effect in the shops.</p>

<p>The float on Mr. Povondra's line danced about on the ripples of
the water. How much of the world is it they've flooded so far then?,
the old man considered. There's Egypt and India and China--they've
even gone into Russia; and that was a big country, that was, Russia!
When you think, all the way up from the Black Sea as far the Arctic
Circle--all water! You can't say they haven't taken a lot of our
land from us! And their only going slowly...</p>

<p>"Up as far as Dresden then, you say?" the old man spoke up.</p>

<p>"Ten miles short of Dresden. That means almost the whole of
Saxony will soon be under water."</p>

<p>"I went there once with Mr. Bondy," Father Povondra told him.
"Ever so rich, they were there, Frank. The food wasn't much good
though. Nice people, though. Much better than the Prussians. No
comparison."</p>

<p>"Prussia's gone now as well, though."</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised," the old man said regretfully. "I don't like
those Prussians. It's good for the French, though, if Germanys in
trouble. Give them a chance for some peace, now."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Dad," Frank objected. "They were saying in the
papers not long ago how a good third of France is under water now."
Mr. Povondra sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"There was a Frenchman working for us at Mr. Bondy's, a servant,
Jean his name was. And he was a one for the ladies, ruddy disgrace
it was. See, it always comes back to you if you're not responsible,
like that."</p>

<p>"But they say the newts are within ten miles of Paris," his son,
Frank, told him. "They had tunnels everywhere and then blew the
whole place up. They slaughtered two army divisions, they say."</p>

<p>"They make good soldiers, the French," said Mr. Povondra with the
air of an expert. "That Jean never used to put up with anything
either. I don't what made him like that. Smelt just like a perfume
shop, but if he got into a fight he really would fight. But two
divisions in the newts' army--that's not much really. When you
think about it," the old man considered, "people were better off when
they were fighting with other people. And it didn't take them all
this time either. It's twenty years it's been going on with the
newts, now, and still nothing's happened, they're still making
preparations for getting the best positions. But when I think of
when I was a young man, now those were battles! Three million people
there were on one side and three million on the other," and the old
man gesticulated and made the boat rock, "and then it was a Hell of a
battle when they got together--but they can't even get themselves a
proper war these days. They've always got the same concrete
embankments up and never even come together with bayonets. Not a bit
of it!"</p>

<p>"But newts and people can't go into battle like that, Dad," said
Povondra junior in defence of the modern style of warfare. "You
just can't make a bayonet charge underwater."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," grumbled Mr. Povondra with contempt. "They
just can't get together properly. But put an army of people against
an army of people, and then you'll see what they can do. And what do
you know about war, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I just hope they don't come here," said Frank, rather
unexpectedly. "When you've got kids, you know..."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, come here," asked the startled Mr. Povondra
senior. "What, here, all the way to Prague, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Not just Prague, anywhere in the country," the worried Povondra
junior replied. "If the newts have already got as far as Dresden
then I think..."</p>

<p>"You think too much, you do," Mr. Povondra reprimanded him. "How
would they get here? What, across all these mountains surrounding
the country?"</p>

<p>"They could come up the Elbe and from there up into the
Vltava."</p>

<p>At this idea, Father Povondra snorted in disgust. "Don't talk
rubbish! Up the Elbe? They might get some of the way up but not all
the way. It's all rocks and mountains in the way. I've been there,
I've seen them. Not a bit of it, the newts won't get here, well be
alright. And Switzerland too, they'll be alright too. It's cause we
haven't got any coastline, see, big advantage that is. It's if your
country borders on the sea, that's when your in trouble."</p>

<p>"But there's sea now as close as Dresden..."</p>

<p>"That's Germany, that is," the old man retorted. "That's their
business. But the newts can't get as far as us, it stands to
reason. They'd have to get all the mountains out the way first; and
I don't think you've got much idea how much work that'd be!"</p>

<p>"Well that's nothing for them," young Mr. Povondra objected
gloomily. "They do that sort of thing all the time! Think of
Guatemala; they flooded a whole range of mountains there."</p>

<p>"Down there it's different," said the old man confidently. "Don't
talk such rubbish, Frank! That was down in Guatemala, not here in
Europe. Things are different here." Young Mr. Povondra sighed.</p>

<p>"As you say, Dad. But when you think that those horrors have
already flooded about a fifth of all the land..."</p>

<p>"Only where it's next to the sea, you daft ha'p'orth, not anywhere
else. You just don't understand about politics. It's those
countries that are next to the sea, they're the ones that have been
at war with the newts, not us. Were neutral, we are, and that's why
they can't do anything against us. That's just how it is. And now
keep quiet for a bit, else we won't catch anything."</p>

<p>Over the water was peace and quiet. The trees on
St&Aring;&trade;eleck&Atilde;&frac12; Island already cast long and
delicate shadows on the surface of the Vltava. Trams jangled over
the bridge, nannies pushing prams ambled along the banks, the people
out on this Sunday afternoon were gay and friendly...</p>

<p>"Dad?" exclaimed young Povondra, almost like a child.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Is that a catfish there?"</p>

<p>"Where?" Out of the river, just by the National Theatre, there
protruded a large black head moving slowly upstream.</p>

<p>"Is that a catfish," Povondra junior said again. The old man put
down his fishing rod.</p>

<p>"That there?" he exclaimed, pointing at it with a shaking finger.
"That?" The black head disappeared under the water. "That wasn't a
catfish, Frank," explained the old man in a voice that hardly seemed
his own. "We might as well go home, now. We've all had it."</p>

<p>"Had what?"</p>

<p>"A newt. That was a newt, they're here. Lets go home," he
repeated as he fumbled to put his rod away. "We've all had it."</p>

<p>"You're shaking," said Frank anxiously. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Lets just go home," the old man stuttered crossly as his chin
quivered. "I'm cold. I'm cold. That's all we needed! We've had
it. They're here now. Oh Christ it's cold! I want to go home."</p>

<p>Young Mr. Povondra glanced at him quizzically and took hold of the
oars. "I'll take there you, Dad," he said in a worried voice and
drove the boat to the island with a few strong strokes of the oars.
"Just leave it, I'll tie the boat up."</p>

<p>"Whys it so cold?" the old man wondered as his teeth
chattered.</p>

<p>"I'll keep hold of you, Dad. Just come with me," he urged as he
took him by the arm. "I think you must have caught a cold on the
water. It was just a piece of wood, that's all." The old man was
shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Piece of wood? Don't give me that! I know what I saw! It was a
newt! Let go of me!" Mr. Povondra junior did something he had never
done in his life before; he hailed a taxi and pushed his father in as
he told the driver where to go.</p>

<p>"I'll take you, Dad, it's getting late."</p>

<p>"It's already too late," his father raved. "It's much too late.
We've all had it, Frank. That wasn't a piece of wood. That was
them!" When they got home, young Mr. Povondra almost had to carry
his father up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Get the bed ready, Mum," he whispered quickly at the door.
"We've got to put Dad to bed, he's been taken ill all of a
sudden."</p>

<p>So there was Father Povondra lying under the bedclothes; his nose
peeking strangely out from his face and his lips murmuring and
mumbling something that could not be understood; how old he looked,
how old! Then he became a little calmer...</p>

<p>"Are you feeling better now, Dad?" At the foot of the bed was
Mother Povondra, her hand to her mouth and weeping into her apron;
their daughter in law was tending the stove and the children, Frank
and Marie, gazed wide-eyed at their grandfather as if they hardly
knew him. "Are you sure you don't want a doctor, Dad?" Father
Povondra looked at the children and whispered something; then his
eyes suddenly filled with tears. "Is there anything you need,
Dad?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes there is something," the old man whispered. "Something
you ought to know. It's all my fault. If only I'd never let that
sea captain in to see Mr. Bondy, if I'd never let him in, all this
would never have happened..."</p>

<p>"It's alright, nothing's happened, Dad," young Povondra tried to
soothe him.</p>

<p>"You don't understand these things," the old man gasped. "We've
all had it, don't you see that? It's the end of the world. It's
going to be all sea even here, even here now that the newts are
here. And it's all my fault; I should never have let that sea
captain in to see Mr. Bondy. Everyone ought to know, they ought to
know whose fault it all is."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," his son replied sharply. "You shouldn't be thinking
like this, Dad. It's everyone's fault. It's governments' fault,
it's big business's fault. Everyone wanted to have all the newts
they could get. We all wanted to get as much out of the newts as we
could. That's why we sent them all those weapons and all that--it's
all our faults."</p>

<p>Mr. Povondra looked up crossly. "It always used to be nothing but
sea, and that's how it's going to be again. It's the end of the
world. Somebody told me once that even Prague was seabed once. I
think it must have been the newts that did it then as well. I should
never have let that sea captain in to see Mr. Bondy. There was
something that kept telling me, don't do it, and then I thought to
myself, perhaps I'll get a tip from this sea captain. And then, he
never did. That's how you destroy the whole world you see, all for
nothing..." The old man gulped back something like a tear. "I
know, I know full well, we've all had it. It's the end of the world,
and it's all my fault..."</p>

<p>"Grandfather, wouldn't you like to have some tea?" asked the young
Mrs. Povondra sympathetically.</p>

<p>"All I want," the old man sighed, "all I want is for these
children to forgive me."</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<h4>THE AUTHOR TALKS TO HIMSELF</h4>

<p>"Well you can't just leave it like that, can you!" the authors
internal voice declared.</p>

<p>Well, why not? asked the author, rather unsure of himself.</p>

<p>"You mean you're going to let Mr. Povondra die like that?"</p>

<p>Well I don't want to do it like that but, well, Mr. Povondra's an
old man after all, he must be well over seventy...</p>

<p>"And you're going to leave him to die in a state of mental torture
like that? Can't you even say something like But Grandad, it's not
as bad as all that, the newts won't destroy the world, mankind will
save itself, just you wait and see? Surely there's something you can
do for him!"</p>

<p>I suppose I could get a doctor for him, the author suggested.
Suppose the old man has had an attack of nerves; or at that age he
could have had a lung inflammation, which, thanks be to God, he
survives; and he could still sit little Marie on his knee and ask
what she's been learning in school. All the joys of old age, I could
let the old man have all the joys of old age.</p>

<p>"Fine sort of joys of old age that is," the internal voice
sneered. "Hell hug the child with his ancient hands and all the time
hell be thinking--thinking with horror--that one day shell be
fleeing from the rush of water inexorably flooding the whole world;
hell wrinkle his bushy brow and whisper in a voice of dread: That's
what I did, Marie, that's what I did. Listen, do you really want to
have the whole of mankind destroyed?"</p>

<p>The author frowned. Don't ask me what I want. Do you think I
wanted to see the continents where people live reduced to rubble, do
you think I wanted it to end like this? That was just the logical
course of events; what could I have done to stop that? I did
everything I could; I gave people enough warning; what about that X,
that was partly me. I warned them, don't give the newts weapons and
explosives, stop this vile trading in salamanders, and so on--and
you saw how it all turned out. They all had a thousand good economic
and political reasons why they couldn't stop. I'm not a politician
or a businessman; how am I supposed to persuade them about these
things. What are we supposed to do; quite likely the world will
collapse and disappear under water; but at least that will happen for
political and economic reasons we can all understand, at least it
will happen with the help of science technology and public opinion,
with human ingenuity of all sorts! Not some cosmic catastrophe but
just the same old reasons to do with the struggle for power and money
and so on. There's nothing we can do about that.</p>

<p>The internal voice was quiet for a while. "And don't you feel
sorry for mankind?"</p>

<p>Hold on, not so fast! Nobody's saying the whole of mankind has
to be destroyed. All the newts want is more shoreline where they can
live and lay their eggs. Maybe what they'll do is turn the
continents into lots of long strings so that there's as much
shoreline as possible. What if there are still some people surviving
on these strips of land? And there they can work metal and other
things for the salamanders. As the newts can't work with fire
themselves, can they.</p>

<p>"So mankind will be put into the service of the newts."</p>

<p>Yes, if that's what you want to call it. They'll simply be
working in factories like they do now. They'll just have different
masters, that's all. So that means it might not be so different
after all...</p>

<p>"And don't you feel sorry for mankind?"</p>

<p>Oh, just leave me alone, for Gods sake! What am I supposed to do
about it? It is what the people wanted, don't forget; they all
wanted to have newts, they wanted commerce, industry and technology;
civil authorities and military authorities, they all wanted it; even
Povondra junior said so: it's all of our faults. How do you think I
could not feel sorry for mankind, anyway? And most of all, I felt
sorry for them when I saw how, of their own free will and whatever
the cost, how they were hurtling to their own perdition. It'd be
enough to make anyone scream. He'd shout and raise his hands as if
he'd seen a train going down the wrong track. And now it can't be
stopped. The newts are going to keep on multiplying on and on and on
and they'll go on demolishing the old continents on and on. Think
what it was that Wolf Meynert said about the newts: that people
would have to make way for them; and it would only be the salamanders
that would create a world that was happy, unified and uniform...</p>

<p>"Oh come on, now! Wolf Meynert? Wolf Meynert was an intellectual.
Did you think up something so vile and murderous and nonsensical,
that no intelectual would want to use it to save the world? Never mind,
leave it. What do you think Marie might be doing now?"</p>

<p>Marie? I suppose she's out playing somewhere. Don't make a noise, they
told her, Grandad's asleep. But she doesn't know what to do and she is
bored.</p>

<p>"And what's she actually doing?"</p>

<p>Don't know. Maybe she's trying to touch her nose with the tip of
her tongue.</p>

<p>"There, you see? And you'd let something like a new Great Flood
come along."</p>

<p>Just stop it, will you. I can't work miracles. What has to
happen will happen! Things run along their inevitable course. And
even that's reassuring in its way: that everything that happens has
its own necessity and follows certain rules.</p>

<p>"Couldn't the newts be stopped in some way?"</p>

<p>No. There are too many of them. They've got to have room to live
in.</p>

<p>"What about if they all died out in some way? Something like some
kind of epidemic or degeneration..."</p>

<p>No, that's too cheap and easy. Why should nature have to put
right what's been done by man? See?--not even you think they could
do anything to save themselves now. You basically think something
will come along from somewhere else. I'll tell you something: do you
know who it is that still--even now when a fifth of Europe is
already underwater--is still providing the newts with explosives and
torpedoes and drills? Do you know who it is that's working
feverishly in all the laboratories, trying to find even more
effective machines and materials for sweeping the world out of
existence? Do you know who it is who's lending the newts money, who
it is who's financing the end of the world, this new Flood?</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. All the factories. All the banks. All the
countries in the world."</p>

<p>Well then! If it was just newts against people it might be
possible to do something; but when it's people against people then
there's no way of stopping it, is there.</p>

<p>"Hold on, people against people! I've just thought of something.
What if it was newts against newts?"</p>

<p>Newts against newts. How do you mean?</p>

<p>"Well what if for instance...if there are too many newts they
might start squabbling about some tiny stretch of coast or some bay
or something; then they can start fighting about bigger and bigger
lengths of coast until they get into a big struggle about all the
coastlines in the world, eh? Newts against newts! How's that,
wouldn't that follow the natural course of events?"</p>

<p>Er, no, that wouldn't work. You can't have newts fighting with
newts. That wouldn't be natural. The newts are just one
species.</p>

<p>"Well people are just one species too, aren't they. And it's
never stopped them fighting with each other; all the same species and
think of all the excuses for war they've used! It hasn't had to be
about space to live in, it's been about power, prestige, influence,
fame, resources and I don't know what else! Why couldn't the newts
start fighting among themselves about something like prestige?"</p>

<p>Why would they do that? What do you think they'd get out of
it?</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that some of them would get more coast to live on
for a short time and a bit more power than the others. And then
after a while it'd be the other way round."</p>

<p>And why would some have more power than the others? They're all
the same, after all, they're all newts; they've all got the same
skeleton, they're all as ugly as each other and all as mediocre as
each other. What would make them start killing each other? Just
tell me what you think it is that they might start fighting
over.</p>

<p>"Just leave them to it and they'll soon find something. If
there's one group living on the western shore and another on the
eastern, they'll probably start to despise each other in the name of
West against East. And, here you've got the European salamanders
while down there there are the African; it'd be strange if one lot
didn't want to be better than the others! So they can go and teach
the others a lesson in the name of civilisation, or expansionism or I
don't know what: they're bound to think of some kind of ideal or
political reason which means that newts on one shore will have to go
and beat up the newts on the other shore. The salamanders are as
civilised as we are, don't forget; they won't be short of arguments
to do with power or commercial interests or legal rights or culture
of some such."</p>

<p>And they've got plenty of weapons. Don't forget they're
fantastically well armed.</p>

<p>"Yep, they've got plenty of weapons. And they could learn how it
is that history's made from the example given by people, couldn't
they!"</p>

<p>Hold on a sec., hold on. (The author jumps up and starts to pace
excitedly around his study.) You're right, it would be strange if
they didn't do it! I can see it now. You only need to look at the
map of the world--where's that map, I've got one here somewhere,
where is it?</p>

<p>"There it is."</p>

<p>Right. So here's the Atlantic, there's the Mediterranean, the
North Sea. Europe here, America there--so this here is the cradle
of culture and modern civilisation. And somewhere there is the
sunken city of Atlantis...</p>

<p>"And now that's where the newts are flooding Atlantis all over
again."</p>

<p>That's it. And here is...the Pacific, the Indian Ocean. The
ancient and mysterious Orient. The cradle of civilisation, as they
say. And somewhere here, somewhere to the east of Africa, is the
mythical island of Lemuria that was flooded. Sumatra, and a bit to
the east of Sumatra...</p>

<p>"The little island of Tana Masa. The cradle of the newts."</p>

<p>Exactly. And that's where King Salamander, the spiritual leader
of all the newts, has his court. Captain van Toch's tapa-boys still
live there, the original newts in the Pacific, and still half wild.
So this is their Orient. The whole area is called Lemuria now, while
the other area, the civilised, Europeanised or Americanised area
where they use all the modern technology, that's Atlantis. So Chief
Salamander rules there as a dictator, the great conqueror, soldier
and inventor, the Genghis Khan of the newts and destroyer of dry
land. Now he will be a magnificent figure.</p>

<p>("...but, do you think he's really a newt?")</p>

<p>(...No. Chief Salamander is human. His real name is Andreas
Schultze, and he took part in the Great War as an NCO somewhere)</p>

<p>("So that's it!")</p>

<p>(Yes, that's it, now you've got it.) So there's Atlantis here,
Lemuria there. They form two different groups because of geography,
administration, cultural differences...</p>

<p>"...and national differences. Don't forget about national
differences. The Lemurian salamanders speak Pidgin English, whereas
the Atlantic ones speak Basic English."</p>

<p>Yes, alright. As time goes by, the Atlantic newts go through the
old Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean...</p>

<p>"Naturally, the classic way to the East."</p>

<p>Right. And at the same time, the Lemurian newts press on around
the Cape of Good Hope to the western coast of what had been Africa,
asserting that the whole of Africa is part of Lemuria.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>They use slogans such as, Lemuria for Lemurians, Out with the
Foreigners, and so on. A gulf of mistrust develops between Atlanta
and Lemuria and old enmities are revived. Their hatred becomes a
matter of life and death.</p>

<p>"Or else they develop into different nations."</p>

<p>Yes. The Atlantians despise the Lemurians and call them filthy
savages; the Lemurians have a fanatical hatred for the Atlantian
newts and see them as imperialists, western devils, and corruptors of
the ancient purity of newtdom. Chief Salamander forces the Lemurians
to grant concessions on their shores, supposedly in the interests of
trade and civilisation. King Salamander, the noble patriarch of the
Lemurians, has to grant these concessions against his will because
they have less weapons. Things flare up in the mouth of the Tigris,
not far from where Baghdad used to be: the native Lemurians attack
the Atlantian colonists, killing two of their officers, supposedly
because of some insult to their nation. And as a result of that
...</p>

<p>".. it leads to war. Naturally."</p>

<p>Yes, there's a world war of newts against newts.</p>

<p>"In the name of culture and decency."</p>

<p>And in the name of True Newtdom. In the name of Glory and
Greatness. Their slogan is, It's us or them! The Lemurians, armed
with Malay kukries and daggers cut down the Atlantian intruders
without mercy; but the Atlantian newts have been educated by
Europeans and are more advanced and release poisonous chemicals and
specially cultured bacteria into the Lemurian Sea and these weapons
are so effective they poison all the oceans of the world. The sea is
infected with artificially cultivated plague. And that's it. All
the newts die.</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>All of them. Down to the very last one. They'll become an
extinct species. All that'll be left of them will be the old fossil
of Andrias Scheuchzeri in &Atilde;&mdash;hningen.</p>

<p>"And what about the people?"</p>

<p>The people? Oh, yes, the people. Well, bit by bit they start to
come back down from the hills back down to the coasts of what's left
of the continents; but the ocean will still be full of the stench of
decomposing newts. The continents slowly grow back because of the
silt deposited by rivers; the sea is pushed back bit by bit, and
everything will be almost the same as it was before. There's a new
legend about a Great Flood sent by God to punish man for his sins.
And there will be new legends about lands that disappeared under the
water, and these lands will have been the cradle of human
civilisation; and there will myths and legends about places like
England and France and Germany...</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>...and then, I don't really know.</p>
