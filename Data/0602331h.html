<p class="first">AFTER leaving Saturn the Astronef pursued her
lonely course on her homeward voyage across the fields of space,
while the Ringed World, which had so nearly proved the end of
Lord and Lady Redgrave's wanderings, grew dimmer every hour
behind them.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day from Saturn Lord Redgrave
went as usual into the conning-tower to examine the instruments
and to see that everything was in order. To his intense surprise
he found, on looking at the gravitational compass, which was to
the Astronef what the ordinary compass is to a ship at sea, that
the vessel was a long way out of her course.</p>

<p>Such a thing had never yet occurred. Up to now the Astronef
had obeyed the laws of gravitation and repulsion with absolute
exactness. He made another examination of the instruments; but
no, all were in perfect order.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the deuce is the matter," he said, after he
had looked for a few moments with frowning eyes at the Heavens
before him. "By Jove, we're swinging more. This is getting
serious."</p>

<p>He went back to the compass. The long, slender needle was
slowly swinging farther and farther out of the middle line of
the vessel.</p>

<p>"There can only be two explanations of that," he went on,
thrusting his hands deep into his trouser pockets; "either the
engines are not working properly, or some enormous and invisible
body is pulling us towards it out of our course. Let's have a
look at the engines first."</p>

<p>When he reached the engine-room he said to Murgatroyd, who
was indulging in his usual pastime of cleaning and polishing his
beloved charges:</p>

<p>"Have you noticed anything wrong during the last hour or so,
Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord, at least not so far as concerns the engines.
They're all right. Hark now, they're not making more noise than
a lady's sewing machine," replied the old Yorkshireman with a
note of resentment in his voice. The suspicion that anything
could be wrong with his shining darlings was almost a personal
offence to him. "But is anything the matter, my lord, if I might
ask?"</p>

<p>"We're a long way off our course, and for the life of me I
can't understand it," replied Redgrave. "There's nothing about
here to pull us out of our line. Of course the stars&mdash;good
Lord, I never thought of that! Look here, Murgatroyd, not a word
abuut this to her ladyship. and stand by to raise the power by
degrees, as I signal to you."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord. I hope it's nothing bad."</p>

<p>Redgrave went back to the conning-tower without replying. The
only possible solution of the mystery of the deviation had
suddenly dawned upon him, and a very serious solution it was. He
remembered that there were such things as dead suns&mdash;the
derelicts of the Ocean of Space&mdash;vast, invisible orbs,
lightless and lifeless, too distant from any living sun to be
illumined by its rays, and yet exercising the only force left to
them, the force of attraction. Might not one of these have
wandered near enough to the confines of the Solar system to
exert this force, a force of absolutely unknown magnitude, upon
the Astronef?</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption"> He plunged into a maze of mathematics...</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>He went to a little desk beside the instrument-table and
plunged into a maze of mathematics, of masses and weights,
angles and distances. Half-an-hour later he stood looking at the
last symbol on the last sheet of paper with something like fear.
It was the fatal x which remained to satisfy the last equation,
the unknown quantity which represented the unseen force that was
dragging the Astronef into the outer wilderness of interstellar
space, into far-off regions from which, with the remaining
force at his disposal, no return would be possible.</p>

<p>He signalled to Murgatroyd to increase the development of the
R. Force from a tenth to a half. Then he went to the lower
saloon, where Zaidie was busy with her usual morning "tidy-up."
Now that the mystery was explained there was no reason to keep
her in the dark. Indeed, he had given her his word that he would
conceal from her no danger, however great, that might threaten
them when he had once assured himself of its existence.</p>

<p>She listened to him in silence and without a sign of fear
beyond a little lifting of the eyelids and a little fading of
the colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"And if we can't resist this force," she said, when he had
finished, "it will drag us millions&mdash;perhaps millions of
millions&mdash;of miles away from our own system into outer
space, and we shall either fall on the surface of this dead sun
and be reduced to a puff of lighted gas in an instant, or some
other body will pull us away from it, and then another away from
that, and so on, and we shall wander among the stars for ever
and ever until the end of time!"</p>

<p>"If the first happens, darling, we shall
die&mdash;together&mdash; without knowing it. It's the second
that I'm most afraid of. The Astronef may go on wandering among
the stars for ever&mdash;but we have only water enough for three
weeks more. Now come into the conning&mdash;tower and we'll sec
how things are going."</p>

<p>As they bent their heads over the instrument-table Redgrave
saw that the remorseless needle had moved two degrees more to
the right. The keel of the Astronef, under the impulse of the R.
Force, was continually turning. The pull of the invisible orb
was dragging the vessel slowly but irresistibly out of her
line.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for it but this," said Redgrave, putting out
his hand to the signal-board, and signalling to Murgatroyd to
put the engines to their highest power. "You see, dear, our
greatest danger is this; we have had to exert such a tremendous
lot of power that we haven't any too much to spare, and if we
have to spend it in counteracting the pull of this dead sun, or
whatever it is, we may not have enough of what I call the R.
Fluid left to get home with."</p>

<p>"I see," she said, staring with wide-open eyes at the needle.
"You mean that we may not have enough to keep us from falling
into one of the planets or perhaps into the sun itself. Well,
supposing the dangers are equal, this one is the nearest, and so
I guess we've got to fight it first."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a good American!" he said, putting his arm
across her shoulders and looking at once with infinite pride and
infinite regret at the calm, proud face which the glory of
resignation had adorned with a new beauty.</p>

<p>She bowed her head and then looked away again so that he
should not see that there were tears in her eyes. He took his
hand from her shoulder and stared in silence down at the needle.
It was stationary again.</p>

<p>"We've stopped!" he said, after a pause of several moments.
"Now, if the body that's taken us out of our course is moving
away from us we win, if it's coming towards us we lose. At any
rate, we've done all we can. Come along, Zaidie, let's go and
have a walk on deck."</p>

<p>They had scarcely reached the upper deck when something
happened which dwarfed all the other experiences of their
marvellous voyage into utter insignificance. Above and around
them the constellations blazed with a splendour inconceivable to
an observer on earth, but ahead of them gaped the vast, black
void which sailors call "the coal-hole," and in which the most
powerful telescopes have only discovered a few faintly luminous
bodies. Suddenly, out of the midst of this infinity of darkness,
there blazed a glare of almost intolerably brilliant radiance.
Instantly the forward end of the Astronef was bathed in light
and heat&mdash;the light and heat of a re-created sun, whose
elements had been dark and cold for uncounted ages.</p>

<p>Hundreds of tiny points of light, unknown worlds which had
been dark for myriads of years, twinkled out of the blackness.
Then the fierce glare grew dimmer. A vast mantle of luminous
mist spread out with inconceivable rapidity, and in the midst of
this blazed the central nucleus&mdash;the sun which in far-off
ages to come would be the giver of light and heat, of life and
beauty to worlds unborn, to planets which were now only little
eddies of atoms whirling in that ocean of nebulous flame.</p>

<p>For more than an hour the two voyagers stood motionless and
silent, gazing on the indescribable splendours of a spectacle
such as no human eyes but theirs had ever beheld. Every earthly
thought seemed burnt out of their souls by the glory and the
wonder of it. It was almost as though they were standing in the
very presence of God, for were they not witnessing the supreme
act of omnipotence, a new creation? Their peril, a peril such as
had never threatened mortals before, was utterly forgotten. They
had even forgotten each other's presence. For the time being
they existed only to look and to wonder.</p>

<p>They were called at length out of their trance by the
matter-of-fact voice of Murgatroyd saying: "My lord, she's
back to her course. Will I keep the power on full?"</p>

<p>"Eh! What's that?" exclaimed Redgrave, as they both turned
quickly round. "Oh, it's you, Murgatroyd. The power? Yes, keep
it on full till I have taken the bearings."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord, very good." replied the engineer. As he left
the deck Redgrave put his arm round Zaidie and drew her gently
towards him and said: "Zaidie, truly you are favoured among
women! You have seen the beginning of a new creation. You will
certainly be saved somehow after that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you too, dear," she murmured, as though still
half-dreaming. "It is very glorious and wonderful; but what is it
all&mdash;I mean, what is the explanation of it?"</p>

<p>"The merely scientific explanation, dear, is very simple. I
see it all now. The force that was dragging us out of our course
was the united pull of two dead stars approaching each other in
the same orbit. They may have been doing that for millions of
years. The shock of their meeting has transformed their motion
into light and heat. They have united to form a single sun and a
nebula, which will some day condense into a system of planets
like ours. To-night the astronomers on earth will discover a new
star&mdash;a variable star as they'll call it&mdash;for it will
grow dimmer as it moves away from our system. It has often
happened before."</p>

<p>Then they turned back to the conning-tower. The needle had
swung to its old position. The new star, henceforth to be known
in the annals of astronomy as Lilla-Zaidie, had already set for
them to the right of the Astronef and risen on the left, and, at
a distance of over nineteen hundred million miles from the
earth, the corner was turned, and the homeward voyage began.</p>

<p>A few days later they crossed the path of Jupiter, but the
giant was invisible, far away on the other side of the sun.
Redgrave laid his course so as to avail himself to the utmost of
the "pull" of the planets without going near enough to them to
be compelled to exert too much of the priceless R. Force, which
the indicators showed to be running perilously low.</p>

<p>Between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars they made a decided
economy by landing on Ceres, one of the largest of the
asteroids, and travelling about fifty million miles on her
towards the orbit of the earth without any expenditure of force
whatever. They found the tiny world possessed of a breathable
atmosphere and a fluid resembling water but nearly as dense as
mercury. A couple of flasks of it form the greatest treasures of
the British Museum and the National Museum at Washington. The
vegetable world was represented by coarse grass, lichens, and
dwarf shrubs, and the animal by different species of worms,
lizards and flies, and small burrowing animals of the rodent
type.</p>

<p>As the orbit of Ceres, like that of the other asteroids, is
considerably inclined to that of the earth, the Astronef rose
from its surface when the plane of the earth's revolution was
reached, and the glittering swarm of miniature planets plunged
away into space beneath them.</p>

<p>"Where to now?" said Zaidie, as her husband came down on deck
from the conning-tower.</p>

<p>"I am going to try to steer a middle course between the
orbits of Mercury and Venus," he replied. "They just happen to
be so placed now that we ought to be able to get the advantage
of the pull of both of them as we pass, and that will save us a
lot of power. The only thing I'm afraid of is the pull of the
sun, equal to goodness knows how many times the attraction of
all the planets put together. You see, little woman, it's like
this," he went on, taking out a pencil and going down on one
knee on the deck: "Here's the Astronef; there's Venus; there's
Mercury; there's the sun; and there, away on the other side of
him, is Mother Earth: If we can turn that corner safely and
without expending too much power we should be all right."</p>

<p>"And if we can't, what will happen?"</p>

<p>"It will be a choice between morphine and cremation in the
atmosphere of the sun, dear, or rather gradually roasting as we
fall towards it."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, it will be morphine," she said quite
quietly, as she turned away from his diagram and looked at the
now fast increasing disc of the sun. A well-balanced mind
speedily becomes accustomed even to the most terrible perils,
and Zaidie had now looked this one so long and so steadily in
the face that for her it had already become merely the choice
between two forms of death with just a chance of escape hidden
in the closed hand of Fate.</p>

<p>Thirty-six earth-hours later the glorious golden disc of
Venus lay broad and bright beneath them. Above was the blazing
orb of the Sun, nearly half as big again as it appears from the
earth, with Mercury, a round black spot, travelling slowly
across it.</p>

<p>"My dear Bird-Folk!" said Zaidie, looking down at the lovely
world below them. "If home wasn't home-"</p>

<p>"We can be back among them in a few hours with absolute
safety," interrupted her husband, catching at the suggestion.
"I've told you the truth about getting back to the earth. It's
only a chance at best, and even if we pass the sun we may not
have force enough left to prevent the Astronef from being
smashed to dust or burnt up in the atmosphere. After all we
might do worse-"</p>

<p>"What would you do if you were alone, Rollo?" she said,
interrupting him in turn.</p>

<p>"I should take my chance and go on. After all home's home and
worth a struggle. But you, dear-"</p>

<p>"I'm you, and so I take the same chances as you do. Besides,
we're not perfect enough for a world where there isn't any sin.
We should probably get quite miserable there. No, home's home,
as you say."</p>

<p>"Then home it is, dear!" he replied.</p>

<p>The vast, resplendent hemisphere of the Love-Star sunk down
into the vault of space, growing swiftly smaller and dimmer as
the Astronef sped towards the little black spot on the face of
the sun, which to them was like a buoy marking a place of utter
and hopeless shipwreck in the ocean of immensity.</p>

<p>The chronometer, still set to earth time, had now begun to
mark the last hours of the Astronef's voyage. She was not only
travelling at a speed of which figures could give no
comprehensible idea, but the Sun, Mercury, and the Earth were
rushing towards her with a compound velocity, composed of the
movement of the Solar System through space and of the movement
of the two planets round the sun.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd was at his post in the engine-room. Redgrave and
Zaidie had gone into the conning-tower, perhaps for the last
time. For good fortune or evil, for life or death, they would
see the end of the voyage together.</p>

<p>"How far yet, dear?" she said, as Venus began to slip away
behind them, rising like a splendid moon in their wake.</p>

<p>"Only sixty million miles or so, a matter of a few hours,
more or less &mdash;it all depends," he replied, without taking
his eyes off the compass.</p>

<p>"Sixty millions! Why I feel almost at home again."</p>

<p>"But we have to turn the corner of the street yet, dear, and
after that there's a fall of more than twenty-five million miles
on to the more or less kindly breast of Mother Earth."</p>

<p>"A fall! It does sound rather awful when you put it that way;
but I am not going to let you frighten me. I believe Mother
Earth will receive her wandering children quite as kindly as
they deserve."</p>

<p>The moon-like disc of Venus grew swiftly smaller, and the
black spot on the face of the sun larger and larger as the
Astronef rushed silently and imperceptibly, and yet with almost
inconceivable velocity, towards doom or fortune. Neither Zaidie
nor Redgrave spoke again for nearly three hours &mdash;hours
which to them seemed to pass like so many minutes. Their eyes
were fixed on the black disc of Mercury, which, as they
approached it, expanded with magical rapidity till it completely
eclipsed the blazing orb behind it. Their thoughts were far away
on the still invisible earth and all the splendid possibilities
that it held for two young lives like theirs.</p>

<p>As the sunlight vanished they looked at each other in the
golden moonlight of Venus, and Zaiclie let her head rest for a
moment on her husband's shoulder. Then a swiftly broadening
gleam of light shot out from behind the black circle of Mercury.
The first crisis had come. Redgrave put out his hand to the
signal-board and rang for full power. The planet seemed to swing
round as the Astronef rushed into the blaze. In a few minutes it
passed through the phases from "new" to "full." Venus became
eclipsed in turn as they swung between Mercury and the Sun, and
then Redgrave, after a rapid glance to either side, said:</p>

<p>"If we can only keep the two pulls balanced we shall do it.
That will keep us in a straight line, and our own momentum ought
to carry us into the earth's attraction."</p>

<p>Zaidie did not reply. She was shading her eyes with her hand
from the almost intolerable brilliance of the sun's rays, and
looking straight ahead to catch the first glimpse of the
silver-grey orb. Her husband read her thoughts and respected them.
But a few minutes later he startled her out of her dream of home by
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Good God, we're turning!"</p>

<p>"What do you say, dear? Turning what?"</p>

<p>"On our own centre. Look! I'm afraid only a miracle can save
us now, darling."</p>

<p>She looked to the left-hand side where he was pointing. The
sun, no longer now a sun, but a vast ocean of flame filling,
nearly a third of the vault of space, was sinking beneath them,
on the right Mercury was rising. Zaidie knew only too well what
this meant. It meant that the keel of the Astronef was being
dragged out of the straight line which would cut the earth's
orbit some forty million miles away. It meant that, in spite of
the exertion of the full power that the engines could develop,
they had begun to fall into the sun.</p>

<p>Redgrave laid his hand on his wife's, and their eyes met.
There was no need for words. Perhaps speech just then would have
been impossible. In that mute glance each looked into the
other's soul and was content. Then he left the conning-tower,
and Zaidie dropped on to her knees before the instrument-table
and laid her forehead upon her clasped hands.</p>

<p>Her husband went to the saloon, unlocked a little cupboard in
the wall and took out a blue bottle of corrugated glass labeled
"Morphine, poison." He took another empty bottle of white glass
and measured fifty drops into it. Then he went to the engine-room
and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd, I'm afraid it's all up with us. We're falling
into the sun, and you know what that means. In a few hours the
Astronef will be red-hot. So it's roasting alive&mdash;or this.
I recommend this."</p>

<p>"And what might that be, my lord?" said the old engineer,
looking at the bottle which his master held vut towards him.
"That's morphine&mdash;poison. Fill that up with water, drink
it, and in half-an-hour you'll be dead without knowing it. Of
course, you won't take it until there's absolutely no hope; but,
granted that, you'll find this a better death than roasting or
baking alive." Then his voice changed suddenly as he went on:
"Of course, I need not say, Murgatroyd, how deeply I regret now
that I asked you to come in the Astronef."</p>

<p>"My lord, my people have served yours for seven hundred
years, and, whether on earth or among the stars, where you go it
is my duty to go also. But don't ask me to take the poison. It
is not for me to say that a journey like this is tempting
Providence, but, by my lights, if I am to die it will be the
death that Providence sends."</p>

<p>"I daresay you're right in one way, Murgatroyd, but it's no
time to argue about beliefs now. There's the bottle. Do as you
think right. And now, in case the miracle doesn't happen,
good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my lord, if it be so," replied the old
Yorkshireman, taking the hand which Redgrave held out to him.
"I'll keep the power on to the last, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you may as well. If it doesn't keep us away from the
Sun it won't be much use to us in two or three hours."</p>

<p>He left the engine-room and went back to the conning-tower.
Zaidie was still on her knees. Beneath and around them the awful
gulf of flame was broadening and deepening. Mercury was rising
higher and growing smaller. He put the bottle down on the table
and waited. Then Zaidie looked up. Her eyes were clear, and her
face was perfectly calm. She rose and put her arm through his,
and said:</p>

<p>"Well, is there any hope, dear? There can't be now, can
there? Is that the morphine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, slipping his arm beneath hers and round
her waist. "I'm afraid there's not much hope now, little womam.
We're using up the last of the power, and you see-"</p>

<p>As he said this he looked at the thermometer. The mercury had
risen from 65 deg. Fahrenheit, the normal temperature of the
interior of the Astronef, to 93 deg., and during the half-minute
that he watched it rose another degree. There was no mistaking
such a warning as that. He had brought two little liqueur
glasses in his pocket from the saloon. He divided the morphine
between them, and filled them up with water.</p>

<p>"Not until the last moment, dear," said Zaidie, as he set one
of them before her. "We have no right to do it until then."</p>

<p>"Very well. When the mercury reaches a hundred and fifty.
After that it will go up ten and fifteen degrees at a jump, and
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, at a hundred and fifty," she replied, cutting short a
speech she dared not hear the end of. "I understand. It will be
impossible to hope any more."</p>

<p>Now, side by side, they stood and watched the
thermometer.</p>

<p>Ninety-five&mdash;ninety-eight&mdash;a hundred and
three&mdash;a hundred and ten&mdash;eighteen&mdash;
twenty-four&mdash;thirty-two &mdash;forty-one&mdash;</p>

<p>The silent minutes passed, and with each the silver
thread&mdash;for them the thread of life&mdash;grew, with
strange contradiction, longer and longer, and with every minute
it grew more quickly.</p>

<p>A hundred and forty-six.</p>

<p>With his right arm Redgrave drew Zaidie still closer to him.
He put out his left hand and took up the little glass. She did
the same.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear, till we have slept and wake again!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darling, God grant that we may!" But the agony of
that last farewell was more than Zaidie could hear. She looked
away at the little glass in her hand, a hand which even now did
not tremble. Then she raised her eyes again to take one last
look at the glory of the stars, and at the Fate incarnate in
flame which lay beneath them.</p>

<p>"The Earth, the Earth&mdash;thank God, the Earth!"</p>

<p>With the hand that held the draught of Lethe&mdash;which in
another moment would have passed her lips&mdash;she caught at
her husband's hand, pulled the glass out of it, and then with a
little sigh she dropped senseless on the floor of the
conning-tower. Redgrave looked for a moment in the direction that
her eyes had taken. A pale, silver-grey crescent, with a little
white spot near it, was rising out of the blackness beyond the
edge of the solar ocean of flame. Home was in sight at last, but
would they reach it &mdash;and how?</p>

<p>He picked her up and carried her to their room and laid her
on the bed. Then he went to the medicine chest again, this time
for a very different purpose.</p>

<p>An hour later, they were on the upper deck with their
telescopes turned on to the rapidly-growing crescent of the
home-world, which, in its eternal march through space, had come
into the line of direct attraction just in time to turn the
scale in which the lives of the star-voyagers were trembling.
The higher it rose, the bigger and broader and brighter it grew,
and, at last, Zaidie&mdash;forgetting in her transport of joy
all the perils that were yet to come&mdash;sprang to her feet
and clapped her hands, and cried:</p>

<p>"There's America!"</p>

<p>Then she dropped back into her long deck-chair and began a
good, hearty, healthy cry.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p class="note">Note.&mdash;The manner of the ending of the
Astronef's marvellous voyage is now as much a matter of public
knowledge as are the circumstances of its beginning. Everyone
knows now how, with the remains of the R force, Lord Redgrave
managed to steer the star-navigator so accurately between the
earth and the moon that, descending obliquely towards the earth,
she became, during eleven days and twelve nights of terrible
suspense, a tiny satellite of the Mother Planet with a
constantly decreasing orbit. How, during one awful hour, by the
exertions of the last unit of power, of which her engines were
capable, she almost grazed the highest peaks of the Bolivian
Andes, swept like a meteor over the foot-hills and plains of the
western slope of Peru and took the waters of the Pacific barely
ten miles from the coast. It is equally needless to recapitulate
the delights and the splendours of the welcome home which the
whole civilised world united to give to Lord Redgrave and his
lovely countess, whose diary of the star voyage has, thanks to
her Ladyship's generous condescension, furnished alike the
groundwork and the inspiration of the present series of
narratives.</p>
