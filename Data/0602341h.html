<p class="note">For their honeymoon Rollo Lenox Smeaton Aubrey,
Earl of Redgrave, and his bride, Lilla Zaidie, leave the earth
on a visit to the Moon and the principal planets, their sole
companion being Andrew Murgatroyd, an old engineer who had
superintended the building of the Astronef, in which the journey
is made. By means of the "R Force," or Anti-Gravitational Force,
of the secret of which Lord Redgrave is the sole possessor, they
are able to navigate with precision and safety the limitless
ocean of Space. Their adventures on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and
Jupiter have been described in the first four stories of the
series.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE relative position of the two giants of the
Solar System at the moment when the Astronef left the surface of
Ganymede, the third and largest satellite of Jupiter, was such
that she had to make a journey of rather more than 340,000,000
miles before she passed within the confines of the Saturnian
System.</p>

<p>At first her speed, as shown by the observations which
Redgrave took by means of instruments designed for such a voyage
by Professor Rennick, was comparatively slow. This was due to
the tremendous "pull" or attraction of Jupiter and its four
moons on the fabric of the Star Navigator; but this backward
drag rapidly decreased as the pull of Saturn and his System
began to overmaster that of Jupiter.</p>

<p>It so happened, too, that Uranus, the next outer planet of
the Solar System, revolving round the Sun at the tremendous
distance of more than 1,700,000,000 miles, was approaching its
conjunction with Saturn, and thus the pull of the two huge orbs
and their systems of satellites acted together on the tiny bulk
of the Astronef, producing a constant acceleration of speed.</p>

<p>Jupiter and his System dropped behind, sinking, as it seemed
to the wanderers, down into the bottomless gulf of Space, but
still forming by far the most brilliant and splendid object in
the skies. The far distant Sun which, seen from the Saturnian
System, has only about a ninetieth of the superficial extent
which he presents to the Earth, dwindled away rapidly until it
began to look like a huge planet, with the Earth, Venus, Mars,
and Mercury as satellites. Beyond the orbit of Saturn, Uranus,
with his eight moons, was shining with the lustre of a star of
the first magnitude, and far above and beyond him again hung the
pale disc of Neptune, the outer guard of the Solar System,
separated from the Sun by a gulf of more than 2,750,000,000
miles.</p>

<p>When two-thirds of the distance between Jupiter and Saturn
had been traversed, Saturn lay beneath them like a vast globe
surrounded by an enormous circular ocean of many-coloured fire,
divided, as it were, by circular shores of shade and darkness.
On the side opposite to them a gigantic conical shadow extended
beyond the confines of the ocean of light. It was the shadow of
half the globe of Saturn cast by the Sun across his rings. Three
little dark spots were also travelling across the surface of the
rings. They were the shadows of Mimas, Encealadus, and Tethys,
the three inner satellites. Japetus, the most distant, which
revolves at a distance ten times greater than that of the Moon
from the Earth, was rising to their left above the edge of the
rings, a pale, yellow, little disc shining feebly against the
black background of Space. The rest of the eight satellites were
hidden behind the enormous bulk of the planet, and the
infinitely vaster area of the rings.</p>

<p>Day after day Zaidie and her husband had been exhausting the
possibilities of the English language in attempting to describe
to each other the multiplying marvels of the wondrous scene
which they were approaching at a speed of more than a hundred
miles a second, and at length Zaidie, after nearly an hour's
absolute silence, during which they sat with eyes fastened to
their telescopes, looked up and said:</p>

<p>"It's no use, Lenox, all the fine words that we've been
trying to think of have just been wasted. The angels may have a
language that you could describe that in, but we haven't. If it
wouldn't be something like blasphemy I should drop down to the
commonplace, and call Saturn a celestial spinning-top, with
bands of light and shadow instead of colours all round it."</p>

<p>"Not at all a bad simile either," laughed Redgrave, as he got
up from his chair with a yawn and a stretch of his athletic
limbs, "still, it's as well that you said celestial, for, after
all, that's about the best word we've found yet. Certainly the
ringed world is the most nearly heavenly thing we've seen so
far."</p>

<p>"But," he went on, "I think it's about time we were stopping
this headlong fall of ours. Do you see how the landscape is
spreading out round us? That means that we're dropping pretty
fast. Whereabouts would you like to land? At present we're
heading straight for the north pole."</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather see what the rings are like first," said
Zaidie; "couldn't we go across them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we can," he replied, "only we'll have to be a bit
careful."</p>

<p>"Careful, what of&mdash;collisions? I suppose you're thinking
of Proctor's explanation that the rings are formed of multitudes
of tiny satellites?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I should go a little farther than that, I should
say that his rings and his eight satellites are to Saturn what
the planets generally and the ring of the Asteroids are to the
Sun, and if that is the case&mdash;I mean if we find the rings
made up of myriads of tiny bodies flying round with
Saturn&mdash;it might get a bit risky.</p>

<p>"You see the outside ring is a bit over 160,000 miles across,
and it revolves in less than eleven hours. In other words we
might find the ring a sort of celestial maelstrom, and if we
once got into the whirl, and Saturn exerted his full pull on us,
we might become a satellite, too, and go on swinging round with
the rest for a good bit of eternity."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," she said, "of course we don't want to do
anything of that sort, but there's something else I think we
could do," she went on, taking up a copy of Proctor's "Saturn
and its System," which she had been reading just after
breakfast. "You see those rings are, all together, about 10,000
miles broad; there's a gap of about 1700 miles between the big
dark one and the middle bright one, and it's nearly 10,000 miles
from the edge of the bright ring to the surface of Saturn. Now
why shouldn't we get in between the inner ring and the planet?
If Proctor was right and the rings are made of tiny satellites
and there are myriads of them, of course they'll pull up while
Saturn pulls down. In fact Flammarion says somewhere, that along
Saturn's equator there is no weight at all."</p>

<p>"Quite possible," said Redgrave, "and, if you like, we'll go
and prove it. Of course, if the Astronef weighs absolutely
nothing between Saturn and the rings, we can easily get away.
The only thing that I object to is getting into this 170,000
mile vortex, being whizzed round with Saturn every ten and a
half hours, and sauntering round the Sun at 21,000 miles an
hour."</p>

<p>"Don't," she said, "really it isn't good to think about these
things, situated as we are. Fancy, in a single year of Saturn
there are nearly 25,000 days. Why, we should each of us be about
thirty years older when we got round, even if we lived, which,
of course, we shouldn't. By the way, how long could we live for,
if the worst came to the worst?"</p>

<p>"About two earth-years at the outside," he replied, "but, of
course, we shall be home long before that."</p>

<p>"If we don't become one of the satellites of Saturn," she
replied, "or get dragged away by something into the outer depths
of Space."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the downward speed of the Astronef had been
considerably checked. The vast circle of the rings seemed to
suddenly expand, though it now covered the whole floor of the
vault of Space.</p>

<p>As the Astronef dropped towards what might be called the
limit of the northern tropic of Saturn, the spectacle presented
by the rings became every minute more and more
marvellous&mdash;purple and silver, black and gold, dotted with
myriads of brilliant points of many-coloured lights, they
stretched upwards like vast rainbows in the Saturnian sky as the
Astronef's position changed with regard to the horizon of the
planet. The nearer they approached the surface, the nearer the
gigantic arch of the many coloured rings approached the zenith.
Sun and stars sank down behind it, for now they were dropping
through the fifteen-year-long twilight that reigns over that
portion of the globe of Saturn which during half of his year of
thirty terrestrial years is turned away from the Sun.</p>

<p>The further they dropped towards the rings the more certain
it became that the theory of the great English astronomer was
the correct one. Seen through the telescopes at a distance of
only thirty or forty thousand miles, it became perfectly plain
that the outer or darker ring as seen from the Earth, was
composed of myriads of tiny bodies so far separated from each
other that the rayless blackness of Space could be seen through
them.</p>

<p>"It's quite evident," said Redgrave, "that those are rings of
what we should call meteorites on earth, atoms of matter which
Saturn threw off into Space after the satellites were formed
."</p>

<p>"And I shouldn't wonder, if you will excuse my interrupting
you," said Zaidie, "if the moons themselves have been made up of
a lot of these things going together when they were only gas, or
nebula or something of that sort. In fact, when Saturn was a
good deal younger than he is now, he may have had a lot more
rings and no moons, and now these aerolites, or whatever they
are, can't come together and make moons, because they've got too
solid."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Astronef was dropping rapidly down towards the
port on of Saturn's surface which was illuminated by the rays of
the Sun, streaming under the lower arch of the inner ring.</p>

<p>As they passed under it the whole scene suddenly changed. The
rings vanished. Overhead was an arch of brilliant light a
hundred miles thick, spanning the whole of the visible heavens.
Below lay the sunlit surface of Saturn divided into light and
dark bands of enormous breadth.</p>

<p>The band immediately below them was of a brilliant silver-grey,
very much like the central zone of Jupiter. North of this
on the one side stretched the long shadow of the rings, and
southward other bands of alternating white and gold and deep
purple succeeded each other till they were lost in the curvature
of the vast planet. The poles were of course invisible since the
Astronef was now too near to the surface; but on their approach
they had seen unmistakable evidence of snow and ice.</p>

<p>As soon as they were exactly under the Ring-arch, Redgrave
shut off the R. Force, and, somewhat to their astonishment, the
Astronef began to revolve slowly on its axis, giving them the
idea that the Saturnian System was revolving round them. The
arch seemed to sink beneath their feet while the belts of the
planet rose above them.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter?" said Zaidie. "Everything has
gone upside down."</p>

<p>"Which shows." replied Redgrave, "that as soon as the
Astronef became neutral the rings pulled harder than the planet,
I suppose because we're so near to them, and, instead of falling
on to Saturn, we shall have to push up at him."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I see that," said Zaidie, "but after all it does
look a little bit bewildering, doesn't it, to be on your feet
one minute and on your head the next?"</p>

<p>"It is, rather; but you ought to be getting accustomed to
that sort of thing now. In a few minutes neither you, nor I, nor
anything else will have any weight. We shall be just between the
attraction of the Rings and Saturn, so you'd better go and sit
down, for if you were to give a bit of an extra spring in
walking you might be knocking that pretty head of yours against
the roof," said Redgrave, as he went to turn the R. Force on to
the edge of the Rings.</p>

<p>A vast sea of silver cloud seemed now to descend upon them.
Then they entered it, and for nearly half-an-hour the Astronef
was totally enveloped in a sea of pearl-grey luminous mist.</p>

<p>"Atmosphere!" said Redgrave, as he went to the conning-tower
and signalled to Murgatroyd to start the propellers. They
continued to rise and the mist began to drift past them in
patches, showing that the propellers were driving them
ahead.</p>

<p>They now rose swiftly towards the surface of the planet. The
cloud wrack got thinner and thinner, and presently they found
themselves floating in a clear atmosphere between two seas of
cloud, the one above them being much less dense than the one
below.</p>

<p>"I believe we shall see Saturn on the other side of that,"
said Zaidie, looking up at it. "Oh dear, there we are going
round again."</p>

<p>"Reaching the point of neutral attraction," said Redgrave;
"once more you'd better sit down in case of accidents."</p>

<p>Instead of dropping into her deck chair as she would have
done on Earth, she took hold of the arms and pulled herself into
it, saying:</p>

<p>"Really it seems rather absurd to have to do this sort of
thing. Fancy having to hold yourself into a chair. I suppose I
hardly weigh anything at all now."</p>

<p>"Not much," said Redgrave, stooping down and taking hold of
the end of the chair with both hands. Without any apparent
effort he raised her about five feet from the floor, and held
her there while the Astronef made another revolution. For a
moment he let go, and she and the chair floated between the roof
and the floor of the deck-chamber. Then he pulled the chair away
from under her, and as the floor of the vessel once more turned
towards Saturn, he took hold of her hands and brought her to her
feet on deck again.</p>

<br>

<p>"I ought to have had a photograph of you like that!" he
laughed. "I wonder what they'd think of it at home?"</p>

<p>"If you had taken one I should certainly have broken the
negative. The very idea, a photograph of me standing on nothing!
Besides, they'd never believe it on Earth."</p>

<p>"We might have got old Andrew to make an affidavit to that
effect," he began.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Lenox! Look! There's something much
more interesting. There's Saturn at last. Now I wonder if we
shall find any sort of life there&mdash;and shall we be able to
breathe the air?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," he said, as the Astronef dropped slowly
through the thin cloud-veil. "You know spectrum analysis has
proved that there is a gas in Saturn's atmosphere which we know
nothing about, and, whatever it may be for the inhabitants' it's
not very likely that it would agree with us, so I think we'd
better be content with our own. Besides, the atmosphere is so
enormously dense that even if we could breathe it it might
squash us up. You see we're only accustomed to fifteen pounds on
the square inch, and it may be hundreds of pounds here."</p>

<p>"Well," said Zaidie, "I haven't got any particular desire to
be flattened out like that, or squeezed dry like an orange. It's
not at all a nice idea, is it? But, look, Lenox," she went on,
pointing downwards, "surely this isn't air at all, or at least
it's something between air and water. Aren't these things
swimming about in it&mdash;something like fish in the sea? They
can't be clouds, and they aren't either fish or birds. They
don't fly or float. Well, this is certainly more wonderful than
anything else we've seen, though it doesn't look very pleasant.
They're not nice looking, are they? I wonder if they are at all
dangerous!"</p>

<p>While she was saying this Zaidie had gone to her telescope,
and was sweeping the surface of Saturn, which was now about 100
miles distant. Her husband was doing the same. In fact, for the
time being they were all eyes, for they were looking on a
stranger sight than human beings had ever seen before.</p>

<p>Underneath the inner cloud-veil the atmosphere of Saturn
appeared to them somewhat as the lower depths of the ocean would
appear to a diver, granted that he was able to see for hundreds
of miles about him. Its colour was a pale greenish yellow. The
outside thermometers showed that the temperature was a hundred
and seventy-five. In fact the interior of the Astronef was
getting uncomfortably like a Turkish bath, and Redgrave took the
opportunity of at once freshening and cooling the air by
releasing a little from the cylinders where it was stored in
liquid form.</p>

<p>From what they could see of the surface of Saturn it seemed
to be a dead level, greyish-brown in colour, and not divided
into oceans and continents. In fact there were no signs whatever
of water within range of their telescopes. There was nothing
that looked like cities, or any human habitations, but the
ground, as they got nearer to it, seemed to be covered with a
very dense vegetable growth, not unlike gigantic forms of
seaweed, and of somewhat the same colour. In fact, as Zaidie
remarked, the surface of Saturn was not at all unlike what the
floors of the ocean of the Earth might be if they were laid
bare.</p>

<p>It was evident that the life of this portion of Saturn was
not what, for want of a more exact word, might be called
terrestrial. Its inhabitants, however they were constituted,
floated about in the depths of this semi-gaseous ocean as the
denizens of earthly seas did in the terrestrial oceans. Already
their telescopes enabled them to make out enormous moving
shapes, black and grey-brown and pale red, swimming about,
evidently by their own volition, rising and falling and often
sinking down on to the gigantic vegetation which covered the
surface, possibly for the purpose of feeding. But it was also
evident that they resembled the inhabitants of earthly oceans in
another respect since it was easy to see that they preyed upon
each other.</p>

<p>"I don't like the look of those creatures at all," said
Zaidie when the Astronef had come to a stop and was floating
about five miles above the surface. "They're altogether too
uncanny. They look to me something like jelly-fish about the
size of whales only they have eyes and mouths. Did you ever see
such awful looking eyes, bigger than soup-plates and as bright
as a cat's. I suppose that's because of the dim light. And the
nasty wormy sort of way they swim, or fly, or whatever it is.
Lenox, I don't know what the rest of Saturn may be like, but I
certainly don't like this part. It's quite too creepy and
unearthly for my taste. Look at the horrors fighting and eating
each other. That's the only bit of earthly character they've got
about them; the big ones eating the little ones. I hope they
won't take the Astronef for something nice to eat."</p>

<p>"They'd find her a pretty tough morsel if they did," laughed
Redgrave, "but still we may as well get some speed on her in
case of accident."</p>

<p>In obedience to a signal to Murgatroyd, the propellers began
to revolve, beating the dense air and driving the Star Navigator
about twenty miles an hour through the depths of this
strangely-peopled ocean.</p>

<p>They approached nearer and nearer to the surface, and as they
did so the strange creatures about them grew more and more
numerous. They were certainly the most extraordinary living
things that human eyes had looked upon. Zaidie's comparison to
the whale and the jelly fish was by no means incorrect; only
when they got near enough to them they found, to their
astonishment, that they were double-headed&mdash;that is to say,
they had a head furnished with mouth, nostrils, ear-holes, and
eyes at each end of their bodies.</p>

<p>The larger of the creatures appeared to have a certain amount
of respect for each other. Now and then they witnessed a
battle-royal between two of the monsters who were pursuing the same
prey. Their method of attack was as follows: the assailant would
rise above his opponent or prey, and then, dropping on to its
back, envelope it and begin tearing at its sides and under parts
with huge beak-like jaws, somewhat resembling those of the
largest kind of the earthly octopus, only very much larger. The
substance composing their bodies appeared to be not unlike that
of a terrestrial jelly-fish, but much denser, and having the
tenacity of soft India rubber save at the double ends, where it
was much harder, in fact a good deal more like horn.</p><br>

<div align="center">

title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">They witnessed a battle-royal between two of
the monsters.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>When one of them had overpowered an enemy or a victim the two
sank down into the vegetation, and the victor began to eat the
vanquished. Their means of locomotion consisted of huge fins, or
rather half fins, half wings, of which they had three laterally
arranged behind each head, and four much longer and narrower,
above and below, which seemed to be used mainly for steering
purposes.</p>

<p>They moved with equal ease in either direction, and they
appeared to rise or fall by inflating or deflating the middle
portions of their bodies, somewhat as fish do with their
swimming bladders.</p>

<p>The light in the lower regions of this strange ocean was
dimmer than earthly twilight, although the Astronef was steadily
making her way beneath the arch of the rings towards the sunlit
hemisphere.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the effect of the searchlight would be on
these fellows!" said Redgrave. "Those huge eyes of theirs are
evidently only suited to dim light. Let's try and dazzle some of
them."</p>

<p>"I hope it won't be a case of the moths and the candle!" said
Zaidie. "They don't seem to have taken much interest in us so
far. Perhaps they haven't been able to see properly, but suppose
they were attracted by the light and began crowding round us and
fastening on to us, as the horrible things do with each other.
What should we do then? They might drag us down and perhaps keep
us there; but there's one thing, they'd never eat us, because we
could keep closed up and die respectably together."</p>

<p>"Not much fear of that, little woman," he said, "we're too
strong for them. Hardened steel and toughened glass ought to be
more than a match for a lot of exaggerated jelly-fish like
these," said Redgrave, as he switched on the head search-light.
"We've come here to see strange things and we may as well see
them. Ah, would you my friend. No, this is not one of your sort,
and it isn't meant to eat."</p>

<p>A huge, double-headed monster, apparently some four hundred
feet long, came floating towards them as the search-light
flashed out, and others began instantly to crowd about them,
just as Zaidie had feared.</p>

<p>"Lenox, for Heaven's sake be careful!" cried Zaidie,
shrinking up beside him as the huge, hideous head, with its
saucer eyes and enormous beak-like jaws wide open, came towards
them. "And look, there are more coming. Can't we go up and get
away from them?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, little woman," replied Redgrave, who was
beginning to feel the passion of adventure thrilling in his
nerves "If we fought the Martian air fleet and licked it I think
we can manage these things. Let's see how he likes the
light."</p>

<p>As he spoke he flashed the full glare of the five thousand
candle-power lamp full on to the creature's great cat-like eyes.
Instantly it bent itself up into an arc. The two heads, each the
exact image of the other, came together. The four eyes glared
half dazzled into the conning-tower and the four huge jaws
snapped viciously together.</p>

<p>"Lenox, Lenox, for goodness sake let us go up!" cried Zaidie
shrinking still closer to him. "That thing's too horrible to
look at."</p>

<p>"It is a beast, isn't it?" he said, "but I think we can cut
him in two without much trouble."</p>

<p>He pressed one of the buttons on the signal board three times
quickly and once slowly. It was the signal for full speed on the
propellers, that is to say about a hundred earth-miles an hour.
The Astronef ought to have sprung forward and driven her ram
through the huge, brick-red body of the hideous creature which
was now only a couple of hundred yards from them; but instead of
that a slow, jarring, grinding thrill seemed to run through her,
and she stopped. The next moment Murgatroyd put his head up
through the companion-way which led from the upper deck to the
conning-tower, and said in a tone whose calm indicated, as
usual, resignation to the worst that could happen:</p>

<p>"My lord, two of those beasts, fishes or live balloons, or
whatever they are, have come across the propellers. They're cut
up a good bit, but I've had to stop the engines, and they're
clinging all round the after part. We're going down, too. Shall
I disconnect the propellers and turn on the repulsion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, Andrew!" cried Zaidie, "and all of it, too.
Look, Lenox, that horrible thing is coming. Suppose it broke the
glass, and we couldn't breathe this atmosphere!"</p>

<p>As she spoke the enormous, double-headed body advanced until
it completely enveloped the forward part of the Astronef. The
two hideous heads came close to the sides of the conning-tower;
the huge, palely luminous eyes looked in upon them. Zaidie, in
her terror, even thought that she saw something like human
curiosity in them.</p><br>

</div>

<br>

<p>Then, as Murgatroyd disappeared to obey the orders which
Redgrave had sanctioned with a quick nod, the heads approached
still closer, and she heard the ends of the pointed jaws, which
she now saw were armed with shark-like teeth, striking against
the thick glass walls of the conning-tower.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, dear!" he said, putting his arm round
her, just as he had done when they thought they were falling
into the fiery seas of Jupiter. "You'll see something happen to
this gentleman soon. Big and all as he is there won't be much
left of him in a few minutes. They are like those monsters they
found in the lowest depths of our own seas. They can only live
under tremendous pressure. That's why we didn't find any of them
up above. This chap'll burst like a bubble presently. Meanwhile,
there's no use in stopping here. Suppose you go below and brew
some coffee and bring it up on deck with a drop of brandy in it,
while I go and see how things are looking aft. It doesn't do you
any good, you know, to be looking at monsters of this sort. You
can see what's left of them later on."</p>

<p>Zaidie was not at all sorry to obey him, for the horrible
sight had almost sickened her.</p>

<p>They were still under the arch of the rings, and so, when the
full strength of the R. Force was directed against the body of
Saturn, the vessel sprang upwards like a projectile fired from a
cannon.</p>

<p>Redgrave went back into the conning-tower to see what
happened to their assailant. It was already trying vainly to
detach itself and sink back into a more congenial element. As
the pressure of the atmosphere decreased its huge body swelled
up into still huger proportions. The skin on the two heads
puffed up as though air was being pumped in under it. The great
eyes protruded out of their sockets; the jaws opened widely as
though the creature were gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Murgatroyd was seeing something very similar at the
after end, and wondering what was going to happen to his
propellers, the blades of which were deeply imbedded in the
jelly-like flesh of the monsters.</p>

<p>The Astronef leaped higher and higher, and the hideous bodies
which were clinging to her swelled out huger and huger, and
Redgrave even fancied that he heard something like the cries of
pain from both heads on either side of the conning-tower. They
passed through the inner cloud-veil, and then the Astronef began
to turn on her axis, and, just as the outer envelope came into
view the enormously distended bulk of the monsters collapsed,
and their fragments, seeming now more like the tatters of a
burst balloon, dropped from the body of the Astronef and floated
away down into what had once been their native element.</p>

<p>"Difference of environment means a lot, after all," said
Redgrave to himself. "I should have called that either a lie or
a miracle if I hadn't seen it, and I'm jolly glad I sent Zaidie
down below."</p>

<p>"Here's your coffee, Lenox," said Zaidie's voice from the
upper deck, "only it doesn't seem to want to stop in the cups,
and the cups keep getting off the saucers. I suppose we're
turning upside down again."</p>

<p>Redgrave stepped somewhat gingerly on to the deck, for his
body had so little weight under the double attraction of Saturn
and the Rings that a very slight effort would have sent him
flying up to the roof of the deck-chamber.</p>

<p>"That's exactly as you please," he said, "just hold that
table steady a minute. We shall have our centre of gravity back
soon. And now, as to the main question, suppose we take a trip
across the sunlit hemisphere of Saturn to, what I suppose we
should call, on Earth, the South Pole. We can get resistance
from the Rings, and as we are here we may as well see what the
rest of Saturn is like. You see, if our theory is correct as to
the Rings gathering up most of the atmosphere of Saturn about
its equator, we shall get to higher altitudes where the air is
thinner and more like our own, and therefore it is quite
possible that we shall find different forms of life in it
too&mdash;or if you've had enough of Saturn and would prefer a
trip to Uranus?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said Zaidie quickly. "To tell you the truth,
Lenox, I've had almost enough star-wandering for one honeymoon,
and though we've seen nice things as well as horrible
things&mdash;especially those ghastly, slimy creatures down
there&mdash;I'm beginning to feel a bit homesick for good old
mother Earth. You see, we're nearly a thousand million miles
from home, and, even with you, it makes one feel a bit lonely. I
vote we explore the rest of this hemisphere up to the pole, and
then, as they say at sea&mdash; I mean our sea&mdash;'bout ship,
and see if we can find our own old world again. After all, it's
more homelike than any of these, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Just take your telescope and look at it," said Redgrave,
pointing towards the Sun, with its little cluster of attendant
planets. "It looks something like one of Jupiter's little moons
down there, doesn't it, only not quite as big?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does, but that doesn't matter. The fact is that it's
there, and we know what it's like, and it's home, if it is a
thousand million miles away, and that's everything."</p>

<p>By this time they had passed through the outer band of
clouds. The huge, sunlit arch of the Rings towered up to the
zenith, and apparently overarched the whole heavens. Below and
in front of them lay the enormous semi-circle of the hemisphere
which was turned towards the Sun, shrouded by its many colored
bands of clouds. The Repulsive Force was directed strongly
against the lower Ring, and the Asfronef dropped rapidly in a
slanting direction through the cloud-bands towards the southern
temperate zone of the planet.</p>

<p>They passed through the second, or dark, cloud-band at the
rate of about three thousand miles an hour, aided by the
Repulsion against the Rings and, the attraction of the planet,
and soon after lunch, the materials of which now consented to
remain on the table, they passed through the clouds and found
themselves in a new world of wonders.</p>

<p>On a far vaster scale, it was the Earth during that period of
its development which is called the Reptilian Age. The
atmosphere was still dense and loaded with aqueous vapour, but
the waters had already been divided from the land.</p>

<p>They passed over vast, marshy continents and islands, and
warm seas, above which thin clouds of steam still hung. They
passed through these, and, as they swept southward with the
propellers working at their utmost speed, they caught glimpses
of giant forms rising out of the steamy waters near the land; of
others crawling slowly over it, dragging their huge bulk through
a tremendous vegetation, which they crushed down as they passed,
as a sheep on earth might push its way through a field of
standing corn.</p>

<p>Yet other shapes, huge winged and ungainly, fluttered with a
slow, bat-like motion, through the lower strata of the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Every now and then during the voyage across the temperate
zone the propellers were slowed down to enable them to witness
some Titanic conflict between the gigantic denizens of land and
sea and air. But her ladyship had had enough of horrors on the
Saturnian equator, and so she was quite content to watch this
phase of evolution (as it had happened on the Earth many
thousands of ages ago) from a convenient distance, and so the
Astronef sped on southward without approaching the surface
nearer than a couple of miles.</p>

<p>"It'll be all very nice to see and remember and dream about
afterwards," she said, "but really I don't think I can stand any
more monsters just now, at least not at close quarters, and I'm
quite sure if those things can live there we couldn't, any more
than we could have lived on Earth a million years or so ago. No,
really I don't want to land, Lenox, let's go on."</p>

<p>They went on at a speed of about a hundred miles an hour,
and, as they progressed southward, both the atmosphere and the
landscape rapidly changed. The air grew clearer and the clouds
lighter. Lands and seas were more sharply divided, and both
teeming with life. The seas still swarmed with serpentine
monsters of the saurian type, and the firmer lands were peopled
by huge animals, mastodons, bears, giant tapirs, nyledons,
deinotheriums, and a score of other species too strange for them
to recognise by any earthly likeness, which roamed in great
herds through the vast twilit forests and over boundless plains
covered with grey-blue vegetation.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>Here, too, they found mountains for the first time on Saturn;
mountains steep-sided, and many earth-miles high.</p>

<p>As the Astronef was skirting the side of one of these ranges
Redgrave allowed it to approach more closely than he had so far
done to the surface of Saturn.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if we found some of the higher forms of
life up here," he said. "If there is anything here that's going
to develop some clay into the human race of Saturn, it would
naturally get up here."</p>

<p>"Of course it would," said Zaidie, "as far as possible out of
the reach of those unutterable horrors on the equator. I should
think that would be one of the first signs they would show of
superior intelligence. Look, I believe there are some of them.
Do you see those holes in the mountain side there? And there
they are, something like gorillas, only twice as big, and up the
trees, too&mdash;and what trees! They must be seven or eight
hundred feet high."</p>

<p>"Tree and cave-dwellers, and ancestors of the future royal
race of Saturn, I suppose!" said Redgrave. "They don't look very
nice, do they? Still, there's no doubt about their being far
superior in intelligence to what we left behind us. Evidently
this atmosphere is too thin for the two-headed jelly-fishes,
and the saurians to breathe. These creatures have found that out
in a few hundreds of generations, and so they have come to live
up here out of the way. Vegetarians, I suppose, or perhaps they
live on smaller monkeys and other animals, just as our ancestors
did."</p>

<p>"Really, Lenox," said Zaidie, turning round and facing him,
"I must say that you have a most unpleasant way of alluding to
one's ancestors. They couldn't help what they were."</p>

<p>"Well, dear," he said, going towards her, "marvellous as the
miracle seems, I'm heretic enough to believe it possible that
your ancestors even, millions of years ago, perhaps, may have
been something like those; but then, of course, you know I'm a
hopeless Darwinian."</p>

<p>"And, therefore, entirely horrid, as I've often said before
when you get on subjects like these. Not, of course, that I'm
ashamed of my poor relations; and then, after all, your Darwin
was quite wrong when he talked about the descent of
man&mdash;and woman. We&mdash;especially the women &mdash;have
ascended from that sort of thing, if there's any truth in the
story at all; though, personally, I must say I prefer dear old
Mother Eve."</p>

<p>"Who never had a sweeter daughter!" he replied, drawing her
towards him.</p>

<p>"And, meanwhile, compliments being barred, I'll go and get
dinner ready," she said. "After all, it doesn't matter what
world one's in, one get's hungry all the same."</p>

<p>The dinner, which was eaten somewhere in the middle of the
fifteen-year-long day of Saturn, was a very pleasant one,
because they were now nearing the turning-point of their trip
into the depths of Space, and thoughts of home and friends were
already beginning to fly back across the thousand-million-mile
gulf which lay between them and the Earth which they had left
only a little more than two months ago.</p>

<p>While they were at dinner the Astronef rose above the
mountains and resumed her southward course. Zaidie brought the
coffee up on deck as usual after dinner, and, while Redgrave
smoked his cigar and Zaidie her cigarette, they luxuriated in
the magnificent spectacle of the sunlit side of Rings towering
up, rainbow built on rainbow, to the zenith of their visible
heavens.</p>

<p>"What a pity there aren't any words to describe it!" said
Zaidie. "I wonder if the descendants of the ancestors of the
future human race on Saturn will invent anything like a suitable
language. I wonder how they'll talk about those Rings millions
of years hence."</p>

<p>"By that time there may not be any Rings," Lenox replied,
blowing a ring of smoke from his own lips. "Look at
that&mdash;made in a moment and gone in a moment&mdash;and yet
on exactly the same principle, it gives one a dim idea of the
difference between time and eternity. After all it's only
another example of Kelvin's theory of vortices. Nebulae, and
asteroids, and planet-rings, and smoke-rings are really all made
on the same principle."</p>

<p>"My dear Lenox, if you're going to get as philosophical and
as commonplace as that I'm going to bed. Now that I come to
think of it, I've been about fifteen earth-hours out of bed, so
it's about time I went. It's your turn to make the coffee in the
morning&mdash;our morning I mean&mdash;and you'll wake me in
time to see the South Pole of Saturn, won't you? You're not
coming yet, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet, dear. I want to see a bit more of this, and
then I must go through the engines and see that they're all
right for that thousand million mile homeward voyage you're
talking about. You can have a good ten hours' sleep without
missing much, I think, for there doesn't seem to be anything
more interesting than our own Arctic life down there. So
good-night, little woman, and don't have too many nightmares."</p>

<p>"Good-night!" she said, "if you hear me shout you'll know
that you've to come and protect me from monsters. Weren't those
two-headed brutes just too horrid for words? Good-night,
dear!"</p>
