  <p>Well, you know, some say she is the daughter of a duke, others that she
    was born in the gutter, and that the handle has been soldered on to her name
    in order to give her style and influence.</p>
  <p>I could say a lot, of course, but &ldquo;my lips are sealed,&rdquo; as the
    poets say. All through her successful career at the Yard she honoured me
    with her friendship and confidence, but when she took me in partnership,
    as it were, she made me promise that I would never breathe a word of her
    private life, and this I swore on my Bible oath&mdash;&ldquo;wish I may die,&rdquo; and
    all the rest of it.</p>
  <p>Yes, we always called her &ldquo;my lady,&rdquo; from the moment that she
    was put at the head of our section; and the chief called her &ldquo;Lady
    Molly&rdquo; in our presence. We of the Female Department are dreadfully
    snubbed by the men, though don&rsquo;t tell me that women have not ten times
    as much intuition as the blundering and sterner sex; my firm belief is that
    we shouldn&rsquo;t have half so many undetected crimes if some of the so-called
    mysteries were put to the test of feminine investigation.</p>
  <p>Do you suppose for a moment, for instance, that the truth about that extraordinary
    case at Ninescore would ever have come to light if the men alone had had
    the handling of it? Would any man have taken so bold a risk as Lady Molly
    did when&mdash;But I am anticipating.</p>
  <p>Let me go back to that memorable morning when she came into my room in a
    wild state of agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The chief says I may go down to Ninescore if I like, Mary,&rdquo; she
    said in a voice all a-quiver with excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; I ejaculated. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for&mdash;what for?&rdquo; she repeated eagerly. &ldquo;Mary,
    don&rsquo;t you understand? It is the chance I have been waiting for&mdash;the
    chance of a lifetime? They are all desperate about the case up at the Yard;
    the public is furious, and columns of sarcastic letters appear in the daily
    press. None of our men know what to do; they are at their wits&rsquo; end,
    and so this morning I went to the chief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I queried eagerly, for she had suddenly ceased speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, never mind now how I did it&mdash;I will tell you all about
    it on the way, for we have just got time to catch the 11 a.m. down to Canterbury.
    The chief says I may go, and that I may take whom I like with me. He suggested
    one of the men, but somehow I feel that this is woman&rsquo;s work, and I&rsquo;d
    rather have you, Mary, than anyone. We will go over the preliminaries of
    the case together in the train, as I don&rsquo;t suppose that you have got
    them at your fingers&rsquo; ends yet, and you have only just got time to
    put a few things together and meet me at Charing Cross booking-office in
    time for that 11.0 sharp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was off before I could ask her any more questions, and anyhow I was
    too flabbergasted to say much. A murder case in the hands of the Female Department!
    Such a thing had been unheard of until now. But I was all excitement, too,
    and you may be sure I was at the station in good time.</p>
  <p>Fortunately Lady Molly and I had a carriage to ourselves. It was a non-stop
    run to Canterbury, so we had plenty of time before us, and I was longing
    to know all about this case, you bet, since I was to have the honour of helping
    Lady Molly in it.</p>
  <p>The murder of Mary Nicholls had actually been committed at Ash Court, a
    fine old mansion which stands in the village of Ninescore. The Court is surrounded
    by magnificently timbered grounds, the most fascinating portion of which
    is an island in the midst of a small pond, which is spanned by a tiny rustic
    bridge. The island is called &ldquo;The Wilderness,&rdquo; and is at the
    furthermost end of the grounds, out of sight and earshot of the mansion itself.
    It was in this charming spot, on the edge of the pond, that the body of a
    girl was found on the 5th of February last.</p>
  <p>I will spare you the horrible details of this gruesome discovery. Suffice
    it to say for the present that the unfortunate woman was lying on her face,
    with the lower portion of her body on the small grass-covered embankment,
    and her head, arms, and shoulders sunk in the slime of the stagnant water
    just below.</p>
  <p>It was Timothy Coleman, one of the under-gardeners at Ash Court, who first
    made this appalling discovery. He had crossed the rustic bridge and traversed
    the little island in its entirety, when he noticed something blue lying half
    in and half out of the water beyond. Timothy is a stolid, unemotional kind
    of yokel, and, once having ascertained that the object was a woman&rsquo;s
    body in a blue dress with white facings, he quietly stooped and tried to
    lift it out of the mud.</p>
  <p>But here even his stolidity gave way at the terrible sight which was revealed
    before him. That the woman&mdash;whoever she might be&mdash;had been brutally
    murdered was obvious, her dress in front being stained with blood; but what
    was so awful that it even turned old Timothy sick with horror, was that,
    owing to the head, arms and shoulders having apparently been in the slime
    for some time, they were in an advanced state of decomposition.</p>
  <p>Well, whatever was necessary was immediately done, of course. Coleman went
    to get assistance from the lodge, and soon the police were on the scene and
    had removed the unfortunate victim&rsquo;s remains to the small local police-station.</p>
  <p>Ninescore is a sleepy, out-of-the-way village, situated some seven miles
    from Canterbury and four from Sandwich. Soon everyone in the place had heard
    that a terrible murder had been committed in the village, and all the details
    were already freely discussed at the Green Man.</p>
  <p>To begin with, everyone said that though the body itself might be practically
    unrecognisable, the bright blue serge dress with the white facings was unmistakable,
    as were the pearl and ruby ring and the red leather purse found by Inspector
    Meisures close to the murdered woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>Within two hours of Timothy Coleman&rsquo;s gruesome find the identity of
    the unfortunate victim was firmly established as that of Mary Nicholls, who
    lived with her sister Susan at 2, Elm Cottages, in Ninescore Lane, almost
    opposite Ash Court. It was also known that when the police called at that
    address they found the place locked and apparently uninhabited.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hooker, who lived at No. 1 next door, explained to Inspector Meisures
    that Susan and Mary Nicholls had left home about a fortnight ago, and that
    she had not seen them since.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a fortnight to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was
    just inside my own front door a-calling to the cat to come in. It was past
    seven o&rsquo;clock, and as dark a night as ever you did see. You could hardly
    see your &rsquo;and afore your eyes, and there was a nasty damp drizzle comin&rsquo; from
    everywhere. Susan and Mary come out of their cottage; I couldn&rsquo;t rightly
    see Susan, but I &rsquo;eard Mary&rsquo;s voice quite distinck. She says: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
    have to &rsquo;urry,&rsquo; says she. I, thinkin&rsquo; they might be goin&rsquo; to
    do some shoppin&rsquo; in the village, calls out to them that I&rsquo;d just &rsquo;eard
    the church clock strike seven, and that bein&rsquo; Thursday, and early closin&rsquo;,
    they&rsquo;d find all the shops shut at Ninescore. But they took no notice,
    and walked off towards the village, and that&rsquo;s the last I ever seed
    o&rsquo; them two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Further questioning among the village folk brought forth many curious details.
    It seems that Mary Nicholls was a very flighty young woman, about whom there
    had already been quite a good deal of scandal, whilst Susan, on the other
    hand&mdash;who was very sober and steady in her conduct&mdash;had chafed
    considerably under her younger sister&rsquo;s questionable reputation, and,
    according to Mrs. Hooker, many were the bitter quarrels which occurred between
    the two girls. These quarrels, it seems, had been especially violent within
    the last year whenever Mr. Lionel Lydgate called at the cottage. He was a
    London gentleman, it appears&mdash;a young man about town, it afterwards
    transpired&mdash;but he frequently stayed at Canterbury, where he had some
    friends, and on those occasions he would come over to Ninescore in his smart
    dogcart and take Mary out for drives.</p>
  <p>Mr. Lydgate is brother to Lord Edbrooke, the multi-millionaire, who was
    the recipient of birthday honours last year. His lordship resides at Edbrooke
    Castle, but he and his brother Lionel had rented Ash Court once or twice,
    as both were keen golfers and Sandwich Links are very close by. Lord Edbrooke,
    I may add, is a married man. Mr. Lionel Lydgate, on the other hand, is just
    engaged to Miss Marbury, daughter of one of the canons of Canterbury.</p>
  <p>No wonder, therefore, that Susan Nicholls strongly objected to her sister&rsquo;s
    name being still coupled with that of a young man far above her in station,
    who, moreover, was about to marry a young lady in his own rank of life.</p>
  <p>But Mary seemed not to care. She was a young woman who only liked fun and
    pleasure, and she shrugged her shoulders at public opinion, even though there
    were ugly rumours anent the parentage of a little baby girl whom she herself
    had placed under the care of Mrs. Williams, a widow who lived in a somewhat
    isolated cottage on the Canterbury road. Mary had told Mrs. Williams that
    the father of the child, who was her own brother, had died very suddenly,
    leaving the little one on her and Susan&rsquo;s hands; and, as they couldn&rsquo;t
    look after it properly, they wished Mrs. Williams to have charge of it. To
    this the latter readily agreed.</p>
  <p>The sum for the keep of the infant was decided upon, and thereafter Mary
    Nicholls had come every week to see the little girl, and always brought the
    money with her.</p>
  <p>Inspector Meisures called on Mrs. Williams, and certainly the worthy widow
    had a very startling sequel to relate to the above story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A fortnight to-morrow,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Williams to the inspector,  &ldquo;a
    little after seven o&rsquo;clock, Mary Nicholls come runnin&rsquo; into my
    cottage. It was an awful night, pitch dark and a nasty drizzle. Mary says
    to me she&rsquo;s in a great hurry; she is goin&rsquo; up to London by a
    train from Canterbury and wants to say good-bye to the child. She seemed
    terribly excited, and her clothes were very wet. I brings baby to her, and
    she kisses it rather wild-like and says to me: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll take great
    care of her, Mrs. Williams,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;I may be gone some time.&rsquo; Then
    she puts baby down and gives me &pound;2, the child&rsquo;s keep for eight
    weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which, it appears, Mary once more said &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; and
    ran out of the cottage, Mrs. Williams going as far as the front door with
    her. The night was very dark, and she couldn&rsquo;t see if Mary was alone
    or not, until presently she heard her voice saying tearfully: &ldquo;I had
    to kiss baby&mdash;&rdquo; then the voice died out in the distance &ldquo;on
    the way to Canterbury,&rdquo; Mrs. Williams said most emphatically.</p>
  <p>So far, you see, Inspector Meisures was able to fix the departure of the
    two sisters Nicholls from Ninescore on the night of January 23rd. Obviously
    they left their cottage about seven, went to Mrs. Williams, where Susan remained
    outside while Mary went in to say good-bye to the child.</p>
  <p>After that all traces of them seem to have vanished. Whether they did go
    to Canterbury, and caught the last up train, at what station they alighted,
    or when poor Mary came back, could not at present be discovered.</p>
  <p>According to the medical officer, the unfortunate girl must have been dead
    twelve or thirteen days at the very least, as, though the stagnant water
    may have accelerated decomposition, the head could not have got into such
    an advanced state much under a fortnight.</p>
  <p>At Canterbury station neither the booking-clerk nor the porters could throw
    any light upon the subject. Canterbury West is a busy station, and scores
    of passengers buy tickets and go through the barriers every day. It was impossible,
    therefore, to give any positive information about two young women who may
    or may not have travelled by the last up train on Saturday, January 23rd&mdash;that
    is, a fortnight before.</p>
  <p>One thing only was certain&mdash;whether Susan went to Canterbury and travelled
    by that up train or not, alone or with her sister&mdash;Mary had undoubtedly
    come back to Ninescore either the same night or the following day, since
    Timothy Coleman found her half-decomposed remains in the grounds of Ash Court
    a fortnight later.</p>
  <p>Had she come back to meet her lover, or what? And where was Susan now?</p>
  <p>From the first, therefore, you see, there was a great element of mystery
    about the whole case, and it was only natural that the local police should
    feel that, unless something more definite came out at the inquest, they would
    like to have the assistance of some of the fellows at the Yard.</p>
  <p>So the preliminary notes were sent up to London, and some of them drifted
    into our hands. Lady Molly was deeply interested in it from the first, and
    my firm belief is that she simply worried the chief into allowing her to
    go down to Ninescore and see what she could do.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>At first it was understood that Lady Molly should only go down to Canterbury
    after the inquest, if the local police still felt that they were in want
    of assistance from London. But nothing was further from my lady&rsquo;s intentions
    than to wait until then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not going to miss the first act of a romantic drama,&rdquo; she
    said to me just as our train steamed into Canterbury station. &ldquo;Pick
    up your bag, Mary. We&rsquo;re going to tramp it to Ninescore&mdash;two lady
    artists on a sketching tour, remember&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll find lodgings
    in the village, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We had some lunch in Canterbury, and then we started to walk the six and
    a half miles to Ninescore, carrying our bags. We put up at one of the cottages,
    where the legend &ldquo;Apartments for single respectable lady or gentleman&rdquo; had
    hospitably invited us to enter, and at eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning
    we found our way to the local police-station, where the inquest was to take
    place. Such a funny little place, you know&mdash;just a cottage converted
    for official use&mdash;and the small room packed to its utmost holding capacity.
    The entire able-bodied population of the neighbourhood had, I verily believe,
    congregated in these ten cubic yards of stuffy atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Inspector Meisures, apprised by the chief of our arrival, had reserved two
    good places for us well in sight of witnesses, coroner and jury. The room
    was insupportably close, but I assure you that neither Lady Molly nor I thought
    much about our comfort then. We were terribly interested.</p>
  <p>From the outset the case seemed, as it were, to wrap itself more and more
    in its mantle of impenetrable mystery. There was precious little in the way
    of clues, only that awful intuition, that dark unspoken suspicion with regard
    to one particular man&rsquo;s guilt, which one could feel hovering in the
    minds of all those present.</p>
  <p>Neither the police nor Timothy Coleman had anything to add to what was already
    known. The ring and purse were produced, also the dress worn by the murdered
    woman. All were sworn to by several witnesses as having been the property
    of Mary Nicholls.</p>
  <p>Timothy, on being closely questioned, said that, in his opinion, the girl&rsquo;s
    body had been pushed into the mud, as the head was absolutely embedded in
    it, and he didn&rsquo;t see how she could have fallen like that.</p>
  <p>Medical evidence was repeated; it was as uncertain&mdash;as vague&mdash;as
    before. Owing to the state of the head and neck it was impossible to ascertain
    by what means the death blow had been dealt. The doctor repeated his statement
    that the unfortunate girl must have been dead quite a fortnight. The body
    was discovered on February 5th&mdash;a fortnight before that would have been
    on or about January 23rd.</p>
  <p>The caretaker who lived at the lodge at Ash Court could also throw but little
    light on the mysterious event. Neither he nor any member of his family had
    seen or heard anything to arouse their suspicions. Against that he explained
    that &ldquo;The Wilderness,&rdquo; where the murder was committed, is situated
    some 200 yards from the lodge, with the mansion and flower garden lying between.
    Replying to a question put to him by a juryman, he said that that portion
    of the grounds is only divided off from Ninescore Lane by a low, brick wall,
    which has a door in it, opening into the lane almost opposite Elm Cottages.
    He added that the mansion had been empty for over a year, and that he succeeded
    the last man, who died, about twelve months ago. Mr. Lydgate had not been
    down for golf since witness had been in charge.</p>
  <p>It would be useless to recapitulate all that the various witnesses had already
    told the police, and were now prepared to swear to. The private life of the
    two sisters Nicholls was gone into at full length, as much, at least, as
    was publicly known. But you know what village folk are; except when there
    is a bit of scandal and gossip, they know precious little of one another&rsquo;s
    inner lives.</p>
  <p>The two girls appeared to be very comfortably off. Mary was always smartly
    dressed; and the baby girl, whom she had placed in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s
    charge, had plenty of good and expensive clothes, whilst her keep, 5s. a
    week, was paid with unfailing regularity. What seemed certain, however, was
    that they did not get on well together, that Susan violently objected to
    Mary&rsquo;s association with Mr. Lydgate, and that recently she had spoken
    to the vicar asking him to try to persuade her sister to go away from Ninescore
    altogether, so as to break entirely with the past. The Reverend Octavius
    Ludlow, Vicar of Ninescore, seems thereupon to have had a little talk with
    Mary on the subject, suggesting that she should accept a good situation in
    London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the reverend gentleman, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    make much impression on her. All she replied to me was that she certainly
    need never go into service, as she had a good income of her own, and could
    obtain &pound;5,000 or more quite easily at any time if she chose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you mention Mr. Lydgate&rsquo;s name to her at all?&rdquo; asked
    the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said the vicar, after a slight hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what was her attitude then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid she laughed,&rdquo; replied the Reverend Octavius, primly,  &ldquo;and
    said very picturesquely, if somewhat ungrammatically, that &lsquo;some folks
    didn&rsquo;t know what they was talkin&rsquo; about.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All very indefinite, you see. Nothing to get hold of, no motive suggested&mdash;beyond
    a very vague suspicion, perhaps, of blackmail&mdash;to account for a brutal
    crime. I must not, however, forget to tell you the two other facts which
    came to light in the course of this extraordinary inquest. Though, at the
    time, these facts seemed of wonderful moment for the elucidation of the mystery,
    they only helped ultimately to plunge the whole case into darkness still
    more impenetrable than before.</p>
  <p>I am alluding, firstly, to the deposition of James Franklin, a carter in
    the employ of one of the local farmers. He stated that about half-past six
    on that same Saturday night, January 23rd, he was walking along Ninescore
    Lane leading his horse and cart, as the night was indeed pitch dark. Just
    as he came somewhere near Elm Cottages he heard a man&rsquo;s voice saying
    in a kind of hoarse whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open the door, can&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s as dark as blazes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then a pause, after which the same voice added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, where the dickens are you?&rdquo; Whereupon a girl&rsquo;s
    voice replied:  &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>James Franklin heard nothing more after that, nor did he see anyone in the
    gloom.</p>
  <p>With the stolidity peculiar to the Kentish peasantry, he thought no more
    of this until the day when he heard that Mary Nicholls had been murdered;
    then he voluntarily came forward and told his story to the police. Now, when
    he was closely questioned, he was quite unable to say whether these voices
    proceeded from that side of the lane where stand Elm Cottages or from the
    other side, which is edged by the low, brick wall.</p>
  <p>Finally, Inspector Meisures, who really showed an extraordinary sense of
    what was dramatic, here produced a document which he had reserved for the
    last. This was a piece of paper which he had found in the red leather purse
    already mentioned, and which at first had not been thought very important,
    as the writing was identified by several people as that of the deceased,
    and consisted merely of a series of dates and hours scribbled in pencil on
    a scrap of notepaper. But suddenly these dates had assumed a weird and terrible
    significance: two of them, at least&mdash;December 26th and January 1st followed
    by &ldquo;10 a.m.&rdquo;&mdash;were days on which Mr. Lydgate came over to
    Ninescore and took Mary for drives. One or two witnesses swore to this positively.
    Both dates had been local meets of the harriers, to which other folk from
    the village had gone, and Mary had openly said afterwards how much she had
    enjoyed these.</p>
  <p>The other dates (there were six altogether) were more or less vague. One
    Mrs. Hooker remembered as being coincident with a day Mary Nicholls had spent
    away from home; but the last date, scribbled in the same handwriting, was
    January 23rd, and below it the hour&mdash;6 p.m.</p>
  <p>The coroner now adjourned the inquest. An explanation from Mr. Lionel Lydgate
    had become imperative.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Public excitement had by now reached a very high pitch; it was no longer
    a case of mere local interest. The country inns all round the immediate neighbourhood
    were packed with visitors from London, artists, journalists, dramatists,
    and actor-managers, whilst the hotels and fly-proprietors of Canterbury were
    doing a roaring trade.</p>
  <p>Certain facts and one vivid picture stood out clearly before the thoughtful
    mind in the midst of a chaos of conflicting and irrelevant evidence: the
    picture was that of the two women tramping in the wet and pitch dark night
    towards Canterbury. Beyond that everything was a blur.</p>
  <p>When did Mary Nicholls come back to Ninescore, and why?</p>
  <p>To keep an appointment made with Lionel Lydgate, it was openly whispered;
    but that appointment&mdash;if the rough notes were interpreted rightly&mdash;was
    for the very day on which she and her sister went away from home. A man&rsquo;s
    voice called to her at half-past six certainly, and she replied to it. Franklin,
    the carter, heard her; but half an hour afterwards Mrs. Hooker heard her
    voice when she left home with her sister, and she visited Mrs. Williams after
    that.</p>
  <p>The only theory compatible with all this was, of course, that Mary merely
    accompanied Susan part of the way to Canterbury, then went back to meet her
    lover, who enticed her into the deserted grounds of Ash Court, and there
    murdered her.</p>
  <p>The motive was not far to seek. Mr. Lionel Lydgate, about to marry, wished
    to silence for ever a voice that threatened to be unpleasantly persistent
    in its demands for money and in its threats of scandal.</p>
  <p>But there was one great argument against that theory&mdash;the disappearance
    of Susan Nicholls. She had been extensively advertised for. The murder of
    her sister was published broadcast in every newspaper in the United Kingdom&mdash;she
    could not be ignorant of it. And, above all, she hated Mr. Lydgate. Why did
    she not come and add the weight of her testimony against him if, indeed,
    he was guilty?</p>
  <p>And if Mr. Lydgate was innocent, then where was the criminal? And why had
    Susan Nicholls disappeared?</p>
  <p>Why? Why? Why?</p>
  <p>Well, the next day would show. Mr. Lionel Lydgate had been cited by the
    police to give evidence at the adjourned inquest.</p>
  <p>Good-looking, very athletic, and obviously frightfully upset and nervous,
    he entered the little courtroom, accompanied by his solicitor, just before
    the coroner and jury took their seats.</p>
  <p>He looked keenly at Lady Molly as he sat down, and from the expression on
    his face I guessed that he was much puzzled to know who she was.</p>
  <p>He was the first witness called. Manfully and clearly he gave a concise
    account of his association with the deceased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was pretty and amusing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I liked to take
    her out when I was in the neighborhood; it was no trouble to me. There was
    no harm in her, whatever the village gossips might say. I know she had been
    in trouble, as they say, but that had nothing to do with me. It wasn&rsquo;t
    for me to be hard on a girl, and I fancy that she has been very badly treated
    by some scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he was hard pressed by the coroner, who wished him to explain what
    he meant. But Mr. Lydgate turned obstinate, and to every leading question
    he replied stolidly and very emphatically:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who it was. It had nothing to do with me, but
    I was sorry for the girl because of everyone turning against her, including
    her sister, and I tried to give her a little pleasure when I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all right. Very sympathetically told. The public quite liked this
    pleasing specimen of English cricket-, golf- and football-loving manhood.
    Subsequently Mr. Lydgate admitted meeting Mary on December 26th and January
    1st, but he swore most emphatically that that was the last he ever saw of
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the 23rd of January,&rdquo; here insinuated the coroner; &ldquo;you
    made an appointment with the deceased then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you met her on that day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most emphatically no,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;I went down
    to Edbrooke Castle, my brother&rsquo;s place in Lincolnshire, on the 20th
    of last month, and only got back to town about three days ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You swear to that, Mr. Lydgate?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page018.jpg" width="529" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do, indeed, and there are a score of witnesses to bear me out.
    The family, the house-party, the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to dominate his own excitement. I suppose, poor man, he had only
    just realised that certain horrible suspicions had been resting upon him.
    His solicitor pacified him, and presently he sat down, whilst I must say
    that everyone there present was relieved at the thought that the handsome
    young athlete was not a murderer, after all. To look at him it certainly
    seemed preposterous.</p>
  <p>But then, of course, there was the deadlock, and as there were no more witnesses
    to be heard, no new facts to elucidate, the jury returned the usual verdict
    against some person or persons unknown; and we, the keenly interested spectators,
    were left to face the problem&mdash;Who murdered Mary Nicholls, and where
    was her sister Susan?</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>After the verdict we found our way back to our lodgings. Lady Molly tramped
    along silently, with that deep furrow between her brows which I knew meant
    that she was deep in thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have some tea,&rdquo; I said, with a sigh of relief,
    as soon as we entered the cottage door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied my lady, dryly. &ldquo;I am going
    to write out a telegram, and we&rsquo;ll go straight on to Canterbury and
    send it from there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Canterbury!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;Two hours&rsquo; walk at least,
    for I don&rsquo;t suppose we can get a trap, and it is past three o&rsquo;clock.
    Why not send your telegram from Ninescore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, you are stupid,&rdquo; was all the reply I got.</p>
  <p>She wrote out two telegrams&mdash;one of which was at least three dozen
    words long&mdash;and, once more calling to me to come along, we set out for
    Canterbury.</p>
  <p>I was tea-less, cross, and puzzled. Lady Molly was alert, cheerful, and
    irritatingly active.</p>
  <p>We reached the first telegraph office a little before five. My lady sent
    the telegram without condescending to tell me anything of its destination
    or contents; then she took me to the Castle Hotel and graciously offered
    me tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I be allowed to inquire whether you propose tramping back to
    Ninescore to-night?&rdquo; I asked with a slight touch of sarcasm, as I really
    felt put out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Mary,&rdquo; she replied, quietly munching a bit of Sally Lunn; &ldquo;I
    have engaged a couple of rooms at this hotel and wired the chief that any
    message will find us here to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After that there was nothing for it but quietude, patience, and finally
    supper and bed.</p>
  <p>The next morning my lady walked into my room before I had finished dressing.
    She had a newspaper in her hand, and threw it down on the bed as she said
    calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was in the evening paper all right last night. I think we shall
    be in time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No use asking her what &ldquo;it&rdquo; meant. It was easier to pick up
    the paper, which I did. It was a late edition of one of the leading London
    evening shockers, and at once the front page, with its startling headline,
    attracted my attention:</p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><b>THE NINESCORE MYSTERY</b><br>
MARY NICHOLL&rsquo;S BABY DYING</p>
  <p>Then, below that, a short paragraph:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We regret to learn that the little baby
    daughter of the unfortunate girl who was
    murdered recently at Ash Court, Ninescore,
    Kent, under such terrible and mysterious
    circumstances, is very seriously ill at the
    cottage of Mrs. Williams, in whose charge
    she is. The local doctor who visited her
    to-day declares that she cannot last more
    than a few hours. At the time of going to
    press the nature of the child&rsquo;s complaint was
    not known to our special representative at
Ninescore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>But before she could reply there was a knock at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A telegram for Miss Granard,&rdquo; said the voice of the hall-porter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Mary,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, eagerly. &ldquo;I told the chief
    and also Meisures to wire here and to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The telegram turned out to have come from Ninescore, and was signed  &ldquo;Meisures.&rdquo; Lady
    Molly read it aloud:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Mary Nicholls arrived here this morning.
    Detained her at station. Come at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary Nicholls! I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; was all I could contrive
    to say.</p>
  <p>But she only replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it! Oh, Mary, what a wonderful thing is human nature,
    and how I thank Heaven that gave me a knowledge of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made me get dressed all in a hurry, and then we swallowed some breakfast
    hastily whilst a fly was being got for us. I had, perforce, to satisfy my
    curiosity from my own inner consciousness. Lady Molly was too absorbed to
    take any notice of me. Evidently the chief knew what she had done and approved
    of it: the telegram from Meisures pointed to that.</p>
  <p>My lady had suddenly become a personality. Dressed very quietly, and in
    a smart close-fitting hat, she looked years older than her age, owing also
    to the seriousness of her mien.</p>
  <p>The fly took us to Ninescore fairly quickly. At the little police-station
    we found Meisures awaiting us. He had Elliot and Pegram from the Yard with
    him. They had obviously got their orders, for all three of them were mighty
    deferential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woman is Mary Nicholls, right enough,&rdquo; said Meisures, as
    Lady Molly brushed quickly past him, &ldquo;the woman who was supposed to
    have been murdered. It&rsquo;s that silly bogus paragraph about the infant
    brought her out of her hiding-place. I wonder how it got in,&rdquo; he added
    blandly; &ldquo;the child is well enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, whilst a smile&mdash;the first
    I had seen that morning&mdash;lit up her pretty face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose the other sister will turn up too, presently,&rdquo; rejoined
    Elliot. &ldquo;Pretty lot of trouble we shall have now. If Mary Nicholls
    is alive and kickin&rsquo;, who was murdered at Ash Court, say I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, with the same charming smile.</p>
  <p>Then she went in to see Mary Nicholls.</p>
  <p>The Reverend Octavius Ludlow was sitting beside the girl, who seemed in
    great distress, for she was crying bitterly.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly asked Elliott and the others to remain in the passage whilst
    she herself went into the room, I following behind her.</p>
  <p>When the door was shut, she went up to Mary Nicholls, and assuming a hard
    and severe manner, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you have at last made up your mind, have you, Nicholls? I suppose
    you know that we have applied for a warrant for your arrest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman gave a shriek which unmistakably was one of fear.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page024.jpg" width="555" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;My arrest?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The murder of your sister Susan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t me!&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Susan <i>is</i> dead?&rdquo; retorted Lady Molly, quietly.</p>
  <p>Mary saw that she had betrayed herself. She gave Lady Molly a look of agonised
    horror, then turned as white as a sheet and would have fallen had not the
    Reverend Octavius Ludlow gently led her to a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; she repeated, with a heart-broken sob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will be for you to prove,&rdquo; said Lady Molly dryly. &ldquo;The
    child cannot now, of course remain with Mrs. Williams; she will be removed
    to the workhouse, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that shan&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said the mother excitedly. &ldquo;She
    shan&rsquo;t be, I tell you. The workhouse, indeed,&rdquo; she added in a
    paroxysm of hysterical tears,  &ldquo;and her father a lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The reverend gentleman and I gasped in astonishment; but Lady Molly had
    worked up to this climax so ingeniously that it was obvious she had guessed
    it all along, and had merely led Mary Nicholls on in order to get this admission
    from her.</p>
  <p>How well she had known human nature in pitting the child against the sweetheart!
    Mary Nicholls was ready enough to hide herself, to part from her child even
    for a while, in order to save the man she had once loved from the consequences
    of his crime; but when she heard that her child was dying, she no longer
    could bear to leave it among strangers, and when Lady Molly taunted her with
    the workhouse, she exclaimed in her maternal pride:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The workhouse! And her father a lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Driven into a corner, she confessed the whole truth.</p>
  <p>Lord Edbrooke, then Mr. Lydgate, was the father of her child. Knowing this,
    her sister Susan had, for over a year now, systematically blackmailed the
    unfortunate man&mdash;not altogether, it seems, without Mary&rsquo;s connivance.
    In January last she got him to come down to Ninescore under the distinct
    promise that Mary would meet him and hand over to him the letters she had
    received from him, as well as the ring he had given her, in exchange for
    the sum of &pound;5,000.</p>
  <p>The meeting-place was arranged, but at the last moment Mary was afraid to
    go in the dark. Susan, nothing daunted, but anxious about her own reputation
    in case she should be seen talking to a man so late at night, put on Mary&rsquo;s
    dress, took the ring and the letters, also her sister&rsquo;s purse, and
    went to meet Lord Edbrooke.</p>
  <p>What happened at that interview no one will ever know. It ended with the
    murder of the blackmailer. I suppose the fact that Susan had, in measure,
    begun by impersonating her sister, gave the murderer the first thought of
    confusing the identity of his victim by the horrible device of burying the
    body in the slimy mud. Anyway, he almost did succeed in hoodwinking the police,
    and would have done so entirely but for Lady Molly&rsquo;s strange intuition
    in the matter.</p>
  <p>After his crime he ran instinctively to Mary&rsquo;s cottage. He had to
    make a clean breast of it to her, as, without her help, he was a doomed man.</p>
  <p>So he persuaded her to go away from home and to leave no clue or trace of
    herself or her sister in Ninescore. With the help of money which he would
    give her, she could begin life anew somewhere else, and no doubt he deluded
    the unfortunate girl with promises that her child would be restored to her
    very soon.</p>
  <p>Thus he enticed Mary Nicholls away, who would have been the great and all-important
    witness against him the moment his crime was discovered. A girl of Mary&rsquo;s
    type and class instinctively obeys the man she has once loved, the man who
    is the father of her child. She consented to disappear and to allow all the
    world to believe that she had been murdered by some unknown miscreant.</p>
  <p>Then the murderer quietly returned to his luxurious home at Edbrooke Castle,
    unsuspected. No one had thought of mentioning his name in connection with
    that of Mary Nicholls. In the days when he used to come down to Ash Court
    he was Mr. Lydgate, and, when he became a peer, sleepy, out-of-the-way Ninescore
    ceased to think of him.</p>
  <p>Perhaps Mr. Lionel Lydgate knew all about his brother&rsquo;s association
    with the village girl. From his attitude at the inquest I should say he did,
    but of course he would not betray his own brother unless forced to do so.</p>
  <p>Now, of course, the whole aspect of the case was changed: the veil of mystery
    had been torn asunder owing to the insight, the marvelous intuition, of a
    woman who, in my opinion, is the most wonderful psychologist of her time.</p>
  <p>You know the sequel. Our fellows at the Yard, aided by the local police,
    took their lead from Lady Molly, and began their investigations of Lord Edbrooke&rsquo;s
    movements on or about the 23rd of January.</p>
  <p>Even their preliminary inquiries revealed the fact that his lordship had
    left Edbrooke Castle on the 21st. He went up to town, saying to his wife
    and household that he was called away on business, and not even taking his
    valet with him. He put up at the Langham Hotel.</p>
  <p>But here police investigations came to an abrupt ending. Lord Edbrooke evidently
    got wind of them. Anyway, the day after Lady Molly so cleverly enticed Mary
    Nicholls out of her hiding-place, and surprised her into an admission of
    the truth, the unfortunate man threw himself in front of the express train
    at Grantham railway station, and was instantly killed. Human justice cannot
    reach him now!</p>
  <p>But don&rsquo;t tell me that a man would have thought of that bogus paragraph,
    or of the taunt which stung the motherly pride of the village girl to the
    quick, and thus wrung from her an admission which no amount of male ingenuity
    would ever have obtained.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheFrewinMiniatures"></a>The Frewin Miniatures</b></h2>
  <p>Although, mind you, Lady Molly&rsquo;s methods in connection with the Ninescore
    mystery were not altogether approved of at the Yard, nevertheless, her shrewdness
    and ingenuity in the matter were so undoubted that they earned for her a
    reputation, then and there, which placed her in the foremost rank of the
    force. And presently, when everyone&mdash;public and police alike&mdash;were
    set by the ears over the Frewin miniatures, and a reward of 1,000 guineas
    was offered for information that would lead to the apprehension of the thief,
    the chief, of his own accord and without any hesitation, offered the job
    to her.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know much about so-called works of art myself, but you can&rsquo;t
    be in the detective force, female or otherwise, without knowing something
    of the value of most things, and I don&rsquo;t think that Mr. Frewin put
    an excessive value on his Englehearts when he stated that they were worth &pound;10,000.
    There were eight of them, all on ivory, about three to four inches high,
    and they were said to be the most perfect specimens of their kind. Mr. Frewin
    himself had had an offer for them, less than two years ago, of 200,000 francs
    from the trustees of the Louvre, which offer, mind you, he had refused. I
    dare say you know that he was an immensely wealthy man, a great collector
    himself, as well as dealer, and that several of the most unique and most
    highly priced works of art found their way into his private collection. Among
    them, of course, the Engleheart miniatures were the most noteworthy.</p>
  <p>For some time before his death Mr. Frewin had been a great invalid, and
    for over two years he had not been able to go beyond the boundary of his
    charming property, Blatchley House, near Brighton.</p>
  <p>There is a sad story in connection with the serious illness of Mr. Frewin&mdash;an
    illness which, if you remember, has since resulted in the poor old gentleman&rsquo;s
    death. He had an only son, a young man on whom the old art-dealer had lavished
    all the education and, subsequently, all the social advantages which money
    could give. The boy was exceptionally good-looking, and had inherited from
    his mother a great charm of manner which made him very popular. The Honourable
    Mrs. Frewin is the daughter of an English peer, more endowed with physical
    attributes than with worldly goods. Besides that, she is an exceptionally
    beautiful woman, has a glorious voice, is a fine violinist, and is no mean
    water-colour artist, having more than once exhibited at the Royal Academy.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, at one time, young Frewin had got into very bad company,
    made many debts, some of which were quite unavowable, and there were rumours
    current at the time to the effect that had the police got wind of certain
    transactions in connection with a brother officer&rsquo;s cheque, a very
    unpleasant prosecution would have followed. Be that as it may, young Lionel
    Frewin had to quit his regiment, and presently he went off to Canada, where
    he is supposed to have gone in for farming. According to the story related
    by some of the servants at Blatchley House, there were violent scenes between
    father and son before the former consented to pay some of the young spendthrift&rsquo;s
    most pressing debts, and then find the further sum of money which was to
    enable young Frewin to commence a new life in the colonies.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frewin, of course, took the matter very much to heart. She was a dainty,
    refined, artistic creature, who idolised her only son, but she had evidently
    no influence whatever over her husband, who, in common with certain English
    families of Jewish extraction, had an extraordinary hardness of character
    where the integrity of his own business fame was concerned. He absolutely
    never forgave his son what he considered a slur cast upon his name by the
    young spendthrift; he packed him off to Canada, and openly told him that
    he was to expect nothing further from him. All the Frewin money and the priceless
    art collection would be left by will to a nephew, James Hyam, whose honour
    and general conduct had always been beyond reproach.</p>
  <p>That Mr. Frewin really took his hereto idolised son&rsquo;s defalcations
    very much to heart was shown by the fact that the poor old man&rsquo;s health
    completely broke down after that. He had an apoplectic fit, and, although
    he somewhat recovered, he always remained an invalid.</p>
  <p>His eyesight and brain power were distinctly enfeebled, and about nine months
    ago he had a renewed seizure, which resulted in paralysis first, and subsequently
    in his death. The greatest, if not the only, joy the poor old man had during
    the two years which he spent pinned to an invalid chair was his art collection.
    Blatchley House was a perfect art museum, and the invalid would have his
    chair wheeled up and down the great hall and along the rooms where his pictures
    and china and, above all, where his priceless miniatures were stored. He
    took an enormous pride in these, and it was, I think, with a view to brightening
    him up a little that Mrs. Frewin invited Monsieur de Colinville&mdash;who
    had always been a great friend of her husband&mdash;to come and stay at Blatchley.
    Of course, there is no greater connoisseur of art anywhere than that distinguished
    Frenchman, and it was through him that the celebrated offer of &pound;8,000
    was made by the Louvre for the Engleheart miniatures.</p>
  <p>Though, of course, the invalid declined the offer, he took a great pleasure
    and pride in the fact that it had been made, as, in addition to Monsieur
    de Colinville himself, several members of the committee of art advisers to
    the Louvre came over from Paris in order to try and persuade Mr. Frewin to
    sell his unique treasures.</p>
  <p>However, the invalid was obdurate about that. He was not in want of money,
    and the celebrated Frewin art collection would go intact to his widow for
    her life, and then to his heir, Mr. James Hyam, a great connoisseur himself
    and art dealer of St. Petersburg and London.</p>
  <p>It was really a merciful dispensation of Providence that the old man never
    knew of the disappearance of his valued miniatures. By the time that extraordinary
    mystery had come to light he was dead.</p>
  <p>On the evening of January the 14th, at half-past eight, Mr. Frewin had a
    third paralytic seizure, from which he never recovered. His valet, Kennet,
    and his two nurses were with him at the time, and Mrs. Frewin, quickly apprised
    of the terrible event, flew to his bedside, whilst the motor was at once
    despatched for the doctor. About an hour or two later the dying man seemed
    to rally somewhat, but he appeared very restless and agitated, and his eyes
    were roaming anxiously about the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I expect it is his precious miniatures he wants,&rdquo; said Nurse
    Dawson.  &ldquo;He is always quiet when he can play with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reached for the large, leather case which contained the priceless art
    treasures, and, opening it, placed it on the bed beside the patient. Mr.
    Frewin, however, was obviously too near death to care even for his favourite
    toy. He fingered the miniatures with trembling hands for a few moments, and
    then sank back exhausted on the pillows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dying,&rdquo; said the doctor quietly, turning to Mrs. Frewin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have something to say to him,&rdquo; she then said. &ldquo;Can
    I remain alone with him for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he himself discreetly retired; &ldquo;but
    I think one of the nurses had better remain within earshot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse Dawson, it appeared, remained within earshot to some purpose, for
    she overheard what Mrs. Frewin was saying to her dying husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is about Lionel&mdash;your only son,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Can
    you understand what I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sick man nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember that he is in Brighton, staying with Alicia. I can go
    and fetch him in the motor if you will consent to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the dying man nodded. I suppose Mrs. Frewin took this to mean acquiescence,
    for the next moment she rang for John Chipps, the butler, and gave him instructions
    to order her motor at once. She then kissed the patient on the forehead and
    prepared to leave the room; but just before she did so, her eyes lighted
    on the case of miniatures, and she said to Kennet, the valet:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give these to Chipps, and tell him to put them in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She then went to put on her furs preparatory to going out. When she was
    quite ready she met Chipps on the landing, who had just come up to tell her
    that the motor was at the door. He had in his hand the case of miniatures
    which Kennet had given him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put the case on the library table, Chipps, when you go down,&rdquo; she
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>He followed her downstairs, then slipped into the library, put the case
    on the table as he had been directed, after which he saw his mistress into
    the motor, and finally closed the front door.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>About an hour later Mrs. Frewin came back, but without her son. It transpired
    afterwards that the young man was more vindictive than his father; he refused
    to go to the latter&rsquo;s bedside in order to be reconciled at the eleventh
    hour to a man who then had no longer either his wits or his physical senses
    about him. However, the dying man was spared the knowledge of his son&rsquo;s
    irreconcilable conduct, for, after a long and wearisome night passed in a
    state of coma, he died at about 6.0 a.m.</p>
  <p>It was quite late the following afternoon when Mrs. Frewin suddenly recollected
    the case of miniatures, which should have been locked in their accustomed
    cabinet. She strolled leisurely into the library&mdash;she was very fatigued
    and worn out with the long vigil and the sorrow and anxiety she had just
    gone through. A quarter of an hour later John Chipps found her in the same
    room, sitting dazed and almost fainting in an arm-chair. In response to the
    old butler&rsquo;s anxious query, she murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The miniatures&mdash;where are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scared at the abruptness of the query and at his mistress&rsquo;s changed
    tone of voice, Chipps gazed quickly around him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You told me to put them on the table, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and
    I did so. They certainly don&rsquo;t seem to be in the room now&mdash;&rdquo; he
    added, with a sudden feeling of terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run and ask one of the nurses at once if the case was taken up to
    Mr. Frewin&rsquo;s room during the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Chipps, needless to say, did not wait to be told twice. He was beginning
    to feel very anxious. He spoke to Kennet and also to the two nurses, and
    asked them if, by any chance, the miniatures were in the late master&rsquo;s
    room. To this Kennet and the nurses replied in the negative. The last they
    had seen of the miniatures was when Chipps took them from the valet and followed
    his mistress downstairs with the case in his hands.</p>
  <p>The poor old butler was in despair; the cook was in hysterics, and consternation
    reigned throughout the house. The disappearance of the miniatures caused
    almost a greater excitement than the death of the master, who had been a
    dying man so long that he was almost a stranger to the servants at Blatchley.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frewin was the first to recover her presence of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send a motor at once to the police-station at Brighton,&rdquo; she
    said very calmly, as soon as she completely realised that the miniatures
    were nowhere to be found. &ldquo;It is my duty to see that this matter is
    thoroughly gone into at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Within half an hour of the discovery of the theft, Detective Inspector Hankin
    and Police Constable McLeod had both arrived from Brighton, having availed
    themselves of Mrs. Frewin&rsquo;s motor. They are shrewd men, both of them,
    and it did not take them many minutes before they had made up their minds
    how the robbery had taken place. By whom it was done was quite another matter,
    and would take some time and some ingenuity to find out.</p>
  <p>What Detective Inspector Hankin had gathered was this: While John Chipps
    saw his mistress into the motor, the front door of the house had, of necessity,
    been left wide open. The motor then made a start, but after a few paces it
    stopped, and Mrs. Frewin put her head out of the window and shouted to Chipps
    some instructions with regard to the nurses&rsquo; evening collation, which,
    in view of Mr. Frewin&rsquo;s state, she feared might be forgotten. Chipps,
    being an elderly man and a little deaf, did not hear her voice distinctly,
    so he ran up to the motor, and she repeated her instructions to him. In Inspector
    Hankin&rsquo;s mind there was no doubt that the thief, who must have been
    hanging about the shrubbery that evening, took that opportunity to sneak
    into the house, then to hide himself in a convenient spot until he could
    find an opportunity for the robbery which he had in view.</p>
  <p>The butler declared that, when he returned, he saw nothing unusual. He had
    only been gone a little over a minute; he then fastened and bolted the front
    door, and, according to his usual custom, he put up all the shutters of the
    ground-floor windows, including, of course, those in the library. He had
    no light with him when he did this accustomed round, for, of course, he knew
    his way well enough in the dark, and the electric chandelier in the hall
    gave him what light he wanted.</p>
  <p>While he was putting up the shutters, Chipps was giving no particular thought
    to the miniatures, but, strangely enough, he seems to have thought of them
    about an hour later, when most of the servants had gone to bed and he was
    waiting up for his mistress. He then, quite casually and almost absent-mindedly,
    when crossing the hall, turned the key of the library door, thus locking
    it from the outside.</p>
  <p>Of course, throughout all this we must remember that Blatchley House was
    not in its normal state that night, since its master was actually dying in
    a room on the floor above the library. The two nurses and Kennet, the valet,
    were all awake, and with him during the whole of that night. Kennet certainly
    was in and out of the room several times, having to run down and fetch various
    things required by the doctor or the nurses. In order to do this he did not
    use the principal staircase, nor did he have to cross the hall, but, as far
    as the upper landing and the secondary stairs were concerned, he certainly
    had not noticed anything unusual or suspicious; whilst when Mrs. Frewin came
    home, she went straight up to the first floor, and certainly noticed nothing
    in any way to arouse her suspicions. But, of course, this meant very little,
    as she certainly must have been too upset and agitated to see anything.</p>
  <p>The servants were not apprised of the death of their master until after
    their breakfast. In the meanwhile Emily, the housemaid, had been in, as usual,
    to  &ldquo;do&rdquo; the library. She distinctly noticed, when she first
    went in, that none of the shutters were up and that one of the windows was
    open. She thought at the time that someone must have been in the room before
    her, and meant to ask Chipps about it, when the news of the master&rsquo;s
    death drove all thoughts of open windows from her mind. Strangely enough,
    when Hankin questioned her more closely about it, and she had had time to
    recollect everything more clearly, she made the extraordinary statement that
    she certainly had noticed that the door of the library was locked on the
    outside when she first went into the room, the key being in the lock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, didn&rsquo;t it strike you as very funny,&rdquo; asked Hankin, &ldquo;that
    the door was locked on the outside, and yet that the shutters were unbarred
    and one of the windows was open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did seem to think of that,&rdquo; replied Emily, with that
    pleasant vagueness peculiar to her class; &ldquo;but then, the room did not
    look like burglars&mdash;it was quite tidy, just as it had been left last
    night, and burglars always seem to leave a great mess behind, else I should
    have noticed,&rdquo; she added, with offended dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But did you not see that the miniatures were not in their usual place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh they often wasn&rsquo;t in the cabinet, as the master used to
    ask for them sometimes to be brought to his room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was, of course, indisputable. It was clearly evident that the burglar
    had had plenty of chances to make good his escape. You see, the actual time
    when the miscreant must have sneaked into the room had now been narrowed
    down to about an hour and a half, between the time when Mrs. Frewin finally
    left in her motor to about an hour later, when Chipps turned the key in the
    door of the library and thus undoubtedly locked the thief in. At what precise
    time of the night he effected his escape could not anyhow be ascertained.
    It must have been after Mrs. Frewin came back again, as Hankin held that
    she or her chauffeur would have noticed that one of the library windows was
    open. This opinion was not shared by Elliott from the Yard, who helped in
    the investigation of this mysterious crime, as Mrs. Frewin was certainly
    very agitated and upset that evening, and her powers of perception would
    necessarily be blunted. As for the chauffeur: we all know that the strong
    headlights on a motor are so dazzling that nothing can be seen outside their
    blinding circle of light.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, it remained doubtful when the thief made good his escape.
    It was easy enough to effect, and, as there is a square of flagstones in
    front of the main door and just below the library windows, the thief left
    not the slightest trace of footprints, whilst the drop from the window is
    less than eight feet.</p>
  <p>What was strange in the whole case, and struck Detective Hankin immediately,
    was the fact that the burglar, whoever he was, must have known a great deal
    about the house and its ways. He also must have had a definite purpose in
    his mind not usually to be found in the brain of a common housebreaker. He
    must have meant to steal the miniatures and nothing else, since he made his
    way straight to the library, and, having secured the booty, at once made
    good his escape without trying to get any other article which could more
    easily be disposed of than works of art.</p>
  <p>You may imagine, therefore, how delicate a task now confronted Inspector
    Hankin. You see, he had questioned everyone in the house, including Mr. Frewin&rsquo;s
    valet and nurses, and from them he casually heard of Mrs. Frewin&rsquo;s
    parting words to her dying husband and of her mention of the scapegrace son,
    who was evidently in the immediate neighbourhood, and whom she wished to
    come and see his father. Mrs. Frewin, closely questioned by the detective,
    admitted that her son was staying in Brighton, and that she saw him that
    very evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Lionel Frewin is staying at the Metropole Hotel,&rdquo; she said
    coldly,  &ldquo;and he was dining with my sister, Lady Steyne, last night.
    He was in the house at Sussex Square when I arrived in my motor,&rdquo; she
    added hastily, guessing, perhaps, the unavowed suspicion which had arisen
    in Hankin&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;and he was still there when I left. I drove
    home very fast, naturally, as my husband&rsquo;s condition was known to me
    to be quite hopeless, and that he was not expected to live more than perhaps
    a few hours. We covered the seven miles between this house and that of my
    sister in less than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This statement of Mrs. Frewin&rsquo;s was, if you remember, fully confirmed
    both by her sister and her brother-in-law, Lady Steyne and Sir Michael. There
    was no doubt that young Lionel Frewin was staying at the Hotel Metropole
    in Brighton, that he was that evening dining with the Steynes at Sussex Square
    when his mother arrived in her motor. Mrs. Frewin stayed about an hour, during
    which time she, presumably, tried to influence her son to go back to Blatchley
    with her in order to see his dying father. Of course, what exactly happened
    at that family interview none of the four people present was inclined to
    reveal. Against that both Sir Michael and Lady Steyne were prepared to swear
    that Mr. Lionel Frewin was in the house when his mother arrived, and that
    he did not leave them until long after she had driven away.</p>
  <p>There lay the hitch, you see, for already the public jumped to conclusions,
    and, terribly prejudiced as it is in a case of this sort, it had made up
    its mind that Mr. Lionel Frewin, once more pressed for money, had stolen
    his father&rsquo;s precious miniatures in order to sell them in America for
    a high sum. Everyone&rsquo;s sympathy was dead against the young son who
    refused to be reconciled to his father, although the latter was dying.</p>
  <p>According to one of the footmen in Lady Steyne&rsquo;s employ, who had taken
    whiskies and sodas in while the interview between Mrs. Frewin and her son
    was taking place, Mr. Lionel had said very testily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, mother, but that is sheer sentimentality.
    The guv&rsquo;nor threw me on my beam ends when a little kindness and help
    would have meant a different future to me; he chose to break my life because
    of some early peccadilloes&mdash;and I am not going to fawn round him and
    play the hypocrite when he has no intention of altering his will and has
    cut me off with a shilling. He must be half imbecile by now, and won&rsquo;t
    know me anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with all this, and with public opinion so dead against him, it was quite
    impossible to bring the crime home to the young man. The burglar, whoever
    he was, must have sneaked into the library some time before Chipps closed
    the door on the outside, since it was still so found by Emily the following
    morning. Thereupon the public, determined that Lionel Frewin should in some
    way be implicated in the theft, made up its mind that the doting mother,
    hearing of her son&rsquo;s woeful want of money, stole the miniatures herself
    that night and gave them to him.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>When Lady Molly heard this theory she laughed, and shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Mr. Frewin was dying, was he not, at the time of the burglary?&rdquo;  she
    said. &ldquo;Why should his wife, soon to become his widow, take the trouble
    to go through a laboured and daring comedy of a burglary in order to possess
    herself of things which would become hers within the next few hours? Even
    if, after Mr. Frewin&rsquo;s death, she could not actually dispose of the
    miniatures, the old man left her a large sum of money and a big income by
    his will, with which she could help her spendthrift son as much as she pleased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was, of course, why the mystery in this strange case was so deep. At
    the Yard they did all that they could. Within forty-eight hours they had
    notices printed in almost every European language, which contained rough
    sketches of the stolen miniatures hastily supplied by Mrs. Frewin herself.
    These were sent to as many of the great museums and art collectors abroad
    as possible, and of course to the principal American cities and to American
    millionaires. There is no doubt that the thief would find it very difficult
    to dispose of the miniatures, and until he could sell them his booty would,
    of course, not benefit him in any way. Works of art cannot be tampered with,
    or melted down or taken to pieces, like silver or jewellery, and, so far
    as could be ascertained, the thief did not appear to make the slightest attempt
    to dispose of the booty, and the mystery became more dark, more impenetrable
    than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you undertake the job?&rdquo; said the chief one day to Lady
    Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;on two distinct conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you will not bother me with useless questions, and that you
    will send out fresh notices to all the museums and art collectors you can
    think of, and request them to let you know of any art purchases they may
    have made within the last two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last two years!&rdquo; ejaculated the chief, &ldquo;why, the
    miniatures were only stolen three months ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did I not say that you were not to ask me useless questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This to the chief, mind you; and he only smiled, whilst I nearly fell backwards
    at her daring. But he did send out the notices, and it was generally understood
    that Lady Molly now had charge of the case.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>It was about seven weeks later when, one morning, I found her at breakfast
    looking wonderfully bright and excited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Yard has had sheaves of replies, Mary,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;and
    the chief still thinks I am a complete fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this, that the art museum at Budapest has now in its possession
    a set of eight miniatures by Engleheart; but the authorities did not think
    that the first notices from Scotland Yard could possibly refer to these,
    as they had been purchased from a private source a little over two years
    ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But two years ago the Frewin miniatures were still at Blatchley House,
    and Mr. Frewin was fingering them daily,&rdquo; I said, not understanding,
    and wondering what she was driving at.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;so does the chief. That
    is why he thinks that I am a first-class idiot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what do you wish to do now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to Brighton, Mary, take you with me and try to elucidate the mystery
    of the Frewin miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I gasped, bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, and you won&rsquo;t until we get there,&rdquo; she replied, running
    up to me and kissing me in her pretty, engaging way.</p>
  <p>That same afternoon we went to Brighton and took up our abode at the Hotel
    Metropole. Now you know I always believed from the very first that she was
    a born lady and all the rest of it, but even I was taken aback at the number
    of acquaintances and smart friends she had all over the place. It was &ldquo;Hello,
    Lady Molly! whoever would have thought of meeting you here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Upon
    my word! this is good luck,&rdquo; all the time.</p>
  <p>She smiled and chatted gaily with all the folk as if she had known them
    all her life, but I could easily see that none of these people knew that
    she had anything to do with the Yard.</p>
  <p>Brighton is not such a very big place as one would suppose, and most of
    the fashionable residents of the gay city find their way sooner or later
    to the luxurious dining-room of the Hotel Metropole, if only for a quiet
    little dinner given when the cook is out. Therefore I was not a little surprised
    when, one evening, about a week after our arrival and just as we were sitting
    down to the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> dinner, Lady Molly suddenly placed
    one of her delicate hands on my arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look behind you, a little to your left, Mary, but not just this minute.
    When you do you will see two ladies and two gentlemen sitting at a small
    table quite close to us. They are Sir Michael and Lady Steyne, the Honourable
    Mrs. Frewin in deep black, and her son, Mr. Lionel Frewin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked round as soon as I could, and gazed with some interest at the hero
    and heroine of the Blatchley House drama. We had a quiet little dinner, and
    Lady Molly having all of a sudden become very silent and self-possessed,
    altogether different from her gay, excited self of the past few days, I scented
    that something important was in the air, and tried to look as unconcerned
    as my lady herself. After dinner we ordered coffee, and as Lady Molly strolled
    through into the lounge, I noticed that she ordered our tray to be placed
    at a table which was in very close proximity to one already occupied by Lady
    Steyne and her party.</p>
  <p>Lady Steyne, I noticed, gave Lady Molly a pleasant nod when we first came
    in, and Sir Michael got up and bowed, saying, &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; We
    sat down and began a desultory conversation together. Soon, as usual, we
    were joined by various friends and acquaintances who all congregated round
    our table and set themselves to entertaining us right pleasantly. Presently
    the conversation drifted to art matter, Sir Anthony Truscott being there,
    who is, as you know, one of the keepers of the Art Department at South Kensington
    Museum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am crazy about miniatures just now,&rdquo; said Lady Molly in response
    to a remark from Sir Anthony.</p>
  <p>I tried not to look astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Miss Granard and I,&rdquo; continued my lady, quite unblushingly, &ldquo;have
    been travelling all over the Continent in order to try and secure some rare
    specimens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Sir Anthony. &ldquo;Have you found anything very
    wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We certainly have discovered some rare works of art,&rdquo; replied
    Lady Molly, &ldquo;have we not, Mary? Now the two Englehearts we bought at
    Budapest are undoubtedly quite unique.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Engleheart&mdash;and at Budapest!&rdquo; remarked Sir Anthony. &ldquo;I
    thought I knew the collections at most of the great Continental cities, but
    I certainly have no recollection of such treasures in the Hungarian capital.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they were only purchased two years ago, and have only been shown
    to the public recently,&rdquo; remarked Lady Molly. &ldquo;There was originally
    a set of eight, so the comptroller, Mr. Pulszky, informed me. He bought them
    from an English collector whose name I have now forgotten, and he is very
    proud of them, but they cost the country a great deal more money than it
    could afford, and in order somewhat to recoup himself Mr. Pulszky sold two
    out of the eight at, I must say, a very stiff price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While she was talking I could not help noticing the strange glitter in her
    eyes. Then a curious smothered sound broke upon my ear. I turned and saw
    Mrs. Frewin looking with glowing and dilated eyes at the charming picture
    presented by Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should like to show you my purchases,&rdquo; said the latter to
    Sir Anthony.  &ldquo;One or two foreign connoisseurs have seen the two miniatures
    and declare them to be the finest in existence. Mary,&rdquo; she added, turning
    to me, &ldquo;would you be so kind as to run up to my room and get me the
    small sealed packet which is at the bottom of my dressing-case? Here are
    the keys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A little bewildered, yet guessing by her manner that I had a part to play,
    I took the keys from her and went up to her room. In her dressing-case I
    certainly found a small, square, flat packet, and with that in my hand I
    prepared to go downstairs again. I had just locked the bedroom door when
    I was suddenly confronted by a tall, graceful woman dressed in deep black,
    whom I at once recognised as the Honourable Mrs. Frewin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are Miss Granard?&rdquo; she said quickly and excitedly; her
    voice was tremulous and she seemed a prey to the greatest possible excitement.
    Without waiting for my reply she continued eagerly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Granard, there is no time to be more explicit, but I give you
    my word, the word of a very wretched, heart-broken woman, that my very life
    depends upon my catching a glimpse of the contents of the parcel that you
    now have in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; I murmured, hopelessly bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no &lsquo;but,&rsquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is a matter
    of life and death. Her are &pound;200, Miss Granard, if you will let me handle
    that packet,&rdquo; and with trembling hands she drew a bundle of bank-notes
    from her reticule.</p>
  <p>I hesitated, not because I had any notion of acceding to Mrs. Frewin&rsquo;s
    request, but because I did not quite know how I ought to act at this strange
    juncture, when a pleasant, mellow voice broke in suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may take the money, Mary, if you wish. You have my permission
    to hand the packet over to this lady,&rdquo; and Lady Molly, charming, graceful
    and elegant in her beautiful directoire gown, stood smiling some few feet
    away, with Hankin just visible in the gloom of the corridor.</p>
  <p>She advanced towards us, took the small packet from my hands, and held it
    out towards Mrs. Frewin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you open it?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frewin did not move. She stood as if turned to stone. Then with dexterous
    fingers my lady broke the seals of the packet and drew from it a few sheets
    of plain white cardboard and a thin piece of match-boarding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Lady Molly, fingering the bits of cardboard while
    she kept her fine large eyes fixed on Mrs. Frewin; &ldquo;&pound;200 is a
    big price to pay for a sight of these worthless things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then this was a vulgar trick,&rdquo; said Mrs. Frewin, drawing herself
    up with an air which did not affect Lady Molly in the least.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A trick, certainly,&rdquo; she replied with her winning smile, &ldquo;vulgar,
    if you will call it so&mdash;pleasant to us all, Mrs. Frewin, since you so
    readily fell into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what are you going to do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Report the matter to my chief,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, quietly. &ldquo;We
    have all been very severely blamed for not discovering sooner the truth about
    the disappearance of the Frewin miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the truth now,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Frewin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do,&rdquo; replied Lady Molly, still smiling. &ldquo;I
    know that two years ago your son, Mr. Lionel Frewin, was in terrible monetary
    difficulties. There was something unavowable, which he dared not tell his
    father. You had to set to work to find money somehow. You had no capital
    at your own disposal, and you wished to save your son from the terrible consequences
    of his own folly. It was soon after M. de Colinville&rsquo;s visit. Your
    husband had had his first apoplectic seizure; his mind and eyesight were
    somewhat impaired. You are a clever artist yourself, and you schemed out
    a plan whereby you carefully copied the priceless miniatures and then entrusted
    them to your son for sale to the Art Museum at Budapest, where there was
    but little likelihood of their being seen by anyone who knew they had belonged
    to your husband. English people do not stay more than one night there, at
    the Hotel Hungaria. Your copies were works of art in themselves, and you
    had no difficulty in deceiving your husband in the state of mind he then
    was, but when he lay dying you realised that his will would inevitably be
    proved, wherein he bequeathed the miniatures to Mr. James Hyam, and that
    these would have to be valued for probate. Frightened now that the substitution
    would be discovered, you devised the clever comedy of the burglary at Blatchley,
    which, in the circumstances, could never be brought home to you or your son.
    I don&rsquo;t know where you subsequently concealed the spurious Engleheart
    miniatures which you calmly took out of the library and hid away during the
    night of your husband&rsquo;s death, but no doubt our men will find that
    out,&rdquo; she added quietly, &ldquo;now that they are on the track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a frightened shriek Mrs. Frewin turned as if she would fly, but Lady
    Molly was too quick for her, and barred the way. Then, with that wonderful
    charm of manner and that innate kindliness which always characterised her,
    she took hold of the unfortunate woman&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me give you a word of advice,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;We
    at the Yard will be quite content with a confession from you, which will
    clear us of negligence and satisfy us that the crime has been brought home
    to its perpetrator. After that try and enter into an arrangement with your
    husband&rsquo;s legatee, Mr. James Hyam. Make a clean breast of the whole
    thing to him and offer him full monetary compensation. For the sake of the
    family he won&rsquo;t refuse. He would have nothing to gain by bruiting the
    whole thing abroad; and for his own sake and that of his late uncle, who
    was so good to him, I don&rsquo;t think you would find him hard to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Frewin paused awhile, undecided and still defiant. Then her attitude
    softened; she turned and looked full at the beautiful, kind eyes turned eagerly
    up to hers, and pressing Lady Molly&rsquo;s tiny hand in both her own she
    whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will take your advice. God bless you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was gone, and Lady Molly called Hankin to her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until we have that confession, Hankin,&rdquo; she said, with the
    quiet manner she always adopted where matters connected with her work were
    concerned, &ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, and after that, too, my lady,&rdquo; replied Hankin, earnestly.</p>
  <p>You see, she could do anything she liked with the men, and I, of course,
    was her slave.</p>
  <p>Now we have got the confession, Mrs. Frewin is on the best of terms with
    Mr. James Hyam, who has behaved very well about the whole thing, and the
    public has forgotten all about the mystery of the Frewin miniatures.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheIrishTweedCoat"></a>The Irish-Tweed Coat</b></h2>
  <p>It all began with the murder of Mr. Andrew Carrthwaite, at Palermo.</p>
  <p>He had been found dead in the garden of his villa just outside the town,
    with a stiletto between his shoulder blades and a piece of rough Irish tweed,
    obviously torn from his assailant&rsquo;s coat, clutched tightly in his hand.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page056.jpg" width="536" height="750"></p>
  <p>All that was known of Mr. Carrthwaite over here was that he was a Yorkshireman,
    owner of some marble works in Sicily, a man who employed a great many hands;
    and that, unlike most employers of labour over there, he had a perfect horror
    of the many secret societies and Socialist clubs which abound in that part
    of the world. He would not become a slave to the ever-growing tyranny of
    the Mafia and its kindred associations, and therefore he made it a hard and
    fast rule that no workman employed by him, from the foremost to the meanest
    hand, should belong to any society, club, or trade union of any sort or kind.</p>
  <p>At first, robbery was thought to have been the sole object of the crime,
    for Mr. Carrthwaite&rsquo;s gold watch, marked with his initials &ldquo;A.
    C.,&rdquo; and his chain were missing, but the Sicilian police were soon
    inclined to the belief that this was merely a blind, and that personal spite
    and revenge were at the bottom of that dastardly outrage.</p>
  <p>One clue, remember, had remained in the possession of the authorities. This
    was the piece of rough Irish tweed, found in the murdered man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>Within twenty-four hours a dozen witnesses were prepared to swear that that
    fragment of cloth was part of a coat habitually worn by Mr. Carrthwaite&rsquo;s
    English overseer, Mr. Cecil Shuttleworth. It appears that this young man
    had lately, in defiance of the rigid rules prescribed by his employer, joined
    a local society&mdash;semi-social, semi-religious&mdash;which came under
    the ban of the old Yorkshireman&rsquo;s prejudices.</p>
  <p>Apparently there had been several bitter quarrels between Mr. Carrthwaite
    and young Shuttleworth, culminating in one tempestuous scene, witnessed by
    the former&rsquo;s servants at his villa; and although these people did not
    understand the actual words that passed between the two Englishmen, it was
    pretty clear that they amounted to an ultimatum on the one side and defiance
    on the other. The dismissal of the overseer followed immediately, and that
    same evening Mr. Carrthwaite was found murdered in his garden.</p>
  <p>Mind you&mdash;according to English ideas&mdash;the preliminary investigations
    in that mysterious crime were hurried through in a manner which we should
    think unfair to the accused. It seemed from the first as if the Sicilian
    police had wilfully made up their minds that Shuttleworth was guilty. For
    instance, although so many people were prepared to swear that the young English
    overseer had often worn a coat of which the piece found in the murdered man&rsquo;s
    hand was undoubtedly a torn fragment, yet the coat itself was not found among
    his effects, neither were his late master&rsquo;s watch and chain.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the young man was arrested within a few hours of the murder,
    and&mdash;after the formalities of the preliminary &ldquo;instruction&rdquo;&mdash;was
    duly committed to stand his trial on the capital charge.</p>
  <p>It was about this time that I severed my official connection with the Yard.
    Lady Molly now employed me as her private secretary, and I was working with
    her one day in the study of our snug little flat in Maida Vale, when our
    trim servant came in to us with a card and a letter on a salver.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly glanced at the card, then handed it across to me. It bore the
    name: Mr. Jeremiah Shuttleworth.</p>
  <p>The letter was from the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much in it,&rdquo; she commented, glancing rapidly at its contents.  &ldquo;The
    chief only says, &lsquo;This is the father of the man who is charged with
    the Palermo murder. As obstinate as a mule, but you have my permission to
    do what he wants.&rsquo;  Emily, show the gentleman in,&rdquo; she added.</p>
  <p>The next moment a short, thick-set man entered our little study. He had
    sandy hair and a freckled skin; there was a great look of determination in
    the square face and a fund of dogged obstinacy in the broad, somewhat heavy
    jaw. In response to Lady Molly&rsquo;s invitation he sat down and began with
    extraordinary abruptness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you know what I have come about&mdash;er&mdash;miss?&rdquo; he
    suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she replied, holding up his own card, &ldquo;I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son, miss&mdash;I mean ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said in a husky
    voice. &ldquo;He is innocent. I swear it by the living&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He checked himself, obviously ashamed of this outburst; then he resumed
    more calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s the business about the coat, and that coat
    did belong to my son, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly, for he had paused again, as if
    waiting to be encouraged in his narrative, &ldquo;what about that coat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been found in London, miss,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;The
    fiendish brutes who committed the crime thought out this monstrous way of
    diverting attention from themselves by getting hold of my son&rsquo;s coat
    and making the actual assassin wear it, in case he was espied in the gloom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the little study for awhile. I was amazed, aghast at
    the suggestion put forward by that rough north-countryman, that sorely stricken
    father who spoke with curious intensity of language and of feeling. Lady
    Molly was the first to break the solemn silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you think, Mr. Shuttleworth, that the assassination of
    Mr. Carrthwaite was the work of a gang of murderers?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Sicily,&rdquo; he replied simply. &ldquo;My boy&rsquo;s mother
    was a native of Messina. The place is riddled with secret societies, murdering,
    anarchical clubs: organisations against which Mr. Carrthwaite waged deadly
    warfare. It is one of these&mdash;the Mafia, probably&mdash;that decreed
    that Mr. Carrthwaite should be done away with. They could not do with such
    a powerful and hard-headed enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right, Mr. Shuttleworth, but tell me more about the coat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;ll be damning proof against the blackguards, anyway.
    I am on the eve of a second marriage, miss&mdash;ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; continued
    the man with seeming irrelevance. &ldquo;The lady is a widow. Mrs. Tadworth
    is her name&mdash;but her father was an Italian named Badeni, a connection
    of my first wife&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s how I came to know him and his
    daughter. You know Leather Lane, don&rsquo;t you? It might be in Italy, for
    Italian&rsquo;s the only language one hears about there. Badeni owned a house
    in Bread Street, Leather Lane, and let lodgings to his fellow-countrymen
    there; this business my future wife still carries on. About a week ago two
    men arrived at the house, father and son, so they said, who wanted a cheap
    bedroom; all their meals, including breakfast, they would take outside, and
    would be out, moreover, most of the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems that they had often lodged at Badeni&rsquo;s before&mdash;the
    old reprobate no doubt was one of their gang&mdash;and when they understood
    that Mrs. Tadworth was their former friend&rsquo;s daughter they were quite
    satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They gave their name as Piatti, and told Mrs. Tadworth that they
    came from Turin. But I happened to hear them talking on the stairs, and I
    knew that they were Sicilians, both of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may well imagine that just now everything hailing from Sicily
    is of vital importance to me, and somehow I suspected those two men from
    the very first. Mrs. Tadworth is quite at one with me in wanting to move
    heaven and earth to prove the innocence of my boy. She watched those people
    for me as a cat would watch a mouse. The older man professed to be very fond
    of gardening, and presently he obtained Mrs. Tadworth&rsquo;s permission
    to busy himself in the little strip of barren ground at the back of the house.
    This she told me last night whilst we were having supper together in her
    little parlour. Somehow I seemed to get an inspiration like. The Piattis
    had gone out together as usual for their evening meal. I got a spade and
    went out into the strip of garden, I worked for about an hour, and then my
    heart gave one big leap&mdash;my spade had met a certain curious, soft resistance&mdash;the
    next moment I was working away with hands and nails, and soon unearthed a
    coat&mdash;<i>the</i> coat, miss,&rdquo; he continued, unable now to control
    his excitement, &ldquo;with the bit torn out of the back, and in the pocket
    the watch and chain belonging to the murdered man, for they bear the initials &lsquo;A.
    C.&rsquo; The fiendish brutes! I knew it&mdash;I knew it, and now I can prove
    the innocence of my boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again there was a pause. I was too much absorbed in the palpitating narrative
    to attempt to breathe a word, and I knew that Lady Molly was placidly waiting
    until the man had somewhat recovered from his vehement outburst.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, you can prove your boy&rsquo;s innocence now,&rdquo; she
    said, smiling encouragingly into his flushed face. &ldquo;But what have you
    done with the coat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left it buried where I found it,&rdquo; he replied more calmly. &ldquo;They
    must not suspect that I am on their track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She nodded approvingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt, then, my chief has told you that the best course to pursue
    now will be to place the whole matter in the hands of the English police.
    Our people at Scotland Yard will then immediately communicate with the Sicilian
    authorities, and in the meanwhile we can keep the two men in Leather Lane
    well under surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me all that,&rdquo; said Mr. Shuttleworth, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I told him that his &lsquo;communicating with the Sicilian police
    authorities&rsquo;  would result in my boy&rsquo;s trial being summarily
    concluded, in his being sent to the gallows, whilst every proof of his innocence
    would be destroyed, or, at any rate, kept back until too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad, Mr. Shuttleworth!&rdquo; she ejaculated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly. &ldquo;You see, you do not
    know Sicily, and I do. You do not know its many clubs and bands of assassins,
    beside whom the so-called Russian Nihilists are simple, blundering children.
    The Mafia, which is the parent of all such murderous organisations, has members
    and agents in every town, village, and hamlet in Italy, in every post-office
    and barracks, in every trade and profession from the highest to the lowest
    in the land. The Sicilian police force is infested with it, so are the Italian
    customs. I would not trust either with what means my boy&rsquo;s life and
    more to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police would suppress the evidence connected with the proofs
    which I hold. At the frontier the coat, the watch and chain would disappear;
    of that I am as convinced as that I am a living man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly made no comment. She was meditating. That there was truth in
    what the man said, no one could deny.</p>
  <p>The few details which we had gleaned over here of the hurried investigations,
    the summary commitment for trial of the accused, the hasty dismissal of all
    evidence in his favour, proved that, at any rate, the father&rsquo;s anxiety
    was well founded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, then, what in the world do you propose to do?&rdquo; said Lady
    Molly after a while. &ldquo;Do you want to take the proofs over yourself
    to your boy&rsquo;s advocate? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that would be no good,&rdquo; he replied simply. &ldquo;I am
    known in Sicily. I should be watched, probably murdered, too, and my death
    would not benefit my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My boy&rsquo;s uncle is chief officer of police at Cividale, on the
    Austro-Italian frontier. I know that I can rely on his devotion. Mrs. Tadworth,
    whose interest in my boy is almost equal to my own, and whose connection
    with me cannot possibly be known out there, will take the proofs of my boy&rsquo;s
    innocence to him. He will know what to do and how to reach my son&rsquo;s
    advocate safely, which no one else could guarantee to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, &ldquo;that being so, what is it that
    you want us to do in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page062.jpg" width="585" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want a lady&rsquo;s help, miss&mdash;er&mdash;ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
    replied, &ldquo;someone who is able, willing, strong, and, if possible, enthusiastic,
    to accompany Mrs. Tadworth&mdash;perhaps in the capacity of a maid&mdash;just
    to avert the usual suspicious glances thrown at a lady traveling alone. Also
    the question of foreign languages comes in. The gentleman I saw at Scotland
    Yard said that if you cared to go he would give you a fortnight&rsquo;s leave
    of absence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly, simply.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>We sat in the study a long while after that&mdash;Mr. Shuttleworth, Lady
    Molly and I&mdash;discussing the plans of the exciting journey; for I, too,
    as you will see, was destined to play my small part in this drama which had
    the life or death of an innocent man for its <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think I need bore you with an account of our discussion; all,
    I think, that will interest you is the plan of campaign we finally decided
    upon.</p>
  <p>There seemed to be no doubt that Mr. Shuttleworth had succeeded so far in
    not arousing the suspicions of the Piattis. Therefore, that night, when they
    were safely out of the way, Mr. Shuttleworth would once more unearth the
    coat, and watch and chain, and then bury a coat similar in colour and texture
    in that same hole in the ground; this might perhaps serve to put the miscreants
    off their guard, if by any chance one of them should busy himself again in
    the garden.</p>
  <p>After that Mrs. Tadworth would hide about her the proofs of young Shuttleworth&rsquo;s
    innocence and join Lady Molly at our flat in Maida Vale, where she would
    spend the night preparatory to the two ladies leaving London for abroad,
    the following morning, by the 9.0 a.m. train from Charing Cross <i>en route</i> for
    Vienna, Budapest, and finally Cividale.</p>
  <p>But our scheme was even more comprehensive than that and herein lay my own
    little share in it, of which I tell you presently.</p>
  <p>The same evening at half-past nine Mrs. Tadworth arrived at the flat with
    the coat, and watch and chain, which were to be placed in the hands of Colonel
    Grassi, the chief police officer at Cividale.</p>
  <p>I took a keen look at the lady, you may be sure of that. It was a pretty
    little face enough, and she herself could not have been much more than seven
    or eight and twenty, but to me the whole appearance and manner of the woman
    suggested weakness of character, rather than that devotion on which poor
    Mr. Shuttleworth so implicitly relied.</p>
  <p>I suppose that it was on that account that I felt unaccountably down-hearted
    and anxious when I bade farewell to my own dear lady&mdash;a feeling in which
    she obviously did not share. Then I began to enact the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which
    had been assigned to me.</p>
  <p>I dressed up in Mrs. Tadworth&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;we were about the same
    height&mdash;and putting on her hat and closely fitting veil, I set out for
    Leather Lane. For as many hours as I could possibly contrive to keep up the
    deception, I was to impersonate Mrs. Tadworth in her own house.</p>
  <p>As I dare say you have guessed by now, that lady was not in affluent circumstances,
    and the house in a small by-street off Leather Lane did not boast of a staff
    of servants. In fact, Mrs. Tadworth did all the domestic work herself, with
    the help of a charwoman for a couple of hours in the mornings.</p>
  <p>That charwoman had, in accordance with Lady Molly&rsquo;s plan, been given
    a week&rsquo;s wages in lieu of notice. I&mdash;as Mrs. Tadworth&mdash;would
    be supposed the next day to be confined to my room with a cold, and Emily&mdash;our
    own little maid, a bright girl, who would go through fire and water for Lady
    Molly or for me&mdash;would represent a new charwoman.</p>
  <p>As soon as anything occurred to arouse my suspicions that our secret had
    been discovered, I was to wire to Lady Molly at the various points which
    she gave me.</p>
  <p>Thus provided with an important and comprehensive part, I duly installed
    myself at Bread Street, Leather Lane. Emily&mdash;who had been told just
    enough of the story, and no more, to make her eager, excited and satisfied&mdash;entered
    into the spirit of her <i>r&ocirc;le</i> as eagerly as I did myself.</p>
  <p>That first night was quite uneventful. The Piattis came home some time after
    eleven and went straight up to their room.</p>
  <p>Emily, looking as like a bedraggled charwoman as her trim figure would allow,
    was in the hall the next morning when the two men started off for breakfast.
    She told me afterwards that the younger one looked at her very keenly, and
    asked her why the other servant had gone. Emily replied with due and proper
    vagueness, whereupon the Sicilians said no more and went out together.</p>
  <p>That was a long and wearisome day which I spent cooped up in the tiny, stuffy
    parlour, ceaselessly watching the tiny patch of ground at the back, devoured
    with anxiety, following the travellers in my mind on their way across Europe.</p>
  <p>Towards midday one of the Piattis came home and presently strolled out into
    the garden. Evidently the change of servants had aroused his suspicions,
    for I could see him feeling about the earth with his spade and looking up
    now and again towards the window of the parlour, whereat I contrived to show
    him the form of a pseudo Mrs. Tadworth moving about the room.</p>
  <p>Mr. Shuttleworth and I were having supper in that same back parlour at about
    nine o&rsquo;clock on that memorable evening, when we suddenly heard the
    front door being opened with a latchkey, and then very cautiously shut again.</p>
  <p>One of the two men had returned at an hour most unusual for their otherwise
    very regular habits. The way, too, in which the door had been opened and
    shut suggested a desire for secrecy and silence. Instinctively I turned off
    the gas in the parlour, and with a quick gesture pointed to the front room,
    the door of which stood open, and I whispered hurriedly to Mr. Shuttleworth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak to him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fortunately, the great aim which he had in view had rendered his perceptions
    very keen.</p>
  <p>He went into the front room, in which the gas, fortunately, was alight at
    the time, and opening the door which gave thence on to the passage, he said
    pleasantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Piatti! is that you? Can I do any thing for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! zank you,&rdquo; replied the Sicilian, whose voice I could
    hear was husky and unsteady, &ldquo;if you would be so kind&mdash;I&mdash;I
    feel so fainting and queer to-night&mdash;ze warm weazer, I zink. Would you&mdash;would
    you be so kind to fetch me a little&mdash;er&mdash;ammoniac&mdash;er&mdash;sal
    volatile you call it, I zink&mdash;from ze apothecary? I would go lie on
    my bed&mdash;if you would be so kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course I will, Mr. Piatti,&rdquo; said Mr. Shuttleworth,
    who somehow got an intuition of what I wanted to do, and literally played
    into my hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went to get his hat from the rack in the hall whilst the Sicilian murmured
    profuse &ldquo;Zank you&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and then I heard the front door bang
    to.</p>
  <p>From where I was I could not see Piatti, but I imagined him standing in
    the dimly-lighted passage listening to Mr. Shuttleworth&rsquo;s retreating
    footsteps.</p>
  <p>Presently I heard him walking along towards the back door, and soon I perceived
    something moving about in the little bit of ground beyond. He had gone to
    get his spade. He meant to unearth the coat and the watch and chain which,
    for some reason or another, he must have thought were no longer safe in their
    original hiding-place. Had the gang of murderers heard that the man who frequently
    visited their landlady was the father of Cecil Shuttleworth over at Palermo?</p>
  <p>At that moment I paused neither to speculate nor yet to plan. I ran down
    to the kitchen, for I no longer wanted to watch Piatti. I knew what he was
    doing.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t want to frighten Emily, and she had been made to understand
    all along that she might have to leave the house with me again at any time,
    at a moment&rsquo;s notice; she and I had kept our small handbag ready packed
    in the kitchen, whence we could reach the area steps quickly and easily.</p>
  <p>Now I quietly beckoned to her that the time had come. She took the bag and
    followed me. Just as we shut the area gate behind us, we heard the garden
    door violently slammed. Piatti had got the coat, and by now was examining
    the pockets in order to find the watch and chain. Within the next ten seconds
    he would realise that the coat which he held was not the one which he had
    buried in the garden, and that the real proofs of his guilt&mdash;or his
    complicity in the guilt of another&mdash;had disappeared.</p>
  <p>We did not wait for those ten seconds, but flew down Bread Street, in the
    direction of Leather Lane, where I knew Mr. Shuttleworth would be on the
    lookout for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said hurriedly, directly I spied him at the angle of
    the street;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all up. I am off to Budapest by the early
    Continental to-morrow morning. I shall catch them at the Hungaria. See Emily
    safely to the flat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obviously there was no time to lose, and before either Mr. Shuttleworth
    or Emily could make a remark I had left them standing, and had quickly mixed
    my insignificant personality with the passers-by.</p>
  <p>I strolled down Leather Lane quite leisurely; you see, my face was unknown
    to the Piattis. They had only seen dim outlines of me behind very dirty window-panes.</p>
  <p>I did not go to the flat. I knew Mr. Shuttleworth would take care of Emily,
    so that night I slept at the Grand Hotel, Charing Cross, leaving the next
    morning by the 9.0 a.m., having booked my berth on the Orient Express as
    far as Budapest.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Well, you know the saying: It is easy to be wise after the event.</p>
  <p>Of course, when I saw the older Piatti standing in the hall of the Hotel
    Hungaria at Budapest I realised that I had been followed from the moment
    that Emily and I ran out of the house at Bread Street. The son had obviously
    kept me in view whilst I was still in London, and the father had travelled
    across Europe, unperceived by me, in the same train as myself, had seen me
    step into the fiacre at Budapest, and heard me tell the smart coachman to
    drive to the Hungaria.</p>
  <p>I made hasty arrangements for my room, and then asked if &ldquo;Mrs. Carey,&rdquo;  from
    London, was still at the hotel with her maid&mdash;for that was the name
    under which Mrs. Tadworth was to travel&mdash;and was answered in the affirmative. &ldquo;Mrs.
    Carey&rdquo; was even then supping in the dining-room, whence the strains
    of beautiful Hungarian melodies played by Berkes&rsquo; inimitable band seemed
    to mock my anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; they told me, was having her meal
    in the steward&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>I tried to prosecute my hasty inquiries as quietly as I could, but Piatti&rsquo;s
    eyes and sarcastic smile seemed to follow me everywhere, whilst he went about
    calmly ordering his room and seeing to the disposal of his luggage.</p>
  <p>Almost every official at the Hungaria speaks English, and I had no difficulty
    in finding my way to the steward&rsquo;s room. To my chagrin Lady Molly was
    not there. Someone told me that no doubt &ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s maid&rdquo; had
    gone back to her mistress&rsquo;s room, which they told me was No. 118 on
    the first floor.</p>
  <p>A few precious moments were thus wasted whilst I ran back towards the hall;
    you know the long, seemingly interminable, corridors and passages of the
    Hungaria! Fortunately, in one of these I presently beheld my dear lady walking
    towards me. At sight of her all my anxieties seemed to fall from me like
    a discarded mantle.</p>
  <p>She looked quite serene and placid, but with her own quick perception she
    at once guessed what had brought me to Budapest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have found out about the coat,&rdquo; she said, quickly drawing
    me aside into one of the smaller passages, which fortunately at the moment
    was dark and deserted, &ldquo;and, of course, he has followed you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I nodded affirmatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Mrs. Tadworth is a vapid, weak-kneed little fool,&rdquo; she
    said, with angry vehemence. &ldquo;We ought to be at Cividale by now&mdash;and
    she declared herself too ill and too fatigued to continue the journey. How
    that poor Shuttleworth could be so blind as to trust her passes belief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she added more calmly, &ldquo;go down into the hall
    at once. Watch that idiot of a woman for all you&rsquo;re worth. She is terrified
    of the Sicilians, and I firmly believe that Piatti can force her to give
    up the proofs of the crime to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are they&mdash;the proofs, I mean?&rdquo; I asked anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Locked up in her trunk&mdash;she won&rsquo;t entrust them to me.
    Obstinate little fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had never seen my dear lady so angry; however, she said nothing more then,
    and presently I took leave of her and worked my way back towards the hall.
    One glance round the brilliantly-lighted place assured me that neither Piatti
    nor Mrs. Tadworth was there. I could not tell you what it was that suddenly
    filled my heart with foreboding.</p>
  <p>I ran up to the first floor and reached room No. 118. The outer door was
    open, and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation I applied my eye to the keyhole
    of the inner one.</p>
  <p>The room was brilliantly lighted from within, and exactly opposite, but
    with his back to me, stood Piatti, whilst squatting on a low stool beside
    him was Mrs. Tadworth.</p>
  <p>A trunk stood open close to her hand, and she was obviously busy turning
    over its contents. My very heart stood still with horror. Was I about to
    witness&mdash;thus powerless to interfere&mdash;one of the most hideous acts
    of cowardly treachery it was possible to conceive?</p>
  <p>Something, however, must at that moment have attracted Piatti&rsquo;s attention,
    for he suddenly turned and strode towards the door. Needless to say that
    I beat a hasty retreat.</p>
  <p>My one idea was, of course, to find Lady Molly and tell her what I had seen.
    Unfortunately, the Hungaria is a veritable maze of corridors, stairs and
    passages, and I did not know the number of her room. At first I did not wish
    to attract further attention by again asking about &ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s
    maid&rdquo; at the office, and my stupid ignorance of foreign languages precluded
    my talking to the female servants.</p>
  <p>I had been up and down the stairs half a dozen times, tired, miserable,
    and anxious, when at last, in the far distance, I espied my dear lady&rsquo;s
    graceful silhouette. Eagerly I ran to her, and was promptly admonished for
    my careless impetuosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tadworth is genuinely frightened,&rdquo; added Lady Molly in
    response to my look of painful suspense, &ldquo;but so far she has been able
    to hoodwink Piatti by opening <i>my</i> trunk before him instead of hers,
    and telling him that the proofs were not in her own keeping. But she is too
    stupid to keep that deception up, and, of course, he won&rsquo;t allow himself
    to be put off a second time. We must start for Cividale as soon as possible.
    Unfortunately, the earliest train is not till 9.15 to-morrow morning. The
    danger to that unfortunate young man over at Palermo, brought about by this
    woman&rsquo;s cowardly idiocy and the father&rsquo;s misguided trust, is
    already incalculable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was, of course, useless for me to express fear now for my dear lady&rsquo;s
    safety. I smothered my anxiety as best I could, and, full of deadly forebodings,
    I bade her anon a fond good-night.</p>
  <p>Needless to say that I scarcely slept, and at eight o&rsquo;clock the next
    morning I was fully dressed and out of my room.</p>
  <p>The first glance down the corridor on which gave No. 118 at once confirmed
    my worst fears. Unusual bustle reigned there at this early hour. Officials
    came and went, maids stood about gossiping, and the next moment, to my literally
    agonised horror, I beheld two gendarmes, with an officer, being escorted
    by the hotel manager to the rooms occupied by Mrs. Tadworth and Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>Oh, how I cursed then our British ignorance of foreign tongues. The officials
    were too busy to bother about me, and the maids only knew that portion of
    the English language which refers to baths and to hot water. Finally, to
    my intense relief, I discovered a willing porter, ready and able to give
    me information in my own tongue of the events which had disturbed the serene
    quietude of the Hotel Hungaria.</p>
  <p>Great heavens! Shall I ever forget what I endured when I grasped the full
    meaning of what he told me with a placid smile and a shrug of the shoulders!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The affair is most mysterious,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;not robbery&mdash;oh,
    no! no!&mdash;for it is Mrs. Carey, who has gone&mdash;disappeared! And it
    is Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s maid who was found, stunned, gagged and unconscious,
    tied to one of the bedposts in room No. 118.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Well, why should I bore you by recounting the agonised suspense, the mortal
    anxiety, which I endured for all those subsequent weary days which at the
    time seemed like so many centuries?</p>
  <p>My own dear lady, the woman for whom I would have gone through fire and
    water with a cheerful smile, had been brutally assaulted, almost murdered,
    so the smiling porter assured me, and my very existence was ignored by the
    stolid officials, who looked down upon me with a frown of impassive disapproval
    whilst I entreated, raged and stormed alternately, begging to be allowed
    to go and nurse the sick lady, who was my own dearest friend, dearer than
    any child could be to its mother.</p>
  <p>Oh, that awful red tapeism that besets one at every turn, paralyses and
    disheartens one! What I suffered I really could not describe.</p>
  <p>But if I was not allowed to see Lady Molly, at least I was able to wreak
    vengeance upon her cowardly assailants. Mrs. Tadworth, by her disappearance,
    had tacitly confessed her participation in the outrage, of that I had no
    doubt, but I was equally certain that she was both too stupid and too weak
    to commit such a crime unaided.</p>
  <p>Piatti was at the bottom of it all. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
    I laid information against him through the medium of an interpreter. I accused
    him boldly of being an accessory to the assault for purposes of robbery.
    Unswervingly I repeated my story of how I had seen him in close conversation
    the day before with Mrs. Carey, whose real name I declared to be Mrs. Tadworth.</p>
  <p>The chief object of the robbery I suggested to be a valuable gold watch
    and chain, with initials &ldquo;A. C.,&rdquo; belonging to my friend, who
    had travelled with Mrs. Carey to Budapest as her companion, not her maid.
    This was a bold move on my part, and I felt reckless, I can tell you. Fortunately,
    my story was corroborated by the fact that the floor valet had seen Piatti
    hanging about the corridor outside No. 118 at an extraordinarily early hour
    of the morning. My firm belief was that the wretch had been admitted into
    the room by that horrid Mrs. Tadworth. He had terrorised her, probably had
    threatened her life. She had then agreed out of sheer cowardice to deliver
    to him the proofs of his own guilt in the Palermo murder case, and when Lady
    Molly, hearing the voices, came out of her own room, Piatti knocked her down
    lest she should intervene. Mrs. Tadworth thereupon&mdash;weak and silly little
    fool!&mdash;was seized with panic, and succeeded, no doubt with his help,
    in leaving the hotel, and probably Budapest, before the outrage was discovered.</p>
  <p>Why Piatti had not done likewise, I could not conjecture. He seems to have
    gone back quietly to his own room after that; and it was not till an hour
    later that the chambermaid, surprised at seeing the door of No. 118 slightly
    ajar, had peeped in, and there was greeted by the awful sight of &ldquo;the
    maid,&rdquo; gagged, bound and unconscious.</p>
  <p>Well, I gained my wish, and had the satisfaction presently of knowing that
    Piatti&mdash;although, mind you, he emphatically denied my story from beginning
    to end&mdash;had been placed under arrest pending further inquiries.</p>
  <p>The British Consul was very kind to me; though I was not allowed to see
    my dear lady, who had been removed to the hospital. I heard that the Hungarian
    police were moving heaven and earth to find &ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rdquo; and
    bring her to justice.</p>
  <p>Her disappearance told severely against her, and after three days of such
    intense anxiety as I never wish to live through again, I received a message
    from the Consulate informing me that &ldquo;Mrs. Carey &ldquo; had been arrested
    at Als&oacute;r&eacute;v, on the Austro-Hungarian frontier, and was even
    now on her way to Budapest under escort.</p>
  <p>You may imagine how I quivered with anxiety and with rage when, on the morning
    after that welcome news, I was told that &ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rdquo; was detained
    at the gendarmerie, and had asked to see Miss Mary Granard from London, at
    present residing at the Hotel Hungaria.</p>
  <p>The impudent wretch! Wanting to see me, indeed! Well, I, too, wanted to
    see her; the woman whom I despised as a coward and a traitor; who had betrayed
    the fond and foolish trust of a stricken father; who had dashed the last
    hopes of an innocent man in danger of his life; and who, finally, had been
    the cause of an assault that had all but killed, perhaps, the woman I loved
    best in the world.</p>
  <p>I felt like the embodiment of hate and contempt. I loathed the woman, and
    I hied me in a fiacre to the gendarmerie, escorted by one of the clerks from
    the Consulate, simply thirsting with the desire to tell an ignoble female
    exactly what I thought of her.</p>
  <p>I had to wait some two or three minutes in the bare, barrack-like room of
    the gendarmerie; then the door opened, there was a rustle of silk, followed
    by the sound of measured footsteps of soldiery, and the next moment Lady
    Molly, serene and placid and, as usual, exquisitely dressed, stood smiling
    before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have got me into this plight, Mary,&rdquo; she said, with her
    merry laugh; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to get me out of it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; was all that I could gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very simple, and I&rsquo;ll explain it all fully when we are
    on our way home to Maida Vale,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For the moment you
    and Mrs. Tadworth will have to make sundry affidavits that I did not assault
    my maid nor rob her of a watch and chain. The British Consul will help you,
    and it is only a question of days, and in the meanwhile I may tell you that
    Budapest prison life is quite interesting, and not so uncomfortable as one
    would imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course, the moment she spoke I got an intuition of what had really occurred,
    and I can assure you that I was heartily ashamed that I should ever have
    doubted Lady Molly&rsquo;s cleverness in carrying through successfully so
    important, so vital a business as the righting of an innocent man.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Tadworth was pusillanimous and stupid. At Budapest she cried a halt,
    for she really felt unstrung and ill after the hurried journey, the change
    of air and food, and what not. Lady Molly, however, had no difficulty in
    persuading her that during the enforced stay of twenty-four hours at the
    Hungaria their two <i>r&ocirc;les</i> should be reversed. Lady Molly would
    be &ldquo;Mrs. Carey,&rdquo; coming from England, whilst Mrs. Tadworth would
    be the maid.</p>
  <p>My dear lady&mdash;not thinking at the time that my knowledge of this fact
    would be of any importance to her own plans&mdash;had not mentioned it to
    me during the brief interview which I had with her. Then, when Piatti arrived
    upon the scene, Mrs. Tadworth got into a real panic. Fortunately, she had
    the good sense, or the cowardice, then and there to entrust the coat and
    watch and chain to Lady Molly, and when Piatti followed her into her room
    she was able to show him that the proofs were not then in her possession.
    This was the scene which I had witnessed through the keyhole.</p>
  <p>But, of course, the Sicilian would return to the charge, and equally, of
    course, Mrs. Tadworth would sacrifice the Shuttleworths, father and son,
    to save her own skin. Lady Molly knew that. She is strong, active and determined;
    she had a brief hand-to-hand struggle with Mrs. Tadworth that night, and
    finally succeeded in tying her, half unconscious, to the bedpost, thus assuring
    herself that for at least twenty-four hours that vapid little fool would
    be unable to either act for herself or to betray my dear, intrepid lady&rsquo;s
    plans.</p>
  <p>When, the following morning, Piatti opened the door of No. 118, which had
    purposely been left on the latch, he was greeted with the sight of Mrs. Tadworth
    pinioned and half dead with fear, whilst the valuable proofs of his own guilt
    and young Shuttleworth&rsquo;s innocence had completely disappeared.</p>
  <p>For remember that Lady Molly&rsquo;s face was not known to him or to his
    gang, and she had caught the first train to Cividale even whilst Piatti still
    believed that he held that silly Mrs. Tadworth in the hollow of his hand.
    I may as well tell you here that she reached the frontier safely, and was
    quite sharp enough to seek out Colonel Grassi and, with the necessary words
    of explanation, to hand over to him the proofs of young Shuttleworth&rsquo;s
    innocence.</p>
  <p>My action in the matter helped her. At the hotel she was supposed to be
    the mistress and Mrs. Tadworth the maid, and everyone was told that &ldquo;Mrs.
    Carey&rsquo;s maid&rdquo; had been assaulted, and removed to the hospital.
    But I denounced Piatti then and there, thinking he had attacked my dear lady,
    and I got him put under lock and key so quickly that he had not the time
    to communicate with his associates.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Colonel Grassi&rsquo;s exertions, young Shuttleworth was acquitted
    of the charge of murder; but I may as well tell you here that neither Piatti
    nor his son, nor any of that gang, were arrested for the crime. The proofs
    of their guilt&mdash;the Irish-tweed coat and the murdered man&rsquo;s watch
    and chain&mdash;were most mysteriously suppressed, after young Shuttleworth&rsquo;s
    advocate had obtained the verdict of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; for him.</p>
  <p>Such is the Sicilian police. Mr. Shuttleworth, senior, evidently knew what
    he was talking about.</p>
  <p>Of course, we had no difficulty in obtaining Lady Molly&rsquo;s release.
    The British Consul saw to that. But in Budapest they still call the assault
    on  &ldquo;Mrs. Carey&rdquo; at the Hotel Hungaria a mystery, for she exonerated
    Lady Molly fully, but she refused to accuse Piatti. She was afraid of him,
    of course, and so they had to set him free.</p>
  <p>I wonder where he is now, the wicked old wretch!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheFordwychCastleMystery"></a>The Fordwych Castle Mystery</b></h2>
  <p>Can you wonder that, when some of the ablest of our fellows at the Yard
    were at their wits&rsquo; ends to know what to do, the chief instinctively
    turned to Lady Molly?</p>
  <p>Surely the Fordwych Castle Mystery, as it was universally called, was a
    case which more than any other required feminine tact, intuition, and all
    those qualities of which my dear lady possessed more than her usual share.</p>
  <p>With the exception of Mr. McKinley, the lawyer, and young Jack d&rsquo;Alboukirk,
    there were only women connected with the case.</p>
  <p>If you have studied Debrett at all, you know as well as I do that the peerage
    is one of those old English ones which date back some six hundred years,
    and that the present Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk is a baroness in her own right,
    the title and estates descending to heirs-general. If you have perused that
    same interesting volume carefully, you will also have discovered that the
    late Lord d&rsquo;Alboukirk had two daughters, the eldest, Clementina Cecilia&mdash;the
    present Baroness, who succeeded him&mdash;the other, Margaret Florence, who
    married in 1884 Jean Laurent Duplessis, a Frenchman whom Debrett vaguely
    describes as &ldquo;of Pondicherry, India,&rdquo; and of whom she had issue
    two daughters, Henriette Marie, heir now to the ancient barony of d&rsquo;Alboukirk
    of Fordwych, and Joan, born two years later.</p>
  <p>There seems to have been some mystery or romance attached to this marriage
    of the Honourable Margaret Florence d&rsquo;Alboukirk to the dashing young
    officer of the Foreign Legion. Old Lord d&rsquo;Alboukirk at the time was
    British Ambassador in Paris, and he seems to have had grave objections to
    the union, but Miss Margaret, openly flouting her father&rsquo;s displeasure,
    and throwing prudence to the winds, ran away from home one fine day with
    Captain Duplessis, and from Pondicherry wrote a curt letter to her relatives
    telling them of her marriage with the man she loved best in all the world.
    Old Lord d&rsquo;Alboukirk never got over his daughter&rsquo;s wilfulness.
    She had been his favourite, it appears, and her secret marriage and deceit
    practically broke his heart. He was kind to her, however, to the end, and
    when the first baby girl was born and the young pair seemed to be in straitened
    circumstances, he made them an allowance until the day of his daughter&rsquo;s
    death, which occurred three years after her elopement, on the birth of her
    second child.</p>
  <p>When, on the death of her father, the Honourable Clementina Cecilia came
    into the title and fortune, she seemed to have thought it her duty to take
    some interest in her late sister&rsquo;s eldest child, who, failing her own
    marriage, and issue, was heir to the barony of d&rsquo;Alboukirk. Thus it
    was that Miss Henriette Marie Duplessis came, with her father&rsquo;s consent,
    to live with her aunt at Fordwych Castle. Debrett will tell you, moreover,
    that in 1901 she assumed the name of d&rsquo;Alboukirk, in lieu of her own,
    by royal licence. Failing her, the title and estate would devolve firstly
    on her sister Joan, and subsequently on a fairly distant cousin, Captain
    John d&rsquo;Alboukirk, at present a young officer in the Guards.</p>
  <p>According to her servants, the present Baroness d&rsquo;Alboukirk is very
    self-willed, but otherwise neither more nor less eccentric than any north-country
    old maid would be who had such an exceptional position to keep up in the
    social world. The one soft trait in her otherwise not very lovable character
    is her great affection for her late sister&rsquo;s child. Miss Henriette
    Duplessis d&rsquo;Alboukirk has inherited from her French father dark eyes
    and hair and a somewhat swarthy complexion, but no doubt it is from her English
    ancestry that she has derived a somewhat masculine frame and a very great
    fondness for all outdoor pursuits. She is very athletic, knows how to fence
    and to box, rides to hounds, and is a remarkably good shot.</p>
  <p>From all accounts, the first hint of trouble in that gorgeous home was coincident
    with the arrival at Fordwych of a young, very pretty girl visitor, who was
    attended by her maid, a half-caste woman, dark-complexioned and surly of
    temper, but obviously of dog-like devotion towards her young mistress. This
    visit seems to have come as a surprise to the entire household at Fordwych
    Castle, her ladyship having said nothing about it until the very morning
    that the guests were expected. She then briefly ordered one of the housemaids
    to get a bedroom ready for a young lady, and to put up a small camp-bedstead
    in an adjoining dressing-room. Even Miss Henriette seems to have been taken
    by surprise at the announcement of this visit, for, according to Jane Taylor,
    the housemaid in question, there was a violent word-passage between the old
    lady and her niece, the latter winding up an excited speech with the words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, aunt, there won&rsquo;t be room for both of us in this
    house!&rdquo;  After which she flounced out of the room, banging the door
    behind her.</p>
  <p>Very soon the household was made to understand that the newcomer was none
    other than Miss Joan Duplessis, Miss Henriette&rsquo;s younger sister. It
    appears that Captain Duplessis had recently died in Pondicherry, and that
    the young girl then wrote to her aunt, Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk, claiming her
    help and protection, which the old lady naturally considered it her duty
    to extend to her.</p>
  <p>It appears that Miss Joan was very unlike her sister, as she was <i>petite</i> and
    fair, more English-looking than foreign, and had pretty, dainty ways which
    soon endeared her to the household. The devotion existing between her and
    the half-caste woman she had brought from India was, moreover, unique.</p>
  <p>It seems, however, that from the moment these newcomers came into the house,
    dissensions, often degenerating into violent quarrels, became the order of
    the day. Henriette seemed to have taken a strong dislike to her younger sister,
    and most particularly to the latter&rsquo;s dark attendant, who was vaguely
    known in the house as Roonah.</p>
  <p>That some events of serious import were looming ahead, the servants at Fordwych
    were pretty sure. The butler and footmen at dinner heard scraps of conversation
    which sounded very ominous. There was talk of &ldquo;lawyers,&rdquo; of &ldquo;proofs,&rdquo; of &ldquo;marriage
    and birth certificates,&rdquo; quickly suppressed when the servants happened
    to be about. Her ladyship looked terribly anxious and worried, and she and
    Miss Henriette spent long hours closeted together in a small boudoir, whence
    proceeded ominous sounds of heartrending weeping on her ladyship&rsquo;s
    part, and angry and violent words from Miss Henriette.</p>
  <p>Mr. McKinley, the eminent lawyer from London, came down two or three times
    to Fordwych, and held long conversations with her ladyship, after which the
    latter&rsquo;s eyes were very swollen and red. The household thought it more
    than strange that Roonah, the Indian servant, was almost invariably present
    at these interviews between Mr. McKinley, her ladyship, and Miss Joan. Otherwise
    the woman kept herself very much aloof; she spoke very little, hardly took
    any notice of anyone save of her ladyship and her young mistress, and the
    outbursts of Miss Henriette&rsquo;s temper seemed to leave her quite unmoved.
    A strange fact was that she had taken a sudden and great fancy for frequenting
    a small Roman Catholic convent chapel which was distant about half a mile
    from the Castle, and presently it was understood that Roonah, who had been
    a Parsee, had been converted by the attendant priest to the Roman Catholic
    faith.</p>
  <p>All this happened, mind you, within the last two or three months; in fact,
    Miss Joan had been in the Castle exactly twelve weeks when Captain Jack d&rsquo;Alboukirk
    came to pay his cousin one of his periodical visits. From the first he seems
    to have taken a great fancy to his cousin Joan, and soon everyone noticed
    that this fancy was rapidly ripening into love. It was equally certain that
    from that moment dissensions between the two sisters became more frequent
    and more violent; the generally accepted opinion being that Miss Henriette
    was jealous of Joan, whilst Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk herself, for some unexplainable
    reason, seems to have regarded this love-making with marked disfavour.</p>
  <p>Then came the tragedy.</p>
  <p>One morning Joan ran downstairs, pale, and trembling from head to foot,
    moaning and sobbing as she ran:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Roonah!&mdash;my poor old Roonah!&mdash;I knew it&mdash;I knew it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain Jack happened to meet her at the foot of the stairs. He pressed
    her with questions, but the girl was unable to speak. She merely pointed
    mutely to the floor above. The young man, genuinely alarmed, ran quickly
    upstairs; he threw open the door leading to Roonah&rsquo;s room, and there,
    to his horror, he saw the unfortunate woman lying across the small camp-bedstead,
    with a handkerchief over her nose and mouth, her throat cut.</p>
  <p>The sight was horrible.</p>
  <p>Poor Roonah was obviously dead.</p>
  <p>Without losing his presence of mind, Captain Jack quietly shut the door
    again, after urgently begging Joan to compose herself, and try to keep up,
    at any rate until the local doctor could be sent for and the terrible news
    gently broken to Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk.</p>
  <p>The doctor, hastily summoned, arrived some twenty minutes later. He could
    but confirm Joan&rsquo;s and Captain Jack&rsquo;s fears. Roonah was indeed
    dead&mdash;in fact, she had been dead some hours.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>From the very first, mind you, the public took a more than usually keen
    interest in this mysterious occurrence. The evening papers on the very day
    of the murder were ablaze with flaming headlines such as:</p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><b>THE TRAGEDY AT FORDWYCH CASTLE</b><br>
    MYSTERIOUS MURDER OF AN IMPORTANT WITNESS<br>
    GRAVE CHARGES AGAINST PERSONS IN HIGH LIFE</p>
  <p>and so forth. </p>
  <p>As time went on, the mystery deepened more and more, and I suppose Lady
    Molly must have had an inkling that sooner or later the chief would have
    to rely on her help and advice, for she sent me down to attend the inquest,
    and gave me strict orders to keep eyes and ears open for every detail in
    connection with the crime&mdash;however trivial it might seem. She herself
    remained in town, awaiting a summons from the chief.</p>
  <p>The inquest was held in the dining-room of Fordwych Castle, and the noble
    hall was crowded to its utmost when the coroner and jury finally took their
    seats, after having viewed the body of the poor murdered woman upstairs.</p>
  <p>The scene was dramatic enough to please any novelist, and an awed hush descended
    over the crowd when, just before the proceedings began, a door was thrown
    open, and in walked&mdash;stiff and erect&mdash;the Baroness d&rsquo;Alboukirk,
    escorted by her niece, Miss Henriette, and closely followed by her cousin,
    Captain Jack, of the Guards.</p>
  <p>The old lady&rsquo;s face was as indifferent and haughty as usual, and so
    was that of her athletic niece. Captain Jack, on the other hand, looked troubled
    and flushed. Everyone noted that, directly he entered the room, his eyes
    sought a small, dark figure that sat silent and immovable beside the portly
    figure of the great lawyer, Mr. Hubert McKinley. This was Miss Joan Duplessis,
    in a plain black stuff gown, her young face pale and tear-stained.</p>
  <p>Dr. Walker, the local practitioner, was, of course, the first witness called.
    His evidence was purely medical. He deposed to having made an examination
    of the body, and stated that he found that a handkerchief saturated with
    chloroform had been pressed to the woman&rsquo;s nostrils, probably while
    she was asleep, her throat having subsequently been cut with a sharp knife;
    death must have been instantaneous, as the poor thing did not appear to have
    struggled at all.</p>
  <p>In answer to a question from the coroner, the doctor said that no great
    force or violence would be required for the gruesome deed, since the victim
    was undeniably unconscious when it was done. At the same time it argued unusual
    coolness and determination.</p>
  <p>The handkerchief was produced, also the knife. The former was a bright-coloured
    one, stated to be the property of the deceased. The latter was a foreign,
    old-fashioned hunting-knife, one of a panoply of small arms and other weapons
    which adorned a corner of the hall. It had been found by Detective Elliott
    in a clump of gorse on the adjoining golf links. There could be no question
    that it had been used by the murderer for his fell purpose, since at the
    time it was found it still bore traces of blood.</p>
  <p>Captain Jack was the next witness called. He had very little to say, as
    he merely saw the body from across the room, and immediately closed the door
    again and, having begged his cousin to compose herself, called his own valet
    and sent him off for the doctor.</p>
  <p>Some of the staff of Fordwych Castle were called, all of whom testified
    to the Indian woman&rsquo;s curious taciturnity, which left her quite isolated
    among her fellow-servants. Miss Henriette&rsquo;s maid, however, Jane Partlett,
    had one or two more interesting facts to record. She seems to have been more
    intimate with the deceased woman than anyone else, and on one occasion, at
    least, had quite a confidential talk with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She talked chiefly about her mistress,&rdquo; said Jane, in answer
    to a question from the coroner, &ldquo;to whom she was most devoted. She
    told me that she loved her so, she would readily die for her. Of course,
    I thought that silly like, and just mad, foreign talk, but Roonah was very
    angry when I laughed at her, and then she undid her dress in front, and showed
    me some papers which were sown in the lining of her dress. &lsquo;All these
    papers my little missee&rsquo;s fortune,&rsquo; she said to me. &lsquo;Roonah
    guard these with her life. Someone must kill Roonah before taking them from
    her!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This was about six weeks ago,&rdquo; continued Jane, whilst a strange
    feeling of awe seemed to descend upon all those present whilst the girl spoke. &ldquo;Lately
    she became much more silent, and, on my once referring to the papers, she
    turned on me savage like and told me to hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Asked if she had mentioned the incident of the papers to anyone, Jane replied
    in the negative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except to Miss Henriette, of course,&rdquo; she added, after a slight
    moment of hesitation.</p>
  <p>Throughout all these preliminary examinations Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk, sitting
    between her cousin Captain Jack and her niece Henriette, had remained quite
    silent in an erect attitude expressive of haughty indifference. Henriette,
    on the other hand, looked distinctly bored. Once or twice she had yawned
    audibly, which caused quite a feeling of anger against her among the spectators.
    Such callousness in the midst of so mysterious a tragedy, and when her own
    sister was obviously in such deep sorrow, impressed everyone very unfavourably.
    It was well known that the young lady had had a fencing lesson just before
    the inquest in the room immediately below that where Roonah lay dead, and
    that within an hour of the discovery of the tragedy she was calmly playing
    golf.</p>
  <p>Then Miss Joan Duplessis was called.</p>
  <p>When the young girl stepped forward there was that awed hush in the room
    which usually falls upon an attentive audience when the curtain is about
    to rise on the crucial act of a dramatic play. But she was calm and self-possessed,
    and wonderfully pathetic-looking in her deep black and with the obvious lines
    of sorrow which the sad death of a faithful friend had traced on her young
    face.</p>
  <p>In answer to the coroner, she gave her name as Joan Clarissa Duplessis,
    and briefly stated that until the day of her servant&rsquo;s death she had
    been a resident at Fordwych Castle, but that since then she had left that
    temporary home, and had taken up her abode at the d&rsquo;Alboukirk Arms,
    a quiet little hostelry on the outskirts of the town.</p>
  <p>There was a distinct feeling of astonishment on the part of those who were
    not aware of this fact, and then the coroner said kindly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were born, I think, in Pondicherry, in India, and are the younger
    daughter of Captain and Mrs. Duplessis, who was own sister to her ladyship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was born in Pondicherry,&rdquo; replied the young girl, quietly, &ldquo;and
    I am the only legitimate child of the late Captain and Mrs. Duplessis, own
    sister to her ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A wave of sensation, quickly suppressed by the coroner, went through the
    crowd at these words. The emphasis which the witness had put on the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;  could
    not be mistaken, and everyone felt that here must lie the clue to the, so
    far impenetrable, mystery of the Indian woman&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>All eyes were now turned on old Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk and on her niece
    Henriette, but the two ladies were carrying on a whispered conversation together,
    and had apparently ceased to take any further interest in the proceedings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The deceased was your confidential maid, was she not?&rdquo; asked
    the coroner, after a slight pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She came over to England with you recently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; she had to accompany me in order to help me to make good my
    claim to being my late mother&rsquo;s only legitimate child, and therefore
    the heir to the barony of d&rsquo;Alboukirk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice had trembled a little as she said this, but now, as breathless
    silence reigned in the room, she seemed to make a visible effort to control
    herself, and, replying to the coroner&rsquo;s question, she gave a clear
    and satisfactory account of her terrible discovery of her faithful servant&rsquo;s
    death. Her evidence had lasted about a quarter of an hour or so, when suddenly
    the coroner put the momentous question to her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about the papers which the deceased woman carried
    about her person, and reference to which has already been made?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied quietly; &ldquo;they were the proofs relating
    to my claim. My father, Captain Duplessis, had in early youth, and before
    he met my mother, contracted a secret union with a half-caste woman, who
    was Roonah&rsquo;s own sister. Being tired of her, he chose to repudiate
    her&mdash;she had no children&mdash;but the legality of the marriage was
    never for a moment in question. After that, he married my mother, and his
    first wife subsequently died, chiefly of a broken heart; but her death only
    occurred two months after the birth of my sister Henriette. My father, I
    think, had been led to believe that his first wife had died some two years
    previously, and he was no doubt very much shocked when he realised what a
    grievous wrong he had done our mother. In order to mend matters somewhat,
    he and she went through a new form of marriage&mdash;a legal one this time&mdash;and
    my father paid a lot of money to Roonah&rsquo;s relatives to have the matter
    hushed up. Less than a year after this second&mdash;and only legal&mdash;marriage,
    I was born and my mother died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then these papers of which so much has been said&mdash;what did they
    consist of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There were the marriage certificates of my father&rsquo;s first wife&mdash;and
    two sworn statements as to her death, two months <i>after</i> the birth of
    my sister Henriette; one by Dr. R&eacute;naud, who was at the time a well-known
    medical man in Pondicherry, and the other by Roonah herself, who had held
    her dying sister in her arms. Dr. R&eacute;naud is dead, and now Roonah has
    been murdered, and all the proofs have gone with her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke in a passion of sobs, which, with manifest self-control,
    she quickly suppressed. In that crowded court you could have heard a pin
    drop, so great was the tension of intense excitement and attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then those papers remained in your maid&rsquo;s possession? Why was
    that?&rdquo;  asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not dare to carry the papers about with me,&rdquo; said the
    witness, while a curious look of terror crept into her young face as she
    looked across at her aunt and sister. &ldquo;Roonah would not part with them.
    She carried them in the lining of her dress, and at night they were all under
    her pillow. After her&mdash;her death, and when Dr. Walker had left, I thought
    it my duty to take possession of the papers which meant my whole future to
    me, and which I desired then to place in Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s charge. But,
    though I carefully searched the bed and all the clothing by my poor Roonah&rsquo;s
    side, I did not find the papers. They were gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I won&rsquo;t attempt to describe to you the sensation caused by the deposition
    of this witness. All eyes wandered from her pale young face to that of her
    sister, who sat almost opposite to her, shrugging her athletic shoulders
    and gazing at the pathetic young figure before her with callous and haughty
    indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, putting aside the question of the papers for the moment,&rdquo; said
    the coroner, after a pause, &ldquo;do you happen to know anything of your
    late servant&rsquo;s private life? Had she an enemy, or perhaps a lover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;Roonah&rsquo;s whole life was
    centred in me and in my claim. I had often begged her to place our papers
    in Mr. McKinley&rsquo;s charge, but she would trust no one. I wish she had
    obeyed me,&rdquo; here moaned the poor girl involuntarily, &ldquo;and I should
    not have lost what means my whole future to me, and the being who loved me
    best in all the world would not have been so foully murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course, it was terrible to see this young girl thus instinctively, and
    surely unintentionally, proffering so awful an accusation against those who
    stood so near to her. That the whole case had become hopelessly involved
    and mysterious, nobody could deny. Can you imagine the mental picture formed
    in the mind of all present by the story, so pathetically told, of this girl
    who had come over to England in order to make good her claim which she felt
    to be just, and who, in one fell swoop, saw that claim rendered very difficult
    to prove through the dastardly murder of her principal witness?</p>
  <p>That the claim was seriously jeopardised by the death of Roonah and the
    disappearance of the papers, was made very clear, mind you, through the statements
    of Mr. McKinley, the lawyer. He could not say very much, of course, and his
    statements could never have been taken as actual proof, because Roonah and
    Joan had never fully trusted him and had never actually placed the proofs
    of the claim in his hands. He certainly had seen the marriage certificate
    of Captain Duplessis&rsquo;s wife, and a copy of this, as he very properly
    stated, could easily be obtained. The woman seems to have died during the
    great cholera epidemic of 1881, when, owing to the great number of deaths
    which occurred, the deceit and concealment practised by the natives at Pondicherry,
    and the supineness of the French Government, death certificates were very
    casually and often incorrectly made out.</p>
  <p>Roonah had come over to England ready to swear that her sister had died
    in her arms two months after the birth of Captain Duplessis&rsquo;s eldest
    child, and there was the sworn testimony of Dr. R&eacute;naud, since dead.
    These affidavits Mr. McKinley had seen and read.</p>
  <p>Against that, the only proof which now remained of the justice of Joan Duplessis&rsquo;s
    claim was the fact that her mother and father went through a second form
    of marriage some time <i>after</i> the birth of their first child, Henriette.
    This fact was not denied, and, of course, it could be easily proved, if necessary,
    but even then it would in no way be conclusive. It implied the presence of
    a doubt in Captain Duplessis&rsquo;s mind, a doubt which the second marriage
    ceremony may have served to set at rest; but it in no way established the
    illegitimacy of his eldest daughter.</p>
  <p>In fact, the more Mr. McKinley spoke, the more convinced did everyone become
    that the theft of the papers had everything to do with the murder of the
    unfortunate Roonah. She would not part with the proofs which meant her mistress&rsquo;s
    fortune, and she paid for her devotion with her life.</p>
  <p>Several more witnesses were called after that. The servants were closely
    questioned, the doctor was recalled, but, in spite of long and arduous efforts,
    the coroner and jury could not bring a single real fact to light beyond those
    already stated.</p>
  <p>The Indian woman had been murdered!</p>
  <p>The papers which she always carried about her body had disappeared.</p>
  <p>Beyond that, nothing! An impenetrable wall of silence and mystery!</p>
  <p>The butler at Fordwych Castle had certainly missed the knife with which
    Roonah had been killed from its accustomed place on the morning after the
    murder had been committed, but not before, and the mystery further gained
    in intensity from the fact that the only purchase of chloroform in the district
    had been traced to the murdered woman herself.</p>
  <p>She had gone down to the local chemist one day some two or three weeks previously,
    and shown him a prescription for cleansing the hair which required some chloroform
    in it. He gave her a very small quantity in a tiny bottle, which was subsequently
    found empty on her own dressing-table. No one at Fordwych Castle could swear
    to having heard any unaccustomed noise during that memorable night. Even
    Joan, who slept in the room adjoining that where the unfortunate Roonah lay,
    said she had heard nothing unusual. But then, the door of communication between
    the two rooms was shut, and the murderer had been quick and silent.</p>
  <p>Thus this extraordinary inquest drew to a close, leaving in its train an
    air of dark suspicion and of unexplainable horror.</p>
  <p>The jury returned a verdict of &ldquo;Wilful murder against some person
    or persons unknown,&rdquo; and the next moment Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk rose,
    and, leaning on her niece&rsquo;s arm, quietly walked out of the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Two of our best men from the Yard, Pegram and Elliott, were left in charge
    of the case. They remained at Fordwych (the little town close by), as did
    Miss Joan, who had taken up her permanent abode at the d&rsquo;Alboukirk
    Arms, whilst I returned to town immediately after the inquest. Captain Jack
    had rejoined his regiment, and apparently the ladies of the Castle had resumed
    their quiet, luxurious life just the same as heretofore. The old lady led
    her own somewhat isolated, semi-regal life; Miss Henriette fenced and boxed,
    played hockey and golf, and over the fine Castle and its haughty inmates
    there hovered like an ugly bird of prey the threatening presence of a nameless
    suspicion.</p>
  <p>The two ladies might choose to flout public opinion, but public opinion
    was dead against them. No one dared formulate a charge, but everyone remembered
    that Miss Henriette had, on the very morning of the murder, been playing
    golf in the field where the knife was discovered, and that if Miss Joan Duplessis
    ever failed to make good her claim to the barony of d&rsquo;Alboukirk, Miss
    Henriette would remain in undisputed possession. So now, when the ladies
    drove past in the village street, no one doffed a cap to salute them, and
    when at church the parson read out the sixth commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt
    do no murder,&rdquo; all eyes gazed with fearsome awe at the old Baroness
    and her niece.</p>
  <p>Splendid isolation reigned at Fordwych Castle. The daily papers grew more
    and more sarcastic at the expense of the Scotland Yard authorities, and the
    public more and more impatient.</p>
  <p>Then it was that the chief grew desperate and sent for Lady Molly, the result
    of the interview being that I once more made the journey down to Fordwych,
    but this time in the company of my dear lady, who had received <i>carte blanche</i> from
    headquarters to do whatever she thought right in the investigation of the
    mysterious crime.</p>
  <p>She and I arrived at Fordwych at 8.0 p.m., after the usual long wait at
    Newcastle. We put up at the d&rsquo;Alboukirk Arms, and, over a hasty and
    very bad supper, Lady Molly allowed me a brief insight into her plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see every detail of that murder, Mary,&rdquo; she said earnestly,  &ldquo;just
    as if I had lived at the Castle all the time. I know exactly where our fellows
    are wrong, and why they cannot get on. But, although the chief has given
    me a free hand, what I am going to do is so irregular that if I fail I shall
    probably get my immediate <i>cong&eacute;</i>, whilst some of the disgrace
    is bound to stick to you. It is not too late&mdash;you may yet draw back,
    and leave me to act alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked her straight in the face. Her dark eyes were gleaming; there was
    the power of second sight in them, or of marvelous intuition of &ldquo;men
    and things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow your lead, my Lady Molly,&rdquo; I said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go to bed now,&rdquo; she replied, with that strange transition
    of manner which to me was so attractive and to everyone else so unaccountable.</p>
  <p>In spite of my protest, she refused to listen to any more talk or to answer
    any more questions, and, perforce, I had to go to my room. The next morning
    I saw her graceful figure, immaculately dressed in a perfect tailor-made
    gown, standing beside my bed at a very early hour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what is the time?&rdquo; I ejaculated, suddenly wide awake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too early for you to get up,&rdquo; she replied quietly. &ldquo;I
    am going to early Mass at the Roman Catholic convent close by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Mass at the Roman Catholic convent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t repeat all my words, Mary; it is silly, and wastes
    time. I have introduced myself in the neighbourhood as the American, Mrs.
    Silas A. Ogen, whose motor has broken down and is being repaired at Newcastle,
    while I, its owner, amuse myself by viewing the beauties of the neighbourhood.
    Being a Roman Catholic, I go to Mass first, and, having met Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk
    once in London, I go to pay her a respectful visit afterwards. When I come
    back we will have breakfast together. You might try in the meantime to scrape
    up an acquaintance with Miss Joan Duplessis, who is still staying here, and
    ask her to join us at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was gone before I could make another remark, and I could but obey her
    instantly to the letter.</p>
  <p>An hour later I saw Miss Joan Duplessis strolling in the hotel garden. It
    was not difficult to pass the time of day with the young girl, who seemed
    quite to brighten up at having someone to talk to. We spoke of the weather
    and so forth, and I steadily avoided the topic of the Fordwych Castle tragedy
    until the return of Lady Molly at about ten o&rsquo;clock. She came back
    looking just as smart, just as self-possessed, as when she had started three
    hours earlier. Only I, who knew her so well, noted the glitter of triumph
    in her eyes, and knew that she had not failed. She was accompanied by Pegram,
    who, however, immediately left her side and went straight into the hotel,
    whilst she joined us in the garden, and, after a few graceful words, introduced
    herself to Miss Joan Duplessis and asked her to join us in the coffee-room
    upstairs.</p>
  <p>The room was empty and we sat down to table, I quivering with excitement
    and awaiting events. Through the open window I saw Elliott walking rapidly
    down the village street. Presently the waitress went off, and I being too
    excited to eat or speak, Lady Molly carried on a running conversation with
    Miss Joan, asking her about her life in India and her father, Captain Duplessis.
    Joan admitted that she had always been her father&rsquo;s favourite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never liked Henriette, somehow,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly asked her when she had first known Roonah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She came to the house when my mother died,&rdquo; replied Joan, &ldquo;and
    she had charge of me as a baby.&rdquo; At Pondicherry no one had thought
    it strange that she came as a servant into an officer&rsquo;s house where
    her own sister had reigned as mistress. Pondicherry is a French settlement,
    and manners and customs there are often very peculiar.</p>
  <p>I ventured to ask her what were her future plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, with a great touch of sadness, &ldquo;I can,
    of course, do nothing whilst my aunt is alive. I cannot force her to let
    me live at Fordwych or to acknowledge me as her heir. After her death, if
    my sister does assume the title and fortune of d&rsquo;Alboukirk,&rdquo; she
    added, whilst suddenly a strange look of vengefulness&mdash;almost of hatred
    and cruelty&mdash;marred the child-like expression of her face, &ldquo;then
    I shall revive the story of the tragedy of Roonah&rsquo;s death, and I hope
    that public opinion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused here in her speech, and I, who had been gazing out of the window,
    turned my eyes on her. She was ashy-pale, staring straight before her; her
    hands dropped the knife and fork which she had held. Then I saw that Pegram
    had come into the room, that he had come up to the table and placed a packet
    of papers in Lady Molly&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page100.jpg" width="514" height="750"></p>
  <p>I saw it all as in a flash!</p>
  <p>There was a loud cry of despair like an animal at bay, a shrill cry, followed
    by a deep one from Pegram of &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and before
    anyone could prevent her, Joan&rsquo;s graceful young figure stood outlined
    for a short moment at the open window.</p>
  <p>The next moment she had disappeared into the depth below, and we heard a
    dull thud which nearly froze the blood in my veins.</p>
  <p>Pegram ran out of the room, but Lady Molly sat quite still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have succeeded in clearing the innocent,&rdquo; she said quietly; &ldquo;but
    the guilty has meted out to herself her own punishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it was she?&rdquo; I murmured, horror-struck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I suspected it from the first,&rdquo; replied Lady Molly calmly. &ldquo;It
    was this conversion of Roonah to Roman Catholicism and her consequent change
    of manner which gave me the first clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why&mdash;why?&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A simple reason, Mary,&rdquo; she rejoined, tapping the packet of
    papers with her delicate hand; and, breaking open the string that held the
    letters, she laid them out upon the table. &ldquo;The whole thing was a fraud
    from beginning to end. The woman&rsquo;s marriage certificate was all right,
    of course, but I mistrusted the genuineness of the other papers from the
    moment that I heard that Roonah would not part with them and would not allow
    Mr. McKinley to have charge of them. I am sure that the idea at first was
    merely one of blackmail. The papers were only to be the means of extorting
    money from the old lady, and there was no thought of taking them into court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Roonah&rsquo;s part was, of course, the important thing in the whole
    case, since she was here prepared to swear to the actual date of the first
    Madame Duplessis&rsquo;s death. The initiative, of course, may have come
    either from Joan or from Captain Duplessis himself, out of hatred for the
    family who would have nothing to do with him and his favourite younger daughter.
    That, of course, we shall never know. At first Roonah was a Parsee, with
    a dog-like devotion to the girl whom she had nursed as a baby, and who no
    doubt had drilled her well into the part she was to play. But presently she
    became a Roman Catholic&mdash;an ardent convert, remember, with all a Roman
    Catholic&rsquo;s fear of hell-fire. I went to the convent this morning. I
    heard the priest&rsquo;s sermon there, and I realised what an influence his
    eloquence must have had over poor, ignorant, superstitious Roonah. She was
    still ready to die for her young mistress, but she was no longer prepared
    to swear to a lie for her sake. After Mass I called at Fordwych Castle. I
    explained my position to old Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk, who took me into the
    room where Roonah had slept and died. There I found two things,&rdquo;  continued
    Lady Molly, as she opened the elegant reticule which still hung upon her
    arm, and placed a big key and a prayer-book before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The key I found in a drawer of an old cupboard in the dressing-room
    where Roonah slept, with all sorts of odds and ends belonging to the unfortunate
    woman, and going to the door which led into what had been Joan&rsquo;s bedroom,
    I found that it was locked, and that this key fitted into the lock. Roonah
    had locked that door herself on her own side&mdash;<i>she was afraid of her
    mistress.</i> I knew now that I was right in my surmise. The prayer-book
    is a Roman Catholic one. It is heavily thumbmarked there, where false oaths
    and lying are denounced as being deadly sins for which hell-fire would be
    the punishment. Roonah, terrorised by fear of the supernatural, a new convert
    to the faith, was afraid of committing a deadly sin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who knows what passed between the two women, both of whom have come
    to so violent and terrible an end? Who can tell what prayers, tears, persuasions
    Joan Duplessis employed from the time she realised that Roonah did not mean
    to swear to the lie which would have brought her mistress wealth and glamour
    until the awful day when she finally understood that Roonah would no longer
    even hold her tongue, and devised a terrible means of silencing her for ever?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With this certainty before me, I ventured on my big <i>coup</i>.
    I was so sure, you see. I kept Joan talking in here whilst I sent Pegram
    to her room with orders to break open the locks of her hand-bag and dressing-case.
    There!&mdash;I told you that if I was wrong I would probably be dismissed
    the force for irregularity, as of course I had no right to do that; but if
    Pegram found the papers there where I felt sure they would be, we could bring
    the murderer to justice. I know my own sex pretty well, don&rsquo;t I, Mary?
    I knew that Joan Duplessis had not destroyed&mdash;never would destroy&mdash;those
    papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page106.jpg" width="513" height="750"></p>
  <p>Even as Lady Molly spoke we could hear heavy tramping outside the passage.
    I ran to the door, and there was met by Pegram.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is quite dead, miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a drop of
    forty feet, and a stone pavement down below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The guilty had indeed meted out her own punishment to herself!</p>
  <p>Lady d&rsquo;Alboukirk sent Lady Molly a cheque for &pound;5,000 the day
    the whole affair was made known to the public.</p>
  <p>I think you will say that it had been well earned. With her own dainty hands
    my dear lady had lifted the veil which hung over the tragedy of Fordwych
    Castle, and with the finding of the papers in Joan Duplessis&rsquo;s dressing-bag,
    and the unfortunate girl&rsquo;s suicide, the murder of the Indian woman
    was no longer a mystery.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADaysFolly"></a>A Day&rsquo;s Folly</b></h2>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone ever knew that the real eludication of the
    extraordinary mystery known to the newspaper-reading public as the &ldquo;Somersetshire
    Outrage&rdquo; was evolved in my own dear lady&rsquo;s quick, intuitive brain.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, to this day&mdash;as far as the public is concerned&mdash;the
    Somersetshire outrage never was properly explained; and it is a very usual
    thing for those busybodies who are so fond of criticising the police to point
    to that case as an instance of remarkable incompetence on the part of our
    detective department.</p>
  <p>A young woman named Jane Turner, a visitor at Weston-super-Mare, had been
    discovered one afternoon in a helpless condition, bound and gagged, and suffering
    from terror and inanition, in the bedroom which she occupied in a well-known
    apartment-house of that town. The police had been immediately sent for, and
    as soon as Miss Turner had recovered she gave what explanation she could
    of the mysterious occurrence.</p>
  <p>She was employed in one of the large drapery shops in Bristol, and was spending
    her annual holiday at Weston-super-Mare. Her father was the local butcher
    at Banwell&mdash;a village distant about four miles from Weston&mdash;and
    it appears that somewhere near one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of Friday,
    the 3rd of September, she was busy in her bedroom putting a few things together
    in a handbag, preparatory to driving out to Banwell, meaning to pay her parents
    a week-end visit.</p>
  <p>There was a knock at her door, and a voice said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Jane&mdash;may
    I come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not recognise the voice, but somehow thought that it must be that
    of a friend, so she shouted, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was all that the poor thing recollected definitely, for the next moment
    the door was thrown open, someone rushed at her with amazing violence, she
    heard the crash of a falling table and felt a blow on the side of her head,
    whilst a damp handkerchief was pressed to her nose and mouth.</p>
  <p>Then she remembered nothing more.</p>
  <p>When she gradually came to her senses she found herself in the terrible
    plight in which Mrs. Skeward&mdash;her landlady&mdash;discovered her twenty-four
    hours later.</p>
  <p>When pressed to try and describe her assailant, she said that when the door
    was thrown open she thought that she saw an elderly woman in a wide mantle
    and wearing bonnet and veil, but that, at the same time, she was quite sure,
    from the strength and brutality of the onslaught, that she was attacked by
    a man. She had no enemies, and no possessions worth stealing; but her hand-bag,
    which, however, only contained a few worthless trifles, had certainly disappeared.</p>
  <p>The people of the house, on the other hand, could throw but little light
    on the mystery which surrounded this very extraordinary and seemingly purposeless
    assault.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Skeward only remembered that on Friday Miss Turner told her that she
    was just off to Banwell, and would be away for the week-end; but that she
    wished to keep her room on, against her return on the Monday following.</p>
  <p>That was somewhere about half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock, at the hour when
    luncheons were being got ready for the various lodgers; small wonder, therefore,
    that no one in the busy apartment-house took much count of the fact that
    Miss Turner was not seen to leave the house after that, and no doubt the
    wretched girl would have been left for several days in the pitiable condition
    in which she was ultimately found but for the fact that Mrs. Skeward happened
    to be of the usual grasping type common to those of her kind.</p>
  <p>Weston-super-Mare was over-full that week-end, and Mrs. Skeward, beset by
    applicants for accommodation, did not see why she should not let her absent
    lodger&rsquo;s room for the night or two that the latter happened to be away,
    and thus get money twice over for it.</p>
  <p>She conducted a visitor up to Miss Turner&rsquo;s room on the Saturday afternoon,
    and, throwing open the door&mdash;which, by the way, was not locked&mdash;was
    horrified to see the poor girl half-sitting, half-slipping off the chair
    to which she had been tied with a rope, whilst a woolen shawl was wound round
    the lower part of her face.</p>
  <p>As soon as she had released the unfortunate victim, Mrs. Skeward sent for
    the police, and it was through the intelligent efforts of Detective Parsons&mdash;a
    local man&mdash;that a few scraps of very hazy evidence were then and there
    collected.</p>
  <p>First, there was the question of the elderly female in the wide mantle,
    spoken of by Jane Turner as her assailant. It seems that someone answering
    to that description had called on the Friday at about one o&rsquo;clock,
    and asked to see Miss Turner. The maid who answered the door replied that
    she thought Miss Turner had gone to Banwell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the old dame, &ldquo;she won&rsquo;t have started
    yet. I am Miss Turner&rsquo;s mother, and I was to call for her so that we
    might drive out together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Miss Turner is still in her room,&rdquo; suggested
    the maid.  &ldquo;Shall I go and see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble,&rdquo; replied the woman; &ldquo;I know my way.
    I&rsquo;ll go myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon the old dame walked past the servant, crossed the hall and went
    upstairs. No one saw her come down again, but one of the lodgers seems to
    have heard a knock at Jane Turner&rsquo;s door, and the female voice saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    me, Jane&mdash;may I come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What happened subsequently, who the mysterious old female was, and how and
    for what purpose she assaulted Jane Turner and robbed her of a few valueless
    articles, was the puzzle which faced the police then, and which&mdash;so
    far as the public is concerned&mdash;has never been solved. Jane Turner&rsquo;s
    mother was in bed at the time suffering from a broken ankle and unable to
    move. The elderly woman was, therefore, an impostor, and the search after
    her&mdash;though keen and hot enough at the time, I assure you&mdash;has
    remained, in the eyes of the public, absolutely fruitless. But of this more
    anon.</p>
  <p>On the actual scene of the crime there was but little to guide subsequent
    investigation. The rope with which Jane Turner had been pinioned supplied
    no clue; the wool shawl was Miss Turner&rsquo;s own, snatched up by the miscreant
    to smother the girl&rsquo;s screams; on the floor was a handkerchief, without
    initial or laundry mark, which obviously had been saturated with chloroform;
    and close by a bottle which had contained the an&aelig;sthetic. A small table
    was overturned, and the articles which had been resting upon it were lying
    all around&mdash;such as a vase which had held a few flowers, a box of biscuits,
    and several issues of the <i>West of England Times.</i></p>
  <p>And nothing more. The miscreant, having accomplished his fell purpose, succeeded
    evidently in walking straight out of the house unobserved; his exit being
    undoubtedly easily managed owing to it being the busy luncheon hour.</p>
  <p>Various theories were, of course, put forward by some of our ablest fellows
    at the Yard; the most likely solution being the guilt or, at least, the complicity
    of the girl&rsquo;s sweetheart, Arthur Cutbush&mdash;a ne&rsquo;er-do-well,
    who spent the greater part of his time on race-courses. Inspector Danvers,
    whom the chief had sent down to assist the local police, declared that Jane
    Turner herself suspected her sweetheart, and was trying to shield him by
    stating she possessed nothing of any value; whereas, no doubt, the young
    blackguard knew that she had some money, and had planned this amazing <i>coup</i> in
    order to rob her of it.</p>
  <p>Danvers was quite chagrined when, on investigation, it was proved that Arthur
    Cutbush had gone to the York races three days before the assault, and never
    left that city until the Saturday evening, when a telegram from Miss Turner
    summoned him to Weston.</p>
  <p>Moreover, the girl did not break off her engagement with young Cutbush,
    and thus the total absence of motive was a serious bar to the likelihood
    of the theory.</p>
  <p>Then it was the Chief sent for Lady Molly. No doubt he began to feel that
    here, too, was a case where feminine tact and my lady&rsquo;s own marvellous
    intuition might prove more useful than the more approved methods of the sterner
    sex.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, there is a woman in the case, Mary,&rdquo; said Lady Molly
    to me, when she came home from the interview with the chief, &ldquo;although
    they all pooh-pooh that theory at the Yard, and declare that the female voice&mdash;to
    which the only two witnesses we have are prepared to swear&mdash;was a disguised
    one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think, then, that a woman assaulted Jane Turner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied somewhat evasively, &ldquo;if a man assumes
    a feminine voice, the result is a high-pitched, unnatural treble; and that,
    I feel convinced, would have struck either the maid or the lodger, or both,
    as peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was the train of thought which my dear lady and I were following up,
    when, with that sudden transition of manner so characteristic of her, she
    said abruptly to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, look out a train for Weston-super-Mare. We must try to get
    down there to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chief&rsquo;s orders?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;mine,&rdquo; she replied laconically. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
    the A B C?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, we got off that self-same afternoon, and in the evening we were having
    dinner at the Grand Hotel, Weston-super-Mare.</p>
  <p>My dear lady had been pondering all through the journey, and even now she
    was singularly silent and absorbed. There was a deep frown between her eyes,
    and every now and then the luminous, dark orbs would suddenly narrow, and
    the pupils contract as if smitten with a sudden light.</p>
  <p>I was not a little puzzled as to what was going on in that active brain
    of hers, but my experience was that silence on my part was the surest card
    to play.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly had entered our names in the hotel book as Mrs. Walter Bell and
    Miss Granard from London; and the day after our arrival there came two heavy
    parcels for her under that name. She had them taken upstairs to our private
    sitting-room, and there we undid them together.</p>
  <p>To my astonishment they contained stacks of newspapers: as far as I could
    see at a glance, back numbers of the <i>West of England Times</i> covering
    a whole year.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find and cut out the &lsquo;Personal&rsquo; column of every number,
    Mary,&rdquo; said Lady Molly to me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look through them on
    my return. I am going for a walk, and will be home by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew, of course, that she was intent on her business and on that only,
    and as soon as she had gone out I set myself to the wearisome task which
    she had allotted me. My dear lady was evidently working out a problem in
    her mind, the solution of which she expected to find in a back number of
    the <i>West of England Times</i>.</p>
  <p>By the time she returned I had the &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; column of some
    three hundred numbers of the paper neatly filed and docketed for her perusal.
    She thanked me for my promptitude with one of her charming looks, but said
    little, if anything, all through luncheon. After that meal she set to work.
    I could see her studying each scrap of paper minutely, comparing one with
    the other, arranging them in sets in front of her, and making marginal notes
    on them all the while.</p>
  <p>With but a brief interval for tea, she sat at her table for close on four
    hours, at the end of which she swept all the scraps of paper on one side,
    with the exception of a few which she kept in her hand. Then she looked up
    at me, and I sighed with relief.</p>
  <p>My dear lady was positively beaming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have found what you wanted?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I expected,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spread out the bits of paper before me. There were six altogether, and
    each of these columns had one paragraph specially marked with a cross.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only look at the paragraphs which I have marked,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>I did what I was told. But if in my heart I had vaguely hoped that I should
    then and there be confronted with the solution of the mystery which surrounded
    the Somersetshire outrage, I was doomed to disappointment.</p>
  <p>Each of the marked paragraphs in the &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; columns bore
    the initials H. S. H., and their purport was invariably an assignation at
    one of the small railway stations on the line between Bristol and Weston.</p>
  <p>I suppose that my bewilderment must have been supremely comical, for my
    lady&rsquo;s rippling laugh went echoing through the bare, dull hotel sitting-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see it, Mary?&rdquo; she asked gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It completely baffles
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said more gravely, &ldquo;those few silly paragraphs
    have given me the clue to the mysterious assault on Jane Turner, which has
    been puzzling our fellows at the Yard for over three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will, Mary, directly we get back to town. During my morning walk
    I have learnt all that I want to know, and now these paragraphs have set
    my mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The next day we were back in town.</p>
  <p>Already, at Bristol, we had bought a London morning paper, which contained
    in its centre page a short notice under the following startling headlines:</p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><b>THE SOMERSETSHIRE OUTRAGE</b><br>
  AMAZING DISCOVERY BY THE POLICE<br>
  AN UNEXPECTED CLUE</p>
  <p>The article went on to say:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We are officially informed that the police have recently obtained
    knowledge of certain facts which establish beyond a doubt the motive of the
    brutal assault committed on the person of Miss Jane Turner. We are not authorised
    to say more at present than that certain startling developments are imminent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the way up my dear lady had initiated me into some of her views with
    regard to the case itself, which at the chief&rsquo;s desire she had now
    taken entirely in hand, and also into her immediate plans, of which the above
    article was merely the preface.</p>
  <p>She it was who had &ldquo;officially informed&rdquo; the Press Association,
    and, needless to say, the news duly appeared in most of the London and provincial
    dailies.</p>
  <p>How unerring was her intuition, and how well thought out her scheme, was
    proved within the next four-and-twenty hours in our own little flat, when
    our Emily, looking somewhat important and awed, announced Her Serene Highness
    the Countess of Hohengebirg.</p>
  <p>H. S. H.&mdash;the conspicuous initials in the &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; columns
    of the <i>West of England Times</i>! You may imagine how I stared at the
    exquisite apparition&mdash;all lace and chiffon and roses&mdash;which the
    next moment literally swept into our office, past poor, open-mouthed Emily.</p>
  <p>Had my dear lady taken leave of her senses when she suggested that this
    beautiful young woman with the soft, fair hair, with the pleading blue eyes
    and childlike mouth, had anything to do with a brutal assault on a shop girl?</p>
  <p>The young Countess shook hands with Lady Molly and with me, and then, with
    a deep sigh, she sank into the comfortable chair which I was offering her.</p>
  <p>Speaking throughout with great diffidence, but always in the gentle tones
    of a child that knows it has been naughty, she began by explaining that she
    had been to Scotland Yard, where a very charming man&mdash;the chief, I presume&mdash;had
    been most kind and sent her hither, where he promised her she would find
    help and consolation in her dreadful, dreadful trouble.</p>
  <p>Encouraged by Lady Molly, she soon plunged into her narrative: a pathetic
    tale of her own frivolity and foolishness.</p>
  <p>She was originally Lady Muriel Wolfe-Strongham, daughter of the Duke of
    Weston, and when scarce out of the schoolroom had met the Grand Duke of Starkburg-Nauheim,
    who fell in love with her and married her. The union was a morganatic one,
    the Grand Duke conferring on his English wife the title of the Countess of
    Hohengebirg and the rank of Serene Highness.</p>
  <p>It seems that, at first, the marriage was a fairly happy one, in spite of
    the bitter animosity of the mother and sister of the Grand Duke: the Dowager
    Grand Duchess holding that all English girls were loud and unwomanly, and
    the Princess Amalie, seeing in her brother&rsquo;s marriage a serious bar
    to the fulfilment of her own highly ambitious matrimonial hopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t bear me, because I don&rsquo;t knit socks and don&rsquo;t
    know how to bake almond cakes,&rdquo; said her dear little Serene Highness,
    looking up with tender appeal at Lady Molly&rsquo;s grave and beautiful face; &ldquo;and
    they will be so happy to see a real estrangement between my husband and myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It appears that last year, while the Grand Duke was doing his annual cure
    at Marienbad, the Countess of Hohengebirg went to Folkestone for the benefit
    of her little boy&rsquo;s health. She stayed at one of the Hotels there merely
    as any English lady of wealth might do&mdash;with nurses and her own maid,
    of course, but without the paraphernalia and nuisance of her usual German
    retinue.</p>
  <p>Whilst there she met an old acquaintance of her father&rsquo;s, a Mr. Rumboldt,
    who is a rich financier, it seems, and who at one time moved in the best
    society, but whose reputation had greatly suffered recently, owing to a much
    talked of divorce case which brought his name into unenviable notoriety.</p>
  <p>Her Serene Highness, with more mopping of her blue eyes, assured Lady Molly
    that over at Schloss Starkburg she did not read the English papers, and was
    therefore quite unaware that Mr. Rumboldt, who used to be a <i>persona grata</i> in
    her father&rsquo;s house, was no longer a fit and proper acquaintance for
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a very fine morning,&rdquo; she continued with gentle pathos, &ldquo;and
    I was deadly dull at Folkestone. Mr. Rumboldt persuaded me to go with him
    on a short trip on his yacht. We were to cross over to Boulogne, have luncheon
    there, and come home in the cool of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, of course, something occurred to disable the yacht,&rdquo; concluded
    Lady Molly gravely, as the lady herself had paused in her narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; whispered the little Countess through her tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, of course, it was too late to get back by the ordinary afternoon
    mail boat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That boat had gone an hour before, and the next did not leave until
    the middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you had perforce to wait until then, and in the meanwhile you
    were seen by a girl named Jane Turner, who knew you by sight, and who has
    been blackmailing you ever since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you guess that?&rdquo; ejaculated Her Highness, with a look
    of such comical bewilderment in her large, blue eyes that Lady Molly and
    I had perforce to laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied my dear lady after awhile, resuming her gravity, &ldquo;we
    have a way in our profession of putting two and two together, haven&rsquo;t
    we? And in this case it was not very difficult. The assignations for secret
    meetings at out-of-the-way railway stations which were addressed to H. S.
    H. in the columns of the <i>West of England Times</i> recently, gave me one
    clue, shall we say? The mysterious assault on a young woman, whose home was
    close to those very railway stations as well as to Bristol Castle&mdash;your
    parents&rsquo; residence, where you have frequently been staying of late,
    was another piece that fitted in the puzzle; whilst the number of copies
    of the <i>West of England Times</i> that were found in that same young woman&rsquo;s
    room helped to draw my thoughts to her. Then your visit to me to-day&mdash;it
    is very simple, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said H. S. H. with a sigh. &ldquo;Only it is
    worse even than you suggest, for that horrid Jane Turner, to whom I had been
    ever so kind when I was a girl, took a snapshot of me and Mr. Rumboldt standing
    on the steps of H&ocirc;tel des Bains at Boulogne. I saw her doing it and
    rushed down the steps to stop her. She talked quite nicely then&mdash;hypocritical
    wretch!&mdash;and said that perhaps the plate would be no good when it was
    developed, and if it were she would destroy it. I was not to worry; she would
    contrive to let me know through the agony column of the <i>West of England
    Times</i>, which&mdash;as I was going home to Bristol Castle to stay with
    my parents&mdash;I could see every day, but she had no idea I should have
    minded, and all that sort of rigmarole. Oh! she is a wicked girl, isn&rsquo;t
    she, to worry me so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And once again the lace handkerchief found its way to the most beautiful
    pair of blue eyes I think I have ever seen. I could not help smiling, though
    I was really very sorry for the silly, emotional, dear little thing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And instead of reassurance in the <i>West of England Times</i>, you
    found a demand for a secret meeting at a country railway station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! And when I went there&mdash;terrified lest I should be seen&mdash;Jane
    Turner did not meet me herself. Her mother came and at once talked of selling
    the photograph to my husband or to my mother-in-law. She said it was worth
    four thousand pounds to Jane, and that she had advised her daughter not to
    sell it to me for less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you reply?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I hadn&rsquo;t got four thousand pounds,&rdquo; said the Countess
    ruefully;  &ldquo;so after a lot of argument it was agreed that I was to
    pay Jane two hundred and fifty pounds a year out of my dress allowance. She
    would keep the negative as security, but promised never to let anyone see
    it so long as she got her money regularly. It was also arranged that whenever
    I stayed with my parents at Bristol Castle, Jane would make appointments
    to meet me through the columns of the <i>West of England Times</i>, and I
    was to pay up the instalments then just as she directed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I could have laughed, if the whole thing had not been so tragic, for truly
    the way this silly, harmless little woman had allowed herself to be bullied
    and blackmailed by a pair of grasping females was beyond belief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this has been going on for over a year,&rdquo; commented Lady
    Molly gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I never met Jane Turner again: it was always her mother
    who came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You knew her mother before that, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I only knew Jane because she had been sewing-maid at the
    Castle some few years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lady Molly slowly. &ldquo;What was the woman like
    whom you used to meet at the railway stations, and to whom you paid over
    Miss Turner&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what she was like. I never saw her
    properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never saw her properly?&rdquo; ejaculated Lady Molly, and it seemed
    to my well-trained ears as if there was a ring of exultation in my dear lady&rsquo;s
    voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the little Countess ruefully. &ldquo;She always
    appointed a late hour of the evening, and those little stations on that line
    are very badly lighted. I had such difficulties getting away from home without
    exciting comment, and used to beg her to let me meet her at a more convenient
    hour. But she always refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly remained thoughtful for a while; then she asked abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you prosecute Jane Turner for blackmail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare not&mdash;I dare not!&rdquo; ejaculated the little Countess,
    in genuine terror. &ldquo;My husband would never forgive me, and his female
    relations would do their best afterwards to widen the breach between us.
    It was because of the article in the London newspaper about the assault on
    Jane Turner&mdash;the talk of a clue and of startling developments&mdash;that
    I got terrified, and went to Scotland Yard. Oh, no! no! no! Promise me that
    my name won&rsquo;t be dragged into this case. It would ruin me for ever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was sobbing now; her grief and fear were very pathetic to witness, and
    she moaned through her sobs:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those wicked people know that I daren&rsquo;t risk an exposure, and
    simply prey on me like vampires because of that. The last time I saw the
    old woman I told her that I would confess everything to my husband&mdash;I
    couldn&rsquo;t bear to go on like this. But she only laughed; she knew I
    should never dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About three weeks ago&mdash;just before Jane Turner was assaulted
    and robbed of the photographs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know she was robbed of the photographs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She wrote and told me so,&rdquo; replied the young Countess, who
    seemed strangely awed now by my dear lady&rsquo;s earnest question. And from
    a dainty reticule she took a piece of paper, which bore traces of many bitter
    tears on its crumpled surface. This she handed to Lady Molly, who took it
    from her. It was a type-written letter, which bore no signature. Lady Molly
    perused it in silence first, then read its contents out aloud to me:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To H. S. H. the Countess of Hohengebirg.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think I have been worrying you the past twelve months about your
    adventure with Mr. Rumboldt in Boulogne. But it was not me; it was one who
    has power over me, and who knew about the photograph. He made me act as I
    did. But whilst I kept the photo you were safe. Now he has assaulted me and
    nearly killed me, and taken the negative away. I can, and will, get it out
    of him again, but it will mean a large sum down. Can you manage one thousand
    pounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you get this?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only a few days ago,&rdquo; replied the Countess. &ldquo;And oh!
    I have been enduring agonies of doubt and fear for the past three weeks,
    for I had heard nothing from Jane since the assault, and I wondered what
    had happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not sent a reply, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I was going to, when I saw the article in the London paper, and
    the fear that all had been discovered threw me into such a state of agony
    that I came straight up to town and saw the gentleman at Scotland Yard, who
    sent me on to you. Oh!&rdquo; she entreated again and again, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t
    do anything that will cause a scandal! Promise me&mdash;promise me! I believe
    I should commit suicide rather than face it&mdash;and I could find a thousand
    pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need do either,&rdquo; said Lady Molly. &ldquo;Now,
    may I think over the whole matter quietly to myself,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and
    talk it over with my friend here? I may be able to let you have some good
    news shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page128.jpg" width="481" height="750"></p>
  <p>She rose, intimating kindly that the interview was over. But it was by no
    means that yet, for there was still a good deal of entreaty and a great many
    tears on the one part, and reiterated kind assurances on the other. However
    when, some ten minutes later, the dainty clouds of lace and chiffon were
    finally wafted out of our office, we both felt that the poor, harmless, unutterably
    foolish little lady looked distinctly consoled and more happy than she had
    been for the past twelve months.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! she has been an utter little goose,&rdquo; Lady Molly was saying
    to me an hour later when we were having luncheon; &ldquo;but that Jane Turner
    is a remarkably clever girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you think, as I do, that the mysterious elderly female,
    who seems to have impersonated the mother all through, was an accomplice
    of Jane Turner&rsquo;s, and that the assault was a put-up job between them,&rdquo; I
    said. &ldquo;Inspector Danvers will be delighted&mdash;for this theory is
    a near approach to his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; was all the comment vouchsafed on my remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure it was Arthur Cutbush, the girl&rsquo;s sweetheart, after
    all,&rdquo;  I retorted hotly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see that, put to the
    test of sworn evidence, his alibi at the time of the assault itself won&rsquo;t
    hold good. Moreover, now,&rdquo; I added triumphantly,  &ldquo;we have knowledge
    which has been lacking all along&mdash;the motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my lady, smiling at my enthusiasm, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    how you argue, Mary, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and in my opinion the only question in doubt is whether Arthur
    Cutbush acted in collusion with Jane Turner or against her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we go and elucidate that point&mdash;and some others&mdash;at
    once,&rdquo;  concluded Lady Molly as she rose from the table.</p>
  <p>She decided to return to Bristol that same evening. We were going by the
    8.50 p.m., and I was just getting ready&mdash;the cab being already at the
    door&mdash;when I was somewhat startled by the sudden appearance into my
    room of an old lady, very beautifully dressed, with snow-white hair dressed
    high above a severe, interesting face.</p>
  <p>A merry, rippling laugh issuing from the wrinkled mouth, and a closer scrutiny
    on my part, soon revealed the identity of my dear lady, dressed up to look
    like an extremely dignified <i>grande dame</i> of the old school, whilst
    a pair of long, old-fashioned earrings gave a curious, foreign look to her
    whole appearance.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t quite see why she chose to arrive at the Grand Hotel, Bristol,
    in that particular disguise, nor why she entered our names in the hotel book
    as Grand Duchess and Princess Amalie von Starkburg, from Germany; nor did
    she tell me anything that evening.</p>
  <p>But by the next afternoon, when we drove out together in a fly, I was well
    up in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which I had to play. My lady had made me dress
    in a very rich black silk dress of her own, and ordered me to do my hair
    in a somewhat frumpish fashion, with a parting, and a &ldquo;bun&rdquo; at
    the back. She herself looked more like Royalty travelling incognito than
    ever, and no wonder small children and tradesmen&rsquo;s boys stared open-mouthed
    when we alighted from our fly outside one of the mean-looking little houses
    in Bread Street.</p>
  <p>In answer to our ring, a smutty little servant opened the door, and my lady
    asked her if Miss Jane Turner lived here and if she were in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Turner lives here, and it bein&rsquo; Thursday and early
    closin&rsquo;  she&rsquo;s home from business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then please tell her,&rdquo; said Lady Molly in her grandest manner, &ldquo;that
    the Dowager Grand Duchess of Starkburg-Nauheim and the Princess Amalie desire
    to see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The poor little maid nearly fell backwards with astonishment. She gasped
    an agitated &ldquo;Lor!&rdquo; and then flew down the narrow passage and
    up the steep staircase, closely followed by my dear lady and myself.</p>
  <p>On the first-floor landing the girl, with nervous haste, knocked at a door,
    opened it and muttered half audibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ladies to see you, miss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she fled incontinently upstairs. I have never been able to decide whether
    that little girl thought that we were lunatics, ghosts, or criminals.</p>
  <p>But already Lady Molly had sailed into the room, where Miss Jane Turner
    apparently had been sitting reading a novel. She jumped up when we entered,
    and stared open-eyed at the gorgeous apparitions. She was not a bad-looking
    girl but for the provoking, bold look in her black eyes, and the general
    slatternly appearance of her person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray do not disturb yourself, Miss Turner,&rdquo; said Lady Molly
    in broken English, as she sank into a chair, and beckoned me to do likewise. &ldquo;Pray
    sit down&mdash;I vill be brief. You have a compromising photograph&mdash;is
    it not?&mdash;of my daughter-in-law ze Countess of Hohengebirg. I am ze Grand
    Duchess of Starkburg-Nauheim&mdash;zis is my daughter, ze Princess Amalie.
    We are here incognito. You understand? Not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, with inimitable elegance of gesture, my dear lady raised a pair of &ldquo;starers&rdquo; to
    her eyes and fixed them on Jane Turner&rsquo;s quaking figure.</p>
  <p>Never had I seen suspicion, nay terror, depicted so plainly on a young face,
    but I will do the girl the justice to state that she pulled herself together
    with marvellous strength of will.</p>
  <p>She fought down her awed respect of this great lady; or rather shall I say
    that the British middle-class want of respect for social superiority, especially
    if it be foreign, now stood her in good stead?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about,&rdquo; she said with
    an arrogant toss of the head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Zat is a lie, is it not?&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly calmly, as she
    drew from her reticule the typewritten letter which Jane Turner had sent
    to the Countess of Hohengebirg. &ldquo;Zis you wrote to my daughter-in-law;
    ze letter reached me instead of her. It interests me much. I vill give you
    two tousend pounds for ze photograph of her and Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Rumboldt.
    You vill sell it to me for zat, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The production of the letter had somewhat cowed Jane&rsquo;s bold spirit.
    But she was still defiant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the photograph here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, no! but you vill get it&mdash;yes?&rdquo; said my lady, quietly
    replacing the letter in her reticule. &ldquo;In ze letter you offer to get
    it for tousend pound. I vill give you two tousend. To-day is a holiday for
    you. You vill get ze photograph from ze gentleman&mdash;not? And I vill vait
    here till you come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon she rearranged her skirts round her and folded her hands placidly,
    like one prepared to wait.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the photograph,&rdquo; said Jane Turner, doggedly, &ldquo;and
    I can&rsquo;t get it to-day. The&mdash;the person who has it doesn&rsquo;t
    live in Bristol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No? Ah! but quite close, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; rejoined my lady,
    placidly. &ldquo;I can vait all ze day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted Jane Turner, whose voice now
    shook with obvious rage or fear&mdash;I knew not which. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    get the photograph to-day&mdash;so there! And I won&rsquo;t sell it to you&mdash;I
    won&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want your two thousand pounds. How do I know you
    are not an imposter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From zis, my good girl,&rdquo; said Lady Molly, quietly; &ldquo;that
    if I leave zis room wizout ze photograph, I go straight to ze police with
    zis letter, and you shall be prosecuted by ze Grand Duke, my son, for blackmailing
    his wife. You see, I am not like my daughter-in-law; I am not afraid of a
    scandal. So you vill fetch ze photograph&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it? I and ze Princess
    Amalie vill vait for it here. Zat is your bedroom&mdash;not?&rdquo; she added,
    pointing to a door which obviously gave on an inner room.  &ldquo;Vill you
    put on your hat and go at once, please? Two tousend pound or two years in
    prison&mdash;you have ze choice&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jane Turner tried to keep up her air of defiance, looking Lady Molly full
    in the face; but I who watched her could see the boldness in her eyes gradually
    giving place to fear, and then to terror and even despair; the girl&rsquo;s
    face seemed literally to grow old as I looked at it&mdash;pale, haggard,
    and drawn&mdash;whilst Lady Molly kept her stern, luminous eyes fixed steadily
    upon her.</p>
  <p>Then, with a curious, wild gesture, which somehow filled me with a nameless
    fear, Jane Turner turned on her heel and ran into the inner room.</p>
  <p>There followed a moment of silence. To me it was tense and agonising. I
    was straining my ears to hear what was going on in that inner room. That
    my dear lady was not as callous as she wished to appear was shown by the
    strange look of expectancy in her beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p>The minutes sped on&mdash;how many I could not afterwards have said. I was
    conscious of a clock ticking monotonously over the shabby mantelpiece, of
    an errand boy outside shouting at the top of his voice, of the measured step
    of the cab horse which had brought us hither being walked up and down the
    street.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly there was a violent crash, as of heavy furniture being thrown
    down. I could not suppress a scream, for my nerves by now were terribly on
    the jar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Mary&mdash;the inner room!&rdquo; said Lady Molly. &ldquo;I
    thought the girl might do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dared not pause in order to ask what &ldquo;that&rdquo; meant, but flew
    to the door.</p>
  <p>It was locked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Downstairs&mdash;quick!&rdquo; commanded my lady. &ldquo;I ordered
    Danvers to be on the watch outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You may imagine how I flew, and how I blessed my dear lady&rsquo;s forethought
    in the midst of her daring plan, when, having literally torn open the front
    door, I saw Inspector Danvers in plain clothes, calmly patrolling the street.
    I beckoned to him&mdash;he was keeping a sharp look-out&mdash;and together
    we ran back into the house.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, the landlady and the servant were busy in the basement, and
    had neither heard the crash nor seen me run in search of Danvers. My dear
    lady was still alone in the dingy parlour, stooping against the door of the
    inner room, her ear glued to the keyhole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not too late, I think,&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;Break
    it open, Danvers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page136.jpg" width="533" height="750"></p>
  <p>Danvers, who is a great, strong man, soon put his shoulder to the rickety
    door, which yielded to the first blow.</p>
  <p>The sight which greeted us filled me with horror, for I had never seen such
    a tragedy before. The wretched girl, Jane Turner, had tied a rope to a ring
    in the ceiling, which I suppose at one time held a hanging lamp; the other
    end of that rope she had formed into a slip-noose, and passed round her neck.</p>
  <p>She had apparently climbed on to a table, and then used her best efforts
    to end her life by kicking the table away from under her. This was the crash
    which we had heard, and which had caused us to come to her rescue. Fortunately,
    her feet had caught in the back of a chair close by; the slip-noose was strangling
    her, and her face was awful to behold, but she was not dead.</p>
  <p>Danvers soon got her down. He is a first-aid man, and has done these terrible
    jobs before. As soon as the girl had partially recovered, Lady Molly sent
    him and me out of the room. In the dark and dusty parlour, where but a few
    moments ago I had played my small part in a grim comedy, I now waited to
    hear what the sequel to it would be.</p>
  <p>Danvers had been gone some time, and the shades of evening were drawing
    in; outside, the mean-looking street looked particularly dreary. It was close
    on six o&rsquo;clock when at last I heard the welcome rustle of silks, the
    opening of a door, and at last my dear lady&mdash;looking grave but serene&mdash;came
    out of the inner room, and, beckoning to me, without a word led the way out
    of the house and into the fly, which was still waiting at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send a doctor to her,&rdquo; were her first words as
    soon as we were clear of Bread Street. &ldquo;But she is quite all right
    now, save that she wants a sleeping draught. Well, she has been punished
    enough, I think. She won&rsquo;t try her hand at blackmailing again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the photograph never existed?&rdquo; I asked amazed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the plate was a failure, but Jane Turner would not thus readily
    give up the idea of getting money out of the poor, pusillanimous Countess.
    We know how she succeeded in terrorizing that silly little woman. It is wonderful
    how cleverly a girl like that worked out such a complicated scheme, all alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; there was no one else. She was the elderly woman who used to
    meet the Countess, and who rang at the front door of the Weston apartment-house.
    She arranged the whole of the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the assault
    on herself, all alone, and took everybody in with it&mdash;it was so perfectly
    done. She planned and executed it because she was afraid that the little
    Countess would be goaded into confessing her folly to her husband, or to
    her own parents, when a prosecution for blackmail would inevitably follow.
    So she risked everything on a big <i>coup</i>, and almost succeeded in getting
    a thousand pounds from Her Serene Highness, meaning to reassure her, as soon
    as she had the money, by the statement that the negative and prints had been
    destroyed. But the appearance of the Grand Duchess of Starkburg-Nauheim this
    afternoon frightened her into an act of despair. Confronted with the prosecution
    she dreaded and with the prison she dared not face, she, in a mad moment,
    attempted to take her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose now the whole matter will be hushed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lady Molly with a wistful sigh. &ldquo;The public
    will never know who assaulted Jane Turner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was naturally a little regretful at that. But it was a joy to see her
    the day when she was able to assure Her Serene Highness the Countess of Hohengebirg
    that she need never again fear the consequences of that fatal day&rsquo;s
    folly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACastleInBrittany"></a>A Castle In Brittany</b></h2>
  <p>YES! we are just back from our holiday, my dear lady and I&mdash;a well-earned
    holiday, I can tell you that.</p>
  <p>We went to Porho&euml;t, you know&mdash;a dear little village in the hinterland
    of Brittany, not very far from the coast; an enchanting spot, hidden away
    in a valley, bordered by a mountain stream, wild, romantic, picturesque&mdash;Brittany,
    in fact.</p>
  <p>We had discovered the little place quite accidentally last year, in the
    course of our wanderings, and stayed there then about three weeks, laying
    the foundations of that strange adventure which reached its culminating point
    just a month ago.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know if the story will interest you, for Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    share in the adventure was purely a private one and had nothing whatever
    to do with her professional work. At the same time it illustrates in a very
    marked manner that extraordinary faculty which she possesses of divining
    her fellow-creatures&rsquo; motives and intentions.</p>
  <p>We had rooms and <i>pension</i> in the dear little convent on the outskirts
    of the village, close to the quaint church and the picturesque presbytery,
    and soon we made the acquaintance of the Cur&eacute;, a simple-minded, kindly
    old man, whose sorrow at the thought that two such charming English ladies
    as Lady Molly and myself should be heretics was more than counter-balanced
    by his delight in having someone of the  &ldquo;great outside world&rdquo;&mdash;as
    he called it&mdash;to talk to, whilst he told us quite ingenuously something
    of his own simple life, of this village which he loved, and also of his parishioners.</p>
  <p>One personality among the latter occupied his thoughts and conversation
    a great deal, and I must say interested us keenly. It was that of Miss Angela
    de Genneville, who owned the magnificent ch&acirc;teau of Porho&euml;t, one
    of the seven wonders of architectural France. She was an Englishwoman by
    birth&mdash;being of a Jersey family&mdash;and was immensely wealthy, her
    uncle, who was also her godfather, having bequeathed to her the largest cigar
    factory in St. Heliers, besides three-quarters of a million sterling.</p>
  <p>To say that Miss de Genneville was eccentric was but to put it mildly; in
    the village she was generally thought to be quite mad. The Cur&eacute; vaguely
    hinted that a tragic love story was at the bottom of all her eccentricities.
    Certain it is that, for no apparent reason, and when she was still a youngish
    woman, she had sold the Jersey business and realised the whole of her fortune.
    After two years of continuous travelling, she came to Brittany on a visit
    to her sister&mdash;the widowed Marquise de Terhoven, who owned a small property
    close to Porho&euml;t, and lived there in retirement and poverty with her
    only son, Am&eacute;d&eacute;.</p>
  <p>Miss Angela de Genneville was agreeably taken with the beauty and quietude
    of this remote little village. The beautiful ch&acirc;teau of Porho&euml;t
    being for sale at the time, she bought it, took out letters of naturalization,
    became a French subject, and from that moment never went outside the precincts
    of her newly acquired domain.</p>
  <p>She never returned to England, and, with the exception of the Cur&eacute;  and
    her own sister and nephew, saw no one beyond her small retinue of servants.</p>
  <p>But the dear old Cur&eacute; thought all the world of her, for she was supremely
    charitable to him and to the poor, and scarcely a day passed but he told
    us something either of her kindness or of her eccentric ways. One day he
    arrived at the convent at an unaccustomed hour; we had just finished our
    simple <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> of steaming coffee and rolls when we saw him
    coming towards us across the garden.</p>
  <p>That he was excited and perturbed was at once apparent by his hurried gait
    and by the flush on his kindly face. He bade us a very hasty &ldquo;Good
    morning, my daughters!&rdquo; and plunged abruptly into his subject. He explained
    with great volubility, which was intended to mask his agitation, that he
    was the bearer of an invitation to the charming English lady&mdash;a curious
    invitation, ah, yes! perhaps!&mdash;Mademoiselle de Genneville&mdash;very
    eccentric&mdash;but she is in great trouble&mdash;in very serious trouble&mdash;and
    very ill too, now&mdash;poor lady&mdash;half paralysed and feeble&mdash;yes,
    feeble in the brain&mdash;and then her nephew, the Marquis Am&eacute;d&eacute; de
    Terhoven&mdash;such a misguided young man&mdash;has got into bad company
    in that den of wickedness called Paris&mdash;since then it has been debts&mdash;always
    debts&mdash;his mother is so indulgent!&mdash;too indulgent! but an only
    son!&mdash;the charming English ladies would understand. It was very sad&mdash;very,
    very sad&mdash;and no wonder Mademoiselle de Genneville was very angry. She
    had paid Monsieur le Marquis&rsquo; debts once, twice, three times&mdash;but
    now she will not pay any more&mdash;but she is in great trouble and wants
    a friend&mdash;a female friend, one of her own country, she declares&mdash;for
    he himself, alas! was only a poor <i>cur&eacute; de village</i>, and did
    not understand great ladies and their curious ways. It would be true Christian
    charity if the charming English lady would come and see Mademoiselle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But her own sister, the Marquise?&rdquo; suggested Lady Molly, breaking
    in on the old man&rsquo;s volubility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! her sister, of course,&rdquo; he replied with a sigh. &ldquo;Madame
    la Marquise&mdash;but then she is Monsieur le Marquis&rsquo; mother, and
    the charming English lady would understand&mdash;a mother&rsquo;s heart,
    of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am a complete stranger to Miss de Genneville,&rdquo; protested
    Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, but Mademoiselle has always remained an Englishwoman at heart,&rdquo;  replied
    the Cur&eacute;. &ldquo;She said to me to-day: &lsquo;I seem to long for
    an Englishwoman&rsquo;s handshake, a sober-minded, sensible Englishwoman,
    to help me in this difficulty. Bring your English friend to me, Monsieur
    le Cur&eacute;, if she will come to the assistance of an old woman who has
    no one to turn to in her distress.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Of course, after that I knew that my dear lady would yield. Moreover, she
    was keenly interested in Miss de Genneville, and without further discussion
    she told Monsieur le Cur&eacute; that she was quite ready to accompany him
    to the ch&acirc;teau of Porho&euml;t.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Of course, I was not present at the interview, but Lady Molly has so often
    told me all that happened and how it happened, and with such a wealth of
    picturesque and minute detail, that sometimes I find it difficult to realise
    that I myself was not there in person.</p>
  <p>It seems that Monsier le Cur&eacute; himself ushered my lady into the presence
    of Miss Angela de Genneville. The old lady was not alone when they entered;
    Madame la Marquise de Terhoven, an elderly, somewhat florid woman, whose
    features, though distinctly coarse, recalled those of her sister, sat on
    a high-backed chair close to a table, on which her fingers were nervously
    drumming a tattoo, whilst in the window embrasure stood a young man whose
    resemblance to both the ladies at once proclaimed him to Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    quick perception as the son of the one and nephew of the other&mdash;the
    Marquis de Terhoven, in fact.</p>
  <p>Miss de Genneville sat erect in a huge armchair; her face was the hue of
    yellow wax, the flesh literally shrivelled on the bones, the eyes of a curious,
    unnatural brilliance; one hand clutched feverishly the arm of her chair,
    the other, totally paralysed, lay limp and inert on her lap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! the Englishwoman at last, thank God!&rdquo; she said in a high-pitched,
    strident voice as soon as Lady Molly entered the room. &ldquo;Come here,
    my dear, for I have wanted one of your kind badly. A true-hearted Englishwoman
    is the finest product of God&rsquo;s earth, after all&rsquo;s said and done. <i>Pardieu!</i> but
    I breathe again,&rdquo; she added, as my dear lady advanced somewhat diffidently
    to greet her, and took the trembling hand which Miss Angela extended to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down close to me,&rdquo; commanded the eccentric old lady, whilst
    Lady Molly, confused, and not a little angered at finding herself in the
    very midst of what was obviously a family conclave, was vaguely wondering
    how soon she could slip away again. But the trembling hand of the paralytic
    clutched her own slender wrist so tightly, forcing her to sink into a low
    chair close by, and holding her there as with a grip of steel, that it would
    have been useless and perhaps cruel to resist.</p>
  <p>Satisfied now that her newly found friend, as well as Monsieur le Cur&eacute;,
    were prepared to remain by her and to listen to what she had to say, the
    sick woman turned with a look of violent wrath towards the window embrasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just telling that fine nephew of mine that he is counting his
    chickens before they are hatched. I am not yet dead, as Monsieur my nephew
    can see; and I have made a will&mdash;aye, and placed it where his thievish
    fingers can never reach it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man, who up to now had been gazing stolidly out of the window,
    now suddenly turned on his heel, confronting the old woman, with a look of
    hate gleaming in his eyes.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page144.jpg" width="557" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can fight the will,&rdquo; here interposed Madame la Marquise,
    icily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo; queried the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you were paralysed and imbecile when you made it,&rdquo; replied
    the Marquise, dryly.</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Cur&eacute;, who up to now had been fidgeting nervously with
    his hat, now raised his hands and eyes up to the ceiling to emphasise the
    horror which he felt at this callous suggestion. Lady Molly no longer desired
    to go; the half-paralysed grip on her wrist had relaxed, but she sat there
    quietly, interested with every fibre of her quick intelligence in the moving
    drama which was being unfolded before her.</p>
  <p>There was a pause now, a silence broken only by the monotonous ticking of
    a monumental, curious-looking clock which stood in an angle of the room.
    Miss de Genneville had made no reply to her sister&rsquo;s cruel taunt, but
    a look, furtive, maniacal, almost dangerous, now crept into her eyes.</p>
  <p>Then she addressed the Cur&eacute;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you pen, ink and paper&mdash;here, on this table,&rdquo; she
    requested. Then as he complied with alacrity, she once more turned to her
    nephew, and pointing to the writing materials:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down and write, Am&eacute;d&eacute;,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Write what?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A confession, my nephew,&rdquo; said the old woman, with a shrill
    laugh.  &ldquo;A confession of those little pecaddilloes of yours, which,
    unless I come to your rescue now, will land you for seven years in a penal
    settlement, if I mistake not. Eh, my fine nephew?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A confession?&rdquo; retorted Am&eacute;d&eacute; de Terhoven savagely. &ldquo;Do
    you take me for a fool?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my nephew, I take you for a wise man&mdash;who understands that
    his dear aunt will not buy those interesting forgeries, perpetrated by Monsieur
    le Marquis Am&eacute;d&eacute; de Terhoven, and offered to her by Rubinstein
    the money-lender, unless that confession is written and signed by you. Write
    Am&eacute;d&eacute;, write that confession, my dear nephew, if you do not
    wish to see yourself in the dock on a charge of forging your aunt&rsquo;s
    name to a bill for one hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Am&eacute;d&eacute; muttered a curse between his teeth. Obviously the old
    woman&rsquo;s shaft had struck home. He knew himself to be in a hopeless
    plight. It appears that a money-lender had threatened to send the forged
    bills to Monsieur le Procureur de la R&eacute;publique unless they were paid
    within twenty-four hours, and no one could pay them but Miss de Genneville,
    who had refused to do it except at the price of this humiliating confession.</p>
  <p>A look of intelligence passed between mother and son. Intercepted by Lady
    Molly and interpreted by her, it seemed to suggest the idea of humouring
    the old aunt, for the moment, until the forgeries were safely out of the
    money-lender&rsquo;s hands, then of mollifying her later on, when perhaps
    she would have forgotten, or sunk deeper into helplessness and imbecility.</p>
  <p>As if in answer to his mother&rsquo;s look the young man now said curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must know what use you mean to make of the confession if I do write
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will depend on yourself,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle, dryly. &ldquo;You
    may be sure that I will not willingly send my own nephew to penal servitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For another moment the young man hesitated, then he sat down, sullen and
    wrathful, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write&mdash;you may dictate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman laughed a short, dry, sarcastic laugh. Then, at her dictation,
    Am&eacute;d&eacute; wrote:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I, Am&eacute;d&eacute;, Marquis de Terhoven, hereby make confession
    to having forged Mademoiselle Angela de Genneville&rsquo;s name to the annexed
    bills, thereby obtaining the sum of one hundred thousand francs from Abraham
    Rubinstein, of Brest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Monsieur le Cur&eacute;, will you kindly witness le Marquis&rsquo; signature?&rdquo;  said
    the irascible old lady when Am&eacute;d&eacute; had finished writing; &ldquo;and
    you, too, my dear?&rdquo;  she added, turning to Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>My dear lady hesitated for a moment. Naturally she did not desire to be
    thus mixed up in this family feud, but a strange impulse had drawn her sympathy
    to this eccentric old lady, who, in the midst of her semi-regal splendour
    seemed so forlorn, between her nephew, who was a criminal and a blackguard,
    and her sister, who was but little less contemptible.</p>
  <p>Obeying this impulse, and also a look of entreaty from the Cur&eacute;,
    she affixed her own signature as witness to the document, and this despite
    the fact that both the Marquise and her son threw her a look of hate which
    might have made a weaker spirit tremble with foreboding.</p>
  <p>Not so Lady Molly. Those very same threatening looks served but to decide
    her. Then, at Mademoiselle&rsquo;s command, she folded up the document, slipped
    it into an envelope, sealed it, and finally addressed it to M. le Procureur
    de la R&eacute;publique, resident at Caen.</p>
  <p>Am&eacute;d&eacute; watched all these proceedings with eyes that were burning
    with impotent wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This letter,&rdquo; now resumed the old lady, more calmly. &ldquo;will
    be sent under cover to my lawyer Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me, of Paris, who
    drew up my will, with orders only to post it in case of certain eventualities,
    which I will explain later on. In the meanwhile, my dear nephew, you may
    apprise your friend, Abraham Rubinstein, that I will buy back those interesting
    forgeries of yours on the day on which I hear from Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me
    that he has safely received my letter with this enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is infamous&mdash;&rdquo; here broke in the Marquise, rising
    in full wrath, unable to control herself any longer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
    you put under restraint as a dangerous lunatic. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, of course, I could not buy back the bills from Rubinstein,&rdquo;  rejoined
    Mademoiselle, calmly.</p>
  <p>Then, as the Marquise subsided&mdash;cowed, terrified, realising the hopelessness
    of her son&rsquo;s position&mdash;the old lady turned placidly to my dear
    lady, whilst her trembling fingers once more clutched the slender hand of
    her newly found English friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have asked you, my dear, and Monsieur le Cur&eacute;, to come to
    me to-day,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;because I wish you both to be of assistance
    to me in the carrying out of my dying wishes. You must promise me most solemnly,
    both of you, that when I am dead you will carry out these wishes to the letter.
    Promise!&rdquo; she added with passionate earnestness.</p>
  <p>The promise was duly given by Lady Molly and the old Cur&eacute;, then Mademoiselle
    resumed more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now I want you to look at that clock,&rdquo; she said abruptly,
    with seeming irrelevance. &ldquo;It is an old heirloom which belonged to
    the former owners of Porho&euml;t, and which I bought along with the house.
    You will notice that it is one of the most remarkable pieces of mechanism
    which brain of man has ever devised, for it has this great peculiarity, that
    it goes for three hundred and sixty-six days consecutively, keeping most
    perfect time. When the works have all but run down, the weights&mdash;which
    are enormous&mdash;release a certain spring, and the great doors of the case
    open of themselves, thus allowing the clock to be wound up. After that is
    done, and the doors pushed to again, no one can open them until another three
    hundred and sixty-six days have gone by&mdash;that is to say, not without
    breaking the case to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly examined the curious old clock with great attention. Vaguely
    she guessed already what the drift of the old lady&rsquo;s curious explanations
    would be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two days ago,&rdquo; continued Mademoiselle, &ldquo;the clock was
    open, and Monsieur le Cur&eacute; wound it up, but before I pushed the doors
    to again I slipped certain papers into the case&mdash;you remember, Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle, I remember,&rdquo; responded the old man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those papers were my last will and testament, bequeathing all I possess
    to the parish of Porho&euml;t,&rdquo; said Miss de Genneville, dryly, &ldquo;and
    now the doors of the massive case are closed. No one can get at my will for
    another three hundred and sixty-four days&mdash;no one,&rdquo; she added
    with a shrill laugh, &ldquo;not even my nephew, Am&eacute;d&eacute; de Terhoven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A silence ensued, only broken by the rustle of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s
    silk dress as she shrugged her shoulders and gave a short, sarcastic chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; resumed Mademoiselle, looking straight into Lady
    Molly&rsquo;s eager, glowing face, &ldquo;you must promise me that, three
    hundred and sixty-four days hence, that is to say on the 20th September next
    year, you and Monsieur le Cur&eacute;&mdash;or one of you if the other be
    incapacitated&mdash;will be present in this room at this hour when the door
    of the clock will open. You will then wind up the family heirloom, take out
    the papers which you will find buried beneath the weights, and hand them
    over to Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me for probate at the earliest opportunity.
    Monseigneur the Bishop of Caen, the Mayor of this Commune, and the Souspr&eacute;fet
    of this Department have all been informed of the contents of my will, and
    also that it is practically in the keeping of le Cur&eacute; de Porho&euml;t,
    who, no doubt, realises what the serious consequences to himself would be
    if he failed to produce the will at the necessary time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The poor Cur&eacute; gasped with terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered meekly, &ldquo;I
    may be forcibly prevented from entering the house&mdash;I might be ill or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shuddered with an unavowable fear, then added more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might be unjustly accused then of stealing the will&mdash;of defrauding
    the poor of Porho&euml;t in favour of&mdash;Mademoiselle&rsquo;s direct heirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear, my good friend,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle, dryly; &ldquo;though
    I have one foot in the grave I am not quite so imbecile as my dear sister
    and nephew here would suggest, and I have provided for every eventuality.
    If you are ill or otherwise prevented by outside causes from being present
    here on the day and hour named, this charming English lady will be able to
    replace you. But if either of you is forcibly prevented from entering this
    house, or if, having entered this room, the slightest violence or even pressure
    is put upon you, or if you should find the clock broken, damaged and&mdash;stripped
    of its contents, all you need do is to apprise Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me
    of the fact. He will know how to act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would he do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send a certain confession we all know of to Monsieur le Procureur
    de la R&eacute;publique,&rdquo; replied the old lady, fixing the young Marquis
    Am&eacute;d&eacute; with her irascible eye. &ldquo;That same confession,&rdquo; she
    continued lightly, &ldquo;Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me is instructed to destroy
    if you, Monsieur, and my English friend here, and the clock, are all undamaged
    on the eventful day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the great, dark room for awhile, broken only by the
    sarcastic chuckle of the enfeebled invalid, tired out after this harrowing
    scene, wherein she had pitted her half-maniacal ingenuity against the greed
    and rapacity of a conscienceless rou&eacute;.</p>
  <p>That she had hemmed her nephew and sister in on every side could not be
    denied. Lady Molly herself felt somewhat awed at this weird revenge conceived
    by the outraged old lady against her grasping relatives.</p>
  <p>She was far too interested in the whole drama to give up her own part in
    it, and, as she subsequently explained to me, she felt it her duty to remain
    the partner and co-worker of the poor Cur&eacute; in this dangerous task
    of securing to the poor of Porho&euml;t the fortune which otherwise would
    be squandered away on gaming tables and race-courses.</p>
  <p>For this, and many reasons too complicated to analyse, she decided to accept
    her share in the trust imposed upon her by her newly-found friend.</p>
  <p>Neither the Marquise nor her son took any notice of Lady Molly as she presently
    took leave of Mademoiselle de Genneville, who, at the last, made her take
    a solemn oath that she would stand by the Cur&eacute; and fulfil the wishes
    of a dying and much-wronged woman.</p>
  <p>Much perturbed, monsieur le Cur&eacute; went away. Lady Molly went several
    times after that to the ch&acirc;teau of Porho&euml;t to see the invalid,
    who had taken a violent fancy to her. In October we had, perforce, to return
    to England and to work, and the following spring we had news from the Cur&eacute; that
    Mademoiselle de Genneville was dead.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Lady Molly had certainly been working too hard, and was in a feeble state
    of health when we reached Porho&euml;t the following 19th of September, less
    than twenty-four hours before the eventful moment when the old clock would
    reveal the will and testament of Mademoiselle de Genneville.</p>
  <p>We walked straight from the station to the presbytery, anxious to see the
    Cur&eacute; and to make all arrangements for to-morrow&rsquo;s business.
    To our terrible sorrow and distress, we were informed by the housekeeper
    that the Cur&eacute; was very seriously ill at the hospital at Brest, whither
    he had been removed by the doctor&rsquo;s orders.</p>
  <p>This was the first inkling I had that things would not go as smoothly as
    I had anticipated. Miss de Genneville&rsquo;s dispositions with regard to
    the sensational disclosure of her will had, to my mind, been so ably taken
    that it had never struck me until now that the Marquise de Terhoven and her
    precious son would make a desperate fight before they gave up all thoughts
    of the coveted fortune.</p>
  <p>I imagined the Marquis hemmed in on every side; any violence offered against
    the Cur&eacute; or Lady Molly when they entered the ch&acirc;teau in order
    to accomplish the task allotted to them being visited by the sending of the
    confession to Monsieur le Procureur de la R&eacute;publique, when prosecution
    for forgery would immediately follow. Damage to the clock itself would be
    punished in the same way.</p>
  <p>But I had never thought of sudden illnesses, of&mdash;heaven help us!&mdash;poison
    or unaccountable accidents to either the Cur&eacute; or to the woman I loved
    best in all the world.</p>
  <p>No wonder Lady Molly looked pale and fragile as, having thanked the housekeeper,
    we found our way in silence to the convent where we had once again engaged
    rooms.</p>
  <p>Somehow the hospitality shown us last year had lost something of its cordiality.
    Moreover, our bedrooms this time did not communicate with one another, but
    opened out independently on to a stone passage.</p>
  <p>The sister who showed us upstairs explained, somewhat shamefacedly, that
    as the Mother Superior had not expected us, she had let the room which was
    between our two bedrooms to a lady visitor, who, however, was ill in bed
    at the present moment.</p>
  <p>That sixth sense, of which so much has been said and written, but which
    I will not attempt to explain, told me plainly enough that we were no longer
    amidst friends in the convent.</p>
  <p>Had bribery been at work? Was the lady visitor a spy set upon our movements
    by the Terhovens? It was impossible to say. I could no longer chase away
    the many gloomy forebodings which assailed me the rest of that day and drove
    away sleep during the night. I can assure you that in my heart I wished all
    eccentric old ladies and their hidden wills at the bottom of the sea.</p>
  <p>My dear lady was apparently also very deeply perturbed; any attempt on my
    part to broach the subject of Miss de Genneville&rsquo;s will was promptly
    and authoritatively checked by her. At the same time I knew her well enough
    to guess that all these nameless dangers which seemed to have crept up round
    her only served to enhance her determination to carry out her old friend&rsquo;s
    dying wishes to the letter.</p>
  <p>We went to bed quite early; for the first time without that delightful final
    gossip, when events, plans, surmises and work were freely discussed between
    us. The unseen lady visitor in the room which separated us acted as a wet
    blanket on our intimacy.</p>
  <p>I stayed with Lady Molly until she was in bed. She hardly talked to me whilst
    she undressed, but when I kissed her &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; she whispered
    almost inaudibly right into my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Terhoven faction are at work. They may waylay you and offer you
    a bribe to keep me out of the ch&acirc;teau to-morrow. Pretend to fall in
    with their views. Accept all bribes and place yourself at their disposal.
    I must not say more now. We are being spied upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That my lady was, as usual, right in her surmises was proved within the
    next five minutes. I had slipped out of her room, and was just going into
    mine, when I heard my name spoken hardly above a whisper, whilst I felt my
    arm gently seized from behind.</p>
  <p>An elderly, somewhat florid, woman stood before me attired in a dingy-coloured
    dressing-gown. She was pointing towards my own bedroom door, implying her
    desire to accompany me to my room. Remembering my dear lady&rsquo;s parting
    injunctions, I nodded in acquiescence. She followed me, after having peered
    cautiously up and down the passage.</p>
  <p>Then, when the door was duly closed, and she was satisfied that we were
    alone, she said very abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Granard, tell me! you are poor, eh?&mdash;a paid companion to
    your rich friend, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still thinking of Lady Molly&rsquo;s commands, I replied with a pathetic
    sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the old lady, eagerly, &ldquo;would you like to
    earn fifty thousand francs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The eagerness with which I responded &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; apparently pleased
    her, for she gave a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know the story of my sister&rsquo;s will&mdash;of the clock?&rdquo; she
    asked eagerly:  &ldquo;of your friend&rsquo;s role in this shameless business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more I nodded. I knew that my lady had guessed rightly. This was the
    Marquise de Terhoven, planted here in the convent to gain my confidence,
    to spy on Lady Molly, and to offer me a bribe.</p>
  <p>Now for some clever tactics on my part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you prevent your friend from being at the ch&acirc;teau to-morrow
    before one o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; asked the Marquise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; I replied calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is ill, as you know. The doctor has ordered her a sleeping draught.
    I administer it. I can arrange that she has a strong dose in the morning
    instead of her other medicine. She will sleep till the late afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I rattled this off glibly in my best French. Madame la Marquise heaved a
    deep sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that is good!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then listen to me. Do as
    I tell you, and to-morrow you will be richer by fifty thousand francs. Come
    to the ch&acirc;teau in the morning, dressed in your friend&rsquo;s clothes.
    My son will be there; together you will assist at the opening of the secret
    doors, and when my son has wound up the old clock himself, he will place
    fifty thousand francs in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Monsieur le Cur&eacute;?&rdquo; I suggested tentatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is ill,&rdquo; she replied curtly.</p>
  <p>But as she spoke these three words there was such an evil sneer in her face,
    such a look of cruel triumph in her eyes, that all my worst suspicions were
    at once confirmed.</p>
  <p>Had these people&rsquo;s unscrupulous rapacity indeed bribed some needy
    country practitioner to put the Cur&eacute; temporarily out of the way? It
    was too awful to think of, and I can tell you that I needed all my presence
    of mind, all my desire to act my part bravely and intelligently to the end,
    not to fly from this woman in horror.</p>
  <p>She gave me a few more instructions with regard to the services which she
    and her precious son would expect of me on the morrow. It seems that, some
    time before her death, Miss de Genneville had laid strict injunctions on
    two of her most trusted men-servants to remain in the ch&acirc;teau, and
    to be on the watch on the eventful 20th day of September of this year, lest
    any serious violence be done to the English lady or to the Cur&eacute;. It
    was with a view to allay any suspicion which might arise in the minds of
    these two men that the Marquis desired me to impersonate Lady Molly to-morrow,
    and to enter with him&mdash;on seemingly friendly terms&mdash;the room where
    stood the monumental clock.</p>
  <p>For these services, together with those whereby Lady Molly was to be sent
    into a drugged sleep whilst the theft of the will was being carried through,
    I&mdash;Mary Granard&mdash;was to receive from Monsieur le Marquis de Terhoven
    the sum of fifty thousand francs.</p>
  <p>All these matters being settled to this wicked woman&rsquo;s apparent satisfaction,
    she presently took hold of both my hands, shook them warmly, and called me
    her dearest friend; assured me of everlasting gratitude, and finally, to
    my intense relief, slipped noiselessly out of my room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>I surmised&mdash;I think correctly&mdash;that Madame la Marquise would spend
    most of the night with her ear glued to the thin partition which separated
    her room from that of Lady Molly; so I did not dare to go and report myself
    and the momentous conversation which I had just had, and vaguely wondered
    when I should have an opportunity of talking matters over with my dear lady
    without feeling that a spy was at my heels.</p>
  <p>The next morning when I went into her room, to my boundless amazement&mdash;and
    before I had time to utter a word&mdash;she moaned audibly, as if in great
    pain, and said feebly, but very distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary! I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. I feel terribly ill.
    I haven&rsquo;t had a wink of sleep all night, and I am too weak to attempt
    to get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fortunately my perceptions had not been dulled by the excitement of the
    past few hours, and I could see that she was not so ill as she made out.
    Her eyes sought mine as I approached her bed, and her lips alone framed the
    words which I believed I interpreted correctly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do as they want. I stay in bed. Will explain later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently she had reason to think that we were being closely watched; but
    what I could not understand was, what did she expect would happen if she
    herself were not present when the opening of the clock door would disclose
    the will? Did she want me to snatch the document: to bear the brunt of the
    Terhovens&rsquo; wrath and disappointment? It was not like her to be afraid
    of fulfilling a duty, however dangerous that fulfilment might prove; and
    it certainly was not like her to break a promise given to a dying person.</p>
  <p>But, of course, my business was to obey. Assuming that our movements were
    being watched, I poured out a dose of medicine for my dear lady, which she
    took and then fell back on her pillows as if exhausted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I could sleep now, Mary,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but wake
    me later on; I must be at the ch&acirc;teau by twelve o&rsquo;clock, you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As one of Lady Molly&rsquo;s boxes was in my room, I had no difficulty in
    arraying myself in some of her clothes. Thus equipped and closely veiled,
    still ignorant of my lady&rsquo;s plans, anxious, but determined to obey
    like a soldier, blindly and unquestioningly, I made my way to the ch&acirc;teau
    a little before noon.</p>
  <p>An old butler opened the door in answer to my ring, and in the inner hall
    sat the Marquise de Terhoven, whilst her son was walking agitatedly up and
    down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! here comes my lady,&rdquo; said the Marquise, with easy unconcern.  &ldquo;You
    have come, my lady,&rdquo; she added, rising and taking my hand, &ldquo;to
    perform a duty which will rob my son of a fortune which by right should have
    been his. We can put no hindrance in your way, under penalty of an appalling
    disgrace which would then fall on my son; moreover, my late sister has filled
    this house with guards and spies. So, believe me, you need have no fear.
    You can perform your duty undisturbed. Perhaps you will not object to my
    son keeping you company. My precious sister had the door of her room removed
    before her death and a curtain put in its stead,&rdquo; she concluded with
    what was intended to be the sneer of a disappointed fortune-hunter, &ldquo;so
    the least call from you will bring her spies to your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without a word the Marquis and I bowed to one another, then, preceded by
    the old family butler, we went up the monumental staircase to what I suppose
    had been the eccentric old lady&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>The butler drew the <i>porti&egrave;re</i> curtain aside and he remained
    in the corridor whilst we went within. There stood the massive clock exactly
    as my lady had often described it to me. It was ticking with slow and deep-toned
    majesty.</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Marquis pointed to an armchair for me. He was obviously in a
    state of terrible nerve-tension. He could not sit still, and his fingers
    were incessantly clasped and unclasped with a curious, febrile movement,
    which betrayed his intense agitation.</p>
  <p>I was about to make a remark when he abruptly seized my wrist, placed one
    finger to his lips, and pointed in the direction of the <i>porti&egrave;re.</i> Apparently
    he thought that someone was on the watch outside, but the clock itself was
    so placed that it could not be seen by anyone who was not actually in the
    room.</p>
  <p>After that we were both silent, whilst that old piece of mechanism ticked
    on relentlessly, still hiding the secret which it contained.</p>
  <p>I would have given two years&rsquo; salary to know what Lady Molly would
    have wished me to do. Frankly, I fully expected to see her walk in at any
    moment. I could not bring myself to believe that she meant to shirk her duty.</p>
  <p>But she had said to me, &ldquo;Fall in with their views,&rdquo; So that
    when, presently, the Marquis beckoned to me across the room to come and examine
    the clock, I obeyed readily enough. I felt, by that time, as if my entire
    body was stuffed with needles and pins, which were pricking my nerves and
    skin until I could have yelled with the agony of the sensation.</p>
  <p>I walked across the room as if in a dream, and looked at the curious clock
    which, in less than fifteen minutes, would reveal its hidden secret. I suppose
    cleverer people than poor Mary Granard could enter into long philosophical
    disquisitions as to this dumb piece of mechanism which held the fate of this
    ruined, unscrupulous gambler safely within its doors; but I was only conscious
    of that incessant tick, tick, tick, whilst my eyes literally ached with staring
    at the door.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know now how it all happened, for, of course, I was taken
    unawares; but the next moment I found myself quite helpless, hardly able
    to breathe, for a woolen scarf was being wound round my mouth, whilst two
    strong arms encircled my body so that I could not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is only a protection for myself, my dear Miss Granard,&rdquo; a
    trembling voice whispered in my ear; &ldquo;keep quite still; no harm will
    come to you. In ten minutes you shall have your fifty thousand francs in
    your pocket, and can walk unconcernedly out of the ch&acirc;teau. Neither
    your English lady nor Monsieur le Cur&eacute; can say that they suffered
    any violence, nor will the clock be damaged. What happens after that I care
    not. The law cannot wrest the old fool&rsquo;s fortune from me, once I have
    destroyed her accursed will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To begin to tell you what passed in my mind then were an impossibility.
    Did I actually guess what would happen, and what my dear lady had planned?
    Or was it merely the ingrafted sympathy which exists between her and me which
    caused me to act blindly in accordance with her wishes?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fall in with their views. Take their bribes,&rdquo; she had said,
    and I&mdash;like a soldier&mdash;obeyed this command to the letter.</p>
  <p>I remained absolutely still, scarcely moving an eyelid as I watched the
    face of the clock, the minutes speeding on&mdash;now three&mdash;now five&mdash;now
    ten&mdash;</p>
  <p>I could hear the Marquis&rsquo; stertorous breathing close beside me.</p>
  <p>Was I dreaming, or did I really see now a dark line&mdash;the width of a
    hair&mdash;between the massive double doors of the clock case? Oh, how my
    pulses throbbed!</p>
  <p>That dark line was widening perceptibly. The doors were slowly opening!
    For the moment I almost felt in sympathy with the blackguard who was on the
    watch with me. His agitation must have been the most exquisite torture.</p>
  <p>Now we could distinctly see the glimmer of white paper&mdash;not pressed
    down by the ponderous weights, but lying loosely just inside the doors; and
    anon, as the aperture widened, the papers fell out just at my feet.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page164.jpg" width="540" height="750"></p>
  <p>With a smothered, gurgling exclamation which I will not attempt to describe,
    the Marquis literally fell on that paper, like a hungry wild beast upon its
    prey. He was on his knees before me, and I could see that the paper was a
    square envelope, which, with a trembling hand, he tore open.</p>
  <p>It contained a short document whereon the signature &ldquo;Am&eacute;d&eacute; de
    Terhoven&rdquo;  was clearly visible. It was the confession of forgery made
    by the young Marquis just a year ago; there were also a few banknotes: some
    hundred thousand francs, perhaps. The young man threw them furiously aside,
    and once more turned to the clock. The doors were wide open, but they revealed
    nothing save the huge and complicated mechanism of the clock.</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle de Genneville&mdash;eccentric and far-seeing to the last&mdash;had
    played this gigantic hoax on her scheming relatives. Whilst they directed
    all their unscrupulous energies towards trying to obtain possession of her
    will in one place, she had calmly put it securely somewhere else.</p>
  <p>Meantime, Monsieur le Marquis had sufficient presence of mind, and, I must
    own, sufficient dignity, not only to release me from my bonds but also to
    offer me the fifty thousand francs which he had promised me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can wind up the clock now,&rdquo; he said dully, &ldquo;and you
    can walk straight out of this place. No one need know that you impersonated
    your friend. She, no doubt, knew of this&mdash;hoax; therefore we found the
    scheme to keep her out of the way so easy of accomplishment. It was a grisly
    joke, wasn&rsquo;t it? How the old witch must be chortling in her grave! &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Needless to say, I did not take his money. He escorted me downstairs silently,
    subdued, no doubt, by the spirit of hatred which had followed him up from
    the land of shadows.</p>
  <p>He even showed no surprise when, on reaching the hall, he was met by his
    late aunt&rsquo;s lawyer, Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me, and also by Lady Molly,
    who had just arrived. Madame la Marquise de Terhoven was nowhere to be seen.</p>
  <p>My dear lady smiled at me approvingly, and when I came near her she contrived
    to draw me aside and to whisper hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have done admirably, Mary. I came to fetch you. But now that
    this young blackguard is thoroughly outwitted, we may as well go, for our
    work here is done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Marquis did not even glance at her as she slightly bowed her head to
    him, took leave of Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me, and finally walked out of
    the ch&acirc;teau with me.</p>
  <p>As soon as we were out in the open air I begged for an explanation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma&icirc;tre Vend&ocirc;me has Mademoiselle&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; she
    replied. &ldquo;She had enjoined him to read it in the ch&acirc;teau to-day
    in the presence of the three trustees appointed for the poor of Porho&euml;t,
    who inherit all her wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the Terhovens?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got his confession back,&rdquo; she said dryly, &ldquo;and
    they will receive an annuity from the trustees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you knew this all along?&rdquo; I rejoined somewhat reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so did the Cur&eacute;, but Mademoiselle made me swear a most
    solemn oath not to reveal her secret even to you; she was so afraid of the
    machinations of the Terhovens. You see,&rdquo; continued Lady Molly, smiling
    at my eagerness, &ldquo;Miss de Genneville possessed the ancient key wherewith
    she could open the clock case at any time. Obviously, even so perfect a piece
    of mechanism might go wrong, when examination and re-adjustment of the works
    would be necessary. After the family conclave wherein she had announced that
    her will was hidden in the clock, I&mdash;at my next interview with her&mdash;begged
    her to modify this idea, to send her will to her solicitor, but to leave
    the Terhovens under the impression that it was still lying in its strange
    hiding place. At first she refused to listen to me or to discuss the subject,
    but I am happy to say that I finally succeeded in persuading her, with what
    result you already know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But poor Monsieur le Cur&eacute;!&rdquo; I ejaculated.</p>
  <p>Her bright eyes gleamed with merriment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! that was a final little hoax. He himself, poor dear, was afraid
    lest he might blurt out the whole thing. His illness was partly a sham, and
    he is quite all right again now, but the doctor at the Brest hospital is
    a great friend of his, and is keeping him there until all this business has
    blown over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was the only one who was kept in the dark,&rdquo; I concluded ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary, dear,&rdquo; said my dear lady, gently; &ldquo;it was
    a promise, remember. But I never thought that we should get so much excitement
    outside our own professional work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It certainly had been a non-professional experience; but here, too, as in
    the detection of crime, her keen intuition had proved more than a match for
    an unscrupulous blackguard, and certainly on the 20th day of September last
    I lived through the most exciting ten minutes of my life.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AChristmasTragedy"></a>A Christmas Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p>IT was a fairly merry Christmas party, although the surliness of our host
    somewhat marred the festivities. But imagine two such beautiful young women
    as my own dear lady and Margaret Ceely, and a Christmas Eve Cinderella in
    the beautiful ball-room at Clevere Hall, and you will understand that even
    Major Ceely&rsquo;s well-known cantankerous temper could not altogether spoil
    the merriment of a good, old-fashioned, festive gathering.</p>
  <p>It is a far cry from a Christmas Eve party to a series of cattle-maiming
    outrages, yet I am forced to mention these now, for although they were ultimately
    proved to have no connection with the murder of the unfortunate Major, yet
    they were undoubtedly the means whereby the miscreant was enabled to accomplish
    the horrible deed with surety, swiftness, and&mdash;as it turned out afterwards&mdash;a
    very grave chance of immunity.</p>
  <p>Everyone in the neighbourhood had been taking the keenest possible interest
    in those dastardly outrages against innocent animals. They were either the
    work of desperate ruffians who stick at nothing in order to obtain a few
    shillings, or else of madmen with weird propensities for purposeless crimes.</p>
  <p>Once or twice suspicious characters had been seen lurking about in the fields,
    and on more than one occasion a cart was heard in the middle of the night
    driving away at furious speed. Whenever this occurred the discovery of a
    fresh outrage was sure to follow, but, so far, the miscreants had succeeded
    in baffling not only the police, but also the many farm hands who had formed
    themselves into a band of volunteer watchmen, determined to bring the cattle
    maimers to justice.</p>
  <p>We had all been talking about these mysterious events during the dinner
    which preceded the dance at Clevere Hall; but later on, when the young people
    had assembled, and when the first strains of &ldquo;The Merry Widow&rdquo; waltz
    had set us aglow with prospective enjoyment, the unpleasant topic was wholly
    forgotten.</p>
  <p>The guests went away early, Major Ceely, as usual, doing nothing to detain
    them; and by midnight all of us who were staying in the house had gone up
    to bed.</p>
  <p>My dear lady and I shared a bedroom and dressing-room together, our windows
    giving on the front. Clevere Hall is, as you know, not very far from York,
    on the other side of Bishopthorpe, and is one of the finest old mansions
    in the neighbourhood, its only disadvantage being that, in spite of the gardens
    being very extensive in the rear, the front of the house lies very near the
    road.</p>
  <p>It was about two hours after I had switched off the electric light and called
    out &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to my dear lady, that something roused me out
    of my first sleep. Suddenly I felt very wide-awake, and sat up in bed. Most
    unmistakably&mdash; though still from some considerable distance along the
    road&mdash;came the sound of a cart being driven at unusual speed.</p>
  <p>Evidently my dear lady was also awake. She jumped out of bed and, drawing
    aside the curtains, looked out of the window. The same idea had, of course,
    flashed upon us both, at the very moment of waking: all the conversations
    anent the cattle-maimers and their cart, which we had heard since our arrival
    at Clevere, recurring to our minds simultaneously.</p>
  <p>I had joined Lady Molly beside the window, and I don&rsquo;t know how many
    minutes we remained there in observation, not more than two probably, for
    anon the sound of the cart died away in the distance along a side road. Suddenly
    we were startled with a terrible cry of &ldquo;Murder! Help! Help!&rdquo; issuing
    from the other side of the house, followed by an awful, deadly silence. I
    stood there near the window shivering with terror, while my dear lady, having
    already turned on the light, was hastily slipping into some clothes.</p>
  <p>The cry had, of course, aroused the entire household, but my dear lady was
    even then the first to get downstairs, and to reach the garden door at the
    back of the house, whence the weird and despairing cry had undoubtedly proceeded.</p>
  <p>That door was wide open. Two steps lead from it to the terraced walk which
    borders the house on that side, and along these steps Major Ceely was lying,
    face downwards, with arms outstretched, and a terrible wound between his
    shoulder-blades.</p>
  <p>A gun was lying close by&mdash;his own. It was easy to conjecture that he,
    too, hearing the rumble of the wheels, had run out, gun in hand, meaning,
    no doubt, to effect, or at least to help, in the capture of the escaping
    criminals. Someone had been lying in wait for him; that was obvious&mdash;someone
    who had perhaps waited and watched for this special opportunity for days,
    or even weeks, in order to catch the unfortunate man unawares.</p>
  <p>Well, it were useless to recapitulate all the various little incidents which
    occurred from the moment when Lady Molly and the butler first lifted the
    Major&rsquo;s lifeless body from the terrace steps until that instant when
    Miss Ceely, with remarkable coolness and presence of mind, gave what details
    she could of the terrible event to the local police inspector and to the
    doctor, both hastily summoned.</p>
  <p>These little incidents, with but slight variations, occur in every instance
    when a crime has been committed. The broad facts alone are of weird and paramount
    interest.</p>
  <p>Major Ceely was dead. He had been stabbed with amazing sureness and terrible
    violence in the back. The weapon used must have been some sort of heavy,
    clasp knife. The murdered man was now lying in his own bedroom upstairs,
    even as the Christmas bells on that cold, crisp morning sent cheering echoes
    through the stillness of the air.</p>
  <p>We had, of course, left the house, as had all the other guests. Everyone
    felt the deepest possible sympathy for the beautiful young girl who had been
    so full of the joy of living but a few hours ago, and was now the pivot round
    which revolved the weird shadow of tragedy, of curious suspicions and of
    an ever-growing mystery. But at such times all strangers, acquaintances,
    and even friends in a house, are only an additional burden to an already
    overwhelming load of sorrow and of trouble.</p>
  <p>We took up our quarters at the &ldquo;Black Swan,&rdquo; in York. The local
    superintendent, hearing that Lady Molly had been actually a guest at Clevere
    on the night of the murder, had asked her to remain in the neighbourhood.</p>
  <p>There was no doubt that she could easily obtain the chief&rsquo;s consent
    to assist the local police in the elucidation of this extraordinary crime.
    At this time both her reputation and her remarkable powers were at their
    zenith, and there was not a single member of the entire police force in the
    kingdom who would not have availed himself gladly of her help when confronted
    with a seemingly impenetrable mystery.</p>
  <p>That the murder of Major Ceely threatened to become such no one could deny.
    In cases of this sort, when no robbery of any kind has accompanied the graver
    crime, it is the duty of the police and also of the coroner to try to find
    out, first and foremost, what possible motive there could be behind so cowardly
    an assault; and among motives, of course, deadly hatred, revenge, and animosity
    stand paramount.</p>
  <p>But here the police were at once confronted with the terrible difficulty,
    not of discovering whether Major Ceely had an enemy at all, but rather which,
    of all those people who owed him a grudge, hated him sufficiently to risk
    hanging for the sake of getting him out of the way.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, the unfortunate Major was one of those miserable people
    who seem to live in a state of perpetual enmity with everything and everybody.
    Morning, noon and night he grumbled, and when he did not grumble he quarreled
    either with his own daughter or with the people of his household, or with
    his neighbours.</p>
  <p>I had often heard about him and his eccentric, disagreeable ways from Lady
    Molly, who had known him for many years. She&mdash;like everybody in the
    county who otherwise would have shunned the old man&mdash;kept up a semblance
    of friendship with him for the sake of the daughter.</p>
  <p>Margaret Ceely was a singularly beautiful girl, and as the Major was reputed
    to be very wealthy, these two facts perhaps combined to prevent the irascible
    gentleman from living in quite so complete an isolation as he would have
    wished.</p>
  <p>Mammas of marriageable young men vied with one another in their welcome
    to Miss Ceely at garden parties, dances and bazaars. Indeed, Margaret had
    been surrounded with admirers ever since she had come out of the schoolroom.
    Needless to say, the cantankerous Major received these pretenders to his
    daughter&rsquo;s hand not only with insolent disdain, but at times even with
    violent opposition.</p>
  <p>In spite of this the moths fluttered round the candle, and amongst this
    venturesome tribe none stood out more prominently than Mr. Laurence Smethick,
    son of the M.P. for the Pakethorpe division. Some folk there were who vowed
    that the young people were secretly engaged, in spite of the fact that Margaret
    was an outrageous flirt and openly encouraged more than one of her crowd
    of adorers.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, one thing was very certain&mdash;namely, that Major Ceely
    did not approve of Mr. Smethick any more than he did of the others, and there
    had been more than one quarrel between the young man and his prospective
    father-in-law.</p>
  <p>On that memorable Christmas Eve at Clevere none of us could fail to notice
    his absence; whilst Margaret, on the other hand, had shown marked predilection
    for the society of Captain Glynne, who, since the sudden death of his cousin,
    Viscount Heslington, Lord Ullesthorpe&rsquo;s only son (who was killed in
    the hunting field last October, if you remember), had become heir to the
    earldom and its &pound;40,000 a year.</p>
  <p>Personally, I strongly disapproved of Margaret&rsquo;s behaviour the night
    of the dance; her attitude with regard to Mr. Smethick&mdash;whose constant
    attendance on her had justified the rumour that they were engaged&mdash;being
    more than callous.</p>
  <p>On that morning of December 24th&mdash;Christmas Eve, in fact&mdash;the
    young man had called at Clevere. I remember seeing him just as he was being
    shown into the boudoir downstairs. A few moments later the sound of angry
    voices rose with appalling distinctness from that room. We all tried not
    to listen, yet could not fail to hear Major Ceely&rsquo;s overbearing words
    of rudeness to the visitor, who, it seems, had merely asked to see Miss Ceely,
    and had been most unexpectedly confronted by the irascible and extremely
    disagreeable Major. Of course, the young man speedily lost his temper, too,
    and the whole incident ended with a very unpleasant quarrel between the two
    men in the hall, and with the Major peremptorily forbidding Mr. Smethick
    ever to darken his doors again.</p>
  <p>On that night Major Ceely was murdered.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Of course, at first, no one attached any importance to this weird coincidence.
    The very thought of connecting the idea of murder with that of the personality
    of a bright, good-looking young Yorkshireman like Mr. Smethick seemed, indeed,
    preposterous, and with one accord all of us who were practically witnesses
    to the quarrel between the two men, tacitly agreed to say nothing at all
    about it at the inquest, unless we were absolutely obliged to do so on oath.</p>
  <p>In view of the Major&rsquo;s terrible temper, this quarrel, mind you, had
    not the importance which it otherwise would have had; and we all flattered
    ourselves that we had well succeeded in parrying the coroner&rsquo;s questions.</p>
  <p>The verdict at the inquest was against some person or persons unknown; and
    I, for one, was very glad that young Smethick&rsquo;s name had not been mentioned
    in connection with this terrible crime.</p>
  <p>Two days later the superintendent at Bishopthorpe sent an urgent telephonic
    message to Lady Molly, begging her to come to the police-station immediately.
    We had the use of a motor all the while that we stayed at the &ldquo;Black
    Swan,&rdquo; and in less than ten minutes we were bowling along at express
    speed towards Bishopthorpe.</p>
  <p>On arrival we were immediately shown into Superintendent Etty&rsquo;s private
    room behind the office. He was there talking with Danvers&mdash;who had recently
    come down from London. In a corner of the room, sitting very straight on
    a high-backed chair, was a youngish woman of the servant class, who, as we
    entered, cast a quick, and I thought suspicious, glance at us both.</p>
  <p>She was dressed in a coat and skirt of shabby-looking black, and although
    her face might have been called good-looking&mdash;for she had fine, dark
    eyes&mdash;her entire appearance was distinctly repellent. It suggested slatternliness
    in an unusual degree; there were holes in her shoes and in her stockings,
    the sleeve of her coat was half unsewn, and the braid on her skirt hung in
    loops all round the bottom. She had very red and very coarse-looking hands,
    and undoubtedly there was a furtive expression in her eyes, which, when she
    began speaking, changed to one of defiance.</p>
  <p>Etty came forward with great alacrity when my dear lady entered. He looked
    perturbed, and seemed greatly relieved at sight of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is the wife of one of the outdoor men at Clevere,&rdquo; he explained
    rapidly to Lady Molly, nodding in the direction of the young woman, &ldquo;and
    she has come here with such a queer tale that I thought you would like to
    hear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She knows something about the murder?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Noa! I didn&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; here interposed the woman, roughly, &ldquo;doan&rsquo;t
    you go and tell no lies, Master Inspector. I thought as how you might wish
    to know what my husband saw on the night when the Major was murdered, that&rsquo;s
    all; and I&rsquo;ve come to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t your husband come himself?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Haggett ain&rsquo;t well enough&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo; she began
    explaining, with a careless shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;so to speak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is, my lady,&rdquo; interposed Etty, &ldquo;this
    woman&rsquo;s husband is half-witted. I believe he is only kept on in the
    garden because he is very strong and can help with the digging. It is because
    his testimony is so little to be relied on that I wished to consult you as
    to how we should act in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is his testimony, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell this lady what you have just told us, Mrs. Haggett, will you?&rdquo;  said
    Etty, curtly.</p>
  <p>Again that quick, suspicious glance shot into the woman&rsquo;s eyes. Lady
    Molly took the chair which Danvers had brought forward for her, and sat down
    opposite Mrs. Haggett, fixing her earnest, calm gaze upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to tell,&rdquo; said the woman, sullenly. &ldquo;Haggett
    is certainly queer in his head sometimes&mdash;and when he is queer he goes
    wandering about the place of nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said my lady, for Mrs. Haggett had paused awhile and
    now seemed unwilling to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she resumed with sudden determination, &ldquo;he had
    got one of his queer fits on Christmas Eve, and didn&rsquo;t come in till
    long after midnight. He told me as how he&rsquo;d seen a young gentleman
    prowling about the garden on the terrace side. He heard the cry of &lsquo;Murder&rsquo; and &lsquo;Help&rsquo; soon
    after that, and ran in home because he was frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly, quietly, &ldquo;where is home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cottage where we live. Just back of the kitchen garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell all this to the superintendent before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because Haggett only told me last night, when he seemed less queer-like.
    He is mighty silent when the fits are on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he know who the gentleman was whom he saw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose he did&mdash;leastways
    he wouldn&rsquo;t say&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? But?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He found this in the garden yesterday,&rdquo; said the woman, holding
    out a screw of paper which apparently she had held tightly clutched up to
    now, &ldquo;and maybe that&rsquo;s what brought Christmas Eve and the murder
    back to his mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly took the thing from her, and undid the soiled bit of paper with
    her dainty fingers. The next moment she held up for Etty&rsquo;s inspection
    a beautiful ring composed of an exquisitely carved moonstone surrounded with
    diamonds of unusual brilliance.</p>
  <p>At the moment the setting and the stones themselves were marred by scraps
    of sticky mud which clung to them; the ring obviously having lain on the
    ground, and perhaps been trampled on for some days, and then been only very
    partially washed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate you can find out the ownership of the ring,&rdquo; commented
    my dear lady after awhile, in answer to Etty&rsquo;s silent attitude of expectancy. &ldquo;There
    would be no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she turned once more to the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk with you to your cottage, if I may,&rdquo; she said
    decisively,  &ldquo;and have a chat with your husband. Is he at home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought Mrs. Haggett took this suggestion with marked reluctance. I could
    well imagine, from her own personal appearance, that her home was most unlikely
    to be in a fit state for a lady&rsquo;s visit. However, she could, of course,
    do nothing but obey, and, after a few muttered words of grudging acquiescence,
    she rose from her chair and stalked towards the door, leaving my lady to
    follow as she chose.</p>
  <p>Before going, however, she turned and shot an angry glance at Etty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give me back the ring, Master Inspector,&rdquo; she
    said with her usual tone of sullen defiance. &ldquo;&lsquo;Findings is keepings&rsquo; you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; replied Etty, curtly; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
    always the reward offered by Miss Ceely for information which would lead
    to the apprehension of her father&rsquo;s murderer. You may get that, you
    know. It is a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I knew that,&rdquo; she remarked dryly, as, without further
    comment, she finally went out of the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>My dear lady came back very disappointed from her interview with Haggett.</p>
  <p>It seems that he was indeed half-witted&mdash;almost an imbecile, in fact,
    with but a few lucid intervals, of which this present day was one. But, of
    course, his testimony was practically valueless.</p>
  <p>He reiterated the story already told by his wife, adding no details. He
    had seen a young gentleman roaming on the terraced walk on the night of the
    murder. He did not know who the young gentleman was. He was going homewards
    when he heard the cry of &ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; and ran to his cottage because
    he was frightened. He picked up the ring yesterday in the perennial border
    below the terrace and gave it to his wife.</p>
  <p>Two of these brief statements made by the imbecile were easily proved to
    be true, and my dear lady had ascertained this before she returned to me.
    One of the Clevere under-gardeners said he had seen Haggett running home
    in the small hours of that fateful Christmas morning. He himself had been
    on the watch for the cattle-maimers that night, and remembered the little
    circumstance quite plainly. He added that Haggett certainly looked to be
    in a panic.</p>
  <p>Then Newby, another outdoor man at the Hall, saw Haggett pick up the ring
    in the perennial border and advised him to take it to the police.</p>
  <p>Somehow, all of us who were so interested in that terrible Christmas tragedy
    felt strangely perturbed at all this. No names had been mentioned as yet,
    but whenever my dear lady and I looked at one another, or whenever we talked
    to Etty or Danvers, we all felt that a certain name, one particular personality,
    was lurking at the back of all our minds.</p>
  <p>The two men, of course, had no sentimental scruples to worry them. Taking
    the Haggett story merely as a clue, they worked diligently on that, with
    the result that twenty-four hours later Etty appeared in our private room
    at the  &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; and calmly informed us that he had just
    got a warrant out against Mr. Laurence Smethick on a charge of murder, and
    was on his way even now to effect the arrest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Smethick did <i>not</i> murder Major Ceely,&rdquo; was Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    firm and only comment when she heard the news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my lady, that&rsquo;s as it may be!&rdquo; rejoined Etty, speaking
    with that deference with which the entire force invariably addressed my dear
    lady; &ldquo;but we have collected a sufficiency of evidence, at any rate,
    to justify the arrest, and, in my opinion, enough of it to hang any man.
    Mr. Smethick purchased the moonstone and diamond ring at Nicholson&rsquo;s
    in Coney Street about a week ago. He was seen abroad on Christmas Eve by
    several persons, loitering round the gates at Clevere Hall, somewhere about
    the time when the guests were leaving after the dance, and, again, some few
    moments after the first cry of &lsquo;Murder&rsquo; had been heard. His own
    valet admits that his master did not get home that night until long after
    2.0 a.m., whilst even Miss Granard here won&rsquo;t deny that there was a
    terrible quarrel between Mr. Smethick and Major Ceely less than twenty-four
    hours before the latter was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly offered no remark to this array of facts which Etty thus pitilessly
    marshalled before us, but I could not refrain from exclaiming:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Smethick is innocent, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope, for his sake, he may be,&rdquo; retorted Etty, gravely, &ldquo;but
    somehow  &rsquo;tis a pity that he don&rsquo;t seem able to give a good account
    of himself between midnight and two o&rsquo;clock that Christmas morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I ejaculated, &ldquo;what does he say about that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the man dryly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the
    trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, of course, as you who read the papers will doubtless remember, Mr.
    Laurence Smethick, son of Colonel Smethick, M.P., of Pakethorpe Hall, Yorks,
    was arrested on the charge of having murdered Major Ceely on the night of
    December 24th-25th, and, after the usual magisterial inquiry, was duly committed
    to stand his trial at the next York assizes.</p>
  <p>I remember well that, throughout his preliminary ordeal, young Smethick
    bore himself like one who had given up all hope of refuting the terrible
    charges brought against him, and, I must say, the formidable number of witnesses
    which the police brought up against him more than explained that attitude.</p>
  <p>Of course, Haggett was not called, but, as it happened, there were plenty
    of people to swear that Mr. Laurence Smethick was seen loitering round the
    gates of Clevere Hall after the guests had departed on Christmas Eve. The
    head gardener, who lives at the lodge actually spoke to him, and Captain
    Glynne, leaning out of his brougham, was heard to exclaim:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Smethick, what are you doing here at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there were others, too.</p>
  <p>To Captain Glynne&rsquo;s credit, be it here recorded, he tried his best
    to deny having recognized his unfortunate friend in the dark. Pressed by
    the magistrate, he said obstinately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought at the time that it was Mr. Smethick standing by the lodge
    gates, but on thinking the matter over I feel sure that I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the other hand, what stood dead against young Smethick was, firstly,
    the question of the ring, and then the fact that he was seen in the immediate
    neighbourhood of Clevere, both at midnight and again at about two, when some
    men, who had been on the watch for the cattle-maimers, saw him walking away
    rapidly in the direction of Pakethorpe.</p>
  <p>What was, of course, unexplainable and very terrible to witness was Mr.
    Smethick&rsquo;s obstinate silence with regard to his own movements during
    those fatal hours on that night. He did not contradict those who said that
    they had seen him at about midnight near the gates of Clevere, nor his own
    valet&rsquo;s statements as to the hour when he returned home. All he said
    was that he could not account for what he did between the time when the guests
    left the Hall and he himself went back to Pakethorpe. He realized the danger
    in which he stood, and what caused him to be silent about a matter which
    might mean life or death to him could not easily be conjectured.</p>
  <p>The ownership of the ring he could not and did not dispute. He had lost
    it in the grounds of Clevere, he said. But the jeweller in Coney Street swore
    that he had sold the ring to Mr. Smethick on the 8th of December, whilst
    it was a well-known and an admitted fact that the young man had not openly
    been inside the gates of Clevere for over a fortnight before that.</p>
  <p>On this evidence Laurence Smethick was committed for trial. Though the actual
    weapon with which the unfortunate Major had been stabbed had not been found,
    nor its ownership traced, there was such a vast array of circumstantial evidence
    against the young man that bail was refused.</p>
  <p>He had, on the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Grayson&mdash;one of the ablest
    lawyers in York&mdash;reserved his defence, and on that miserable afternoon
    at the close of the year, we all filed out of the crowded court, feeling
    terribly depressed and anxious.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>My dear lady and I walked back to our hotel in silence. Our hearts seemed
    to weigh heavily within us. We felt mortally sorry for that good-looking
    young Yorkshireman, who, we were convinced, was innocent, yet at the same
    time seemed involved in a tangled web of deadly circumstances from which
    he seemed quite unable to extricate himself.</p>
  <p>We did not feel like discussing the matter in the open streets, neither
    did we make any comment when presently, in a block in the traffic in Coney
    Street, we saw Margaret Ceely driving her smart dog-cart, whilst sitting
    beside her, and talking with great earnestness close to her ear, sat Captain
    Glynne.</p>
  <p>She was in deep mourning, and had obviously been doing some shopping, for
    she was surrounded with parcels; so perhaps it was hypercritical to blame
    her. Yet somehow it struck me that just at the moment when there hung in
    the balance the life and honour of a man with whose name her own had oft
    been linked by popular rumour, it showed more than callous contempt for his
    welfare to be seen driving about with another man who, since his sudden access
    to fortune, had undoubtedly become a rival in her favours.</p>
  <p>When we arrived at the &ldquo;Black Swan,&rdquo; we were surprised to hear
    that Mr. Grayson had called to see my dear lady, and was upstairs waiting.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly ran up to our sitting-room and greeted him with marked cordiality.
    Mr. Grayson is an elderly dry-looking man, but he looked visibly affected,
    and it was some time before he seemed able to plunge into the subject which
    had brought him hither. He fidgeted in his chair, and started talking about
    the weather.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not here in a strictly professional capacity, you know,&rdquo; said
    Lady Molly presently, with a kindly smile and with a view to helping him
    out of his embarrassment. &ldquo;Our police, I fear me, have an exaggerated
    view of my capacities, and the men here asked me unofficially to remain in
    the neighbourhood and to give them my advice if they should require it. Our
    chief is very lenient to me and has allowed me to stay. Therefore, if there
    is anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed there is!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Grayson with sudden
    energy.  &ldquo;From all I hear, there is not another soul in the kingdom
    but you who can save this innocent man from the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My dear lady heaved a little sigh of satisfaction. She had all along wanted
    to have a more important finger in that Yorkshire pie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Smethick?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; my unfortunate young client,&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;I
    may as well tell you,&rdquo; he resumed after a slight pause, during which
    he seemed to pull himself together, &ldquo;as briefly as possible what occurred
    on December 24th last and on the following Christmas morning. You will then
    understand the terrible plight in which my client finds himself, and how
    impossible it is for him to explain his actions on that eventful night. You
    will understand, also, why I have come to ask your help and your advice.
    Mr. Smethick considered himself engaged to Miss Ceely. The engagement had
    not been made public because of Major Ceely&rsquo;s anticipated opposition,
    but the young people had been very intimate, and many letters had passed
    between them. On the morning of the 24th Mr. Smethick called at the Hall,
    his intention then being merely to present his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> with
    the ring you know of. You remember the unfortunate <i>contretemps</i> that
    occurred: I mean the unprovoked quarrel sought by Major Ceely with my poor
    client, ending with the irascible old man forbidding Mr. Smethick the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My client walked out of Clevere feeling, as you may well imagine,
    very wrathful; on the doorstep, just as he was leaving, he met Miss Margaret,
    and told her very briefly what had occurred. She took the matter very lightly
    at first, but finally became more serious, and ended the brief interview
    with the request that, since he could not come to the dance after what had
    occurred, he should come and see her afterwards, meeting her in the gardens
    soon after midnight. She would not take the ring from him then, but talked
    a good deal of sentiment about Christmas morning, asking him to bring the
    ring to her at night, and also the letters which she had written him. Well&mdash;you
    can guess the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly nodded thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Ceely was playing a double game,&rdquo; continued Mr. Grayson,
    earnestly.  &ldquo;She was determined to break off all relationship with
    Mr. Smethick, for she had transferred her volatile affections to Captain
    Glynne, who had lately become heir to an earldom and &pound;40,000 a year.
    Under the guise of sentimental twaddle she got my unfortunate client to meet
    her at night in the grounds of Clevere and to give up to her the letters
    which might have compromised her in the eyes of her new lover. At two o&rsquo;clock
    a.m. Major Ceely was murdered by one of his numerous enemies; as to which
    I do not know, nor does Mr. Smethick. He had just parted from Miss Ceely
    at the very moment when the first cry of &lsquo;Murder&rsquo; roused Clevere
    from its slumbers. This she could confirm if she only would, for the two
    were still in sight of each other, she inside the gates, he just a little
    way down the road. Mr. Smethick saw Margaret Ceely run rapidly back towards
    the house. He waited about a little while, half hesitating what to do; then
    he reflected that his presence might be embarrassing, or even compromising
    to her whom, in spite of all, he still loved dearly; and knowing that there
    were plenty of men in and about the house to render what assistance was necessary,
    he finally turned his steps and went home a broken-hearted man, since she
    had given him the go-by, taken her letters away, and flung contemptuously
    into the mud the ring he had bought for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lawyer paused, mopping his forehead and gazing with whole-souled earnestness
    at my lady&rsquo;s beautiful, thoughtful face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Smethick spoken to Miss Ceely since?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly,
    after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I did,&rdquo; replied the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was her attitude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of bitter and callous contempt. She denies my unfortunate client&rsquo;s
    story from beginning to end; declares that she never saw him after she bade
    him  &lsquo;good-morning&rsquo; on the doorstep of Clevere Hall, when she
    heard of his unfortunate quarrel with her father. Nay, more; she scornfully
    calls the whole tale a cowardly attempt to shield a dastardly crime behind
    a still more dastardly libel on a defenceless girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were all silent now, buried in thought which none of us would have cared
    to translate into words. That the <i>impasse</i> seemed indeed hopeless no
    one could deny.</p>
  <p>The tower of damning evidence against the unfortunate young man had indeed
    been built by remorseless circumstances with no faltering hand.</p>
  <p>Margaret Ceely alone could have saved him, but with brutal indifference
    she preferred the sacrifice of an innocent man&rsquo;s life and honour to
    that of her own chances of a brilliant marriage. There are such women in
    the world; thank God I have never met any but that one!</p>
  <p>Yet am I wrong when I say that she alone could save the unfortunate young
    man, who throughout was behaving with such consummate gallantry, refusing
    to give his own explanation of the events that occurred on that Christmas
    morning, unless she chose first to tell the tale. There was one present now
    in the dingy little room at the &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; who could disentangle
    that weird skein of coincidences, if any human being not gifted with miraculous
    powers could indeed do it at this eleventh hour.</p>
  <p>She now said, gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would you like me to do in this matter, Mr. Grayson? And why
    have you come to me rather than to the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I go with this tale to the police?&rdquo; he ejaculated in
    obvious despair. &ldquo;Would they not also look upon it as a dastardly libel
    on a woman&rsquo;s reputation? We have no proofs, remember, and Miss Ceely
    denies the whole story from first to last. No, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed with
    wonderful fervour. &ldquo;I came to you because I have heard of your marvellous
    gifts, your extraordinary intuition. Someone murdered Major Ceely! It was
    not my old friend Colonel Smethick&rsquo;s son. Find out who it was, then!
    I beg of you, find out who it was!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He fell back in his chair broken down with grief. With inexpressible gentleness
    Lady Molly went up to him and placed her beautiful white hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do my best, Mr. Grayson,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>We remained alone and singularly quiet the whole of that evening. That my
    dear lady&rsquo;s active brain was hard at work I could guess by the brilliance
    of her eyes, and that sort of absolute stillness in her person through which
    one could almost feel the delicate nerves vibrating.</p>
  <p>The story told her by the lawyer had moved her singularly. Mind you, she
    had always been morally convinced of young Smethick&rsquo;s innocence, but
    in her the professional woman always fought hard battles against the sentimentalist,
    and in this instance the overwhelming circumstantial evidence and the conviction
    of her superiors had forced her to accept the young man&rsquo;s guilt as
    something out of her ken.</p>
  <p>By his silence, too, the young man had tacitly confessed; and if a man is
    perceived on the very scene of a crime, both before it has been committed
    and directly afterwards; if something admittedly belonging to him is found
    within three yards of where the murderer must have stood; if, added to this,
    he has had a bitter quarrel with the victim, and can give no account of his
    actions or whereabouts during the fatal time, it were vain to cling to optimistic
    beliefs in that same man&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
  <p>But now matters had assumed an altogether different aspect. The story told
    by Mr. Smethick&rsquo;s lawyer had all the appearance of truth. Margaret
    Ceely&rsquo;s character, her callousness on the very day when her late <i>fianc&eacute;</i> stood
    in the dock, her quick transference of her affections to the richer man,
    all made the account of the events on Christmas night as told by Mr. Grayson
    extremely plausible.</p>
  <p>No wonder my dear lady was buried in thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to take the threads up from the beginning, Mary,&rdquo; she
    said to me the following morning, when after breakfast she appeared in her
    neat coat and skirt, with hat and gloves, ready to go out, &ldquo;so, on
    the whole, I think I will begin with a visit to the Haggetts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may come with you, I suppose?&rdquo; I suggested meekly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she rejoined carelessly.</p>
  <p>Somehow I had an inkling that the carelessness of her mood was only on the
    surface. It was not likely that she&mdash;my sweet, womanly, ultra-feminine,
    beautiful lady&mdash;should feel callously on this absorbing subject.</p>
  <p>We motored down to Bishopthorpe. It was bitterly cold, raw, damp, and foggy.
    The chauffeur had some difficulty in finding the cottage, the &ldquo;home&rdquo; of
    the imbecile gardener and his wife.</p>
  <p>There was certainly not much look of home about the place. When, after much
    knocking at the door, Mrs. Haggett finally opened it, we saw before us one
    of the most miserable, slatternly places I think I ever saw.</p>
  <p>In reply to Lady Molly&rsquo;s somewhat curt inquiry, the woman said that
    Haggett was in bed, suffering from one of his &ldquo;fits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a great pity,&rdquo; said my dear lady, rather unsympathetically,
    I thought, &ldquo;for I must speak with him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it about?&rdquo; asked the woman, sullenly. &ldquo;I can
    take a message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; rejoined my lady. &ldquo;I was asked to see
    Haggett personally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom, I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; she retorted, now almost
    insolently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dare say you would. But you are wasting precious time. Hadn&rsquo;t
    you better help your husband on with his clothes? This lady and I will wait
    in the parlour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After some hesitation the woman finally complied, looking very sulky the
    while.</p>
  <p>We went into the miserable little room wherein not only grinding poverty
    but also untidiness and dirt were visible all round. We sat down on two of
    the cleanest-looking chairs, and waited whilst a colloquy in subdued voices
    went on in the room over our heads.</p>
  <p>The colloquy, I may say, seemed to consist of agitated whispers on one part,
    and wailing complaints on the other. This was followed presently by some
    thuds and much shuffling, and presently Haggett, looking uncared-for, dirty,
    and unkempt, entered the parlour, followed by his wife.</p>
  <p>He came forward, dragging his ill-shod feet and pulling nervously at his
    forelock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my lady, kindly; &ldquo;I am glad to see you down,
    Haggett, though I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t very good news for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss!&rdquo; murmured the man, obviously not quite comprehending
    what was said to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I represent the workhouse authorities,&rdquo; continued Lady Molly, &ldquo;and
    I thought we could arrange for you and your wife to come into the Union to-night,
    perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Union?&rdquo; here interposed the woman, roughly. &ldquo;What
    do you mean? We ain&rsquo;t going to the Union?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! but since you are not staying here,&rdquo; rejoined my lady,
    blandly,  &ldquo;you will find it impossible to get another situation for
    your husband in his present mental condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Ceely won&rsquo;t give us the go-by,&rdquo; she retorted defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She might wish to carry out her late father&rsquo;s intentions,&rdquo; said
    Lady Molly with seeming carelessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Major was a cruel, cantankerous brute,&rdquo; shouted the woman
    with unpremeditated violence. &ldquo;Haggett had served him faithfully for
    twelve years, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She checked herself abruptly, and cast one of her quick, furtive glances
    at Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>Her silence now had become as significant as her outburst of rage, and it
    was Lady Molly who concluded the phrase for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet he dismissed him without warning,&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; retorted the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The same people, no doubt, who declare that you and Haggett had a
    grudge against the Major for this dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; asserted Mrs. Haggett, doggedly; &ldquo;we
    gave information about Mr. Smethick having killed the Major because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Molly, quickly, &ldquo;but then Mr. Smethick
    did not murder Major Ceely, and your information therefore was useless!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then who killed the Major, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her manner was arrogant, coarse, and extremely unpleasant. I marvelled why
    my dear lady put up with it, and what was going on in that busy brain of
    hers. She looked quite urbane and smiling, whilst I wondered what in the
    world she meant by this story of the workhouse and the dismissal of Haggett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what none of us know!&rdquo; she now said lightly; &ldquo;some
    folks say it was your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They lie!&rdquo; she retorted quickly, whilst the imbecile, evidently
    not understanding the drift of the conversation, was mechanically stroking
    his red mop of hair and looking helplessly all round him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was home before the cries of &lsquo;Murder&rsquo; were heard in
    the house,&rdquo;  continued Mrs. Haggett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; you couldn&rsquo;t have heard the cries all the way to this
    cottage&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s over half a mile from the Hall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was home, I say,&rdquo; she repeated with dogged obstinacy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sent him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one will believe you, especially when the knife is found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What knife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His clasp knife, with which he killed Major Ceely,&rdquo; said Lady
    Molly, quietly; &ldquo;see, he has it in his hand now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a sudden, wholly unexpected gesture she pointed to the imbecile,
    who in an aimless way had prowled round the room whilst this rapid colloquy
    was going on.</p>
  <p>The purport of it all must in some sort of way have found an echo in his
    enfeebled brain. He wandered up to the dresser whereon lay the remnants of
    that morning&rsquo;s breakfast, together with some crockery and utensils.</p>
  <p>In that same half-witted and irresponsible way he had picked up one of the
    knives and now was holding it out towards his wife, whilst a look of fear
    spread over his countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, Annie, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;you&rsquo;d better
    do it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>There was dead silence in the little room. The woman Haggett stood as if
    turned to stone. Ignorant and superstitious as she was, I suppose that the
    situation had laid hold of her nerves, and that she felt that the finger
    of a relentless Fate was even now being pointed at her.</p>
  <p>The imbecile was shuffling forward, closer and closer to his wife, still
    holding out the knife towards her and murmuring brokenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it. You&rsquo;d better, Annie&mdash;you&rsquo;d
    better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was close to her now, and all at once her rigidity and nerve-strain gave
    way; she gave a hoarse cry, and snatching the knife from the poor wretch,
    she rushed at him ready to strike.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly and I were both young, active and strong; and there was nothing
    of the squeamish <i>grande dame</i> about my dear lady when quick action
    was needed. But even then we had some difficulty in dragging Annie Haggett
    away from her miserable husband. Blinded with fury, she was ready to kill
    the man who had betrayed her. Finally, we succeeded in wresting the knife
    from her.</p>
  <p>You may be sure that it required some pluck after that to sit down again
    quietly and to remain in the same room with this woman, who already had one
    crime upon her conscience, and with this weird, half-witted creature who
    kept on murmuring pitiably:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better do it, Annie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, you&rsquo;ve read the account of the case, so you know what followed.
    Lady Molly did not move from that room until she had obtained the woman&rsquo;s
    full confession. All she did for her own protection was to order me to open
    the window and to blow the police whistle which she handed to me. The police-station
    fortunately was not very far, and sound carried in the frosty air.</p>
  <p>She admitted to me afterwards that it had been foolish, perhaps, not to
    have brought Etty or Danvers with her, but she was supremely anxious not
    to put the woman on the alert from the very start, hence her circumlocutory
    speeches anent the workhouse, and Haggett&rsquo;s probable dismissal.</p>
  <p>That the woman had had some connection with the crime, Lady Molly, with
    her keen intuition, had always felt; but as there was no witness to the murder
    itself, and all circumstantial evidence was dead against young Smethick,
    there was only one chance of successful discovery, and that was the murderer&rsquo;s
    own confession.</p>
  <p>If you think over the interview between my dear lady and the Haggetts on
    that memorable morning, you will realise how admirably Lady Molly had led
    up to the weird finish. She would not speak to the woman unless Haggett was
    present, and she felt sure that as soon as the subject of the murder cropped
    up, the imbecile would either do or say something that would reveal the truth.</p>
  <p>Mechanically, when Major Ceely&rsquo;s name was mentioned, he had taken
    up the knife. The whole scene recurred to his tottering mind. That the Major
    had summarily dismissed him recently was one of those bold guesses which
    Lady Molly was wont to make.</p>
  <p>That Haggett had been merely egged on by his wife, and had been too terrified
    at the last to do the deed himself was no surprise to her, and hardly one
    to me, whilst the fact that the woman ultimately wreaked her own passionate
    revenge upon the unfortunate Major was hardly to be wondered at, in the face
    of her own coarse and elemental personality.</p>
  <p>Cowed by the quickness of events, and by the appearance of Danvers and Etty
    on the scene, she finally made full confession.</p>
  <p>She was maddened by the Major&rsquo;s brutality, when with rough, cruel
    words he suddenly turned her husband adrift, refusing to give him further
    employment. She herself had great ascendency over the imbecile, and had drilled
    him into a part of hate and of revenge. At first he had seemed ready and
    willing to obey. It was arranged that he was to watch on the terrace every
    night until such time as an alarm of the recurrence of the cattle-maiming
    outrages should lure the Major out alone.</p>
  <p>This effectually occurred on Christmas morning, but not before Haggett,
    frightened and pusillanimous, was ready to flee rather than to accomplish
    the villainous deed. But Annie Haggett, guessing perhaps that he would shrink
    from the crime at the last, had also kept watch every night. Picture the
    prospective murderer watching and being watched!</p>
  <p>When Haggett came across his wife he deputed her to do the deed herself.</p>
  <p>I suppose that either terror of discovery or merely desire for the promised
    reward had caused the woman to fasten the crime on another.</p>
  <p>The finding of the ring by Haggett was the beginning of that cruel thought
    which, but for my dear lady&rsquo;s marvellous powers, would indeed have
    sent a brave young man to the gallows.</p>
  <p>Ah, you wish to know if Margaret Ceely is married? No! Captain Glynne cried
    off. What suspicions crossed his mind I cannot say; but he never proposed
    to Margaret, and now she is in Australia&mdash;staying with an aunt, I think&mdash;and
    she has sold Clevere Hall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBagOfSand"></a>The Bag Of Sand</b></h2>
  <p>OF course, I knew at once by the expression of her face that morning that
    my dear lady had some important business on hand.</p>
  <p>She had a bundle in her arms, consisting of a shabby-looking coat and skirt,
    and a very dowdy hat trimmed with bunches of cheap, calico roses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put on these things at once, Mary,&rdquo; she said curtly, &ldquo;for
    you are going to apply for the situation of &lsquo;good plain cook,&rsquo; so
    mind you look the part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where in the world&mdash;?&rdquo; I gasped in astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the house of Mr. Nicholas Jones, in Eaton Terrace,&rdquo; she
    interrupted dryly, &ldquo;the one occupied until recently by his sister,
    the late Mrs. Dunstan. Mrs. Jones is advertising for a cook, and you must
    get that place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As you know, I have carried obedience to the level of a fine art. Nor was
    I altogether astonished that my dear lady had at last been asked to put one
    of her dainty fingers in that Dunstan pie, which was puzzling our fellows
    more completely than any other case I have ever known.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember the many circumstances, the various contradictions
    which were cropping up at every turn, and which baffled our ablest detectives
    at the very moment when they thought themselves most near the solution of
    that strange mystery.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan herself was a very uninteresting individual: self-righteous,
    self-conscious and fat, a perfect type of the moneyed middle-class woman
    whose balance at the local bank is invariably heavier than that of her neighbours.
    Her niece, Violet Frostwicke, lived with her: a smart, pretty girl, inordinately
    fond of dainty clothes and other luxuries which money can give. Being totally
    impecunious herself, she bore with the older woman&rsquo;s constantly varying
    caprices with almost angelic patience, a fact probably attributable to Mrs.
    Dunstan&rsquo;s testamentary intentions, which, as she often averred, were
    in favour of her niece.</p>
  <p>In addition to these two ladies, the household consisted of three servants
    and Miss Cruikshank. The latter was a quiet, unassuming girl who was by way
    of being secretary and lady-help to Mrs. Dunstan, but who, in reality, was
    nothing but a willing drudge. Up betimes in the morning, she combined the
    work of a housekeeper with that of an upper servant. She interviewed the
    tradespeople, kept the servants in order, and ironed and smartened up Miss
    Violet&rsquo;s blouses. A Cinderella, in fact.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan kept a cook and two maids, all of whom had been with her for
    years. In addition to these, a charwoman came very early in the morning to
    light fires, clean boots, and do the front steps.</p>
  <p>On November 22nd, 1907&mdash;for the early history of this curious drama
    dates back to that year&mdash;the charwoman who had been employed at Mrs.
    Dunstan&rsquo;s house in Eaton Terrace for some considerable time, sent word
    in the morning that in future she would be unable to come. Her husband had
    been obliged to move to lodgings nearer to his work, and she herself could
    not undertake to come the greater distance at the early hour at which Mrs.
    Dunstan required her.</p>
  <p>The woman had written a very nice letter explaining these facts, and sent
    it by hand, stating at the same time that the bearer of the note was a very
    respectable woman, a friend of her own, who would be very pleased to &ldquo;oblige&rdquo; Mrs.
    Dunstan by taking on the morning&rsquo;s work.</p>
  <p>I must tell you that the message and its bearer arrived at Eaton Terrace
    somewhere about 6.0 a.m., when no one was down except the Cinderella of the
    house, Miss Cruikshank.</p>
  <p>She saw the woman, liked her appearance, and there and then engaged her
    to do the work, subject to Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s approval.</p>
  <p>The woman, who had given her name as Mrs. Thomas, seemed very quiet and
    respectable. She said that she lived close by, in St. Peter&rsquo;s Mews,
    and therefore could come as early as Mrs. Dunstan wished. In fact, from that
    day, she came every morning at 5.30 a.m., and by seven o&rsquo;clock had
    finished her work, and was able to go home.</p>
  <p>If, in addition to these details, I tell you that, at that time, pretty
    Miss Violet Frostwicke was engaged to a young Scotsman, Mr. David Athol,
    of whom her aunt totally disapproved, I shall have put before you all the
    personages who, directly or indirectly, were connected with that drama, the
    final act of which has not yet been witnessed either by the police or by
    the public.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>On the following New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Mrs. Dunstan, as was her invariable
    custom on that day, went to her married brother&rsquo;s house to dine and
    to see the New Year in.</p>
  <p>During her absence the usual thing occurred at Eaton Terrace. Miss Violet
    Frostwicke took the opportunity of inviting Mr. David Athol to spend the
    evening with her.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s servants, mind you, all knew of the engagement between
    the young people, and with the characteristic sentimentality of their class,
    connived at these secret meetings and helped to hoodwink the irascible old
    aunt.</p>
  <p>Mr. Athol was a good-looking young man, whose chief demerit lay in his total
    lack of money or prospects. Also he was by way of being an actor, another
    deadly sin in the eyes of the puritanically-minded old lady.</p>
  <p>Already, on more than one occasion, there had been vigorous wordy warfare  &rsquo;twixt
    Mr. Athol and Mrs. Dunstan, and the latter had declared that if Violet chose
    to take up with this mountebank, she should never see a penny of her aunt&rsquo;s
    money now or in the future.</p>
  <p>The young man did not come very often to Eaton Terrace, but on this festive
    New Year&rsquo;s Eve, when Mrs. Dunstan was not expected to be home until
    long after midnight, it seemed too splendid an opportunity for an ardent
    lover to miss.</p>
  <p>As ill-luck would have it, Mrs. Dunstan had not felt very well after her
    copious dinner, and her brother, Mr. Nicholas Jones, escorted her home soon
    after ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>Jane, the parlour-maid who opened the front door, was, in her own graphic
    language, &ldquo;knocked all of a heap&rdquo; when she saw her mistress,
    knowing full well that Mr. Athol was still in the dining-room with Miss Violet,
    and that Miss Cruikshank was at that very moment busy getting him a whisky
    and soda.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the coat and hat in the hall had revealed the young man&rsquo;s
    presence in the house.</p>
  <p>For a moment Mrs. Dunstan paused, whilst Jane stood by trembling with fright.
    Then the old lady turned to Mr. Nicholas Jones, who was still standing on
    the doorstep, and said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you telephone over to Mr. Blenkinsop, Nick, the first thing
    in the morning, and tell him I&rsquo;ll be at his office by ten o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blenkinsop was Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s solicitor, and as Jane explained
    to the cook later on, what could such an appointment mean but a determination
    to cut Miss Violet out of the missis&rsquo;s will with the proverbial shilling?</p>
  <p>After this Mrs. Dunstan took leave of her brother and went straight into
    the dining-room.</p>
  <p>According to the subsequent testimony of all three servants, the mistress  &ldquo;went
    on dreadful.&rdquo; Words were not easily distinguishable from behind the
    closed door, but it seems that, immediately she entered, Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s
    voice was raised as if in terrible anger, and a few moments later Miss Violet
    fled crying from the dining-room, and ran quickly upstairs.</p>
  <p>Whilst the door was thus momentarily opened and shut, the voice of the old
    lady was heard saying, in majestic wrath:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you have done. Get out of this house. As for her,
    she&rsquo;ll never see a penny of my money, and she may starve for aught
    I care!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The quarrel seems to have continued for a short while after that, the servants
    being too deeply awed by those last vindictive words which they had heard
    to take much note of what went on subsequently.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan and Mr. Athol were closeted together for some time; but apparently
    the old lady&rsquo;s wrath did not subside, for when she marched up to bed
    an hour later she was heard to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out of this house she shall go, and the first thing in the morning,
    too. I&rsquo;ll have no goings-on with a mountebank like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Cruikshank was terribly upset.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a frightful blow for Miss Violet,&rdquo; she said to cook, &ldquo;but
    perhaps Mrs. Dunstan will feel more forgiving in the morning. I&rsquo;ll
    take her up a glass of champagne now. She is very fond of that, and it will
    help her to get to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Cruikshank went up with the champagne, and told cook to see Mr. Athol
    out of the house; but the young man, who seemed very anxious and agitated,
    would not go away immediately. He stayed in the dining-room, smoking, for
    a while, and when the two younger servants went up to bed, he asked cook
    to let him remain until he had seen Miss Violet once more, for he was sure
    she would come down again&mdash;he had asked Miss Cruikshank to beg her to
    do so.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Kennett, the cook, was a kind-hearted old woman. She had taken the
    young people under her special protection, and felt very vexed that the course
    of true love should not be allowed to run quite smoothly. So she told Mr.
    Athol to make himself happy and comfortable in the dining-room, and she would
    sit up by the fire in the library until he was ready to go.</p>
  <p>The good soul thereupon made up the fire in the library, drew a chair in
    front of it, and&mdash;went fast to sleep.</p>
  <p>Suddenly something awoke her. She sat up and looked round in that dazed
    manner peculiar to people just aroused from deep sleep.</p>
  <p>She looked at the clock; it was past three. Surely, she thought, it must
    have been Mr. Athol calling to her which had caused her to wake. She went
    into the hall, where the gas had not yet been turned off, and there she saw
    Miss Violet, fully dressed and wearing a hat and coat, in the very act of
    going out at the front door.</p>
  <p>In the cook&rsquo;s own words, before she could ask a question or even utter
    a sound, the young girl had opened the front door, which was still on the
    latch, and then banged it to again, she herself having disappeared into the
    darkness of the street beyond.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Kennett ran to the door and out into the street as fast as her old
    legs would let her; but the night was an exceptionally foggy one. Violet,
    no doubt, had walked rapidly away, and there came no answer to Mrs. Kennett&rsquo;s
    repeated calls.</p>
  <p>Thoroughly upset, and not knowing what to do, the good woman went back into
    the house. Mr. Athol had evidently left, for there was no sign of him in
    the dining-room or elsewhere. She then went upstairs and knocked at Mrs.
    Dunstan&rsquo;s door. To her astonishment the gas was still burning in her
    mistress&rsquo;s room, as she could see a thin ray of light filtering through
    the keyhole. At her first knock there came a quick, impatient answer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Violet, &rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the cook, who was too agitated
    to speak very coherently, &ldquo;she is gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The best thing she could do,&rdquo; came promptly from the other
    side of the door. &ldquo;You go to bed, Mrs. Kennett, and don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon the gas was suddenly turned off inside the room, and, in spite
    of Mrs. Kennett&rsquo;s further feeble protests, no other word issued from
    the room save another impatient:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cook then did as she was bid; but before going to bed she made the round
    of the house, turned off all the gas, and finally bolted the front door.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Some three hours later the servants were called, as usual, by Miss Cruikshank,
    who then went down to open the area door to Mrs. Thomas, the charwoman.</p>
  <p>At half-past six, when Mary the housemaid came down, candle in hand, she
    saw the charwoman a flight or two lower down, also apparently in the act
    of going downstairs. This astonished Mary not a little, as the woman&rsquo;s
    work lay entirely in the basement, and she was supposed never to come to
    the upper floors.</p>
  <p>The woman, though walking rapidly down the stairs, seemed, moreover, to
    be carrying something heavy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything wrong, Mrs. Thomas?&rdquo; asked Mary, in a whisper.</p>
  <p>The woman looked up, pausing a moment immediately under the gas bracket,
    the by-pass of which shed a feeble light upon her and upon her burden. The
    latter Mary recognised as the bag containing the sand which, on frosty mornings,
    had to be strewn on the front steps of the house.</p>
  <p>On the whole, though she certainly was puzzled, Mary did not think very
    much about the incident then. As was her custom, she went into the housemaid&rsquo;s
    closet, got the hot water for Miss Cruikshank&rsquo;s bath, and carried it
    to the latter&rsquo;s room, where she also pulled up the blinds and got things
    ready generally. For Miss Cruikshank usually ran down in her dressing-gown,
    and came up to tidy herself later on.</p>
  <p>As a rule, by the time the three servants got downstairs, it was nearly
    seven, and Mrs. Thomas had generally gone by that time; but on this occasion
    Mary was earlier. Miss Cruikshank was busy in the kitchen getting Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s
    tea ready. Mary spoke about seeing Mrs. Thomas on the stairs with the bag
    of sand, and Miss Cruikshank, too, was very astonished at the occurrence.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Kennett was not yet down, and the charwoman apparently had gone; her
    work had been done as usual, and the sand was strewn over the stone steps
    in front, as the frosty fog had rendered them very slippery.</p>
  <p>At a quarter past seven Miss Cruikshank went up with Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s
    tea, and less than two minutes later a fearful scream rang through the entire
    house, followed by the noise of breaking crockery.</p>
  <p>In an instant the two maids ran upstairs, straight to Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s
    room, the door of which stood wide open.</p>
  <p>The first thing Mary and Jane were conscious of was a terrific smell of
    gas, then of Miss Cruikshank, with eyes dilated with horror, staring at the
    bed in front of her, whereon lay Mrs. Dunstan, with one end of a piece of
    indiarubber piping still resting in her mouth, her jaw having dropped in
    death. The other end of that piece of piping was attached to the burner of
    a gas-bracket on the wall close by.</p>
  <p>Every window in the room was fastened and the curtains drawn. The whole
    room reeked of gas.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan had been asphyxiated by its fumes.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>A year went by after the discovery of the mysterious tragedy, and I can
    assure you that our fellows at the Yard had one of the toughest jobs in connection
    with the case that ever fell to their lot. Just think of all the contradictions
    which met them at every turn.</p>
  <p>Firstly, the disappearance of Miss Violet.</p>
  <p>No sooner had the women in the Dunstan household roused themselves sufficiently
    from their horror at the terrible discovery which they had just made, than
    they were confronted with another almost equally awful fact&mdash;awful,
    of course, because of its connection with the primary tragedy.</p>
  <p>Miss Violet Frostwicke had gone. Her room was empty, her bed had not been
    slept in. She herself had been seen by the cook, Mrs. Kennett, stealing out
    of the house at dead of night.</p>
  <p>To connect the pretty, dainty young girl even remotely with a crime so hideous,
    so callous, as the deliberate murder of an old woman, who had been as a mother
    to her, seemed absolutely out of the question, and by tacit consent the four
    women, who now remained in the desolate and gloom-laden house at Eaton Terrace,
    forbore to mention Miss Violet Frostiwicke&rsquo;s name either to police
    or doctor.</p>
  <p>Both these, of course, had been summoned immediately; Miss Cruikshank sending
    Mary to the police-station and thence to Dr. Folwell, in Eaton Square, whilst
    Jane went off in a cab to fetch Mr. Nicholas Jones, who, fortunately, had
    not yet left for his place of business.</p>
  <p>The doctor&rsquo;s and the police-inspector&rsquo;s first thought, on examining
    the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the terrible tragedy, was that Mrs. Dunstan
    had committed suicide. It was practically impossible to imagine that a woman
    in full possession of health and strength would allow a piece of indiarubber
    piping to be fixed between her teeth, and would, without a struggle, continue
    to inhale the poisonous fumes which would mean certain death. Yet there were
    no marks of injury upon the body, nothing to show how sufficient unconsciousness
    had been produced in the victim to permit of the miscreant completing his
    awesome deed.</p>
  <p>But the theory of suicide set up by Dr. Folwell was promptly refuted by
    the most cursory examination of the room.</p>
  <p>Though the drawers were found closed, they had obviously been turned over,
    as if the murderer had been in search either of money or papers, or the key
    of the safe.</p>
  <p>The latter, on investigation, was found to be open, whilst the key lay on
    the floor close by. A brief examination of the safe revealed the fact that
    the tin boxes must have been ransacked, for they contained neither money
    nor important papers now, whilst the gold and platinum settings of necklaces,
    bracelets, and a tiara showed that the stones&mdash;which, as Mr. Nicholas
    Jones subsequently averred, were of considerable value&mdash;had been carefully,
    if somewhat clumsily, taken out by obvious inexperienced hands.</p>
  <p>On the whole, therefore, appearances suggested deliberate, systematic, and
    very leisurely robbery, which wholly contradicted the theory of suicide.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly the name of Miss Frostwicke was mentioned. Who first brought
    it on the <i>tapis</i> no one subsequently could say; but in a moment the
    whole story of the young girl&rsquo;s engagement to Mr. Athol, in defiance
    of her aunt&rsquo;s wishes, the quarrel of the night before, and the final
    disappearance of both young people from the house during the small hours
    of the morning, was dragged from the four unwilling witnesses by the able
    police-inspector.</p>
  <p>Nay, more. One very unpleasant little circumstance was detailed by one of
    the maids and corroborated by Miss Cruikshank.</p>
  <p>It seems that when the latter took up the champagne to Mrs. Dunstan, the
    old lady desired Miss Violet to come to her room. Mary, the housemaid, was
    on the stairs when she saw the young girl, still dressed in her evening gown
    of white chiffon, her eyes still swollen with tears, knocking at her aunt&rsquo;s
    door.</p>
  <p>The police-inspector was busy taking notes, already building up in his mind
    a simple, if very sensational, case against Violet Frostwicke, when Mrs.
    Kennett promptly upset all his calculations.</p>
  <p>Miss Violet could have had nothing to do with the murder of her aunt, seeing
    that Mrs. Dunstan was alive and actually spoke to the cook when the latter
    knocked at her bedroom door after she had seen the young girl walk out of
    the house.</p>
  <p>Then came the question of Mr. Athol. But, if you remember, it was quite
    impossible even to begin to build up a case against the young man. His own
    statement that he left the house at about midnight, having totally forgotten
    to rouse the cook when he did so, was amply corroborated from every side.</p>
  <p>The cabman who took him up to the corner of Eaton Terrace at 11.50 p.m.
    was one witness in his favour; his landlady at his rooms in Jermyn Street,
    who let him in, since he had mislaid his latchkey, and who took him up some
    tea at seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning, was another; whilst, when Mary
    saw Miss Violet going into her aunt&rsquo;s room, the clock at St. Peter&rsquo;s,
    Eaton Square, was just striking twelve.</p>
  <p>I dare say you think I ought by now to have mentioned the charwoman, Mrs.
    Thomas, who represented the final, most complete, most hopeless contradiction
    in this remarkable case.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thomas was seen by Mary, the housemaid, at half-past six o&rsquo;clock
    in the morning, coming down from the upper floors, where she had no business
    to be, and carrying the bag of sand used for strewing over the slippery front-door
    steps.</p>
  <p>The bag of sand, of course, was always kept in the area.</p>
  <p>The moment that bag of sand was mentioned Dr. Folwell gave a curious gasp.
    Here, at least, was the solution to one mystery. The victim had been stunned
    whilst still in bed by a blow on the head dealt with that bag of sand; and
    whilst she was unconscious the callous miscreant had robbed her and finally
    asphyxiated her with the gas fumes.</p>
  <p>Where was the woman who, at half-past six in the morning, was seen in possession
    of the silent instrument of death?</p>
  <p>Mrs. Thomas had disappeared. The last that was then or ever has been seen
    of her was when she passed underneath the dim light of a by-pass on the landing,
    as if tired out with the weight which she was carrying.</p>
  <p>Since then, as you know, the police have been unswerving in their efforts
    to find Mrs. Thomas. The address which she had given in St. Peter&rsquo;s
    Mews was found to be false. No one of that name or appearance had ever been
    seen there.</p>
  <p>The woman who was supposed to have sent her with a letter of recommendation
    to Mrs. Dunstan knew nothing of her. She swore that she had never sent anyone
    with a letter to Mrs. Dunstan. She gave up her work there one day because
    she found it too hard at such an early hour in the morning; but she never
    heard anything more from her late employer after that.</p>
  <p>Strange, wasn&rsquo;t it, that two people should have disappeared out of
    that house on that same memorable night?</p>
  <p>Of course, you will remember the tremendous sensation that was caused some
    twenty-four hours later, when it transpired that the young person who had
    thrown herself into the river from Waterloo Bridge on that same eventful
    morning, and whose body was subsequently recovered and conveyed to the Thames
    Police station, was identified as Miss Violet Frostwicke, the niece of the
    lady who had been murdered in her own house in Eaton Terrace.</p>
  <p>Neither money nor diamonds were found on poor Miss Violet. She had herself
    given the most complete proof that she, at least, had no hand in robbing
    or killing Mrs. Dunstan.</p>
  <p>The public wondered why she took her aunt&rsquo;s wrath and her probable
    disinheritance so fearfully to heart, and sympathised with Mr. David Athol
    for the terribly sad loss which he had sustained.</p>
  <p>But Mrs. Thomas, the charwoman, had not yet been found.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>I think I looked an extremely respectable, good plain cook when I presented
    myself at the house in Eaton Terrace in response to the advertisement in
    the &ldquo;Daily Telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As, in addition to my prepossessing appearance, I also asked very low wages
    and declared myself ready to do anything except scour the front steps and
    the stone area, I was immediately engaged by Mrs. Jones, and was duly installed
    in the house the following day under the name of Mrs. Curwen.</p>
  <p>But few events had occurred here since the discovery of the dual tragedy,
    now more than a year ago, and none that had thrown any light upon the mystery
    which surrounded it.</p>
  <p>The verdict at the inquest had been one of wilful murder against a person
    known as Mrs. Thomas, the weight of evidence, coupled with her disappearance,
    having been very heavy against her; and there was a warrant out for her arrest.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Dunstan had died intestate. To the astonishment of all those in the
    know, she had never signed the will which Messrs. Blenkinsop and Blenkinsop
    had drafted for her, and wherein she bequeathed &pound;20,000 and the lease
    of her house in Eaton Terrace to her beloved niece, Violet Frostwicke, &pound;1,000
    to Miss Cruikshank, and other, smaller, legacies to friends or servants.</p>
  <p>In default of a will, Mr. Nicholas Jones, only brother of the deceased,
    became possessed of all her wealth.</p>
  <p>He was a very rich man himself, and many people thought that he ought to
    give Miss Cruikshank the &pound;1,000 which the poor girl had thus lost through
    no fault of her own.</p>
  <p>What his ultimate intentions were with regard to this no one could know.
    For the present he contented himself with moving to Eaton Terrace with his
    family; and, as his wife was a great invalid, he asked Miss Cruikshank to
    continue to make her home in the house and to help in its management.</p>
  <p>Neither the diamonds nor the money stolen from Mrs. Dunstan&rsquo;s safe
    were ever traced. It seems that Mrs. Dunstan, a day or two before her death,
    had sold a freehold cottage which she owned near Teddington. The money, as
    is customary, had been handed over to her in gold, in Mr. Blenkinsop&rsquo;s
    office, and she had been foolish enough not to bank it immediately. This
    money and the diamonds had been the chief spoils of her assailant. And all
    the while no trace of Mrs. Thomas, in spite of the most strenuous efforts
    on the part of the police to find. her.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, when I had been in Eaton Terrace about three days, and
    was already getting very tired of early rising and hard work, the charwoman
    there fell ill one day and did not come to her work as usual.</p>
  <p>I, of course, grumbled like six, for I had to be on my hands and knees the
    next morning scrubbing stone steps, and my thoughts of Lady Molly, for the
    moment, were not quite as loyal as they usually were.</p>
  <p>Suddenly I heard a shuffling footstep close behind me. I turned and saw
    a rough-looking, ill-dressed woman standing at the bottom of the steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; I asked sourly, for I was in a very bad
    humour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw you scrubbing them steps, miss,&rdquo; she replied in a raucous
    voice;  &ldquo;my &rsquo;usband is out of work, and the children hain&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad
    no breakfast this morning. I&rsquo;d do them steps, miss, if you&rsquo;d
    give me a trifle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman certainly did not look very prepossessing, with her shabby, broad-brimmed
    hat hiding the upper part of her face, and her skirt, torn and muddy, pinned
    up untidily round her stooping figure.</p>
  <p>However, I did not think that I could be doing anything very wrong by letting
    her do this one bit of rough work, which I hated, so I agreed to give her
    sixpence, and left her there with kneeling mat and scrubbing-brush, and went
    in, leaving, however, the front door open.</p>
  <p>In the hall I met Miss Cruikshank, who, as usual, was down before everybody
    else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Curwen?&rdquo; she asked, for through the open door she
    had caught sight of the woman kneeling on the step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A woman, miss,&rdquo; I replied, somewhat curtly. &ldquo;She offered
    to do the steps. I thought Mrs. Jones wouldn&rsquo;t mind, as Mrs. Callaghan
    hasn&rsquo;t turned up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Cruikshank hesitated an instant, and then walked up to the front door.</p>
  <p>At the same moment the woman looked up, rose from her knees, and boldly
    went up to accost Miss Cruikshank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember me, miss,&rdquo; she said, in her raucous voice. &ldquo;I
    used to work for Mrs. Dunstan once. My name is Mrs. Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No wonder Miss Cruikshank uttered a quickly smothered cry of horror. Thinking
    that she would faint, I ran to her assistance; but she waved me aside and
    then said quite quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This poor woman&rsquo;s mind is deranged. She is no more Mrs. Thomas
    than I am. Perhaps we had better send for the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said the
    woman with a sigh. &ldquo;My secret has been weighin&rsquo; heavy on me of
    late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my good woman,&rdquo; said Miss Cruikshank, very kindly, for
    I suppose that she thought, as I did, that this was one of those singular
    cases of madness which sometimes cause innocent people to accuse themselves
    of undiscovered crimes.  &ldquo;You are not Mrs. Thomas at all. I knew Mrs.
    Thomas well, of course&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you knew me, miss,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;The
    last conversation you and I had together was in the kitchen that morning,
    when Mrs. Dunstan was killed. I remember your saying to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fetch the police, Curwen,&rdquo; said Miss Cruikshank, peremptorily.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the woman broke into a harsh and loud laugh of defiance.</p>
  <p>To tell you the truth, I was not a little puzzled. That this scene had been
    foreseen by my dear lady, and that she had sent me to this house on purpose
    that I should witness it, I was absolutely convinced. But&mdash;here was
    my dilemma: ought I to warn the police at once or not?</p>
  <p>On the whole, I decided that my best plan would undoubtedly be to communicate
    with Lady Molly first of all, and to await her instructions. So I ran upstairs,
    scribbled a hasty note to my dear lady, and, in response to Miss Cruikshank&rsquo;s
    orders, flew out of the house through the area gate, noticing, as I did so,
    that Miss Cruikshank was still parleying with the woman on the doorstep.</p>
  <p>I sent the note off to Maida Vale by taxicab; then I went back to Eaton
    Terrace. Miss Cruikshank met me at the front door, and told me that she had
    tried to detain the woman, pending my return; but that she felt very sorry
    for the unfortunate creature, who obviously was labouring under a delusion,
    and she had allowed her to go away.</p>
  <p>About an hour later I received a curt note from Lady Molly ordering me to
    do nothing whatever without her special authorisation.</p>
  <p>In the course of the day, Miss Cruikshank told me that she had been to the
    police-station, and had consulted with the inspector, who said there would
    be no harm in engaging the pseudo Mrs. Thomas to work at Eaton Terrace, especially
    as thus she would remain under observation.</p>
  <p>Then followed a curious era in Mr. Nicholas Jones&rsquo;s otherwise well-ordered
    household. We three servants, instead of being called at six as heretofore,
    were allowed to sleep on until seven. When we came down we were not scolded.
    On the contrary, we found our work already done.</p>
  <p>The charwoman&mdash;whoever she was&mdash;must have been a very hard-working
    woman. It was marvellous what she accomplished single-handed before seven
    a.m., by which time she had invariably gone.</p>
  <p>The two maids, of course, were content to let this pleasant state of things
    go on, but I was devoured with curiosity.</p>
  <p>One morning I crept quietly downstairs and went into the kitchen soon after
    six. I found the pseudo Mrs. Thomas sitting at a very copious breakfast.
    I noticed that she had on altogether different&mdash;though equally shabby
    and dirty&mdash;clothes from those she had worn when she first appeared on
    the doorstep of 180, Eaton Terrace. Near her plate were three or four golden
    sovereigns over which she had thrown her grimy hand.</p>
  <p>Miss Cruikshank the while was on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor.
    At sight of me she jumped up, and with obvious confusion muttered something
    about &ldquo;hating to be idle,&rdquo; etc.</p>
  <p>That day Miss Cruikshank told me that I did not suit Mrs. Jones, who wished
    me to leave at the end of my month. In the afternoon I received a little
    note from my dear lady, telling me to be downstairs by six o&rsquo;clock
    the following morning.</p>
  <p>I did as I was ordered, of course, and when I came into the kitchen punctually
    at six a.m. I found the charwoman sitting at the table with a pile of gold
    in front of her, which she was counting over with a very grubby finger. She
    had her back to me, and was saying as I entered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think if you was to give me another fifty quid I&rsquo;d leave
    you the rest now. You&rsquo;d still have the diamonds and the rest of the
    money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke to Miss Cruikshank, who was facing me, and who, on seeing me appear,
    turned as white as a ghost. But she quickly recovered herself, and, standing
    between me and the woman, she said vehemently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by prying on me like this? Go and pack your boxes
    and leave the house this instant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page224.jpg" width="548" height="750"></p>
  <p>But before I could reply the woman had interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself, miss,&rdquo; she said, placing her
    grimy hand on Miss Cruikshank&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
    bag of sand in that there corner; we&rsquo;ll knock &rsquo;er down as we
    did Mrs. Dunstan&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you lying fool!&rdquo; said the girl, who now looked
    like a maddened fury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me that other fifty quid and I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue,&rdquo; retorted
    the woman, boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This creature is mad,&rdquo; said Miss Cruikshank, who had made a
    vigorous and successful effort to recover herself. &ldquo;She is under the
    delusion that not only is she Mrs. Thomas, but that she murdered Mrs. Dunstan&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; interrupted the woman. &ldquo;I only came back
    that morning because I recollected that you had left the bag of sand upstairs
    after you so cleverly did away with Mrs. Dunstan, robbed her of all her money
    and jewels, and even were sharp enough to imitate her voice when Mrs. Kennett,
    the cook, terrified you by speaking to Mrs. Dunstan through the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false! You are not Mrs. Thomas. The two maids who are here
    now, and who were in this house at the time, can swear that you are a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us change clothes now, Miss Cruikshank,&rdquo; said a voice,
    which sounded almost weirdly in my ear in spite of its familiarity, for I
    could not locate whence it came, &ldquo;and see if in a charwoman&rsquo;s
    dress those two maids would not recognise <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; continued the same familiar voice, &ldquo;help me out
    of these filthy clothes. Perhaps Miss Cruikshank would like to resume her
    own part of Mrs. Thomas, the charwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liars and impostors&mdash;both!&rdquo; shouted the girl, who was
    rapidly losing all presence of mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite unnecessary,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly coolly; &ldquo;Detective-Inspector
    Danvers is just outside that door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl made a dash for the other door, but I was too quick for her, and
    held her back, even whilst Lady Molly gave a short, sharp call which brought
    Danvers on the scene.</p>
  <p>I must say that Miss Cruikshank made a bold fight, but Danvers had two of
    our fellows with him, and arrested her on the warrant for the apprehension
    of the person known as Mrs. Thomas.</p>
  <p>The clothes of the charwoman who had so mysteriously disappeared had been
    found by Lady Molly at the back of the coal cellar, and she was still dressed
    in them at the present moment.</p>
  <p>No wonder I had not recognised my own dainty lady in the grimy woman who
    had so successfully played the part of a blackmailer on the murderess of
    Mrs. Dunstan. She explained to me subsequently that the first inkling that
    she had had of the horrible truth&mdash;namely, that it was Miss Cruikshank
    who had deliberately planned to murder Mrs. Dunstan by impersonating a charwoman
    for a while, and thus throwing dust in the eyes of the police&mdash;was when
    she heard of the callous words which the old lady was supposed to have uttered
    when she was told of Miss Violet&rsquo;s flight from the house in the middle
    of the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She may have been very angry at the girl&rsquo;s escapade,&rdquo; explained
    Lady Molly to me, &ldquo;but she would not have allowed her to starve. Such
    cruelty was out of all proportion to the offence. Then I looked about me
    for a stronger motive for the old lady&rsquo;s wrath; and, remembering what
    she said on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, when Violet fled crying from the room,
    I came to the conclusion that her anger was not directed against her niece,
    but against the other girl, and against the man who had transferred his affections
    from Violet Frostwicke to Miss Cruikshank, and had not only irritated Mrs.
    Dunstan by this clandestine, double-faced love-making, but had broken the
    heart of his trusting <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt Miss Cruikshank did not know that the will, whereby she
    was to inherit &pound;1,000, was not signed, and no doubt she and young Athol
    planned out that cruel murder between them. The charwoman was also a bag
    of sand which was literally thrown in the eyes of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how a cold-blooded
    creature like that Miss Cruikshank could have allowed herself to be terrorised
    and blackmailed. She knew that you could not be Mrs. Thomas, since Mrs. Thomas
    never existed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but one must reckon a little sometimes with that negligible
    quantity known as conscience. My appearance as Mrs. Thomas vaguely frightened
    Miss Cruikshank. She wondered who I was and what I knew. When, three days
    later, I found the shabby clothes in the coal-cellar and appeared dressed
    in them, she lost her head. She gave me money! From that moment she was done
    for. Confession was only a matter of time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Miss Cruikshank did make full confession. She was recommended to mercy
    on account of her sex, but she was plucky enough not to implicate David Athol
    in the recital of her crime.</p>
  <p>He has since emigrated to Western Canada.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheManInTheInvernessCape"></a>The Man In The Inverness Cape</b></h2>
  <p>I have heard many people say&mdash;people, too, mind you, who read their
    daily paper regularly&mdash;that it is quite impossible for anyone to &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; within
    the confines of the British Isles. At the same time these wise people invariably
    admit one great exception to their otherwise unimpeachable theory, and that
    is the case of Mr. Leonard Marvell, who, as you know, walked out one afternoon
    from the Scotia Hotel in Cromwell Road and has never been seen or heard of
    since.</p>
  <p>Information had originally been given to the police by Mr. Marvell&rsquo;s
    sister Olive, a Scotchwoman of the usually accepted type: tall, bony, with
    sandy-coloured hair, and a somewhat melancholy expression in her blue-grey
    eyes.</p>
  <p>Her brother, she said, had gone out on a rather foggy afternoon. I think
    it was the 3rd of February, just about a year ago. His intention had been
    to go and consult a solicitor in the City&mdash;whose address had been given
    him recently by a friend&mdash;about some private business of his own.</p>
  <p>Mr. Marvell had told his sister that he would get a train at South Kensington
    Station to Moorgate Street, and walk thence to Finsbury Square. She was to
    expect him home by dinner-time.</p>
  <p>As he was, however, very irregular in his habits, being fond of spending
    his evenings at restaurants and music-halls, the sister did not feel the
    least anxious when he did not return home at the appointed time. She had
    her dinner in the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> room, and went to bed soon
    after 10.0.</p>
  <p>She and her brother occupied two bedrooms and a sitting-room on the second
    floor of the little private hotel. Miss Marvell, moreover, had a maid always
    with her, as she was somewhat of an invalid. This girl, Rosie Campbell, a
    nice-looking Scotch lassie, slept on the top floor.</p>
  <p>It was only on the following morning, when Mr. Leonard did not put in an
    appearance at breakfast, that Miss Marvell began to feel anxious. According
    to her own account, she sent Rosie in to see if anything was the matter,
    and the girl, wide-eyed and not a little frightened, came back with the news
    that Mr. Marvell was not in his room, and that his bed had not been slept
    in that night.</p>
  <p>With characteristic Scottish reserve, Miss Olive said nothing about the
    matter at the time to anyone, nor did she give information to the police
    until two days later, when she herself had exhausted every means in her power
    to discover her brother&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
  <p>She had seen the lawyer to whose office Leonard Marvell had intended going
    that afternoon, but Mr. Statham, the solicitor in question, had seen nothing
    of the missing man.</p>
  <p>With great adroitness Rosie, the maid, had made inquiries at South Kensington
    and Moorgate Street stations. At the former, the booking clerk, who knew
    Mr. Marvell by sight, distinctly remembered selling him a first-class ticket
    to one of the City stations in the early part of the afternoon; but at Moorgate
    Street, which is a very busy station, no one recollected seeing a tall, red-haired
    Scotchman in an Inverness cape&mdash;such was the description given of the
    missing man. By that time the fog had become very thick in the City; traffic
    was disorganised, and everyone felt fussy, ill-tempered, and self-centred.</p>
  <p>These, in substance, were the details which Miss Marvell gave to the police
    on the subject of her brother&rsquo;s strange disappearance.</p>
  <p>At first she did not appear very anxious; she seemed to have great faith
    in Mr. Marvell&rsquo;s power to look after himself; moreover, she declared
    positively that her brother had neither valuables nor money about his person
    when he went out that afternoon.</p>
  <p>But as day succeeded day and no trace of the missing man had yet been found,
    matters became more serious, and the search instituted by our fellows at
    the Yard waxed more keen.</p>
  <p>A description of Mr. Leonard Marvell was published in the leading London
    and provincial dailies. Unfortunately, there was no good photograph of him
    extant, and descriptions are apt to prove vague.</p>
  <p>Very little was known about the man beyond his disappearance, which had
    rendered him famous. He and his sister had arrived at the Scotia Hotel about
    a month previously, and subsequently they were joined by the maid Campbell.</p>
  <p>Scotch people are far too reserved ever to speak of themselves or their
    affairs to strangers. Brother and sister spoke very little to anyone at the
    hotel. They had their meals in their sitting-room, waited on by the maid,
    who messed with the staff. But, in face of the present terrible calamity,
    Miss Marvell&rsquo;s frigidity relaxed before the police inspector, to whom
    she gave what information she could about her brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was like a son to me,&rdquo; she explained with scarcely restrained
    tears,  &ldquo;for we lost our parents early in life, and as we were left
    very, very badly off, our relations took but little notice of us. My brother
    was years younger than I am&mdash;and though he was a little wild and fond
    of pleasure, he was as good as gold to me, and has supported us both for
    years by journalistic work. We came to London from Glasgow about a month
    ago, because Leonard got a very good appointment on the staff of the &lsquo;Daily
    Post.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this, of course, was soon proved to be true; and although, on minute
    inquiries being instituted in Glasgow, but little seemed to be known about
    Mr. Leonard Marvell in that city, there seemed no doubt that he had done
    some reporting for the &ldquo;Courier,&rdquo; and that latterly, in response
    to an advertisement, he had applied for and obtained regular employment on
    the &ldquo;Daily Post.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The latter enterprising halfpenny journal, with characteristic magnanimity,
    made an offer of &pound;50 reward to any of its subscribers who gave information
    which would lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of Mr. Leonard Marvell.</p>
  <p>But time went by, and that &pound;50 remained unclaimed.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Lady Molly had not seemed as interested as she usually was in cases of this
    sort. With strange flippancy&mdash;wholly unlike herself&mdash;she remarked
    that one Scotch journalist more or less in London did not vastly matter.</p>
  <p>I was much amused, therefore, one morning about three weeks after the mysterious
    disappearance of Mr. Leonard Marvell, when Jane, our little parlour-maid,
    brought in a card accompanied by a letter.</p>
  <p>The card bore the name &ldquo;Miss Olive Marvell.&rdquo; The letter was
    the usual formula from the chief, asking Lady Molly to have a talk with the
    lady in question, and to come and see him on the subject after the interview.</p>
  <p>With a smothered yawn my dear lady told Jane to show in Miss Marvell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are two of them, my lady,&rdquo; said Jane, as she prepared
    to obey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two what?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly with a laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two ladies, I mean,&rdquo; explained Jane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! Show them both into the drawing-room,&rdquo; said Lady Molly,
    impatiently.</p>
  <p>Then, as Jane went off on this errand, a very funny thing happened; funny,
    because during the entire course of my intimate association with my dear
    lady, I had never known her act with such marked indifference in the face
    of an obviously interesting case. She turned to me and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, you had better see these two women, whoever they may be; I
    feel that they would bore me to distraction. Take note of what they say,
    and let me know. Now, don&rsquo;t argue,&rdquo; she added with a laugh, which
    peremptorily put a stop to my rising protest, &ldquo;but go and interview
    Miss Marvell and Co.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Needless to say, I promptly did as I was told, and the next few seconds
    saw me installed in our little drawing-room, saying polite preliminaries
    to the two ladies who sat opposite to me.</p>
  <p>I had no need to ask which of them was Miss Marvell. Tall, ill-dressed in
    deep black, with a heavy crape veil over her face, and black cotton gloves,
    she looked the uncompromising Scotchwoman to the life. In strange contrast
    to her depressing appearance, there sat beside her an over-dressed, much
    behatted, peroxided young woman, who bore the stamp of <i>the</i> profession
    all over her pretty, painted face.</p>
  <p>Miss Marvell, I was glad to note, was not long in plunging into the subject
    which had brought her here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw a gentleman at Scotland Yard,&rdquo; she explained, after a
    short preamble, &ldquo;because Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lulu Fay came to me at
    the hotel this very morning with a story which, in my opinion, should have
    been told to the police directly my brother&rsquo;s disappearance became
    known, and not three weeks later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The emphasis which she laid on the last few words and the stern look with
    which she regarded the golden-haired young woman beside her, showed the disapproval
    with which the rigid Scotchwoman viewed any connection which her brother
    might have had with the lady, whose very name seemed unpleasant to her lips.</p>
  <p>Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lulu Fay blushed even through her rouge, and turned
    a pair of large, liquid eyes imploringly upon me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know. I was frightened,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion to be frightened now,&rdquo; retorted Miss
    Marvell,  &ldquo;and the sooner you try and be truthful about the whole matter,
    the better it will be for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the stern woman&rsquo;s lips closed with a snap, as she deliberately
    turned her back on Miss Fay and began turning over the leaves of a magazine
    which happened to be on a table close to her hand.</p>
  <p>I muttered a few words of encouragement, for the little actress looked ready
    to cry. I spoke as kindly as I could, telling her that if indeed she could
    throw some light on Mr. Marvell&rsquo;s present whereabouts it was her duty
    to be quite frank on the subject.</p>
  <p>She &ldquo;hem&rdquo;-ed and &ldquo;ha&rdquo;-ed for awhile, and her simpering
    ways were just beginning to tell on my nerves, when she suddenly started
    talking very fast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am principal boy at the Grand,&rdquo; she explained with great
    volubility;  &ldquo;and I knew Mr. Leonard Marvell well&mdash;in fact&mdash;er&mdash;he
    paid me a good deal of attention and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and&mdash;?&rdquo; I queried, for the girl was obviously
    nervous.</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Miss Fay began to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it seems that my brother took this young&mdash;er&mdash;lady
    to supper on the night of February 3rd, after which no one has ever seen
    or heard of him again,&rdquo;  here interposed Miss Marvell, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>Lulu Fay nodded, whilst heavy tears fell upon her clasped hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why did you not tell this to the police three weeks ago?&rdquo; I
    ejaculated, with all the sternness at my command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was frightened,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frightened? Of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am engaged to Lord Mountnewte and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you did not wish him to know that you were accepting the attentions
    of Mr. Leonard Marvell&mdash;was that it? Well,&rdquo; I added, with involuntary
    impatience,  &ldquo;what happened after you had supper with Mr. Marvell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope&mdash;I hope that nothing happened,&rdquo; she said through
    more tears;  &ldquo;we had supper at the Trocadero, and he saw me into my
    brougham. Suddenly, just as I was driving away, I saw Lord Mountnewte standing
    quite close to us in the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did the two men know one another?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Miss Fay; &ldquo;at least, I didn&rsquo;t think
    so, but when I looked back through the window of my carriage I saw them standing
    on the kerb talking to each other for a moment, and then walk off together
    towards Piccadilly Circus. That is the last I have seen of either of them,&rdquo; continued
    the little actress with a fresh flood of tears. &ldquo;Lord Mountnewte hasn&rsquo;t
    spoken to me since, and Mr. Marvell has disappeared with my money and my
    diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your money and your diamonds?&rdquo; I gasped in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; he told me he was a jeweller, and that my diamonds wanted re-setting.
    He took them with him that evening, for he said that London jewellers were
    clumsy thieves, and that he would love to do the work for me himself. I also
    gave him two hundred pounds, which he said he would want for buying the gold
    and platinum required for the settings. And now he has disappeared&mdash;and
    my diamonds&mdash;and my money! Oh! I have been very&mdash;very foolish&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke down completely. Of course, one often hears of the idiocy
    of girls giving money and jewels unquestioningly to clever adventurers who
    know how to trade upon their inordinate vanity. There was, therefore, nothing
    very out of the way in the story just told me by Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lulu
    Fay, until the moment when Miss Marvell&rsquo;s quiet voice, with its marked
    Scotch burr, broke in upon the short silence which had followed the actress&rsquo;s
    narrative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I explained to the chief detective-inspector at Scotland Yard,&rdquo;  she
    said calmly, &ldquo;the story which this young&mdash;er&mdash;lady tells
    is only partly true. She may have had supper with Mr. Leonard Marvell on
    the night of February 3rd, and he may have paid her certain attentions; but
    he never deceived her by telling her that he was a jeweller, nor did he obtain
    possession of her diamonds and her money through false statements. My brother
    was the soul of honour and loyalty. If for some reason which Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lulu
    Fay chooses to keep secret, he had her jewels and money in his possession
    on the fatal February 3rd, then I think his disappearance is accounted for.
    He has been robbed and perhaps murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like a true Scotchwoman she did not give way to tears, but even her harsh
    voice trembled slightly when she thus bore witness to her brother&rsquo;s
    honesty, and expressed the fears which assailed her as to his fate.</p>
  <p>Imagine my plight! I could ill forgive my dear lady for leaving me in this
    unpleasant position&mdash;a sort of peacemaker between two women who evidently
    hated one another, and each of whom was trying her best to give the other &ldquo;the
    lie direct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I ventured to ring for our faithful Jane and to send her with an imploring
    message to Lady Molly, begging her to come and disentangle the threads of
    this muddled skein with her clever fingers; but Jane returned with a curt
    note from my dear lady, telling me not to worry about such a silly case,
    and to bow the two women out of the flat as soon as possible and then come
    for a nice walk.</p>
  <p>I wore my official manner as well as I could, trying not to betray the &rsquo;prentice
    hand. Of course, the interview lasted a great deal longer, and there was
    considerably more talk than I can tell you of in a brief narrative. But the
    gist of it all was just as I have said. Miss Lulu Fay stuck to every point
    of the story which she had originally told Miss Marvell. It was the latter
    uncompromising lady who had immediately marched the younger woman off to
    Scotland Yard in order that she might repeat her tale to the police. I did
    not wonder that the chief promptly referred them both to Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>Anyway, I made excellent shorthand notes of the conflicting stories which
    I heard; and I finally saw, with real relief, the two women walk out of our
    little front door.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lulu Fay, mind you, never contradicted in any one particular
    the original story which she had told me, about going out to supper with
    Leonard Marvell, entrusting him with &pound;200 and the diamonds, which he
    said he would have reset for her, and seeing him finally in close conversation
    with her recognised <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, Lord Mountnewte. Miss Marvell,
    on the other hand, very commendably refused to admit that her brother acted
    dishonestly towards the girl. If he had her jewels and money in his possession
    at the time of his disappearance, then he had undoubtedly been robbed, or
    perhaps murdered, on his way back to the hotel, and if Lord Mountnewte had
    been the last to speak to him on that fatal night, then Lord Mountnewte must
    be able to throw some light on the mysterious occurrence.</p>
  <p>Our fellows at the Yard were abnormally active. It seemed, on the face of
    it, impossible that a man, healthy, vigorous, and admittedly sober, should
    vanish in London between Piccadilly Circus and Cromwell Road without leaving
    the slightest trace of himself or of the valuables said to have been in his
    possession.</p>
  <p>Of course, Lord Mountnewte was closely questioned. He was a young Guardsman
    of the usual pattern, and, after a great deal of vapid talk which irritated
    Detective-Inspector Saunders not a little, he made the following statement&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I certainly am acquainted with Miss Lulu Fay. On the night in question
    I was standing outside the Troc, when I saw this young lady at her own carriage
    window talking to a tall man in an Inverness cape. She had, earlier in the
    day, refused my invitation to supper, saying that she was not feeling very
    well, and would go home directly after the theatre; therefore I felt, naturally,
    a little vexed. I was just about to hail a taxi, meaning to go on to the
    club, when, to my intense astonishment, the man in the Inverness cape came
    up to me and asked me if I could tell him the best way to get back to Cromwell
    Road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo; asked Saunders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I walked a few steps with him and put him on his way,&rdquo; replied
    Lord Mountnewte, blandly.</p>
  <p>In Saunder&rsquo;s own expressive words, he thought that story &ldquo;fishy.&rdquo; He
    could not imagine the arm of coincidence being quite so long as to cause
    these two men&mdash;who presumably were both in love with the same girl,
    and who had just met at a moment when one of them was obviously suffering
    pangs of jealously&mdash;to hold merely a topographical conversation with
    one another. But it was equally difficult to suppose that the eldest son
    and heir of the Marquis of Loam should murder a successful rival and then
    rob him in the streets of London.</p>
  <p>Moreover, here came the eternal and unanswerable questions: If Lord Mountnewte
    had murdered Leonard Marvell, where and how had he done it, and what had
    he done with the body?</p>
  <p>I dare say you are wondering by this time why I have said nothing about
    the maid, Rosie Campbell.</p>
  <p>Well, plenty of very clever people (I mean those who write letters to the
    papers and give suggestions to every official department in the kingdom)
    thought that the police ought to keep a very strict eye upon that pretty
    Scotch lassie. For she was very pretty, and had quaint, demure ways which
    rendered her singularly attractive, in spite of the fact that, for most masculine
    tastes, she would have been considered too tall. Of course, Saunders and
    Danvers kept an eye on her&mdash;you may be sure of that&mdash;and got a
    good deal of information about her from the people at the hotel. Most of
    it, unfortunately, was irrelevant to the case. She was maid-attendant to
    Miss Marvell, who was feeble in health, and who went out but little. Rosie
    waited on her master and mistress upstairs, carrying their meals to their
    private room, and doing their bedrooms. The rest of the day she was fairly
    free, and was quite sociable downstairs with the hotel staff.</p>
  <p>With regard to her movements and actions on that memorable 3rd of February,
    Saunders&mdash;though he worked very hard&mdash;could glean but little useful
    information. You see, in a hotel of that kind, with an average of thirty
    to forty guests at one time, it is extremely difficult to state positively
    what any one person did or did not do on that particular day.</p>
  <p>Most people at the Scotia remembered that Miss Marvell dined in the <i>table
      d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te </i>room on that 3rd of February; this she did about
      once a fortnight, when her maid had an evening &ldquo;out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hotel staff also recollected fairly distinctly that Miss Rosie Campbell
    was not in the steward&rsquo;s room at supper-time that evening, but no one
    could remember definitely when she came in.</p>
  <p>One of the chambermaids who occupied the bedroom adjoining hers, said she
    heard her moving about soon after midnight; the hall porter declared that
    he saw her come in just before half-past twelve when he closed the doors
    for the night.</p>
  <p>But one of the ground-floor valets said that, on the morning of the 4th,
    he saw Miss Marvell&rsquo;s maid, in hat and coat, slip into the house and
    upstairs, very quickly and quietly, soon after the front doors were opened,
    namely, about 7.0 a.m.</p>
  <p>Here, of course, was a direct contradiction between the chambermaid and
    hall porter on the one side, and the valet on the other, whilst Miss Marvell
    said that Campbell came into her room and made her some tea long before seven
    o&rsquo;clock every morning, including that of the 4th.</p>
  <p>I assure you our fellows at the Yard were ready to tear their hair out by
    the roots, from sheer aggravation at this maze of contradictions which met
    them at every turn.</p>
  <p>The whole thing seemed so simple. There was nothing &ldquo;to it&rdquo; as
    it were, and but very little real suggestion of foul play, and yet Mr. Leonard
    Marvell had disappeared, and no trace of him could be found.</p>
  <p>Everyone now talked freely of murder. London is a big town, and this would
    not have been the first instance of a stranger&mdash;for Mr. Leonard Marvell
    was practically a stranger in London&mdash;being enticed to a lonely part
    of the city on a foggy night, and there done away with and robbed, and the
    body hidden in an out-of-the-way cellar, where it might not be discovered
    for months to come.</p>
  <p>But the newspaper-reading public is notably fickle, and Mr. Leonard Marvell
    was soon forgotten by everyone save the chief and the batch of our fellows
    who had charge of the case.</p>
  <p>Thus I heard through Danvers one day that Rosie Campbell had left Miss Marvell&rsquo;s
    employ, and was living in rooms in Findlater Terrace, near Walham Green.</p>
  <p>I was alone in our Maida Vale flat at the time, my dear lady having gone
    to spend the week-end with the Dowager Lady Loam, who was an old friend of
    hers; nor, when she returned, did she seem any more interested in Rosie Campbell&rsquo;s
    movements than she had been hitherto.</p>
  <p>Yet another month went by, and I for one had absolutely ceased to think
    of the man in the Inverness cape, who had so mysteriously and so completely
    vanished in the very midst of busy London, when, one morning early in January,
    Lady Molly made her appearance in my room, looking more like the landlady
    of a disreputable gambling-house than anything else I could imagine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in the world&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I think I look the part,&rdquo; she replied, surveying with
    obvious complacency the extraordinary figure which confronted her in the
    glass.</p>
  <p>My dear lady had on a purple cloth coat and skirt of a peculiarly vivid
    hue, and of a singular cut, which made her matchless figure look like a sack
    of potatoes. Her soft brown hair was quite hidden beneath a &ldquo;transformation,&rdquo; of
    that yellow-reddish tint only to be met with in very cheap dyes.</p>
  <p>As for her hat! I won&rsquo;t attempt to describe it. It towered above and
    around her face, which was plentifully covered with brick-red and with that
    kind of powder which causes the cheeks to look a deep mauve.</p>
  <p>My dear lady looked, indeed, a perfect picture of appalling vulgarity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going in this elegant attire?&rdquo; I asked in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have taken rooms in Findlater Terrace,&rdquo; she replied lightly. &ldquo;I
    feel that the air of Walham Green will do us both good. Our amiable, if somewhat
    slatternly, landlady expects us in time for luncheon. You will have to keep
    rigidly in the background, Mary, all the while we are there. I said that
    I was bringing an invalid niece with me, and, as a preliminary, you may as
    well tie two or three thick veils over your face. I think I may safely promise
    that you won&rsquo;t be dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And we certainly were not dull during our brief stay at 34, Findlater Terrace,
    Walham Green. Fully equipped, and arrayed in our extraordinary garments,
    we duly arrived there, in a rickety four-wheeler, on the top of which were
    perched two seedy-looking boxes.</p>
  <p>The landlady was a toothless old creature, who apparently thought washing
    a quite unnecessary proceeding. In this she was evidently at one with every
    one of her neighbours. Findlater Terrace looked unspeakably squalid; groups
    of dirty children congregated in the gutters and gave forth discordant shrieks
    as our cab drove up.</p>
  <p>Through my thick veils I thought that, some distance down the road, I spied
    a horsy-looking man in ill-fitting riding-breeches and gaiters, who vaguely
    reminded me of Danvers.</p>
  <p>Within half an hour of our installation, and whilst we were eating a tough
    steak over a doubtful table cloth, my dear lady told me that she had been
    waiting a full month, until rooms in this particular house happened to be
    vacant. Fortunately the population in Findlater Terrace is always a shifting
    one, and Lady Molly had kept a sharp eye on No. 34, where, on the floor above,
    lived Miss Rosie Campbell. Directly the last set of lodgers walked out of
    the ground-floor rooms, we were ready to walk in.</p>
  <p>My dear lady&rsquo;s manners and customs, whilst living at the above aristocratic
    address, were fully in keeping with her appearance. The shrill, rasping voice
    which she assumed echoed from attic to cellar.</p>
  <p>One day I heard her giving vague hints to the landlady that her husband,
    Mr. Marcus Stein, had had a little trouble with the police about a small
    hotel which he had kept somewhere near Fitzroy Square, and where &ldquo;young
    gentlemen used to come and play cards of a night.&rdquo; The landlady was
    also made to understand that the worthy Mr. Stein was now living temporarily
    at His Majesty&rsquo;s expense, whilst Mrs. Stein had to live a somewhat
    secluded life, away from her fashionable friends.</p>
  <p>The misfortunes of the pseudo Mrs. Stein in no way marred the amiability
    of Mrs. Tredwen, our landlady. The inhabitants of Findlater Terrace care
    very little about the antecedents of their lodgers, so long as they pay their
    week&rsquo;s rent in advance, and settle their &ldquo;extras&rdquo; without
    much murmur.</p>
  <p>This Lady Molly did, with a generosity characteristic of an ex-lady of means.
    She never grumbled at the quantity of jam and marmalade which we were supposed
    to have consumed every week, and which anon reached titanic proportions.
    She tolerated Mrs. Tredwen&rsquo;s cat, tipped Ermyntrude&mdash;the tousled
    lodging-house slavey&mdash;lavishly, and lent the upstairs lodger her spirit-lamp
    and curling-tongs when Miss Rosie Campbell&rsquo;s got out of order.</p>
  <p>A certain degree of intimacy followed the loan of those curling-tongs. Miss
    Campbell, reserved and demure, greatly sympathised with the lady who was
    not on the best of terms with the police. I kept steadily in the background.
    The two ladies did not visit each other&rsquo;s rooms, but they held long
    and confidential conversations on the landings, and I gathered, presently,
    that the pseudo Mrs. Stein had succeeded in persuading Rosie Campbell that,
    if the police were watching No. 34, Findlater Terrace, at all, it was undoubtedly
    on account of the unfortunate Mr. Stein&rsquo;s faithful wife.</p>
  <p>I found it a little difficult to fathom Lady Molly&rsquo;s intentions. We
    had been in the house over three weeks, and nothing whatever had happened.
    Once I ventured on a discreet query as to whether we were to expect the sudden
    re-appearance of Mr. Leonard Marvell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For if that&rsquo;s all about it,&rdquo; I argued, &ldquo;then surely
    the men from the Yard could have kept the house in view, without all this
    inconvenience and masquerading on our part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But to this tirade my dear lady vouchsafed no reply.</p>
  <p>She and her newly acquired friend were, about this time, deeply interested
    in the case known as the &ldquo;West End Shop Robberies,&rdquo; which no
    doubt you recollect, since they occurred such a very little while ago. Ladies
    who were shopping in the large drapers&rsquo; emporiums during the crowded
    and busy sale time, lost reticules, purses, and valuable parcels, without
    any trace of the clever thief being found.</p>
  <p>The drapers, during sale-time, invariably employ detectives in plain clothes
    to look after their goods, but in this case it was the customers who were
    robbed, and the detectives, attentive to every attempt at &ldquo;shop-lifting,&rdquo; had
    had no eyes for the more subtle thief.</p>
  <p>I had already noticed Miss Rosie Campbell&rsquo;s keen look of excitement
    whenever the pseudo Mrs. Stein discussed these cases with her. I was not
    a bit surprised, therefore, when, one afternoon at about teatime, my dear
    lady came home from her habitual walk, and, at the top of her shrill voice,
    called out to me from the hall:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary! Mary! they&rsquo;ve got the man of the shop robberies. He&rsquo;s
    given the silly police the slip this time, but they know who he is now, and
    I suppose they&rsquo;ll get him presently. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t anybody I
    know,&rdquo; she added, with that harsh, common laugh which she had adopted
    for her part.</p>
  <p>I had come out of the room in response to her call, and was standing just
    outside our own sitting-room door. Mrs. Tredwen, too, bedraggled and unkempt,
    as usual, had sneaked up the area steps, closely followed by Ermyntrude.</p>
  <p>But on the half-landing just above us the trembling figure of Rosie Campbell,
    with scared white face and dilated eyes, looked on the verge of a sudden
    fall.</p>
  <p>Still talking shrilly and volubly, Lady Molly ran up to her, but Campbell
    met her half-way, and the pseudo Mrs. Stein, taking vigorous hold of her
    wrist, dragged her into our own sitting-room.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page248.jpg" width="510" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together, now,&rdquo; she said with rough kindness; &ldquo;that
    owl Tredwen is listening, and you needn&rsquo;t let her know too much. Shut
    the door, Mary. Lor&rsquo; bless you, m&rsquo;dear, I&rsquo;ve gone through
    worse scares than these. There! you just lie down on this sofa a bit. My
    niece&rsquo;ll make you a nice cup o&rsquo;tea; and I&rsquo;ll go and get
    an evening paper, and see what&rsquo;s going on. I suppose you are very interested
    in the shop robbery man, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have took on so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without waiting for Campbell&rsquo;s contradiction to this statement, Lady
    Molly flounced out of the house.</p>
  <p>Miss Campbell hardly spoke during the next ten minutes that she and I were
    left alone together. She lay on the sofa with eyes wide open, staring up
    at the ceiling, evidently still in a great state of fear.</p>
  <p>I had just got tea ready when Lady Molly came back. She had an evening paper
    in her hand, but threw this down on the table directly she came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could only get an early edition,&rdquo; she said breathlessly, &ldquo;and
    the silly thing hasn&rsquo;t got anything in it about the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew near to the sofa, and, subduing the shrillness of her voice, she
    whispered rapidly, bending down towards Campbell:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man hanging about at the corner down there. No, no;
    it&rsquo;s not the police,&rdquo; she added quickly, in response to the girl&rsquo;s
    sudden start of alarm.  &ldquo;Trust me, my dear, for knowing a &rsquo;tec
    when I see one! Why, I&rsquo;d smell one half a mile off. No; my opinion
    is that it&rsquo;s your man, my dear, and that he&rsquo;s in a devil of a
    hole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! he oughtn&rsquo;t to come here,&rdquo; ejaculated Campbell in
    great alarm.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get me into trouble and do himself no good.
    He&rsquo;s been a fool!&rdquo; she added, with a fierceness wholly unlike
    her usual demure placidity, &ldquo;getting himself caught like that. Now
    I suppose we shall have to hook it&mdash;if there&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I do anything to help you?&rdquo; asked the pseudo Mrs. Stein. &ldquo;You
    know I&rsquo;ve been through all this myself, when they was after Mr. Stein.
    Or perhaps Mary could do something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said the girl, after a slight pause, during which
    she seemed to be gathering her wits together; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write a note,
    and you shall take it, if you will, to a friend of mine&mdash;a lady who
    lives in the Cromwell Road. But if you still see a man lurking about at the
    corner of the street, then, just as you pass him, say the word &lsquo;Campbell,&rsquo; and
    if he replies &lsquo;Rosie,&rsquo; then give <i>him</i> the note. Will you
    do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will, my dear. Just you leave it all to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the pseudo Mrs. Stein brought ink and paper and placed them on the table.
    Rosie Campbell wrote a brief note, and then fastened it down with a bit of
    sealing-wax before she handed it over to Lady Molly. The note was addressed
    to Miss Marvell, Scotia Hotel, Cromwell Road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give
    the note to the man unless he says &lsquo;Rosie&rsquo; in reply to the word &lsquo;Campbell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;all right!&rdquo; said Lady Molly, slipping the note
    into her reticule. &ldquo;And you go up to your room, Miss Campbell; it&rsquo;s
    no good giving that old fool Tredwen too much to gossip about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rosie Campbell went upstairs, and presently my dear lady and I were walking
    rapidly down the badly-lighted street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is the man?&rdquo; I whispered eagerly as soon as we were out
    of earshot of No. 34.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no man,&rdquo; replied Lady Molly, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the West End shop thief?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been caught yet, and won&rsquo;t be either, for he
    is far too clever a scoundrel to fall into an ordinary trap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not give me time to ask further questions, for presently, when we
    had reached Reporton Square, my dear lady handed me the note written by Campbell,
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go straight on to the Scotia Hotel, and ask for Miss Marvell; send
    up the note to her, but don&rsquo;t let her see you, as she knows you by
    sight. I must see the chief first, and will be with you as soon as possible.
    Having delivered the note, you must hang about outside as long as you can.
    Use your wits; she must not leave the hotel before I see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no hansom to be got in this elegant quarter of the town, so, having
    parted from my dear lady, I made for the nearest Underground station, and
    took a train for South Kensington.</p>
  <p>Thus it was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock before I reached the Scotia. In answer
    to my inquiries for Miss Marvell, I was told that she was ill in bed and
    could see no one. I replied that I had only brought a note for her, and would
    wait for a reply.</p>
  <p>Acting on my dear lady&rsquo;s instructions, I was as slow in my movements
    as ever I could be, and was some time in finding the note and handing it
    to a waiter, who then took it upstairs.</p>
  <p>Presently he returned with the message: &ldquo;Miss Marvell says there is
    no answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon I asked for pen and paper at the office, and wrote the following
    brief note on my own responsibility, using my wits as my dear lady had bidden
    me to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, madam,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;will you send just a line to
    Miss Rosie Campbell? She seems very upset and frightened at some news she
    has had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more the waiter ran upstairs, and returned with a sealed envelope,
    which I slipped into my reticule.</p>
  <p>Time was slipping by very slowly. I did not know how long I should have
    to wait outside in the cold, when, to my horror, I heard a hard voice, with
    a marked Scotch accent, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going out, waiter, and shan&rsquo;t be back to dinner. Tell
    them to lay a little cold supper upstairs in my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment Miss Marvell, with coat, hat, and veil, was descending the
    stairs.</p>
  <p>My plight was awkward. I certainly did not think it safe to present myself
    before the lady; she would undoubtedly recollect my face. Yet I had orders
    to detain her until the appearance of Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>Miss Marvell seemed in no hurry. She was putting on her gloves as she came
    downstairs. In the hall she gave a few more instructions to the porter, whilst
    I, in a dark corner in the background, was vaguely planning an assault or
    an alarm of fire.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, at the hotel entrance, where the porter was obsequiously holding
    open the door for Miss Marvell to pass through, I saw the latter&rsquo;s
    figure stiffen; she took one step back as if involuntarily, then, equally
    quickly, attempted to dart across the threshold, on which a group&mdash;composed
    of my dear lady, of Saunders, and of two or three people scarcely distinguishable
    in the gloom beyond&mdash;had suddenly made its appearance.</p>
  <p>Miss Marvell was forced to retreat into the hall; already I had heard Saunder&rsquo;s
    hurriedly whispered words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try and not make a fuss in this place, now. Everything can go off
    quietly, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Danvers and Cotton, whom I knew well, were already standing one each side
    of Miss Marvell, whilst suddenly amongst this group I recognised Fanny, the
    wife of Danvers, who is one of our female searchers at the yard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we go up to your own room?&rdquo; suggested Saunders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that is quite unnecessary,&rdquo; interposed Lady Molly. &ldquo;I
    feel convinced that Mr. Leonard Marvell will yield to the inevitable quietly,
    and follow you without giving any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marvell, however, did make a bold dash for liberty. As Lady Molly had said
    previously, he was far too clever to allow himself to be captured easily.
    But my dear lady had been cleverer. As she told me subsequently, she had
    from the first suspected that the trio who lodged at the Scotia Hotel were
    really only a duo&mdash;namely, Leonard Marvell and his wife. The latter
    impersonated a maid most of the time; but among these two clever people the
    three characters were interchangeable. Of course, there was no Miss Marvell
    at all. Leonard was alternately dressed up as man or woman, according to
    the requirements of his villainies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As soon as I heard that Miss Marvell was very tall and bony,&rdquo; said
    Lady Molly, &ldquo;I thought that there might be a possibility of her being
    merely a man in disguise. Then there was the fact&mdash;but little dwelt
    on by either the police or the public&mdash;that no one seems ever to have
    seen brother and sister together, nor was the entire trio ever seen at one
    and the same time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On that 3rd of February Leonard Marvell went out. No doubt he changed
    his attire in a lady&rsquo;s waiting-room at one of the railway stations;
    subsequently he came home, now dressed as Miss Marvell, and had dinner in
    the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> room so as to set up a fairly plausible
    alibi. But ultimately it was his wife, the pseudo Rosie Campbell, who stayed
    indoors that night, whilst he, Leonard Marvell, when going out after dinner,
    impersonated the maid until he was clear of the hotel; then he reassumed
    his male clothes once more, no doubt in the deserted waiting-room of some
    railway station, and met Miss Lulu Fay at supper, subsequently returning
    to the hotel in the guise of the maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see the game of criss-cross, don&rsquo;t you? This interchanging
    of characters was bound to baffle everyone. Many clever scoundrels have assumed
    disguises, sometimes impersonating members of the opposite sex to their own,
    but never before have I known two people play the part of three. Thus, endless
    contradictions followed as to the hour when Campbell the maid went out and
    when she came in, for at one time it was she herself who was seen by the
    valet, and at another it was Leonard Marvell dressed in her clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was also clever enough to accost Lord Mountnewte in the open street,
    thus bringing further complications into this strange case.</p>
  <p>After the successful robbery of Miss Fay&rsquo;s diamonds, Leonard Marvell
    and his wife parted for awhile. They were waiting for an opportunity to get
    across the Channel and there turn their booty into solid cash. Whilst Mrs.
    Marvell, <i>alias</i> Rosie Campbell, led a retired life in Findlater Terrace,
    Leonard kept his hand in with West End shop robberies.</p>
  <p>Then Lady Molly entered the lists. As usual, her scheme was bold and daring;
    she trusted her own intuition and acted accordingly.</p>
  <p>When she brought home the false news that the author of the shop robberies
    had been spotted by the police, Rosie Campbell&rsquo;s obvious terror confirmed
    her suspicions. The note written by the latter to the so-called Miss Marvell,
    though it contained nothing in any way incriminating, was the crowning certitude
    that my dear lady was right, as usual, in all her surmises.</p>
  <p>And now Mr. Leonard Marvell will be living for a couple of years at the
    tax-payers&rsquo; expense; he has &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; temporarily from
    the public eye.</p>
  <p>Rosie Campbell&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> Mrs. Marvell&mdash;has gone to Glasgow.
    I feel convinced that two years hence we shall hear of the worthy couple
    again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWomanInTheBigHat"></a>The Woman In The Big Hat</b></h2>
  <p>Lady Molly always had the idea that if the finger of Fate had pointed to
    Mathis&rsquo; in Regent Street, rather than to Lyons&rsquo;, as the most
    advisable place for us to have a cup of tea that afternoon, Mr. Culledon
    would be alive at the present moment.</p>
  <p>My dear lady is quite sure&mdash;and needless to say that I share her belief
    in herself&mdash;that she would have anticipated the murderer&rsquo;s intentions,
    and thus prevented one of the most cruel and callous of crimes which were
    ever perpetrated in the heart of London.</p>
  <p>She and I had been to a matin&eacute;e of &ldquo;Trilby,&rdquo; and were
    having tea at Lyons&rsquo;, which is exactly opposite Mathis&rsquo; Vienna
    caf&eacute; in Regent Street. From where we sat we commanded a view of the
    street and of the caf&eacute;, which had been very crowded during the last
    hour.</p>
  <p>We had lingered over our toasted muffin until past six, when our attention
    was drawn to the unusual commotion which had arisen both outside and in the
    brilliantly lighted place over the road.</p>
  <p>We saw two men run out of the doorway, and return a minute or two later
    in company with a policeman. You know what is the inevitable result of such
    a proceeding in London. Within three minutes a crowd had collected outside
    Mathis&rsquo;. Two or three more constables had already assembled, and had
    some difficulty in keeping the entrance clear of intruders.</p>
  <p>But already my dear lady, keen as a pointer on the scent, had hastily paid
    her bill, and, without waiting to see if I followed her or not, had quickly
    crossed the road, and the next moment her graceful form was lost in the crowd.</p>
  <p>I went after her, impelled by curiosity, and presently caught sight of her
    in close conversation with one of our own men. I have always thought that
    Lady Molly must have eyes at the back of her head, otherwise how could she
    have known that I stood behind her now? Anyway, she beckoned to me, and together
    we entered Mathis&rsquo;, much to the astonishment and anger of the less
    fortunate crowd.</p>
  <p>The usually gay little place was indeed sadly transformed. In one corner
    the waitresses, in dainty caps and aprons, had put their heads together,
    and were eagerly whispering to one another whilst casting furtive looks at
    the small group assembled in front of one of those pretty alcoves, which,
    as you know, line the walls all round the big tea-room at Mathis&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Here two of our men were busy with pencil and note-book, whilst one fair-haired
    waitress, dissolved in tears, was apparently giving them a great deal of
    irrelevant and confused information.</p>
  <p>Chief Inspector Saunders had, I understood, been already sent for; the constables,
    confronted with this extraordinary tragedy, were casting anxious glances
    towards the main entrance, whilst putting the conventional questions to the
    young waitress. And in the alcove itself, raised from the floor of the room
    by a couple of carpeted steps, the cause of all this commotion, all this
    anxiety, and all these tears, sat huddled up on a chair, with arms lying
    straight across the marble-topped table, on which the usual paraphernalia
    of afternoon tea still lay scattered about. The upper part of the body, limp,
    backboneless, and awry, half propped up against the wall, half falling back
    upon the outstretched arms, told quite plainly its weird tale of death.</p>
  <p>Before my dear lady and I had time to ask any questions, Saunders arrived
    in a taxicab. He was accompanied by the medical officer, Dr. Townson, who
    at once busied himself with the dead man, whilst Saunders went up quickly
    to Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The chief suggested sending for you,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;he
    was &rsquo;phoning you when I left. There&rsquo;s a woman in this case, and
    we shall rely on you a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked my dear lady, whose fine eyes were
    glowing with excitement at the mere suggestion of work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have only a few stray particulars,&rdquo; replied Saunders, &ldquo;but
    the chief witness is that yellow-haired girl over there. We&rsquo;ll find
    out what we can from her directly Dr. Townson has given us his opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The medical officer, who had been kneeling beside the dead man, now rose
    and turned to Saunders. His face was very grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole matter is simple enough, so far as I am concerned,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;The man has been killed by a terrific dose of morphia&mdash;administered,
    no doubt, in this cup of chocolate,&rdquo; he added, pointing to a cup in
    which there still lingered the cold dregs of the thick beverage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But when did this occur?&rdquo; asked Saunders, turning to the waitress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she replied, speaking with obvious nervousness. &ldquo;The
    gentleman came in very early with a lady, somewhere about four. They made
    straight for this alcove. The place was just beginning to fill, and the music
    had begun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is the lady now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She went off almost directly. She had ordered tea for herself and
    a cup of chocolate for the gentleman, also muffins and cakes. About five
    minutes afterwards, as I went past their table, I heard her say to him. &lsquo;I
    am afraid I must go now, or Jay&rsquo;s will be closed, but I&rsquo;ll be
    back in less than half an hour. You&rsquo;ll wait for me, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did the gentleman seem all right then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the waitress. &ldquo;He had just begun to sip
    his chocolate, and merely said &lsquo;S&rsquo;long,&rsquo; as she gathered
    up her gloves and muff and then went out of the shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she has not returned since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you first notice there was anything wrong with this gentleman?&rdquo;  asked
    Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl with some hesitation, &ldquo;I looked
    at him once or twice as I went up and down, for he certainly seemed to have
    fallen all of a heap. Of course, I thought that he had gone to sleep, and
    I spoke to the manageress about him, but she thought that I ought to leave
    him alone for a bit. Then we got very busy, and I paid no more attention
    to him, until about six o&rsquo;clock, when most afternoon tea customers
    had gone, and we were beginning to get the tables ready for dinners. Then
    I certainly did think there was something wrong with the man. I called to
    the manageress, and we sent for the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the lady who was with him at first, what was she like? Would
    you know her again?&rdquo; queried Saunders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;you see, I have
    to attend to such crowds of people of an afternoon, I can&rsquo;t notice
    each one. And she had on one of those enormous mushroom hats; no one could
    have seen her face&mdash;not more than her chin&mdash;unless they looked
    right under the hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you know the hat again?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think I should,&rdquo; said the waitress. &ldquo;It was
    black velvet and had a lot of plumes. It was enormous,&rdquo; she added,
    with a sigh of admiration and of longing for the monumental headgear.</p>
  <p>During the girl&rsquo;s narrative one of the constables had searched the
    dead man&rsquo;s pockets. Among other items, he had found several letters
    addressed to Mark Culledon, Esq., some with an address in Lombard Street,
    others with one in Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue, Hampstead. The initials M. C.,
    which appeared both in the hat and on the silver mount of a letter-case belonging
    to the unfortunate gentleman, proved his identity beyond a doubt.</p>
  <p>A house in Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue does not, somehow, suggest a bachelor
    establishment. Even whilst Saunders and the other men were looking through
    the belongings of the deceased, Lady Molly had already thought of his family&mdash;children,
    perhaps a wife, a mother&mdash;who could tell?</p>
  <p>What awful news to bring to an unsuspecting, happy family, who might even
    now be expecting the return of father, husband, or son, at the very moment
    when he lay murdered in a public place, the victim of some hideous plot or
    feminine revenge!</p>
  <p>As our amiable friends in Paris would say, it jumped to the eyes that there
    was a woman in the case&mdash;a woman who had worn a gargantuan hat for the
    obvious purpose of remaining unidentifiable when the question of the unfortunate
    victim&rsquo;s companion that afternoon came up for solution. And all these
    facts to put before an expectant wife or an anxious mother!</p>
  <p>As, no doubt, you have already foreseen, Lady Molly took the difficult task
    on her own kind shoulders. She and I drove together to Lorbury House, Fitzjohn&rsquo;s
    Avenue, and on asking of the manservant who opened the door if his mistress
    were at home, we were told that Lady Irene Culledon was in the drawing-room.</p>
  <p>Mine is not a story of sentiment, so I am not going to dwell on that interview,
    which was one of the most painful moments I recollect having lived through.</p>
  <p>Lady Irene was young&mdash;not five-and-twenty, I should say&mdash;<i>petite</i> and
    frail-looking, but with a quiet dignity of manner which was most impressive.
    She was Irish, as you know, the daughter of the Earl of Athyville, and, it
    seems, had married Mr. Mark Culledon in the teeth of strenuous opposition
    on the part of her family, which was as penniless as it was aristocratic,
    whilst Mr. Culledon had great prospects and a splendid business, but possessed
    neither ancestors nor high connections. She had only been married six months,
    poor little soul, and from all accounts must have idolised her husband.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly broke the news to her with infinite tact, but there it was! It
    was a terrific blow&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;to deal to a young wife&mdash;now
    a widow; and there was so little that a stranger could say in these circumstances.
    Even my dear lady&rsquo;s gentle voice, her persuasive eloquence, her kindly
    words, sounded empty and conventional in the face of such appalling grief.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>OF course, everyone expected that the inquest would reveal something of
    the murdered man&rsquo;s inner life&mdash;would, in fact, allow the over-eager
    public to get a peep into Mr. Mark Culledon&rsquo;s secret orchard, wherein
    walked a lady who wore abnormally large velvet hats, and who nourished in
    her heart one of those terrible grudges against a man which can only find
    satisfaction in crime.</p>
  <p>Equally, of course, the inquest revealed nothing that the public did not
    already know. The young widow was extremely reticent on the subject of her
    late husband&rsquo;s life, and the servants had all been fresh arrivals when
    the young couple, just home from their honeymoon, organised their new household
    at Lorbury House.</p>
  <p>There was an old aunt of the deceased&mdash;a Mrs. Steinberg&mdash;who lived
    with the Culledons, but who at the present moment was very ill. Someone in
    the house&mdash;one of the younger servants, probably&mdash;very foolishly
    had told her every detail of the awful tragedy. With positively amazing strength,
    the invalid thereupon insisted on making a sworn statement, which she desired
    should be placed before the coroner&rsquo;s jury. She wished to bear solemn
    testimony to the integrity of her late nephew, Mark Culledon, in case the
    personality of the mysterious woman in the big hat suggested to evilly disposed
    minds any thought of scandal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark Culledon was the one nephew whom I loved,&rdquo; she stated
    with solemn emphasis. &ldquo;I have shown my love for him by bequeathing
    to him the large fortune which I inherited from the late Mr. Steinberg. Mark
    was the soul of honour, or I should have cut him out of my will as I did
    my other nephews and nieces. I was brought up in a Scotch home, and I hate
    all this modern fastness and smartness, which are only other words for what
    I call profligacy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Needless to say, the old lady&rsquo;s statement, solemn though it was, was
    of no use whatever for the elucidation of the mystery which surrounded the
    death of Mr. Mark Culledon. But as Mrs. Steinberg had talked of &ldquo;other
    nephews,&rdquo; whom she had cut out of her will in favour of the murdered
    man, the police directed inquiries in those various quarters.</p>
  <p>Mr. Mark Culledon certainly had several brothers and sisters, also cousins,
    who at different times&mdash;usually for some peccadillo or other&mdash;seemed
    to have incurred the wrath of the strait-laced old lady. But there did not
    appear to have been any ill-feeling in the family owing to this. Mrs. Steinberg
    was sole mistress of her fortune. She might just as well have bequeathed
    it <i>in toto</i> to some hospital as to one particular nephew whom she favoured,
    and the various relations were glad, on the whole, that the money was going
    to remain in the family rather than be cast abroad.</p>
  <p>The mystery surrounding the woman in the big hat deepened as the days went
    by. As you know, the longer the period of time which elapses between a crime
    and the identification of thc criminal, the greater chance the latter has
    of remaining at large.</p>
  <p>In spite of strenuous efforts and close questionings of every one of the
    employees at Mathis&rsquo;, no one could give a very accurate description
    of the lady who had tea with the deceased on that fateful afternoon.</p>
  <p>The first glimmer of light on the mysterious occurrence was thrown, about
    three weeks later, by a young woman named Katherine Harris, who had been
    parlour-maid at Lorbury House when first Mr. and Lady Irene Culledon returned
    from their honeymoon.</p>
  <p>I must tell you that Mrs. Steinberg had died a few days after the inquest.
    The excitement had been too much for her enfeebled heart. Just before her
    death she had deposited &pound;250 with her banker, which sum was to be paid
    over to any person giving information which would lead to the apprehension
    and conviction of the murderer of Mr. Mark Culledon.</p>
  <p>This offer had stimulated everyone&rsquo;s zeal, and, I presume, had aroused
    Katherine Harris to a realisation of what had all the while been her obvious
    duty.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly saw her in the chief&rsquo;s private office, and had much ado
    to disentangle the threads of the girl&rsquo;s confused narrative. But the
    main point of Harris&rsquo;s story was that a foreign lady had once called
    at Lorbury House, about a week after the master and mistress had returned
    from their honeymoon. Lady Irene was out at the time, and Mr. Culledon saw
    the lady in his smoking-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was a very handsome lady,&rdquo; explained Harris, &ldquo;and
    was beautifully dressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she wear a large hat?&rdquo; asked the chief .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember if it was particularly large,&rdquo; replied
    the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you remember what the lady was like?&rdquo; suggested Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, pretty well. She was very, very tall, and very good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you know her again if you saw her?&rdquo; rejoined my dear
    lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I think so,&rdquo; was Katherine Harris&rsquo;s reply.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, beyond this assurance the girl could say nothing very definite.
    The foreign lady seems to have been closeted with Mr. Culledon for about
    an hour, at the end of which time Lady Irene came home.</p>
  <p>The butler being out that afternoon it was Harris who let her mistress in,
    and as the latter asked no questions, the girl did not volunteer the information
    that her master had a visitor. She went back to the servants&rsquo; hall,
    but five minutes later the smoking-room bell rang, and she had to run up
    again. The foreign lady was then in the hall alone, and obviously waiting
    to be shown out. This Harris did, after which Mr. Culledon came out of his
    room, and, in the girl&rsquo;s on graphic words,  &ldquo;he went on dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I &rsquo;ad done anything so very wrong,&rdquo; she
    explained,  &ldquo;but the master seemed quite furious, and said I wasn&rsquo;t
    a proper parlour-maid, or I&rsquo;d have known that visitors must not be
    shown in straight away like that. I ought to have said that I didn&rsquo;t
    know if Mr. Culledon was in; that I would go and see. Oh, he did go on at
    me!&rdquo; continued Katherine Harris, volubly. &ldquo;And I suppose he complained
    to the mistress, for she give me notice the next day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you have never seen the foreign lady since?&rdquo; concluded
    Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she never come while I was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, how did you know she was foreign. Did she speak like
    a foreigner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;She did not say much&mdash;only
    asked for Mr. Culledon&mdash;but she looked French like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This unanswerable bit of logic concluded Katherine&rsquo;s statement. She
    was very anxious to know whether, if the foreign lady was hanged for murder,
    she herself would get the &pound;250.</p>
  <p>On Lady Molly&rsquo;s assurance that she certainly would, she departed in
    apparent content.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! we are no nearer than we were before,&rdquo; said the chief,
    with an impatient sigh, when the door had closed behind Katherine Harris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly, blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you consider that what we have heard just now has helped us to
    discover who was the woman in the big hat?&rdquo; retorted the chief, somewhat
    testily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied my dear lady, with her sweet smile; &ldquo;but
    it may help us to discover who murdered Mr. Culledon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With which enigmatical statement she effectually silenced the chief, and
    finally walked out of his office, followed by her faithful Mary.</p>
  <p>Following Katherine Harris&rsquo;s indications, a description of the lady
    who was wanted in connection with the murder of Mr. Culledon was very widely
    circulated, and within two days of the interview with the ex-parlour-maid
    another very momentous one took place in the same office.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly was at work with the chief over some reports, whilst I was taking
    shorthand notes at a side desk, when a card was brought in by one of the
    men, and the next moment, without waiting either for permission to enter
    or to be more formally announced, a magnificent apparition literally sailed
    into the dust-covered little back office, filling it with an atmosphere of
    Parma violets and russia leather .</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think that I had ever seen a more beautiful woman in my life.
    Tall, with a splendid figure and perfect carriage, she vaguely reminded me
    of the portraits one sees of the late Empress of Austria. This lady was,
    moreover, dressed to perfection, and wore a large hat adorned with a quantity
    of plumes.</p>
  <p>The chief had instinctively risen to greet her, whilst Lady Molly, still
    and placid, was eyeing her with a quizzical smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know who I am, sir,&rdquo; began the visitor as soon as she had
    sunk gracefully into a chair; &ldquo;my name is on that card. My appearance,
    I understand, tallies exactly with that of a woman who is supposed to have
    murdered Mark Culledon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said this so calmly, with such perfect self-possession, that I literally
    gasped. The chief, too, seemed to have been metaphorically lifted off his
    feet. He tried to mutter a reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, sir!&rdquo; she interrupted him,
    with a smile.  &ldquo;My landlady, my servant, my friends have all read the
    description of the woman who murdered Mr. Culledon. For the past twenty-four
    hours I have been watched by your police, therefore I have come to you of
    my own accord, before they came to arrest me in my flat. I am not too soon,
    am I?&rdquo; she asked, with that same cool indifference which was so startling,
    considering the subject of her conversation.</p>
  <p>She spoke English with a scarcely perceptible foreign accent, but I quite
    understood what Katherine Harris had meant when she said that the lady looked  &ldquo;French
    like.&rdquo; She certainly did not look English, and when I caught sight
    of her name on the card, which the chief had handed to Lady Molly, I put
    her down at once as Viennese. Miss Elizabeth L&ouml;wenthal had all the charm,
    the grace, the elegance, which one associates with Austrian women more than
    with those of any other nation.</p>
  <p>No wonder the chief found it difficult to tell her that, as a matter of
    fact, the police were about to apply for a warrant that very morning for
    her arrest on a charge of wilful murder .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know,&rdquo; she said, seeming to divine his thoughts; &ldquo;but
    let me tell you at once, sir, that I did not murder Mark Culledon. He treated
    me shamefully, and I would willingly have made a scandal just to spite him;
    he had become so respectable and strait-laced. But between scandal and murder
    there is a wide gulf. Don&rsquo;t you think so, madam,&rdquo; she added,
    turning for the first time towards Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied my dear lady, with the same quizzical
    smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A wide gulf which, no doubt, Miss Elizabeth L&ouml;wenthal will best
    be able to demonstrate to the magistrate to-morrow,&rdquo; rejoined the chief,
    with official sternness of manner.</p>
  <p>I thought that, for the space of a few seconds, the lady lost her self-assurance
    at this obvious suggestion&mdash;the bloom on her cheeks seemed to vanish,
    and two hard lines appeared between her fine eyes. But, frightened or not,
    she quickly recovered herself, and said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear sir, let us understand one another. I came here for
    that express purpose. I take it that you don&rsquo;t want your police to
    look ridiculous any more than I want a scandal. I don&rsquo;t want detectives
    to hang about round my flat, questioning my neighbours and my servants. They
    would soon find out that I did not murder Mark Culledon, of course; but the
    atmosphere of the police would hang round me, and I&mdash;I prefer Parma
    violets,&rdquo; she added, raising a daintily perfumed handkerchief to her
    nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you have come to make a statement?&rdquo; asked the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know. Mr.
    Culledon was engaged to marry me; then he met the daughter of an earl, and
    thought he would like her better as a wife than a simple Miss L&ouml;wenthal.
    I suppose I should be considered an undesirable match for a young man who
    has a highly respectable and snobbish aunt, who would leave him all her money
    only on the condition that he made a suitable marriage. I have a voice, and
    I came over to England two years ago to study English, so that I might sing
    in oratorio at the Albert Hall. I met Mark on the Calais-Dover boat, when
    he was returning from a holiday abroad. He fell in love with me, and presently
    he asked me to be his wife. After some demur, I accepted him; we became engaged,
    but he told me that our engagement must remain a secret, for he had an old
    aunt from whom he had great expectations, and who might not approve of his
    marrying a foreign girl, who was without connections and a professional singer.
    From that moment I mistrusted him, nor was I very astonished when gradually
    his affection for me seemed to cool. Soon after, he informed me, quite callously,
    that he had changed his mind, and was going to marry some swell English lady.
    I didn&rsquo;t care much, but I wanted to punish him by making a scandal,
    you understand. I went to his house just to worry him, and finally I decided
    to bring an action for breach of promise against him. It would have upset
    him, I know; no doubt his aunt would have cut him out of her will. That is
    all I wanted, but I did not care enough about him to murder him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow her tale carried conviction. We were all of us obviously impressed.
    The chief alone looked visibly disturbed, and I could read what was going
    on in his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say, Miss L&ouml;wenthal,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;the police
    would have found all this out within the next few hours. Once your connection
    with the murdered man was known to us, the record of your past and his becomes
    an easy one to peruse. No doubt, too,&rdquo; he added insinuatingly, &ldquo;our
    men would soon have been placed in possession of the one undisputable proof
    of your complete innocence with regard to that fateful afternoon spent at
    Mathis&rsquo; caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; she queried blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean, where I was during the time that Mark was being murdered
    in a tea shop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the chief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was out for a walk,&rdquo; she replied quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shopping, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You met some one who would remember the circumstance&mdash;or your
    servants could say at what time you came in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she repeated dryly; &lsquo;I met no one, for I took a
    brisk walk on Primrose Hill. My two servants could only say that I went out
    at three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon and returned after five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the little office for a moment or two. I could hear
    the scraping of the pen with which the chief was idly scribbling geometrical
    figures on his blotting pad.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly was quite still. Her large, luminous eyes were fixed on the beautiful
    woman who had just told us her strange story, with its unaccountable sequel,
    its mystery which had deepened with the last phrase which she had uttered.
    Miss L&ouml;wenthal, I felt sure, was conscious of her peril. I am not sufficiently
    a psychologist to know whether it was guilt or merely fear which was distorting
    the handsome features now, hardening the face and causing the lips to tremble.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper, which she then passed
    over to the chief. Miss L&ouml;wenthal was making visible efforts to steady
    her nerves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is all I have to tell you,&rdquo; she said, in a voice which
    sounded dry and harsh. &ldquo;I think I will go home now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she did not rise from her chair, and seemed to hesitate as if fearful
    lest permission to go were not granted her.</p>
  <p>To her obvious astonishment&mdash;and, I must add, to my own&mdash;the chief
    immediately rose and said, quite urbanely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you very much for the helpful information which you have
    given me. Of course, we may rely on your presence in town for the next few
    days, may we not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed greatly relieved, and all at once resumed her former charm of
    manner and elegance of attitude. The beautiful face was lit up by a smile.</p>
  <p>The chief was bowing to her in quite a foreign fashion, and in spite of
    her visible reassurance she eyed him very intently. Then she went up to Lady
    Molly and held out her hand.</p>
  <p>My dear lady took it without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation. I, who knew
    that it was the few words hastily scribbled by Lady Molly which had dictated
    the chief&rsquo;s conduct with regard to Miss L&ouml;wenthal, was left wondering
    whether the woman I loved best in all the world had been shaking hands with
    a murderess.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>No doubt you will remember the sensation which was caused by the arrest
    of Miss L&ouml;wenthal, on a charge of having murdered Mr. Mark Culledon,
    by administering morphia to him in a cup of chocolate at Mathis&rsquo; caf&eacute; in
    Regent Street.</p>
  <p>The beauty of the accused, her undeniable charm of manner, the hitherto
    blameless character of her life, all tended to make the public take violent
    sides either for or against her, and the usual budget of amateur correspondence,
    suggestions, recriminations and advice poured into the chief&rsquo;s office
    in titanic proportions.</p>
  <p>I must say that, personally, all my sympathies went out to Miss L&ouml;wenthal.
    As I have said before, I am no psychologist, but I had seen her in the original
    interview at the office, and I could not get rid of an absolutely unreasoning
    certitude that the beautiful Viennese singer was innocent.</p>
  <p>The magistrate&rsquo;s court was packed, as you may well imagine, on that
    first day of the inquiry; and, of course, sympathy with the accused went
    up to fever pitch when she staggered into the dock, beautiful still, despite
    the ravages caused by horror, anxiety, fear, in face of the deadly peril
    in which she stood.</p>
  <p>The magistrate was most kind to her; her solicitor was unimpeachably assiduous;
    even our fellows, who had to give evidence against her, did no more than
    their duty, and were as lenient in their statements as possible.</p>
  <p>Miss L&ouml;wenthal had been arrested in her flat by Danvers, accompanied
    by two constables. She had loudly protested her innocence all along, and
    did so still, pleading &ldquo;Not guilty&rdquo; in a firm voice.</p>
  <p>The great points in favour of the arrest were, firstly, the undoubted motive
    of disappointment and revenge against a faithless sweetheart, then the total
    inability to prove any kind of alibi, which, under the circumstances, certainly
    added to the appearance of guilt.</p>
  <p>The question of where the fatal drug was obtained was more difficult to
    prove. It was stated that Mr. Mark Culledon was director of several important
    companies, one of which carried on business as wholesale druggists.</p>
  <p>Therefore it was argued that the accused, at different times and under some
    pretext or other, had obtained drugs from Mr. Culledon himself. She had admitted
    to having visited the deceased at his office in the City, both before and
    after his marriage.</p>
  <p>Miss L&ouml;wenthal listened to all this evidence against her with a hard,
    set face, as she did also to Katherine Harris&rsquo;s statement about her
    calling on Mr. Culledon at Lorbury House, but she brightened up visibly when
    the various attendants at Mathis&rsquo; caf&eacute; were placed in the box.</p>
  <p>A very large hat belonging to the accused was shown to the witnesses, but,
    though the police upheld the theory that that was the headgear worn by the
    mysterious lady at the caf&eacute; on that fateful afternoon, the waitresses
    made distinctly contradictory statements with regard to it.</p>
  <p>Whilst one girl swore that she recognised the very hat, another was equally
    positive that it was distinctly smaller than the one she recollected, and
    when the hat was placed on the head of Miss L&ouml;wenthal, three out of
    the four witnesses positively refused to identify her.</p>
  <p>Most of these young women declared that though the accused, when wearing
    the big hat, looked as if she might have been the lady in question, yet there
    was a certain something about her which was different.</p>
  <p>With that vagueness which is a usual and highly irritating characteristic
    of their class, the girls finally parried every question by refusing to swear
    positively either for or against the identity of Miss L&ouml;wenthal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s different about her somehow,&rdquo; one
    of the waitresses asserted positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it that&rsquo;s different?&rdquo; asked the solicitor for
    the accused, pressing his point.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; was the perpetual, maddening reply.</p>
  <p>Of course the poor young widow had to be dragged into the case, and here,
    I think, opinions and even expressions of sympathy were quite unanimous.</p>
  <p>The whole tragedy had been inexpressibly painful to her, of course, and
    now it must have seemed doubly so. The scandal which had accumulated round
    her late husband&rsquo;s name must have added the poignancy of shame to that
    of grief. Mark Culledon had behaved as callously to the girl whom clearly
    he had married from interested, family motives, as he had to the one whom
    he had heartlessly cast aside.</p>
  <p>Lady Irene, however, was most moderate in her statements. There was no doubt
    that she had known of her husband&rsquo;s previous entanglement with Miss
    L&ouml;wenthal, but apparently had not thought fit to make him accountable
    for the past. She did not know that Miss L&ouml;wenthal had threatened a
    breach of promise action against her husband.</p>
  <p>Throughout her evidence she spoke with absolute calm and dignity, and looked
    indeed a strange contrast, in her closely fitting tailor-made costume of
    black serge and tiny black toque, to the more brilliant woman who stood in
    the dock.</p>
  <p>The two great points in favour of the accused were, firstly, the vagueness
    of the witnesses who were called to identify her, and, secondly, the fact
    that she had undoubtedly begun proceedings for breach of promise against
    the deceased. Judging by the latter&rsquo;s letters to her, she would have
    had a splendid case against him, which fact naturally dealt a severe blow
    to the theory as to motive for the murder.</p>
  <p>On the whole, the magistrate felt that there was not a sufficiency of evidence
    against the accused to warrant his committing her for trial; he therefore
    discharged her, and, amid loud applause from the public, Miss L&ouml;wenthal
    left the court a free woman.</p>
  <p>Now, I know that the public did loudly, and, to my mind, very justly, blame
    the police for that arrest, which was denounced as being as cruel as it was
    unjustifiable. I felt as strongly as anybody on the subject, for I knew that
    the prosecution had been instituted in defiance of Lady Molly&rsquo;s express
    advice, and in distinct contradiction to the evidence which she had collected.
    When, therefore, the chief asked my dear lady to renew her efforts in that
    mysterious case, it was small wonder that her enthusiasm did not respond
    to his anxiety. That she would do her duty was beyond a doubt, but she had
    very naturally lost her more fervent interest in the case.</p>
  <p>The mysterious woman in the big hat was still the chief subject of leading
    articles in the papers, coupled with that of the ineptitude of the police
    who could not discover her. There were caricatures and picture post-cards
    in all the shop windows of a gigantic hat covering the whole figure of its
    wearer, only the feet, and a very long and pointed chin, protruding from
    beneath the enormous brim. Below was the device, &ldquo;Who is she? Ask the
    police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One day&mdash;it was the second since the discharge of Miss L&ouml;wenthal&mdash;my
    dear lady came into my room beaming. It was the first time I had seen her
    smile for more than a week, and already I had guessed what it was that had
    cheered her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good news, Mary,&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;At last I&rsquo;ve
    got the chief to let me have a free hand. Oh, dear! what a lot of argument
    it takes to extricate that man from the tangled meshes of red tape!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prove that my theory is right as to who murdered Mark Culledon,&rdquo; she
    replied seriously; &ldquo;and as a preliminary we&rsquo;ll go and ask his
    servants at Lorbury House a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was then three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. At Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    bidding, I dressed somewhat smartly, and together we went off in a taxi to
    Fitzjohn&rsquo;s Avenue.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly had written a few words on one of her cards, urgently requesting
    an interview with Lady Irene Culledon. This she handed over to the man-servant
    who opened the door at Lorbury House. A few moments later we were sitting
    in the cosy boudoir. The young widow, high-bred and dignified in her tight-fitting
    black gown, sat opposite to us, her white hands folded demurely before her,
    her small head, with its very close coiffure, bent in closest attention towards
    Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I most sincerely hope, Lady Irene,&rdquo; began my dear lady, in
    her most gentle and persuasive voice, &ldquo;that you will look with all
    possible indulgence on my growing desire&mdash;shared, I may say, by all
    my superiors at Scotland Yard&mdash;to elucidate the mystery which still
    surrounds your late husband&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly paused, as if waiting for encouragement to proceed. The subject
    must have been extremely painful to the young widow; nevertheless she responded
    quite gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can understand that the police wish to do their duty in the matter;
    as for me, I have done all, I think, that could be expected of me. I am not
    made of iron, and after that day in the police court&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She checked herself, as if afraid of having betrayed more emotion than was
    consistent with good breeding, and concluded more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fully appreciate your feelings in the matter,&rdquo; said Lady
    Molly,  &ldquo;but you would not mind helping us&mdash;would you?&mdash;in
    a passive way, if you could, by some simple means, further the cause of justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it you want me to do?&rdquo; asked Lady Irene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only to allow me to ring for two of your maids and to ask them a
    few questions. I promise you that they shall not be of such a nature as to
    cause you the slightest pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment I thought that the young widow hesitated, then, without a word,
    she rose and rang the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which of my servants did you wish to see?&rdquo; she asked, turning
    to my dear lady as soon as the butler entered in answer to the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your own maid and your parlour-maid, if I may,&rdquo; replied Lady
    Molly.</p>
  <p>Lady Irene gave the necessary orders, and we all sat expectant and silent
    until, a minute or two later, two girls entered the room. One wore a cap
    and apron, the other, in neat black dress and dainty lace collar, was obviously
    the lady&rsquo;s maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This lady,&rdquo; said their mistress, addressing the two girls, &ldquo;wishes
    to ask you a few questions. She is a representative of the police, so you
    had better do your best to satisfy her with your answers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly pleasantly&mdash;choosing not to notice
    the tone of acerbity with which the young widow had spoken, nor the unmistakable
    barrier of hostility and reserve which her words had immediately raised between
    the young servants and the &ldquo;representative of the police&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;what
    I am going to ask these two young ladies is neither very difficult nor very
    unpleasant. I merely want their kind help in a little comedy which will have
    to be played this evening, in order to test the accuracy of certain statements
    made by one of the waitresses at Mathis&rsquo;  tea shop with regard to the
    terrible tragedy which has darkened this house. You will do that much, will
    you not?&rdquo; she added, speaking directly to the maids.</p>
  <p>No one can be so winning or so persuasive as my dear lady. In a moment I
    saw the girls&rsquo; hostility melting before the sunshine of Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do what we can, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a brave, good girl!&rdquo; replied my lady. &ldquo;You
    must know that the chief waitress at Mathis&rsquo; has, this very morning,
    identified the woman in the big hat who, we all believe, murdered your late
    master. Yes!&rdquo; she continued, in response to a gasp of astonishment
    which seemed to go round the room like a wave, &ldquo;the girl seems quite
    positive, both as regards the hat and the woman who wore it. But, of course,
    one cannot allow a human life to be sworn away without bringing every possible
    proof to bear on such a statement, and I am sure that everyone in this house
    will understand that we don&rsquo;t want to introduce strangers more than
    we can help into this sad affair, which already has been bruited abroad too
    much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused a moment; then, as neither Lady Irene nor the maids made any
    comment, she continued:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My superiors at Scotland Yard think it their duty to try and confuse
    the witness as much as possible in her act of identification. They desire
    that a certain number of ladies wearing abnormally large hats should parade
    before the waitress. Among them will be, of course, the one whom the girl
    has already identified as being the mysterious person who had tea with Mr.
    Culledon at Mathis&rsquo; that afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My superiors can then satisfy themselves whether the waitress is
    or is not so sure of her statement that she invariably picks out again and
    again one particular individual amongst a number of others or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; interrupted Lady Irene, dryly, &ldquo;you and your
    superiors do not expect my servants to help in such a farce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t look upon such a proceeding as a farce, Lady Irene,&rdquo; rejoined
    Lady Molly, gently. &ldquo;It is often resorted to in the interests of an
    accused person, and we certainly would ask the co-operation of your household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what they can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the two girls did not seem unwilling. The idea appealed to them, I felt
    sure; it suggested an exciting episode, and gave promise of variety in their
    monotonous lives.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure both these young ladies possess fine big hats,&rdquo; continued
    Lady Molly with an encouraging smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should not allow them to wear ridiculous headgear,&rdquo; retorted
    Lady Irene, sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have the one your ladyship wouldn&rsquo;t wear, and threw away,&rdquo; interposed
    the young parlour-maid. &ldquo;I put it together again with the scraps I
    found in the dusthole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was just one instant of absolute silence, one of those magnetic moments
    when Fate seems to have dropped the spool on which she was spinning the threads
    of a life, and is just stooping in order to pick it up.</p>
  <p>Lady Irene raised a black-bordered handkerchief to her lips, then said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mary. I never wear big hats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my lady,&rdquo; here interposed the lady&rsquo;s maid; &ldquo;but
    Mary means the one you ordered at Sanchia&rsquo;s and only wore the once&mdash;the
    day you went to that concert.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which day was that?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly, blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I couldn&rsquo;t forget that day,&rdquo; ejaculated the maid; &ldquo;her
    ladyship came home from the concert&mdash;I had undressed her, and she told
    me that she would never wear her big hat again&mdash;it was too heavy. That
    same day Mr. Culledon was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That hat would answer our purpose very well,&rdquo; said Lady Molly,
    quite calmly. &ldquo;Perhaps Mary will go and fetch it, and you had better
    go and help her put it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two girls went out of the room without another word, and there were
    we three women left facing one another, with that awful secret, only half-revealed,
    hovering in the air like an intangible spectre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, Lady Irene?&rdquo; asked Lady Molly, after
    a moment&rsquo;s pause, during which I literally could hear my own heart
    beating, whilst I watched the rigid figure of the widow in deep black crape,
    her face set and white, her eyes fixed steadily on Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove it!&rdquo; she said defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we can,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly, simply; &ldquo;at any
    rate, I mean to try. I have two of the waitresses from Mathis&rsquo; outside
    in a cab, and I have already spoken to the attendant who served you at Sanchia&rsquo;s,
    an obscure milliner in a back street near Portland Road. We know that you
    were at great pains there to order a hat of certain dimensions and to your
    own minute description; it was a copy of one you had once seen Miss L&ouml;wenthal
    wear when you met her at your late husband&rsquo;s office. We can prove that
    meeting, too. Then we have your maid&rsquo;s testimony that you wore that
    same hat once, and once only, the day, presumably, that you went out to a
    concert&mdash;a statement which you will find it difficult to substantiate&mdash;and
    also the day on which your husband was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! the public will laugh at you!&rdquo; retorted Lady Irene, still
    defiantly.  &ldquo;You would not dare to formulate so monstrous a charge!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will not seem monstrous when justice has weighed in the balance
    the facts which we can prove. Let me tell you a few of these, the result
    of careful investigation. There is the fact that you knew of Mr. Culledon&rsquo;s
    entanglement with Miss Elizabeth L&ouml;wenthal, and did your best to keep
    it from old Mrs. Steinberg&rsquo;s knowledge, realising that any scandal
    round her favourite nephew would result in the old lady cutting him&mdash;and
    therefore you&mdash;out of her will. You dismissed a parlour-maid for the
    sole reason that she had been present when Miss L&ouml;wenthal was shown
    into Mr. Culledon&rsquo;s study. There is the fact that Mrs. Steinberg had
    so worded her will that, in the event of her nephew dying before her, her
    fortune would devolve on you; the fact that, with Miss L&ouml;wenthal&rsquo;s
    action for breach of promise against your husband, your last hope of keeping
    the scandal from the old lady&rsquo;s ears had effectually vanished. You
    saw the fortune eluding your grasp; you feared Mrs. Steinberg would alter
    her will. Had you found the means, and had you dared, would you not rather
    have killed the old lady? But discovery would have been certain. The other
    crime was bolder and surer. You have inherited the old lady&rsquo;s millions,
    for she never knew of her nephew&rsquo;s earlier peccadillos.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All this we can state and prove, and the history of the hat, bought,
    and worn one day only, that same memorable day, and then thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A loud laugh interrupted her&mdash;a laugh that froze my very marrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is one fact you have forgotten, my lady of Scotland Yard,&rdquo; came
    in sharp, strident accents from the black-robed figure, which seemed to have
    become strangely spectral in the fast gathering gloom which had been enveloping
    the luxurious little boudoir. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t omit to mention the fact
    that the accused took the law into her own hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before my dear lady and I could rush to prevent her, Lady Irene Culledon
    had conveyed something&mdash;we dared not think what&mdash;to her mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find Danvers quickly, Mary!&rdquo; said Lady Molly, calmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    find him outside. Bring a doctor back with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as she spoke Lady Irene, with a cry of agony, fell senseless in my
    dear lady&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page288.jpg" width="515" height="750"></p>
  <p>The doctor, I may tell you, came too late. The unfortunate woman evidently
    had a good knowledge of poisons. She had been determined not to fail; in
    case of discovery, she was ready and able to mete out justice to herself.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think the public ever knew the real truth about the woman
    in the big hat. Interest in her went the way of all things. Yet my dear lady
    had been right from beginning to end. With unerring precision she had placed
    her dainty finger on the real motive and the real perpetrator of the crime&mdash;the
    ambitious woman who had married solely for money, and meant to have that
    money even at the cost of one of the most dastardly murders that have ever
    darkened the criminal annals of this country.</p>
  <p>I asked Lady Molly what it was that first made her think of Lady Irene as
    the possible murderess. No one else for a moment had thought her guilty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The big hat,&rdquo; replied my dear lady with a smile. &ldquo;Had
    the mysterious woman at Mathis&rsquo; been tall, the waitresses would not,
    one and all, have been struck by the abnormal size of the hat. The wearer
    must have been petite, hence the reason that under a wide brim only the chin
    would be visible. I at once sought for a small woman. Our fellows did not
    think of that, because they are men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You see how simple it all was!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SirJeremiahsWill"></a>Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s Will</b></h2>
  <p>Many people have asked me whether I knew when, and in what circumstances,
    Lady Molly joined the detective staff at Scotland Yard, who she was, and
    how she managed to keep her position in Society&mdash;as she undoubtedly
    did&mdash;whilst exercising a profession which usually does not make for
    high social standing.</p>
  <p>Well, of course, there is much that I have known all along about my dear
    lady&mdash;just as much, in fact, as her aristocratic friends and relations
    did&mdash;but I had promised her not to let the general public know anything
    of her private life until she gave me leave to do so.</p>
  <p>Now things have taken a different turn, and I can tell you all I know. But
    I must go back some years for that, and recall to your mind that extraordinary
    crime known in those days as the Baddock Will Case, which sent one of the
    most prominent and popular young men in Society to penal servitude&mdash;a
    life sentence, mind you, which was considered to be remarkably lenient by
    a number of people who thought that Captain de Mazareen ought to have been
    hanged.</p>
  <p>He was such a good-looking young soldier in those days. I specially remember
    him at the late Queen&rsquo;s funeral&mdash;one of the tallest men in the
    British Army, and with that peculiar charm of manner which, alas! one has
    ceased to associate with young Englishmen nowadays. If to these two undeniable
    advantages you add the one that Hubert de Mazareen was the dearly loved grandson
    of Sir Jeremiah Baddock, the multi-millionaire shipowner of Liverpool, you
    will realize how easy it was for that young Guardsman to ingratiate himself
    with every woman in Society, and more particularly with every mamma who had
    a marriageable daughter.</p>
  <p>But Fate and Love have a proverbial knack of making a muddle of things.
    Captain de Mazareen, with a bevy of pretty and eligible girls from whom to
    select a wife, chose to fall in love with the one woman in the whole of England
    who, in his grandfather&rsquo;s opinion, should have remained a stranger,
    even an enemy, to him.</p>
  <p>You remember the sad story&mdash;more than a quarter of a century old now&mdash;of
    Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s unhappy second marriage with the pretty French actress,
    Mlle. Ad&egrave;le Desty, who was then over thirty years younger than himself.
    He married her abroad, and never brought her to England. She made him supremely
    wretched for about three years, and finally ran away with the Earl of Flintshire,
    whom she had met at Monte Carlo.</p>
  <p>Well! it was with a daughter of that same Earl of Flintshire, Lady Molly
    Robertson-Kirk, that Captain Hubert de Mazareen fell desperately in love.
    Imagine Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s feelings when he heard of it.</p>
  <p>Captain Hubert, you must know, had resigned his commission in 1902 at his
    grandfather&rsquo;s request, when the latter&rsquo;s health first began to
    fail. He had taken up his permanent abode at Appledore Castle, Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s
    magnificent home in Cumberland, and, of course, it was generally understood
    that ultimately he would become possessed of the wealthy shipowner&rsquo;s
    millions as well as of the fine property, seeing that his mother had been
    Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s only child by the latter&rsquo;s first marriage.</p>
  <p>Lord Flintshire&rsquo;s property was quite close to Appledore; but, needless
    to say, old Sir Jeremiah never forgave his noble neighbour the cruel wrong
    he had suffered at his hands.</p>
  <p>The second Lady Baddock, afterwards Countess of Flintshire, has been dead
    twenty years. Neither the county nor the more exclusive sets of London ever
    received her, but her daughter Molly, who inherited all her beauty and none
    of her faults, was the idol of her father, and the acknowledged queen of
    county and town Society</p>
  <p>You see, it was the ancient, yet ever new, story of Cappelletti and Montecchi
    over again, and one day Captain Hubert de Mazareen had to tell Sir Jeremiah
    that he desired to marry the daughter of his grandfather&rsquo;s most cruel
    enemy.</p>
  <p>What the immediate result of that announcement was no one could say. Neither
    Sir Jeremiah nor Captain Hubert de Mazareen would have allowed servants or
    dependents to hear a word of disagreement that might have passed between
    them, much less to suspect that an unpleasant scene had occurred.</p>
  <p>Outwardly everything went on as usual at Appledore Castle for about a fortnight
    or so, after which Captain Hubert went away one day, ostensibly for a brief
    stay in London; but he never re-entered the doors of the Castle until after
    the dark veil of an appalling tragedy had begun to descend on the stately
    old Cumberland home.</p>
  <p>Sir Jeremiah bore up pretty well for a time, then he had a slight paralytic
    stroke and became a confirmed invalid. The postmaster at Appledore declared
    that after that many letters came, addressed to Sir Jeremiah in Captain Hubert&rsquo;s
    well-known handwriting and bearing the London postmark; but presumably the
    old gentleman felt bitterly irreconcilable towards his grandson, for Captain
    de Mazareen was never seen at the Castle.</p>
  <p>Soon the invalid grew more and more eccentric and morose. He ordered all
    the reception rooms of his magnificent home to be closed and shuttered, and
    he dismissed all his indoor servants, with the exception of his own male
    attendant and an old married couple named Bradley, who had been in his service
    for years, and who now did the little work that was required in what had
    once been one of the most richly appointed country mansions in England.</p>
  <p>Bitter resentment against his once dearly loved grandson, and against the
    man who had robbed him of his young wife twenty-five years ago, seemed to
    have cut off the old man from contact with the outside world.</p>
  <p>Thus matters stood until the spring of 1903, when Sir Jeremiah announced
    one morning to the three members of his household that Mr. Philip Baddock
    was coming to stay at the Castle, and that a room must be got ready immediately.</p>
  <p>Mr. Philip Baddock came that same evening. He was a young man of quite ordinary
    appearance: short, rather dark, with the somewhat uncouth manners suggestive
    of an upbringing in a country parsonage.</p>
  <p>His arrival created no little excitement in the neighbourhood. Who was Mr.
    Philip Baddock, and where did he come from? No one had ever heard of him
    before, and now&mdash;after a very brief time spent at the Castle&mdash;he
    seemed to be gradually taking up the position which originally had belonged
    to Captain Hubert.</p>
  <p>He took over the command of the small household, dismissing Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s
    personal attendant after a while and engaging another. He supervised the
    outdoor men, reducing the staff both in the gardens and the stables. He sold
    most of the horses and carriages, and presently bought a motor-car, which
    he at once took to driving all over the country.</p>
  <p>But he spoke to no one in the village, and soon, in answer to inquiries
    by one or two of Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s faithful friends and cronies, the reply
    came regularly from Mr. Philip Baddock that the invalid was disinclined for
    company. Only Doctor Thorne, the local practitioner, saw the patient. Sir
    Jeremiah, it was understood, was slowly sinking towards the grave; but his
    mind was quite clear, even if his temper was abnormal.</p>
  <p>One day Mr. Philip Baddock made inquiries in the village for a good chauffeur.
    George Taylor presented himself, and was at once told off to drive the car
    as quickly as possible to Carlisle, to the office of Mr. Steadman, solicitor,
    and to bring that gentleman back to the Castle as soon as he could come.</p>
  <p>The distance from Appledore to Carlisle is over fifty miles. It was seven
    o&rsquo;clock in the evening before George Taylor was back, bringing Mr.
    Steadman with him.</p>
  <p>The solicitor was received at the Castle door by old Bradley, and at Sir
    Jeremiah&rsquo;s door by Felkin, the new attendant, who showed him in. The
    interview between the invalid and Mr. Steadman lasted half an hour, after
    which the latter was driven back to Carlisle by George Taylor.</p>
  <p>That same evening a telegram was sent off by Mr. Philip Baddock to Captain
    de Mazareen in London, containing the few words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Jeremiah very ill. Come at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Twenty-four hours later Captain Hubert arrived at Appledore Castle&mdash;too
    late, however, to see his grandfather alive.</p>
  <p>Sir Jeremiah Baddock had died an hour before the arrival of his once so
    tenderly cherished grandson, and all hopes of a reconciliation had now been
    mercilessly annihilated by death.</p>
  <p>The end had come much more suddenly than Doctor Thorne had anticipated.
    He had seen the patient in the morning and thought that he might last some
    days. But when Sir Jeremiah had heard that Captain de Mazareen had been sent
    for he had worked himself into a state of such terrible agitation that the
    poor, overtaxed brain and heart finally gave way.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>THE events of those memorable days&mdash;in the early spring of 1904&mdash;are
    so graven on my memory that I can recount them as if they happened yesterday.</p>
  <p>I was maid to Lady Molly Robertson-Kirk at the time. Since then she has
    honoured me with her friendship.</p>
  <p>Directly after Captain Hubert&rsquo;s first estrangement from his grandfather
    she and I came down to Cumberland and lived very quietly at Kirk Hall, which,
    as you know, is but a stone&rsquo;s throw from Appledore.</p>
  <p>Here Captain Hubert paid my dear lady several visits. She had irrevocably
    made up her mind that their engagement was to be indefinitely prolonged,
    for she had a vague hope that, sooner or later, Sir Jeremiah would relent
    towards the grandson whom he had loved so dearly. At any rate there was a
    chance of it whilst the marriage had not actually taken place.</p>
  <p>Captain de Mazareen, mind you, was in no sense of the word badly off. His
    father had left him some &pound;25,000, and Lady Molly had a small private
    fortune of her own. Therefore I assure you that there was not a single mercenary
    thought behind this protracted engagement or Captain Hubert&rsquo;s desire
    for a reconciliation with his grandfather.</p>
  <p>The evening that he arrived at Appledore in response to Mr. Philip Baddock&rsquo;s
    telegram Lady Molly met him at the station. He sent his luggage on to Kirk
    Hall, and the two young people walked together as far as the Elkhorn Woods,
    which divide the Earl of Flintshire&rsquo;s property from Appledore itself.</p>
  <p>Here they met Mr. Steadman, the solicitor, who had motored over from Carlisle
    in response to an urgent summons from Sir Jeremiah Baddock, but whose car
    had broken down about two hundred yards up the road.</p>
  <p>It seems that the chauffeur had suggested his walking on through the woods,
    it being an exceptionally fine and mild spring evening, with a glorious full
    moon overhead, which lit up almost every turn of the path that cuts through
    the pretty coppice.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly had given me rendezvous at the edge of the wood, so that I might
    accompany her home after she had taken leave of Captain Hubert. It seems
    that the latter knew Mr. Steadman slightly, as we saw the two men shake hands
    with one another, then, after a few words of conversation, turn off to walk
    together through the wood. We then made our way back silently to Kirk Hall.</p>
  <p>My dear lady was inexpressibly sad. She appreciated very deeply the love
    which Captain Hubert bore for his grandfather, and was loath to see the final
    annihilation of all her hopes of an ultimate reconciliation between the two
    men.</p>
  <p>I had dressed Lady Molly for dinner, and she was just going downstairs when
    Captain de Mazareen arrived at the Hall.</p>
  <p>He announced the sad news of his grandfather&rsquo;s death and looked extremely
    dejected and upset.</p>
  <p>Of course, he stayed at the Hall, for Mr. Philip Baddock seemed quite to
    have taken command at Appledore Castle, and Captain Hubert did not care to
    be beholden to him for hospitality.</p>
  <p>My dear lady asked him what had become of Mr. Steadman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He started to walk
    with me through the wood, then he seemed to think that the tramp would be
    too much for him, and that the car could be put right very quickly. He preferred
    to drive round, and was quite sure that he would meet me at the Castle in
    less than half an hour. However, he never turned up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Molly asked several more questions about Sir Jeremiah, which Captain
    Hubert answered in a listless way. He had been met at the door of the Castle
    by Mr. Philip Baddock, who told him that the old gentleman had breathed his
    last half an hour before.</p>
  <p>I remember that we all went to bed that night feeling quite unaccountably
    depressed. It seemed that something more tragic than the natural death of
    a septuagenarian hovered in the air of these remote Cumberland villages.</p>
  <p>The next morning our strange premonitions were confirmed. Lord Flintshire,
    my dear lady, and Captain Hubert were sitting at breakfast when the news
    was brought to the Hall that Mr. Steadman, the Carlisle solicitor, had been
    found murdered in the Elkhorn Woods earlier in the morning. Evidently he
    had been stunned, and then done to death by a heavily-loaded stick or some
    similar weapon. When he was discovered in the early hours of the morning,
    he had, apparently, been dead some time. The local police were at once apprised
    of the terrible event, which created as much excitement as the death of the
    eccentric old millionaire at Appledore Castle.</p>
  <p>Everyone at Kirk Hall, of course, was keenly interested, and Captain de
    Mazareen went over to Appledore as soon as he could in order to place his
    information at the service of the police.</p>
  <p>It is a strange fact, but nevertheless a true one, that when a deadly peril
    arises such as now threatened Captain de Mazareen, the person most in danger
    is the last to be conscious of it.</p>
  <p>I am quite sure that Lady Molly, the moment she heard that Mr. Steadman
    had been murdered in the Elkhorn Woods, realized that the man she loved would
    be implicated in that tragedy in some sinister manner. But that is the intuition
    of a woman&mdash;of a woman who loves.</p>
  <p>As for Captain Hubert, he went about during the whole of that day quite
    unconscious of the abyss which already was yawning at his feet. He even discussed
    quite equably the several valuable bits of information which the local police
    had already collected, and which eventually formed a portion of that damning
    fabric of circumstantial evidence which was to bring him within sight of
    the gallows.</p>
  <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Philip Baddock sent him a stiff little note, saying
    that, as Captain de Mazareen was now the owner of Appledore Castle, he (Philip
    Baddock) did not desire to trespass a moment longer than was necessary on
    his relative&rsquo;s hospitality, and had arranged to stay at the village
    inn until after the funeral, when he would leave Cumberland.</p>
  <p>To this Captain Hubert sent an equally curt note saying that, as far as
    he knew, he had no say in the matter of anyone coming or going from the Castle,
    and that Mr. Philip Baddock must, of course, please himself as to whether
    he stayed there or not.</p>
  <p>So far, of course, the old gentleman&rsquo;s testamentary dispositions were
    not known. He had made a will in 1902 bequeathing Appledore and everything
    he possessed unconditionally to his beloved grandson, Hubert de Mazareen,
    whom he also appointed his sole executor. That will was lodged with Mr. Truscott,
    who had been solicitor to the deceased practically until the last moment,
    when Mr. Steadman, a new arrival at Carlisle, had been sent for.</p>
  <p>Whether that will had been revoked or not Mr. Truscott did not know; but,
    in the course of the afternoon, Lord Flintshire, whilst out driving, met
    the local superintendent of police, who told him that Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s
    senior partner&mdash;a Mr. Fuelling&mdash;had made a statement to the effect
    that Sir Jeremiah had sent for Mr. Steadman the day before his death and
    given instructions for the drafting of a new will whereby the old gentleman
    bequeathed Appledore and everything he possessed to his beloved grandson,
    Hubert de Mazareen, but only on the condition that the latter did not marry
    the daughter or any other relative of the Earl of Flintshire. In the event
    of Hubert de Mazareen disregarding this condition at any future time of his
    life, Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s entire fortune was to devolve on Philip Baddock,
    sole issue of testator&rsquo;s second marriage, with Ad&egrave;le Desty.
    The draft of this will, added Mr. Fuelling, was in Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s pocket
    ready for Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s signature on that fateful night when the unfortunate
    young solicitor was murdered.</p>
  <p>The draft had not been found in the murdered man&rsquo;s pocket. A copy
    of it, however, was in Mr. Fuelling&rsquo;s safe. But as this will had never
    been signed by the deceased the one of 1902 remained valid, and Captain Hubert
    de Mazareen remained unconditionally his grandfather&rsquo;s sole heir.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Events crowded thick and fast on that day&mdash;one of the most miserable
    I have ever lived through.</p>
  <p>After an early tea, which my dear lady had alone in her little boudoir,
    she sent me down to ask Captain Hubert to come up and speak to her. He did
    so at once, and I went into the next room&mdash;which was Lady Molly&rsquo;s
    bedroom&mdash;to prepare her dress for the evening.</p>
  <p>I had, of course, discreetly closed the door of communication between the
    two rooms, but after the first five minutes, Lady Molly deliberately reopened
    it, from which I gathered that she actually wished me to know what was going
    on.</p>
  <p>It was then a little after four o&rsquo;clock. I could hear Captain de Mazareen&rsquo;s
    voice, low-toned and infinitely tender. He adored my dear lady, but he was
    a very quiet man, and it was only by the passionate tensity of his attitude
    when he was near her that a shrewdly observant person could guess how deeply
    he cared. Now, through the open door, I could see his handsome head bowed
    very low, so that he could better look into her upturned eyes. His arms were
    round her, as if he were fighting the world for the possession of her, and
    would never let her go again. But there were tears in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hubert,&rdquo; she said after a while, &ldquo;I want you to marry
    me. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; he whispered, with an intensity of passionate longing
    which seemed to me then so unutterably pathetic that I could have sat down
    and had a good cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly earnestly, &ldquo;I mean as soon
    as possible&mdash;to-morrow, by special licence. You can wire to Mr. Hurford
    to-night, and he will see about it the first thing in the morning. We can
    travel up to town by the night train. Father and Mary will come with me.
    Father has promised, you know, and we can be married to-morrow . . . I think
    that would be the quickest way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause. I could well imagine how astonished and perturbed Captain
    Hubert must be feeling. It was such a strange request for a woman to make
    at such a time. I could see by the expression of his eyes that he was trying
    to read her thoughts. But she looked up quite serenely at him, and, frankly,
    I do not think that he had the slightest inkling of the sublime motive at
    the back of her strange insistence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You prefer to be married in London rather than here?&rdquo; he asked
    quite simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I desire to be married in London
    to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few moments later my dear lady quietly shut the door again, and I heard
    and saw no more; but half an hour later she called me. She was alone in her
    boudoir, bravely trying to smile through a veil of tears. Captain Hubert&rsquo;s
    footsteps could still be heard going along the hall below.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly listened until the final echo of that tread died away in the
    distance; then she buried her sweet face on my shoulder and sobbed her very
    heart out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get ready as quickly as you can, Mary,&rdquo; she said to me when
    the paroxysm had somewhat subsided. &ldquo;We go up to town by the 9.10.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is his lordship coming with us, my lady?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said, whilst a bright smile lit up her face. &ldquo;Father
    is simply grand . . . and yet he knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knows what, my lady?&rdquo; I queried instinctively, for Lady Molly
    had paused, and I saw a look of acute pain once more darken her soft, grey
    eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father knows,&rdquo; she said, slowly and almost tonelessly, &ldquo;that
    half an hour ago the police found a weighted stick in the Elkhorn Woods not
    far from the spot where Mr. Steadman was murdered. The stick has the appearance
    of having been very vigorously cleaned and scraped recently in spite of which
    fact tiny traces of blood are still visible on the leaden knob. The inspector
    showed my father that stick. I saw it too. It is the property of Captain
    Hubert de Mazareen, and by to-morrow, at the latest, it will be identified
    as such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the little boudoir now: a silence broken only by the
    sound of dull sobs which rose from my dear lady&rsquo;s overburdened heart.
    Lady Molly at this moment had looked into the future, and with that unerring
    intuition which has since been of such immense service to her she had already
    perceived the grim web which Fate was weaving round the destiny of the man
    she loved.</p>
  <p>I said nothing. What could I say? I waited for her to speak again.</p>
  <p>The first words she uttered after the terrible pronouncement which she had
    just made were:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear my white cloth gown to-morrow, Mary. It is the most
    becoming frock I have, and I want to look my best on my wedding day.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Captain Hubert De Mazareen was married to Lady Molly Robertson-Kirk by special
    licence on April 22nd, 1904, at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster.
    No one was present to witness the ceremony except the Earl of Flintshire
    and myself. No one was apprised of the event at the time, nor, until recently,
    did anyone know that Lady Molly of Scotland Yard was the wife of De Mazareen
    the convict.</p>
  <p>As you know, he was arrested at Appledore railway station the following
    morning and charged with the wilful murder of Alexander Steadman, solicitor,
    of Carlisle.</p>
  <p>Everything was against him from the first. The draft of the will which Mr.
    Steadman was taking up to Sir Jeremiah for signature supplied the motive
    for the alleged crime, and he was the last person seen in company with the
    murdered man.</p>
  <p>The chauffeur, George Taylor, who had driven to Carlisle to fetch Mr. Steadman,
    and brought him back that evening, explained how two of his tyres burst almost
    simultaneously after going over a bit of broken road close to the coppice.
    He had suggested to Mr. Steadman the idea of walking through the wood, and,
    as he had not two fresh tyres with him, he started pushing his car along,
    as the village was not more than half a mile away. He never saw Mr. Steadman
    again.</p>
  <p>The stick with which the terrible deed had been committed was the most damning
    piece of evidence against the accused. It had been identified as his property
    by more than one witness, and was found within twenty yards of the victim,
    obviously cleaned and scraped, but still bearing minute traces of blood.
    Moreover, it had actually been seen in Captain Hubert&rsquo;s hand by one
    or two of the porters when he arrived at Appledore Station on that fatal
    night, was met there by Lady Molly, and subsequently walked away with her
    previous to meeting Mr. Steadman on the edge of the wood.</p>
  <p>Captain de Mazareen, late of His Majesty&rsquo;s Household Brigade, was
    indicted for the wilful murder of Alexander Steadman, tried at the next assizes,
    found guilty, and condemned to be hanged. The jury, however, had strongly
    recommended him to mercy owing to his hitherto spotless reputation, and to
    the many services he had rendered his country during the last Boer War. A
    monster petition was sent up to the Home Office, and the sentence was commuted
    to twenty years&rsquo; penal servitude.</p>
  <p>That same year, Lady Molly applied for, and obtained, a small post on the
    detective staff of the police. From that small post she has worked her way
    upwards, analysing and studying, exercising her powers of intuition and of
    deduction, until at the present moment she is considered, by chiefs and men
    alike, the greatest authority among them on criminal investigation.</p>
  <p>The Earl of Flintshire died some three years ago. Kirk Hall devolved on
    a distant cousin, but Lady Molly has kept a small home at Kirk ready for
    her husband when he comes back from Dartmoor.</p>
  <p>The task of her life is to apply her gifts, and the obvious advantages at
    her disposal as a prominent member of the detective force, to prove the innocence
    of Captain Hubert de Mazareen, which she never doubted for a moment.</p>
  <p>But it was sublime, and at the same time deeply pathetic, to see the frantic
    efforts at self-sacrifice which these two noble-hearted young people made
    for one another&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>Directly Captain Hubert realised that, so far as proving his innocence was
    concerned, he was a lost man, he used every effort to release Lady Molly
    from the bonds of matrimony. The marriage had been, and was still, kept a
    profound secret. He determined to plead guilty to murder at his trial, and
    then to make a declaration that he had entrapped Lady Molly into a marriage,
    knowing at the time that a warrant was out for his arrest, and hoping, by
    his connection with the Earl of Flintshire, to obtain a certain amount of
    leniency. When he was sufficiently convinced that such a course was out of
    the question, he begged Lady Molly to bring a nullity suit against him. He
    would not defend it. He only wished to set her free.</p>
  <p>But the love she bore him triumphed over all. They did keep their marriage
    a secret, but she remained faithful to him in every thought and feeling within
    her, and loyal to him with her whole soul. Only I&mdash;once her maid, now
    her devoted friend&mdash;knew what she suffered, even whilst she threw herself
    heart and mind into her work.</p>
  <p>We lived mostly in our little flat in Maida Vale, but spent some delightful
    days of freedom and peace in the little house at Kirk. Hither&mdash;in spite
    of the terrible memories the place evoked&mdash;Lady Molly loved to spend
    her time in wandering over the ground where that mysterious crime had been
    committed which had doomed an innocent man to the life of a convict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That mystery has got to be cleared up, Mary,&rdquo; she would repeat
    to me with unswerving loyalty, &ldquo;and cleared up soon, before Captain
    de Mazareen loses all joy in life and all belief in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>I suspect you will be interested to hear something about Appledore Castle
    and about Mr. Philip Baddock, who had been so near getting an immense fortune,
    yet had it snatched from him before his very eyes.</p>
  <p>As Sir Jeremiah Baddock never signed the will of 1904, Captain de Mazareen&rsquo;s
    solicitors, on his behalf, sought to obtain probate of the former one, dated
    1902. In view of the terrible circumstances connected with the proposed last
    testamentary dispositions of the deceased, Mr. Philip Baddock was advised
    to fight that suit.</p>
  <p>It seems that he really was the son of Sir Jeremiah by the latter&rsquo;s
    second marriage with Mlle. Desty, but the old gentleman, with heartless vengefulness,
    had practically repudiated the boy from the first, and absolutely refused
    to have anything to do with him beyond paying for his maintenance and education,
    and afterwards making him a goodly allowance on the express condition that
    Philip&mdash;soon to become a young man&mdash;never set his foot on English
    soil.</p>
  <p>The condition was strictly complied with. Philip Baddock was born abroad,
    and lived abroad until 1903, when he suddenly appeared at Appledore Castle.
    Whether Sir Jeremiah, in a fit of tardy repentance, had sent for him, or
    whether he risked coming of his own accord, no one ever knew.</p>
  <p>Captain de Mazareen was not, until that same year 1903, aware of the existence
    of Philip Baddock any more than was anybody else, and he spent his last days
    of freedom in stating positively that he would not accept the terms of the
    will of 1902, but would agree to Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s fortune being divided
    up as it would have been if the old gentleman had died intestate. Thus Philip
    Baddock, the son, and Hubert de Mazareen, the grandson, received an equal
    share of Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s immense wealth, estimated at close upon &pound;2,000,000
    sterling.</p>
  <p>Appledore was put up for sale and bought in by Mr. Philip Baddock, who took
    up his residence there and gradually gained for himself a position in the
    county as one of the most wealthy magnates in the north of England. Thus
    he became acquainted with the present Lord Flintshire, and, later on, met
    my dear lady. She neither sought nor avoided his acquaintance, and even went
    once to a dinner party at Appledore Castle.</p>
  <p>That was lately, on the occasion of our last stay at Kirk. I had gone up
    to the Castle in the brougham so that I might accompany Lady Molly home,
    and had been shown into the library, whither my dear lady came in order to
    put on her cloak.</p>
  <p>While she was doing so Mr. Philip Baddock came in. He had a newspaper in
    his hand and seemed greatly agitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such extraordinary news, Lady Molly,&rdquo; he said, pointing to
    a head-line in the paper. &ldquo;You know, of course, that the other day
    a convict succeeded in effecting his escape from Dartmoor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew that,&rdquo; said my dear lady, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have reason to&mdash;to suppose,&rdquo; continued Mr. Baddock, &ldquo;that
    that convict was none other than my unfortunate nephew, De Mazareen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; rejoined Lady Molly, whose perfect calm and serene expression
    of face contrasted strangely with the obvious agitation of Philip Baddock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven knows that he tried to do me an evil turn,&rdquo; rejoined
    the latter after a while; &ldquo;but of course I bear him no grudge, now
    that the law has given me that which he tried to wrench from me&mdash;a just
    share of my father&rsquo;s possessions. Since he has thrown himself on my
    mercy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thrown himself on your mercy!&rdquo; ejaculated my dear lady, whose
    face had become almost grey with a sudden fear. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Mazareen is in my house at the present moment,&rdquo; replied
    Mr. Baddock, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It seems that he tramped here. I am afraid that his object was
    to try and see you. He wants money, of course. I happened to be out in the
    woods this afternoon, and saw him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; added Philip Baddock quickly, in response to an instinctive
    gasp of pain from Lady Molly; &ldquo;you need not have the slightest fear.
    My nephew is as safe with me as he would be in your own house. I brought
    him here, for he was exhausted with fatigue and want of food. None of my
    servants know of his presence in the house except Felkin, whom I can trust.
    By to-morrow he will have rested. . . . We&rsquo;ll make a start in the very
    early morning in my car; we&rsquo;ll get to Liverpool before midday. De Mazareen
    shall wear Felkin&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;no one will know him. One of the
    Baddock steamers is leaving for Buenos Ayres the same afternoon, and I can
    arrange with the captain. You need not have the slightest fear,&rdquo; he
    repeated, with simple yet earnest emphasis; &ldquo;I pledge you my word that
    De Mazareen will be safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should like to thank you,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he rejoined with a sad smile. &ldquo;It
    is a great happiness to me to be able to do this. . . . I know that you&mdash;you
    cared for him at one time. . . . I wish you had known and trusted me in those
    days&mdash;but I am glad of this opportunity which enables me to tell you
    that, even had my father signed his last will and testament, I should have
    shared his fortune with De Mazareen. The man whom you honoured with your
    love need never have resorted to crime in order to gain a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Philip Baddock paused. His eyes were fixed on Lady Molly with unmistakable
    love and an appeal for sympathy. I had no idea that he cared for her&mdash;nor
    had she, I am quite sure. Her heart belonged solely to the poor, fugitive
    convict, but she could not fail, I thought, to be touched by the other man&rsquo;s
    obvious sincerity and earnestness.</p>
  <p>There was silence in the room for a few moments. Only the old clock in its
    Sheraton case ticked on in solemn imperturbability.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly turned her luminous eyes on the man who had just made so simple,
    so touching a profession of love. Was she about to tell him that she was
    no longer free, that she bore the name of the man whom the law had ostracised
    and pronounced a criminal&mdash;who had even now, by this daring attempt
    at escape, added a few years to his already long term of punishment and another
    load to his burden of shame?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she asked quietly, &ldquo;that I might speak
    to Captain de Mazareen for a few moments without endangering his safety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Baddock did not reply immediately. He seemed to be pondering over the
    request. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will see that everything is safe. I don&rsquo;t think there need
    be any danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went out of the room, and my dear lady and I were left alone for a minute
    or two. She was so calm and serene that I marvelled at her self-control,
    and wondered what was going on in her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she said to me, speaking very quickly, for already we
    could hear two men&rsquo;s footsteps approaching the library door, &ldquo;you
    must station yourself just outside the front door; you understand? If you
    see or hear anything suspicious come and warn me at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I made ready to obey, and the next moment the door opened and Mr. Philip
    Baddock entered, accompanied by Captain Hubert.</p>
  <p>I smothered the involuntary sob which rose to my throat at sight of the
    man who had once been the most gallant, the handsomest soldier I had ever
    seen. I had only just time to notice that Mr. Baddock prepared to leave the
    room again immediately. At the door he turned back and said to Lady Molly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Felkin has gone down to the lodge. If he hears or sees anything that
    seems suspicious he will ring up on the telephone;&rdquo; and he pointed
    to the apparatus which stood on the library table in the centre of the room.</p>
  <p>After that he closed the door, and I was left to imagine the moments of
    joy, mingled with acute anguish, which my dear lady would be living through.</p>
  <p>I walked up and down restlessly on the terrace which fronts the Castle.
    The house itself appeared silent and dark: I presume all the servants had
    gone to bed. Far away on my right I caught the glimmer of a light. It came
    from the lodge where Felkin was watching. From the church in Appledore village
    came the sound of the clock striking the hour of midnight.</p>
  <p>How long I had been on the watch I cannot say, when suddenly I was aware
    of a man&rsquo;s figure running rapidly along the drive towards the house.
    The next moment the figure had skirted the Castle, apparently making for
    one of the back doors.</p>
  <p>I did not hesitate a moment. Having left the big front door on the latch,
    I ran straight in and made for the library door.</p>
  <p>Already Mr. Philip Baddock had forestalled me. His hand was on the latch.
    Without more ado he pushed open the door and I followed him in.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly was sitting on the sofa, with Captain Hubert beside her. They
    both rose at our entrance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; said Mr. Baddock, speaking very rapidly. &ldquo;Felkin
    has just run up from the lodge. He is getting the car ready. Pray God we
    may yet be able to get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke the front door bell sounded with a loud clang, which to
    me had the sound of a death knell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is too late, you see,&rdquo; said my dear lady, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not too late,&rdquo; ejaculated Philip Baddock, in a rapid whisper.  &ldquo;Quick!
    De Mazareen, follow me through the hall. Felkin is at the stables getting
    the car ready. It will be some time before the servants are roused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, I am sure, has failed to fasten the front door,&rdquo; interrupted
    Lady Molly, with the same strange calm. &ldquo;I think the police are already
    in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no mistaking the muffled sound of feet treading the thick Turkey
    carpet in the hall. The library had but one exit. Captain Hubert was literally
    in a trap. But Mr. Baddock had not lost his presence of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police would never dream of searching my house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they
    will take my word that De Mazareen is not here. Here!&rdquo; he added, pointing
    to a tall Jacobean wardrobe which stood in an angle of the room. &ldquo;In
    there, man, and leave the rest to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that such a proceeding would bring useless trouble upon
    you, Mr. Baddock,&rdquo; once more interposed Lady Molly; &ldquo;the police,
    if they do not at once find Captain de Mazareen, will surely search the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible! They would not dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed they would. The police know that Captain de Mazareen is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear they do not,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Baddock. &ldquo;Felkin is
    no traitor, and no one else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was I who gave information to the police,&rdquo; said Lady Molly,
    speaking loudly and clearly. &ldquo;I called up the superintendent on the
    telephone just now, and told him that his men would find the escaped convict
    hiding at Appledore Castle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Baddock, in a tone of surprise and horror,
    not unmixed with a certain note of triumph. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she replied calmly. &ldquo;I am of the police, you know.
    I had to do my duty. Open the door, Mary,&rdquo; she added, turning to me.</p>
  <p>Captain Hubert had not spoken a word so far. Now, when the men, led by Detective-Inspector
    Etty, entered the room, he walked with a firm step towards them, held out
    his hands for the irons, and with a final look at Lady Molly, in which love,
    trust, and hope were clearly expressed, he passed out of the room and was
    soon lost to sight.</p>
  <p>My dear lady waited until the heavy footfalls had died away; then she turned
    with a pleasant smile to Mr. Philip Baddock:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you for your kind thoughts of me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
    for your noble efforts on behalf of your nephew. My position was a difficult
    one. I hope you will forgive the pain I have been obliged to bring upon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do more than forgive, Lady Molly,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I
    will venture to hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took her hand and kissed it. Then she beckoned to me and I followed her
    into the hall.</p>
  <p>Our brougham&mdash;a hired one&mdash;had been waiting in the stable-yard.
    We drove home in silence; but half an hour later, when my dear lady kissed
    me good night she whispered in my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, Mary, we&rsquo;ll prove him innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheEnd"></a>The End</b></h2>
  <p>One or two people knew that at one time Lady Molly Robertson-Kirk had been
    engaged to Captain Hubert de Mazareen, who was now convict No. 97, undergoing
    a life sentence for the murder of Mr. Steadman, a solicitor of Carlisle,
    in the Elkhorn woods in April, 1904. Few, on the other hand, knew of the
    secret marriage solemnised on that never-to-be-forgotten afternoon, when
    all of us present in the church, with the exception of the bridegroom himself,
    were fully aware that proofs of guilt&mdash;deadly and irrefutable&mdash;were
    even then being heaped up against the man to whom Lady Molly was plighting
    her troth, for better or for worse, with her mental eyes wide open, her unerring
    intuition keen to the fact that nothing but a miracle could save the man
    she loved from an ignoble condemnation, perhaps from the gallows.</p>
  <p>The husband of my dear lady, the man whom she loved with all the strength
    of her romantic and passionate nature, was duly tried and convicted of murder.
    Condemned to be hanged, he was reprieved, and his sentence commuted to penal
    servitude for life.</p>
  <p>The question of Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s estate became a complicated one, for
    his last will and testament was never signed, and the former one, dated 1902,
    bequeathed everything he possessed unconditionally to his beloved grandson
    Hubert.</p>
  <p>After much legal argument, which it is useless to recapitulate here, it
    was agreed between the parties, and ratified in court, that the deceased
    gentleman&rsquo;s vast wealth should be disposed of as if he had died intestate.
    One half of it, therefore, went to Captain Hubert de Mazareen, grandson,
    and the other half to Philip Baddock, the son. The latter bought Appledore
    Castle and resided there, whilst his nephew became No. 97 in Dartmoor Prison.</p>
  <p>Captain Hubert had served two years of his sentence when he made that daring
    and successful escape which caused so much sensation at the time. He managed
    to reach Appledore, where he was discovered by Mr. Philip Baddock, who gave
    him food and shelter and got everything ready for the safe conveyance of
    his unfortunate nephew to Liverpool and thence to a port of safety in South
    America.</p>
  <p>You remember how he was thwarted in this laudable attempt by Lady Molly
    herself, who communicated with the police and gave up convict No. 97 into
    the hands of the authorities once more.</p>
  <p>Of course, public outcry was loud against my dear lady&rsquo;s action. Sense
    of duty was all very well, so people argued, but no one could forget that
    at one time Captain Hubert de Mazareen and Lady Molly Robertson-Kirk had
    actually been engaged to be married, and it seemed positively monstrous for
    a woman to be so pitiless towards the man whom she must at one time have
    loved.</p>
  <p>You see how little people understood my dear lady&rsquo;s motives. Some
    went so far as to say that she had only contemplated marriage with Captain
    Hubert de Mazareen because he was then, presumably, the heir to Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s
    fortune; now&mdash;continued the gossips&mdash;she was equally ready to marry
    Mr. Philip Baddock, who at any rate was the happy possessor of one half of
    the deceased gentleman&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
  <p>Certainly Lady Molly&rsquo;s conduct at this time helped to foster this
    idea. Finding that even the chief was inclined to give her the cold shoulder,
    she shut up our flat in Maida Vale and took up her residence at the little
    house which she owned in Kirk, and from the windows of which she had a splendid
    view of stately Appledore Castle nestling among the trees on the hillside.</p>
  <p>I was with her, of course, and Mr. Philip Baddock was a frequent visitor
    at the house. There could be no doubt that he admired her greatly, and that
    she accepted his attentions with a fair amount of graciousness. The county
    fought shy of her. Her former engagement to Captain de Mazareen was well
    known, and her treachery to him&mdash;so it was called&mdash;was severely
    censured.</p>
  <p>Living almost in isolation m the village, her whole soul seemed wrapped
    in thoughts of how to unravel the mystery of the death of Mr. Steadman. Captain
    de Mazareen had sworn in his defence that the solicitor, after starting to
    walk through the Elkhorn woods with him, had feared that the tramp over rough
    ground would be too much for him, and had almost immediately turned back
    in order to regain the road. But the chauffeur, George Taylor, who was busy
    with the broken-down car some two hundred yards up the road, never saw Mr.
    Steadman again, whilst Captain de Mazareen arrived at the gates of Appledore
    Castle alone. Here he was met by Mr. Philip Baddock, who informed him that
    Sir Jeremiah had breathed his last an hour before.</p>
  <p>No one at the Castle recollected seeing a stick in Captain Hubert&rsquo;s
    hand when he arrived, whilst there were several witnesses who swore that
    he carried one at Appledore Station when he started to walk with her ladyship.
    The stick was found close to the body of the solicitor; and the solicitor,
    when he met with his terrible death, had in his pocket the draft of a will
    which meant disinheritance to Captain de Mazareen.</p>
  <p>Here was the awful problem which Lady Molly had to face and to solve if
    she persisted in believing that the man whom she loved, and whom she had
    married at the moment when she knew that proofs of guilt were dead against
    him, was indeed innocent.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>We had spent all the morning shopping in Carlisle, and in the afternoon
    we called on Mr. Fuelling, of the firm of Fuelling, Steadman and Co., solicitors.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly had some business to arrange in connection with the purchase
    of an additional bit of land to round off her little garden at Kirk.</p>
  <p>Mr. Fuelling was courteous, but distinctly stiff, in his manner towards
    the lady who was &ldquo;connected with the police,&rdquo; more especially
    when&mdash;her business being transacted&mdash;she seemed inclined to tarry
    for a little while in the busy solicitor&rsquo;s office, and to lead conversation
    round to the subject of the murder of Mr. Steadman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five years have gone by since then,&rdquo; said Mr. Fuelling, curtly,
    in response to a remark from Lady Molly. &ldquo;I prefer not to revive unpleasant
    memories.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, of course, believed Captain de Mazareen guilty?&rdquo; retorted
    my dear lady, imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There were circumstances&mdash;&rdquo; rejoined the solicitor, &ldquo;and&mdash;and,
    of course, I hardly knew the unfortunate young man. Messrs. Truscott and
    Truscott used to be the family solicitors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It seemed curious that when Sir Jeremiah wished to make his
    will he should have sent for you, rather than for his accustomed lawyer,&rdquo; mused
    Lady Molly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Jeremiah did not send for me,&rdquo; replied Mr. Fuelling, with
    some acerbity, &ldquo;he sent for my junior, Mr. Steadman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Steadman was a personal friend of his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all. Not at all. Mr. Steadman was a new arrival in Carlisle,
    and had never seen Sir Jeremiah before the day when he was sent for and,
    in a brief interview, drafted the will which, alas! proved to be the primary
    cause of my unfortunate young partner&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot draft a will in a brief interview, Mr. Fuelling,&rdquo; remarked
    Lady Molly, lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Steadman did so,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Fuelling, curtly. &ldquo;Though
    Sir Jeremiah&rsquo;s mind was as clear as crystal, he was very feeble, and
    the interview had to take place in a darkened room. That was the only time
    my young partner saw Sir Jeremiah. Twenty-four hours later they were both
    dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; commented my dear lady with sudden indifference. &ldquo;Well!
    I won&rsquo;t detain you, Mr. Fuelling. Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few moments later, having parted from the worthy old solicitor, we were
    out in the street once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The darkened room is my first ray of light,&rdquo; quoth Lady Molly
    to me, with a smile at her own paradoxical remark.</p>
  <p>When we reached home later that afternoon we were met at the garden gate
    by Mr. Felkin, Mr. Philip Baddock&rsquo;s friend and agent, who lived with
    him at Appledore Castle.</p>
  <p>Mr. Felkin was a curious personality; very taciturn in manner but a man
    of considerable education. He was the son of a country parson, and at the
    time of his father&rsquo;s death he had been studying for the medical profession.
    Finding himself unable to pursue his studies for lack of means, and being
    left entirely destitute, he had been forced to earn his living by taking
    up the less exalted calling of male nurse. It seems that he had met Mr. Philip
    Baddock on the Continent some years ago, and the two young men had somehow
    drifted into close acquaintanceship. When the late Sir Jeremiah required
    a personal nurse-attendant Mr. Philip Baddock sent for his friend and installed
    him at Appledore Castle.</p>
  <p>Here Mr. Felkin remained, even after the old gentleman&rsquo;s death. He
    was nominally called Mr. Baddock&rsquo;s agent, but really did very little
    work. He was very fond of shooting and of riding, and spent his life in the
    pursuit of these sports, and he always had plenty of money to spend.</p>
  <p>But everyone voted him a disagreeable bear, and the only one who ever succeeded
    in making him smile was Lady Molly, who always showed an unaccountable liking
    for the uncouth creature. Even now, when he extended a somewhat grimy hand
    and murmured a clumsy apology at his intrusion, she greeted him with warm
    effusiveness and insisted on his coming into the house.</p>
  <p>We all turned to walk along the little drive, when Mr. Baddock&rsquo;s car
    came whizzing round the corner of the road from the Village. He pulled up
    at our gate, and the next moment had joined us in the drive.</p>
  <p>There was a very black look in his eyes, as they wandered restlessly from
    my dear lady&rsquo;s face to that of his friend. Lady Molly&rsquo;s little
    hand was even then resting on Mr. Felkin&rsquo;s coat-sleeve; she had been
    in the act of leading him herself towards the house, and did not withdraw
    her hand when Mr. Baddock appeared upon the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burton has just called about those estimates, Felkin,&rdquo; said
    the latter, somewhat roughly; &ldquo;he is waiting at the Castle. You had
    better take the car&mdash;l can walk home later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! how disappointing!&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Molly, with what looked
    uncommonly like a pout. &ldquo;I was going to have such a cosy chat with
    Mr. Felkin&mdash;all about horses and dogs. Couldn&rsquo;t you see that tiresome
    Burton, Mr. Baddock?&rdquo; she added ingenuously.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think that Mr. Baddock actually swore, but I am sure he was
    very near doing so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burton can wait,&rdquo; said Mr. Felkin, curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he cannot,&rdquo; retorted Philip Baddock, whose face was a frowning
    mirror of uncontrolled jealousy; &ldquo;take the car, Felkin, and go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment it seemed as if Felkin would refuse to obey. The two men stood
    looking at each other, measuring one another&rsquo;s power of will and strength
    of passion. Hate and jealousy were clearly written in each pair of glowering
    eyes. Philip Baddock looked defiant, and Felkin taciturn and sulky.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page304.jpg" width="535" height="750"></p>
  <p>Close to them stood my dear lady. Her beautiful eyes literally glowed with
    triumph. That these two men loved her, each in his own curious, uncontrolled
    way, I, her friend and confidant, knew very well. I had seen, and often puzzled
    over, the feminine attacks which she had made on the susceptibilities of
    that morose lout Felkin. It had taken her nearly two years to bring him to
    her feet. During that time she had alternately rendered him happy with her
    smiles and half mad with her coquetries, whilst Philip Baddock&rsquo;s love
    for her was perpetually fanned by his ever-growing jealousy.</p>
  <p>I remember that I often thought her game a cruel one. She was one of those
    women whom few men could resist; if she really desired to conquer she invariably
    succeeded, and her victory over Felkin seemed to me as purposeless as it
    was unkind. After all, she was the lawful wife of Captain de Mazareen, and
    to rouse hatred between two friends for the sake of her love, when that love
    was not hers to give, seemed unworthy of her. At this moment, when I could
    read deadly hatred in the faces of these two men, her cooing laugh grated
    unpleasantly on my ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mr. Felkin,&rdquo; she said, turning her luminous eyes
    on him.  &ldquo;Since you have so hard a taskmaster, you must do your duty
    now. But,&rdquo; she added, throwing a strange, defiant look at Mr. Baddock, &ldquo;I
    shall be at home this evening; come and have our cosy chat after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave him her hand, and he took it with a certain clumsy gallantry and
    raised it to his lips. I thought that Philip Baddock would strike his friend
    with his open hand. The veins on his temples were swollen like dark cords,
    and I don&rsquo;t think that I ever saw such an evil look in anyone&rsquo;s
    eyes before.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, the moment Mr. Felkin&rsquo;s back was turned my dear
    lady seemed to set herself the task of soothing the violent passions which
    she had wilfully aroused in the other man. She invited him to come into the
    house, and, some ten minutes later, I heard her singing to him. When, later
    on, I went into the boudoir to join them at tea, she was sitting on the music
    stool whilst he half bent over her, half knelt at her feet; her hands were
    clasped in her lap, and his fingers were closed over hers.</p>
  <p>He did not attempt to leave her side when he saw me entering the room. In
    fact, he wore a triumphant air of possession, and paid her those little attentions
    which only an accepted lover would dare to offer.</p>
  <p>He left soon after tea, and she accompanied him to the door. She gave him
    her hand to kiss, and I, who stood at some little distance in the shadow,
    thought that he would take her in his arms, so yielding and gracious did
    she seem. But some look or gesture on her part must have checked him, for
    he turned and walked quickly down the drive.</p>
  <p>Lady Molly stood in the doorway gazing out towards the sunset. I, in my
    humble mind, wondered once again what was the purport of this cruel game.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Half an hour later she called to me, asked for her hat, told me to put on
    mine and to come out for a stroll.</p>
  <p>As so often happened, she led the way towards the Elkhorn woods, which in
    spite, or perhaps because, of the painful memories they evoked, was a very
    favourite walk of hers.</p>
  <p>As a rule the wood, especially that portion of it where the unfortunate
    solicitor had been murdered, was deserted after sunset. The villagers declared
    that Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s ghost haunted the clearing, and that the cry of
    the murdered man, as he was being foully struck from behind, could be distinctly
    heard echoing through the trees.</p>
  <p>Needless to say, these superstitious fancies never disturbed Lady Molly.
    She liked to wander over the ground where was committed that mysterious crime
    which had sent to ignominy worse than death the man she loved so passionately.
    It seemed as if she meant to wrench its secret from the silent ground, from
    the leafy undergrowth, from the furtive inhabitants of the glades.</p>
  <p>The sun had gone down behind the hills; the wood was dark and still. We
    strolled up as far as the first clearing, where a plain, granite stone, put
    up by Mr. Philip Baddock, marked the spot where Mr. Steadman had been murdered.</p>
  <p>We sat down on it to rest. My dear lady&rsquo;s mood was a silent one; I
    did not dare to disturb it, and, for a while, only the gentle &ldquo;hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&rdquo; of
    the leaves, stirred by the evening breeze, broke the peaceful stillness of
    the glade.</p>
  <p>Then we heard a murmur of voices, deep-toned and low. We could not hear
    the words spoken, though we both strained our ears, and presently Lady Molly
    arose and cautiously made her way among the trees in the direction whence
    the voices came, I following as closely as I could.</p>
  <p>We had not gone far when we recognised the voices, and heard the words that
    were said. I paused, distinctly frightened, whilst my dear lady whispered
    a warning &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Never in all my life had I heard so much hatred, such vengeful malignity
    expressed in the intonation of the human voice as I did in the half-dozen
    words which now struck my ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will give her up, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Mr. Felkin who spoke. I recognised his raucous delivery, but I could
    not distinguish either of the two men in the gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; queried the other, in a voice which trembled with
    either rage or fear&mdash;perhaps with both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will give her up,&rdquo; repeated Felkin, sullenly. &ldquo;I
    tell you that it is an impossibility&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;an impossibility
    for me to stand by and see her wedded to you, or to any other man for the
    matter of that. But that is neither here nor there,&rdquo; he added after
    a slight pause. &ldquo;It is with you I have to deal now. You shan&rsquo;t
    have her&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t allow it, even if I have
    to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused again. I cannot describe the extraordinary effect this rough voice
    coming out of the darkness had upon my nerves. I had edged up to Lady Molly,
    and had succeeded in getting hold of her hand. It was like ice, and she herself
    was as rigid as that piece of granite on which we had been sitting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem bubbling over with covert threats,&rdquo; interposed Philip
    Baddock, with what was obviously a sneer; &ldquo;what are the extreme measures
    to which you will resort if I do not give up the lady whom I love with my
    whole heart, and who has honoured me to-day by accepting my hand in marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo; ejaculated Felkin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is a lie?&rdquo; queried the other, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has not accepted you&mdash;and you know it. You are trying to
    keep me away from her&mdash;arrogating rights which you do not possess. Give
    her up, man, give her up. It will be best for you. She will listen to me&mdash;I
    can win her all right&mdash;but you must stand aside for me this time. Take
    the word of a desperate man for it, Baddock. It will be best for you to give
    her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence reigned in the wood for a few moments, and then we heard Philip
    Baddock&rsquo;s voice again, but he seemed to speak more calmly, almost indifferently,
    as I thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going now?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in
    to dinner? &lsquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Felkin, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner,
    and I have an appointment for afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us part ill friends, Felkin,&rdquo; continued Philip
    Baddock in conciliatory tones. &ldquo;Do you know that, personally, my feeling
    is that no woman on earth is worth a serious quarrel between two old friends,
    such as we have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; rejoined the other drily. &ldquo;S&rsquo;long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cracking of twigs on the moss-covered ground indicated that the two
    men had parted and were going their several ways.</p>
  <p>With infinite caution, and holding my hand tightly in hers, my dear lady
    made her way along the narrow path which led us out of the wood.</p>
  <p>Once in the road we walked rapidly, and soon reached our garden gate. Lady
    Molly had not spoken a word during all that time, and no one knew better
    than I did how to respect her silence.</p>
  <p>During dinner she tried to talk of indifferent subjects, and never once
    alluded to the two men whom she had thus wilfully pitted one against the
    other. That her calm was only on the surface, however, I realised from the
    fact that every sound on the gravel path outside caused her to start. She
    was, of course, expecting the visit of Mr. Felkin.</p>
  <p>At eight o&rsquo;clock he came. It was obvious that he had spent the past
    hour in wandering about in the woods. He looked untidy and unkempt. My dear
    lady greeted him very coldly, and when he tried to kiss her hand she withdrew
    it abruptly.</p>
  <p>Our drawing-room was a double one, divided by <i>porti&egrave;re</i> curtains.
    Lady Molly led the way into the front room, followed by Mr. Felkin. Then
    she drew the curtains together, leaving me standing behind them. I concluded
    that she wished me to stay there and to listen, conscious of the fact that
    Felkin, in the agitated mood in which he was, would be quite oblivious of
    my presence.</p>
  <p>I almost pitied the poor man, for to me&mdash;the listener&mdash;it was
    at once apparent that my dear lady had only bidden him come to-night in order
    to torture him. For about a year she had been playing with him as a cat does
    with a mouse; encouraging him at times with sweet words and smiles, repelling
    him at others with coldness not unmixed with coquetry. But to-night her coldness
    was unalloyed; her voice was trenchant, her attitude almost one of contempt.</p>
  <p>I missed the beginning of their conversation, for the curtains were thick
    and I did not like to go too near, but soon Mr. Felkin&rsquo;s voice was
    raised. It was harsh and uncompromising.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that I am only good enough for a summer&rsquo;s flirtation?&rdquo; he
    said sullenly, &ldquo;but not to marry, eh? The owner of Appledore Castle,
    the millionaire, Mr. Baddock, is more in your line&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It certainly would be a more suitable match for me,&rdquo; rejoined
    Lady Molly, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He told me you had formally accepted him,&rdquo; said the man, with
    enforced calm; &ldquo;is that true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t marry him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The exclamation seemed to come straight from a heart brimful of passion,
    of love, of hate, and of revenge. The voice had the same intonation in it
    which had rung an hour ago in the dark Elkhorn woods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may do,&rdquo; came in quiet accents from my dear lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t marry him,&rdquo; repeated Felkin, roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who shall prevent me?&rdquo; retorted Lady Molly, with a low, sarcastic
    laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; she said contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told him an hour ago that he must give you up. I tell you now that
    you shall not be Philip Baddock&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she interposed. And I could almost see the disdainful
    shrug of her shoulders, the flash of contempt in her expressive eyes.</p>
  <p>No doubt it maddened him to see her so cool, so indifferent, when he had
    thought that he could win her. I do believe that the poor wretch loved her.
    She was always beautiful, but never more so than to-night when she had obviously
    determined finally to dismiss him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you marry Philip Baddock,&rdquo; he now said, in a voice which
    quivered with uncontrolled passion, &ldquo;then within six months of your
    wedding-day you will be a widow, for your husband will have ended his life
    on the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; she retorted calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is as it may be,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I warned him to-night,
    and he seems inclined to heed my warning; but he won&rsquo;t stand aside
    if you beckon to him. Therefore, if you love him, take my warning. I may
    not be able to get you, but I swear to you that Philip Baddock shan&rsquo;t
    either. I&rsquo;ll see him hanged first,&rdquo; he added, with gruesome significance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you think that you can force me to do your bidding by such paltry
    threats?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paltry threats? Ask Philip Baddock if my threats are paltry. He knows
    full well that in my room at Appledore Castle, safe from thievish fingers,
    lie the proofs that he killed Alexander Steadman in the Elkhorn woods. Oh!
    I wouldn&rsquo;t help him in his nefarious deeds until he placed himself
    in my hands. He had to take my terms or leave the thing alone altogether,
    for he could not work without me. My wants are few, and he has treated and
    paid me well. Now we are rivals, and I&rsquo;ll destroy him before I&rsquo;ll
    let him gloat over me.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="0602751h-images/page322.jpg" width="541" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know how we worked it? Sir Jeremiah would not disinherit his
    grandson&mdash;he steadily refused to make a will in Philip Baddock&rsquo;s
    favour. But when he was practically dying we sent for Alexander Steadman&mdash;a
    newcomer, who had never seen Sir Jeremiah before&mdash;and I impersonated
    the old gentleman for the occasion. Yes, I!&rdquo; he repeated with a coarse
    laugh, &ldquo;I was Sir Jeremiah for the space of half an hour, and I think
    that I played the part splendidly. I dictated the terms of a new will. Young
    Steadman never suspected the fraud for a single instant. We had darkened
    the room for the comedy, you see, and Mr. Steadman was destined by Baddock
    and myself never to set eyes on the real Sir Jeremiah.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the interview Baddock sent for Captain de Mazareen; this was
    all part of his plan and mine. We engineered it all, and we knew that Sir
    Jeremiah could only last a few hours. We sent for Steadman again, and I myself
    scattered a few dozen sharp nails among the loose stones in the road where
    the motorcar was intended to break down, thus forcing the solicitor to walk
    through the woods. Captain de Mazareen&rsquo;s appearance on the scene at
    that particular moment was an unrehearsed effect which nearly upset all our
    plans, for had Mr. Steadman stuck to him that night, instead of turning back,
    he would probably be alive now, and Baddock and I would be doing time somewhere
    for attempted fraud. We should have been done, at any rate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! you know what happened. Mr. Steadman was killed. Baddock killed
    him, and then ran straight back to the house, just in time to greet Captain
    de Mazareen, who evidently had loitered on his way. But it was I who thought
    of the stick, as an additional precaution to avert suspicion from ourselves.
    Captain de Mazareen was carrying one, and left it in the hall at the Castle.
    I cut my own hand and stained the stick with it, then polished and cleaned
    it up, and later, during the night, deposited it in the near neighbourhood
    of the murdered body. Ingenious, wasn&rsquo;t it? I am a clever beggar, you
    see. Because I was cleverer than Baddock he could not do without me, and
    because he could not do without me I made him write and sign a request to
    me to help him to manufacture a bogus will and then to murder the solicitor
    who had drawn it up. And I have hidden that precious document in the wing
    of Appledore Castle which I inhabit; the exact spot is known only to myself.
    Baddock has often tried to find out, but all he knows is that these things
    are in that particular wing of the house. I have the document, and the draft
    of the will taken out of Mr. Steadman&rsquo;s pocket, and the short bludgeon
    with which he was killed&mdash;it is still stained with blood&mdash;and the
    rags with which I cleaned the stick. I swear that I will never make use of
    these things against Philip Baddock unless he drives me to it, and if you
    make use of what I have just told you I&rsquo;ll swear that I have lied.
    No one can find the proofs which I hold. But on the day that you marry Baddock
    I&rsquo;ll place them in the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the room. I could almost hear the beating of my own
    heart, so horrified, so appalled was I at the horrible tale which the man
    had just told to my dear lady.</p>
  <p>The villainy of the whole scheme was so terrible, and at the same time so
    cunning, that it seemed inconceivable that human brain could have engendered
    it. Vaguely in my dull mind I wondered if Lady Molly would have to commit
    bigamy before she could wrench from this evildoer&rsquo;s hands the proofs
    that would set her own husband free from his martyrdom.</p>
  <p>What she said I did not hear, what he meant to retort I never knew, for
    at that moment my attention was attracted by the sound of running footsteps
    on the gravel, followed by a loud knock at our front door. Instinctively
    I ran to open it. Our old gardener was standing there hatless and breathless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Appledore Castle, miss,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s on
    fire. I thought you would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before I had time to reply I heard a loud oath uttered close behind me,
    and the next moment Felkin dashed out of the drawing-room into the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there a bicycle here that I can take?&rdquo; he shouted to the
    gardener.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;my son has one. Just
    in that shed, sir, on your left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In fewer seconds than it takes to relate, Felkin had rushed to the shed,
    dragged out the bicycle, mounted it, and I think that within two minutes
    of hearing the awful news, he was bowling along the road, and was soon out
    of sight.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>One wing of the stately mansion was ablaze when, a quarter of an hour later,
    my dear lady and I arrived upon the scene. We had come on our bicycles not
    long after Mr. Felkin.</p>
  <p>At the very moment that the weird spectacle burst fully upon our gaze, a
    loud cry of horror had just risen from the hundred or so people who stood
    watching the terrible conflagration, whilst the local fire brigade, assisted
    by Mr. Baddock&rsquo;s men, were working with the hydrants. That cry found
    echo in our own throats as we saw a man clambering, with the rapidity of
    a monkey, up a long ladder which had been propped up against a second floor
    window of the flaming portion of the building. The red glow illumined the
    large, shaggy head of Felkin, throwing for a moment into bold relief his
    hooked nose and straggly beard. For the space of three seconds perhaps he
    stood thus, outlined against what looked like a glowing furnace behind him,
    and the next instant he had disappeared beyond the window embrasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is madness!&rdquo; came in loud accents from out the crowd in
    the foreground, and before one fully realised whence that voice had come,
    Mr. Philip Baddock was in his turn seen clambering up that awful ladder.
    A dozen pairs of hands reached him just in time to drag him back from the
    perilous ascent. He fought to free himself, but the firemen were determined
    and soon succeeded in bringing him back to level ground, whilst two of them,
    helmeted and well-equipped, took his place upon the ladder.</p>
  <p>The foremost had hardly reached the level of the first story when Felkin&rsquo;s
    figure once more appeared in the window embrasure above. He was staggering
    like a man drunk or fainting, his shaggy hair and beard were blown about
    his head by the terrible draught caused by the flames, and he waved his arms
    over his head, giving the impression to those below, who gazed horrified,
    that he was either possessed or dying. In one hand he held what looked like
    a great, long bundle.</p>
  <p>We could see him now put one leg forward, obviously gathering strength to
    climb the somewhat high window ledge. With a shout of encouragement the two
    firemen scrambled up with squirrel-like agility, and the cry of &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
    coming! they&rsquo;re coming! Hold on, Felkin!&rdquo; rose from a hundred
    excited throats.</p>
  <p>The unfortunate man made another effort. We could see his face clearly now
    in the almost blinding glow which surrounded him. It was distorted with fear
    and also with agony.</p>
  <p>He gave one raucous cry, which I do believe will echo in my ears as long
    as I live, and with a superhuman effort he hurled the bundle which he held
    out of the window.</p>
  <p>At that same moment there was a terrific hissing, followed by a loud crash.
    The floor beneath the feet of the unfortunate man must have given way, for
    he disappeared suddenly in a sea of flames.</p>
  <p>The bundle which he had hurled down had struck the foremost fireman on the
    head. He lost his hold, and as he fell he dragged his unfortunate comrade
    down with him. The others ran to the rescue of their comrades. I don&rsquo;t
    think they were seriously hurt, but what happened directly after among the
    crowd, the firemen, or the burning building, I cannot tell you. I only know
    that at the moment when Felkin&rsquo;s figure was, for the second time, seen
    in the frame of the glowing window, Lady Molly seized my hand and dragged
    me forward through the crowd.</p>
  <p>Her husband&rsquo;s life was hanging in the balance, just as much as that
    of the miserable wretch who was courting a horrible death for the sake of
    those proofs which&mdash;as it was proved afterwards&mdash;Philip Baddock
    tried to destroy by such drastic means.</p>
  <p>The excitement round the ladder, the fall of the two firemen, the crashing
    in of the floor and the gruesome disappearance of Felkin caused so much excitement
    in the crowd that the bundle which the unfortunate man had thrown remained
    unheeded for the moment. But Philip Baddock reached the spot where it fell
    thirty seconds after Lady Molly did. She had already picked it up, when he
    said harshly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me that. It is mine. Felkin risked his life to save it for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inspector Etty, however, stood close by, and before Philip Baddock realised
    what Lady Molly meant to do, she had turned quickly and placed the bundle
    in the inspector&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know me, Etty, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my lady!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then take the utmost care of this bundle. It contains proofs of one
    of the most dastardly crimes ever committed in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No other words could have aroused the enthusiasm and caution of Etty in
    the same manner.</p>
  <p>After that Philip Baddock might protest, might rage, storm, or try to bribe,
    but the proofs of his guilt and Captain de Mazareen&rsquo;s innocence were
    safe in the hands of the police, and bound to come to light at last.</p>
  <p>But, as a matter of fact, Baddock neither stormed nor pleaded. When Lady
    Molly turned to him once more he had disappeared.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>You know the rest, of course. It occurred too recently to be recounted.
    Philip Baddock was found the next morning with a bullet through his head,
    lying on the granite stone which, with cruel hypocrisy, he himself had erected
    in memory of Mr. Steadman whom he had so foully murdered.</p>
  <p>The unfortunate Felkin had not lied when he said that the proofs which he
    held of Baddock&rsquo;s guilt were conclusive and deadly.</p>
  <p>Captain de Mazareen obtained His Majesty&rsquo;s gracious pardon after five
    years of martyrdom which he had borne with heroic fortitude.</p>
  <p>I was not present when Lady Molly was once more united to the man who so
    ardently worshipped and trusted her, and to whose love, innocence, and cause
    she had remained so sublimely loyal throughout the past few years.</p>
  <p>She has given up her connection with the police. The reason for it has gone
    with the return of her happiness, over which I&mdash;her ever faithful Mary
    Granard&mdash;will, with your permission, draw a veil.</p>
