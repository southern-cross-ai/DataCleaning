  <p class="cp"><i>"God counts a woman's tears."</i>&mdash;<span class=
  "smcap">The Talmud</span></p><br>

  <p class="first">I FIRST heard the name of Margaret Higgs one gloomy
  afternoon, when passing over the Chase by Tydenham, with Severn (they don't
  say "the" Severn there) trailing itself away through a vale of haze far down
  on my right. The aged clergyman I was making the journey with showed me the
  mass of rags and grey locks, where the woman sat alone on a rock on the
  Chase, saying to me&mdash;"Mark that woman, a remarkable being, I assure you,
  a woman who during sixteen years has plumbed even the deeps of human woe; for
  I say that if ever the arm of the Almighty bared itself to be known openly in
  the affairs of men, it was in that life. There, like a pine blighted by the
  lightning's wrath, sits Margaret now, a living pledge of that Power which
  governs the world."</p>

  <p>He spoke with no little solemnity, though I must say that when he went on
  to tell me the facts, he left me utterly unconvinced of this "arm of the
  Almighty"; and I hope that by this time he, too, has nobler thoughts with
  regard to Margaret Higgs.</p>

  <p>"I remember her when she had no resemblance to the object you see there,"
  he told me, "a shapely wench with a tripping run on her toes, soft-spoken and
  most soft-eyed, dark blue eyes and black hair, a gay
  gossip&mdash;'news-hunter' they say here&mdash;with a prayer-book in her hand
  in the lanes on Sunday, and a name for 'knocking around' with the young men;
  one of those earth-born souls of this part, unconscious of a world beyond
  Severn&mdash;save of Gloucester, because the magistrates say to the naughty
  ones: 'Go to Gloucester for a month.'</p>

  <p>"She came of good farmer-folk in a small way, who died almost together,
  upon which Margaret chose to marry beneath her, a quarry-man from the
  Wyebanks near, a thickset, rather taciturn and nervous person, named Higgs, a
  widower some fifteen years Margaret's senior. He had a son of twelve or so
  called Fred Higgs; and I think I have heard it said that as a girl Margaret
  had had the nursing of this boy, and that it was her fondness for the boy
  which caused the heiress to make choice of the father.</p>

  <p>"Well, Margaret and Higgs got on very well for several years. I have
  observed them driving toward St. Bride's of a week-end to market, frequently
  have called in to visit them, and they appeared happy. However, one summer
  there came to lodge with them a stranger&mdash;a sailor they say he was,
  though, as the house stands well out of the way in a bower, and as the
  stranger never at all showed his nose abroad, not much is known of him; one
  or two, however, of the Woolaston villagers lower down the mountain&mdash;a
  group of people known as the most 'news-hunting' in the country&mdash;gave it
  out that the stranger was a good-looking chap, and that Margaret had lost her
  heart to him; a tale which was confirmed when he was one afternoon loudly
  ordered out of the house by Higgs, and was observed to pass out of the house
  and away over the mountains.</p>

  <p>"Well, some time after nine that night, when the boy Fred Higgs went to
  bed, Margaret, from motives of revenge, probably, destroyed her husband; for
  from that night Higgs has never been seen, and a daft fellow called Felix,
  who would frequently roam the countryside all night, reported that near three
  that morning he had seen Mrs. Higgs struggling in a storm across the fields
  towards Severn beneath the burden of a body.</p>

  <p>"This was all the evidence to begin with, except the queer fact that
  Margaret breathed not a syllable to anyone with regard to her husband's
  disappearance; but other signs and evidences soon followed, as I have told
  you, from&mdash;Heaven itself."</p>

  <p>Owing, maybe, to the fact that this witness, Felix, was not a man able to
  appreciate the nature of an oath, the police took no open action in the
  matter; and at this apparent sluggishness of the law, you never saw such a
  gush of fury, every boatman for miles up the two rivers becoming an eye to
  scan the waters for a body; and both where the banks are all mud, and where
  there are reaches of beach, parties of diggers, organised by the villagers,
  were ferreting for a buried body.</p>

  <p>"Well, no body was ever discovered; but by society, I can tell you, a way
  was discovered to avenge itself, and the woman was punished. The baker's cart
  ceased to wait at Woodside farm, the butcher declined to deal; even so far
  off as St. Bride's and the Forest of Dean, Margaret Higgs could neither sell
  her starved calf nor get meal for her pig, nor find a forgiving smile."</p>

  <p>"Her's done away wi'n right enough," was the word everywhere: "hanging be
  too good for she, and shame ought to cover the face of the police." Passing
  by the farm one morning, I walked up the garden-path, and saw Margaret. The
  round of industry there was suspended now, her stepson appeared to be aiming
  shots at imaginary rabbits, and the young woman, swinging her knee between
  her hands, was seated on the door-sill of her snowy low home. She sprang up
  to offer me a chair, and I said then sorrowfully to her:</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Higgs, things are not so well with you as they have been," at
  which she at once became visibly inflamed, and cried out, "the gossiping,
  news-hunting lot, ignorant as wagon-horses!</p>

  <p>"I do have nothing off they, Mr. Somerset! They don't keep me! Why should
  I trouble about what they have to say?"</p>

  <p>"But how, Mrs. Higgs, do you propose to live, to manage the farm?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I did live and find bread for the boy before, and I'll do it again, sir,"
  she answered.</p>

  <p>"But for one to defy many is up-hill work, and you without a protector
  now," I said..."Tell me the truth, Margaret," I added, "is Higgs dead?"</p>

  <p>She stood against the wall, eyeing the ground, and after a silence said
  with a shrug of her shoulders: "'Er be dead, I suppose&mdash;God knows; I
  don't."</p>

  <p>Well, I was angry at this callous shrugging, and left her at once.</p>

  <p>The next Sunday she dared to come to church, and as I surmised that this
  would be resented, especially as she walked up the aisle with so haughty a
  toss of the head, I uttered in my sermon a few words as to the beauty of
  Christian forbearance. But it had no effect, and all up the back lane that
  leads steeply to Woodside, though it was a stormy afternoon, Margaret was
  followed by the congregation&mdash;most of them her cousins, and cousins of
  one another. They did not at first molest her, but tittered coughs, whistles,
  catcalls; all which she endured without looking round, till by becks and
  signs they managed to induce her boy to leave her side and join the enemy,
  and thenceforth the walk became a cross-fire of abuse yelled from side to
  side, the woman hastening on in front afraid, with a grey face, but defiant
  eyes on fire, the people eagerly speeding upon her heels with no peaceable
  meaning.</p>

  <p>"Go on!" she shouted to them, laughing with a rather ghastly grin of the
  mouth&mdash;"you gossiping, news-hunting lot! Shame ought to cover your
  face!"</p>

  <p>"Where's Higgs?" they all roared at her.</p>

  <p>"Go on, you! ignorant as wagon-horses, with your silly, foolhardy
  questions!" And so till they came to her house, where the crowd surrounded
  her; and now, finding herself at bay, her defiance suddenly failing, the
  woman broke into tears, and falling to her knees, called out upon the
  Almighty in passionate tones of reproach, saying "What have I done, my good
  God? If I have done any wrong, send that my house may be burnt to the ground,
  may every evil befall me, may I be struck paralysed from my crown to my
  foot&mdash;" a vow so apparently hearty, and so awful to the villagers that
  they went away and left her.</p>

  <p>But that night her house was burned to the ground.</p>

  <p>When the crowd had left her, she had flung herself upon a couch in the
  house, where she had remained in the grip of an ague till nine in the night;
  and getting up then to go to bed her still trembling hand had dropped the
  lamp....</p>

  <p>The news of that thing flew that night like loosened effluvia, and in a
  few minutes Woolaston was at Woodside. They found the boy, Fred Higgs,
  confined in the house by the fire, for in the first panic Margaret had run
  out, calling out to him, but he had been asleep, and now was screaming at his
  window, which was too little for him to squeeze through to leap to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, some of the crowd darted off to look for the orchard-ladder,
  when Margaret herself, to the awe of all, dived back into the fire, and
  presently appeared tearing at the framework of the boy's window, half of
  which was a fixture, and half a sideward slide. Well, as she as ever a person
  of great strength, the woodwork gave way to her tuggings, leaving space for
  the leap to the ground, and they came down safely.</p>

  <p>Fred Higgs was taken home by Price, the grocer; and Margaret, now all bald
  and baked on one side of the face, found a shelter in her stable with the
  body of her starved horse, which had died that day.</p>

  <p>But the woman's spirit was not yet broken. When, the next morning, Morgan,
  the policeman, called to invite her, things being as they were, to make a
  clean breast of what had happened to Higgs, she still sat dumb, rocking her
  body to and fro. She seems to have entertained still the crazy hope of
  carrying on the farm on which she was born, but that same day Mr. Millings,
  Loreburn's land-steward, called to tell her that, of course, she must go now,
  offering, however, to give her a price for her implements, etc., which no one
  else would buy of her. These terms she had to accept; but she showed then as
  ever a fierce determination not to leave the place of her birth, and like a
  spider whose web has been torn, at once the woman set mutely to work to build
  up her life anew.</p>

  <p>On the third day after the fire she came with her face in bandages to my
  daughter, Nina, who owned a cottage high up there near the Chase; and though
  I felt bound to warn my daughter of the danger of letting, she chose to do
  so. On this the woman went away to Newport, bought there some new things,
  took her sow and fowls to her new abode, and was about once more to commence
  housekeeping. But it was not to be: for when all was ready, and she went down
  to Price, the grocer, who had taken in her boy, the boy roundly refused to go
  with her, saying to her: 'No, mother, I don't want to see thee face never
  again.' These words seemed to strike the woman quite silly; and turning
  toward the crowd for pity, with a wry mouth that tried to smile, she let slip
  the words: "Why, it was for him chiefly I did it!" "Did it! You hear her? Did
  what?" cried some, while the rest of the boors booed and hissed her.</p>

  <p>"Come with your mother, hearty," wooed the woman to the boy, "don't be
  hard."</p>

  <p>"Thee go away," said the boy, emboldened by the mob, "thee bisn't my own
  mother, nor I never did despise anybody so much as I do despise thee, never
  in all my life, and shame ought to cover thee face." Margaret looked
  awe-struck at this last disaster. She said nothing more, but throwing her arm
  languidly at him was gone with lagging steps, as if broken down now, given
  over, cowed, and done for; nor from that day, I think, did she ever show any
  resistance to whatever was done to her, except once, when she threw a stone
  at a throng of boys who were pursuing her.</p>

  <p>Morgan, the policeman, however, and I also, thought that with regard to
  the boy, to whom from his youth the woman had ever been a good mother, a
  hardship had been done her; especially as without his help her new nook of
  land would be of little use to her. So after three weeks of talk the grocer
  formally agreed to give up the boy; and the same morning Morgan, happening to
  be passing up there, called to Margaret across her gate that her boy would be
  coming back to her at once. Upon this she seems to have run to stand under an
  ash tree at the end of the lane to see him coming up the hill; several
  persons, hurrying past in the rain, saw her standing there that day with her
  dress thrown over her head; and though the boy did not come for some hours,
  there she stood patiently on the look out, until the afternoon had become
  late and dark with storm. At last the boy came. But it was to find her lying
  helpless on her right side, apparently struck by lightning&mdash;the ash, at
  any rate, had been shivered, and she was found paralysed right down one side.
  Babbling with her blighted tongue, she begged the boy to give her a hand, to
  try to get her home without uttering a word to anyone, but he, as if out of
  his wits, flew down the hill, howling out the news to the four winds.</p>

  <p>Well, however deep the woman's sin, what followed for her that evening is
  really shocking to recount, for a legion of fiends seem to have taken
  possession of the people to make a scene out of pandemonium on the mountain
  that evening. The words arose, "drum her out"&mdash;for, of course, whatever
  doubt may have lingered in any mind with regard to Margaret's guilt was gone
  now, since all that her vow had called down upon herself was now fallen upon
  her; nor did the rain and darkness make any difference; with one accord the
  crowd started up the mountain. Happily, she guessed their approach, and in
  her terror, gathering whatever forces remained to her, she fled before them,
  managing to drag her frame into some bush before they reached the tree; while
  they, going on to her cottage to find her, and not finding her, threw all her
  new goods into a hurly-burly, and by accident or design burned to the ground
  my daughter's house. It was not till the next morning that Margaret was
  discovered lying in the field called the Morplepiece, and was then carried
  away by the police, to be put into the St. Bride's infirmary.</p>

  <p>There pressure was afresh brought to bear upon the woman to make some sort
  of confession, but she remained as dumb as ever; and after some months was
  sent out with that maimed drag in her gait and speech, which even now marks
  her. She dared again, though now penniless and hopeless of gaining a living
  here, to face the load of pain that awaited her in her native place; and
  hereabouts, Heaven knows how, has continued to exist. My daughter Nina, whose
  heart has always deeply grieved for her, sometimes of an angry night will say
  to me: "That poor Margaret Higgs, papa; perhaps out on the Chase in it all."
  Aye, and I have known her go out with a groom and a lantern to look for the
  woman, and on discovering her under one of those two-arched kilns which are
  common in this part, has wooed the poor soul to come home with her. Margaret
  when dragged has come, but always before morning was gone again. In deed, she
  had soon become much of a wild woman, imbued with the mood of storm-winds and
  dark nights, as shy and gloomy-eyed as those shaggy nags on the Chase, her
  only mates, whose manes and great tails the gales up there ever fret; so that
  belated yokels on their way home have often paused to hearken to some moan or
  laugh of hers in the dark. Once she was sent to prison, when, ever unlucky,
  on happening to throw a stone at a throng of boys, the stone cut one of them,
  and the magistrates gave her their "go to Gloucester for a month." One of
  these magistrates, by the way, was none other than her stepson, Fred Higgs,
  who had been taken up by some mysterious business man&mdash;in Glasgow they
  say it was&mdash;had graduated at Oxford, and is now, you may say, one of our
  magnates. The man has simply ignored his stepmother's existence.</p>

  <p>However, the new proprietor of Glanna has given orders that the woman be
  housed, and provided with the means of a livelihood&mdash;has let it be
  understood, too, that whoever injures her will incur his displeasure. In
  fact, during the few weeks that this Mr. Ogden has been in residence, his
  goodness to the poor has become the talk, though he seems something of a
  queer sort, and almost a hermit. At any rate, through him, the condition of
  Margaret may shortly be expected to undergo a change, though it is not easy
  to rescue her&mdash;she resists, appears to be suspicious, can't now believe
  perhaps that anyone really wishes her well&mdash;and whether she is capable
  of being reclaimed from her half-savage state it is hard to say: for the
  years alter us all, sir, the years leave the marks of their passing upon
  us.</p>

  <p>So much Mr. Somerset, the aged clergyman, was able to give me of the story
  of Margaret Higgs, and that morose star of hers; and two days later I learned
  in further detail that every effort was being made to tame and help her.</p>

  <p>But the bad destiny that seemed to have the woman in hand was not even yet
  done with her.</p>

  <p>Her new abode was actually ready for her, and she had agreed to go into
  it, glad, I suppose, poor soul, of a bed at last, when some men, digging for
  a foundation down by Severn, found the remains of a man.</p>

  <p>It was near the spot where the daft Felix over fifteen years before had
  seen Margaret Higgs with a body on her back one dark morning, and the cry
  arose, "the body of Higgs at last."</p>

  <p>Again, then, was Margaret taken to prison; and I, hearing of all the
  to-do, took train to St. Bride's to witness her trial in the petty sessions
  there.</p>

  <p>Of the two justices one was her own stepson, Fred Higgs, a good-looking
  man of not much more than thirty, and the other, the new lord of the Manor of
  Glanna.</p>

  <p>As to the woman herself, she sat through it all&mdash;she was too woefully
  weak to stand&mdash;in a spiritless attitude, as unmoving as a statue. It was
  understood that, on being pressed in prison, she had admitted that the body
  discovered was that of her husband, buried by her; to which admission one
  Inspector Jonas deposed, and spoke as to the enforcing of the Coroner's
  warrant, and the whole story of the horror.</p>

  <p>But what struck me from the first was the nervousness of one of the
  justices, the lord of Glanna&mdash;a short-built and broad-faced man, with
  cropped hair, and squat fingers, with which he kept tapping on his chin,
  tapping on his chair, tapping ever on everything near him.</p>

  <p>And presently his keenness to procure the release of the accused became
  quite clear, till it was painful. One never saw a judge so jumpy in his
  chair, so agitated, so impatient of opposition.</p>

  <p>When his brother justice once leaned toward him, perhaps to whisper some
  remonstrance, Mr. Ogden cried out loudly: "You be sure to shut your mouth!"
  and I then noticed that the very slight rocking of Margaret Higgs's body,
  which was going on as regularly as a pendulum's swing, suddenly ceased, and
  the woman seemed to start and hearken.</p>

  <p>Evidence, however, is evidence, and no magistrate could have saved the
  woman from the County assizes, had it not been that at the last, when the
  prosecution was summing-up, saying, "there can be no doubt therefore that the
  remains now found are actually those of Barnaby Higgs&mdash;" Mr. Ogden at
  those words leaped from his chair, calling out: "But how can all that be so
  certain to you, sir, when here's Barnaby Higgs himself, a living man, talking
  to ye?"</p>

  <p>The hand which the old man spread before us shivered with strong emotion,
  while tears blinded his eyes. I heard Mr. Somerset, seated near me on the
  bench, twice breathe to himself:</p>

  <p>"My God!" The mass of rags in the dock sprang straight with a crazy stare.
  Throughout the crowded room hardly a sound was heard till Mr. Higgs, stepping
  to the rail, spoke&mdash;with a most painful agitation at the beginning, but
  presently more calmly and then again with wrathful agitation when, turning
  upon Fred Higgs, he scourged his son with invective. And ever afresh at the
  object of sorrow and rags arraigned before him he stretched his forefinger,
  with red-veined eyes, and a moan of love in his choked throat, calling her
  blessed, calling her saint.</p>

  <p>It was the same Barnaby Higgs, he told the court&mdash;was rather
  surprised that some of them hadn't recognised him&mdash;only sixteen years
  older now, and a big-wig, in a frock-coat, and without a beard, but the
  same.</p>

  <p>One summer there had come to the farm a man named John Cheyne&mdash;a
  sailorman he was&mdash;a cousin, who had got into trouble for abducting a
  girl, and Higgs had hidden him.</p>

  <p>But the chap had not been three days on the place when Higgs began to be
  jealous.</p>

  <p>"Though she told me that there was nothing in it, I didn't believe her,
  nor I don't now believe her, for I distinctly saw John Cheyne kissing, or
  trying to kiss, her behind the sty; and that same day, between three-thirty
  and four by the clock, I turned the fellow off the place."</p>

  <p>The sailor took his departure, but by ten in the night was back at the
  farm, craving to be again taken in; this Higgs refused. Cheyne pushed himself
  in, hot words arose, then fisticuffs, during which Cheyne, who must have had
  heart-disease, "dropped down dead before a right-handed cross-counter in the
  left ribs, after a lead-off with the left by himself." Some moments
  afterwards, Margaret, who had been out "at fair," walked in and saw what that
  was which Higgs was crouched down over on the floor.</p>

  <p>Higgs, in the crowd of his terrors, knowing that his row with the sailor
  was known, could foresee nothing but the gallows; but Margaret, after sitting
  like a stone a long time, proposed flight, she to bury the body down by
  Severn, and in three nights' time to meet Higgs secretly on the Chase, to let
  him know whether he might safely return home.</p>

  <p>This was agreed. Higgs ran, Margaret buried the sailor&mdash;no one
  suspected that he was dead, but as to the rendezvous on the Chase on the
  third day Higgs, ever nervous, had shirked it.</p>

  <p>Terrified by the tidings heard in his hiding that Margaret had been seen
  carrying a body on her back, he had not dared to return into the region of
  danger, but, having reached Liverpool, took ship.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said from the bench, "I abandoned her, little thinking that
  she'd be seriously charged with killing me, who knew myself to be alive and
  hearty, and all the time I was in South Africa I was that shy and sick of my
  cowardice I couldn't write to her; I preferred she should think me dead and
  gone. But I didn't know, I made sure she'd be going on all right in the old
  style....</p>

  <p>"Hadn't I left one to protect her, friends? Didn't I get a business friend
  in Glasgow to adopt him? He did nothing for her. My own son&mdash;this
  man&mdash;he did nothing for her. Ah! the squalls that caught her and the
  frosts that froze her bones were never a bit so hard on her as this bitter
  heart.</p>

  <p>"It was for him she did it, friends, just think! She said to me that
  night, for she was cross wi' me, 'it's not to screen thee, I do it,' she
  said, 'so I tell thee straight; but what kind of a life will it be for Fred
  with everybody having it to say he be a murderer's son?' And she kept the
  truth dark from him and from all&mdash;how long? For two months? For ten?
  While he was a dutiful boy to her? No, sixteen solid years down to this hour,
  though he was a beast to her. Why, sirs, talking of Christianity, there
  stands a Christian for you, I think? And you&mdash;you, couldn't you do some
  little something for her who did so much for you? Were you really bound to
  send her to Gloucester? And when you saw that her own husband had coward-like
  abandoned her, and all the crowd of them was hounding her, and the Almighty
  God on high Himself that ought to have been her Father was all dead agen her,
  and she stood dumb and astonished, was that the moment for you, too, Fred,
  hard heart...? For if only from this confession she has made that she did
  kill me, I can pretty well judge what she's been through; she has confessed
  because, when she'd once tasted her prison cell that's proved a palace of
  rest to her after her kilns, and her brackens, and her barns, and her storms,
  she was afraid of being set free, maybe, if she didn't confess; or maybe she
  was too aweary to trouble to say no to aught they asked her. Oh, well, poor
  wounded woman, you've had it to do, haven't you, poor mute ewe, with all your
  wounds and bruises on you; but a bosom is here at last to guard you, Margaret
  Higgs, like the morning to a murky night, and the turning to a long lane,
  aye, a bosom is here to guard you...The prisoner is discharged!</p>

  <p>"Officer, I give myself in charge for the manslaughter of one John
  Cheyne."</p>

  <p>It was now that the woman, babbling something, put out both her hands one
  moment toward her husband, but in the very act failed and fell. She was
  raised and taken out, and I, rushing out with the rest just behind her
  husband, witnessed everything that was done in vain to revive her, and the
  raver's frenzied vain prayers to his dead.</p>
