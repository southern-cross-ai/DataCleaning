<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="first">I HAD been dining with my ever-interesting
friend, Mark Jenkins, at a little Italian restaurant near South
Street. It was a chance meeting. Jenkins is too busy, usually, to
make dinner engagements. Over our highly seasoned food and sour,
thin, red wine, he spoke of little odd incidents and adventures
of his profession. Nothing very vital or important, of course.
Jenkins is not the sort of detective who first detects and then
pours the egotistical and revealing details of achievement in the
ears of every acquaintance, however appreciative.</p>

<p>But when I spoke of something I had seen in the morning
papers, he laughed. "Poor old 'Doc' Holt! Fascinating old codger,
to anyone who really knows him. I've had his friendship for
years&mdash;since I was first on the city force and saved a young
assistant of his from jail on a false charge. And they had to
drag him into the poisoning of this young sport, Ralph
Peeler!"</p>

<p>"Why are you so sure he couldn't have been implicated?" I
asked.</p>

<p>But Jenkins only shook his head, with a quiet smile. "I have
reasons for believing otherwise," was all I could get out of him
on that score, "But," he added, "the only reason he was suspected
at all is the superstitious dread of these ignorant people around
him. Can't see why he lives in such a place. I know for a fact he
doesn't have to. Doc's got money of his own. He's an amateur
chemist and dabbler in different sorts of research work, and I
suspect he's been guilty of 'showing off.' Result, they all swear
he has the evil eye and holds forbidden communion with invisible
powers. Smoke?"</p>

<p>Jenkins offered me one of his invariably good cigars, which I
accepted, saying thoughtfully: "A man has no right to trifle with
the superstitions of ignorant people. Sooner or later, it spells
trouble."</p>

<p>"Did in his case. They swore up and down that he sold love
charms openly and poisons secretly, and that, together with his
living so near to&mdash;somebody else&mdash;got him temporarily
suspected. But my tongue's running away with me, as usual!"</p>

<p>"As usual," I retorted impatiently, "you open up with all the
frankness of a Chinese diplomat."</p>

<p>He beamed upon me engagingly and rose from the table, with a
glance at his watch. "Sorry to leave you, Blaisdell, but I have
to meet Jimmy Brennan in ten minutes."</p>

<p><br> HE so clearly did not invite my further company that I
remained seated for a little while after his departure; then took
my own way homeward. Those streets always held for me a certain
fascination, particularly at night. They are so unlike the rest
of the city, so foreign in appearance, with their little shabby
stores, always open until late evening, their unbelievably cheap
goods, displayed as much outside the shops as in them, hung on
the fronts and laid out on tables by the curb and in the street
itself. Tonight, however, neither people nor stores in any sense
appealed to me. The mixture of Italians, Jews and a few Negroes,
mostly bareheaded, unkempt and generally unhygienic in
appearance, struck me as merely revolting. They were all humans,
and I, too, was human. Some way I did not like the idea.</p>

<p>Puzzled a trifle, for I am more inclined to sympathize with
poverty than accuse it, I watched the faces that I passed. Never
before had I observed how bestial, how brutal were the
countenances of the dwellers in this region. I actually shuddered
when an old-clothes man, a gray-bearded Hebrew, brushed me as he
toiled past with his barrow.</p>

<p>There was a sense of evil in the air, a warning of things
which it is wise for a clean man to shun and keep clear of. The
impression became so strong that before I had walked two squares
I began to feel physically ill. Then it occurred to me that the
one glass of cheap Chianti I had drunk might have something to do
with the feeling. Who knew how that stuff had been manufactured,
or whether the juice of the grape entered at all into its ill-
flavored composition? Yet I doubted if that were the real cause
of my discomfort.</p>

<p>By nature I am rather a sensitive, impressionable sort of
chap. In some way tonight this neighborhood, with its sordid
sights and smells, had struck me wrong.</p>

<p>My sense of impending evil was merging into actual fear. This
would never do. There is only one way to deal with an imaginative
temperament like mine&mdash;conquer its vagaries. If I left South
Street with this nameless dread upon me, I could never pass down
it again without a recurrence of the feeling. I should simply
have to stay here until I got the better of it&mdash;that was
all.</p>

<p>I paused on a corner before a shabby but brightly lighted
little drug store. Its gleaming windows and the luminous green of
its conventional glass show jars made the brightest spot on the
block. I realized that I was tired, but hardly wanted to go in
there and rest. I knew what the company would be like at its
shabby, sticky soda fountain. As I stood there, my eyes fell on a
long white canvas sign across from me, and its black-and-red
lettering caught my attention.</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">
SEE THE GREAT UNSEEN!<br>
COME IN! THIS MEANS YOU!<br>
FREE TO ALL!</p>

<br>

<p>A museum of fakes, I thought, but also reflected that if it
were a show of some kind I could sit down for a while, rest, and
fight off this increasing obsession of nonexistent evil. That
side of the street was almost deserted, and the place itself
might well be nearly empty.</p>

<br>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="first">I WALKED over, but with every step my sense of
dread increased. Dread of I knew not what. Bodiless, inexplicable
horror had me as in a net, whose strands, being intangible,
without reason for existence, I could by no means throw off. It
was not the people now. None of them were about me. There, in the
open, lighted street, with no sight nor sound of terror to assail
me, I was the shivering victim of such fear as I had never known
was possible. Yet still I would not yield.</p>

<p>Setting my teeth, and fighting with myself as with some pet
animal gone mad, I forced my steps to slowness and walked along
the sidewalk, seeking entrance. Just here there were no shops,
but several doors reached in each case by means of a few iron-
railed stone steps. I chose the one in the middle beneath the
sign. In that neighborhood there are museums, shops and other
commercial enterprises conducted in many shabby old residences,
such as were these. Behind the glazing of the door I had chosen I
could see a dim, pinkish light, but on either side the windows
were quite dark.</p>

<p>Trying the door, I found it unlocked. As I opened it a party
of Italians passed on the pavement below and I looked back at
them over my shoulder. They were gayly dressed, men, women and
children, laughing and chattering to one another; probably on
their way to some wedding or other festivity.</p>

<p>In passing, one of the men glanced up at me and involuntarily
I shuddered back against the door. He was a young man, handsome
after the swarthy manner of his race, but never in my life had I
see a face so expressive of pure, malicious cruelty, naked and
unashamed. Our eyes met and his seemed to light up with a vile
gleaming, as if all the wickedness of his nature had come to a
focus in the look of concentrated hate he gave me.</p>

<p>They went by, but for some distance I could see him watching
me, chin on shoulder, till he and his party were swallowed up in
the crowd of marketers farther down the street.</p>

<p><br>
SICK and trembling from that encounter, merely of eyes
though it had been, I threw aside my partly smoked cigar and
entered. Within there was a small vestibule, whose ancient
tesselated floor was grimy with the passing of many feet. I could
feel the grit of dirt under my shoes, and it rasped on my rawly
quivering nerves. The inner door stood partly open, and going on
I found myself in a bare, dirty hallway, and was greeted by the
sour, musty, poverty-stricken smell common to dwellings of the
very ill-to-do. Beyond there was a stairway, carpeted with ragged
grass matting. A gas jet, turned low inside a very dusty pink
globe, was the light I had seen from without.</p>

<p>Listening, the house seemed entirely silent. Surely, this was
no place of public amusement of any kind whatever. More likely it
was a rooming house, and I had, after all, mistaken the
entrance.</p>

<p>To my intense relief, since coming inside, the worst agony of
my unreasonable terror had passed away. If I could only get in
some place where I could sit down and be quiet, probably I should
be rid of it for good. Determining to try another entrance, I was
about to leave the bare hallway when one of several doors along
the side of it suddenly opened and a man stepped out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, looking at me keenly, but with not the least
show of surprise at my presence.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I replied. "The door was unlocked and I
came in here, thinking it was the entrance to the
exhibit&mdash;what do they call it? the 'Great Unseen.' The one
that is mentioned on that long white sign. Can you tell me which
door is the right one?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>With that brief answer he stopped and stared at me again. He
was a tall, lean man, somewhat stooped, but possessing
considerable dignity of bearing. For that neighborhood, he
appeared uncommonly well dressed, and his long, smooth-shaven
face was noticeable because, while his complexion was dark and
his eyes coal-black, above them the heavy brows and his hair were
almost silvery-white. His age might have been anything over the
threescore mark.</p>

<p>I grew tired of being stared at. "If you can and&mdash;won't,
then never mind," I observed a trifle irritably, and turned to
go. But his sharp exclamation halted me.</p>

<p>"No!" he said. "No&mdash;no! Forgive me for pausing&mdash;it
was not hesitation, I assure you. To think that one&mdash;one,
even, has come! All day they pass my sign up there&mdash;pass and
fear to enter. But you are different. You are not of these
timorous, ignorant foreign peasants. You ask me to tell you the
right door? Here it is! Here!"</p>

<p>And he struck the panel of the door, which he had closed
behind him, so that the sharp yet hollow sound of it echoed up
through the silent house.</p>

<p><br>
NOW it may be thought that after all my senseless terror in
the open street, so strange a welcome from so odd a showman would
have brought the feeling back, full force. But there is an
emotion stronger, to a certain point, than fear. This queer old
fellow aroused my curiosity. What kind of museum could it be that
he accused the passing public of fearing to enter? Nothing really
terrible, surely, or it would have been closed by the police. And
normally I am not an unduly timorous person. "So it's in there,
is it?" I asked, coming toward him. "And I'm to be sole audience?
Come, that will be an interesting experience." I was half
laughing now.</p>

<p>"The most interesting in the world," said the old man, with a
solemnity which rebuked my lightness.</p>

<p>With that he opened the door, passed inward and closed it
again&mdash;in my very face. I stood staring at it blankly. The
panels, I remember, had been originally painted white, but now
the paint was flaked and blistered, gray with dirt and dirty
finger marks. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had no wish to
enter there. Whatever was behind it could be scarcely worth
seeing, or he would not choose such a place for its exhibition.
With the old man's vanishing my curiosity had cooled, but just as
I again turned to leave, the door opened and this singular
showman stuck his white-eyebrowed face through the aperture. He
was frowning impatiently. "Come in&mdash;come in!" he snapped,
and promptly withdrawing his head, once more closed the door.</p>

<p>"He has something there he doesn't want should get out," was
the very natural conclusion which I drew. "Well, since it can
hardly be anything dangerous, and he's so anxious I should see
it&mdash;here goes!"</p>

<p>With that I turned the soiled white porcelain handle, and
entered.</p>

<p><br>
THE room I came into was neither very large nor very brightly
lighted. In no way did it resemble a museum or lecture room. On
the contrary, it seemed to have been fitted up as a quite well-
appointed laboratory. The floor was linoleum-covered, there were
glass cases along the walls whose shelves were filled with
bottles, specimen jars, graduates, and the like. A large table in
one corner bore what looked like some odd sort of camera, and a
larger one in the middle of the room was fitted with a long rack
filled with bottles and test tubes, and was besides littered with
papers, glass slides, and various paraphernalia which my
ignorance failed to identify. There were several cases of books,
a few plain wooden chairs, and in the corner a large iron sink
with running water.</p>

<p>My host of the white hair and black eyes was awaiting me,
standing near the larger table. He indicated one of the wooden
chairs with a thin forefinger that shook a little, either from
age or eagerness. "Sit down&mdash;sit down! Have no fear but that
you will be interested, my friend. Have no fear at all&mdash;of
anything!"</p>

<p>As he said it he fixed his dark eyes upon me and stared harder
than ever. But the effect of his words was the opposite of their
meaning. I did sit down, because my knees gave under me, but if
in the outer hall I had lost my terror, it now returned twofold
upon me. Out there the light had been faint, dingily roseate,
indefinite. By it I had not perceived how this old man's face was
a mask of living malice&mdash;of cruelty, hate and a certain
masterful contempt. Now I knew the meaning of my fear, whose
warning I would not heed. Now I knew that I had walked into the
very trap from which my abnormal sensitiveness had striven in
vain to save me.</p>

<br>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="first">AGAIN I struggled within me, bit at my lip till
I tasted blood, and presently the blind paroxysm passed. It must
have been longer in going than I thought, and the old man must
have all that time been speaking, for when I could once more
control my attention, hear and see him, he had taken up a
position near the sink, about ten feet away, and was addressing
me with a sort of "platform" manner, as if I had been the large
audience whose absence he had deplored.</p>

<p>"And so," he was saying, "I was forced to make these plates
very carefully, to truly represent the characteristic hues of
each separate organism. Now, in color work of every kind the film
is necessarily extremely sensitive. Doubtless you are familiar in
a general way with the exquisite transparencies produced by color
photography of the single-plate type."</p>

<p>He paused, and trying to act like a normal human being, I
observed: "I saw some nice landscapes done in that way&mdash;last
week at an illustrated lecture in Franklin Hall."</p>

<p>He scowled, and made an impatient gesture at me with his hand.
"I can proceed better without interruptions," he said. "My pause
was purely oratorical."</p>

<p>I meekly subsided, and he went on in his original loud, clear
voice. He would have made an excellent lecturer before a much
larger audience&mdash;if only his voice could have lost that
eerie, ringing note. Thinking of that I must have missed some
more, and when I caught it again he was saying:</p>

<p>"As I have indicated, the original plate is the final picture.
Now, many of these organisms are extremely hard to photograph,
and microphotography in color is particularly difficult. In
consequence, to spoil a plate tries the patience of the
photographer. They are so sensitive that the ordinary darkroom
ruby lamp would instantly ruin them, and they must therefore be
developed either in darkness or by a special light produced by
interposing thin sheets of tissue of a particular shade of green
and of yellow between lamp and plate, and even that will often
cause ruinous fog. Now I, finding it hard to handle them so, made
numerous experiments with a view of discovering some glass or
fabric of a color which should add to the safety of the green,
without robbing it of all efficiency. All proved equally useless,
but intermittently I persevered&mdash;until last week."</p>

<p>His voice dropped to an almost confidential tone, and he
leaned slightly toward me. I was cold from my neck to my feet,
though my head was burning, but I tried to force an appreciative
smile.</p>

<p>"Last week," he continued impressively, "I had a prescription
filled at the corner drug store. The bottle was sent home to me
wrapped in a piece of what I first took to be whitish, slightly
opalescent paper. Later I decided that it was some kind of
membrane. When I questioned the druggist, seeking its source, he
said it was a sheet of 'paper' that was around a bundle of herbs
from South America. That he had no more, and doubted if I could
trace it. He had wrapped my bottle so, because he was in haste
and the sheet was handy.</p>

<p>"I can hardly tell you what first inspired me to try that
membrane in my photographic work. It was merely dull white with a
faint hint of opalescence, except when held against the light.
Then it became quite translucent and quite brightly prismatic.
For some reason it occurred to me that this refractive effect
might help in breaking up the actinic rays&mdash;the rays which
affect the sensitive emulsion. So that night I inserted it behind
the sheets of green and yellow tissue, next the lamp prepared my
trays and chemicals laid my plate holders to hand, turned off the
white light and&mdash;turned on the green!"</p>

<p>There was nothing in his words to inspire fear. It was a
wearisomely detailed account of his struggles with photography.
Yet, as he again paused impressively, I wished that he might
never speak again. I was desperately, contemptibly in dread of
the thing he might say next.</p>

<p><br>
SUDDENLY, he drew himself erect, the stoop went out of his
shoulders, he threw back his head and laughed. It was a hollow
sound, as if he laughed into a trumpet. "I won't tell you what I
saw! Why should I? Your own eyes shall bear witness. But this
much I'll say, so that you may better understand&mdash;later.
When our poor, faultily sensitive vision can perceive a thing, we
say that it is visible. When the nerves of touch can feel it, we
say that it is tangible. Yet I tell you there are beings
intangible to our physical sense, yet whose presence is felt by
the spirit, and invisible to our eyes merely because those organs
are not attuned to the light as reflected from their bodies. But
light passed through the screen, which we are about to use has a
wave length novel to the scientific world, and by it you shall
see with the eyes of the flesh that which has been invisible
since life began. Have no fear!"</p>

<p>He stopped to laugh again, and his mirth was yellow-
toothed&mdash; menacing.</p>

<p>"Have no fear!" he reiterated, and with that stretched his
hand toward the wall, there came a click and we were in black,
impenetrable darkness. I wanted to spring up, to seek the door by
which I had entered and rush out of it, but the paralysis of
unreasoning terror held me fast.</p>

<p>I could hear him moving about in the darkness, and a moment
later a faint green glimmer sprang up in the room. Its source was
over the large sink, where I suppose he developed his precious
"color plates."</p>

<p>Every instant, as my eyes became accustomed to the dimness, I
could see more clearly. Green light is peculiar. It may be far
fainter than red, and at the same time far more illuminating. The
old man was standing beneath it, and his face by that ghastly
radiance had the exact look of a dead man's. Besides this,
however, I could observe nothing appalling.</p>

<p>"That," continued the man, "is the simple developing light of
which I have spoken&mdash;now watch, for what you are about to
behold no mortal man but myself has ever seen before."</p>

<p>For a moment he fussed with the green lamp over the sink. It
was so constructed that all the direct rays struck downward. He
opened a flap at the side, for a moment there was a streak of
comforting white luminance from within, then he inserted
something, slid it slowly in&mdash;and closed the flap.</p>

<p>The thing he put in&mdash;that South American "membrane" it
must have been&mdash;instead of decreasing the light increased
it&mdash; amazingly. The hue was changed from green to greenish-
gray, and the whole room sprang into view, a livid, ghastly
chamber, filled with&mdash;overcrawled by&mdash;what?</p>

<p>My eyes fixed themselves, fascinated, on something that moved
by the old man's feet. It writhed there on the floor like a huge,
repulsive starfish, an immense, armed, legged thing, that twisted
convulsively. It was smooth, as if made of rubber, was whitish-
green in color; and presently raised its great round blob of a
body on tottering tentacles, crept toward my host and writhed
upward&mdash;yes, climbed up his legs, his body. And he stood
there, erect, arms folded, and stared sternly down at the thing
which climbed.</p>

<p>But the room&mdash;the whole room was alive with other
creatures than that. Everywhere I looked they
were&mdash;centipedish things, with yard-long bodies, detestable,
furry spiders that lurked in shadows, and sausage-shaped
translucent horrors that moved&mdash;and floated through the air.
They dived&mdash;here and there between me and the light, and I
could see its bright greenness through their greenish bodies.</p>

<p>Worse, though; far worse than these were the things with human
faces. Mask-like, monstrous, huge gaping mouths and slitlike
eyes&mdash;I find I cannot write of them. There was that about
them which makes their memory even now intolerable.</p>

<p>The old man was speaking again, and every word echoed in my
brain like the ringing of a gong. "Fear nothing! Among such as
these do you move every hour of the day and night. Only you and I
have seen, for God is merciful and has spared our race from
sight. But I am not merciful! I loathe the race which gave these
creatures birth&mdash;the race which might be so surrounded by
invisible, unguessed but blessed beings&mdash;and chooses these
for its companions! All the world shall see and know. One by one
shall they come here, learn the truth, and perish. For who can
survive the ultimate of terror? Then I, too, shall find peace,
and leave the earth to its heritage of man-created horrors. Do
you know what these are&mdash;whence they come?"</p>

<p>This voice boomed now like a cathedral bell. I could not
answer, him, but he waited for no reply. "Out of the
ether&mdash;out of the omnipresent ether from whose intangible
substance the mind of God made the planets, all living things,
and man&mdash;man has made these! By his evil thoughts, by his
selfish panics, by his lusts and his interminable, never-ending
hate he has made them, and they are everywhere! Fear
nothing&mdash;but see where there comes to you, its creator, the
shape and the body of your <span class="smcap">FEAR</span>!"</p>

<p>And as he said it I perceived a great Thing coming toward
me&mdash;a Thing&mdash;but consciousness could endure no more.
The ringing, threatening voice merged in a roar within my ears,
there came a merciful dimming of the terrible, lurid vision, and
blank nothingness succeeded upon horror too great for
bearing.</p>

<br>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was a dull, heavy pain above my eyes. I
knew that they were closed, that I was dreaming, and that the
rack full of colored bottles which I seemed to see so clearly was
no more than a part of the dream. There was some vague but
imperative reason why I should rouse myself. I wanted to awaken,
and thought that by staring very hard indeed I could dissolve
this foolish vision of blue and yellow-brown bottles. But instead
of dissolving they grew clearer, more solid and substantial of
appearance, until suddenly the rest of my senses rushed to the
support of sight, and I became aware that my eyes were open, the
bottles were quite real, and that I was sitting in a chair,
fallen sideways so that my cheek rested most uncomfortably on the
table which held the rack.</p>

<p>I straightened up slowly and with difficulty, groping in my
dulled brain for some clue to my presence in this unfamiliar
place, this laboratory that was lighted only by the rays of an
arc light in the street outside its three large windows. Here I
sat, alone, and if the aching of cramped limbs meant anything,
here I had sat for more than a little time.</p>

<p>Then, with the painful shock which accompanies awakening to
the knowledge of some great catastrophe, came memory. It was this
very room, shown by the street lamp's rays to be empty of life,
which I had seen thronged with creatures too loathsome for
description. I staggered to my feet, staring fearfully about.
There were the glass-floored cases, the bookshelves, the two
tables with their burdens, and the long iron sink above which,
now only a dark blotch of shadow, hung the lamp from which had
emanated that livid, terrifically revealing illumination. Then
the experience had been no dream, but a frightful reality. I was
alone here now. With callous indifference my strange host had
allowed me to remain for hours unconscious, with not the least
effort to aid or revive me. Perhaps, hating me so, he had hoped
that I would die there.</p>

<p>At first I made no effort to leave the place. Its appearance
filled me with reminiscent loathing. I longed to go, but as yet
felt too weak and ill for the effort. Both mentally and
physically my condition was deplorable, and for the first time I
realized that a shock to the mind may react upon the body as
vilely as any debauch of self-indulgence.</p>

<p>Quivering in every nerve and muscle, dizzy with headache and
nausea, I dropped back into the chair, hoping that before the old
man returned I might recover sufficient self-control to escape
him. I knew that he hated me, and why. As I waited, sick,
miserable, I understood the man. Shuddering, I recalled the
loathsome horrors he had shown me. If the mere desires and
emotions of mankind were daily carnified in such forms as those,
no wonder that he viewed his fellow beings with detestation and
longed only to destroy them.</p>

<p>I thought, too, of the cruel, sensuous faces I had seen in the
streets outside&mdash;seen for the first time, as if a veil had
been withdrawn from eyes hitherto blinded by self-delusion.
Fatuously trustful as a month-old puppy, I had lived in a grim,
evil world, where goodness is a word and crude selfishness the
only actuality. Drearily my thoughts drifted back through my own
life, its futile purposes, mistakes and activities. All of evil
that I knew returned to overwhelm me. Our gropings toward
divinity were a sham, a writhing sunward of slime&mdash;-covered
beasts who claimed sunlight as their heritage, but in their
hearts preferred the foul and easy depths.</p>

<p>Even now, though I could neither see nor feel them, this room,
the entire world, was acrawl with the beings created by our real
natures. I recalled the cringing, contemptible fear to which my
spirit had so readily yielded, and the faceless Thing to which
the emotion had given birth.</p>

<p>Then abruptly, shockingly, I remembered that every moment I
was adding to the horde. Since my mind could conceive only
repulsive incubi, and since while I lived I must think, feel, and
so continue to shape them, was there no way to check so
abominable a succession? My eyes fell on the long shelves with
their many-colored bottles. In the chemistry of photography there
are deadly poisons&mdash;I knew that. Now was the time to end
it&mdash;now! Let him return and find his desire accomplished.
One good thing I could do, if one only. I could abolish my
monster-creating self.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p class="first">My friend Mark Jenkins is an intelligent and
usually a very careful man. When he took from "Smiler" Callahan a
cigar which had every appearance of being excellent, innocent
Havana, the act denoted both intelligence and caution. By very
clever work he had traced the poisoning of young Ralph Peeler to
Mr. Callahan's door, and he believed this particular cigar to be
the mate of one smoked by Peeler just previous to his demise. And
if, upon arresting Callahan, he had not confiscated this bit of
evidence, it would have doubtless been destroyed by its
regrettably unconscientious owner.</p>

<p>But when Jenkins shortly afterward gave me that cigar, as one
of his own, he committed one of those almost inconceivable
blunders which, I think, are occasionally forced upon clever men
to keep them from overweening vanity. Discovering his slight
mistake, my detective friend spent the night searching for his
unintended victim, myself; and that his search was successful was
due to Pietro Marini, a young Italian of Jenkins' acquaintance,
whom he met about the hour of 2:00 A.M. returning from a
dance.</p>

<p>Now, Marini had seen me standing on the steps of the house
where Doctor Frederick Holt had his laboratory and living rooms,
and he had stared at me, not with any ill intent, but because he
thought I was the sickest-looking, most ghastly specimen of
humanity that he had ever beheld. And, sharing the superstition
of his South Street neighbors, he wondered if the worthy doctor
had poisoned me as well as Peeler. This suspicion he imparted to
Jenkins, who, however, had the best of reasons for believing
otherwise. Moreover, as he informed Marini, Holt was dead, having
drowned himself late the previous afternoon. An hour or so after
our talk in the restaurant, news of his suicide reached
Jenkins.</p>

<p>It seemed wise to search any place where a very sick-looking
young man had been seen to enter, so Jenkins came straight to the
laboratory. Across the fronts of those houses was the long sign
with its mysterious inscription, "See the Great Unseen," not at
all mysterious to the detective. He knew that next door to Doctor
Holt's the second floor had been thrown together into a lecture
room, where at certain hours a young man employed by settlement
workers displayed upon a screen stereopticon views of various
deadly bacilli, the germs of diseases appropriate to dirt and
indifference. He knew, too, that Doctor Holt himself had helped
the educational effort along by providing some really wonderful
lantern slides, done by micro-color photography.</p>

<p>On the pavement outside, Jenkins found the two-thirds remnant
of a cigar, which he gathered in and came up the steps, a very
miserable and self-reproachful detective. Neither outer nor inner
door was locked, and in the laboratory he found me, alive, but on
the verge of death by another means that he had feared.</p>

<p>In the extreme physical depression following my awakening from
drugged sleep, and knowing nothing of its cause, I believed my
adventure fact in its entirety. My mentality was at too low an
ebb to resist its dreadful suggestion. I was searching among
Holt's various bottles when Jenkins burst in. At first I was
merely annoyed at the interruption of my purpose, but before the
anticlimax of his explanation the mists of obsession drifted away
and left me still sick in body, but in spirit happy as any man
may well be who has suffered a delusion that the world is wholly
bad&mdash;and learned that its badness springs from his own
poisoned brain.</p>

<p>The malice which I had observed in every face, including young
Marini's, existed only in my drug-affected vision. Last week's
"popular-science" lecture had been recalled to my subconscious
mind&mdash;the mind that rules dreams and delirium&mdash;by the
photographic apparatus in Holt's workroom. "See the Great Unseen"
assisted materially, and even the corner drug store before which
I had paused, with its green-lit show vases, had doubtless played
a part. But presently, following something Jenkins told me, I was
driven to one protest. "If Holt was not here," I demanded, "if
Holt is dead, as you say, how do you account for the fact that I,
who have never seen the man, was able to give you an accurate
description which you admit to be that of Doctor Frederick
Holt?"</p>

<p>He pointed across the room. "See that?" It was a life-size
bust portrait, in crayons, the picture of a white-haired man with
bushy eyebrows and the most piercing black eyes I had ever
seen&mdash; until the previous evening. It hung facing the door
and near the windows, and the features stood out with a strangely
lifelike appearance in the white rays of the arc lamp just
outside. "Upon entering," continued Jenkins, "the first thing you
saw was that portrait, and from it your delirium built a living,
speaking man. So, there are your white-haired showman, your
unnatural fear, your color photography and your pretty green
golliwogs all nicely explained for you, Blaisdell, and thank God
you're alive to hear the explanation. If you had smoked the whole
of that cigar&mdash;well, never mind. You didn't. And now, my
very dear friend, I think it's high time that you interviewed a
real, flesh-and-blood doctor. I'll phone for a taxi."</p>

<p>"Don't," I said. "A walk in the fresh air will do me more good
than fifty doctors."</p>

<p>"Fresh air! There's no fresh air on South Street in July,"
complained Jenkins, but reluctantly yielded.</p>

<p>I had a reason for my preference. I wished to see people, to
meet face to face even such stray prowlers as might be about at
this hour, nearer sunrise than midnight, and rejoice in the
goodness and kindliness of the human
countenance&mdash;particularly as found in the lower classes.</p>

<p>But even as we were leaving there occurred to me a curious
inconsistency.</p>

<p>"Jenkins," I said, "you claim that the reason Holt, when I
first met him in the hall, appeared to twice close the door in my
face, was because the door never opened until I myself unlatched
it."</p>

<p>"Yes," confirmed Jenkins, but he frowned, foreseeing my next
question.</p>

<p>"Then why, if it was from that picture that I built so solid,
so convincing a vision of the man, did I see Holt in the hall
before the door was open?"</p>

<p>"You confuse your memories," retorted Jenkins rather
shortly.</p>

<p>"Do I? Holt was dead at that hour, but&mdash;I tell you I saw
Holt outside the door! And what was his reason for committing
suicide?"</p>

<p>Before my friend could reply I was across the room, fumbling
in the dusk there at the electric lamp above the sink. I got the
tin flap open and pulled out the sliding screen, which consisted
of two sheets of glass with fabric between, dark on one side,
yellow on the other. With it came the very thing I
dreaded&mdash;a sheet of whitish, parchmentlike, slightly
opalescent stuff.</p>

<p>Jenkins was beside me as I held it at arm's length toward the
windows. Through it the light of the arc lamp fell&mdash;divided
into the most astonishingly brilliant rainbow hues. And instead
of diminishing the light, it was perceptibly increased in the
oddest way. Almost one thought that the sheet itself was
luminous, and yet when held in shadow it gave off no light at
all.</p>

<p>"Shall we&mdash;put it in the lamp again&mdash;and try it?"
asked Jenkins slowly, and in his voice there was no hint of
mockery.</p>

<p>I looked him straight in the eyes. "No," I said, "we won't. I
was drugged. Perhaps in that condition I received a merciless
revelation of the discovery that caused Holt's suicide, but I
don't believe it. Ghost or no ghost, I refuse to ever again
believe in the depravity of the human race. If the air and the
earth are teeming with invisible horrors, they are not of our
making, and&mdash;the study of demonology is better let alone.
Shall we burn this thing, or tear it up?"</p>

<p>"We have no right to do either," returned Jenkins
thoughtfully, "but you know, Blaisdell, there's a little too darn
much realism about some parts of your 'dream.' I haven't been
smoking any doped cigars; but when you held that up to the light,
I'll swear I saw&mdash;well, never mind. Burn it&mdash;send it
back to the place it came from."</p>

<p>"South America?" said I.</p>

<p>"A hotter place than that. Burn it."</p>

<p>So he struck a match and we did. It was gone in one great
white flash.</p>

<p>A large place was given by the morning papers to the suicide
of Doctor Frederick Holt, caused, it was surmised, by mental
derangement brought about by his unjust implication in the Peeler
murder. It seemed an inadequate reason, since he had never been
arrested, but no other was ever discovered.</p>

<p>Of course, our action in destroying that "membrane" was
illegal and rather precipitate, but, though he won't talk about
it, I know that Jenkins agrees with me&mdash;doubt is sometimes
better than certainty, and there are marvels better left
unproved. Those, for instance, which concern the Powers of
Evil.</p>
