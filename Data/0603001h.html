<h1>The Misanthrope</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>J. D. Beresford</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Since I have returned from the rock and discussed the story in all
its bearings, I have begun to wonder if the man made a fool of me. In
the deeps of my consciousness I feel that he did not.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I cannot resist the effect of all the laughter that
has been evoked by my narrative.</p>

<p>Here on the mainland the whole thing seems unlikely, grotesque,
foolish. On the rock the man's confession carried absolute conviction.
The setting is everything; and I am, perhaps, thankful that my present
circumstances are so beautifully conducive to sanity. No one
appreciates the mystery of life more than I do; but when the mystery
involves such a doubt of oneself, I find it pleasanter to forget.
Naturally, I do not want to believe the story. If I did I should know
myself to be some kind of human horror. And the terror of it all lies
in the fact that I may never know precisely what kind...</p>

<p>Before I went we had eliminated the facile and banal explanation
that the man was mad, and had fallen back upon the two inevitable
alternatives: Crime and Disappointed Love. We were human and romantic,
and we tried desperately hard not to be too obvious.</p>

<p>Once before a man had made the same attempt and had built or tried
to build a house on the Gulland rock; but he had been defeated within a
fortnight, and what was left of his building was taken off the island
and turned into a tin church. It is there still. We all went to Trevone
and ruminated over and round it, perhaps with some faint hope that one
of us might, all-unknowing, have the abilities of a psychometrist.</p>

<p>Nothing came of that visit but a slight intensification of those
theories that were already becoming a little stale. We compared the
early failure of thirty years ago, the attempt that was baffled, with
the present success. For this new misanthrope had lived on the Gulland
through the whole winter--and still lived. Indeed, the fact of his
presence on that awful lump of rock was now accepted by the country
people; to them he was scarcely a shade madder than the other visitors;
that remunerative, recurrent host that this year broke their journey to
Bedruthan in order to stand on Trevone beach and stare foolishly at the
just visible hut that stuck like a cubical gall on the landward face of
that humped, desolate island.</p>

<p>We all did that; stared at nothing in particular and meditated
enormously; but in what I felt at the time was a wild spirit of
adventure, I went out one night to the point of Gunver Head and saw an
actual light within that distant hut; a patch of golden lichen on the
mother parasite.</p>

<p>Some aspect of humanity I found in that light it was that finally
decided me; that and some quality of sympathy, perhaps with the
hermit--mad, criminal, or lovelorn?--who had found sanctuary from the
pestilent touch of the encroaching crowd. It was, in fact, a wildish
night, and I stayed until the little yellow speck went out, and all I
could see through the murk was an occasional canopy of curving spray
when the elbow of the Trevone Light touched a bare corner of that black
Gulland.</p>

<p>The making of a decision was no difficult matter, but while I waited
for the necessary calm that would permit the occasional boat to land
provisions on the island two miles out from the mainland, I suffered
qualms of doubt and nervousness. And I suffered them alone, for I had
determined that no hint of my adventure should be given to anyone of
our party until the voyage had been made. They might think that I had
gone fishing, an excuse which had all the air of probability given to
it by the coming of the boatman to say that the tide and wind would
serve that morning. I had warned--and bribed--him to give no clue to my
friends of the goal of my proposed excursion.</p>

<p>My nervousness suffered no decrease as we approached the rock and
saw the authentic figure of its single inhabitant awaiting our arrival.
I had some consolation in the thought that he would be in some way
prepared by the sight of our surprisingly passengered boat; but my mind
shuddered at the necessity for using some conventional form of address
if I would make at once my introduction and excuse. The civilised
opening was so hopelessly incapable of expressing my sympathy,
presenting instead so unmistakably, it seemed to me, the single
solution of common curiosity. I wondered that he had not--as the
boatman so clearly assured me was the case--had other prying visitors
before me.</p>

<p>My self-consciousness increased as we came nearer to the single
opening among the spiked rocks, that served as a miniature harbour at
half-tide. I felt that I was being watched by the man who now stood
awaiting us at the water's edge. And suddenly my spirit broke, I
decided that I could not force myself upon him, that I would remain in
the boat while its cargo was delivered, and then return with the
boatmen to Trevone. So resolute was I in this plan that when we had
pulled in to the tiny landing-place, I kept my gaze steadfastly averted
from the man I had come to see, and stared solemnly out at the humped
back of Trevone, seen now in an entirely new aspect.</p>

<p>The sound of the hermit's voice startled me from a perfectly genuine
abstraction.</p>

<p>"Fairly decent weather to-day," he remarked with, I thought, a touch
of nervousness. He had, I remembered, addressed the same remark to the
boatmen, who were now conveying their cargo up to the hut.</p>

<p>I looked up and met his stare. He was, indeed, regarding me with a
curious effect of concentration, as if he were eager to note every
detail of my expression.</p>

<p>"Jolly," I replied. "Been pretty beastly the last day or two. Kept
you rather short, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I make allowances for that," he said. "Keep a reserve, you know.
Are you I staying over there?" He nodded towards the bay.</p>

<p>"For a week or two," I told him, and we began to discuss the country
around Harlyn with the eagerness of two strangers who find a common
topic at a dull reception.</p>

<p>"Never been on the Gulland before, I suppose?" he ventured at last,
when the boatmen had discharged their load and were evidently ready to
be off.</p>

<p>"No, no, I haven't," I said, and hesitated. I felt that the
invitation must come from him.</p>

<p>He boggled over it by saying, "Dashed awkward place to get to, and
nothing to see, of course. I don't know if you're at all keen on
fishing?"</p>

<p>"Rather," I said with enthusiasm. "There's deep water on the other
side of the rock," he went on. "In the right weather you get splendid
bass there." He stopped and then added, "It'll be absolutely top hole
for 'em, this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could come back..." I began; but the boatman interrupted
me at once.</p>

<p>"Yew can coom back to-morrow, sure 'nough," he said. "Tide only
serves wance avery twalve hours."</p>

<p>"If you'd care to stay, now..." began the hermit.</p>

<p>"Thanks! it's awfully good of you. I should like to of all things,"
I said. I stayed on the clear understanding that the boatmen were to
fetch me the next morning. At first there was really very little that
seemed in any way strange about the man on the Gulland.</p>

<p>His name, he told me, was William Copley, but it appeared that he
was no relation to the Copleys I knew. And if he had shaved he would
have looked a very ordinary type of Englishman roughing it on a
holiday. His age I judged to be between thirty and forty.</p>

<p>Only two things about him struck me as a little queer during our
very successful afternoon's fishing. The first was that intense
appraising stare of his, as if he tried to fathom the very depths of
one's being. The second was an inexplicable devotion to one particular
form of ceremony. As our intimacy grew, he dropped the ordinary formal
politeness of a host; but he insisted always on one observance that I
supposed at first to be the merely conventional business of giving
precedence.</p>

<p>Nothing would induce him to go in front of me. He sent me ahead even
as we explored the little purlieus of his rock--the only level square
yard on the whole island was in the floor of the hut. But presently I
noticed that this peculiarity went still further, and that he would not
turn his back on me for a single moment.</p>

<p>That discovery intrigued one. I still excluded the explanation of
madness--Copley's manner and conversation were so convincingly sane.
But I reverted to and elaborated those other two suggestions that had
been made. I could not avoid the inference that the man must in some
strange way be afraid of me; and I hesitated as to whether he were
flying from some form of justice or from revenge, perhaps a vendetta.
Either theory seemed to account for his intense, ap-praising stare. I
inferred that his longing for companionship had grown so strong that he
had determined to risk the possibility of my being an emissary, sent by
some--to me--exquisitely romantic person or persons who desired
Copley's death. I recalled, and wallowed in, some of the marvellous
imaginings of the novelist. I wondered if I could make Copley speak by
convincing him of my innocent identity. How I thrilled at the
prospect!</p>

<p>But the explanation of it all came without any effort on my
part.</p>

<p>He sent me out of the hut while he prepared our supper--quite a
magnificent meal, by the way.</p>

<p>I saw his reason at once; he could not manage all that business of
cooking and laying the table without turning his back on me. One thing,
however, puzzled me a little; he drew down the blind of the little
square window as soon as I had gone outside.</p>

<p>Naturally, I made no demur. I climbed down to the edge of the
sea--it was a glorious evening--and waited until he called me. He stood
at the door of the hut until I was within a few feet of him, and then
retreated into the room and sat down with his back to the wall.</p>

<p>We discussed our afternoon's sport as we had supper, but when we had
finished and our pipes were going, he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"I don't see why I shouldn't tell you."</p>

<p>Like a fool, I agreed eagerly, when I might so easily have stopped
him...</p>

<p>"It began when I was quite a kid," he said. "My mother found me
crying in the garden; and all I could tell her was that Claude, my
elder brother, looked 'horrid.' I couldn't bear the sight of him for
days afterwards, either; but I was such a perfectly normal child that
they weren't seriously perturbed about this one idiosyncrasy of mine.
They thought that Claude had 'made a face' at me, and frightened me. My
father whacked me for it eventually.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that whacking stuck in my mind. Anyway, I didn't confide my
peculiarity to anyone until I was nearly seventeen. I was ashamed of
it, of course. I am still--in a way.".He stopped and looked down,
pushed his plate away from him, and folded his arms on the table. I was
pining to ask a question, but I was afraid to interrupt. And after a
moment's hesitation he looked up and held my gaze again, but now
without that inquiring look of his.</p>

<p>Rather, he seemed to be looking for sympathy.</p>

<p>"I told my house-master," he said. "He was a splendid chap, and he
was very decent about it; took it all quite seriously and advised me to
consult an oculist, which I did. I went in the holidays with the
pater--I had given him a more reasonable account of my trouble--and he
took me to the best man in London. He was tremendously interested, and
it proves that there must be something in it, that it can't be
imagination, because he really found a defect in my eyes, something
quite new to him, he said. He called it a new form of astigmatism; but,
of course, as he pointed out, no glasses would be any use to me."</p>

<p>"But what...?" I began, unable to keep down my curiosity any
longer.</p>

<p>Copley hesitated, and dropped his eyes. "Astigmatism, you know," he
said, "is a defect--I quote the dictionary, I learned that definition
by heart; I often puzzle over it still--'causing images of lines having
a certain direction to be indistinctly seen, while those of lines
transverse to the former are distinctly seen.' Only mine is peculiar in
the fact that my sight is perfectly normal except when I look back at
anyone over my shoulder." He looked up, almost pathetically.</p>

<p>I could see that he hoped I might understand without further
explanation.</p>

<p>I had to confess myself utterly mystified. What had this trifling
defect of vision to do with his coming to live on the Gulland, I
wondered.</p>

<p>I frowned my perplexity. "But I don't see..." I said.</p>

<p>He knocked out his pipe and began to scrape the bowl with his
pocket-knife. "Well, mine is a kind of moral astigmatism, too," he
said. "At least, it gives me a kind of moral insight. I'm afraid I must
call it insight. I've proved in some cases that..." He dropped his
voice. He was apparently deeply engrossed in the scraping out of his
pipe. He kept his eyes on it as he continued.</p>

<p>"Normally, you understand, when I look at people straight in the
face, I see them as anybody else sees them. But when I look back at
them over my shoulder I see...oh! I see all their vices and defects.
Their faces remain, in a sense, the same, perfectly recognisable, I
mean, but distorted--beastly...There was my brother
Claude--good-looking chap, he was--but when I saw him...that way...he
had a nose like a parrot, and he looked sort of weakly voracious...and
vicious." He stopped and shuddered slightly, and then added: "And one
knows, now, that he is like that, too. He's just been hammered on the
Stock Exchange. Rotten sort of failure it was..."</p>

<p>"And then Denison, my house-master, you know; such a decent chap. I
never looked at him, that way, until the end of my last term at school.
I had got into the habit, more or less, of never looking over my
shoulder, you see. But I was always getting caught. That was an
instance. I was playing for the School against the Old Boys. Denison
called out, 'Good luck, old chap,' just as I was going in, and I forgot
and looked back at him..."</p>

<p>I waited, breathless, and as he did not go on, I prompted him with
"Was he...'wrong,' too?"</p>

<p>Copley nodded. "Weak, poor devil. His eyes were all right, but they
were fighting his mouth, if you know what I mean. There would have been
an awful scandal at the school there, four years after I left, if they
hadn't hushed it up and got Denison out of the country.</p>

<p>"Then, if you want any more instances, there was the oculist--big,
fine chap, he was. Of course, he made me look at him over my shoulder,
to test me. He asked me what I saw, and I told, more or less. He was
simply livid for a moment. He was a sensualist, you see; and when I saw
him that way he looked like some filthy old hog.</p>

<p>"The thing that really finished me," he went on, after a long
interval, "was the breaking off of my engagement to Helen. We were
frightfully in love with one another, and I told her about my trouble.
She was very sympathetic, and I suppose rather sentimentally romantic,
too. She believed it was some sort of spell that had been put on me. I
think, anyway, she had a theory that if I once saw anybody truly and
ordinarily over my shoulder, I should never have any more trouble--the
spell-would-be-broken sort of thing. And, of course, she wanted to be
the person. I didn't resist her much. I was infatuated, I suppose.
Anyway, I thought she was perfection and that it was simply impossible
that I could find any defect in her. So I agreed, and looked--that
way..."</p>

<p>His voice had fallen to an even note of despondency, as though the
telling of this final tragedy in his life had brought him to the
indifference of despair. "I looked," he continued, "and saw a creature
with no chin and watery, doting eyes; a faithful, slobbery thing--eugh!
I can't...I never spoke to her again...</p>

<p>"That broke me, you know," he said presently. "After that I didn't
care. I used to look at everyone that way, until I had to get away from
humanity. I was living in a world of beasts. Most of them looked like
some beast or bird or other. The strong were vicious and criminal; and
the weak were loathsome. I couldn't stick it. In the end--I had to come
here away from them all."</p>

<p>A thought occurred to me. "Have you ever looked at yourself in the
glass?" I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I'm no better than the rest of them," he said. "That's
why I grew this rotten beard. I hadn't got a looking-glass here."</p>

<p>"And you can't keep a stiff neck, as it were," I asked, "going about
looking humanity straight in the face?"</p>

<p>"The temptation is too strong," Copley said. "And it gets stronger.
Curiosity, partly, I suppose; but partly it's the momentary sense of
superiority it gives you. You see them like that, you know, and forget
how you look yourself. And then after a bit it sickens you."</p>

<p>"You haven't..." I said, and hesitated. I wanted to know and yet I
was horribly afraid. "You haven't," I began again, "er--you
haven't--er--looked at me yet...that way?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose..."</p>

<p>"Probably. You look all right, of course. But then so did heaps of
the others."</p>

<p>"You've no idea how I should look to you, that way?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely none. I've been trying to guess, but I can't."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't care...?"</p>

<p>"Not now," he said sharply. "Perhaps, just before you go."</p>

<p>"You feel fairly certain, then...?"</p>

<p>He nodded with disgusting conviction.</p>

<p>I went to bed, wondering whether Helen's theory wasn't a true one;
and if I might not break the spell for poor Copley.</p>

<p>The boatmen came for me soon after eleven next morning.</p>

<p>I had shaken off some of the feeling of superstitious horror that
had held me overnight, and I had not repeated my request to Copley; nor
had he offered to look into the dark places of my soul.</p>

<p>He came down after me to the landing-place and we shook hands
warmly, but he said nothing about my revisiting him.</p>

<p>And then, just as we were putting off, he turned back towards the
hut and looked at me over his shoulder--just one quick glance.</p>

<p>"Wait," I commanded the boatmen, and I stood up and called to
him.</p>

<p>"I say, Copley," I shouted.</p>

<p>He turned and looked at me, and I saw that his face was
transfigured. He wore an expression of foolish disgust and loathing. I
had seen something like it on the face of an idiot child who was just
going to be sick.</p>

<p>I dropped down into the boat and turned my back on him.</p>

<p>I wondered then if that was how he had seen himself in the
glass.</p>

<p>But since I have only wondered what it was he saw in me...</p>

<p>And I can never go back to ask him.</p>
