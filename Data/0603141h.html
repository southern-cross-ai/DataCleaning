<h1>The Dream</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Mary Shelley</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The time of the occurrence of the little legend about to be
narrated, was that of the commencement of the reign of Henry IV of
France, whose accession and conversion, while they brought peace to the
kingdom whose throne he ascended, were inadequate to heal the deep
wounds mutually inflicted by the inimical parties. Private feuds, and
the memory of mortal injuries, existed between those now apparently
united; and often did the hands that had clasped each p other in
seeming friendly greeting, involuntarily, as the grasp was released,
clasp the dagger's hilt, as fitter spokesman to their passions than the
words of courtesy that had just fallen from their lips. Many of the
fiercer Catholics retreated to their distant provinces; and while they
concealed in solitude their rankling discontent, not less keenly did
they long for the day when they might show it openly. In a large and
fortified ch&acirc;teau built on a rugged steep overlooking the Loire,
not far from the town of Nantes, dwelt the last of her race, and the
heiress of their fortunes, the young and beautiful Countess de
Villeneuve. She had spent the preceding year in complete solitude in
her secluded abode; and the mourning she wore for a father and two
brothers, the victims of the civil wars, was a graceful and good reason
why she did not appear at court, and mingle with its festivities. But
the orphan countess inherited a high name and broad lands; and it was
soon signified to her that the king, her guardian, desired that she
should bestow them, together with her hand, upon some noble whose birth
and accomplishments should entitle him to the gift. Constance, in
reply, expressed her intention of taking vows, and retiring to a
convent. The king earnestly and resolutely forbade this act, believing
such an idea to be the result of sensibility overwrought by sorrow, and
relying on the hope that, after a time, the genial spirit of youth
would break through this cloud.</p>

<p>A year passed, and still the countess persisted; and at last Henry,
unwilling, to exercise compulsion,--desirous, too, of judging for
himself of the motives that led one so beautiful, young, and gifted
with fortune's favours, to desire to bury herself in a
cloister,--announced his intention, now that the period of her mourning
was expired, of visiting her ch&acirc;teau; and if he brought not with
him, the monarch said, inducement sufficient to change her design, he
would yield his consent to its fulfilment.</p>

<p>Many a sad hour had Constance passed--many a day of tears, and many
a night of restless misery. She had closed her gates against every
visitant; and, like the Lady Olivia in 'Twelfth Night', vowed herself
to loneliness and weeping. Mistress of herself, she easily silenced the
entreaties and remonstrances of underlings, and nursed her grief as it
had been the thing she loved. Yet it was too keen, too bitter, too
burning, to be a favoured guest. In fact, Constance, young, ardent, and
vivacious, battled with it, struggled and longed to cast it off; but
all that was joyful in itself, or fair in outward show, only served to
renew it; and she could best support the burden of her sorrow with
patience, when, yielding to it, it oppressed but did not torture
her.</p>

<p>Constance had left the castle to wander in the neighbouring grounds.
Lofty and extensive as were the apartments of her abode, she felt pent
up within their walls, beneath their fretted roofs. The spreading
uplands and the antique wood, associated to her with every dear
recollection of her past life, enticed her to spend hours and days
beneath their leafy coverts. The motion and change eternally working,
as the wind stirred among the boughs, or the journeying sun rained its
beams through them, soothed and called her out of that dull sorrow
which clutched her heart with so unrelenting a pang beneath her castle
roof.</p>

<p>There was one spot on the verge of the well-wooded park, one nook of
ground, whence she could discern the country extended beyond, yet which
was in itself thick set with tall umbrageous trees--a spot which she
had forsworn, yet whither unconsciously her steps for ever tended, and
where again for the twentieth time that day, she had unaware found
herself. She sat upon a grassy mound, and looked wistfully on the
flowers she had herself planted to adorn the verdurous recess--to her
the temple of memory and love. She held the letter from the king which
was the parent to her of so much despair. Dejection sat upon her
features, and her gentle heart asked fate why, so young, unprotected,
and forsaken, she should have to struggle with this new form of
wretchedness.</p>

<p>'I but ask,' she thought, 'to live in my father's halls--in the spot
familiar to my infancy--to water with my frequent tears the graves of
those I loved; and here in these woods, where such a mad dream of
happiness was mine, to celebrate for ever the obsequies of Hope!'</p>

<p>A rustling among the boughs now met her ear--her heart beat
quick--all again was still.</p>

<p>'Foolish girl!' she half muttered; 'dupe of thine own passionate
fancy: because here we met; because seated here I have expected, and
sounds like these have announced, his dear approach; so now every coney
as it stirs, and every bird as it awakens silence, speaks of him. O
Gaspar!--mine once--never again will this beloved spot be made glad by
thee--never more!'</p>

<p>Again the bushes were stirred, and footsteps were heard in the
brake. She rose; her heart beat high; it must be that silly Manon, with
her impertinent entreaties for her to return. But the steps were firmer
and slower than would be those of her waiting-woman; and now emerging
from the shade, she too plainly discerned the intruder. He first
impulse was to fly: but once again to see him--to hear his voice:--once
again before she placed eternal vows between them, to stand together,
and find the wide chasm filled which absence had made, could not injure
the dead, and would soften the fatal sorrow that made her cheek so
pale.</p>

<p>And now he was before, her, the same beloved one with whom she had
exchanged vows of constancy. He, like her, seemed sad; nor could she
resist the imploring glance that entreated her for one moment to
remain.</p>

<p>'I come, lady,' said the young knight, 'without a hope to bend your
inflexible will. I come but once again to see you, and to bid you
farewell before I depart for the Holy Land. I come to beseech you not
to immure yourself in the dark cloister to avoid one as hateful as
myself,--one you will never see more. Whether I die or live, France and
I are parted for ever!'</p>

<p>'That were fearful, were it true,' said Constance; 'but King Henry
will never so lose his favourite cavalier. The throne you helped to
build, you still will guard. Nay, as I ever had power over thought of
thine, go not to Palestine.'</p>

<p>'One word of yours could detain me--one smile--Constance'--and the
youthful lover knelt before her; but her harsher purpose was recalled
by the image once so dear and familiar, now so strange and so
forbidden.</p>

<p>'Linger no longer here!' she cried. 'No smile, no word of mine will
ever again be yours. Why are you here--here, where the spirits of the
dead wander, and claiming these shades as their own, curse the false
girl who permits their murderer to disturb their sacred repose?'</p>

<p>'When love was young and you were kind,' replied the knight, 'you
taught me to thread the intricacies of these woods you welcomed me to
this dear spot, where once you vowed to be my own--even beneath these
ancient trees.'</p>

<p>'A wicked sin it was,' said Constance, 'to unbar my father's doors
to the son of his enemy, and dearly is it punished!'</p>

<p>The young knight gained courage as she spoke; yet he dared not move,
lest she, who, every instant, appeared ready to take flight, should be
startled from her momentary tranquillity, but he slowly
replied:--'Those were happy days, Constance, full of terror and deep
joy, when evening brought me to your feet; and while hate and vengeance
were as its atmosphere to yonder frowning castle, this leafy, starlit
bower was the shrine of love.'</p>

<p>'Happy?--miserable days!' echoed Constance; 'when I imagined good
could arise from failing in my duty, and that disobedience would be
rewarded of God. Speak not of love, Gaspar!--a sea of blood divides us
for ever! Approach me not! The dead and the beloved stand even now
between us: their pale shadows warn me of my fault, and menace me for
listening to their murderer.'</p>

<p>'That am not I!' exclaimed the youth. 'Behold, Constance, we are
each the last of our race. Death has dealt cruelly with us, and we are
alone. It was not so when first we loved--when parent, kinsman,
brother, nay, my own mother breathed curses on the house of Villeneuve;
and in spite of all I blessed it. I saw thee, my lovely one, and
blessed it. The God of peace planted love in our hearts, and with
mystery and secrecy we met during many a summer night in the moonlit
dells; and when daylight was abroad, in this sweet recess we fled to
avoid its scrutiny, and here, even here, where now I kneel in
supplication, we both knelt and made our vows. Shall they be
broken?'</p>

<p>Constance wept as her lover recalled the images of happy hours.
'Never,' she exclaimed, 'O never! Thou knowest, or wilt soon know,
Gaspar, the faith and resolves of one who dare not be yours. Was it for
us to talk of love and happiness, when war, and hate, and blood were
raging around! The fleeting flowers our young hands strewed were
trampled by the deadly encounter of mortal foes. By your father's hand
mine died; and little boots it to know whether, as my brother swore,
and you deny, your hand did or did not deal the blow that destroyed
him. You fought among those by whom he died. Say no more--no other
word: it is impiety towards the unreposing dead to hear you. Go,
Gaspar; forget me. Under the chivalrous and gallant Henry your career
may he glorious; and some fair girl will listen, as once I did, to your
vows, and be made happy by them. Farewell! May the Virgin bless you! In
my cell and cloister-home I will not forget the best Christian
lesson--to pray for our enemies. Gaspar, farewell!'</p>

<p>She glided hastily from the bower: with swift steps she threaded the
glade and sought the castle. Once within the seclusion of her own
apartment she gave way to the burst of grief that tore her gentle bosom
like a tempest; for hers was that worst sorrow, which taints past joys,
making wait upon the memory of bliss, and linking love and fancied
guilt in such fearful society as that of the tyrant when he bound a
living body to a corpse. Suddenly a thought darted into her mind. At
first she rejected it as puerile and superstitious; but it would not be
driven away. She called hastily for her attendant. 'Manon,' she said,
'didst thou ever sleep on St Catherine's couch?'</p>

<p>Manon crossed herself. 'Heaven forefend! None ever did, since I was
born, but two: one fell into the Loire and was drowned; the other only
looked upon the narrow bed, and turned to her own home without a word.
It is an awful place; and if the votary have not led a pious and good
life, woe betide the hour when she rests her head on the holy
stone!'</p>

<p>Constance crossed herself also. 'As for our lives, it is only
through our Lord and the blessed saints that we can any of us hope for
righteousness. I will sleep on that couch tomorrow night!'</p>

<p>'Dear, my lady! and the king arrives tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'The more need that I resolve. It cannot be that misery so intense
should dwell in any heart, and no cure be found. I had hoped to be the
bringer of peace to our houses; and if the good work to be for me a
crown of thorns Heaven shall direct me. I will rest tomorrow night on
St Catherine's bed: and if, as I have heard, the saint deigns to direct
her votaries in dreams, I will be guided by her; and, believing that I
act according to the dictates of Heaven, I shall feel resigned even to
the worst.'</p>

<p>The king was on his way to Nantes from Paris, and he slept in this
night at a castle but a few miles distant Before dawn a young cavalier
was introduced into his chamber. The knight had a serious, nay, a sad
aspect; and all beautiful as he was in feature and limb, looked wayworn
and haggard. He stood silent in Henry's presence, who, alert and gay,
turned his lively blue eyes upon his guest, saying gently, 'So thou
foundest her obdurate, Gaspar?'</p>

<p>'I found her resolved on our mutual misery. Alas! my liege, it is
not, credit me, the least of my grief, that Constance sacrifices her
own happiness when she destroys mine.'</p>

<p>'And thou believest that she will say nay to the gaillard chevalier
whom we ourselves present to her?'</p>

<p>'Oh, my liege, think not that thought! it cannot be. My heart
deeply, most deeply, thanks you for your generous condescension. But
she whom her lover's voice in solitude--whose entreaties, when memory
and seclusion aided the spell--could not persuade, will resist even
your majesty's commands. She is bent upon entering a cloister; and I,
so please you, will now take my leave:--I am henceforth a soldier of
the cross.'</p>

<p>'Gaspar,' said the monarch, 'I know woman better than thou. It is
not by submission nor tearful plaints she is to be won. The death of
her relatives naturally sits heavy at the young countess' heart; and
nourishing in solitude her regret and her repentance, she fancies that
Heaven itself forbids your union. Let the voice of the world reach
her--the voice of earthly power and earthly kindness--the one
commanding, the other pleading, and both finding response in her own
heart--and by my say and the Holy Cross. she will be yours. Let our
plan still hold. And now to horse: the morning wears, and the sun is
risen.'</p>

<p>The king arrived at the bishop's palace, and proceeded forthwith to
mass in the cathedral. A sumptuous dinner succeeded, and it was
afternoon before the monarch proceeded through the town beside the
Loire to where, a little above Nantes, the Chateau Villeneuve was
situated. The, young countess received him at the gate. Henry looked in
vain for the cheek blanched by misery, the aspect of downcast despair
which he had been taught to expect. Her cheek was flushed, her manner
animated, her voice scarce tremulous. 'She loves him not,' thought
Henry, or already her heart has consented.'</p>

<p>A collation was prepared for the monarch; and after some little
hesitation, arising from the cheerfulness of her mien, he mentioned the
name of Gaspar. Constance blushed instead of turning pale, and replied
very quickly, 'Tomorrow, good my liege; I ask for a respite but until
tomorrow;--all will then be decided;--tomorrow I am vowed to
God--or'--</p>

<p>She looked confused, and the king, at once surprised and pleased,
said, 'Then you hate not young De Vaudemont;--you forgive him for the
inimical blood that warms his veins.'</p>

<p>'We are taught that we should forgive, that we should love our
enemies,' the countess replied, with some trepidation.</p>

<p>'Now, by Saint Denis, that is a right welcome answer for the
novice,' said the king, laughing. 'What ho! my faithful servingman, Don
Apollo in disguise! come forward, and thank your lady for her
love.'</p>

<p>In such disguise as had concealed him from all, the cavalier had
hung behind, and viewed with infinite surprise the demeanour and calm
countenance of the lady. He could not hear her words: but was this even
she whom he had seen trembling and weeping the evening before? this she
whose very heart was torn by conflicting passion?--who saw the pale
ghosts of parent and kinsman stand between her and the lover whom more
than her life she adored? It was a riddle hard to solve. The king's
call was in unison with his impatience, and he sprang forward. He was
at her feet; while she, still passion-driven overwrought by the very
calmness she had assumed, uttered one cry as she recognized him and
sank senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>All this was very unintelligible. Even when her attendants had
brought her to life, another fit succeeded, and then passionate floods
of tears; while the monarch, waiting in the hall, eyeing the half-eaten
collation, and, humming some romance in commemoration of woman's
waywardness, knew not how to reply to Vaudemont's look of bitter
disappointment and anxiety. At length the countess' chief attendant
came with an apology. 'Her lady was ill, very ill. The next day she
would throw herself at the king's feet, at once to solicit his excuse,
and to disclose her purpose.'</p>

<p>'Tomorrow--again tomorrow! Does tomorrow bear some charm, maiden?'
said the king. 'Can you read us the riddle pretty one? What strange
tale belongs to tomorrow, that all rests on its advent?</p>

<p>Manon coloured, looked down, and hesitated. But Henry was no tyro in
the art of enticing ladies' attendants to disclose their ladies'
council. Manon was besides, frightened by the countess' scheme, on
which she was still obstinately bent, so she was the more readily
induced to betray it. To sleep in St Catherine's bed, to rest on a
narrow ledge overhanging the deep rapid Loire, and if, as was most
probable, the luckless dreamer escaped from falling into it, to take
the disturbed visions that, such uneasy slumber might produce for the
dictate of Heaven, was a madness of which even Henry himself could
scarcely deem any woman capable. But could Constance, her whose beauty
was so highly intellectual, and whom he had heard perpetually praised
for her strength of mind and talents, could she be so strangely
infatuated! And can passion play such freaks with us?--like death,
levelling even the aristocracy of the soul, and bringing noble and
peasant, the wise and foolish, under one thraldom? It was strange--yes
she must have her way. That she hesitated in her decision was much; and
it was to be hoped that St Catherine would play no ill-natured part.
Should it be otherwise, a purpose to be swayed by a dream might be
influenced by other waking thoughts. To the more material kind of
danger some safeguard should be brought.</p>

<p>There is no feeling more awful than that which invades a weak human
heart bent upon gratifying its ungovernable impulses in contradiction
to the dictates of conscience. Forbidden pleasures are said to be the
most agreeable;--it may be so to rude natures, to those who love to
struggle, combat, and contest; who find happiness in a fray, and joy in
the conflict of passion. But softer and sweeter was the gentle spirit
of Constance; and love and duty contending crushed and tortured her
poor heart. To commit her conduct to the inspirations of religion, or,
if it was so to be named, of superstition, was a blessed relief. The
very perils that threatened her undertaking gave zest to it;--to dare
for his sake was happiness;--the very difficulty of the way that led to
the completion of her wishes at once gratified her love and distracted
her thoughts from her despair. Or if it was decreed that she must
sacrifice all, the risk of danger and of death were of trifling import
in comparison with the anguish which would then be her portion for
ever.</p>

<p>The night threatened to be stormy, the raging wind shook the
casements, and the trees waved their huge shadowy arms, as giants might
in fantastic dance and mortal broil. Constance and Manon, unattended,
quitted the chateau by a postern, and began to descend the hillside.
The moon had not yet risen; and though the way was familiar to both,
Manon tottered and trembled; while the countess, drawing her silken
cloak around her, walked with a firm step down the steep. They came to
the river's side, where a small boat was moored, and one man was in
waiting. Constance stepped lightly in, and then aided her fearful
companion. In a few moments they were in the middle of the stream. The
warm, tempestuous, animating, equinoctial wind swept over them. For the
first time since her mourning, a thrill of pleasure swelled the bosom
of Constance. She hailed the emotion with double joy. It cannot be, she
thought, that Heaven will forbid me to love one so brave, so generous,
and so good as the noble Gaspar. Another I can never love; I shall die
if divided from him; and this heart, these limbs, so alive with glowing
sensation, are they already predestined to an early grave? Oh no! life
speaks aloud within them: I shall live to love. Do not all things
love?--the winds as they whisper to the rushing waters? the waters as
they kiss the flowery banks, and speed to mingle with the sea? Heaven
and earth are sustained by, and live through, love; and shall Constance
alone, whose heart has ever been a deep, gushing, overflowing well of
true affection, be compelled to set a stone upon the fount to lock it
up for ever?</p>

<p>These thoughts bade fair for pleasant dreams; and perhaps the
countess, an adept in the blind god's lore, therefore indulged them the
more readily. But as thus she was engrossed by soft emotions, Manon
caught her arm:--'Lady, look,' she cried; 'it comes yet the oars have
no sound. Now the Virgin shield us! Would we were at home!'</p>

<p>A dark boat glided by them. Four rowers, habited in black cloaks,
pulled at oars which, as Manon said, gave no sound; another sat at the
helm: like the rest, his person was veiled in a dark mantle, but he
wore no cap; and though his face was turned from them, Constance
recognized her lover. 'Gaspar,' she cried aloud, 'dost thou live?'--but
the figure in the boat neither turned its head nor replied, and quickly
it was lost. in the shadowy waters.</p>

<p>How changed now was the fair countess' reverie! Already Heaven had
begun its spell, and unearthly forms were around, as she strained her
eyes through the gloom. Now she saw and now she lost view of the bark
that occasioned her terror; and now it seemed that another was there,
which held the spirits of the dead; and her father waved to her from
shore, and her brothers frowned on her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they neared the landing. Her bark was moored in a little
cove, and Constance stood upon the bank. Now she trembled, and half
yielded to Manon's entreaty to return; till the unwise suivante
mentioned the king's and De Vaudemont's name, and spoke of the answer
to be given tomorrow. What answer, if she turned back from her
intent?</p>

<p>She now hurried forward up the broken ground of the bank, and then
along its edge, till they came to a bill which abruptly hung over the
tide. A small chapel stood near. With trembling fingers the countess
drew forth the key and unlocked its door. They entered. It was
dark--save that a little lamp, flickering in the wind, showed an
uncertain light from before the figure of Saint Catherine. The two
women knelt; they prayed; and then rising, with a cheerful accent the
countess bade her attendant good-night. She unlocked a little low iron
door. It opened on a narrow cavern. The roar of waters was heard
beyond. 'Thou mayest not follow, my poor Manon,' said Constance,--'nor
dost thou much desire:--this adventure is for me alone.'</p>

<p>It was hardly fair to leave the trembling servant in the chapel
alone, who had neither hope nor fear, nor love, nor grief to beguile
her; but, in those days, esquires and waiting-women often played the
part of subalterns in the army, gaming knocks and no fame. Besides,
Manon was safe in holy ground. The countess meanwhile pursued her way
groping in the dark through the narrow tortuous passage. At length what
seemed light to her long darkened sense gleamed on her. She reached an
open cavern in the overhanging hill's side, looking over the rushing
tide beneath. She looked out upon the night. The waters of the Loire
were speeding, as since that day have they ever sped--changeful, yet
the same; the heavens were thickly veiled with clouds, and the wind in
the trees was as mournful and ill-omened as if it rushed round a
murderer's tomb. Constance shuddered a little, and looked upon her,
bed,--a narrow ledge of earth and a grown stone bordering on the very
verge of the precipice. She doffed her mantle,--such was one of the
conditions of the spell;--she bowed her head, and loosened the tresses
of her dark hair; she bared her feet; and thus, fully prepared for
suffering to the utmost the chill influence of the cold night, she
stretched herself on the narrow couch that scarce afforded room for her
repose, and whence, if she moved in sleep, she must he precipitated
into the cold waters below.</p>

<p>At first it seemed to her as if she never should sleep again. No
great wonder that exposure to the blast and her perilous position
should forbid her eyelids to close. At length she fell into a reverie
so soft and soothing that she wished even to watch; and then by degrees
her senses became confused; and now she was on St Catherine's bed--the
Loire rushing beneath, and the wild wind sweeping by--and now--oh
whither?--and what dreams did the saint send, to drive her to despair,
or to bid her be blest for ever?</p>

<p>Beneath the rugged hill, upon the dark tide, another watched, who
feared a thousand things, and scarce dared hope. He had meant to
precede the lady on her way, but when he found that he had outstayed
his time, with muffled oars and breathless haste he had shot by the
bark that contained his Constance, nor even turned at her voice,
fearful to incur her blame, and her commands to return. He had seen her
emerge from the passage, and shuddered as she leant over the cliff. He
saw her step forth, clad as she was in white, and could mark her as she
lay on the edge beetling above. What a vigil did the lovers keep!--she
given up to visionary thoughts, he knowing--and the consciousness
thrilled his bosom with strange emotion--that love, and love for him,
had led her to that perilous couch; and that while angers surrounded
her in every shape, she was alive only to a small still voice that
whispered to her heart the dream which was to decide their destinies.
She slept perhaps--but he waked rid watched; and night wore away, as
now praying, now entranced by alternating hope and fear, he sat in his
boat, his eyes fixed on the white garb of the slumberer above.</p>

<p>Morning--was it morning that struggled in the clouds? Would morning
ever come to waken her? And had she slept? and what dreams of weal or
woe had peopled her sleep? Gaspar grew impatient. He commanded his
boatmen still to wait, and he sprang forward, intent on clambering the
precipice. In vain they urged the danger, nay, the impossibility of the
attempt; he clung to the rugged face of the hill, and found footing
where it would seem no footing was. The acclivity, indeed, was not
high; the dangers of St Catherine's bed arising from the likelihood
that any one who slept on so narrow a couch would be precipitated into
the waters beneath. Up the steep ascent Gaspar continued to toil, and
at last reached the roots of a tree that grew near the summit. Aided by
its branches, he made good his stand at the very extremity of the
ledge, near the pillow on which lay the uncovered head of his beloved.
Her hands were folded on her bosom; her dark hair fell round her throat
and pillowed her cheek; her face was serene: sleep was there in all its
innocence and in all its helplessness; every wilder emotion was hushed,
and her bosom heaved in regular breathing. He could see her heart beat
as it lifted her fair hands crossed above. No statue hewn of marble in
monumental effigy was ever half so fair; and within that surpassing
form dwelt a soul true, tender, self-devoted, and affectionate as ever
warmed a human breast.</p>

<p>With what deep passion did Gaspar gaze, gathering hope from the
placidity of her angel countenance! A smile wreathed her lips, and he
too involuntarily smiled, as he hailed the happy omen; when suddenly
her cheek was flushed, her bosom heaved, a tear stole from her dark
lashes, and then a whole shower fell, as starting up she cried,
'No!--he shall not die!--I will unloose his chains!--I will save him!'
Gaspar's hand was there. He caught her light form ready to fall from
the perilous couch. She opened her eyes and beheld her lover, who had
watched over her dream of fate, and who had saved her.</p>

<p>Manon also had slept well, dreaming or not, and was startled in the
morning to find that she waked surrounded by a crowd. The little
desolate chapel was hung with tapestry, the altar adorned with golden
chalices--the priest was chanting mass to a goodly array of kneeling
knights. Manon saw that King Henry was there; and she looked for
another whom she found not, when the iron door of the cavern passage
opened, and Gaspar de Vaudemont entered from it, leading the fair form
of Constance; who, in her white robes and dark dishevelled hair, with a
face in which smiles and blushes contended with deeper emotion,
approached the altar, and, kneeling with her lover, pronounced the vows
that united them for ever.</p>

<p>It was long before the happy Gaspar could win from his lady the
secret of her dream. In spite of the happiness she now enjoyed, she had
suffered too much not to look back even with terror to those days when
she thought love a crime, and every event connected with them wore an
awful aspect. 'Many a vision,' she said, 'she had that fearful night.
She had seen the spirits of her father and brothers in Paradise; she
had beheld Gaspar victoriously combating among the infidels; she had
beheld him in King Henry's court, favoured and beloved; and she
herself--now pining in a cloister, now a bride, now grateful to Heaven
for the full measure of bliss presented to her, now weeping away her
sad days--till suddenly she thought herself in Paynim land; and the
saint herself, St Catherine, guiding her unseen through the city of the
infidels. She entered a palace, and beheld the miscreants rejoicing in
victory; and then, descending to the dungeons beneath, they groped
their way through damp vaults, and low, mildewed passages, to one cell,
darker more frightful than the rest. On the floor lay one with soiled
tattered garments, with unkempt locks and wild, matted beard. His cheek
was worn and thin; his eyes had lost their fire; his form was a mere
skeleton; the chains hung loosely on the fleshless bones.'</p>

<p>'And was it my appearance in that attractive state and winning
costume that softened the hard heart of Constance?' asked Gaspar,
smiling at this painting of what would never be.</p>

<p>'Even so,' replied Constance; 'for my heart whispered me that this
was my doing; and who could recall the life that waned in your
pulses--who restore, save the destroyer? My heart never warmed to my
living, happy knight as then it did to his wasted image as it lay, in
the visions of night, at my feet. A veil fell from my eyes; a darkness
was dispelled from before me. Methought I then knew for the first time
what life and what death was. I was bid believe that to make the living
happy was not to injure the dead; and I felt how wicked and how vain
was that false philosophy which placed virtue and good in hatred, and
unkindness. You should not die; I would loosen your chains and save
you, and bid you live for love. I sprang forward, and the death I
deprecated for you would, in my presumption, have been mine,--then,
when first I felt the real value of life,--but that your arm was there
to save me, your dear voice to bid me be blest for evermore.'</p>
