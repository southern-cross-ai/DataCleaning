<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">LIKE the Conan epos, the stories featuring King Kull are set in a pseudo-historical period that Robert E. Howard called the "Hyborian Age." He described this era in some detail in an essay published under the homonymous title in the February 1936 issue of <i>The Phantagraph</i>. The following excerpts provide a context for the present story. The complete essay is available here:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603571h.html">
The Hyborian Age</a></p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"OF that epoch known by the Nemedian chroniclers as the Pre-Cataclysmic Age, little is known except the latter part, and that is veiled in the mists of legendry. Known history begins with the waning of the Pre-Cataclysmic civilization, dominated by the kingdoms of Kamelia, Valusia, Verulia, Grondar, Thule and Commoria. These peoples spoke a similar language, arguing a common origin. There were other kingdoms, equally civilized, but inhabited by different, and apparently older races.</p>

<p class="quote">"The barbarians of that age were the Picts, who lived on islands far out on the western ocean; the Atlanteans, who dwelt on a small continent between the Pictish Islands and the main, or Thurian Continent; and the Lemurians, who inhabited a chain of large islands in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p class="quote">"There were vast regions of unexplored land. The civilized kingdoms, though enormous in extent, occupied a comparatively small portion of the whole planet. Valusia was the western-most kingdom of the Thurian Continent; Grondar the eastern-most. East of Grondar, whose people were less highly cultured than those of their kindred kingdoms, stretched a wild and barren expanse of deserts. Among the less arid stretches of desert, in the jungles, and among the mountains, lived scattered clans and tribes of primitive savages. Far to the south there was a mysterious civilization, unconnected with the Thurian culture, and apparently pre-human in its nature. On the far-eastern shores of the Continent there lived another race, human, but mysterious and non-Thurian, with which the Lemurians from time to time came in contact. They apparently came from a shadowy and nameless continent lying somewhere east of the Lemurian Islands.</p>

<p class="quote">"The Thurian civilization was crumbling; their armies were composed largely of barbarian mercenaries. Picts, Atlanteans and Lemurians were their generals, their statesmen, often their kings. Of the bickerings of the kingdoms, and the wars between Valusia and Commoria, as well as the conquests by which the Atlanteans founded a kingdom on the mainland, there were more legends than accurate history."</p>

<p class="verse" style="margin-left:36%">
"A wild, weird clime that lieth sublime<br>
Out of Space, out of Time."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;
Poe</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THERE comes, even to kings, the time of great
weariness. Then the gold of the throne is brass, the silk of the
palace becomes drab. The gems in the diadem sparkle drearily like
the ice of the white seas; the speech of men is as the empty
rattle of a jester's bell and the feel comes of things unreal;
even the sun is copper in the sky, and the breath of the green
ocean is no longer fresh.</p>

<p>Kull sat upon the throne of Valusia and the hour of weariness
was upon him. They moved before him in an endless, meaningless
panorama: men, women, priests, events and shadows of events;
things seen and things to be attained. But like shadows they came
and went, leaving no trace upon his consciousness, save that of a
great mental fatigue. Yet Kull was not tired. There was a longing
in him for things beyond himself and beyond the Valusian court.
An unrest stirred in him, and strange, luminous dreams roamed his
soul. At his bidding there came to him Brule the Spear-slayer,
warrior of Pictland, from the islands beyond the West.</p>

<p>"Lord king, you are tired of the life of the court. Come with
me upon my galley and let us roam the tides for a space."</p>

<p>"Nay." Kull rested his chin moodily upon his mighty hand. "I
am weary beyond all these things. The cities hold no lure for
me&mdash;and the borders are quiet. I hear no more the sea-songs
I heard when I lay as a boy on the booming crags of Atlantis, and
the night was alive with blazing stars. No more do the green
woodlands beckon me as of old. There is a strangeness upon me and
a longing beyond life's longings. Go!"</p>

<p>Brule went forth in a doubtful mood, leaving the king brooding
upon his throne. Then to Kull stole a girl of the court and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Great king, seek Tuzun Thune, the wizard. The secrets of life
and death are his, and the stars in the sky, the lands beneath
the seas."</p>

<p>Kull looked at the girl. Fine gold was her hair and her violet
eyes were slanted strangely; she was beautiful, but her beauty
meant little to Kull.</p>

<p>"Tuzun Thune," he repeated. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A wizard of the Elder Race. He lives here in Valusia, by the
Lake of Visions in the House of a Thousand Mirrors. All things
are known to him, lord king; he speaks with the dead and holds
converse with the demons of the Lost Lands."</p>

<p>Kull arose.</p>

<p>"I will seek out this mummer; but no word of my going, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"I am your slave, my lord." And she sank to her knees meekly,
but the smile of her scarlet mouth was cunning behind Kull's back
and the gleam of her narrow eyes was crafty.</p>

<p><br>
KULL came to the house of Tuzun Thune, beside the Lake of
Visions. Wide and blue stretched the waters of the lake, and many
a fine palace rose upon its banks; many swan-winged pleasure
boats drifted lazily upon its hazy surface and evermore there
came the sound of soft music.</p>

<p>Tall and spacious, but unpretentious, rose the House of a
Thousand Mirrors. The great doors stood open, and Kull ascended
the broad stair and entered, unannounced. There in a great
chamber, whose walls were of mirrors, he came upon Tuzun Thune,
the wizard. The man was ancient as the hills of Zalgara; like
wrinkled leather was his skin, but his cold gray eyes were like
sparks of sword steel.</p>

<p>"Kull of Valusia, my house is yours," said he, bowing with
old-time courtliness and motioning Kull to a throne-like
chair.</p>

<p>"You are a wizard, I have heard," said Kull bluntly, resting
his chin upon his hand and fixing his sombre eyes upon the man's
face. "Can you do wonders?"</p>

<p>The wizard stretched forth his hand; his fingers opened and
closed like a bird's claws.</p>

<p>"Is that not a wonder&mdash;that this blind flesh obeys the
thoughts of my mind? I walk, I breathe, I speak&mdash;are they
not all wonders?"</p>

<p>Kull meditated awhile, then spoke. "Can you summon up
demons?"</p>

<p>"Aye. I can summon up a demon more savage than any in ghost
land&mdash;by smiting you in the face."</p>

<p>Kull started, then nodded. "But the dead, can you talk to the
dead?"</p>

<p>"I talk with the dead always&mdash;as I am talking now. Death
begins with birth, and each man begins to die when he is born;
even now you are dead, King Kull, because you were born."</p>

<p>"But you, you are older than men become; do wizards never
die?"</p>

<p>"Men die when their times come. No later, no sooner. Mine has
not come."</p>

<p>Kull turned these answers over in his mind.</p>

<p>"Then it would seem that the greatest wizard of Valusia is no
more than an ordinary man, and I have been duped in coming
here."</p>

<p>Tuzun Thune shook his head. "Men are but men, and the greatest
men are they who soonest learn the simpler things. Nay, look into
my mirrors, Kull."</p>

<p>The ceiling was a great many mirrors, and the walls were
mirrors, perfectly joined, yet many mirrors of many sizes and
shapes.</p>

<p>"Mirrors are the world, Kull," droned the wizard. "Gaze into
my mirrors and be wise."</p>

<p>Kull chose one at random and looked into it intently. The
mirrors upon the opposite wall were reflected there, reflecting
others, so that he seemed to be gazing down a long, luminous
corridor, formed by mirror behind mirror; and far down this
corridor moved a tiny figure. Kull looked long ere he saw that
the figure was the reflection of himself. He gazed and a queer
feeling of pettiness came over him; it seemed that that tiny
figure was the true Kull, representing the real proportions of
himself. So he moved away and stood before another.</p>

<p>"Look closely, Kull. That is the mirror of the past," he heard
the wizard say.</p>

<p>Gray fogs obscured the vision, great billows of mist, ever
heaving and changing like the ghost of a great river; through
these fogs Kull caught swift fleeting visions of horror and
strangeness; beasts and men moved there and shapes neither men
nor beasts; great exotic blossoms glowed through the grayness;
tall tropic trees towered high over reeking swamps, where
reptilian monsters wallowed, and bellowed; the sky was ghastly
with flying dragons, and the restless seas rocked and roared and
beat endlessly along the muddy beaches. Man was not, yet man was
the dream of the gods, and strange were the nightmare forms that
glided through the noisome jungles. Battle and onslaught were
there, and frightful love. Death was there, for Life and Death go
hand in hand. Across the slimy beaches of the world sounded the
bellowing of the monsters, and incredible shapes loomed through
the streaming curtain of the incessant rain.</p>

<p>"This is of the future."</p>

<p>Kull looked in silence.</p>

<p>"See you&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"A strange world," said Kull heavily. "The Seven Empires are
crumbled to dust and are forgotten. The restless green waves roar
for many a fathom above the eternal hills of Atlantis; the
mountains of Lemuria of the West are the islands of an unknown
sea. Strange savages roam the elder lands and new lands flung
strangely from the deeps, defiling the elder shrines. Valusia is
vanished and all the nations of today; they of tomorrow are
strangers. They know us not."</p>

<p>"Time strides onward," said Tuzun Thune calmly. "We live
today; what care we for tomorrow&mdash;or yesterday? The Wheel
turns and nations rise and fall; the world changes, and times
return to savagery to rise again through the long age. Ere
Atlantis was, Valusia was, and ere Valusia was, the Elder Nations
were. Aye, we, too, trampled the shoulders of lost tribes in our
advance. You, who have come from the green sea hills of Atlantis
to seize the ancient crown of Valusia, you think my tribe is old,
we who held these lands ere the Valusians came out of the East,
in the days before there were men in the sea lands. But men were
here when the Elder Tribes rode out of the waste lands, and men
before men, tribe before tribe. The nations pass and are
forgotten, for that is the destiny of man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kull. "Yet is it not a pity that the beauty and
glory of men should fade like smoke on a summer sea?"</p>

<p>"For what reason, since that is their destiny? I brood not
over the lost glories of my race, nor do I labor for races to
come. Live now, Kull, live now. The dead are dead; the unborn are
not. What matters men's forgetfulness of you when you have
forgotten yourself in the silent worlds of death? Gaze in my
mirrors and be wise."</p>

<p>Kull chose another mirror and gazed into it.</p>

<p>"That is the mirror of deepest magic; what see ye, Kull?"</p>

<p>"Naught but myself."</p>

<p>"Look closely, Kull; is it in truth you?"</p>

<p>Kull stared into the great mirror, and the image that was his
reflection returned his gaze.</p>

<p>"I come before this mirror," mused Kull, chin on fist, "and I
bring this man to life. That is beyond my understanding, since
first I saw him in the still waters of the lakes of Atlantis,
till I saw him again in the gold-rimmed mirrors of Valusia. He is
I, a shadow of myself, part of myself&mdash;I can bring him into
being or slay him at my will; yet&mdash;" He halted, strange
thoughts whispering through the vast dim recesses of his mind
like shadowy bats flying through a great cavern&mdash;"yet where
is he when I stand not in front of a mirror? May it be in man's
power thus lightly to form and destroy a shadow of life and
existence? How do I know that when I step back from the mirror he
vanishes into the void of Naught?</p>

<p>"Nay, by Valka, am I the man or is he? Which of us is the
ghost of the other? Mayhap these mirrors are but windows through
which we look into another world. Does he think the same of me?
Am I no more than a shadow, a reflection of himself&mdash;to him,
as he to me? And if I am the ghost, what sort of a world lives
upon the other side of this mirror? What armies ride there and
what kings rule? This world is all I know. Knowing naught of any
other, how can I judge? Surely there are green hills there and
booming seas and wide plains where men ride to battle. Tell me,
wizard who is wiser than most men, tell me are there worlds
beyond our worlds?"</p>

<p>"A man has eyes, let him see," answered the wizard. "Who would
see must first believe."</p>

<p><br>
THE hours drifted by, and Kull still sat before
the mirrors of Tuzun Thune, gazing into that which depicted
himself. Sometimes it seemed that he gazed upon hard shallowness;
at other times gigantic depths seemed to loom before him. Like
the surface of the sea was the mirror of Tuzun Thune; hard as the
sea in the sun's slanting beams, in the darkness of the stars,
when no eye can pierce her deeps; vast and mystic as the sea when
the sun smites her in such way that the watcher's breath is
caught at the glimpse of tremendous abysses. So was the mirror in
which Kull gazed.</p>

<p>At last the king rose with a sigh and took his departure still
wondering. And Kull came again to the House of a Thousand
Mirrors; day after day he came and sat for hours before the
mirror. The eyes looked out at him, identical with his; yet Kull
seemed to sense a difference&mdash;a reality that was not of him.
Hour upon hour he would stare with strange intensity into the
mirror; hour after hour the image gave back his gaze.</p>

<p>The business of the palace and of the council went neglected.
The people murmured; Kull's stallion stamped restlessly in his
stable, and Kull's warriors diced and argued aimlessly with one
another. Kull heeded not. At times he seemed on the point of
discovering some vast, unthinkable secret. He no longer thought
of the image in the mirror as a shadow of himself; the thing, to
him, was an entity, similar in outer appearance, yet basically as
far from Kull himself as the poles are far apart. The image, it
seemed to Kull, had an individuality apart from Kull's, he was no
more dependent on Kull than Kull was dependent on him. And day by
day Kull doubted in which world he really lived; was he the
shadow, summoned at will by the other? Did he instead of the
other live in a world of delusion, the shadow of the real
world?</p>

<p>Kull began to wish that he might enter the personality beyond
the mirror for a space, to see what might be seen; yet should he
manage to go beyond that door could he ever return? Would he find
a world identical with the one in which he moved? A world, of
which his was but a ghostly reflection? Which was reality and
which illusion?</p>

<p>At times Kull halted to wonder how such thoughts and dreams
had come to enter his mind, and at times he wondered if they came
of his own volition or&mdash;here his thoughts would become
mazed. His meditations were his own; no man ruled his thoughts,
and he would summon them at his pleasure; yet could he? Were they
not as bats, coming and going, not at his pleasure but at the
bidding or ruling of&mdash;of whom? The gods? The Women who wove
the webs of Fate? Kull could come to no conclusion, for at each
mental step he became more and more bewildered in a hazy fog of
illusory assertions and refutations. This much he knew: that
strange visions entered his mind, like flying unbidden from the
whispering void of non-existence; never had he thought these
thoughts, but now they ruled his mind, sleeping and waking, so
that he seemed to walk in a daze at times; and his sleep was
fraught with strange, monstrous dreams.</p>

<p>"Tell me, wizard," he said, sitting before the mirror, eyes
fixed intently upon his image, "how can I pass yon door? For of a
truth, I am not sure that that is the real world and this the
shadow; at least, that which I see must exist in some form."</p>

<p>"See and believe," droned the wizard. "Man must believe to
accomplish. Form is shadow, substance is illusion, materiality is
dream; man is because he believes he is; what is man but a dream
of the gods? Yet man can be that which he wishes to be; form and
substance, they are but shadows. The mind, the ego, the essence
of the god-dream&mdash;that is real, that is immortal. See and
believe, if you would accomplish, Kull."</p>

<p>The king did not fully understand; he never fully understood
the enigmatical utterances of the wizard; yet they struck
somewhere in his being a dim responsive chord. So day after day
he sat before the mirrors of Tuzun Thune. Ever the wizard lurked
behind him like a shadow.</p>

<p><br>
THEN came a day when Kull seemed to catch
glimpses of strange lands; there flitted across his consciousness
dim thoughts and recognitions. Day by day he had seemed to lose
touch with the world; all things had seemed each succeeding day
more ghostly and unreal; only the man in the mirror seemed like
reality. Now Kull seemed to be close to the doors of some
mightier worlds; giant vistas gleamed fleetingly; the fogs of
unreality thinned; "form is shadow, substance is illusion; they
are but shadows" sounded as if from some far country of his
consciousness. He remembered the wizard's words and it seemed to
him that now he almost understood&mdash;form and substance, could
not he change himself at will, if he knew the master key that
opened this door? What worlds within what worlds awaited the bold
explorer?</p>

<p>The man in the mirror seemed smiling at him closer,
closer&mdash;a fog enwrapped all and the reflection dimmed
suddenly&mdash;Kull knew a sensation of fading, of change, of
merging...</p>

<p>"Kull!" the yell split the silence into a million vibratory
fragments!</p>

<p>Mountains crashed and worlds tottered as Kull, hurled back by
the frantic shout, made a superhuman effort, how or why he did
not know.</p>

<p>A crash, and Kull stood in the room of Tuzun Thune before a
shattered mirror, mazed and half blind with bewilderment. There
before him lay the body of Tuzun Thune, whose time had come at
last, and above him stood Brule the Spear-slayer, sword dripping
red and eyes wide with a kind of horror.</p>

<p>"Valka!" swore the warrior. "Kull, it was time I came!"</p>

<p>"Aye, yet what happened?" The king groped for words.</p>

<p>"Ask this traitress," answered the Spear-slayer, indicating a
girl who crouched in terror before the king; Kull saw that it was
she who first sent him to Tuzun Thune. "As I came in I saw you
fading into yon mirror as smoke fades into the sky, by Valka! Had
I not seen I would not have believed; you had almost vanished
when my shout brought you back."</p>

<p>"Aye," muttered Kull, "I had almost gone beyond the door that
time."</p>

<p>"This fiend wrought most craftily," said Brule. "Kull, do you
not now see how he spun and flung over you a web of magic?
Kaanuub of Blaal plotted with this wizard to do away with you,
and this wench, a girl of the Elder Race, put the thought in your
mind so that you would come here. Ka-na of the council learned of
the plot today; I know not what you saw in that mirror, but with
it Tuzun Thune enthralled your soul and almost by his witchery he
changed your body to mist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye." Kull was still mazed. "But being a wizard, having
knowledge of all the ages and despising gold, glory, and
position, what could Kaanuub offer Tuzun Thune that would make of
him a foul traitor?"</p>

<p>"Gold, power, and position," grunted Brule. "The sooner you
learn that men are men whether wizard, king, or thrall, the
better you will rule, Kull. Now what of her?"</p>

<p>"Naught, Brule," as the girl whimpered and groveled at Kull's
feet. "She was but a tool. Rise, child, and go your ways; none
shall harm you."</p>

<p>Alone with Brule, Kull looked for the last time on the mirrors
of Tuzun Thune.</p>

<p>"Mayhap he plotted and conjured, Brule; nay, I doubt you not,
yet&mdash;was it his witchery that was changing me to thin mist,
or had I stumbled on a secret? Had you not brought me back, had I
faded in dissolution or had I found worlds beyond this?"</p>

<p>Brule stole a glance at the mirrors, and twitched his
shoulders as if he shuddered. "Aye, Tuzun Thune stored the wisdom
of all the hells here. Let us be gone, Kull, ere they bewitch me,
too."</p>

<p>"Let us go, then," answered Kull, and side by side they went
forth from the House of a Thousand Mirrors&mdash;where, mayhap,
are prisoned the souls of men.</p>

<p><br>
NONE look now in the mirrors of Tuzun Thune. The
pleasure boats shun the shore where stands the wizard's house,
and no one goes in the house or to the room where Tuzun Thune's
dried and withered carcass lies before the mirrors of illusion.
The place is shunned as a place accursed, and though it stands
for a thousand years to come, no footsteps shall echo there. Yet
Kull upon his throne meditates often upon the strange wisdom and
untold secrets hidden there and wonders...</p>

<p>For there are worlds beyond worlds, as Kull knows, and whether
the wizard bewitched him by words or by mesmerism, vistas did
open to the king's gaze beyond that strange door, and Kull is
less sure of reality since he gazed into the mirrors of Tuzun
Thune.</p>
