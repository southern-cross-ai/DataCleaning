<h1>The Fighting Fool</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Perley Poore Sheehan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>I</h2>

<p>He didn't know where he was. He'd almost forgotten that he was a
freeborn American---almost forgotten his name, he'd been called by so
many different names in so many different dialects.</p>

<p>THE way Shattuck slid around that rock would have done credit to a
fox. But, even as he did so, he knew that he was trapped. There was
no other cover near. The rock had concealed him from the camp he'd
been stalking. When he'd heard those voices from the rear his quick
shift of position meant he'd be seen from below.</p>

<p>The people in these hills had eyes like hawks--eyes like those of
their own hunting eagles.</p>

<p>In any case, he was out of rifle range from the camp. That lay
about a mile below, in a hidden little valley. He'd been looking at
it for the past two hours as he slowly approached it from above. In
the high thin air of the mountains the camp lay microscopic--it had
been like looking at it through the wrong end of a telescope,
everything minutely clear, but too microscopic to be studied.</p>

<p>And he had to study his moves--did Shattuck.</p>

<p>ALL he knew was that he was somewhere in the midriff of
Asia--Himalaya country---Pamirs--Hindu Kush; that one of those
gossamer billows of blue and white off there to the north might be
the Tien Shan--that is, the Heavenly Mountains, as the Chinese called
them.</p>

<p>In a general way, he was headed for China.</p>

<p>China to Shattuck almost meant the United States. He'd passed his
boyhood there--in Canton, Shanghai, Tientsin--where his father had
lived and traded.</p>

<p>NO other countries open to him at all! And perhaps not even China!
A man without a country! He had no papers, no relatives. He could
hardly think of a living soul who could link him up with his
past--who could actually swear that he was Pel Shattuck--Pelham
Rutledge Shattuck--and not some international tramp who'd merely
appropriated that name.</p>

<p>Like a wild animal caught in his dangerous position he blended
himself as best he could with the gravel and dead grass at the foot
of his rock and there lay completely still.</p>

<p>For a time the voices he had heard were stilled. He might have
been seen. Or the intruders might have spied some other game.</p>

<p>From where he lay, without other movement than that of his eyes,
Shattuck could view the camp--or the better part of it--through a
crotch of his sheepskin coat. No excitement yet!</p>

<p>Whatever happened, he'd have to go into some camp again pretty
soon anyway.</p>

<p>He wondered where he was--wondered who these people were.</p>

<p>THESE were some of the questions that had kept him on the scout
ever since running away from Juma's camp. The trouble with Juma's
camp was that Juma had a daughter, a girl named Mahree. And not even
a man who has got himself in bad with governments will do certain
things that a girl might propose.</p>

<p>"Khabadar!"--a voice near-by had spoken.</p>

<p>IT was a word of warning. It hadn't been addressed to himself. But
Shattuck knew that he'd been discovered.</p>

<p>His mind worked quickly. There was no friction even to thought in
the thin air of these high altitudes. Down in the camp just now he'd
seen a man staring up in his direction. He could guess the rest. The
man had signaled to the hunters on the mountain. ...</p>

<p>It wouldn't do to let them take him for a wolf or a bear.</p>

<p>Shattuck began to whine a bit of song that he'd learned in Juma's
camp--just a bar or two---then stopped short.</p>

<p>As if by accident he thrust his foxskin cap beyond the edge of the
rock. No shot was fired.</p>

<p>He left the cap where it was and took a look from the other side.
He saw four men--two of them elderly, with beards, and all of them
slant-eyed. The quartet were fanned out and had their rifles ready,
evidently in a maneuver to surround him.</p>

<p>"Let us drink tea," Shattuck offered, in one of the last phrases
he'd picked up in Juma's camp.</p>

<p>It was an invitation to a parley, an offer to talk--they'd get the
purport of it whether they understood his speech or not. He recovered
his cap. He stepped from behind his rock with his own rifle
ready.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" one of the bearded elders asked.</p>

<p>His language wasn't like the Kirghiz dialect of Juma's people, but
it was close enough to it to be understood.</p>

<p>"Ameriki," Shattuck answered.</p>

<p>He smiled and raised his right hand in salutation. He'd dropped
his rifle into the crook of his left arm but he'd be able to use it,
he guessed, if he had to.</p>

<p>The four stared. They were a wild looking lot, dressed in
sheepskin and felt. The two elders, those who were bearded, had their
left ears pierced and ornamented with large turquoise earrings. None
of them looked as if he'd been washed or had had his hair cut since
the day of his birth.</p>

<p>As for that, Shattuck felt that neither had he himself.</p>

<p>The four converged closely as Shattuck approached. There was an
air of tenseness about them that Shattuck didn't like. They were like
strange dogs closing in on a dog they'd selected for a kill.</p>

<p>In an instant Shattuck had swung his rifle back to ready again and
had them covered--ready to fire from the hip.</p>

<p>The movement was so swift that they were caught unprepared. He
gave them a quick survey, then addressed the elder who carried the
best weapon--that alone was enough to indicate he stood higher than
these others.</p>

<p>"Let the guns fall," he ordered. "Quickly! Then, maybe, we shall
talk like friends."</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>THERE is a sort of universal language, more of looks than of words
or gestures--the sort of communication that had already thrown
Shattuck on his guard. In the same way he could grasp the thought of
these four now as they let their weapons fall.</p>

<p>"Here is a mad fool! We'll get him later!"</p>

<p>Shattuck pushed the four guns into a pile with his foot. One was a
modern sporting rifle---English, he surmised. The others looked like
copies of older models--clumsy imitations, but effective enough, such
as might have been made in Lhassa or Kabul.</p>

<p>Even with his eyes down he surprised a movement from one of the
younger men.</p>

<p>The emergency was so sharp that Shattuck spoke up in English.</p>

<p>"Do you want to die?"</p>

<p>The young man had started to signal the camp in the valley. He'd
done so already, perhaps. With their telescopic eyes most of these
hill-men could flash signals or read them across amazing
distances.</p>

<p>There was a lull, then the leader of the four spoke up.</p>

<p>"Huzoor--"</p>

<p>THAT was vernacular, an address of respect; but the rest of it was
coming in English--as slowly, as creakingly, as a door forced open on
rusty hinges, but English.</p>

<p>"Excellence, we mean you no harm; and I take it that you mean us
no harm."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Your servant, Tsarong!"</p>

<p>The humility was too great to be sincere. Shattuck looked the old
man in the eye. The gaze that met his was veiled and shrewd.</p>

<p>"Who are your people?"</p>

<p>"Just a few poor Changpas."</p>

<p>Changpas! People from the Chan-tang!</p>

<p>As the meaning of this simple statement flashed into Shattuck's
mind it was all that he could do to suppress a start. Even so he
divined an answering start in the eyes of the old man.</p>

<p>The Changpas were Tibetans--the people of the tang, the desert
plains of Tibet's Far West. It was an affair of Tibet and Russia that
had got Shattuck into trouble with the Cheka, the Soviet Secret
Service.</p>

<p>Shattuck smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Father Tsarong," he invited; "and tell your friends to
sit down. Thus! You four sit down with your backs to the camp and
I'll sit here in front of you. Like that, should you see any other of
your people coming from behind me, you can signal them not to
shoot--as they might miss and shoot you instead."</p>

<p>Old man Tsarong hesitated.</p>

<p>"We are unworthy of that honor," he said. "Only our lord, the
general, is worthy such an honor."</p>

<p>"What you say is perfectly true," Shattuck replied. "Send for
him."</p>

<p>"Send for him! He is the governor of the entire Chantang!"</p>

<p>"Father, do as I say. Tell him you've met an earth demon who knows
everything. I know all about those Russian arms you've come to this
valley to get. Dorje-Pamo, the pig-faced goddess, told me about them
herself."</p>

<p>The old man was stricken.</p>

<p>He mumbled an order and the three others---including the other
elder himself--were for setting off together. But Shattuck stopped
the rush. Only one was to go, and he was to be the best runner among
them.</p>

<p>As the runner started off down the mountainside, Shattuck could
see that there was already some alarm in the camp. A string of yaks,
horses, sheep and goats had begun to straggle in from behind a
shoulder of the hill, driven by women and children.</p>

<p>"Are you not, then, English?" Tsarong asked.</p>

<p>"Ameriki," Shattuck replied.</p>

<p>HE could see that the word meant nothing to the Tibetans. To them
all white foreigners were English--that, or possibly Oross,
Russian.</p>

<p>`The three Tibetans sat in front of him and below him at a
respectful distance, facing him, their backs to the camp. Shattuck
also had folded his legs and seated himself on the ground, the four
surrendered rifles piled in front of him and his own weapon across
his knees.</p>

<p>The queer thought came to him that he was no longer an outcast and
a man without a country, after all. He was now as a king seated on a
throne.</p>

<p>The throne was a mountain. He had an arsenal. He had subjects who
looked at him with awe, speculating, like other subjects, on the
divinity of kings.</p>

<p>There was something about the vast panorama that surrounded him,
that stimulated this thought--stimulated it to the point of sheer
craziness. Yet, hereabouts, there were still legends of Alexander the
Great, of Ghengis Khan and Kubla Khan and Tamerlane.</p>

<p>There was a persistent legend that from this part of the world
would come the next great King of the World.</p>

<p>The three Tibetans were watching him. He was watching them.</p>

<p>"I am Pelham Rutledge Shattuck," he announced slowly.</p>

<p>He was making the announcement for himself as much as he was for
them. It sounded strange to hear his own name spoken like that, even
by his own voice, here in this Himalayan space. It was like some sort
of a mantram--a spell. The name went vibrating off into the blue of
Central Asia.</p>

<p>The Tibetans looked puzzled, even old Tsarong.</p>

<p>"Shattuck! Get that?"</p>

<p>There was a respectful murmur.</p>

<p>"Repeat it," Shattuck told them. "Shattuck!"</p>

<p>They tried it--first Tsarong, the linguist, then the others. They
also seemed to think that it was some sort of a spell.</p>

<p>"Sha-dak!" "Sha-dak!" "Sha-dak!"</p>

<p>It might have been a spell, at that. As they pronounced it the
name became a Chinese word meaning "trouble": Shadak.</p>

<p>They were repeating it with honorary titles added:</p>

<p>"Shadak-la!"</p>

<p>"Shadak-beg!"</p>

<p>"Shadak-khan!"</p>

<p>"My God," Shattuck muttered. "That's who I am, all right!"</p>

<p>In the silence of his thought it was as if an echo of silent
thunder had come rolling back upon him out of space, calling him by a
name to which he was fated:</p>

<p>"Captain Trouble!"</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>IT may have been what some would have called just a coincidence,
but as that new name of his vibrated in Shattuck's thought with a
queer sensation of something magical about it, a din broke out in the
camp below.</p>

<p>"Shadak!"</p>

<p>It sounded like trouble. It was a din of horns and gongs, drums, a
shouting. The whole camp, it seemed, dogs included, had begun to turn
out with its full capacity of noise.</p>

<p>Shattuck never winced. He'd become used to a lot of things since
his escape from the Cheka in Samarkand. He'd become used to a lot of
things before that.</p>

<p>He'd gone to Russia as a mining expert---especially as one who
spoke Chinese--expecting to be sent to Manchuria. Instead of that,
through some error, perhaps, he'd found himself switched to Bokhara.
The error, it turned out, was that he'd been falsely accused of
pro-Japanese activities. It was true that he'd lived in Japan for a
while.</p>

<p>In Samarkand he'd broken open some boxes which should have
contained some overdue mining machinery. The machinery turned out to
be machine-guns instead, and destined for Chantang.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it had become desirable that he leave the country. He
was on the Cheka's black list. He'd always wanted, anyway, to see
Afghanistan; and the devil was there in the person of a former Afghan
wazir, Michmander by name, to speed him on his way.</p>

<p>Michmander knew of certain lost mines in the Hindu-Kush. It was
knowledge that had to be kept, of course, from the thieving
government at Kabul, the Afghan capital.</p>

<p>Shattuck was willing.</p>

<p>HE stuck to Michmander in a trek that took them into mountains not
marked--except vaguely and incorrectly--on any map. And they'd had a
small army of cutthroats and all-round soldiers of fortune with them
before they were through--Shattuck himself the only white man in the
lot.</p>

<p>They'd penetrated to the depths of that great upheaval known as
"the Purdah Lady"--"K-2"---a mountain as veiled and as hard to get
to, that is, as a lady shut up in a harem.</p>

<p>And there they'd had a battle with wild natives who were armed
with spears and long-handled hatchets.</p>

<p>It was a great battle.</p>

<p>Shattuck had seen almost all of it. And he must have done his
share, for the last thing that Michmander--he who had led him into
this mess--ever said to him was to call him a fighting fool.</p>

<p>Michmander--having been exiled from Afghanistan long ago--had
passed enough time in America to have picked up some American
slang.</p>

<p>He was laughing as he said it, in the thick of the fight, and
trying to reload his automatic--a difficult job because he'd lost a
couple of fingers; and Shattuck himself was swaying on his feet and
covered with blood.</p>

<p>"You fighting fool!"</p>

<p>One of the few supreme compliments ever paid to any man; for, just
as Michmander said it, a long handled hatchet came swishing down and
split Michmander's head like a melon.</p>

<p>How the fight ended Shattuck didn't clearly know. Anyway, there
were parts of it that he was willing to forget.</p>

<p>But he had a vague idea that he'd lived for a while in a cave
where long ranks of stone gods a hundred feet high looked down on
small brown men bearing saucerlike lamps.</p>

<p>After that, there followed months--it might have been years so far
as he knew then--of wandering, always wandering and always amid
mountains.</p>

<p>When he emerged from this daze or trance it was to find he'd been
adopted by Juma, the Kirghiz chief, who was almost blind. He cured
Juma's blindness by simple cleanliness and an application of boracic
acid. He'd worked up the wash himself from borax he'd found in the
bed of a dry lake.</p>

<p>IN the meantime he'd found out that he had been barred from India.
The Government of India was taking no chances with tramps who'd
messed things up in both Russia and Afghanistan. Yet he might have
told those folks at Delhi about those boxed machine-guns had they let
him in.</p>

<p>Or again he might have stayed on with Juma. He liked the old man
and Juma had given him a rifle and ammunition, considerably more
valuable than their weight in gold.</p>

<p>But the girl Mahree--fifteen, slender, full-breasted, with eyes
like a fawns'--had broken an apricot in two and offered him half.</p>

<p>THE din from the camp had assumed something like order and
processional movement, swelling louder, coming nearer---horns and
gongs, clanging cymbals, that tumult of shouting. The voices of women
and children split through all this now and then with a shrill like
that of fifes.</p>

<p>There were, Shattuck judged, three or four hundred persons in the
mob. Most of the noise seemed to come from a solid phalanx of men in
the center. It wasn't long before he could see that these men were
roughly uniformed in long red robes. At first he thought that these
men were masked. But in a little while he could see that what he'd
taken to be masks were simply their own blackened faces.</p>

<p>Somewhere he'd read about those blackened faces--the fighting
monks of the Tibetan lamaseries. Even their name popped up. He
repeated it:</p>

<p>"Dok-dokpa!"</p>

<p>He kept his air of unconcern. But he decided that, at the first
show of battle, he'd seize old Father Tsarong over there, and hold
him as both shield and hostage.</p>

<p>"They have heard," said Tsarong, "what your presence has said
about Dorje-Pamo. They wish to honor the messenger of the Pig-Faced
Goddess."</p>

<p>It was simply stated, but it sounded like irony to Shattuck. He
had an idea that old Tsarong was not so simple as he would have it
appear. Nor could Tsarong have been so unimportant, either. The other
elder had placed himself slightly back of Tsarong. The beardless one
was frankly remote.</p>

<p>"Stand up and face them, Tsarong La," said Shattuck.</p>

<p>"Your presence--"</p>

<p>"Stand up and face them! Signal them to remain where they
are."</p>

<p>There was something besides blood that had begun to beat through
Shattuck's arteries. It was always that way when a fight
threatened---especially if it was apt to be a fight against
overwhelming odds. It was a sort of lulling warmth. It was as sweet
as a bugle call to a cavalry horse. It was a premonition. As Tsarong
still hesitated--pretending not to hear--pretending not to
understand--Shattuck saw a glint of something in the old man's eyes
that confirmed the premonition in his veins.</p>

<p>FROM where he sat, Shattuck jumped. It was a trick that Juma's
young fighting bucks had taught him. They'd be sitting crosslegged on
the ground--they might have been sitting like that for hours; and
then--presto!---they could fling themselves to right or left, or
forward or backward, as if their legs had been springs.</p>

<p>As Shattuck sprung, it was exactly as if a fragment of that
swelling din from down the hillside had detached itself and had
almost fallen upon him.</p>

<p>He came down crouching at the side of old Tsarong. As he did so he
whirled and fired without taking aim. An instant afterward--and
always afterward--it seemed to him that he must have seen what was
coming up behind him with some sort of eyes different from those in
the front of his head.</p>

<p>He'd as if seen that enemy sneaking upon him from behind.</p>

<p>Felt boots, red cloak, black face--it was a giant of a man, and
he'd been on the point of cutting down on him with one of the biggest
swords that Shattuck had ever seen.</p>

<p>The bullet from Shattuck's rifle had taken the giant through the
shoulder. He was twisted back and around like a big tree hit near the
top by lightning. The sword got a jerk that sent it spiraling like a
boomerang for a good twenty yards.</p>

<p>"You next?" grunted Shattuck.</p>

<p>And even while this was happening he had caught an arm about the
old man Tsarong's shoulders.</p>

<p>To Tsarong it must have been like an embrace from Death.</p>

<p>"Shadak--Shadak Khan!" Tsarong squeaked.</p>

<p>In the confusion of the moment the pronouncing of that name
reached Shattuck like a happy portent--a sure enough mantram.</p>

<p>He was aware that Tsarong wasn't the only one who'd pronounced
that name. So had that other elder--also perhaps the beardless boy.
The fact that they had joined in the cry--some intonation of horror
and pleading in their voices---gave Shattuck an idea.</p>

<p>"Ai-ya!" he laughed. "You thought to fool me, Old Man Tsarong.
Why, you're the Governor yourself!"</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>ALL this had taken place in full view of that mob of dokpas and
civilians coming up from the camp. They'd been coming pretty fast.
There'd been a crescendo to their racket culminating in a shriek and
clang that was like the explosion of a high-powered shell.</p>

<p>The Goliath of the sword was staggering around in a narrowing
circle like a dog looking for a place to lie down. Down he
went--coiled, then straightened out. He was summoning all that vast
strength of his to become a man again--become the hero he must have
felt himself when he'd swung up that big sword of his to kill an
earth demon, no less, and his whole tribe looking on.</p>

<p>It was a swift impression that Shattuck got---but detailed, one
apt to be lasting. That big face of his, shining with grease and
blacking, contorted with terror more than pain, was nothing
human.</p>

<p>THEN Shattuck saw that the big man had been merely the first of
several. There must have been a dozen swordsmen headed in his
direction.</p>

<p>In one respect, at any rate, his strategy had been correct. There
wasn't a single gun in sight. Tsarong must have seen to that.
Unwilling to take a chance on any dokpa marksmanship, he'd given his
order accordingly when he'd sent his runner back to the camp.</p>

<p>Shattuck, still embracing Tsarong, gave an order:</p>

<p>"Tell your swordsmen to retire--" The old man panted, but did not
speak, "--else I'll kill you before their eyes!"</p>

<p>"The victory is God's!" Tsarong panted---slowly,
fatalistically--in English. He raised his voice and shrilled
something in Tibetan.</p>

<p>Just an affair of seconds all this was---seconds that galloped
like horses in a race, but each horse of a second mounted by some
watchful jockey that recorded every move.</p>

<p>"You haven't answered me, Tsarong La," said Shattuck softly.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, O Shadak Khan, when you know all things?"</p>

<p>"It's you, the Governor of Chan-tang."</p>

<p>"I am but half the Governor, as you see, O Shadak Khan. The other
half is he who sat beside me. Each district has two governors."</p>

<p>Shattuck eyed the other bearded and earringed elder. He'd been
sitting there in a white trance.</p>

<p>"And what's your name?" Shattuck asked.</p>

<p>The old man merely gasped like a carp out of water. He wanted to
answer something. But he was afraid. He hadn't understood.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand even the language of heaven?" Shattuck asked
in his best Chinese.</p>

<p>"Kuan-hua!"</p>

<p>The stricken elder recovered himself in a gulp of amazement that
made him forget his fears.</p>

<p>"The Mandarin dialect," was what he meant.</p>

<p>"My lord speaks even the language of the Sons of Heaven!"</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, your lord, Old Uncle," Shattuck told him rapidly in
Chinese. "And make no mistake. I have proved it. I am a spirit merely
disguised as a Hairy Face. Which is the superior of you twain?"</p>

<p>"My brother, Tsarong, is the elder."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he speak the Kuan-hua?"</p>

<p>"Inadequately. While I went East, he went West."</p>

<p>"TELL Moon Face, here," said Shattuck, "to go get such help as is
needed to carry away this crippled dokpa. He is to be cared for
kindly."</p>

<p>Moon Face was sped on his way.</p>

<p>"And before he returns," Shattuck hurried on, "I'll tell you that
both of you old men are deserving death. But see! Instead of that,
here while all your people are looking on, I embrace you both. To him
who went West I speak the language of the West. To him that went East
I speak the language of the East. Who then, am I?"</p>

<p>"Verily, you are Shadak Khan!"</p>

<p>"I am Shadak Khan! I am Captain Trouble!"</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>"Have you not heard--hasn't the Dalai Lama himself heard--that a
new king is coming into the world? I am he! I've come to rule the
world for a while! My name is--Shadak Khan! My name is---Captain
Trouble!"</p>

<p>Something of this talk must have reached the crowd down the hill.
It may have done this partly through that curious intuition of
crowds---especially of crowds already incandescent and annealed by
excitement. Moon Face, the messenger, may have spread something of it
as he went down seeking help for the wounded man.</p>

<p>ADOZEN lamas not of the fighting sort but regular ge-longs--the
superior sort who'd had brains enough to pass their examinations, and
showing it in their faces--had responded to the call. The appearance
of them gave Shattuck another idea.</p>

<p>"And is there not one among these," he asked, "who speaks either
the language of the Chiling-ky-me?"--he'd put the question in
English, but he'd used the only Tibetan word he knew. It made a
pretty flourish.</p>

<p>Chiling-ky-me!</p>

<p>Old Juma had taught him that word. For Juma had conducted robber
raids off and on into pretty nearly every section of the high
country, even into Tibet. The word meant foreigners--that is, the
English.</p>

<p>Before old Tsarong could pull himself together to answer Shattuck,
it was another's voice who answered in English:</p>

<p>"Sir, my--father--"</p>

<p>Shattuck, just at the sound of that voice, felt a tingling thrill,
he didn't know why. He didn't have time to ask. He'd raised his eyes
and had seen the speaker--a lean face and a shaven head that might
have belonged to some young Roman general. Even his tattered robe of
a Tibetan lama might have been a toga.</p>

<p>The voice was forcing a calm that the brilliant eyes belied.</p>

<p>"Sir, my--father--was--American!"</p>

<p>IT was Shattuck's turn to exert all his will at self-control. The
other lamas were staring. So were the two old governors. Shattuck
could feel that they were. But he kept his eyes on that soberly
flashing face of the young lama who'd spoken.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said, "what is your name?"</p>

<p>"My Tibetan name is Champela."</p>

<p>"You have another?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"John Day."</p>

<p>It had been his father's name, this young lama explained. His
father had been a geologist who'd married his own Lalla Rookh in the
Vale of Cashmere. They'd both been killed by an avalanche in that
gorge called by the Tibetans "the Four Devil Pass."</p>

<p>It was also Champela himself who referred to his mother as Lalla
Rookh. He'd read the poem as a boy.</p>

<p>"So did I," said Shattuck.</p>

<p>To Shattuck, after his months of exile, it was as if he'd stumbled
onto a lamasery here in the heart of Asia floating the American
flag.</p>

<p>While the other lamas carried the wounded black-face away,
Shattuck deserted the two old governors and drew Champela aside.</p>

<p>"John Day," he said, "are you free?"</p>

<p>Champela reflected.</p>

<p>"As free as you are, Shadak Khan," he replied.</p>

<p>Shattuck let the title ride. There'd been no hint of mockery in
it. If anything, there'd been something just the opposite. It was as
if the title had been confirmed by a prophet.</p>

<p>"You're not held by any vows?"</p>

<p>"None but those I have made to myself."</p>

<p>"No chief lama is your master?"</p>

<p>"Not even the Dalai Lama himself, Shadak Khan."</p>

<p>"Why don't you call me by my right name, John Day?"</p>

<p>"I believe that I am calling you by your right name, Shadak Khan.
Your coming has been predicted since a thousand years--since twice a
thousand years--"</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"A scourge of God, perhaps--a Shadak Khan--a Captain Trouble. He
has a thousand names. But so has the sun. So has Maitreya--He Who
Will Come--"</p>

<p>They were standing there on the high slope of what has been called
the Roof of the World. The sun was going down. And with one of those
sudden transformations of light so common in mountain country the
snow peaks had turned to flaming gold.</p>

<p>"You be my prime minister, John Day," said Shattuck.</p>

<p>He'd still intended his proposal, even then, to sound something
like a joke. But it didn't sound like a joke at all. It was as if the
very mountains were celebrating the event. This was something that
had been predicted since, twice a thousand years.</p>

<p>"I'll be your prime minister," Champela told him.</p>

<p>"Shake!"</p>

<p>THE young lama might not have caught the meaning of the word in
that particular sense, but he was quick enough to understand the
extended hand.</p>

<p>"Now I'm not free," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither am I."</p>

<p>"No man is free from his destiny--and this, our meeting, also was
predestined--perhaps since the beginning of the world."</p>

<p>There was a barbecue in the little valley of the camp that night,
though not in the American style. The Tibetans like to eat their meat
boiled---or raw; washed down with gallons of tea and rancid butter,
or chang, the beer of the country, and arrak, a whisky distilled from
the beer.</p>

<p>The dung fires seethed and spit blue flames.</p>

<p>There was singing, dancing and fights, before it was fairly
dark.</p>

<p>The people were celebrating the advent of Shadak Khan. They
weren't quite sure yet just what this signified. But it had something
to do with Dorje-Pamo, the Pig-Faced Goddess. They knew that much.
And that was enough. The way to please old Dorje-Pamo was to gorge
and souse, brawl and make love. . . .</p>

<p>But John Day, prime minister of Shadak Khan, wouldn't let Shattuck
partake of the feast---not even as a guest of the governors.</p>

<p>"They'll fill you with aconite," he said, "you'd be dead before
dawn."</p>

<p>Most Tibetans were ardent poisoners in times of great
emergency.</p>

<p>There was an early moon. In its ghostly light a cavalcade of
ponies left the scene of the camp and wound its way further up the
valley.</p>

<p>Shattuck was in the midst of it, in the place of greatest safety
and honor. Those in front and those following, so far as he could
see, were white lamas like Champela.</p>

<p>IN the moonlight it was hard to think of Champela as John Day,
American. For that matter, Shattuck found it hard to think of himself
as himself. He was something else--something bigger than
himself--something predestined since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>Shadak Khan!</p>

<p>Captain Trouble!</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>BY the light of this same moon a caravan of more than three
hundred camels came padding back into this same secret valley from
the outlying desert. Unknown to Shattuck it was this caravan for
which the warring Tibetans had been waiting.</p>

<p>The camel-bells made music in the night. It was a rhythmic music
to which the swishing feet of the stock kept time like the feet of
tireless dancers. It would have been hard to find a better equipped
or a better conducted caravan anywhere.</p>

<p>Every man was armed. Even the camel--pullers were armed.</p>

<p>Any old caravan man would have spotted the sort of caravan this
was without looking twice.</p>

<p>"T'u fang-tze!"</p>

<p>Opium-runners! Caravans like this brought the precious "white
opium" of Persia through the Gobi to all points east. But even an old
Gobi man might have been puzzled by the loads and the haste of this
present caravan if not by the trails it followed.</p>

<p>No opium-train ever followed the regular roads anyway.</p>

<p>But these camels were carrying full loads---compact and strongly
boxed. Arms! That would be sure. But the trail could lead nowhere
except back into the wild and thinly populated Chantang country of
Tibet's Far West.</p>

<p>Along a smooth bit of going the owner of the outfit, mounted on a
nimble black pony, drew alongside of his caravan-master, who was
riding half asleep and half awake on the pick of the camels. The
relations of owner and master were about like those of owner and
captain on a ship at sea.</p>

<p>They were speaking Mongolian, a language that had been largely
developed in desert places. Their voices were no louder than the
occasional bubbling of the camel the caravan-master rode.</p>

<p>"We'll soon arrive at the turn-off of the Thorny Well Trail, Big
Man," the owner of the outfit said.</p>

<p>"What of it, Duke?"</p>

<p>"It is a short way and a safe way."</p>

<p>"To where we're going?"</p>

<p>"No, Big Man, to Kansu."</p>

<p>"We're not going to Kansu, Duke. We're going to the Lesser Valley
of the Soaring Meditation."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking about how much more money these arms would
bring in China than they would in Tibet."</p>

<p>The caravan-master yawned and belched.</p>

<p>"Big Man, I mean it."</p>

<p>"Mean what?"</p>

<p>"The difference in price would enrich us both. General Hokwa is in
Kansu with all the gold he collected during his last campaign."</p>

<p>"May it give him inflammation of the bowels!"</p>

<p>"But Kansu needs these machine-guns. Tibet doesn't."</p>

<p>"Search me!" groaned Big Man, or words to that effect.</p>

<p>HE dropped his head on his chest and pretended to be sleeping
again. The owner of the outfit still ambled on at his side.</p>

<p>"Big Man," he said, "when they've got you back there in the hills,
how do you know that those louse-breeding Tibetans are going to pay
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"They'll pay first or they don't get the arms."</p>

<p>"They may take them anyway."</p>

<p>"From this bunch? Don't make me laugh? This bunch? I haven't got a
man in my string who hasn't been slitting throats for the past ten
years! We're a bunch of fighting wildcats."</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>"WE'LL need a fighting-man like you," said the old abbot, as
Shattuck stood before him.</p>

<p>John Day translated the Tibetan into perfect English.</p>

<p>"They are bringing fighting-machines into the Little Valley," the
abbot went on in a whispering monotone, "and they that bring the
machines are fighting men."</p>

<p>The abbot was very old. His eyes were so glazed that they appeared
to be sightless. He seemed to be talking in his sleep about things
that he saw in his sleep.</p>

<p>He sat cross-legged on a cushioned bench back of a carved teakwood
table. On the table were a covered teacup and a bell. The table was
like an altar. When the abbot was silent he sat so still it was easy
to imagine that he was an image in a temple.</p>

<p>He was silent for a long time, then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"The spirit of revolution has entered Tibet. There are foolish men
planning to put a king in the place of the Dalai Lama."</p>

<p>John Day translated. He saw that Shattuck was about to ask a
question, but he raised a warning hand.</p>

<p>It was as if the movement had struck a spark of life from the
image presented by the abbot. What he said was:</p>

<p>"I will answer your question, Captain Trouble."</p>

<p>And Shattuck knew then beyond all doubt---as he'd already been
prepared to believe--that he was in the presence of an authentic
Bogdo--a Living Buddha. Although the old seer continued to speak in
Tibetan it was as if a skillful painter were now casting up a picture
on some invisible canvas of the air.</p>

<p>"Along toward the next peak-shining time"---and Shattuck could see
the light of the rising sun along a mountain-crest while it was still
night in the valleys. "--they will arrive at the narrow place of this
valley of ours called the Jaws of the Wolf."</p>

<p>Shattuck would recognize that narrow gorge when he saw it--he
would recognize it from what he was seeing now.</p>

<p>SEVERAL times the Bogdo seemed to be on the point of speech again,
and each time that he did so Shattuck caught some fleeting vision in
which the movement and the figures were confused by a red mist. Each
time when the red mist was shaping itself into something definite,
the Bogdo made an erasing gesture in front of him with his slender
hand and the unformed picture disappeared.</p>

<p>Finally he murmured two words, which John Day translated:</p>

<p>"Acquire merit!"</p>

<p>The Bogdo reached out and touched his teacup as if he were about
to drink. It was a ceremonial gesture meaning that the audience was
ended. . . .</p>

<p>The Soaring Meditation Lamasery of the Lesser Valley--as the place
was known--was like a series of setback houses against a steep
mountain slope. As Shattuck and his new prime minister came out on an
upper terrace they both could tell by the stars that the night was
already far gone.</p>

<p>"It is time that I hit the road," said Shattuck.</p>

<p>"Pel--Captain--"</p>

<p>"Make it Pel."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you."</p>

<p>"YOU'RE not. I'm Captain Trouble. I'm even the Fighting Fool. I
saw a blood-red mist when the Bogdo talked. You're not a man of
blood."</p>

<p>"The camp is debauched and drunk. You'll have no one to help
you."</p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>"You can't go alone. These are gunrunners--all fighting men."</p>

<p>"His holiness, the Bogdo, saw me fighting them there alone. So did
I. That's why he mentioned that place where one man can turn them
back. Is there a horse in the stables with a chestnut coat and a
white mane?"</p>

<p>"Torang! The abbot's own! If he showed him to you in the vision he
meant you to have him."</p>

<p>For an interval John Day closed his eyes. During that interval he
had become Champela, the mystic desciple of Buddha again. He opened
his eyes with a changed expression.</p>

<p>"I have just received a message myself from the Bogdo," he
said.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure myself. Follow me."</p>

<p>They went down a dozen flights of steps as narrow and as steep, as
ladders. Most of the time they were in almost complete darkness. Only
here and there a butter-lamp burned.</p>

<p>They came into a dusky temple room and there, without hesitation,
Champela, again the mystic, went over to where a monumental statue of
Buddha reared its height and breadth into the shadows from a
breast-high platform. The front of this platform Champela raised like
the lid of a coffer. Into this receptacle he stood gazing for a few
seconds with a rapt attention.</p>

<p>Then he drew out a long object swathed in fold after fold of
silk.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Shattuck whispered.</p>

<p>The young lama also whispered, but his voice was thrilling.</p>

<p>"Something else the Bogdo is sending you---the sword of Kubla
Khan!"</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>WHEN Chief Juma awoke to the fact that his adopted son, Dak (the
nearest he'd ever got to Shattuck) had put the wind between them he
was very disconsolate.</p>

<p>Like many another hillman, nature had been generous to him in the
matter of height. He was all of six feet seven in his well-worn
chaplies, the sandals he stuck to in winter as in summer. And
physically he was as tough as a bundle of rattan. But he was at an
age when he was prone to go over and over the same story time and
again.</p>

<p>And now that "Dak" was gone, he was worse than ever in this
respect. Formerly he'd had a number of favorite stories--how he'd
killed this or that blood enemy, how he'd robbed whole caravans
single-handed.</p>

<p>But now he could think of only that one story.</p>

<p>He'd come on this crazy young sahib (Shattuck) back in the hills
being more or less neglected by some roaming Kazaks. After all, even
Kazaks may treat a crazy man no worse than a dog. And he was about to
pass up the incident when, by mere chance, he learned from a renegade
Afghan the sort of battle the lad had put up against great odds while
trying to raid a government gold mine.</p>

<p>Thereupon, in the hope of merit in heaven and also, perhaps, a few
honest rupees from the sahibs to whom this lad evidently belonged,
he'd sought to turn "Dak" over to the English. But the cow-eaters
wouldn't have him at any price.</p>

<p>He'd done something that had made him skip out of the country of
the Oross, the English had said. Then he'd got into this battle in
Kafiristan.</p>

<p>After that, Juma wouldn't have parted with the boy anyway--not at
any price. He'd nurtured the lad like his own child; He'd spent a
year's income on prayers and medicines for him. As a result, the boy
came out of his dream. And having come out of his dream he'd put the
healing touch on Juma's own eye-trouble.</p>

<p>JUMA couldn't understand it. They'd loved each other like father
and son. Why had "Dak" put the wind between them?</p>

<p>And so it went on and on, day after day. Until the mother of the
girl Mahree came and told Juma the tale she'd learned from Mahree
herself.</p>

<p>"Now, by Allah and all the fiends of Gehenna," said Juma, "had Dak
but whispered it to me I'd given him the girl as readily as I would
have given him anything else I won. Didn't he restore my sight?"</p>

<p>After that, he kept his band on the move. He was looking for
"Dak." Over high passes and into valleys he'd almost forgotten, into
villages where there were unsettled blood-claims against him, into
forbidden temples and lamaseries--there was no place where Juma
wouldn't go in the pursuit of that strange search of his.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Mahree was getting older. Also she was
gaining in beauty. He'd never gone in for purdah nonsense. He was
able to take care of his women. But he'd have to wrap the girl up in
a burgua at that, if he wanted to keep her for "Dak." He was getting
higher and higher offers for her all he time.</p>

<p>Then, one day, Juma came on a fakir sitting naked on a glacier.
And the devout neighbors assured Juma that the holy man had sat like
that, unmoving since the last new moon. That meant the fakir had
suffered killing frost for more than ten days. Yet he showed not the
slightest ill affects from it. The man was holy.</p>

<p>When Juma went to see him, the holy man came out of his period of
meditation and said:</p>

<p>"He whom you call your son is near death."</p>

<p>Juma said: "Sick?"</p>

<p>"No! In bloody battle!"</p>

<p>"Praise God, at least for that," said Juma. "Where?"</p>

<p>"I see--wait!--a lamasery in a little valley---a cleft between two
hills--and there thy son is as one against a hundred--"</p>

<p>The sadhu stopped as if he'd never spoken at all.</p>

<p>"Where?" screamed Juma. "Or I'll tear you--"</p>

<p>The sadhu looked up at him unmoved. And Juma, for the first time
in his life, began to quaver.</p>

<p>"Where, O holy one? See, I am getting old!"</p>

<p>The holy one looked at him with compassion. He made a forward
movement with his hand to indicate a direction.</p>

<p>"That way--until the sun goes down!"</p>

<p>JUMA turned and strode away as he stood. He didn't have his gun.
He hadn't dared carry it into the presence of the holy one as he'd
wanted to be sure of having his questions answered. But he had his
knife. And the hills were rich in rocks of throwing and hammering
size.</p>

<p>He'd covered a mile before he discovered that he was followed. It
was that curse of a female, the cause of it all, the girl Mahree.</p>

<p>He tried to drive her back.</p>

<p>But to his amazement and her own, she defied him.</p>

<p>"Since when," she shrilled, "is a woman forbidden to fight for her
man?"</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>WITH Torang between his knees and the sword of Kubla Khan held
close to his breast Shadak Khan, Captain Trouble, the Fighting Fool,
was off to fight he didn't know exactly what.</p>

<p>Long ago he had known someone called Pelham--Rutledge--Shattuck.
The name kept time to Torang's swift but easy lope.
Pelham---Rutledge--Shattuck---</p>

<p>But it wasn't he--it wasn't he--who'd sat on a mountain throne and
looked into the eyes of his subjects. It wasn't he who'd stood in the
presence of a reincarnated Buddha and heard his fortune told. It
wasn't he who rode an abbot's horse down a long dark valley with the
sword of a great warlord against his breast.</p>

<p>No, those were pages from the life of Shadak Khan--Captain
Trouble--Fighting Fool---</p>

<p>There came to the reincarnation who was himself the sharp pang of
a realizing thought. The thought was this--that he might be riding to
his death. He remembered the red mist--the half-seen astral pictures
that the Bogdo had wiped away with his slender white hand, the old
man's final words:</p>

<p>"Acquire merit!"</p>

<p>How? If death was the way, he'd take his chance!</p>

<p>He looked up just in time to see a meteor slide across the sky. It
wouldn't be so bad to go like that.</p>

<p>He felt a sense of elation. It was as if the sword against his
breast were coming to life---taking on a warmth of its own. It had no
scabbard. The blade was a long strong scimitar, yet so exquisitely
balanced to the hilt it could be handled like a wand.</p>

<p>He flashed it about his head. It sang.</p>

<p>To that faint note Torang let out a link or two of speed. In this
light the gelding's dark body was invisible. His white mane and tail
glinted along like a pair of detached specters.</p>

<p>It was this dash of white in the dark that had given the horse his
name. Torang!--the first glint of daybreak; a high cloud shining
white while the earth was dark.</p>

<p>There was a cloud like that hanging over the easterly summits when
Shattuck passed the camp where, last night, the two old governors
would have given him aconite. He spat in their direction. IT was a
gesture as much for all their gorging, guzzling, lecherous herd of
human swine as it was for them. And these were the men who'd barter
for a revolution!</p>

<p>Before you could revolute a land you had to revolute yourself!</p>

<p>So said the heir to the blade of Kubla Khan.</p>

<p>The thought was still with him when the valley suddenly twisted
and went into a corridor like that of some overwhelming ruin. He was
at the very lips of the wolf's open jaws.</p>

<p>He didn't know how to pray but some instinct was telling him that
the moment was solemn and that he ought to do something.</p>

<p>He reined in Torang, with a swift hand. He raised the sword of the
great khan Kubla straight up above his head. His head went down. For
a moment he was thinking of the strange John Day.</p>

<p>"I sure would be glad to be good enough," he whispered, "to have
him not as a prime minister---you're crazy!--but merely as a
friend."</p>

<p>A moment later he was stirred from his reverie by some faint spasm
of nervous excitement that ran through Torang's lithe frame. It was
like a faint current of electricity, a silent telephone call. Torang
had arched his neck. His slender ears were focusing on a distant
sound.</p>

<p>A moment later, Shattuck was hearing the sound himself--the faint,
far-off clink and clank of camel bells.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p>THE gorge of "The Wolf"--literally the throat--ran between
towering cliffs for a twisted mile, and pretty bad going all the way.
After the primordial earthquake had riven the mountains apart, a
stream--or recurrent streams---had scoured out the bottom, leaving a
debris of footless boulders, causing a cave-in here and a dike there
and a pit like an elephant trap somewhere else.</p>

<p>The caravan-master knew all this. He had been through the gorge
time and again before. It used to be part of the regular opium route
until the old Bogdo of the Soaring Meditation Lamasery put an end to
it.</p>

<p>The Bogdo was known to have great powers. Otherwise he would have
"taken the aconite" a long time ago. There had often been talk among
the caravan-master and his band that they could raid the lamasery and
make their fortunes at it.</p>

<p>The place was isolated. There wasn't a drunken, brawling,
dok-dokpa about the place---not a fighting man of any kind. And it
was generally known that into the mountain back of every monastery
the treasure caves were being dug deeper and deeper every year. That
sort of thing had been going on for centuries. The treasure of even a
rundown old lamasery like that of the Soaring Meditation would be
enough to buy Japan.</p>

<p>But they'd never tried to make a raid. They didn't dare. The Bogdo
had a reputation of being in league with certain ghosts.</p>

<p>It was that matter of ghosts as much as the uncertain footing of
the gorge that had caused the caravan-master--a pastmaster in timing,
like all good smugglers--to bring his weary train to the outer mouth
of the gorge just at the "peak-shining" hour.</p>

<p>No more ghosts after peak-shining. And there would be light
enough, although night got clogged in the narrow defile and stuck
there like a fog until late morning.</p>

<p>He didn't dare halt now, even for a minute. Camels were peculiar
creatures. You could keep them going and going--as he had this
time---</p>

<p>"Kwa-chi-cheng!"</p>

<p>ONE forced march on top of another. But let up on them, after a
race like that, and the beasts would flop down and die in their
tracks. Besides, inside the valley there were good grazing and water.
Outside, there was none.</p>

<p>Still in the lead and only half awake the caravan-master pushed on
into the gorge. He'd scarcely entered it before there was a
clattering of hoofs and he saw a lone horseman in the shadows
ahead.</p>

<p>From the moment the caravan-master saw this man he felt the
approach of trouble--a dark horse with a white mane and tail. Then,
to a sharp increase of his trouble, he saw that the man in front of
him was unquestionably white.</p>

<p>The man came ambling toward him at a good swift track and didn't
stop or speak until the caravan-master's own camel stopped.</p>

<p>"I know you," said the man on the horse. His Chinese was that of
Pechili, with a good snap to it. "You're Wong Tajen." It was as if to
say, "Wong the Big Man."</p>

<p>Wong was beginning to simmer.</p>

<p>"This is no place to halt my caravan," he said.</p>

<p>He guessed the fellow might be a Russian. He'd heard about big
fights between opposing clans of the Oross beyond the Gobi.</p>

<p>"I'm halting it, Big Man."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me from a camel. Dismount!"</p>

<p>Big Man's ears were picking up tell-tale sounds from back of him
as squad after squad of camels came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Dismount and send your camel ahead or all the camels will be
lying down on you. You know that, Fathead."</p>

<p>Wong did know it. He'd been handling camels for the better part of
thirty years. But not for twenty years had anyone dared call him
ta-tou, "fathead," except a fresh tax-collector whom later he'd
slowly killed.</p>

<p>WITH a curse and grunt he rolled himself from the riding camel he
was on. The beast was already smelling grass and water and lurched
ahead. The camel that followed also lurched. As it did so, something
amazing happened. It shed its load--one heavy box to either side.</p>

<p>A sword had flashed across the pack rope--a mere swish, and the
rope had parted.</p>

<p>Even while Wong was rolling from his camel he'd found the grip of
the revolver he carried in the breast of his sheepskin coat. He got
that far when he stopped to think. This man might have an army back
of him. Already two camels were past--his favorite of all the camels
he'd ever slept on, leading the way.</p>

<p>The thought meant hesitation; the hesitation lost him his chance
and two other camels. Two other loads had crashed down.</p>

<p>"Hands up and face the rock, you!"--this fellow spoke like no
Russian.</p>

<p>There was a needle of steel against Wong's neck.</p>

<p>Wong's nerves were tuned to small things. In that needlepoint
against his neck he could detect not the slightest quaver--no
skipping, no torture.</p>

<p>His hands were up. His face was to the rock.</p>

<p>There were shocks of falling boxes, the grunt and scramble and
heave of camels becoming frenzied by a prospect of camel heaven after
a long, hard drag through camel hell.</p>

<p>And the fellow kept talking all the time---slanging the camel
pullers and laughing at them; he was driving them back along the
gorge as fast as he slit the lashings of the heavy freight. "Hey,
you, Big Man! Why don't you ask me who I am?"</p>

<p>"Who?"--and Wong dared to turn.</p>

<p>"Hands still up, or I'll slit your throat as you did the widow's
in the Traveling Sands!"</p>

<p>THAT was the most secret murder that Wong had ever done. His eyes
were beginning to pop. The man leaned down from his horse---Torang
wasn't very tall--and found with his left hand the pistol in Wong's
breast. Wong felt a faint breath of courage when the white devil
searched no further--else he'd found a second pistol lower down.</p>

<p>"Who are you, duke?" Wong asked placatingly.</p>

<p>"Not 'duke,' kahn!" He stopped to sever the ropes on two more
camels and Wong had snatched his second pistol higher. "Shadak
Kahn!--all same Captain Trouble. You savvy, Captain Trouble?"</p>

<p>Shadak Khan turned to yell at a camel puller who was trying to
stop a camel by the nose-rope. The camel-puller was either stupid or
deaf. He raised apologetic frightened eyes to the horse-riding duke
and pulled harder than ever.</p>

<p>At that instant there was a crashing report--it sounded like a
hand-grenade, there in the rocky confines of the gorge.</p>

<p>Shattuck felt a blaze of heat at his side as if his coat had
caught on fire. But before he'd take note of this--more swiftly than
Wong the Big Man could fire his Number Two gun a second
time--Shattuck lunged. Like a thing alive and self-directed the sword
of Kubla Khan slit the Big Man's throat.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p>TIBETANS are early risers. Their climate has made them so. Late
night fsand morning hold about the only golden hours they ever know.
Along about midday the horrible wind comes up--the buran, the hideous
dry gale that blows stronger and stronger under a blanched and
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>As often as not the people of Tibet will be up and about well
before daylight even after a night of debauch.</p>

<p>It was so this morning in the little valley, in the camp of the
two old governors, Tsarong and his brother. Then the black-faced
fighting lamas where thirsty and on the prowl for fresh adventure so
early--or so late--that there had practically, been no night for them
at all. And the dokpas were the first to note that queer invasion of
camels from the Throat of the Wolf. They were a superstitious lot,
those dokpas--none more so, since to each of them had come, some time
or other, manifestations of powers they could not understand.</p>

<p>These blubbering, crazed, and naked camels rocking into the valley
like so many camel ghosts, and something really terrifying about
them.</p>

<p>The governors were roused.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time the whole camp was up and active.
These were livestock people---more used to yaks than camels, but
recognizing in this stampeded herd more value than a century of goats
would ever bring.</p>

<p>OLD Tsarong wasn't long in putting two and two together.</p>

<p>This was the munition train they'd come to meet. Something had
happened to it. But what? Where were the men? Where was the
freight?</p>

<p>Through the thin air of daybreak they heard that distant revolver
shot. After that, there were the muted staccato barkings of a
small-arms battle.</p>

<p>While the governors were still shouting conflicting orders, a
special shout went up and the people fell aside as if tossed by an
invisible plow and through this furrow--beautiful as a dream-horse
and as elusive--they saw the horse of the Bogdo go trotting by.</p>

<p>"Torang!"</p>

<p>Torang they believed to be as holy as its master. They saw it
saddled but riderless, unblemished, uncannily wise when it came to
its keeping on its way. Wasn't it likely that it was ridden by a
ghost?</p>

<p>It had come very close to that.</p>

<p>In less than a minute after Wong had fired---and died--Shattuck
recognized that this was no place for an abbot's horse--or any horse.
He had an overwhelming gust of pity for all horses, camels, dogs--and
men! These men had fought the Gobi until they were as cruel as the
Gobi itself! He'd sent Torang home.</p>

<p>This wasn't a chain of reasoning.</p>

<p>His reasoning all went into the fight--clear, precise, perceptive
with a thousand eyes only opened in times like these.</p>

<p>Still with that revolver he'd taken from Wong in his left hand and
the great scimitar in his right, he plunged on further into the
pass.</p>

<p>Already the place of his first stand was being choked with cast
boxes, and blue steel brought a flash of clairvoyant memory. He'd
seen these self-same boxes, and at least a part of what was in them,
back in Samarkand.</p>

<p>He cut more pack ropes and dodged. Camels slipped and straddled
and disappeared. Horses were being kicked forward by hard-faced
Mongols.</p>

<p>Shattuck would remember those faces. When the world needed
fighters, these were fighters. But they'd have to be led, bled,
crucified, to be taught the things they'd known before when they
conquered half the world.</p>

<p>ONE was poking a gun in his face when Shattuck dodged under the
horse's belly and cut the gunman down from the other side. An instant
later he'd fired his first shot and had seen the horse jump from
under its rider as if the fellow had been roped.</p>

<p>The confusion saved him a dozen, a score of times.</p>

<p>"Back!" he shouted. "Or you'll all be killed!"</p>

<p>"Ya-ming!"</p>

<p>That was shorter: "Sure death!"</p>

<p>Some of the riders were trying to turn back to regain the
desert.</p>

<p>Camels were retching, moaning, grinding their teeth. Some thudded
to a fall and squealed as panic wrenched them to their feet
again.</p>

<p>A sudden weakness blew a breath over Shattuck. It was like the
first whiff of the anaesthetic before an operation. But he felt no
pain.</p>

<p>He gathered his nerves to a tighter pitch.</p>

<p>"Ya-ming!"</p>

<p>"And that means you," a calm voice echoed in his brain.</p>

<p>"Let me do this first," his thought replied.</p>

<p>He was drawing the great blade across another pack-tie when a
Mongol struck down at him with the loaded butt of a whip.</p>

<p>At the same moment Shattuck fired.</p>

<p>Bullet and bludgeon both went home.</p>

<p>"I'm taking him with me," was the Fighting Fool's last
thought.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p>ABUNCH of the dokpas--faces black with grease and their dank hair
making them look like devils on a frolic--were looting what they
could find in the Throat of the Wolf.</p>

<p>They screeched and laughed. They stripped the dead and kicked the
dying, leaving a number of naked and humiliated corpses in their
wake.</p>

<p>Then they made the one gorgeous and outstanding discovery of the
morning. They'd not only found the white devil of the preceding
day---he who had called himself Shadak Khan--but leaning over him,
trying to lift him, trying to recall him to life, one of the most
beautiful female creatures they had ever seen.</p>

<p>They'd all heard legends about the Kashmiri maidens. They told
filthy stories of their own invention about their affairs with such.
They vaunted of local conquests that had Kashmiri conquests beaten a
mile.</p>

<p>But here was the real thing. So they believed. Anyway, it was the
first of her species any of them had ever seen. They crowded toward
her and the white man like a pack of wolves at a spent doe.</p>

<p>Mahree was no spent doe, though, even if she had traveled for one
full day and one full night over a terrain that would have strained a
yak.</p>

<p>She turned to fire. Her eyes shone green. Her forehead seemed to
flatten.</p>

<p>Before the boldest of the dokpas could carry out his plan of
stepping on Shattuck's face and seizing her at the same time she'd
literally brained him with a sliver of rock.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about this was that it gave an idea to the
more cunning wits of the crowd. The dokpas also groped for rocks. At
least two of them failed to do their groping fast enough.</p>

<p>Mahree threw a rock splinter with the free-shoulder grace and
power of a professional ball-player--although she'd never seen one.
She scored two perfect hits. Then a rock like the end of a
sledge-hammer caught her shoulder and she staggered.</p>

<p>She was staggering, trying not to fall, when she saw another sort
of lama coming through the gorge. He'd seen what was happening. His
hands were up. He was shouting things that Mahree couldn't
understand, but which the expression on his face told her were
prayers on her own behalf and denunciation of the dokpas.</p>

<p>THE black faces got his message. They turned on him with howls.
One of them with a stone all ready let fly at him and scraped his
head. The young lama covered his face with his hands and arms and
kept on coming.</p>

<p>It was his only way of fighting back.</p>

<p>One of the black-face ruffians already had his hands on him when
from behind and above the young lama a hand plunged down with a knife
in it. That was one good knife that was apt to be lost forever. The
dokpa went down with the blade out of sight in his shock of hair.</p>

<p>That was Juma's knife. It was Juma, looking more than his six-foot
seven, who had followed John Day here--Champela, whom he'd found in
the Lamasery of the Soaring Meditation. Champela himself was just
setting out, having heard that Torang, the abbot's horse, had but
then returned without the Shadak Khan.</p>

<p>HAMPELA and Juma had then run the length of the valley. But
Mahree, even so, had got there first--a long first, having followed
some instinct of her own.</p>

<p>Juma cried to heaven as he tried to pull his precious knife from
the dead man's skull. It wouldn't come. It was a tussel as short as
it was fierce--Juma's struggle with the stubborn knife.</p>

<p>He was losing seconds, and in any sort of fight Juma never lost
any time. He spat on the corpse and almost, without looking, had
found the throat of another black face with his able hands.</p>

<p>The others were in full flight. Champela came to Shattuck's side.
He lightly touched a temple; he thrust his fingers into Shattuck's
shirt.</p>

<p>It was clear that he thought at first that Shattuck was dead--the
end of a dream, the eclipse of a great adventure!</p>

<p>Mahree, with all that she had left of consciousness--after that
wallop with a rock---centered in her eyes, let out the beginning of a
wail.</p>

<p>"Ai-ya-yat I have killed him! He went away because of me! And I
meant nothing! I loved him only as a sister!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the prime minister of Shadak Khan. "He's not
dead!"</p>

<p>It was a message that went up to old Juma, too.</p>

<p>Juma, having just killed two men, one by stabbing and one by
barehanded strangling, was leaning over with a great deep tenderness
burning in the secret cavern back of his old-eagle eyes.</p>

<p>"Allah Akbar!" he said.</p>

<p>He gently pushed the prime minister aside. He stooped and picked
up Captain Trouble, as if that famous Fighting Fool was the merest
infant.</p>

<p>"Friend," he said, "if you know any effective magic, I'll see that
you get a couple of those runaway camels."</p>

<p>"Get him quickly to the tent of the governors," John Day said.
"You put them out and I'll do my best."</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p>SHATTUCK was getting well. As soon as they were able to move him
again they'd carried him up the valley to the Lamasery of the Soaring
Meditation where there were some authentic records of Kubla Khan.</p>

<p>They'd found--by a well authenticated miracle, it was
claimed--Kubla's sword where Shadak Khan had dropped it when he
fell--as he thought--dead. And the sword was presented to the new
khan by the old dogpo himself--the divine incarnation who had the
power, it was generally believed, to look into the past lives of
others.</p>

<p>Perhaps the good old man saw something in some past life of this
modern Captain Trouble, something that linked him with the life of
Kubla Khan.</p>

<p>It was, according to the secret books, about the time that an
avatar should come about to purge the world before the coming of the
Great New King.</p>

<p>The times were full of portent.</p>

<p>Tibet itself would have to be purged. There were mysteries in
Tibet such as the world never dreamed of, John Day said. There were
hollow mountains he knew about where the secret libraries of the ages
had been stored away.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you and I find them?" Shattuck asked.</p>

<p>"We'd find them, all right; but how about the guardians?"</p>

<p>"What sort of guardians?"</p>

<p>"If I thought we had a right to get into those caves we'd get into
them," said Captain Trouble.</p>

<p>"There you go! I thought you'd had enough of fighting for a
time!"</p>

<p>"I'll never have enough of it so long as there is anything worth
fighting for."</p>

<p>Unknown to Shattuck, there was a scribe in the monastery making a
record of his stay. Some day, it was argued, such a record might be
as valuable as such a one concerning Alexander the Great would
be.</p>

<p>"And, according to the horoscope that three of the astrologers in
three different lamaseries cast up, this man Shadak Khan, was going
to have a number of stirring adventures. . . ." He had one, in fact,
before it was considered advisable for him to leave his bed.</p>

<p>He awoke one night to see a huge dokpa crawling into his room on
all fours. It was this fact that discovered to Shattuck the identity
of the man, because, walking on all fours like that, he revealed a
limp in the shoulder where he'd been stopped by a bullet the day he
tried to saber Shattuck from behind.</p>

<p>"Ah, go on and get out of here, you big bum!" said the Fighting
Fool in English.</p>

<p>And that's what the big bum did--sneaked out and never showed
himself again.</p>

<p>Juma had sent for his people, for Juma also would be lingering on
in the valley indefinitely. He'd become as you might say the official
steward of the loot--camels, horses, boxes of machine-guns, small
arms, and ammunition.</p>

<p>Juma loved especially to sit in when Captain Trouble and his prime
minister talked about cleaning up some robber band or other and
starting an independent state where men could be free and women happy
and everyone would get enough to eat--with a few punitive expeditions
now and then, just to keep your hand in.</p>

<p>BUT, best of all, was when the two of them were alone on some
upper terrace of the lamasery and the earth so uptilted about them
that it almost seemed they were among the stars. Then it was no mere
correction of some poor robber band that engrossed them. They talked
greatly of great conquerors--men who had been sent into the world to
boost men on--by struggle, pain, self-mastery.</p>

<p>There was the inevitable struggle between Asia and Europe--the
never surveyed frontiers of China and Russia, for example; the
necessary merging of nations that still hated and feared each other;
there was the growing challenge of Africa--a riddle as ancient and
profound as that of the Great Sphinx.</p>

<p>And when it was all over, when they had the world cleaned up, why,
maybe then, they'd go back to America and settle down, like
Cincinnatus, on some quiet farm.</p>
