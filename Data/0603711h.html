<h1>The Red Road to Shamballah</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Perley Poore Sheehan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>I</h2>

<p>ALTHOUGH he was American--related on his father's side with Daniel
Boone and his mother's side with Nathan Hale---somewhere in the
makeup of Pelham Rutledge Shattuck there was a strong streak of the
Oriental as well. There must have been. For all the time he sat his
horse there in the on blackness of the great desert and looked at the
strange blue flame in front of him he could feel the two currents at
work in him.</p>

<p>The American part of him was telling him that the flame was
natural--it was magnetic, electrical, or just some new form of
luminous gas. But almost equally strong was his Oriental feeling that
this was ghostly.</p>

<p>The little war-horse he rode was taking that blue light for no
ordinary fact at any rate. The animal had reared back on its
haunches. Shattuck could feel it tremble between his knees.</p>

<p>At first, there had been just that blue flame. It flickered in
mid-air perhaps twenty paces in advance. Its evolution was swift. It
became a pillar of blue light resting on the earth. This expanded.
And now, in the center of the blue radiance, Shattuck saw the figure
of a man.</p>

<p>Shattuck stared.</p>

<p>From the time of that childhood of his, passed at treaty ports up
and down the Chinese coast, generally in the company of Chinese
servants, he had been in contact with various sorts of magic.</p>

<p>What was this then--a ro-long?</p>

<p>Many were the tales he'd heard of ro-longs---those unfortunate
dead brought back to life--boys, girls, men and women--to serve the
unholy will of some vicious master.</p>

<p>Were such things possible? Sure they were possible!</p>

<p>But, even while this speculation, with a crowd of others, was
racing through his mind, his eyes were telling him that this
apparition, whatever it was, would be unable to hurt him if he only
kept his nerve.</p>

<p>He quieted his horse. He took a mental survey of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>He was in the midst of the Kara Kugen--the Black Hills of the
Gobi. It was a region with such an evil reputation for ghostly
dangers that even the wildest of the fighting nomads gave it a wide
berth.</p>

<p>BACK of him was Kara Koto, that "Black City" he had come to find.
Ahead of him there had been a battle in progress between rival
factions of this lost city of the desert.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but--face it out!</p>

<p>He could see now that the apparition before him--luminous, ghostly
still--was that of a high--class lama. The head was shaven. The
expression of the face was pensive.</p>

<p>THE nobility of this head and face gave Shattuck his first inkling
as to the identity of this ghostly visitant. It was a surmise almost
instantly strengthened when he saw the stranger's robe emerge from
the blue light-haze that enveloped it and become what looked like a
tissue of woven gold.</p>

<p>"The Living Buddha!" Shattuck cried, with reverential awe, and he
swung down from the pony's back.</p>

<p>There were many "Bogdos," Living Buddhas, or Great Holy Ones,
scattered throughout Central Asia. There was the old Bogdo of the
Soaring Meditation, for example, whom Shattuck himself had met. It
was that old holy man who had recommended that Shattuck make this
pilgrimage to the great lost city of the Gobi--the Black City, Kara
Koto.</p>

<p>Now Shattuck was beginning to guess why. The old man had wanted
him to meet "the Shining One." The almost killing pilgrimage thus far
into the region of the black sands had been a sort of test, an
initiation.</p>

<p>"You are--He?" Shattuck gasped.</p>

<p>His excitement was such that he'd spoken in English. It was in
English he heard the reply.</p>

<p>"I am He."</p>

<p>All languages were said to be alike to the Great One.</p>

<p>"I was sent here," said Shattuck, "by the Bogdo of Samding--the
Lamasery of the Soaring Meditation."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Just now, here in the desert, I and my two companions met a
Chinese lady. She called herself Miao Chen, the Goddess of
Mercy."</p>

<p>"She was but an illusion, sent to test you."</p>

<p>"I killed a man. He called himself Kuan Yu, the War Lord."</p>

<p>"He also was but an illusion--to test your courage."</p>

<p>Awe is a peculiar thing--half fear, half exultation. Shattuck felt
a surge of awe sweeping over him.</p>

<p>"But these others I saw," said Shattuck--"the band of warriors who
followed Kuan Yu, and the Lang, those human wolves!"</p>

<p>"Illusions all. They've frightened others away from this place.
They've not frightened you--nor your two companions, Juma, the
Kirghiz robber, and Champela, the lama, whose father came from
America."</p>

<p>"Holy One," Shattuck avowed, "you know, then, everything."</p>

<p>"Even to that title given you, my son, of 'the Fighting
Fool.'"</p>

<p>ALL the time that the conversation had been carried on, thus far,
Shattuck had continued to fit it in with all that he'd ever known.
This was an apparition in front of him. He was certain of that. Yet
the Gobi itself was real enough. He could feel the sand under his
feet. So were his fatigue, hunger, thirst--and dirt!--real
enough.</p>

<p>He'd been for so long without a bath that he could have passed for
a "dokpa"--a fighting black lama, the sort who never washed.</p>

<p>The Living Buddah--or the apparition of the Living Buddah--who
stood-there almost within reach of his hand, looked at him for a
while without word or movement.</p>

<p>He seemed to furnish his own light. Shattuck himself was standing
in the fringe of this light--a blue radiance, soft but
penetrating.</p>

<p>To test the light, Shattuck put out his soiled hand and looked at
it. He straightened and doubled his fingers. He could see the
callouses. He saw the smudges ground in from many campfires.</p>

<p>Ever since entering the region of the black sands, water had been
at a premium. He and his two friends had suffered. The camels had
suffered.</p>

<p>Yet--Shattuck also remembered this as he stood there now--each
time the crisis seemed to mean death or defeat, a well had been
found, a bit of marsh, even a live spring, and these in regions
marked on all maps as having no water.</p>

<p>"Illusions!" said Shattuck.</p>

<p>"Illusions, my son!"</p>

<p>"I must have got into a state," said Shattuck, "where I can't tell
what's real and what isn't real."</p>

<p>"You've stood the test so far," said the Living Buddah.</p>

<p>Shattuck felt that he was being studied---examined outside and in.
Anyway, he was up against something that he'd been hearing about off
and on practically ever since he could remember.</p>

<p>"HAD a dream," said Shattuck, "that even a Fighting Fool might be
useful in the world just now. I told my dream to the old holy man of
the Soaring Meditation. It was by his wish I was given the sword of
Kubla Khan. With it I fought a battle and was almost killed. But I
seem to have won great wealth--a string of camels, three hundred
camel-loads of machine-guns and ammunition--"</p>

<p>"Wealth for yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, to fight with."</p>

<p>"To fight what for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I hope--for Shamballah."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Shamballah?"</p>

<p>"Only what I have heard--the empire of Maitreya, the coming King
of the World."</p>

<p>The Shining Lama had continued to look at Shattuck quietly.</p>

<p>"Trouble," said the Shining One, "already casts a shadow over the
face of the world. It is a sign of the end of the old world, the
approach of the new. They call you Captain Trouble--Shadak Khan! And
the road to Shamballah will be long and red, Shadak Khan. Are you
sure you are ready to take it--with your sword of Kubla Khan?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"We'll meet again, Captain Trouble."</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>A SECOND later--and for a period after that---Pel Shattuck, alias
Shadak Khan, wondered if he wasn't again a victim of illusion.
Asia--all Asia--was the original Land of Illusion. There were
shamans, fakirs, lamas of the old Red Sect, everywhere, who were not
only master hypnotists but who dealt with even stranger powers.</p>

<p>Shattuck wondered what had happened.</p>

<p>A second ago he had been talking to that ghostly apparition of the
Living Buddah--the greatest of all Living Buddahs. There came to
Shattuck the impact of an idea that this might have been the original
Buddah Himself--the great Gautauma.</p>

<p>Now, even more suddenly than the apparition had shown itself, it
was gone again.</p>

<p>Shattuck put out his hand. He couldn't see it. The darkness of the
desert night was blacker than ever. The sudden inrush of this
blackness brought a sort of suffocation with it. It was like a
blackness of utter despair.</p>

<p>But Shattuck pulled himself together. He still had the sword in
his hand. He'd continued to hold it against his breast, in an
attitude of respect.</p>

<p>He turned and groped for the little war-horse. The pony was gone.
He remembered now. The pony was supposed to have been the one ridden
by Kuan Yu, the great warlord. Kuan Yu had been an illusion. So,
then, had the horse itself been an illusion.</p>

<p>Shattuck thought of that vision of a girl--Miao Shen, painted,
covered with silks and jewels, calling herself the Goddess of
Mercy.</p>

<p>And the words of the Living Buddah, the Shining One, came back to
him:</p>

<p>"She was but an illusion, sent to test you!"</p>

<p>Shattuck would have laughed, but his caked lips hurt. Still, his
heart was throbbing with a sort of exhilaration. He'd stood some
tests, even if they were illusions. He'd fought a war-lord. He'd
resisted the blandishments of a Chinese goddess---and one, at that,
with the highest reputation for beauty and sweetness.</p>

<p>He thought of his friends.</p>

<p>What had happened to them? He'd left them and the camels inside
the ruined wall of the ancient, ruined city of Kara Koto--home of
magic, home of a thousand legends, gateway--it was said--to the
mysteries of Shamballah!</p>

<p>HAD they also been the victims of strange devils and gods during
his absence?</p>

<p>As he stood there in the blackness he could hear nothing, see
nothing except the stars overhead. Weren't the stars themselves
nothing but illusions?</p>

<p>He pulled himself together. He raised his head and let out a call
that he and his friends used:</p>

<p>"Ki-ho-ho!"</p>

<p>It couldn't have been very loud, but the cry slithered off into
the vastness of the Gobi like a meteor of sound, the silence was
such.</p>

<p>IT seemed as if a full minute must have passed before a reply came
back. It came faintly, like an echo, and from a quarter opposite to
the one from which he had been expecting it.</p>

<p>He tried it again.</p>

<p>This time there were two replies. From opposite directions! That
was easy--Shattuck told himself. Juma and Champela had gone out to
look for him. They'd taken opposite directions.</p>

<p>But the absurdity of this explanation occurred to him instantly.
They wouldn't have gone out looking for him in the dark and made no
sound. They wouldn't have left the camels unguarded. They wouldn't,
that is, unless they also had been led away as he had been led
away.</p>

<p>As he stood there in the almost solid black of a trough between
two rolling dunes, a breath of air came in from the further
blackness. It brought with it a scent that was unmistakable and
unforgettable---musky, aromatic, a smell of temple incense that had
somewhere, somehow, burrowed its way into the very depths of
Shattuck's soul.</p>

<p>Illusion or no illusion, he started to trace it.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in that. The faint breeze held steady, it
strengthened.</p>

<p>Shattuck had traveled perhaps a hundred yards along the winding
trough of the dunes when he was aware that it was no longer so dark
as it had been. Dawn, he guessed, could not be far off. Even now the
sun, most likely, would be striking the high crests of the Tien
Shan--the Heavenly Mountains of the Chinese--and reflecting its light
out across the vast stretches of the Gobi.</p>

<p>He'd barely made this notation in his mind when he saw, dimly, a
drift of shadows ahead of him, he heard a faint grind and shift of
camel feet and gear. There could be no doubt about it.</p>

<p>A caravan was coming this way--a caravan strangely silent--a
caravan traveling without bells, without other unnecessary sound of
any kind.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>SHATTUCK stooped and ran. It took but a few steps to take him
around the curve of a dune. He stood there for a while in
thought--measuring each second that passed, crowding into each second
all that he could of planning, deduction, foresight.</p>

<p>Presently he crawled up the slope of sand to the top of the dune.
It was still so dark that there was small chance of his being
discovered, but he was as careful as any Apache on the scout.</p>

<p>He could see the caravan again--the camels moving nimbly as if
urged to make speed. Each camel was heavily loaded. The mere contour
of their shadowy forms and their movement was sufficient to advertise
that.</p>

<p>In this part of the desert such a caravan could be headed for but
a single place--that black and ruined city of Kara Koto.</p>

<p>Shattuck surveyed the dark horizon. He made out a black mass of
different conformation than that of the undulating dunes. That would
be Kara Koto with its crumbling walls.</p>

<p>Once Kara Koto had been one of the great cities of the world. The
sands had buried it. It had lain buried for so many centuries that
the mere existence of it had become a legend. Now, after all these
centuries, the winds had shifted it out of its grave again.</p>

<p>WHY should this strange caravan be making for the dead city now?
There was only one answer. Kara Koto was not so dead as it seemed.
Why should the caravan be moving with such haste?</p>

<p>Manifestly to reach cover before daylight.</p>

<p>There came to Shattuck all that he had ever heard of or dreamed
about in connection with Shamballah. Kara Koto, according to the
gossip of half the world, was, in some way, the gateway to
Shamballah.</p>

<p>More clearly and insistently yet, there came to Shattuck that
strange conversation he'd had a little while ago with the
spirit-presence of the Living Buddha. But this was no fresh illusion.
Illusions were past.</p>

<p>He could foresee for himself and his friends all sorts of
complications if he delayed where he was too long. Even now there was
barely time for him to reach the ruined city before the caravan got
there. If he failed in this, harm might come to old Juma and the
mystic Champela.</p>

<p>Again he was running. He had chosen a direction that would bring
him to the crest of a dune under which the caravan would have to
pass.</p>

<p>It was almost day--torang, as they called it back in the hills--a
white tail of light flaunting across the sky. It reminded him of a
white-tailed horse he'd ridden, and the thought somehow gave him an
extra dash of courage. It was like a good omen.</p>

<p>He straightened up with the sword of Kubla Khan held aloft.
Suddenly the dark was shot full of golden mist as the sun came
up.</p>

<p>"Halt, down there!" he shouted. He managed to laugh.</p>

<p>At his first glance he saw that the camels were the finest he had
ever seen. How many there were of them he couldn't even guess. Here
among the dunes the trail wound round out of sight.</p>

<p>Both the camels and the men in charge of them, and then the dogs
that swarmed along, were different from those of the Southern Gobi
and the great caravan trails between China and Turkestan.</p>

<p>The camels were almost white and heavily wooled. The dogs were
white. The men in charge and those who walked were dressed in
white.</p>

<p>There was a strong prejudice against white animals and white
clothing all through the Gobi. White was the color of Chinese
mourning. Shattuck could imagine what sort of an impression a caravan
like this might make on a superstitious native when glimpsed at
night.</p>

<p>The caravan had halted. There were looks of fear, but more of wild
amazement on the faces that Shattuck saw which were turned his
way.</p>

<p>The faces were lean and brown. They were neither Chinese nor
Mongolian. For the most part they were as aquiline as old Juma's
face. Many of them were bearded.</p>

<p>SUDDENLY a name had flashed into Shattuck's thought.</p>

<p>These were the Agharti--the "subterranean people," as they were
sometimes called; or the people of the Chud, meaning the "Wonder
People," the "Miracle People"--one of the Lost Tribes, the people of
Solomon, who'd kept alive through centuries the magic of Solomon, so
some of the legends ran.</p>

<p>While their amazement still held them, Shattuck spoke again:</p>

<p>"Make ready a camel. I am to ride at your head."</p>

<p>There was some sort of a confab going on among those near the head
camel. It was a splendid beast. There was hardly any load on it at
all. Such as there was might have been mere personal equipment of
sorts.</p>

<p>SOMEONE stepped a few paces from the others and called back:</p>

<p>"Duke, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Lo, he who speaks to you," he called back, "is Shadak Khan, the
new War Lord of the World. It is he who shall clear the long red road
to Shamballah for the coming of the King Maitreya. He has but now
spoken to the Wearer of the Shining Robe!" If it had started out to
be a bluff it hadn't ended as one.</p>

<p>Before Shattuck had spoken half a dozen words, it was as if the
words had taken possession of himself. It was as if his "genius" were
speaking for him. It was always the "genius" that possessed him when
he had a fight on hand, when he was in a corner.</p>

<p>He was in a corner now--in a jam.</p>

<p>There was a swift whistle and a soft thud in the sand near his
feet. He looked down and saw an arrow vibrating there, half-buried in
the sand. A glance told him the direction it had come from. It meant
that there could be no retreat.</p>

<p>He came closer to the halted caravan. Like that, at least, he had
the brow of the sandhill back of him. He wouldn't be potted from
behind. But, even so, he could hear the movement of runners back of
him.</p>

<p>Not only that, he could see a gathering tenseness of the caravan
men below. With every step he took he could see fresh details. There
were other weapons in evidence than spears and bows and arrows. Here
and there a modern rifle gleamed. Rifles, as if carelessly, were
pointed in his direction. These men were neither ignorant Mongolians
nor superstitious Chinese. They were men to call a bluff.</p>

<p>"You hurry to your holes at sunup like white rabbits," he said.
"You need a leader."</p>

<p>It was a reference to the riderless camel that led the
caravan.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken in reply.</p>

<p>Shattuck slowly turned and looked at those who had run up back of
him. They were all young men, tall and slender, black-eyed,
black-haired, but of a color almost fair.</p>

<p>There was no hint of the Mongol about them, nothing Chinese. Most
of them carried bows and arrows of an antique fashion. He met their
concentrated glance and looked them over.</p>

<p>He knew his danger, but his thought was that with men like these a
man with the will, the imagination, and--the "genius!"--might set
about the conquest of the world.</p>

<p>He smiled at them slightly, but his teeth were set and his eyes
were narrowed.</p>

<p>Once more he turned and started down the hill.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>"WE have come into a land of spells and enchantment," said old
Juma, softly. "But you also know powerful spells, Lamachi."</p>

<p>It was a way he had of addressing Champela. It was like calling
him little old lama--Lamachi.</p>

<p>"I know powerful spells, Juma-la," Champela answered gently.</p>

<p>It was as if he'd called the old Kirghiz, "Mr. Juma," which was
also a form of affectionate address. The two men, so different in
other ways as well as that of their respective ages, had a profound
admiration for each other. It was a comradeship based on dangers
shared, on something even of mystery.</p>

<p>If Champela, a mystic follower of "the Path," admired and loved
this old warrior and robber, somewhat as a force in nature, like a
tiger, like a turbulent mountain-stream, Juma, the bearded warrior,
admired the young lama somewhat as he admired some distant,
incomprehensible star.</p>

<p>They sat on the sand inside the ruined wall of Kara Koto. They'd
come at last to the lost city of the Gobi. What next?</p>

<p>They'd been sitting here all the latter part of the night. How
they'd come here neither was quite certain.</p>

<p>Juma held to the belief that they'd been led here by jinns. The
jinns had appeared as an army of people with a beautiful Chinese
maiden in their midst.</p>

<p>Even Shadak Khan--just "Dak" to Juma--had been bemused. He'd left
them in charge of the camels and the maiden while he went back into
the desert to settle some fight that seemed to be going on out there.
He had not returned. It was almost dawn.</p>

<p>"Ai-ya-ya!" moaned Juma. "If Dak be lost--"</p>

<p>He beat his breast three hard knocks with his bony fist.</p>

<p>CHAMPELA sat very still. His shaven head of a lama was bare. He
was as if unconscious of the penetrating desert cold. He'd let his
heavy lama robe of red wool and even his silk undergarment slip from
his shoulder. Both shoulder and right arm were bare. In the faint
dawn-light his finely modeled face shone composed and white. On it
was a look of satisfaction almost like that of someone who has had a
happy death.</p>

<p>"Lamachi," Juma whispered, "what do you see?"</p>

<p>"A long white caravan," the mystic answered.</p>

<p>"A long white caravan," moaned Juma, "is a sign of death."</p>

<p>"There has been a death."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The leader of the caravan."</p>

<p>"Dak?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>JUMA snarled a laugh. "There'll be deaths enough--one for each of
his fingers and toes---by Satan I swear it!--if they've murdered
Dak---though I have to follow them to hell--"</p>

<p>The lama, half-American as he was, faintly smiled as he put out a
hand to quiet the old man. The hand stayed where it was on Juma's
knee, the fingers tightened.</p>

<p>"Juma," Champela whispered, "the caravan is near. And so is Shadak
Khan. I can hear his thought. He is calling us. He is telling to get
the camels ready. We are to join him ..."</p>

<p>It was a prophecy, but, like most prophecies, it contained an
element of the tragically unexpected.</p>

<p>Barely had they roused the camels and flung the light packs to
their thinning backs when there was a rush and a howl like that of a
rising wind. It was just at the point of day, and through that thin
cold light Juma and Champela saw a mob of apelike creatures swing
into sight.</p>

<p>They were men, all right, but nearly naked, covered with hair.
There was an animal quality also in the way they herded. There was
little sign of individual movement among them. They ran in a compact
mass.</p>

<p>"The Chud!" cried Juma.</p>

<p>His eyes had brightened. He was shaking a little, but it was the
tremor of a hound in the presence of game. From the pack of the
nearest camel he'd slipped out a rifle.</p>

<p>"Hold!" said Champela.</p>

<p>It wasn't his opposition to killing that made him try to restrain
the old warrior. It was a keener recognition of the danger involved.
He also had heard of this tribe of the two so-called "subterranean
peoples" living in the secret expanses of the Gobi--survivals of the
inhabitants of the Gobi's buried cities.</p>

<p>There were two such peoples--the Chud and the Agharti. Under
almost the same conditions the two peoples had drawn apart, although
the old records had given them a common origin. The Chuds had gone
down in the scale of evolution---down and back. While the Agharti had
risen.</p>

<p>Even the camels seemed effected by the sudden apparition of the
Chud. The animals had begun to moan, they tossed their heads and
gnashed their teeth.</p>

<p>AT first it had seemed as if this swarm of subhuman people were
making for the open desert through a breach in the wall. Then
something, it may have been the scent of the camels, brought them
round. In an instant they'd all turned at once, were looking through
the dim light to where the two companions and their four camels stood
in the shadow of the city's ruined wall.</p>

<p>The Chud horde let out a sort of moaning howl that took on
volume.</p>

<p>They charged.</p>

<p>The Chud were armed. The arms they carried had come down from some
long past age, but they were none the less effective for
that--spears, maces, swords, knives of queer design. But, even in
that breathless excitement of their charge, it could be seen that
they were unused to the weapons.</p>

<p>Some brandished their weapons clumsily. Some even flung them away
as if this were a race instead of a battle-charge.</p>

<p>Juma fired five shots into the thick of the swarm as fast as he
could pump the modern rifle he held. With an oath--when he discovered
that the magazine was empty--he clubbed the weapon and ran a few
steps forward to meet the rush.</p>

<p>BUT Champela was even faster. Champela had rushed ahead of the old
Kirghiz warrior with his bare arm raised. He shouted some plea or
command. He went down under a dozen blows.</p>

<p>He would have been trampled to death--or torn to death--by that
infernal pack, if it hadn't been for Juma. Juma was like a giant
among the gnomish Chud. He reared twice their height. He swung his
clubbed rifle and there was a swath like that cut by a scythe. Only,
the bloody harvest wouldn't stay down.</p>

<p>It writhed. It screeched. It rose again.</p>

<p>Even now, Juma, old warrior that he was, could tell that he and
Champela were not the chief object of the attack. It was, perhaps,
all that had saved them in this first rush.</p>

<p>The camels were what the Chud were after.</p>

<p>Juma, having fought his way free enough to lift Champela from the
red welter at his feet, himself turned toward the camels.</p>

<p>The animals were in agony already---sprawling, roaring,
choking--as the Chud swarmed over them, devouring them alive.</p>

<p>Champela revived as from a dash of cold horror. He flung himself
at the uncanny butchers with bare hands. Juma was at his side. From
some fallen enemy Juma had snatched an iron mace.</p>

<p>But the two of them were dragged down---strangled, blinded.</p>

<p>The last that either of them knew, just then, was the sound of a
familiar voice.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>AS Shattuck came down toward that white caravan standing in the
early morning light of the desert he suffered from a single fear. Was
this, after all, some other illusion that had been thrown up before
his eyes?</p>

<p>There was enough about the appearance of everything he saw to make
him believe that such might be the case.</p>

<p>The darkness had now turned to a sparkle of gold--a gold that was
tinged with pink. In this glamorous light the camels were like
creatures dreamed of by Sinbad. They were huge beasts. Their heavy
coats were like a golden fleece. They had fine small heads and
luminous eyes. Their trappings were of the finest--in polychromed
leather, set with rough gems and some dark wood that was richly
carved and polished.</p>

<p>No less extraordinary was the appearance of the men. Some of these
had been riding as he started down the slope. These had slipped down
from their mounts and now stood waiting.</p>

<p>Even the footmen, the camel-pullers, generally the lowest slaves
of the desert, had a distinguished look about them, like high-class
Arabs, but lighter. The general complexion was that of pale gold.</p>

<p>They were all dressed alike in cloaks of a general Mongolian cut,
but white--evidently handwoven from wool of their camels; and on
their heads tall conical caps, also of wool, with earlaps, but no
decorations, no jewels.</p>

<p>IN comparison with the meanest of these men, Shattuck knew that he
himself must look like a tramp.</p>

<p>But something was beating inside of him, holding possession of
him--his genius, some higher self, call it what you will.</p>

<p>"Who speaks the language of Shadak Khan?" he asked, in the
Northern dialect of China. It was the dialect he'd learned best as a
child.</p>

<p>A group had formed about the lead camel. There was silence.</p>

<p>Thrust through the girth or pack-rope of this camel there was the
usual spear with a flag attached such as the leaders of all caravans
carry--one of the most ancient rites of the Gobi. The flag shook out
in the breeze.</p>

<p>ON it Shattuck saw the symbol that he recognized. It was as if
he'd swallowed a draught of some magic elixir.</p>

<p>"Who speaks the language of Shadak Khan?" he demanded again</p>

<p>One of the elders of the group near the lead camel answered
him:</p>

<p>"Sir, I do--if you be he--"</p>

<p>"If I be he! Do you know your banner?"--he pointed at the
flag.</p>

<p>"That banner has been carried by our people," the old man said,
"for more than half a thousand years. It's the banner of the great
Chi Tsu!"</p>

<p>"Who rides the camel?"</p>

<p>"Chi Tsu--when he comes again!"</p>

<p>"He has come again," said. Shattuck--or the genius that was
speaking for him. "You shall know him by his sword!"</p>

<p>And he thrust the carved hilt of the sword he carried toward the
group. But he wouldn't advance. Neither would he let them touch it.
The group strained forward.</p>

<p>"Lo! Lo!"</p>

<p>It was almost a sob.</p>

<p>"The sign! The sign!"</p>

<p>From around the curve of the dunes other white-robed camel men
came running. There was a rising shout.</p>

<p>"It's the sign of Chi Tsu!"</p>

<p>Now the cries and most of the speech were in some ancient dialect
of Mandarin Chinese--the Kuan-hua--that Shattuck could understand.
And also he could understand that reference of theirs to the sign of
Chi Tsu.</p>

<p>For the sign on the flag and that on the hilt of his sword were
the same and Chi Tsu was the old Chinese name of Kubla Khan.</p>

<p>"I am here!" Shattuck cried.</p>

<p>There was something about him--that genius of his that was shining
out--shining through his rags and his dirt--that told all those who
saw him and heard him that he--or his genius at least--was speaking
the truth.</p>

<p>Some of those nearest him were already falling to their knees and
bumping their heads against the sands.</p>

<p>"I am here!" Shattuck repeated. "No more as Kubla Khan. But as
Shadak Khan! Come to clear the long red road--"</p>

<p>Through the tumult of sound about him he caught that swift
staccato bark of Juma's rifle.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>IT was as if he'd been plucked by a spur. He went as tense as a
bucking horse before its first leap, and in a moment he had leaped.
He'd made a spring for the lead camel of the caravan.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he shouted. "And victory to the Gods!"</p>

<p>"Lha-gyal-lo!"</p>

<p>That wasn't Chinese. It was a phrase he had picked up somewhere in
the hills. But he knew what it meant. So, evidently, did a good many
of those in this great white caravan.</p>

<p>They were repeating it like a battle-cry:</p>

<p>"Lha-gyal-lo!"</p>

<p>It was a cry that was to be repeated up and down the length and
breadth of Asia as the battle--cry of Shadak Khan.</p>

<p>Lo, Kubla Khan--Gesher Khan--Shak Khan--Captain Trouble!--he was
back again in the Gobi, and his battle-cry was this:</p>

<p>"Lha-gyal-lo!"</p>

<p>IT was only later that Shattuck learned that the lead camel of the
caravan was one that had never before been ridden. It was a lordly
beast, young and powerful and proud. Its name was Shen Lung--as one
might say, "Dragon of the Winds."</p>

<p>Like the winds it ran now, all right--at the feel of that living
weight on its back. It ran with the speed of the wild camels of the
Gobi. Under that deceptive caparison of white wool there was a body
as lean and tough as that of a bull moose.</p>

<p>Shen Lung was making a hurricane of his own as he shot his great
weight forward.</p>

<p>There was a wind in Shattuck's face that almost stopped his
breath. But, somehow, he had found the saddle. Still, he knew that it
was by the grace of God--no less!--that the camel was on a familiar
track. It was a track that led him over a high breach--banked up with
sand--in the ruined walls of Kara Koto.</p>

<p>Almost from the first giddy slip into speed, Shen Lung had left
the rest of the caravan far behind him.</p>

<p>Shattuck heard a diminishing shout in the wind. That shout was
barely gone when he was hearing another. It was a different and
complex roar that reached him from the ruined city.</p>

<p>The camel ran up a slope and had pitched down the other side.
Shattuck was thrown, but as luck--or Destiny--would have it, he'd
landed on his feet. He'd clung to his sword--as every nerve of him
would have clung to an arm or a leg.</p>

<p>And there before him he saw such a spectacle of slaughter that a
shock of sickness hit him. It came with a stench of blood. He saw
dead men lying about--wounded men crawling about like scotched
baboons. But the thing that had really slugged him was the spectacle
of a red feast in progress over his slaughtered camels.</p>

<p>It was the fear that smote him.</p>

<p>ONE glance had been enough for him to recognize these people. He'd
heard a thousand weird and grisly tales of the Chud. These were the
Chud. In their ravenous appetite for meat the Chud were cannibals. So
many of the campfire tales of the Gobi had it--tales of travelers
lured into lonely places and there torn to bits--eaten alive.</p>

<p>But who had ever seen the Chud and lived to tell of them
afterward?</p>

<p>Once in a Chinese village Shattuck had seen what he'd taken to be
a hairy idiot displayed like a bear in a cage. A Mongol with a
horribly scarred face was exhibiting the wonder.</p>

<p>"The only Chud in captivity!"</p>

<p>Curious the memories that spin through the brain of a man in
crowded moments.</p>

<p>The words of the Mongol barker came back. The Chuds ate human
flesh. The Chuds lived in caves. The Chuds were a cross of bears and
bats.</p>

<p>Shattuck caught the Chud nearest him by the hair and snatched him
backward. He saw a grimace of insane rage and terror. Shattuck's
sword was at the creature's throat. But the man was old.</p>

<p>"Where are the white gods, my friends?" Shattuck panted. There was
no answer. Some delayed band of the Chud came racing from among the
ruins--fifty or a hundred. They made straight for Shattuck with a
sort of gibbering shriek. The shriek sounded like wild laughter.</p>

<p>They were on him almost before he had time to fling the old man
aside and he was caught in a turmoil of stench and demoniac riot that
momentarily maddened him. From this be fought himself clear with the
mad energy of a man caught in a whirlpool. Covered with blood he
staggered clear.</p>

<p>All this an affair of seconds.</p>

<p>But seconds ago Shen Lung had swept over the wall with him into
this stinking hell.</p>

<p>Where was Champela? Where was Juma? Had they been the first
victims of this orgy?</p>

<p>He could see what had passed with the camels. He could tell by the
way they had fallen--the way they looked even under this living cloak
of human vermin squirming over them now. The beasts had been
literally torn to pieces on their feet.</p>

<p>The sight and the smell--and also the fact, perhaps, that again he
was free of an unaccustomed rider on his back--had brought Shen Lung,
the great white camel, to a stand. Shen Lung stood there, sprawling,
swaying slightly, a little stricken with the panic of what he
perceived and this sudden separation from his mates.</p>

<p>All this was happening with a speed like that of an
avalanche--deceptive, seemingly slow, but shrieking toward new
catastrophe like a high--powered shell.</p>

<p>AT sight of the great white camel a mob of the Chud who'd been
crowded from the earlier feast sprang at him with a howl of glee. One
was quicker than the others--covered with blood, armed with an
antique scimitar.</p>

<p>Shattuck met him on the run and cut him just above the eyes. He
sliced at others. He was horrified, raging. But he would no longer
kill unless he had to. These weren't men. They were animals. They
were the degenerate children of men. He bawled that battle-cry of
his-"Victory to the Gods!"--like a prayer, like a mantram, a word of
power.</p>

<p>"Lha-gyal-lo!"</p>

<p>It must have been a mantram like that.</p>

<p>His heart leaped as he saw two red shapes lying close together.
Some way or other he cleaved a clear space about them.</p>

<p>"Champela!" he cried. "Juma!" He was kneeling in the blood and
slime at the side of his friends--he made a curious picture with
something symbolic in it, half-Mercy, half-Murder, like the great Pan
Ku, the Maker of the World Himself---when reinforcements got
there.</p>

<p>There were other fast camels in the Agharti caravan, and the men
to ride them, too, when the new incarnation of Kubla Khan was
there.</p>

<p>THEY came over the ruined wall of Kara Koto in a white
stampede--the camels, as was their wont, crazy to follow where their
leader, Shen Lung, had already showed them the way.</p>

<p>The Agharti fighting men fell to work.</p>

<p>The Chud were beginning to scatter like sated rats. They were
heavy with blood and filth. Most of them had abandoned their
weapons.</p>

<p>"Don't kill!"</p>

<p>It was curious that the first order Shadak Khan ever gave to these
new followers of his should be precisely that.</p>

<p>"Herd them!" Shattuck shouted. "Get them together! Pen them
up!"</p>

<p>He turned again to his battered companions.</p>

<p>Shadak Khan or no Shadak Khan, he would have given all he'd
dreamed of or ever hoped for to know that they'd still live.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>IN every victory some shadow to maintain the old balance of light
and shadow, high and low, of yin and yang!</p>

<p>Shattuck meditated on yin and yang in the hours that followed.
Now, "yin," according to Chinese philosophy, is the dark female
principle, that fumes up from the depth of the earth; "yang" the
bright male principle of the sunlight.</p>

<p>Yet now the Agharti, who were a fine, brave people, were
apparently headed for the center of the earth.</p>

<p>They'd made two litters, at their new Khan's direction, and on
these they'd placed with infinite care his two followers, the
warrior-chief and the lama-chief, Juma and Champela.</p>

<p>The Agharti's handling of the Chud had been exceeding swift. At
that order of Shadak Khan's to spare the creatures it had become an
affair of staves and camel-whips. Only the badly wounded of the Chud
were dispatched, and these swiftly.</p>

<p>The remainder of the horde--all those who hadn't got away to the
desert--were corralled like goats. Like goats they would be driven
later into some rock-fortress of the Agharti far down under the ruins
of Kara Koto.</p>

<p>Even in those first few minutes, while Shattuck was more occupied
with the care of his friends than the wonders of these two lost
tribes he'd somehow brought under his dominion, he was learning much
about the Chud and the Agharti. Both were, in fact, descendants of
some early race. Both had become what the outside world had come to
know as a "subterranean" people.</p>

<p>But only the Chud were truly subterranean. They subsisted on bats.
They herded them. They followed the bat swarms in their mysterious
migrations from cave to cave. The Chud did this as other nomads
followed their flocks across the scant grasslands of desert and
mountain.</p>

<p>THE Agharti, on the other hand, while keeping alive the secret
cult of the ancient race, had maintained a connection with the
outside world. There were emissaries of their race scattered
everywhere throughout the world--watching, waiting for the return of
the King of the world. They sent an annual caravan to some place they
called by the Russian name of "Belavoyde"--a name that meant "White
Waters"--where they met some wandering division of their people who
lived in the outside world. ...</p>

<p>"These two we must save," said Shattuck---Shadak Khan. "With
them--and the sword of Kubla Khan--the road to Shamballah lies
open."</p>

<p>"They may live," said an elder of the Agharti, "if we can get them
to the Temple."</p>

<p>The elder had the name of Li Ko-liang. It sounded like an
incantation to Shattuck. In Li Ko-liang's pale-gold face he saw some
quality of a benediction. He felt a breath of cleansing hope.</p>

<p>"Where is the Temple, Li Ko-liang?"</p>

<p>"The Temple, Khan, is in the Home of the Dragon, far down in the
great cave."</p>

<p>"Far down in the earth, Father Li, will there not be too much
yin?"</p>

<p>"Khan, where there is yin there is also yang."</p>

<p>"Let us make haste, then, but softly, to the Temple, Li
ko-liang."</p>

<p>They would have made a litter for Shattuck himself, if he'd have
permitted it, and carried him, since he wouldn't ride. He wouldn't
ride because he wanted to walk beside those two litters in which his
friends were carried.</p>

<p>And, once more the great white camel, Shen Lung, hereafter the
camel of Shadak Khan, took up the march.</p>

<p>They passed through the drifted ruins of Kara Koto to where a
great rift opened under a tilted ledge of rock. The rift was the
mouth of a cavernous descent that zigzagged downward into
darkness.</p>

<p>Here, either from the camel-packs or from some secret
hiding-place, a score or more of flambeaus were produced, and
Shattuck caught the familiar odor of burning crude oil, although the
smell had been disguised somewhat--and the flame also quickened, it
seemed--by some other oil, the oil of sesame, perhaps.</p>

<p>The camels knew the place. They did not seem to mind the bobbing
flames. For that matter, so far as Shattuck could judge, over half of
the caravan must have been moving, easily, swiftly, in the dark.</p>

<p>The way down followed a descending ledge, smooth but often at a
dizzy pitch. On one side there was a drop into darkness, on the other
a wall of rock.</p>

<p>AND sometimes, after a shifting turn, the wall and the abyss had
changed sides. The ceiling of this causeway to the "Home of the
Dragon," as Li Ko-liang referred to it, had disappeared long ago not
to appear again.</p>

<p>No one spoke. The white camels padded softly. The white dogs, that
had never barked since Shattuck had first seen them, trotted as if
along a familiar lane.</p>

<p>One by one Shattuck saw the flambeaux disappear, and still there
seemed to be no loss of light.</p>

<p>Then he saw, as they rounded another turn, what looked like a vast
tapestry of woven fire against an expanse of wall. It looked like a
tapestry in the course of being woven--the play of a thousand
shuttles of clear flame playing back and forth, up and down. A
lacelike pattern would be formed. It might hold for the time of a
dozen breaths, then start to shift and play again.</p>

<p>He'd heard rumors about these "fire-halls" and "fire-writings" of
the old sacred caves in various parts of Asia, but this was the first
he had ever seen of them. His engineering mind was telling him that
here was a seepage of oil or gas, probably mixed with water or
something more volatile still.</p>

<p>"We are near the Temple, Khan," said Li Koliang, softly.</p>

<p>"Has the Temple a holy man, Father Li?" Shattuck asked.</p>

<p>"Yea, Khan," the elder whispered; "the holiest of all, even he of
whom you spoke--He of the Shining Garment."</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>SHATTUCK had the sensation of having entered the greatest temple
in the world. It was--the Temple!</p>

<p>They'd come into a cavern that seemed immeasurable, yet it was but
one of a series of chambers through which they had passed. There'd
been other fire-tapestries. Here and there a twisting column of flame
as if flowered against the roof.</p>

<p>In the Temple there was a lake of fire. It was, Shattuck judged,
about a hundred yards in length and a half of that in breadth. But
neither was this a mass or a solid sheet of flames. The water of the
lake was visible. Across this, back and forth, now rising into thin
spirals and again sinking out of sight, twining and gliding like ten
thousand luminous skaters, the fire played in a myriad of blue
flames.</p>

<p>The lake lay against a wall that rose straight up and lost itself
in the shadows overhead. This wall had been carved into a series of
deep recesses or niches, and in each of these a god smiled down at
the eternal fire.</p>

<p>The gods were colossal. But they were small attendants to the
great central figure, that of Maitreya, the future King of the
World.</p>

<p>Shattuck heard a whisper, at his side:</p>

<p>"Him, O Shadak Khan, for whom you have come to prepare the
way!"</p>

<p>He thought that it was Li Ko-liang who had whispered to him. But
as he swiftly turned he discovered that for the moment he was
standing alone. Then the memory in his brain told him that he'd heard
the whisper in English.</p>

<p>He spoke aloud in English, careless of what those who heard him
might think of it.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said. "I have come to prepare the way."</p>

<p>The great image of Maitreya also was smiling as the light flared
up. Shattuck took it as a sort of promise as he turned to his
friends. The promise was fulfilled.</p>

<p>WITHIN a week, both Juma and Champela were up and about again.</p>

<p>Sometimes by the sacred lake of fire and sometimes up in the sun,
where the chastened Chud were now working to clean up the ruins of
Kara Koto, Shadak Khan sat with his two friends during their
convalescence and talked about the coming regeneration of the
world.</p>

<p>Throughout the world there was trouble. Captain Trouble would
clear it away. After Captain Trouble had done his work--or maybe
before that time--the King of the World would appear, and the world
would know peace and plenty again.</p>

<p>But there were things closer and just as vital to talk about.</p>

<p>First, there was the rebuilding of Kara Koto.</p>

<p>"We've found a capital," said Shadak Khan. "And we've found a
people. Also we've found a thing worth fighting for."</p>

<p>The three of them sat together one day by the sacred lake of fire
while a cold Gobi storm made the great Temple more than ever a
desirable place to live in, when they were aware that a fourth had
joined them.</p>

<p>"You've made a good start, Captain Trouble," said a quiet voice in
English.</p>

<p>They looked up quickly.</p>

<p>They saw, dimly, the shape of the Living Buddha standing
there.</p>

<p>"Great friend," said Shattuck softly, clutched by a sudden fear,
"is all this also illusion?"</p>

<p>The Presence smiled. Just then he looked like the vast stone image
of Maitreya. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You've stood the test of illusion, Shadak Khan," he said. "And
your work has just begun."</p>
