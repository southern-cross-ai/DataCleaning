<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">1. A WOMAN DIES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A KEEN October wind was cutting across the Drive
from the Hudson when Stephen Klaw came out of the side street. He
stopped in the lee of the corner apartment building, and lit a
cigarette. He did not at once put out the match, but held it cupped
in front of his face so that his clean-cut though rugged features
were illuminated.</p>

<p>Almost at once, a woman came darting from the shadows of the
park across the street. She was dressed in a black rain coat, and
wore no hat. Her dark hair streamed out behind her as she ran, in
zig-zag fashion, as if wounded. And the great spreading stain of
crimson upon the black background of the raincoat, just underneath
the heart, testified to the wound.</p>

<p>Under her right arm she was clutching a small black leather
brief case, which seemed to be more precious to her than the life
blood which was pouring from her body.</p>

<p>Before she had taken half a dozen steps across the wide expanse
of Riverside Drive toward Stephen Klaw, a man's voice rose in a
triumphant shout, hoarse and vindictive: "There she is!"</p>

<p>The man came tearing out from the park, a little farther down
the block. At the same time, two other men broke from cover, at
other points along the Drive. They had evidently been combing the
park for her. All three of them converged upon her. They had
peculiar weapons&mdash;the stocks resembled those of Thompson
sub-machine guns, but the barrels were sawed-off so that they were
only about six inches long.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw's lips pursed tightly when he saw those guns in the
hands of the three men. He spat the cigarette from his lips, and
thrust his hands down into his jacket pockets. They emerged almost
at once, each gripping an automatic.</p>

<p>The first of those three pursuing men dropped to one knee, and
aimed his sawed-off machine gun, while the other two raised their
weapons to their shoulders to fire as they ran. All three muzzles
were concentrated upon the back of the staggering woman. Either
they had not seen the slim, almost boyish figure of Stephen Klaw,
or else they did not connect him with their quarry.</p>

<p>Klaw's eyes were cold and hard as he fired both automatics from
the hip. The men on the extreme right and left of the running woman
fell as those two automatics began their spiteful, deadly barking.
They never even fired their weapons.</p>

<p>But the third, directly behind the woman, was shielded from Klaw
by her staggering body.</p>

<p>The fellow saw his advantage at once, and dropped flat on the
ground, raising his sawed-off machine gun and pulling the trip at
the same time. A burst of scattering lead belched from the mouth of
the vicious weapon, spreading over a radius of twenty feet,
something like the buckshot from a small gauge shotgun.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw had anticipated this tactic. There was only one
thing he could do, and he did it without reflection or hesitation.
Almost before his two automatics had ceased thundering, he launched
himself in a flying tackle, straight at the running woman. He
reached her a split instant before the sawed-off machine gun
belched forth its lead.</p>

<p>Klaw's shoulder struck the woman's legs and she fell over him,
landing so that his body was between her and the machine-gunner.
The spray of lead whistled through the air, just above their heads.
The man had fired high, evidently hoping to riddle the woman's body
from the waist up. Only a few of the pellets arced low enough to
strike Klaw, and he barely felt them as he fired his right-hand
automatic from his prone position on the ground. His slug took the
machine-gunner square in the forehead, and the man just relaxed and
lay still.</p>

<p>Stephen sprang to one knee and knelt beside the dark-haired
woman. She was trying feebly to stir. A moan escaped from her lips.
The wound in her breast was bleeding profusely, and though she had
escaped the leaden hail from the machine gun, Klaw could see at a
glance that she had not long to live. She raised a haggard face to
his.</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did they get you&mdash;too?"</p>

<p>He put a hand on her shoulder. "No. Only a few little nicks.
I'll be able to pluck them out, easily."</p>

<p>"Thank...God...you're safe. I knew...they were looking...for
me...in the park. But I had to...keep the appointment with you.
They got me...with a lucky shot when I escaped with the brief
case. I wouldn't have lasted...much longer..."</p>

<p>"I got the three of them," Stephen Klaw said grimly. "If that's
any consolation. Now, I'm going to call an ambulance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. I'm...through&mdash;done for. Take the brief case. It
contains the list...I promised to get for you. All the names of
the Executive Council...of...Skull and Swastika Corps!"</p>

<p>Klaw took the black leather case. He did not open it. He bent
low over the dying woman.</p>

<p>"You've done a great service for your country, Mary
Watson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no. It's only...small part. You...must do the...rest. I
got all names except the...leader's. His name was...Franz
Trebizond...in Germany. I don't know...what name he uses in this
country. That is for you...to find..."</p>

<p>The blood was pumping out of her body at an appalling rate. She
should have been dead, but she was clinging to life by a terrible
effort of naked will power.</p>

<p>"Look out for...Franz Trebizond. He is clever, ruthless&mdash;a
blond beast without mercy or heart. And watch for the woman, Lisa
Monterey. She is...bad as he..."</p>

<p>Mary Watson gasped, and a spasm went through her body. But she
held on to life for another moment, with a grim purposeful
effort.</p>

<p>"You must promise me...one thing more..."</p>

<p>"Anything you ask," Steve said.</p>

<p>"Promise to look after my daughter, Sue. They&mdash;the Skull
and Swastika Corps&mdash;will try to hurt her because of what I did
to them." She shuddered, and pressed a hand against her breast as
if to stem the tide of spilling blood for one instant more.
"I&mdash;I can't bear to think of Sue in the hands of those
monsters. They...know dreadful tortures...they know where to find
every living nerve in a girl's body. They would keep her in agony
for days and days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, they won't," Stephen Klaw said grimly. He took a deep
breath. "I give you my word, Mary Watson," he said solemnly, "and I
give you the word of Kerrigan and Murdoch too. The three of us will
see to it that nothing happens to Sue Watson&mdash;while we're
alive!"</p>

<p>A look of ineffable happiness came into the swiftly-dimming eyes
of Mary Watson, erasing the mask of pain from her features. Her
body relaxed, giving way at last to the sweet, blank nothingness of
death.</p>

<p>She lay still...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">2. CODE FOR KILLERS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">STEPHEN KLAW put a finger upon the artery in her
throat. There was no pulse, no life. Slowly, he picked up the brief
case, and rose to his feet. As he looked down upon the still body
of Mary Watson, there was a tight gray bleakness in his face, which
had not been there before.</p>

<p>Sounds arose about him, in the quiet night air. Fifty heads were
poked out of apartment house windows, and voices called out in
fright and in execration.</p>

<p>"There's the murderer...He killed the woman...It's the Skull
and Swastika again&mdash;I recognize those machine guns! Call the
police! Catch him! Catch the murderer!"</p>

<p>Men were running out of the corner house, others were coming
from up and down the street. From a ground floor window a man's
voice came clearly, high-pitched and keen: "Operator! Operator! Get
police headquarters! It's a killing! The Skull and Swastika..."</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw paid no attention to the shouts, to the people who
stared out of the window, or to those who were in the street. His
lips moved faintly as he stood over the body of the dark-haired
woman.</p>

<p>"I don't like leaving you here, Mary Watson, dead in the gutter.
But you were a brave woman. You would understand."</p>

<p>Instinctively, his right hand, holding the still-hot automatic,
rose to his forehead in mute salute. Then, with the brief-case
under his left arm, and an automatic in each hand, he turned and
strode away down the same side-street from which he had come. He
looked neither to the right nor to the left, walking as if all
those shouting, gesticulating, threatening people did not even
exist.</p>

<p>They kept their distance, too, for the sight of those dead
bodies on the ground, and of the automatics in his hands, was
enough to deter the boldest of them from attempting to stop
him.</p>

<p>But they yelled and they screamed, and they blasphemed against
him.</p>

<p>"Dammed Nazi," he heard. And, "He's a Skull and Swastika gunman.
Get the yellow rat!"</p>

<p>A grim smile of irony tugged at Stephen Klaw's lips, at the
thought that he should be reviled as a member of the vicious Fifth
Column organization which he was fighting to the death. But he
couldn't stop and explain to these people that he was an agent of
the F. B. I., acting sub rosa, and without official commission.
That was a secret between himself and his Chief. Yet he liked the
sound of those epithets which were flung at him, because it
reflected the temper of the American people. Americans were not
ones to accept the activities of such an organization, as people of
other countries had done, to their own cost.</p>

<p>These were the men and the descendants of men who had made
America great and strong. These were men who had fought in the last
world war, and who wanted only peace for this generation of their
sons. Yet they were ready and willing to hurl themselves unarmed,
against an armed enemy who was boring from within to destroy their
cherished institutions and their cherished liberty.</p>

<p>Klaw smiled, like a fond elder brother. He fired twice into the
air, then turned and took to his heels. It was the first time in
recorded history that Stephen Klaw had run from danger!</p>

<p>As police sirens shrilled in the distance, the pursuing crowd
raised a great shout. They had their man trapped. Steve knew well
enough, that once he were caught now, even those blue coats in the
police car would not be able to keep him from being battered to a
pulp by the fierce revengeful fists of his pursuers. There had been
too many hideous tortures and wanton killings in recent weeks on
the part of the Skull and Swastika Corps, and the citizens were out
for blood. He must escape quickly. He must reach the place where he
had left his car in the next side street.</p>

<p>Steve swung into an open lot, as he had previously planned. But
before he was halfway across the lot, a bullet whined past his
head, followed by another and another. The stentorian voice of one
of the blue coats in the police car bellowed after him. "Stop! Or
we'll shoot to kill!"</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw kept on running. He bent low from the waist,
holding tight to the brief case which Mary Watson had bequeathed to
him. He heard the police officer curse behind him, and shout, "All
right, you asked for it!"</p>

<p>Only then did Klaw throw himself forward at full length on the
ground. The policeman's gun bellowed, and a bullet screamed through
the air, followed by another and another in quick succession.</p>

<p>"He's down!" some one shouted. "You got him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naw!" yelled the cop. "He dropped before I fired."</p>

<p>Klaw jumped up, and started to run once more. He was almost into
the mouth of the alley now, with only a low fence intervening. He
hurdled the fence on the run, just as the cop fired again. He
almost felt the tug of that bullet against his coat as he went over
the fence into the alley beyond.</p>

<p>Now he raced through the alley out into the street beyond, with
the hue and cry rising behind him to a shrilling crescendo of fury.
His margin of safety was small, but it was enough for him. He was
in his car, and had it started before the first of the pursuing
throng came out into the street after him.</p>

<p>Without putting on his lights, he sent the car roaring away, and
turned the far corner on two wheels. A couple of desultory shots
followed him, but they were ineffective. In a moment he was away
from all pursuit.</p>

<p>He switched on his radio, and drove south on Broadway, listening
to the short wave alarms which were being broadcast for him. The
police were still under the impression that he was an operative of
the Skull and Swastika Corps, and they were instituting a thorough
man-hunt. But they didn't have the license of his car, nor the
make, for it had been too dark back there on that side street.
Neither did they have a good description of him.</p>

<p>Grimly he opened the briefcase as he drove. He was surprised to
find that it contained only a single sheet of paper, with a series
of hieroglyphics written in vertical columns, as the Chinese
write.</p>

<p>There were nine of these vertical lines, each containing from
fifteen to thirty characters. Glancing at it swiftly as he drove,
Klaw was unable to decide whether the characters were Chinese, or
some less known alphabet of Indo-China or Malaysia. But there was
no time to waste in deciphering this puzzle now. Mary Watson had
said that this paper contained the names of the Executive Council
of the Skull and Swastika, but not the present identity of Franz
Trebizond, which Klaw wanted more than anything else. But first,
there was one other thing which he must make sure of&mdash;a thing
for which he had pledged his word, and the word of his two
partners, Kerrigan and Murdoch.</p>

<p>When he reached the Eighties, he turned off and drove half way
down the block until he reached a small apartment house set between
a garage and a public playground. The playground was dark and
deserted now, but the garage was busy.</p>

<p>Klaw did not stop in front of the apartment house. He merely
glanced at it as he drove past, and swung his car into the garage.
A sign on the outside said: "PARKING&mdash;50 cents."</p>

<p>He left his car here, paid the fee and got a parking ticket.
Then he walked out, stood at the curb for a moment while he lit a
cigarette. He glanced up at the facade of the apartment house next
door, fixing his glance for an instant on the first-floor window
nearest the garage. There was a light in that window. He waited at
the curb, smoking the cigarette slowly. A minute passed. Then the
light was suddenly extinguished. It remained out for another full
minute, then went on again.</p>

<p>Steve threw away his cigarette, and entered the apartment house.
He avoided the elevator and went up the single flight of stairs to
the first floor. At the door of Apartment 1A he pressed the button
three times quickly, then twice, then once. The door was opened
immediately, and he stepped inside.</p>

<p>The girl who met him in the foyer was so breathtakingly lovely
that anyone who saw her once could never forget her. She was little
more than nineteen. The white oval of her face was set off by dark,
silky soft hair. And her resemblance to Mary Watson was so marked
that there could be no doubt she was the daughter of the woman who
had died on Riverside Drive a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Sue Watson said nothing as she closed the door behind Stephen
Klaw. She just stood in the foyer, her slim and graceful body taut,
her lower lip trembling. Her eyes bored deep into Steve's, as if
she would delve into his very soul.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she closed her eyes, and a little moan escaped from
her lips.</p>

<p>"Dead?" she asked. She opened her eyes and waited for the
answer.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw gulped, and bowed his head.</p>

<p>Sue Watson did not burst into tears. Her face became white, and
her hands clenched at her sides. She swayed just a little, and
Steve put forth a hand, then quickly withdrew it.</p>

<p>Silently, Sue Watson turned and led him into the living room.
She went to the window, pulled the blind all the way down. Then she
came and seated herself in a straight-backed chair facing Klaw.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it, Steve," she said in a tight little voice.
"I want to know how she died."</p>

<p>"She was a very brave woman, Sue," he told her. "She was
mortally wounded, yet she managed to make her way to the place
where she was to meet me. She brought the list of names&mdash;all
but Trebizond's. We still don't know what name Trebizond adopted
since coming to the United States."</p>

<p>Sue Watson's eyes widened. "Then&mdash;then she threw away her
life. She died in vain?"</p>

<p>"No!" Steve told her grimly. "Your mother did not die in vain.
We'll use that list to bring Trebizond out in the open. As soon as
Kerrigan and Murdoch get here, we'll go into action. Have they
called yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They called fifteen minutes ago from the airport. They'll
be here any minute. But&mdash;but how can just the three of you
fight the whole Skull and Swastika Corps? Won't the government help
you at all?"</p>

<p>"No. We're on our own. We're acting as private citizens.
Whatever we do is outside the law. There would be very little
chance of getting enough evidence against the S. S. Corps to
convict them in court. And even if we did, we couldn't afford to
reveal our methods and our information at a public trial."</p>

<p>"I see," she said slowly. "So you three are going to stick your
heads in the jackal's mouth&mdash;as usual!"</p>

<p>Klaw shrugged. "Your mother did it."</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, Mary Watson had been married to Franz
Trebizond, who had even then been a member of the Nazi minority
party in Germany. They had been divorced within a year, and Mary
Watson had married again, and forgotten that nightmare year, during
which she had learned just how much of a beast a man can be. When
her second husband was killed in an airplane accident, Mary Watson
had devoted her life to her two daughters, Sue and Eve. She had
relegated Franz Trebizond to the limbo of forgotten things, had
made a full life for herself in the busy duties of a mother.</p>

<p>But Franz Trebizond was not so easily disposed. In the
intervening years he had risen to power with the Nazi party, and
had become chief of the Bureau of Foreign Activity, directing Nazi
spies and saboteurs from his headquarters in Berlin. Unfortunately,
Mary Watson had not kept track of him. She had permitted Sue's
elder sister, Eve, to make a vacation trip across Europe, just
before the war broke out. Eve's itinerary had carried her through
Berlin. And there, Eve had disappeared.</p>

<p>A WEEK later, Eve's body was found in the Danube River. Mary
Watson, desperate with grief, began to pull wires and to seek
information from friends in Europe. Little by little, she learned
the story. Franz Trebizond had never forgotten her, never forgiven
her for marrying another man and having two beautiful daughters by
that other man. He had waited, and bided his time. It was he who
had ordered Eve Watson's murder. And he had made sure that Mary
Watson would hear of the circumstances.</p>

<p>There was nothing that Mary could do about it, until a few weeks
ago. She learned that Franz Trebizond, who had directed Fifth
Column activities in Holland, Belgium and South America, had come
at last to the United States to take over the active direction of
the Skull and Swastika Corps. She remembered that Trebizond had
owned an old house in New York, and guessed that he might use it as
headquarters. She had phoned Stephen Klaw, who was an old friend,
that she would make an attempt to enter that house and obtain
evidence. She had insisted, in spite of Steve's protests, that she
wanted to do the job alone&mdash;as a gesture of vengeance for the
murder of her daughter, Eve. And she had made the appointment to
meet him at the spot where she had died tonight.</p>

<p>Now, looking at Sue Watson sitting straight and taut, Stephen
Klaw remembered his promise to see that no harm came to this
beautiful girl. There would be a double reason why the Skull and
Swastika should go after her. The S. S. Corps was known for its
ruthless acts of vengeance, even unto the second generation. And
besides, the vindictiveness of Franz Trebizond would never be
satisfied until he had wiped out the entire family of Mary
Watson.</p>

<p>"You're sure," he asked her, "that this house is not being
watched?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," she told him, bitterly. "I've learned how to check
on things like that. I wouldn't have given you the signal with the
light if there had been any doubt. Mother and I have moved many
times in the last years&mdash;always a little ahead of Trebizond.
We cover our tracks."</p>

<p>Steve nodded. "Good. Then we can make our headquarters
here&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"If I don't mind!" Her eyes flashed. "Of course I don't! I want
to help in the fight!" her voice broke&mdash;"for Eve's and
Mother's sake!"</p>

<p>The telephone rang, and she sprang up to answer it. She spoke
for a moment, then hung up and turned to Klaw.</p>

<p>"It's Johnny Kerrigan and Dan Murdoch. They're in the drug store
around the corner. They're coming right up."</p>

<p>In less than five minutes, the bell rang, with the same signal
that Klaw had used. Sue Watson went to the door and admitted
Kerrigan and Murdoch.</p>

<p>They stepped swiftly inside, and grinned at Klaw. Klaw grinned
back at them.</p>

<p>"Hello, mopes," he said. "Hello, Shrimp," said Johnny Kerrigan.
"Hiya, Shrimp?" said Dan Murdoch. These three had worked together
for so long that they could almost read each other's minds. Long
ago, they had found that they had one thing in common&mdash;a
deliberate, willful, daredevil recklessness which made them always
seek the longest odds and the most dangerous tasks. As Special
Agents of the F. B. I., they were never assigned to routine jobs,
but got only those assignments from which there was little chance
of returning alive.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw had once told the chairman of a senate
investigating committee to go to hell when he had been asked why he
shot to kill in a battle with a criminal gang. Johnny Kerrigan had
once punched a senator's son in the nose. And Dan Murdoch had shot
a crooked croupier to death in a gambling dive.</p>

<p>For such acts, any other agents would have been summarily
dismissed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But the records
of those three were so outstanding that they were allowed to retain
their jobs&mdash;with this proviso: that they were never to be
assigned to ordinary duty where there might be a risk of offending
the powers-that-be. They were kept in reserve for the undertakings
for which the Chief of the F. B. I. would hesitate to order a
man.</p>

<p>THAT was the way Kerrigan and Murdoch and Klaw wanted it. They
were known as the Suicide Squad. Originally, there had been five of
them. Then four. Now there were but three, and tomorrow there might
be only two, one&mdash;or none. Only one thing was certain. If the
Suicide Squad died, they would die fighting to the last gasp.</p>

<p>"You get all the breaks, Shrimp!" Johnny Kerrigan growled. "Dan
and I were tied up in Washington, working on a secret code book
that was found on a dead guy last week, while you had the
excitement."</p>

<p>"How do you know I had excitement?" Steve demanded.</p>

<p>"I can see it in your eyes. And there are holes in your coat.
They weren't made by moths!"</p>

<p>"Nice work," said Steve. "Keep at it, and you'll make a
first-class detective some day."</p>

<p>Dan Murdoch came around and examined the holes in Steve's coat.
Some of them were darkly flecked with congealed blood.</p>

<p>"Buckshot!" said Murdoch. "Take off your coat, Shrimp. We'll
take out the pieces, and cauterize the holes. Do you want to get
tetanus?"</p>

<p>Kerrigan chuckled. "The buckshot is more likely to get tetanus,
if you ask me!"</p>

<p>Steve stripped off his coat and shirt and Sue Watson went into
the kitchen and boiled up a pot of water for sterilizing, and
brought in gauze and scissors and a knife.</p>

<p>There were seven pellets in Klaw's body, and it was painful work
removing them and cauterizing the small wounds. Kerrigan, for all
his bulk, had marvelously sensitive fingers. It was he who did the
work of extracting the lead, while Murdoch cauterized and
bandaged.</p>

<p>While they labored over him, Steve told them swiftly what had
happened on Riverside Drive, never even stopping to gasp when Dan
applied a red-hot knife to the wounds.</p>

<p>He finished his story, and showed them the paper he had taken
from Mary Watson's brief-case.</p>

<p>"If we could only work out this code," he said. "We'd have the
names of the Executive Council. It wouldn't give us Trebizond by a
long shot, because I'm sure that even the Executive Council doesn't
know the identity he's working under. But we could make use of
those names&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, seeing Kerrigan and Murdoch grinning at each
other.</p>

<p>"What's the joke, mopes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Murdoch. He took the paper and went to a
desk in the corner, turned on the light, and took a small notebook
from his pocket. He began working with pencil and paper while
Kerrigan finished up dressing Klaw's wounds.</p>

<p>In five minutes, Murdoch got up from the desk and came over with
a sheet of paper upon which he had written nine names.</p>

<p>"Johnny told you we were working on a code book, didn't he?
Well, we couldn't figure out which espionage organization was using
that code. Now we know. The characters on this paper you got, are
the same as the code book. It's the Skull and Swastika Code Book,
and here's the list of names of their Executive Council!"</p>

<p>Steve took the paper eagerly. Kerrigan looked at the names over
his shoulder, and whistled.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! They've got themselves in&mdash;solid!"</p>

<p>TWO of the names were those of political bosses who controlled a
large foreign vote. Four were city and state officials. The other
three were fairly well known business men of foreign
extraction.</p>

<p>"We could arrest them all, tonight!" exclaimed Kerrigan.</p>

<p>"Sure!" Stephen Klaw barked. "And they'd be released in the
morning for lack of evidence. This list wouldn't convict them in
court. We'd only be putting Trebizond on guard!"</p>

<p>"Also," Murdoch added, "it is to be remembered that we are
acting as private citizens, and not as Federal Agents." He
grimaced. "No, my dear Mr. Kerrigan, your idea is putrid!"</p>

<p>"How'll we handle it then?" Johnny growled.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw put his shirt and coat on, over his bandages.</p>

<p>"Watch me, mopes," he said. He turned to Sue Watson. "Is your
phone on the dial system?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes. Why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then they won't be able to trace the call back here."</p>

<p>He ran his finger down the list of names, and stopped at that of
Sylvester Gr&ouml;ner.</p>

<p>"I've heard of him," Murdoch said. "He runs a travel bureau.
Used to book personally conducted tours through Germany before the
war."</p>

<p>"He'll do!" said Klaw. He went over to the telephone stand,
looked up Gr&ouml;ner's home phone number, then dialed it.</p>

<p>Sue Watson looked blank and uncomprehending. But Kerrigan and
Murdoch, after glancing at each other, nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Maybe you've got something there, Shrimp!" Dan Murdoch
said.</p>

<p>Just then, Klaw got his connection. "Let me talk to Mr.
Gr&ouml;ner, please," he said. "My name? Just tell him it's Mr.
Black&mdash;Mr. James Black...No, Mr. Gr&ouml;ner doesn't know me.
But he'll certainly be glad to talk to me."</p>

<p>Steve held the phone for a moment, winking at the others. Then
he nodded as Sylvester Gr&ouml;ner's voice came over the wire.</p>

<p>"Yes?" they heard faintly. "What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gr&ouml;ner," Steve said swiftly, "I know where to lay my
hands on a certain list of names which was stolen from a certain
place tonight. The government would give a handsome reward for that
list, but I figure it's worth more to you. Say, a hundred thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and they thought that Gr&ouml;ner
had hung up. But then his voice was heard once more.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"You may call me Mr. Black. You can see I'm not bluffing, when I
tell you that your name is number seven on the list."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suit yourself, Mr. Gr&ouml;ner. I'd just as soon turn the list
over to the Government unless I can make some money out of it. If
you won't pay, why I'll just say good-by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!"</p>

<p>Steve held the wire, while there was another long pause. Then,
"Just who are you, Mr. Black?"</p>

<p>"Let us say," Steve said into the phone, "that I represent an
independent syndicate."</p>

<p>"International spies, eh?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Does it matter? Do you want to do business with me or
not?"</p>

<p>"You say you have this list in your possession?"</p>

<p>"No. But I will get it tomorrow afternoon. I must know now
whether you want to buy it. Otherwise, I will make other
arrangements."</p>

<p>Gr&ouml;ner's voice was hesitant. "I must consult someone else.
Give me an hour. Where can I get in touch with you?"</p>

<p>"You can't. But tomorrow, at exactly three-thirty in the
afternoon, I'll register at the Groton Hotel. You can contact me
there."</p>

<p>"You'll have the list with you?"</p>

<p>"No. But I'll be able to lay my hands on it, if you're ready to
do business. And now&mdash;good-by, Mr. Gr&ouml;ner!"</p>

<p>He hung up swiftly, and turned to face the others. "Think he'll
nibble, mopes?"</p>

<p>"Boy!" said Kerrigan. "I can just imagine how Gr&ouml;ner is
burning up the wires right now, to get in touch with Franz
Trebizond! Too bad we can't tap his wire!"</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty!" said Dan Murdoch; "Mustn't do anything
against the law!"</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">3. ALIASES CAN'T FOOL DEATH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AT exactly three-twenty the next afternoon,
Stephen Klaw entered the lobby of the Groton Hotel. He had no
baggage.</p>

<p>The lobby was busy, with people moving in and out of the
cocktail lounge at the left. Klaw paid no attention to those who
watched him as he passed. To all outward appearance, he might have
been totally unaware that his every move was observed from the
moment he stepped inside the door.</p>

<p>At the desk, he handed the clerk a ten dollar bill.</p>

<p>"Bath or shower, sir?" asked the clerk.</p>

<p>"Shower," said Steve. "And I want a room on an upper floor.
Anything from the fifteenth up."</p>

<p>"So you can enjoy the view of Central Park, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," Steve told him. "I may have to throw someone out the
window. I want him to have a long fall."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," the clerk said nervously. "That's a good joke, sir."
He took a key from the rack. "I can give you Room
one-nine-one-o&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay." Klaw picked up the pen, and signed the register: "James
Black, Washington, D.C."</p>

<p>While he was doing this, a woman in a black cloth coat with a
chinchilla collar came over to the desk and idly picked a travel
folder from the rack. She was a beautiful woman, with features so
sharp and perfect that they might have been chiseled from Carrara
marble by a master sculptor. Her gleaming yellow hair was arranged
in a halo around her head, beneath a small chinchilla hat which
matched the coat collar.</p>

<p>As she took the travel folder, her eyes darted across to the
register, and rested for a fleeting instant upon the name which
Stephen Klaw had signed. Then they flicked to the room number
stamped upon the key, which the clerk was handing to a bellhop.</p>

<p>A faint smile, tinged with irony, tugged at her full red lips.
She turned away from the desk and looked across the lobby, toward
two men who were standing near the elevator. Her fingers appeared
to be toying idly with the pearl necklace at her throat. In
reality, they were moving in the swift gestures of the
deaf-and-dumb sign language.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw, alias Mr. James Black, seemed to be busy lighting
a cigarette. But he did not miss the woman's actions, nor did he
fail to take note of the two men to whom she was signaling. His
face remained expressionless. Except for the sudden flicker of his
slate-gray eyes, he gave no sign that he had noticed anything. But
he saw those two men hurry into the elevator.</p>

<p>Without haste, he got his cigarette lit, accepted his change
from the clerk, and then proceeded to compare his wrist watch with
the electric clock over the desk. All this took only a couple of
minutes. But it was long enough for the elevator cage containing
those two men to reach its destination. Glancing at the indicator
Steve saw that it had stopped at nineteen. The woman with the
chinchilla collar moved across the lobby to the row of telephone
booths alongside the entrance to the cocktail lounge. She entered
one of them, and dialed a number, turning frequently to look back
toward Steve.</p>

<p>Steve grinned. He glanced at the bellhop, who was waiting
impatiently to take him upstairs.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, sonny," Steve said, and took the key out of the
boy's hand. He put it down on the desk. "I've changed my mind," he
told the clerk. "The nineteenth floor is a little too high. Have
you got anything on the eighteenth?"</p>

<p>The clerk sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, there's nothing wrong with the nineteenth, but if
you insist&mdash;" he replaced the key, and took another from the
rack&mdash;"here's the corresponding room on the eighteenth
floor."</p>

<p>"That's much better," Steve approved. Now he followed the boy
over to the elevators. The cage which had taken the two men up was
already descending, but there was another one waiting, and they
entered it. As the operator slid the door shut, Steve got a quick,
fleeting glimpse of the woman in the chinchilla-collared coat. She
was hurrying out of the phone booth, and making a bee line for the
desk, evidently in great excitement. She had left the telephone
receiver dangling by the cord in the booth, indicating that she had
not yet finished her conversation with whomever she had called. She
must have sensed that Stephen Klaw had pulled a fast one at the
desk, and she was losing no time in checking up.</p>

<p>KLAW chuckled. He saw the bellhop watching him, and he winked.
The boy grinned, and winked back. Stephen Klaw was not the type to
inspire fear or respect at first glance. He was so slim and wiry
that he looked hardly older than the bellboy. It was only when one
saw the cold glint in those slate-gray eyes of his that one must
instantly realize he was no kid.</p>

<p>The elevator reached the eighteenth floor, and Klaw followed the
uniformed lad down the carpeted hallway to 1810. The boy opened the
door, and they went in. Klaw took out a five dollar bill and gave
it to the lad.</p>

<p>"Gee, thanks, mister!" the kid gulped.</p>

<p>Klaw smiled. "This is just to show you who's your friend, sonny.
Now scram. Things will be getting hot here pretty soon."</p>

<p>He fairly thrust the lad out of the room, and shut the door. But
he was careful not to lock it.</p>

<p>He glanced at his wrist watch, and saw that it was exactly three
o'clock. Almost at once, the telephone rang. He went to the night
table and picked it up.</p>

<p>"James Black speaking," He said.</p>

<p>A familiar voice answered. "Hello, Mr. Black. This is Mr.
White."</p>

<p>Steve grinned. Nobody who had ever heard that deep, stentorian
voice of big Johnny Kerrigan could ever mistake it again for
another. Kerrigan was the second of that triumvirate of daredevils
who had come to be known in the F. B. I. as the Suicide Squad. The
third was Dan Murdoch. Where one of them appeared, the other two
were sure to be somewhere in the offing. They worked together like
the well-oiled mechanism of a precision machine. The combination of
Kerrigan, Murdoch and Klaw was one which the mightiest of felons
had grown to fear.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw chuckled into the phone. "How are you doing, Mr.
White?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad, Mr. Black. I was behind that newspaper in the
corner of the lobby when you came in. I watched the dame go in to
phone. When she came dashing out, I stepped into the next booth,
and traced the call. So now I know to whom she is reporting."</p>

<p>"Excellent work, Mr. White. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. She scrammed back into her booth and finished up her
conversation in a hurry, and then she phoned up to Room
One-nine-one-o. She was so excited that I could hear what she said.
She told the two bozos in there that you had switched rooms, and
that they should go to Room Eighteen-ten and tackle you at once.
They must be on the way down right now."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. White. I've left my door unlocked for them."</p>

<p>"Watch yourself, Shrimp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nuts to you, Mr. White. Hang up, please. I expect a call from
Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"Okay, Shrimp. Good-by."</p>

<p>Klaw put the phone down, glanced at his wrist watch, and waited
at the telephone stand, with his back to the door. He kept his
right hand dug deep down in his coat pocket, and his left was on
the phone. His wrist watch showed four minutes after three.</p>

<p>He heard his doorknob creak slightly as it was tried from
outside, but he did not turn around. He kept his eyes on the
second-hand of his watch. When it had made a complete revolution,
bringing the time to three-five, the phone rang once more. He
picked it up and said, "Mr. Black speaking."</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Black," came Dan Murdoch's voice. "This is Mr.
Green. I have those papers for you. Will you meet me at the usual
place?"</p>

<p>"Louder," said Stephen Klaw.</p>

<p>He knew that the door was opening behind him, because he was
standing in such a way that he could see the dresser mirror out of
the corner of his eye. He glimpsed a long thin face, with a small
moustache. It was the face of one of the two men who had been in
the lobby and who had hurried up to Room 1910. The man was pushing
the door carefully, squeezing his body through the opening. He had
a small Smith &amp; Wesson automatic pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>Steve took no notice. He held the French phone at his ear, and
repeated, "Louder, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>Over the wire, Dan Murdoch's voice whispered, "Did they rise to
the bait, Shrimp?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are they in the room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Okay, Shrimp, here goes." Murdoch raised his voice.</p>

<p>"THIS IS MR. GREEN," he shouted. "I HAVE THOSE PAPERS FOR YOU.
IF YOU WILL MEET ME AT THE USUAL PLACE, I'LL DELIVER THEM TO
YOU!"</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Green. I'll meet you there in fifteen minutes.
Good-by."</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw put the phone down, still with his right hand in
his coat pocket. As if casually, he put his left hand in his other
pocket. He turned around and faced the two men who had come into
the room. Neither of them looked dangerous, except for the weapons
in their hands. The first, with his small, well-kept moustache and
thin, almost aristocratic face, might have been a banker or a
director of a large corporation. The second was soft, and a bit
paunchy, with a round, good-natured face, and could have passed for
a genial neighborhood doctor.</p>

<p>The stout man pushed the door shut behind him with a poke of his
elbow, while the one with the moustache bowed from the hips.</p>

<p>"Mr. Black," he said, in faultless, painstaking English which
betrayed the fact that he was a foreigner of excellent education.
"I must beg your pardon for this unceremonious entrance. But the
urgency of our business with you must serve as an excuse. In our
profession&mdash;" he jerked his head toward his stout companion,
who beamed&mdash;"and in yours, there is a motto to the effect that
the end justifies the means."</p>

<p>"I see," Stephen Klaw said dryly. "And what is it you want?"</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see that you are a reasonable man, Mr. Black.
Permit me to introduce myself. I am&mdash;Mr. Smith. And
this&mdash;" nodding in the direction of the stout man&mdash;"is
Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," said Steve.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones both kept their automatics carefully
pointed at Klaw's stomach.</p>

<p>"We just heard you making an appointment over the phone with a
certain Mr. Green. You are going to meet him, and he is going to
turn over to you a certain list of names. Not so?"</p>

<p>"You're doing the talking," Steve said noncommittally.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith shrugged. "Please do not make it hard for us. We know
that your name is not Black, and that your friend's name is not
Green, just as you know that our names are not Smith and Jones. Let
us not beat around the bush. Mr. Jones and I are members of the S.
S. Corps. You know, naturally, what the S. S. Corps
represents?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of it," Steve lied, with a straight face.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith sighed. He looked sideways at Mr. Jones, taking care
not to let his gun muzzle waver from Stephen Klaw's stomach.</p>

<p>"Show him just who we are, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>The stout Mr. Jones showed all his teeth in a hearty, genial
smile. "It will be a pleasure, indeed!"</p>

<p>Keeping his gun trained on Steve, he used his left hand to turn
back the lapel of his coat. A glittering button was fastened to
it.</p>

<p>"You will recognize this emblem, Mr. Black," he said, and moved
up closer, thrusting the lapel out to bring the button nearer to
Steve's eyes.</p>

<p>It was about the size of a quarter, and made of some sort of
black, polished onyx. Upon its surface was carved a gleaming silver
skull, and super imposed upon the skull there was a golden
swastika.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Steve, acting as if a great light had just dawned
upon him. "S. S.&mdash;Skull and Swastika. I recognize it now!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" beamed Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>MR. SMITH stepped forward so that he was alongside of Mr. Jones.
He pushed the muzzle of his gun up against Steve's diaphragm.</p>

<p>"It will do you no good to pretend ignorance, Mr. Black. We of
the Skull and Swastika Corps are not fools. We know that you belong
to the government, and that your real name is Stephen Klaw. We know
that you have come here to contact a certain Mr. Green, whose real
name is Murdoch. He is to turn over to you a list of the Executive
Council of the S. S. Corps. We just heard you making an appointment
to meet him."</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw kept his hands in his pockets, and gazed bleakly at
those two.</p>

<p>"You're pretty well-informed, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Extremely so. And we might as well tell you that we are
prepared to go to any lengths to keep that list of names from
falling into the hands of the United States Government."</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith wiggled his gun, and shrugged. "Murder and
further!"</p>

<p>Steve raised his eyebrows. "What's further than murder?"</p>

<p>Mr. Smith gestured impatiently with his automatic. "Please don't
waste time. Surely you remember the newspaper stories of the girl
who was found last week with her tongue cut out, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember," Steve said hastily. There was a queer, flickering
light in his eyes "That was Estelle Frazer. She had just come back
from Germany, and she was scheduled to appear before a Senate
Investigating Committee, to tell certain secrets she had learned
there."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Mr. Smith. "But she never talked. She begged to
be killed quickly, Mr. Black. There have been others, too."</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw's eyes were no longer flickering. They were cold
and hard. His hands, still dug deep in his pockets, were
motionless. He asked quietly&mdash;almost too quietly: "So it was
you two gentlemen who tortured her, and then left her mutilated
body to be found?"</p>

<p>Mr. Jones beamed. "Exactly, exactly. It served as an example of
the power of the Skull and Swastika Corps. Now you, Mr. Klaw, can
save yourself a great deal of bodily pain by disclosing to us the
place where you were to meet Mr. Green. We will go instead, and
relieve him of the list."</p>

<p>"And what happens to me?" Klaw asked.</p>

<p>"As soon as we have the list safe," Mr. Jones promised
unctuously, "we will let you go."</p>

<p>"You lie," said Stephen Klaw. "You've just confessed to me that
you tortured and murdered Estelle Frazer. You can't afford to let
me live."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones was about to protest, but Mr. Smith stopped him. He
nodded sympathetically at Steve.</p>

<p>"That is true. The best we can promise you is a quick death.
Speak now, and tell us where you are to meet Murdoch, and we will
kill you mercifully with a bullet. If you refuse, we will have
to&mdash;ah&mdash;make your last hours on earth a nightmare of
agony. Do not doubt that we can do it. We have already told you
about Estelle Frazer. There have been others. We have men
downstairs in the lobby, whom we can bring up. They have all the
necessary paraphernalia. We will hang out a 'Do Not Disturb' sign,
and proceed to work on you at our leisure."</p>

<p>"That," said Stephen Klaw, "is all I wanted to know!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mr. Smith. "Do you mean that you
will talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Steve. "I mean that I will shoot!"</p>

<p>He fired both automatics in his coat pockets, without removing
them. He merely thrust the muzzles up as far as they would go, and
pulled the triggers. The bullets scorched the cloth of his coat.
The explosions were low, muffled. The slugs&mdash;one from each
gun&mdash;struck Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones as accurately as if he had
aimed carefully and painstakingly. He got each of them in the right
arm, just above the elbow.</p>

<p>And then, a very curious thing happened. Steve had aimed
deliberately at the gun arm of both men, because he knew that they
would pull the triggers of their own weapons, even if only by
reflex action. He had hoped that the driving force of his own shots
would swing them around, so that he would not be hit.</p>

<p>In this he was correct. But Mr. Smith who was standing at the
right of Mr. Jones, was whirled around in such fashion that his
back was turned to the stout and genial Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>Both guns went off at almost the same instant, echoing Steve's
two shots. Mr. Smith's shot went harmlessly into the wall, but Mr.
Jones's slug smashed squarely into Mr. Smith's back.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith toppled forward, blood gushing from his mouth. He fell
against the wall, then slid to the floor, and remained there,
motionless.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones gazed at his dead confrere, as if spellbound. His
right arm hung limp at his side, and the automatic which had driven
and killed Smith fell from his numbed hand. He uttered a choked cry
of rage, and stopped to pick up the gun with his left hand.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw sighed, and hit him once behind the ear with the
butt of his reversed automatic.</p>

<p>The stout Mr. Jones fell across the body of Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Steve bent and pulled the unconscious Jones off the body of
Smith, and maneuvered around till he got the man's coat off.
Jones's arm was bleeding profusely. Steve didn't bother to stop and
examine it. He went to the bed and yanked a sheet off, tore it into
strips, and tied it as tightly as he could around Jones's arm,
above the wound, in the form of a rough tourniquet. Then, to make
sure that Mr. Jones would not wake up and go away from there, Steve
handcuffed him to the bed.</p>

<p>He went methodically through the pockets of both men, removing
everything he found, including the black-lacquered
Skull-and-Swastika buttons. He had just about finished, when the
telephone rang again. He picked it up, and was greeted by Johnny
Kerrigan's voice.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Black, how you doing?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing all right, Mr. White. I had two visitors."</p>

<p>"How do they feel now?"</p>

<p>"One of them is past all feeling. The other isn't interested. I
have two of the buttons."</p>

<p>"Very nice work, Mr. Black. Come on down. The lady with the
yellow hair and the chinchilla collar is getting restless. I can
see her from the phone booth here, and she's biting her
fingernails."</p>

<p>"Is she alone?"</p>

<p>"Not much. There's at least half a dozen bozos in here that are
taking orders from her. Those two you interviewed upstairs were
only a scouting force."</p>

<p>Steve grinned. "I'll be right down!"</p>

<p>He hung up and hurried out of the room. On the way he picked up
the "Do Not Disturb" sign, and hung it on the knob. He made sure
the door was locked and went down the hall to the elevator. Once
more he slipped both hands into his coat pockets...</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">4. BROKEN PROMISE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE lobby was just as busy as it had been ten
minutes ago, but with this difference&mdash;there was an air of
tense expectancy which somehow seemed to charge the atmosphere with
latent dynamite.</p>

<p>Stepping out of the elevator, Stephen Klaw threw a swift,
comprehensive glance around, seeking to orientate himself to all
the focal points of danger. He spotted Johnny Kerrigan, still in
the telephone booth, engrossed in a mythical conversation over the
wire. Johnny had his lips close to the mouthpiece, with the
receiver at his ear, and was going through all the motions of
talking, but he was in reality keeping a sharp weather eye out on
the occupants of the lobby.</p>

<p>Johnny nodded almost imperceptibly in the direction of the
cocktail lounge, and Steve looked in that direction and saw the
tall, slender figure of Dan Murdoch, seated at the bar in there and
sipping his inevitable Scotch-and-soda. From where Murdoch sat he
had a clear view of the lobby, and there was nothing between him
and the hotel foyer to obstruct the possible line of fire in the
event of trouble.</p>

<p>Murdoch winked over his highball glass, but Steve Klaw did not
return the wink.</p>

<p>Steve got that much of the picture as he stepped out of the
elevator cage. Next, he switched to the lobby itself.</p>

<p>The yellow-haired woman with the chinchilla collar was seated in
an easy chair, with her long silk-stockinged legs crossed, smoking
a cigarette through a thin ivory holder. When she saw Steve, she
almost dropped the holder. She started to get up. Then she let
herself sink back into the chair as she saw Stephen Klaw coming
straight across the lobby toward her.</p>

<p>Steve had his hands in his pockets. He was walking slowly,
deliberately. He had spotted at least a half dozen men in the
lobby, who looked as if they might be the ones to whom Kerrigan had
referred when he said that the woman had more help at hand. There
were two near the cigar counter, two at the desk, and one apiece at
the elevator doors and at the street entrance. Whether or not there
were more, he could not tell. But after the first quick glance of
reconnaissance, he did not look again in the direction of those
men. His whole attention was centered upon the woman, for he was
sure that nothing would happen here until she gave the signal.</p>

<p>He stopped squarely in front of her and looked down, smiling.
For a brief, fleeting moment, he glimpsed a flicker of emotion in
her eyes. Whether it was fear, hate or consternation, he could not
tell. Then she dropped long-lashed lids to veil her eyes. She
returned his smile. She took a long puff of the cigarette through
the ivory holder, and allowed the smoke to trickle out through
pursed lips.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Black?" she said in a low,
throaty voice.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Lisa Monterey," Stephen Klaw said levelly.</p>

<p>A quick spasm of surprise passed across her cameo features. The
long fingers on the ivory cigarette holder tautened.</p>

<p>"You know my name?"</p>

<p>"Of course. We've known for a long time that you were an agent
of the Skull and Swastika Corps. In fact, the F. B. I. knows almost
as much about you as you do, yourself. For instance, we know that
you worked for two years in the Balkans as an agent of the Nazis,
under the notorious Franz Trebizond. Then, when Trebizond went to
South America, you accompanied him. Now that Trebizond has been
ordered to the United States to direct Fifth Column activities, you
are his chief lieutenant. We even have a list of all the aliases
you've used. In Rumania, you were Dora Caminescu. In Holland, you
were Maria Nordlung. In Paraguay, you were Lisa Monterey. You kept
that last name when you came here, because it was too difficult to
get another passport."</p>

<p>She was leaning forward in her chair now, staring at him. "Do
you know the name my chief is using in America?"</p>

<p>"Franz Trebizond? No. We don't know yet. But give us a little
more time. We've just started to work on the Skull and Swastika
Corps."</p>

<p>Her lips curled scornfully. "You are a fool for telling me all
this, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Black. If I am really in the employ of
Franz Trebizond, as you imply, what is to prevent me from warning
him at once?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Steve told her grimly. "In fact, I want you to warn
him. I want you to give him a message from me&mdash;Stephen
Klaw."</p>

<p>SLOWLY, she arose from the chair. Standing, she was almost regal
in carriage and manner. But there was a certain nervous tension
about her which Steve detected from the rapid heaving of her
breast.</p>

<p>"I admit nothing. You are only talking for the purpose of
trapping me into an admission. Then you would arrest me."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Steve said, grinning. "I could arrest you
now, upon the evidence I have. It was you who sent those two
pleasant gentlemen up to interview me in Room Eighteen-ten. That's
enough to hold you on. But it isn't you I want. It's Franz
Trebizond. Go and tell him that Stephen Klaw gives him twenty four
hours to get out of the country!"</p>

<p>Lisa Monterey laughed. "You talk very big, Mr. Stephen Klaw. But
what can you do? You don't even know where Franz Trebizond is to be
found. You don't know what name he uses in this country."</p>

<p>"I'll know all that before midnight," he told her. "One of the
two kind gentlemen who visited me upstairs, is still alive. He told
me how he intended to make me talk. I'll use the same method with
him. And it will work!"</p>

<p>The woman's eyes flashed. "You are wrong, Mr. Stephen Klaw," she
murmured. "Oh, you are very wrong. You will make no one talk. You
are practically a dead man now!"</p>

<p>As she finished talking, she sprang away from Klaw, and began to
run toward the street entrance. At the same time she did something
with her finger to the ivory cigarette holder, and then applied it
to her lips. She blew a great gust of breath into it, and the
shrill note of a whistle emanated from the holder.</p>

<p>That whistle was the signal for which her men had been waiting.
As if magically, guns appeared in their hands, the muzzles swinging
with murderous certainty to center upon the slim figure of Stephen
Klaw.</p>

<p>He did not turn to run, neither did he seek cover.</p>

<p>There was a faint smile upon his lips as both his hands came out
of the jacket pockets, the two automatics barking in a rhythmic
melody of doom. He held them close to his hips, firing from that
position. He did not shoot with frantic speed or with jerky
desperation, as a man might be expected to do when he is attacked
by superior numbers. Instead, he fired each shot deliberately,
carefully, never missing. He swiveled slowly, as lead whined past
his head. His first two shots caught the two men at the desk, and
then he turned his fire on those at the cigar counter. He paid no
attention to the one at the street entrance or to the one at the
elevator doors.</p>

<p>He had no need to, for they were being well taken care of by Dan
Murdoch, who had come out of the cocktail lounge with both his
heavy revolvers spitting and roaring.</p>

<p>The hotel lobby reverberated to the thunder of deadly gunfire,
and the rolling clouds of sound echoed back from the walls and
ceiling with the shattering force of a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>Screams of frightened women, and the hoarse shouts of frantic
men formed a ghastly chorus to the deep-throated roar of the guns.
Patrons ran about blindly, seeking safety from the whistling,
shrieking leaden bolts of death. A man, nicked in the ear by a
stray bullet, clapped both hands to his head and shouted that he
was dying.</p>

<p>In a matter of moments, the bustling, peaceful lobby was
transformed into an inferno of terror and panic. Those six gunmen
of the Skull and Swastika Corps lay dead on the floor. The shooting
was over, but the panic grew. A milling, seething throng of men and
women fought to gain the exits.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw remained standing for a moment in the middle of the
lobby, watchful for the appearance of other gunmen. Dan Murdoch,
tall and lithe, stood poised in the doorway of the cocktail lounge,
a smoking revolver in each hand. The two of them glanced across at
each other, and they both nodded. The battle was over. Murdoch
sheathed his revolvers; Klaw slipped his hot automatics back into
his coat pockets. They both turned to look for Kerrigan.</p>

<p>In that shouting, stampeding throng, they could not find him. He
was no longer in the telephone booth. There was no sign of him
anywhere.</p>

<p>Neither was there any sign of Lisa Monterey!</p>

<p>POLICE whistles were keening shrilly, outside. A siren was
shrieking somewhere, and rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>Klaw slid through the throng, and reached Murdoch's side.</p>

<p>"Let's go, mope," he said. "We don't want to answer any police
questions now!"</p>

<p>"What about Johnny?" Murdoch asked.</p>

<p>"He must have tailed the Monterey woman out of here. That was
his end of the job. Let's move fast. We have a little job of our
own to attend to upstairs!" Dan Murdoch followed him through the
lobby to the rear, then down a flight of stairs to the service
basement. They found an elevator here, deserted by its operator who
had no doubt left his post to see the excitement upstairs.</p>

<p>Klaw and Murdoch got into it, and Steve sent the cage scooting
up to the eighteenth floor. He unlocked the door of 1810, and
pointed silently to the prostrate form of the stout Mr. Jones, who
was just recovering consciousness from the blow on the head. Jones
was still groggy, and hardly knew what was happening to him as Klaw
unlocked the handcuffs fastening him to the bed.</p>

<p>It was mute testimony to the efficiency with which the Suicide
Squad worked together, that no word of explanation or instruction
was necessary between Klaw and Murdoch now. Murdoch knelt and slung
the stout man over his shoulder, and then followed Steve out of the
room. Steve closed the door once more, leaving the "Do Not Disturb"
sign on the knob, so that the body of Mr. Smith would not be found
for a while. Then they made their way down the corridor back to the
service elevator.</p>

<p>Down in the basement, Klaw went out first, reconnoitering the
lay of the land. There was no one down here, but they could hear
the shouts of the police up above, trying to quiet the
panic-stricken crowd in the lobby, and find out just what had
happened.</p>

<p>Steve whistled for Murdoch to follow him, and made his way to
the back of the basement where there was a loading platform for
trunks and baggage. Outside the platform stood a hotel station
wagon, empty.</p>

<p>Murdoch dumped the stout Mr. Jones into the rear, and cuffed him
to the doorframe. Then he and Klaw climbed into the cab, with Klaw
behind the wheel. The key was in the switch, ready for the next
trip, and Klaw grinned as he turned it on.</p>

<p>"It's nice of the Hotel Groton to provide an easy getaway like
this for us!"</p>

<p>"Lay off the jabber and get going, Shrimp," Dan Murdoch growled.
"The police will be around here in a minute." Klaw nodded and
stepped on the starter. He gave her the gas, and they rolled out of
the alley into the street.</p>

<p>A great crowd was collected fifty feet up the block, in front of
the hotel entrance. No one even noticed the station wagon as it
turned left to the corner and swung north on Broadway.</p>

<p>Klaw drove slowly, without making any effort to throw off
possible pursuit.</p>

<p>"The bird in back," he told Murdoch, "gave the name of Jones.
He's an agent of the Skull and Swastika Corps, and he's one of the
devils who tortured poor Estelle Frazer before they killed
her."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Dan Murdoch.</p>

<p>"Our job," Klaw went on, "is to get the Skull and Swastika Corps
to come out in the open. So far, we've done pretty good. They fell
hook, line and sinker, for the story that I was to pick up a list
of the names of their executive council. But this is only the
beginning. If we can't bring Franz Trebizond out into the open, we
fail. I figure that by holding on to Mr. Jones, we can do it."</p>

<p>Murdoch nodded. "Trebizond will be afraid that Jones may talk.
And he'll try to get him out of our hands."</p>

<p>"Or knock him off. Either way, it's Trebizond's move next."</p>

<p>"Unless my eyesight fails me," Dan Murdoch said, looking to the
left, past Steve, "Trebizond is making his next move already!"</p>

<p>Steve glanced out of his window, and saw what Murdoch meant.</p>

<p>A long, two-toned town car had drawn abreast of them. The lower
part of the body was black, the upper, maroon. A uniformed
chauffeur was at the wheel, and a second man in uniform sat beside
him. In the rear of the car were two more men, and a woman.</p>

<p>A SINGLE glance was enough to tell Steve Klaw that the woman was
Lisa Monterey. Though he was not able to distinguish her features
in the interior of the car, he spotted the light chinchilla collar
and the silver chinchilla hat. She was sitting on the far side of
the seat. One of the men was seated beside her, and the other
occupied a folding seat just in front of her. This latter one was
holding a small, sawed-off sub-machine gun, with the foreshortened
muzzle poking out of the window straight at Klaw. His face was down
low, sighting along the barrel, and his finger was on the trip.</p>

<p>Those particular weapons had never been used in the United
States until introduced by the Skull and Swastika Corps. The
infernal Franz Trebizond had brought them over with him, and they
proved a most effective means of terrorization. Anyone who was
inclined to inform against the Skull and Swastika was sure to
change his mind when he read how the victims of those sawed-off
shotguns lived for two or three days, enduring the most agonizing
of torture from the multitudinous wounds, and then dying.</p>

<p>The second man, seated beside Lisa Monterey, had another of the
vicious weapons, which he was aiming from inside the car. The
careful planning which had gone into this attack was
evident&mdash;for the two machine-gunners were so placed that it
was almost impossible to shoot them both at the same time. If, by
some miracle, Klaw or Murdoch should succeed in hitting one of
them, the other could pull the trigger of his machine gun, riddling
them both with the same burst.</p>

<p>Klaw took in the situation at a glance as Murdoch whispered
fiercely, "They've got us cold, Shrimp. But Johnny's supposed to be
tailing that dame."</p>

<p>Klaw nodded, gripping the wheel. The limousine was swiftly
pulling ahead of them, bringing the two machine-gunners directly
abreast of Klaw and Murdoch. In another moment, they would be in
position to fire.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw stepped all the way down on the gas, and the
station wagon spurted forward. Luckily, there wasn't much traffic
on Broadway at this time of the afternoon, and there was a clear
lane ahead. But the chauffeur of the limousine had been watching
for just such a move, and he matched Steve's effort. The limousine
thrust forward, and started to gain on the station wagon. The two
cars sped up Broadway with roaring exhausts, in a death-race. There
was hardly twelve inches of space between them as the long snout of
the limousine began to edge out in front of the station wagon,
bringing the machine-gunners slowly and surely into firing
position. Ahead glowed a red traffic light, and a police officer at
the corner was madly waving a hand to them to stop, while he tugged
his revolver out with the other.</p>

<p>Dan Murdoch had a gun in each hand now, but he couldn't get in
position to fire past Steve at the machine-gunners. Everything
depended now on whether Klaw could keep the station wagon from
falling another foot behind the limousine. He was keeping his eyes
fixed on the street ahead, driving with every faculty alert and
feeding her every ounce of gas that she would take. They flashed
past the corner, and the cop jumped out of the way just in the nick
of time. Then the two cars were racing up toward Columbus Circle,
neck-and-neck, but with the limousine gaining by inches&mdash;and
inches were all it needed.</p>

<p>Murdoch's dark and handsome face was set and grim. He swung
around in the seat, and leaned far back, stretching his left arm
out behind Steve's head to aim at one of the machine-gunners. But
the wooden paneling of the station wagon was so high that it shut
off his view of those two. There was no way for him to get at them
until they came up abreast of the cab, and by then it would be too
late.</p>

<p>Quietly he said, "I'm stymied, Shrimp. You'll have to crash
them."</p>

<p>IT WAS typical of the utter confidence they had in each other,
that Klaw asked no further questions, taking it for granted that
what Murdoch said was so. Crashing that other car was the last
thing in the world they wanted. It would mean surrendering their
prisoner to the police, for they could never hope to spirit him
away from an accident on Broadway, as they had from the Groton
Hotel.</p>

<p>Their orders from Washington had been strict. They must operate
as an independent army of three, a sort of private Blitzkrieg
against the Skull and Swastika Corps. They must not seek the help
of the local police, or of the local F.B.I. office. Nothing they
did could be official, for the diplomatic repercussions would be
beyond calculation.</p>

<p>Besides, the Skull and Swastika Corps was known to have
tentacles reaching into many key posts in the police and judiciary.
Not so long ago, an important public servant had felt impelled to
go on the radio to deny rumors that he was sympathetic to the S. S.
Corps. As a matter of fact, that official was a loyal American of
French extraction, who hated the Skull and Swastika, and everything
it stood for. But he had a father, mother, two sisters and a
brother in occupied France, and he knew that if he did not obey
orders from Franz Trebizond, his relatives would be tortured
mercilessly. So, once the stout Mr. Jones fell into the hands of
the police, there was a good chance that Trebizond might get him
out of custody.</p>

<p>That was why the Suicide Squad had been assigned to this job. If
they came to grief on this assignment, there would be no support
for them from the Department of Justice. They would be disowned,
and they would swear up and down that they had been acting in a
private capacity, and not as agents of the United States
Government.</p>

<p>All this was in the mind of Stephen Klaw as he twisted the wheel
to crash the station wagon into the limousine. And he knew that it
was also in the mind of Dan Murdoch. But he knew too, that Murdoch
would never have ordered it unless it were supremely necessary.
Therefore, he complied without question.</p>

<p>The two cars met with a crashing, rending sound of tearing metal
as the left front fender of the station wagon tore into the right
fender of the limousine. Both cars swerved out over to the
southbound lane, but neither stopped. The chauffeur of the
limousine was pouring gas into his motor, just as Stephen Klaw was
doing, each making a supreme effort to pull ahead of the other. The
purpose of the limousine was to bring those sawed-off machine guns
abreast of Klaw and Murdoch, while Steve's purpose was to get as
far ahead as possible, to be out of range of the vicious weapons,
and to give Murdoch a chance to use his revolvers.</p>

<p>The Broadway crowd, rendered blas&eacute; by years of stunt
attractions calculated to pry it loose from its money, was treated
to the free spectacle of a tug-of-war between two automobiles, with
death as the prize for the loser.</p>

<p>The cars were locked together inextricably by their fenders, and
it became evident in a moment that neither could pull ahead of the
other. Klaw and Murdoch realized this at the same moment as the
killers in the limousine. The yellow-haired Lisa Monterey screamed
to her two gunners to shoot, and the men thrust their murderous
machine guns far out of the window, with their fingers on the
trips. They were going to blast through the partition of the
station wagon.</p>

<p>Dan Murdoch smashed the glass behind the driver's seat, and
literally leaped through into the tonneau, landing on hands and
knees. Then he was up in a split-second, both his revolvers
thundering.</p>

<p>He fired six times swiftly with each gun at point-blank range
into the faces of the two machine-gunners, at the same time that
Steve Klaw, abandoning the wheel leaned far out of his window and
began to pump both his automatics.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whose slugs killed those machine-gunners first.
Klaw had inserted new clips in his automatics, and he emptied nine
shots from each into the killers, while Murdoch fired twelve times
with his two revolvers. And neither of them missed with a single
shot.</p>

<p>The faces of the two machine-gunners disintegrated under that
blasting barrage. And at the same time, Lisa Monterey opened the
far door of the limousine and stepped out into the street. She
lifted up her dress and dashed away. Her chauffeur and footman also
took to their heels.</p>

<p>Klaw and Murdoch saw her go, but they were unable to stop her.
Their guns were empty, and by the time they could get out of the
station wagon and take after her, she would have plenty of time to
disappear in the crowd. Lisa Monterey was making good her
escape!</p>

<p>But now, another factor entered the picture. The big, hulking
figure of Johnny Kerrigan came leaping out of a taxicab fifty feet
behind, and made after the yellow-haired woman. He overtook her in
a half dozen strides.</p>

<p>That was all Klaw and Murdoch had a chance to see. Their own
position was precarious. The traffic cop was running up from the
corner, and a crowd was beginning to form, which would cut off all
escape for them. The prisoner could no longer be kept. They must
leave him to the police.</p>

<p>"I say we scram out of here, Shrimp!" Murdoch yelled, above the
clamor of the throng and the eddying echo of the gunfire.</p>

<p>Steve nodded. They both leaped out of the station wagon, and ran
headlong into the gathering crowd, away from the approaching
cop.</p>

<p>The crowd melted away from them at sight of their guns. Klaw and
Murdoch were the only ones who knew that those guns were empty.</p>

<p>They reached the opposite sidewalk with the cop shouting behind
them, and afraid to shoot lest he hit an innocent bystander.</p>

<p>"Down there!" shouted Steve, pointing to the subway kiosk at the
corner.</p>

<p>They both dived down the stairs as the thunderous rumble of a
local subway train sounded, rolling into the station below. Klaw,
in the lead, hurdled the turnstiles without paying his nickel, and
Dan Murdoch followed at his heels. They made the train by a half
second, and heard the door slam shut behind them. The train started
to move, and they turned and looked out at the sweating, cursing
cop who came tearing into the station after them.</p>

<p>At the next local station they got out and raced up the stairs
to the street, hailing a taxicab and pulling away only a moment
before the siren of an approaching police car sounded, a block
away. The alarm had gone out fast, but they had beaten it by the
margin of a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>They left their cab after riding it three or four blocks, and
took another. They changed cabs three times before they ventured to
approach the neighborhood of Sue Watson's apartment house. In the
last cab they reloaded their guns, then dismissed the taxi two
blocks away and walked the rest of the distance.</p>

<p>The light was on in the first floor window, and the blind was
down.</p>

<p>Steve nudged Dan Murdoch, and they kept on walking past the
house, without displaying any interest.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Dan," Steve Klaw said.</p>

<p>"She's supposed to keep her shade up&mdash;except when one of us
is up there."</p>

<p>"We better snap it up then!" Murdoch barked.</p>

<p>They turned into the garage next door, and Steve waved the
attendant away.</p>

<p>"I just want to get something out of my car," he said. They went
all the way to the rear of the garage, found the back exit, and
stepped out into the concrete yard. From there they made their way
into the yard of the apartment house, and went down to the
basement.</p>

<p>They took the back stairs up to the first floor, and Murdoch
tried the door while Stephen Klaw waited, pressing his body against
the corridor wall.</p>

<p>The door opened under Murdoch's touch, revealing the foyer. A
man with a sawed-off machine gun was standing in the foyer, with
the muzzle of the deadly weapon trained upon the doorway.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon!" the man said to Murdoch, leering over the
muzzle of the machine gun. "We thought that some of the girl's
friends would be coming to visit her. Put your hands up, and come
right in!"</p>

<p>Dan Murdoch stood stiffly in the doorway, without moving. Steve
Klaw was almost at his elbow, but was standing in such a way that
he was not visible to the man with the gun. Murdoch smiled
genially, but did not raise his hands. For the benefit of Klaw, he
described the situation as best he could.</p>

<p>"So you're a Skull and Swastika man, eh? Waiting to shoot me
down, eh? What did you do with Sue Watson?"</p>

<p>"She's been taken away, my friend," the gunman said. "She'll be
well taken care of. As for you, come right in. We want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>A second gunman appeared from the interior of the apartment, at
the first one's elbow.</p>

<p>"See what I have caught, Hans!" the first one said over his
shoulder to the second. "A nice big fish for our net!"</p>

<p>That was all he said. Stephen Klaw, at the first hint of
trouble, had dropped to his knees and drawn both his automatics. He
swung around on his knees, in front of the doorway, and peered up
at the two gunmen in the foyer from between Murdoch's legs.</p>

<p>"You guys talk too much!" he said disgustedly.</p>

<p>The gunmen, startled, glanced down, swinging the muzzles of
their machine guns down to bear upon Klaw.</p>

<p>And Klaw fired from the ground, once with each automatic. He
shot at an upward angle of about thirty degrees, but his aim was
just as good as in level shooting. His slugs got both killers
square in the throat, and sent them crashing back into the
apartment with their machine guns unfired.</p>

<p>The two explosions of his automatics sounded more like the
backfire of an automobile than like pistol shots.</p>

<p>"Nice work, Shrimp!" Murdoch said, and sprang forward into the
apartment, drawing both his revolvers. He leaped over the
still-thrashing bodies of the gun-men, into the living room. A
third man was in there methodically searching the place with all
the thoroughness of the Gestapo. The sofa had been ripped apart,
the disemboweled cushions lay on the floor. The drawers of the desk
had been pulled out and ransacked.</p>

<p>The man uttered a guttural curse and yanked out a pistol.
Murdoch coolly shot him through the heart. Then he turned and
looked at Stephen Klaw.</p>

<p>"Well, Shrimp," he said. "It looks like we didn't keep your
promise to Mary Watson!"</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw's face was white. He gripped those two automatics
tightly, as if he wished to beat someone's brains out with
them.</p>

<p>"We've got to find her, Dan," he whispered. "We've got to find
her&mdash;before they go to work on her!"</p>

<p>"Let's get out then," said Murdoch. "We'll never find her
here!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">5. THE LAIR OF TREBIZOND</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">STIFFLY, they walked out of the apartment, never
looking at the dead men they left behind. They walked down the
stairs and out into the street, like two automatons. They were both
thinking of Sue Watson in the hands of Franz Trebizond. And they
were remembering the things that had been done to Estelle Frazer,
and to others who had fallen into those hands.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Dan Murdoch said hopefully, "maybe they left other men
outside, to watch for us. Maybe they'll try to get us&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've got to take the next one alive," Steve murmured. "We've
got to make him tell us where to find Sue!"</p>

<p>He stopped as an automobile horn sounded across the street.</p>

<p>Both of them swiveled to face that sound, going for their guns.
But they didn't draw them.</p>

<p>Murdoch said, "Ah!" and Klaw exhaled a great gust of breath.</p>

<p>It was a taxicab horn which was being blown across the street.
The driver was using it to signal them, at the order of one of the
occupants.</p>

<p>The occupants were Johnny Kerrigan and Lisa Monterey.</p>

<p>Swiftly they crossed the street and climbed into the cab.</p>

<p>Lisa Monterey's wrists were handcuffed behind her. She was
sitting silent and sullen, next to Kerrigan, who was grinning. The
taxicab driver turned around and winked as Murdoch and Klaw got
in.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Kerrigan, nodding in the direction of the driver,
"I want you to meet Sam Meyers, who hates the Skull and Swastika
Corps as much as we do. I caught up with Miss Monterey here, and
gave her the choice of coming along with me, or of being turned in
to the police on a murder rap. P.S! she preferred to come with me.
Then I explained to Sam what it was all about, and he offered the
use of his cab. So here we are."</p>

<p>"That's right, gents," Sam Meyers said eagerly. "Anything I can
do to keep the Nazis outta this country&mdash;I'll do it. And I
ain't afraid o' no fast action, neither. I was a corp'ral in the
last war, an' seen plenty o' action&mdash;an' mud!"</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, Sam," said Dan Murdoch.</p>

<p>Steve Klaw turned to Kerrigan and said flatly, "Johnny, the
skunks have got Sue!"</p>

<p>Kerrigan scowled, and nodded. "I thought so, when we drove up
and saw the shade down."</p>

<p>Lisa Monterey smiled thinly. "You three men are fools. You can
never beat the Skull and Swastika. Franz Trebizond will get you, as
he has gotten all of the enemies of our Fuehrer."</p>

<p>Steve Klaw, sitting backward on one of the folding chairs next
to Murdoch, looked at her speculatively.</p>

<p>"You could tell us where they've got Sue Watson, couldn't
you?"</p>

<p>She threw him a glance of vicious spite. "I will tell you
nothing!"</p>

<p>Steve looked at Kerrigan. "When this dame phoned in to her
headquarters from the lobby of the Hotel Groton, Johnny, you
checked on the call?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Johnny. "I got the number, and traced the address
through the telephone company. But it was a blind lead, Steve. That
address is the home of Judge Hinchley. There must be some mistake.
Judge Hinchley was a Congressman before he was appointed Judge, and
he introduced a bill in Congress to force the deportation of every
alien member of the Skull and Swastika Corps."</p>

<p>"I see," Steve said thoughtfully. He had been watching Lisa
Monterey keenly as Johnny spoke, and he saw the sudden involuntary
jerk of her shoulders at the mention of Judge Hinchley. Her eyes
widened almost imperceptibly, and then were immediately veiled.</p>

<p>"Suppose we go see Judge Hinchley," he said. "Perhaps some
servant in the Judge's home is acting as intermediary for
Trebizond. The servant may be a clearing house for messages between
agents of the Skull and Swastika."</p>

<p>"Let's go!" said Johnny Kerrigan.</p>

<p>The Judge's home was a low, rambling Colonial, built on a large,
landscaped plot of ground in Riverdale, just within the city
limits. It was a good forty minute drive from where they started,
but Sam Meyer made it in twenty minutes flat.</p>

<p>They parked a hundred feet away, and left Lisa Monterey
handcuffed to the door-frame of the cab, in charge of Sam
Meyer.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw went up the flower-bordered walk to the front door,
while Kerrigan and Murdoch faded into the shrubbery surrounding the
house.</p>

<p>A burly manservant answered the bell, and scowled at Steve.</p>

<p>"May I see Judge Hinchley?" Steve asked mildly.</p>

<p>The manservant filled the doorway, towering above Klaw.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said gruffly. "Judge Hinchley has been ill with
a heart attack, for the past month. He can see no one."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'll want to see me," Steve said, "if you'll take my
name in to him. The name is&mdash;Black."</p>

<p>He watched the man's face, but caught no reaction. He went on
swiftly, stabbing in the dark. "It's all right, you can take me in
to the Chief. I was sent here by Lisa Monterey."</p>

<p>Now he saw the man's eyes flicker. But he recovered his stolid
pose at once. "I don't know that name. But step in. I'll tell Mr.
Belding, the Judge's secretary."</p>

<p>The man moved aside, and Steve stepped inside, sliding his hands
into his coat pockets.</p>

<p>The servant led him into a waiting room at the side of the
foyer, and left him there. Steve did not sit down. He stood with
his back to the window, and tapped gently upon the pane with his
fingernail. An answering tap sounded from outside. It was either
Johnny Kerrigan or Dan Murdoch.</p>

<p>Steve ran his fingertips along the window sash and found the
wire of a burglar alarm system. Swiftly he felt along the wire,
until he came to a spot where the wire had been spliced into the
main burglar alarm line. He twisted at the tape, ripped it off, and
separated the two wires. He tapped once again on the pane, and
stepped away from the window just as the door opened and a stocky,
bald-headed man entered the room.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Belding," said the bald-headed man. "Judge Hinchley's
secretary. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Steve's hands were back in his pockets. "I've got to see the
Judge," Steve said. "I have reason to believe that someone in this
house is connected with the Skull and Swastika Corps."</p>

<p>Belding almost jumped under the sudden impact of that bleak
statement.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed. "We are all loyal Americans in this
house!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Steve persisted, "there is at least one Skull
and Swastika member here. Maybe more. I insist on seeing the
Judge."</p>

<p>Belding looked at him queerly. "You said something to the butler
about having been sent here by a woman named Lisa Monterey?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell the Judge when I see him." Belding smiled thinly.
"I'm sure you will. Follow me."</p>

<p>He turned and opened the door by which he had entered, and led
the way through into the next room. Stephen Klaw entered, and
stopped short on the threshold. His eyes widened momentarily.</p>

<p>This room was a library. But it was immense. The ceiling had
been removed, making the room the height of the house, with a
balcony running around all four sides. There were bookshelves both
below and above the balcony. And hanging from the opposite was a
great purple banner with the ghastly insignia of the Skull and
Swastika. Standing up there on the balcony, in front of the banner,
were four men in the natty uniform of the S. S. Corps. Each of them
had a sawed-off machine gun, which was trained upon Klaw. Steve
gave them only one glance, then centered his attention upon the
long table at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>Sue Watson was seated at that table. Her wrists were handcuffed
to the chair. A few feet away, there was another chair, in which
was seated Judge Hinchley. Steve recognized him at once, but was
startled by the change in the man. The Judge's face was haggard and
pinched, and his eyes were deep-sunken wells of misery and shame.
He sat half slumped in the chair in an attitude which bespoke utter
hopelessness.</p>

<p>Behind the chair in which Sue Watson was handcuffed, stood Franz
Trebizond.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw had never seen the man, but he had gotten a good
description from Mary Watson. Even without the description,
however, he would have known that this was Trebizond.</p>

<p>The man was lean and gaunt, like the carcass of Death itself.
His lips were so thin and bloodless that his mouth seemed to be
nothing but a straight line drawn in crayon across his face. His
eyes were coal-black, and protruded so far that they seemed about
to leap out and strike at one. He was standing in such a way that
most of his cadaverous body was protected by the chair. He had one
of Sue's ears gripped between two of his bony, bloodless fingers.
In his other hand a handle to which was affixed a razor blade. He
was holding the blade idly in the air above Sue's head.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Klaw," he said. "Let us do away with all
pretense. I know that you are Stephen Klaw, one of those three
devils who are called the Suicide Squad. And you know that I am
Franz Trebizond. I am the one for whom you have been searching. You
have found me only because I wanted you to find me. I expected that
you would come here to investigate, when I learned that Lisa
Monterey had phoned this number from the Groton Hotel. You see, I
did not underestimate you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Stephen Klaw, bowing graciously. He still had
his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"You see," Trebizond went on smoothly, "I have been using the
home of my good friend, Judge Hinchley, who was once such a violent
enemy of the Skull and Swastika. I enjoy converting my enemies into
friends&mdash;and servants. The Fuehrer gave us an example when he
converted France into a servant of his purposes. Just so, I have
done with Judge Hinchley...and others."</p>

<p>Judge Hinchley stirred in his seat. "Damn you!" he grated in a
hoarse voice. "Damn you for the devil himself!"</p>

<p>Trebizond laughed. "You see, Mr. Klaw, how my friends love me?
Judge Hinchley will do whatever I ask of him, because his nineteen
year old son volunteered to fight in Loyalist Spain, and escaped in
France after the collapse of the Spanish Republican Army. The boy
was interned. But when the armies of our glorious Fuehrer conquered
France, young Hinchley became our prisoner. Now, the good judge
must serve us well, for we have his son as our hostage."</p>

<p>"I see," said Stephen Klaw. His eyes were on the razor blade
Trebizond held in one hand, and on the pink ear of Sue Watson which
he held with the other. "And now you expect to convert me into the
same kind of 'friend'."</p>

<p>"Exactly. First, let me warn you that at the least suspicious
move you make, my bodyguards on the balcony will let fire with four
guns, and turn your body into a sieve. For instance, if you should
attempt to draw those two automatics you are holding in your
pockets, my guards would shoot before you could draw."</p>

<p>A twisted smile tugged at Steve's lips. "I thank you for the
warning. Let's hear what you have to say."</p>

<p>"What I have to say is easily understood. This girl&mdash;Sue
Watson&mdash;is a very beautiful and delicate creature, whom it
would be a pity to disfigure. I understand you are interested in
her. I, too, am interested in her. Because I hated her mother, I
should like to dismember her, bit by bit. You see how easily I
could slice off her ear. There is so much I could do to
her&mdash;and enjoy it. Yet I am willing to forego this
pleasure&mdash;in exchange for a very small favor which you can do
for me."</p>

<p>Steve nodded. "I know what you want&mdash;the list of the
Executive Council of the Skull and Swastika."</p>

<p>"Exactly. You will give up the list. And you will give up your
persecution of the S. S. Corps. You will turn your talents to other
endeavors. So long as you do not molest us, Mr. Klaw, Sue Watson
will remain unharmed."</p>

<p>Sue's face was white and tense. "No, no, Steve!" she cried out.
"Don't give him the list. I don't care what he does to me!"</p>

<p>Trebizond yanked hard at her ear, so that she gasped and bit her
lip with pain.</p>

<p>"I want your answer now, Klaw. Or else you will see this girl
die slowly!"</p>

<p>"I haven't got the list with me," Steve said huskily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps one of your partners has it then? Kerrigan or Murdoch?
They came along with you, I'm sure. No doubt they are trying to get
into the house by a window or a back door. I must tell you that it
would be very regrettable if they broke in. My burglar alarm system
is not the ordinary kind. It doesn't ring a bell. Instead, it
releases a flood of deadly gas which kills the intruder as soon as
he puts his head inside the window&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a voice from the balcony, directly across
from where the four guards stood with the machine guns.</p>

<p>"My, my!" said the voice. "You certainly are very thorough, Mr.
Trebizond! It was a good thing that Steve Klaw unhooked the burglar
alarm for us!"</p>

<p>Steve threw a quick glance up at the balcony, and grinned.
Kerrigan and Murdoch had come out of a doorway up there. They must
have climbed in through the window in the waiting room, and made
their way up through the house. The guards had certainly seen them
come out on the balcony, but must have thought at first that they
were members of the household, not dreaming that anyone could enter
from the outside.</p>

<p>Kerrigan and Murdoch were standing shoulder to shoulder up
there, guns in hand, and facing those four machine guns at the
opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>"Shoot! Shoot!" screamed Trebizond.</p>

<p>But it was Kerrigan and Murdoch who started shooting first.
Their four heavy revolvers began to blast in a synchronized,
thrumming fandango of death. The slugs from their heavy revolvers
smashed at the machine-gunners before those killers could recover
sufficiently from their surprise to raise their sights from Stephen
Klaw on the floor below. The bodies of those gunmen were smashed
back against the wall.</p>

<p>And at the same time, Stephen Klaw began to fire his two
automatics from his pockets, through the cloth. His left hand gun
lanced three shots quickly at the bald-headed Belding, who had been
standing over to one side. With his right hand gun he fired up at
the balcony, to help Kerrigan and Murdoch. He dared not shoot at
Trebizond, who, ducking down behind Sue Watson's chair, had drawn a
gun.</p>

<p>Klaw leaped forward, across the vast floor toward the chair
where Sue sat handcuffed, and behind which Trebizond had taken
refuge. He had his automatics out now, but held his fire. He raced
forward, hoping to reach Trebizond before the spy-master could harm
Sue.</p>

<p>But Trebizond had forgotten about the girl. Snarling with rage,
he thrust out his revolver.</p>

<p>Steve saw the muzzle, but kept on coming in at a run. The gun
rose, the black hole of the muzzle staring him in the face. In
another fraction of a second Trebizond would fire, at almost point
blank range, into Klaw's face...And then, a hurtling body threw
itself headlong into the line of fire just as Trebizond's gun
exploded!</p>

<p>It was Judge Hinchley!</p>

<p>The Judge had leaped out of his chair with a hoarse cry, and
virtually flung himself upon the bullet earmarked for Steve!</p>

<p>Hinchley fell, the blood gushing from a wound in his chest. And
in that instant Stephen Klaw leaped over the desk and sprang around
behind the chair. Trebizond uttered a squeal of fright, and raised
his revolver.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw's gray eyes flickered for a moment, and his lips
were tight and grim. He thrust his automatic out at arm's length
into Trebizond's face, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The blasting of gunfire was echoing and re-echoing from every
nook and cranny of the great old house. Kerrigan and Murdoch leaped
down from the balcony to join Steve Klaw on the main floor. Klaw
went swiftly through the pockets of the dead Trebizond and found
the keys to the handcuffs which bound Sue's wrists to the chair. He
freed her, and raised her to her feet.</p>

<p>The Judge was dying fast. But that look of utter hopelessness
which Klaw had seen in his eyes before was no longer there. And his
lips were smiling. Klaw bent low over him, thinking as he did so of
that moment last night when he had bent low over a dying woman. She
had given up her life, too.</p>

<p>"I've...paid my...debt. Not ashamed...any more! My
son&mdash;they'll kill him now..."</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw clasped the old man's hand tightly. "I'm sure your
son would rather have it this way, Judge."</p>

<p>"Yes...yes. Thank God I had...the courage..." A gush of blood
filled the old man's throat, and he died.</p>

<p>Stephen Klaw got to his feet, and put an arm around the
shoulders of Sue Watson, who was sobbing quietly. He looked over at
the grim, bleak faces of Kerrigan and Murdoch. The three of them
were thinking of the same thing&mdash;of the hard days ahead, when
they would have to round up all the hundreds of members of the
Skull and Swastika&mdash;many of them honest Americans like Judge
Hinchley, who had come against their will, under the thumb of the
merciless organization. They were thinking of the heartbreak and
the sorrow that would come to many American homes where a son or a
daughter or a father had been led into disloyalty by the vile
tenets of the S.S. Corps. But they were also thinking that the
heartbreak and the sorrow would be a small price to pay to keep
America free!</p>
