<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.</h2>

<p>The young lieutenant lay beside the war correspondent and admired
the idyllic calm of the enemy's lines through his field-glass.</p>

<p>"So far as I can see," he said, at last, "one man."</p>

<p>"What's he doing?" asked the war correspondent.</p>

<p>"Field-glass at us," said the young lieutenant</p>

<p>"And this is war!"</p>

<p>"No," said the young lieutenant; "it's Bloch."</p>

<p>"The game's a draw."</p>

<p>"No! They've got to win or else they lose. A draw's a win for our
side."</p>

<p>They had discussed the political situation fifty times or so, and
the war correspondent was weary of it. He stretched out his limbs.
"Aaai s'pose it <i>is</i>!" he yawned.</p>

<p>"<i>Flut!</i>"</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Shot at us."</p>

<p>The war correspondent shifted to a slightly lower position. "No one
shot at him," he complained.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they think we shall get so bored we shall go home?"</p>

<p>The war correspondent made no reply.</p>

<p>"There's the harvest, of course...."</p>

<p>They had been there a month. Since the first brisk movements after
the declaration of war things had gone slower and slower, until it
seemed as though the whole machine of events must have run down. To
begin with, they had had almost a scampering time; the invader had come
across the frontier on the very dawn of the war in half-a-dozen
parallel columns behind a cloud of cyclists and cavalry, with a general
air of coming straight on the capital, and the defender horsemen had
held him up, and peppered him and forced him to open out to outflank,
and had then bolted to the next position in the most approved style,
for a couple of days, until in the afternoon, bump! they had the
invader against their prepared lines of defense. He did not suffer so
much as had been hoped and expected: he was coming on, it seemed with
his eyes open, his scouts winded the guns, and down he sat at once
without the shadow of an attack and began grubbing trenches for
himself, as though he meant to sit down there to the very end of time.
He was slow, but much more wary than the world had been led to expect,
and he kept convoys tucked in and shielded his slow marching infantry
sufficiently well to prevent any heavy adverse scoring.</p>

<p>"But he ought to attack," the young lieutenant had insisted.</p>

<p>"He'll attack us at dawn, somewhere along the lines. You'll get the
bayonets coming into the trenches just about when you can see," the war
correspondent had held until a week ago.</p>

<p>The young lieutenant winked when he said that.</p>

<p>When one early morning the men the defenders sent to lie out five
hundred yards before the trenches, with a view to the unexpected
emptying of magazines into any night attack, gave way to causeless
panic and blazed away at nothing for ten minutes, the war correspondent
understood the meaning of that wink.</p>

<p>"What would you do if you were the enemy?" said the war
correspondent, suddenly.</p>

<p>"If I had men like I've got now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Take those trenches."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;dodges! Crawl out half-way at night before moonrise and
get into touch with the chaps we send out. Blaze at 'em if they tried
to shift, and so bag some of 'em in the daylight. Learn that patch of
ground by heart, lie all day in squatty holes, and come on nearer next
night. There's a bit over there, lumpy ground, where they could get
across to rushing distance&mdash;easy. In a night or so. It would be a
mere game for our fellows; it's what they're made for.... Guns?
Shrapnel and stuff wouldn't stop good men who meant business."</p>

<p>"Why don't <i>they</i> do that?"</p>

<p>"Their men aren't brutes enough: that's the trouble. They're a crowd
of devitalized townsmen, and that's the truth of the matter' They're
clerks, they're factory hands, they're students, they're civilized men.
They can write, they can talk, they can make and do all sorts of
things, but they're poor amateurs at war. They've got no physical
staying power, and that's the whole thing. They've never slept in the
open one night in their lives; they've never drunk anything but the
purest water-company water; they've never gone short of three meals a
day since they left their feeding-bottles. Half their cavalry never
cocked leg over horse till it enlisted six months ago. They ride their
horses as though they were bicycles&mdash;you watch 'em! They're fools
at the game, and they know it. Our boys of fourteen can give their
grown men points.... Very well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The war correspondent mused on his face with his nose between his
knuckles.</p>

<p>"If a decent civilization," he said, "cannot produce better men for
war than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped with belated politeness.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Than our open-air life," said the young lieutenant, politely.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the war correspondent. "Then civilization has to
stop."</p>

<p>"It looks like it," the young lieutenant admitted.</p>

<p>"Civilization has science, you know," said the war correspondent.
"It invented and it makes the rifles and guns and things you use."</p>

<p>"Which our nice healthy hunters and stockmen and so on, rowdy-dowdy
cowpunchers and negro-whackers, can use ten times better
than&mdash;&mdash;<i>What's that?</i>"</p>

<p>"What?" said the war correspondent, and then seeing his companion
busy with his field-glass he produced his own: "Where?" said the war
correspondent, sweeping the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>"It's nothing" said the young lieutenant, still looking.</p>

<p>"What's nothing?"</p>

<p>The young lieutenant put down his glass and pointed. "I thought I
saw something there, behind the stems of those trees. Something black.
What it was I don't know."</p>

<p>The war correspondent tried to get even by intense scrutiny.</p>

<p>"It wasn't anything" said the young lieutenant, rolling over to
regard the darkling evening sky, and generalized: "There never will be
anything any more for ever. Unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The war correspondent looked inquiry.</p>

<p>"They may get their stomachs wrong, or something&mdash;-living
without proper drains."</p>

<p>A sound of bugles came from the tents behind. The war correspondent
slid backward down the sand and stood up. "Boom!" came from somewhere
far away to the left. "Halloa!" he said, hesitated, and crawled back to
peer again. "Firing at this time is jolly bad manners."</p>

<p>The young lieutenant was incommunicative again for a space.</p>

<p>Then he pointed to the distant clump of trees again. "One of our big
guns. They were firing at that." he said.</p>

<p>"The thing that wasn't anything?"</p>

<p>"Something over there, anyhow."</p>

<p>Both men were silent, peering through their glasses for a space.
"Just when it's twilight," the lieutenant complained. He stood up.</p>

<p>"I might stay here a bit," said the war correspondent.</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head. "There is nothing to see," he
apologized, and then went down to where his little squad of sun-brown,
loose-limbed men had been yarning in the trench. The war correspondent
stood up also, glanced for a moment at the business-like bustle below
him, gave perhaps twenty seconds to those enigmatical trees again, then
turned his face toward the camp.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering whether his editor would consider the
story of how somebody thought he saw something black behind a clump of
trees, and how a gun was fired at this illusion by somebody else, too
trivial for public consultation.</p>

<p>"It's the only gleam of a shadow of interest," said the war
correspondent, "for ten whole days."</p>

<p>"No," he said, presently; "I'll write that other article, 'Is War
Played Out?'"</p>

<p>He surveyed the darkling lines in perspective, the tangle of
trenches one behind another, one commanding another, which the defender
had made ready. The shadows and mists swallowed up their receding
contours, and here and there a lantern gleamed, and here and there
knots of men were busy about small fires.</p>

<p>"No troops on earth could do it," he said....</p>

<p>He was depressed. He believed that there were other things in life
better worth having than proficiency in war; he believed that in the
heart of civilization, for all its stresses, its crushing
concentrations of forces, its injustice and suffering, there lay
something that might be the hope of the world, and the idea that any
people by living in the open air, hunting perpetually, losing touch
with books and art and all the things that intensify life, might hope
to resist and break that great development to the end of time, jarred
on his civilized soul.</p>

<p>Apt to his thought came a file of defender soldiers and passed him
in the gleam of a swinging lamp that marked the way.</p>

<p>He glanced at their red-lit faces, and one shone out for a moment, a
common type of face in the defender's ranks: ill-shaped nose, sensuous
lips, bright clear eyes full of alert cunning, slouch hat cocked on one
side and adorned with the peacock's plume of the rustic Don Juan turned
soldier, a hard brown skin, a sinewy frame, an open, tireless stride,
and a master's grip on the rifle.</p>

<p>The war correspondent returned their salutations and went on his
way.</p>

<p>"Louts," he whispered. "Cunning, elementary louts. And they are
going to beat the townsmen at the game of war!"</p>

<p>From the red glow among the nearer tents came first one and then
half-a-dozen hearty voices, bawling in a drawling unison the words of a
particularly slab and sentimental patriotic song.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>go</i> it!" muttered the war correspondent, bitterly.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2>

<p>It was opposite the trenches called after Hackbone's Hut that the
battle began. There the ground stretched broad and level between the
lines, with scarcely shelter for a lizard, and it seemed to the
startled, just awakened men who came crowding into the trenches that
this was one more proof of that green inexperience of the enemy of
which they had heard so much. The war correspondent would not believe
his ears at first, and swore that he and the war artist, who, still
imperfectly roused, was trying to put on his boots by the light of a
match held in his hand, were the victims of a common illusion. Then,
after putting his head in a bucket of cold water, his intelligence came
back as he towelled. He listened. "Gollys!" he said; "that's something
more than scare firing this time. It's like ten thousand carts on a
bridge of tin."</p>

<p>There came a sort of enrichment to that steady uproar.
"Machine-guns!"</p>

<p>Then, "Guns!"</p>

<p>The artist, with one boot on, thought to look at his watch, and went
to it hopping.</p>

<p>"Half an hour from dawn," he said. "You were right about their
attacking, after all...."</p>

<p>The war correspondent came out of the tent, verifying the presence
of chocolate in his pocket as he did so. He had to halt for a moment or
so until his eyes were toned down to the night a little. "Pitch!" he
said. He stood for a space to season his eyes before he felt justified
in striking out for a black gap among the adjacent tents. The artist
coming out behind him fell over a tent-rope. It was half-past two
o'clock in the morning of the darkest night in time, and against a sky
of dull black silk the enemy was talking searchlights, a wild jabber of
searchlights. "He's trying to blind our riflemen," said the war
correspondent with a flash, and waited for the artist and then set off
with a sort of discreet haste again. "Whoa!" he said, presently.
"Ditches!"</p>

<p>They stopped.</p>

<p>"It's the confounded searchlights," said the war correspondent.</p>

<p>They saw lanterns going to and fro, near by, and men falling in to
march down to the trenches. They were for following them, and then the
artist began to feel his night eyes. "If we scramble this," he said,
"and it's only a drain, there's a clear run up to the ridge." And that
way they took. Lights came and went in the tents behind, as the men
turned out, and ever and again they came to broken ground and staggered
and stumbled. But in a little while they drew near the crest. Something
that sounded like the impact of a very important railway accident
happened in the air above them, and the shrapnel bullets seethed about
them like a sudden handful of hail. "Right-ho!" said the war
correspondent, and soon they judged they had come to the crest and
stood in the midst of a world of great darkness and frantic glares,
whose principal fact was sound.</p>

<p>Right and left of them and all about them was the uproar, an
army-full of magazine fire, at first chaotic and monstrous and then,
eked out by little flashes and gleams and suggestions, taking the
beginnings of a shape. It looked to the war correspondent as though the
enemy must have attacked in line and with his whole force&mdash;in
which case he was either being or was already annihilated.</p>

<p>"Dawn and the dead," he said, with his instinct for headlines. He
said this to himself, but afterwards, by means of shouting, he conveyed
an idea to the artist.</p>

<p>"They must have meant it for a surprise," he said.</p>

<p>It was remarkable how the firing kept on. After a time he began to
perceive a sort of rhythm in this inferno of noise. It would
decline&mdash;decline perceptibly, droop towards something that was
comparatively a pause&mdash;a pause of inquiry. "Aren't you all dead
yet?" this pause seemed to say. The flickering fringe of rifle-flashes
would become attenuated and broken, and the whack-bang of the enemy's
big guns two miles away there would come up out of the deeps. Then
suddenly, east or west of them, something would startle the rifles to a
frantic outbreak again.</p>

<p>The war correspondent taxed his brain for some theory of conflict
that would account for this, and was suddenly aware that the artist and
he were vividly Illuminated. He could see the ridge on which they stood
and before them in black outline a file of riflemen hurrying down
towards the nearer trenches. It became visible that a light rain was
falling, and farther away towards the enemy was a clear space with
men&mdash;"our men?"&mdash;running across it in disorder. He saw one of
those men throw up his hands and drop. And something else black and
shining loomed up on the edge of the beam-coruscating flashes; and
behind it and far away a calm, white eye regarded the world. "Whit,
whit, whit," sang something in the air, and then the artist was running
for cover, with the war correspondent behind him. Bang came shrapnel,
bursting close at hand as it seemed, and our two men were lying flat in
a dip in the ground, and the light and everything had gone again,
leaving a vast note of interrogation upon the night.</p>

<p>The war correspondent came within bawling range. "What the deuce was
it? Shooting our men down!"</p>

<p>"Black," said the artist, "and like a fort. Not two hundred yards
from the first trench."</p>

<p>He sought for comparisons in his mind. "Something between a big
blockhouse and a giant's dish-cover," he said.</p>

<p>"And they were running!" said the war correspondent.</p>

<p>"<i>You'd</i> run if a thing like that, searchlight to help it,
turned up like a prowling nightmare in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>They crawled to what they judged the edge of the dip and lay
regarding the unfathomable dark. For a space they could distinguish
nothing, and then a sudden convergence of the searchlights of both
sides brought the strange thing out again.</p>

<p>In that flickering pallor it had the effect of a large and clumsy
black insect, an insect the size of an ironclad cruiser, crawling
obliquely to the first line of trenches and firing shots out of
portholes in its side. And on its carcass the bullets must have been
battering with more than the passionate violence of hail on a roof of
tin.</p>

<p>Then in the twinkling of an eye the curtain of the dark had fallen
again and the monster had vanished, but the crescendo of musketry
marked its approach to the trenches.</p>

<p>They were beginning to talk about the thing to each other, when a
flying bullet kicked dirt into the artist's face, and they, decided
abruptly to crawl down into the cover of the trenches. They had got
down with an unobtrusive persistence into the second line, before the
dawn had grown clear enough for anything to be seen. They found
themselves in a crowd of expectant riflemen, all noisily arguing about
what would happen next. The enemy's contrivance had done execution upon
the outlying men, it seemed, but they did not believe it would do any
more. "Come the day and we'll capture the lot of them," said a burly
soldier.</p>

<p>"Them?" said the war correspondent.</p>

<p>"They say there's a regular string of 'em, crawling along the front
of our lines.... Who cares?"</p>

<p>The darkness filtered away so imperceptibly that at no moment could
one declare decisively that one could see. The searchlights ceased to
sweep hither and thither. The enemy's monsters were dubious patches of
darkness upon the dark, and then no longer dubious, and so they crept
out into distinctness. The war correspondent, munching chocolate
absent-mindedly, beheld at last a spacious picture of battle under the
cheerless sky, whose central focus was an array of fourteen or fifteen
huge clumsy shapes lying in perspective on the very edge of the first
line of trenches, at intervals of perhaps three hundred yards, and
evidently firing down upon the crowded riflemen. They were so close in
that the defender's guns had ceased, and only the first line of
trenches was in action.</p>

<p>The second line commanded the first, and as the light grew the war
correspondent could make out the riflemen who were fighting these
monsters, crouched in knots and crowds behind the transverse banks that
crossed the trenches against the eventuality of an enfilade. The
trenches close to the big machines were empty save for the crumpled
suggestions of dead and wounded men; the defenders had been driven
right and left as soon as the prow of this land ironclad had loomed up
over the front of the trench. He produced his field-glass, and was
immediately a centre of inquiry from the soldiers about him.</p>

<p>They wanted to look, they asked questions, and after he had
announced that the men across the traverses seemed unable to advance or
retreat, and were crouching under cover rather than fighting, he found
it advisable to loan his glasses to a burly and incredulous corporal.
He heard a strident voice, and found a lean and sallow soldier at his
back talking to the artist.</p>

<p>"There's chaps down there caught," the man was saying. "If they
retreat they got to expose themselves, and the fire's too
straight...."</p>

<p>"They aren't firing much, but every shot's a hit."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The chaps in that thing. The men who're coming
up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coming up where?"</p>

<p>"We're evacuating them trenches where we can. Our chaps are coming
back up the zigzags.... No end of 'em hit.... But when we get clear our
turn'll come. Rather! These things won't be able to cross a trench or
get into it; and before they can get back our guns'll smash 'em up.
Smash 'em right up. See?" A brightness came into his eyes. "Then we'll
have a go at the beggar inside," he said....</p>

<p>The war correspondent thought for a moment, trying to realize the
idea. Then he set himself to recover his field-glasses from the burly
corporal....</p>

<p>The daylight was getting clearer now. The clouds were lifting, and a
gleam of lemon-yellow amidst the level masses to the east portended
sunrise. He looked again at the land ironclad. As he saw it in the
bleak grey dawn, lying obliquely upon the slope and on the very lip of
the foremost trench, the suggestion of a stranded vessel was very great
indeed. It might have been from eighty to a hundred feet long&mdash;it
was about two hundred and fifty yards away&mdash;its vertical side was
ten feet high or so, smooth for that height, and then with a complex
patterning under the eaves of its flattish turtle cover. This
patterning was a close interlacing of portholes, rifle barrels, and
telescope tubes&mdash;-sham and real&mdash;-indistinguishable one from
the other. The thing had come into such a position as to enfilade the
trench, which was empty now, so far as he could see, except for two or
three crouching knots of men and the tumbled dead. Behind it, across
the plain, it had scored the grass with a train of linked impressions,
like the dotted tracings sea-things leave in sand. Left and right of
that track dead men and wounded men were scattered&mdash;men it had
picked off as they fled back from their advanced positions in the
searchlight glare from the invader's lines. And now it lay with its
head projecting a little over the trench it had won, as if it were a
single sentient thing planning the next phase of its attack....</p>

<p>He lowered his glasses and took a more comprehensive view of the
situation. These creatures of the night had evidently won the first
line of trenches and the fight had come to a pause. In the increasing
light he could make out by a stray shot or a chance exposure that the
defender's marksmen were lying thick in the second and third line of
trenches up towards the low crest of the position, and in such of the
zigzags as gave them a chance of a converging fire. The men about him
were talking of guns. "We're in the line of the big guns at the crest
but they'll soon shift one to pepper them," the lean man said,
reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Whup," said the corporal:</p>

<p>"Bang! bang! bang! Whir-r-r-r-r!" It was a sort of nervous jump, and
all the rifles were going off by themselves. The war correspondent
found himself and the artist, two idle men crouching behind a line of
preoccupied backs, of industrious men discharging magazines. The
monster had moved. It continued to move regardless of the hail that
splashed its skin with bright new specks of lead. It was singing a
mechanical little ditty to itself, "Tuf-tuf, tuf-tuf, tuf-tuf," and
squirting out little jets of steam behind. It had humped itself up, as
a limpet does before it crawls; it had lifted its skirt and displayed
along the length of it&mdash;<i>feet</i>! They were thick, stumpy feet,
between knobs and buttons in shape&mdash;flat, broad things, reminding
one of the feet of elephants or the legs of caterpillars; and then, as
the skirt rose higher, the war correspondent, scrutinizing the thing
through his glasses again, saw that these feet hung, as it were, on the
rims of wheels. His thoughts whirled back to Victoria Street,
Westminster, and he saw himself in the piping times of peace, seeking
matter for an interview.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;Mr. Diplock," he said; "and he called them
Pedrails...Fancy meeting them here!"</p>

<p>The marksman beside him raised his head and shoulders in a
speculative mood to fire more certainly&mdash;It seemed so natural to
assume the attention of the monster must be distracted by this trench
before it&mdash;and was suddenly knocked backwards by a bullet through
his neck. His feet flew up, and he vanished out of the margin of the
watcher's field of vision. The war correspondent grovelled tighter, but
after a glance behind him at a painful little confusion, he resumed his
field-glass, for the thing was putting down its feet one after the
other, and hoisting itself farther and farther over the trench. Only a
bullet in the head could have stopped him looking just then.</p>

<p>The lean man with the strident voice ceased firing to turn and
reiterate his point. "They can't possibly cross," he bawled.
They&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"&mdash;drowned everything.</p>

<p>The lean man continued speaking for a word or so, then gave it up,
shook his head to enforce the impossibility of anything crossing a
trench like the one below, and resumed business once more.</p>

<p>And all the while that great bulk was crossing. When the war
correspondent turned his glass on it again it had bridged the trench,
and its queer feet were rasping away at the farther bank, in the
attempt to get a hold there. It got its hold. It continued to crawl
until the greater bulk of it was over the trench&mdash;until it was all
over. Then it paused for a moment, adjusted its skirt a little nearer
the ground, gave an unnerving "toot, toot," and came on abruptly at a
pace of, perhaps, six miles an hour straight up the gentle slope
towards our observer.</p>

<p>The war correspondent raised himself on his elbow and looked a
natural inquiry at the artist.</p>

<p>For a moment the men about him stuck to their position and fired
furiously. Then the lean man in a mood of precipitancy slid backwards,
and the war correspondent said "Come along" to the artist, and led the
movement along the trench.</p>

<p>As they dropped down, the vision of a hillside of trench being
rushed by a dozen vast cockroaches disappeared for a space, and instead
was one of a narrow passage, crowded with men, for the most part
receding, though one or two turned or halted. He never turned back to
see the nose of the monster creep over the brow of the trench; he never
even troubled to keep in touch with the artist. He heard the "whit" of
bullets about him soon enough, and saw a man before him stumble and
drop, and then he was one of a furious crowd fighting to get into a
transverse zigzag ditch that enabled the defenders to get under cover
up and down the hill. It was like a theatre panic. He gathered from
signs and fragmentary words that on ahead another of these monsters had
also won to the second trench.</p>

<p>He lost his interest in the general course of the battle for a space
altogether; he became simply a modest egotist, in a mood of hasty
circumspection, seeking the farthest rear, amidst a dispersed multitude
of disconcerted riflemen similarly employed. He scrambled down through
trenches, he took his courage in both hands and sprinted across the
open, he had moments of panic when it seemed madness not to be
quadrupedal, and moments of shame when he stood up and faced about to
see how the fight was going. And he was one of many thousand very
similar men that morning. On the ridge he halted in a knot of scrub,
and was for a few minutes almost minded to stop and see things out.</p>

<p>The day was now fully come. The grey sky had changed to blue, and of
all the cloudy masses of the dawn there remained only a few patches of
dissolving fleeciness. The world below was bright and singularly clear.
The ridge was not, perhaps, more than a hundred feet or so above the
general plain, but in this flat region it sufficed to give the effect
of extensive view. Away on the north side of the ridge, little and far,
were the camps, the ordered wagons, all the gear of a big army; with
officers galloping about and men doing aimless things. Here and there
men were falling in, however and the cavalry was forming up on the
plain beyond the tents. The bulk of men who had been in the trenches
were still on the move to the rear, scattered like sheep without a
shepherd over the farther slopes. Here and there were little rallies
and attempts to wait and do&mdash;something vague; but the general
drift was away from any concentration. There on the southern side was
the elaborate lacework of trenches and defences, across which these
iron turtles, fourteen of them spread out over a line of perhaps three
miles, were now advancing as fast as a man could trot, and methodically
shooting down and breaking up any persistent knots of resistance. Here
and there stood little clumps of men, outflanked and unable to get
away, showing the white flag, and the invader's cyclist-infantry was
advancing now across the open, in open order but unmolested, to
complete the work of the machines. Surveyed at large, the defenders
already looked a beaten army. A mechanism that was effectually ironclad
against bullets, that could at a pinch cross a thirty-foot trench, and
that seemed able to shoot out rifle-bullets with unerring precision,
was clearly an inevitable victor against anything but rivers,
precipices, and guns.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "Half-past four! Lord! What things can
happen in two hours. Here's the whole blessed army being walked over,
and at half-past two&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And even now our blessed louts haven't done a thing with their
guns!"</p>

<p>He scanned the ridge right and left of him with his glasses. He
turned again to the nearest land ironclad, advancing now obliquely to
him and not three hundred yards away, and then scrambled the ground
over which he must retreat if he was not to be captured.</p>

<p>"They'll do nothing," he said, and glanced again at the enemy.</p>

<p>And then from far away to the left came the thud of a gun, followed
very rapidly by a rolling gunfire.</p>

<p>He hesitated and decided to stay.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.</h2>

<p>The defender had relied chiefly upon his rifles in the event of an
assault. His guns he kept concealed at various points upon and behind
the ridge ready to bring them into action against any artillery
preparations for an attack on the part of his antagonist. The situation
had rushed upon him with the dawn, and by the time the gunners had
their guns ready for motion, the land ironclads were already in among
the foremost trenches. There is a natural reluctance to fire into one's
own broken men, and many of the guns, being Intended simply to fight an
advance of the enemy's artillery, were not in positions to hit anything
in the second line of trenches. After that the advance of the land
ironclads was swift. The defender-general found himself suddenly called
upon to invent a new sort of warfare, in which guns were to fight alone
amidst broken and retreating infantry. He had scarcely thirty minutes
in which to think it out. He did not respond to the call, and what
happened that morning was that the advance of the land ironclads forced
the fight, and each gun and battery made what play its circumstances
dictated. For the most part it was poor play.</p>

<p>Some of the guns got in two or three shots, some one or two, and the
percentage of misses was unusually high. The howitzers, of course, did
nothing. The land ironclads in each case followed much the same
tactics. As soon as a gun came into play the monster turned itself
almost end on, so as to minimize the chances of a square hit, and made
not for the gun, but for the nearest point on its flank from which the
gunners could be shot down. Few of the hits scored were very effectual;
only one of the things was disabled, and that was the one that fought
the three batteries attached to the brigade on the left wing. Three
that were hit when close upon the guns were clean shot through without
being put out of action. Our war correspondent did not see that one
momentary arrest of the tide of victory on the left; he saw only the
very ineffectual fight of half-battery 96B close at hand upon his
right. This he watched some time beyond the margin of safety.</p>

<p>Just after he heard the three batteries opening up upon his left he
became aware of the thud of horses' hoofs from the sheltered side of
the slope, and presently saw first one and then two other guns
galloping into position along the north side of the ridge, well out of
sight of the great bulk that was now creeping obliquely towards the
crest and cutting up the lingering infantry beside it and below, as it
came.</p>

<p>The half-battery swung round into line&mdash;each gun describing its
curve&mdash;halted, unlimbered, and prepared for action....</p>

<p>"Bang!"</p>

<p>The land ironclad had become visible over the brow of the hill, and
just visible as a long black back to the gunners. It halted, as though
it hesitated.</p>

<p>The two remaining guns fired, and then their big antagonist had
swung round and was in full view, end on, against the sky, coming at a
rush.</p>

<p>The gunners became frantic in their haste to fire again. They were
so near the war correspondent could see the expressions on their
excited faces through his field-glass. As he looked he saw a man drop,
and realized for the first time that the ironclad was shooting.</p>

<p>For a moment the big black monster crawled with an accelerated pace
towards the furiously active gunners. Then, as if moved by a generous
impulse, it turned its full broadside to their attack, and scarcely
forty yards away from them. The war correspondent turned his
field-glass back to the gunners and perceived it was now shooting down
the men about the guns with the most deadly rapidity.</p>

<p>Just for a moment it seemed splendid and then it seemed horrible.
The gunners were dropping in heaps about their guns. To lay a hand on a
gun was death. "Bang!" went the gun on the left, a hopeless miss, and
that was the only second shot the half-battery fired. In another moment
half-a-dozen surviving artillerymen were holding up their hands amidst
a scattered muddle of dead and wounded men, and the fight was done.</p>

<p>The war correspondent hesitated between stopping in his scrub and
waiting for an opportunity to surrender decently, or taking to an
adjacent gully he had discovered. If he surrendered it was certain he
would get no copy off; while, if he escaped, there were all sorts of
chances. He decided to follow the gully, and take the first offer in
the confusion beyond the camp of picking up a horse.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>

<p>Subsequent authorities have found fault with the first land
ironclads in many particulars, but assuredly they served their purpose
on the day of their appearance. They were essentially long, narrow, and
very strong steel frameworks carrying the engines, and borne upon eight
pairs of big pedrail wheels, each about ten feet in diameter, each a
driving wheel and set upon long axles free to swivel round a common
axis. This arrangement gave them the maximum of adaptability to the
contours of the ground. They crawled level along the ground with one
foot high upon a hillock and another deep in a depression, and they
could hold themselves erect and steady sideways upon even a steep
hillside. The engineers directed the engines under the command of the
captain, who had look-out points at small ports all round the upper
edge of the adjustable skirt of twelve-inch iron-plating which
protected the whole affair, and could also raise or depress a
conning-tower set about the portholes through the center of the iron
top cover. The riflemen each occupied a small cabin of peculiar
construction and these cabins were slung along the sides of and before
and behind the great main framework, in a manner suggestive of the
slinging of the seats of an Irish jaunting-car. Their rifles, however,
were very different pieces of apparatus from the simple mechanisms in
the hands of their adversaries.</p>

<p>These were in the first place automatic, ejected their cartridges
and loaded again from a magazine each time they fired, until the
ammunition store was at an end, and they had the most remarkable sights
imaginable, sights which threw a bright little camera-obscura picture
into the light-tight box in which the rifleman sat below. This
camera-obscura picture was marked with two crossed lines, and whatever
was covered by the intersection of these two lines, that the rifle hit.
The sighting was ingeniously contrived. The rifleman stood at the table
with a thing like an elaborately of a draughtsman's dividers in his
hand, and he opened and closed these dividers, so that they were always
at the apparent height&mdash;if it was an ordinary-sized man&mdash;of
the man he wanted to kill. A little twisted strand of wire like an
electric-light wire ran from this implement up to the gun, and as the
dividers opened and shut the sights went up and down. Changes in the
clearness of the atmosphere, due to changes of moisture, were met by an
ingenious use of that meteorologically sensitive substance, catgut, and
when the land ironclad moved forward the sites got a compensatory
deflection in the direction of its motion. The riflemen stood up in his
pitch-dark chamber and watched the little picture before him. One hand
held the dividers for judging distance, and the other grasped a big
knob like a door-handle. As he pushed this knob about the rifle above
swung to correspond, and the picture passed to and fro like an agitated
panorama. When he saw a man he wanted to shoot he brought him up to the
cross-lines, and then pressed a finger upon a little push like an
electric bell-push, conveniently placed in the center of the knob. Then
the man was shot. If by any chance the rifleman missed his target he
moved the knob a trifle, or readjusted his dividers, pressed the push,
and got him the second time.</p>

<p>This rifle and its sights protruded from a porthole, exactly like a
great number of other portholes that ran in a triple row under the
eaves of the cover of the land ironclad. Each porthole displayed a
rifle and sight in dummy, so that the real ones could only be hit by a
chance shot, and if one was, then the young man below said "Pshaw!"
turned on an electric light, lowered the injured instrument into his
camera, replaced the injured part, or put up a new rifle if the injury
was considerable.</p>

<p>You must conceive these cabins as hung clear above the swing of the
axles, and inside the big wheels upon which the great elephant-like
feet were hung, and behind these cabins along the center of the monster
ran a central gallery into which they opened, and along which worked
the big compact engines. It was like a long passage into which this
throbbing machinery had been packed, and the captain stood about the
middle, close to the ladder that led to his conning-tower, and directed
the silent, alert engineers&mdash;for the most part by signs. The throb
and noise of the engines mingled with the reports of the rifles and the
intermittent clangour of the bullet hail upon the armour. Ever and
again he would touch the wheel that raised his conning tower, step up
his ladder until his engineers could see nothing of him above the
waist, and then come down again with orders. Two small electric lights
were all the illumination of this space&mdash;they were placed to make
him most clearly visible to his subordinates; the air was thick with
the smell of oil and petrol, and had the war correspondent been
suddenly transferred from the spacious dawn outside to the bowels of
the apparatus he would have thought himself fallen into another
world.</p>

<p>The captain, of course, saw both sides of the battle. When he raised
his head into his conning-tower there were the dewy sunrise, the amazed
and disordered trenches, the flying and falling soldiers, the
depressed-looking groups of prisoners, the beaten guns; when he bent
down again to signal "half speed", "quarter speed", "half circle round
towards the right," or what not, he was in the oil-smelling twilight of
the ill-lit engine room. Close beside him on either side was the
mouthpiece of a speaking-tube, and ever and again he would direct one
side or other of his strange craft to "Concentrate fire forward on
gunners," or to "clear out trench about a hundred yards on our right
front."</p>

<p>He was a young man, healthy enough but by no means sun-tanned, and
of a type of feature and expression that prevails in His Majesty's
Navy: alert, intelligent, quiet. He and his engineers and his riflemen
all went about their work, calm and reasonable men. They had none of
that flapping strenuousness of the half-wit in a hurry, that excessive
strain upon the blood-vessels, that hysteria of effort which is so
frequently regarded as the proper state of mind for heroic deeds.</p>

<p>For the enemy these young engineers were defeating they felt a
certain qualified pity and a quite unqualified contempt. They regarded
these big, healthy men they were shooting down precisely as these same
big, healthy men might regard some inferior kind of native. They
despised them for making war; despised their bawling patriotisms and
their emotionality profoundly; despised them, above all, for the petty
cunning and the almost brutish want of imagination their method of
fighting displayed. "If they <i>must</i> make war," these young men
thought, "why in thunder don't they do it like sensible men?" They
resented the assumption that their own side was too stupid to do
anything more than play their enemy's game, that they were going to
play this costly folly according to the rules of unimaginative men.
They resented being forced to the trouble of making man-killing
machinery; resented the alternative of having to massacre these people
or endure their truculent yappings; resented the whole unfathomable
imbecility of war.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with something of the mechanical precision of a good
clerk posting a ledger, the riflemen moved their knobs and pressed
their buttons....</p>

<p>The captain of Land Ironclad Number Three had halted on the crest
close to his captured half-battery. His lined-up prisoners stood hard
by and waited for the cyclists behind to come for them. He surveyed the
victorious morning through his conning-tower.</p>

<p>He read the general's signals. "Five and Four are to keep among the
guns to the left and prevent any attempt to recover them. Seven and
Eleven and Twelve, stick to the guns you have got; Seven, get into
position to command the guns taken by Three. Then, we're to do
something else, are we? Six and One, quicken up to about ten miles an
hour and walk round behind that camp to the levels near the
river&mdash;-we shall bag the whole crowd of them," interjected the
young man. "Ah, here we are! Two and Three, Eight and Nine, Thirteen
and Fourteen, space out to a thousand yards, wait for the word, and
then go slowly to cover the advance of the cyclist infantry against any
charge of mounted troops. That's all right. But where's Ten? Halloa!
Ten to repair and get movable as soon as possible. They've broken up
Ten!"</p>

<p>The discipline of the new war machines was business-like rather than
pedantic, and the head of the captain came down out of the
conning-tower to tell his men. "I say, you chaps there. They've broken
up Ten. Not badly, I think; but anyhow, he's stuck."</p>

<p>But that still left thirteen of the monsters in action to finish up
the broken army.</p>

<p>The war correspondent stealing down his gully looked back and saw
them all lying along the crest and talking fluttenng congratulatory
flags to one another. Their iron sides were shining golden in the light
of the rising sun.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V.</h2>

<p>The private adventures of the war correspondent terminated in
surrender about one o'clock in the afternoon, and by that time he had
stolen a horse, pitched off it, and narrowly escaped being rolled upon;
found the brute had broken its leg, and shot it with his revolver. He
had spent some hours in the company of a squad of dispirited riflemen,
had quarrelled with them about topography at last, and gone off by
himself in a direction that should have brought him to the banks of the
river and didn't. Moreover, he had eaten all his chocolate and found
nothing in the whole world to drink. Also, it had become extremely hot.
From behind a broken, but attractive, stone wall he had seen far away
in the distance the defender-horsemen trying to charge cyclists in open
order, with land ironclads outflanking them on either side. He had
discovered that cyclists could retreat over open turf before horsemen
with a sufficient margin of speed to allow of frequent dismounts and
much terribly effective sharpshooting; and he had a sufficient
persuasion that those horsemen, having charged their hearts out, had
halted just beyond his range of vision and surrendered. He had been
urged to sudden activity by a forward movement of one of those machines
that had threatened to enfilade his wall. He had discovered a fearful
blister on his heel.</p>

<p>He was now in a scrubby gravelly place, sitting down and meditating
on his pocket-handkerchief, which had in some extraordinary way become
in the last twenty-four hours extremely ambiguous in hue. "It's the
whitest thing I've got," he said.</p>

<p>He had known all along that the enemy was east, west, and south of
him, but when he heard war Ironclads Number's One and Six talking in
their measured, deadly way not half a mile to the north he decided to
make his own little unconditional peace without any further risks. He
was for hoisting his white flag to a bush and taking up a position of
modest obscurity near it, until someone came along. He became aware of
voices, clatter, and the distinctive noises of a body of horse, quite
near, and he put his handkerchief in his pocket again and went to see
what was going forward.</p>

<p>The sound of firing ceased, and then as he drew near he heard the
deep sounds of many simple, coarse, but hearty and noble-hearted
soldiers of the old school swearing with vigour.</p>

<p>He emerged from his scrub upon a big level plain, and far away a
fringe of trees marked the banks of the river. In the center of the
picture was a still intact road bridge, and a big railway bridge a
little to the right. Two land ironclads rested, with a general air of
being long, harmless sheds, in a pose of anticipatory peacefulness
right and left of the picture, completely commanding two miles and more
of the river levels. Emerged and halted a few yards from the scrub was
the remainder of the defender's cavalry, dusty, a little disordered and
obviously annoyed, but still a very fine show of men. In the middle
distance three or four men and horses were receiving medical
attendance, and nearer a knot of officers regarded the distant
novelties in mechanism with profound distaste. Everyone was very
distinctly aware of the twelve other ironclads, and of the multitude of
townsmen soldiers, on bicycles or afoot, encumbered now by prisoners
and captured war-gear but otherwise thoroughly effective, who were
sweeping like a great net in their rear.</p>

<p>"Checkmate," said the war correspondent, walking out into the open.
"But I surrender in the best of company. Twenty-four hours ago I
thought war was impossible&mdash;and these beggars have captured the
whole blessed army! Well! Well!" He thought of his talk with the young
lieutenant. "If there's no end to the surprises of science, the
civilized people have it, of course. As long as their science keeps
going they will necessarily be ahead of open-country men. Still...." He
wondered for a space what might have happened to the young
lieutenant.</p>

<p>The war correspondent was one of those inconsistent people who
always want the beaten side to win. When he saw all these burly,
sun-tanned horsemen, disarmed and dismounted and lined up; when he saw
their horses unskillfully led away by the singularly not equestrian
cyclists to whom they had surrendered; when he saw these truncated
Paladins watching this scandalous sight, he forgot altogether that he
had called these men "cunning louts" and wished them beaten not
four-and-twenty hours ago. A month ago he had seen that regiment in its
pride going forth to war, and had been told of its terrible prowess,
how it could charge in open order with each man firing from his saddle,
and sweep before it anything else that ever came out to battle in any
sort of order, foot or horse. And it had had to fight a few score of
young men in atrociously unfair machines!</p>

<p>"Manhood <i>versus</i> Machinery" occurred to him as a suitable
headline. Journalism curdles all one's mind to phrases.</p>

<p>He strolled as near the lined-up prisoners as the sentinels seemed
disposed to permit and surveyed them and compared their sturdy
proportions with those of their lightly built captors.</p>

<p>"Smart degenerates," he muttered. "An&aelig;mic cockneydom"</p>

<p>The surrendered officers came quite close to him presently, and he
could hear the colonel's high-pitched tenor. The poor gentleman had
spent three years of arduous toil upon the best material in the world
perfecting that shooting from the saddle charge, and he was mourning
with phrases of blasphemy, natural under the circumstances what one
could be expected to do against this suitably consigned
ironmongery.</p>

<p>"Guns," said some one.</p>

<p>"Big guns they can walk round. You can't shift big guns to keep pace
with them and little guns in the open they rush. I saw 'em rushed. You
might do a surprise now and then&mdash;assassinate the brutes,
perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might make things like 'em."</p>

<p>"What? <i>More</i> ironmongery? Us?...."</p>

<p>"I'll call my article," meditated the war correspondent, "'Mankind
<i>versus</i> Ironmongery,' and quote the old boy at the
beginning."</p>

<p>And he was much too good a journalist to spoil his contrast by
remarking that the half-dozen comparatively slender young men in blue
pajamas who were standing about their victorious land ironclad,
drinking coffee and eating biscuits, had also in their eyes and
carriage something not altogether degraded below the level of a
man.</p>
