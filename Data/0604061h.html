<h1><a name="p01" id="p01">PART I</a></h1>
<h1>MR. LITTLEPAGE</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c101" id="c101">I</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr. Virginius Curle Littlepage, who had his reason apart from
the weather for a melancholy view of life, stood at the window of
his law office and looked out upon a depressing afternoon in
November. Against blown sheets of rain his large, benign head was
dimly etched by the firelight. At fifty-seven, his dark hair was
still thick and only a little grey on the temples; his ruddy
Georgian features were still noble in contour; and his short,
well-fed figure, though a trifle stout at the waist, was still
imposing in carriage. For he was one of those Virginian pillars
of society that are held upright less by singleness of heart than
by the firm support of woman's influence.</p>
<p>Without, he saw clouds, rain, mist, a few scudding yellow
leaves from a tormented elm, and all the uniform ugliness of a
commercial invasion. Within, illumined by the sunken fire of his
youth, he looked back upon the creditable years of his life, and
felt that he hated them. When had he really lived? When, in all
his successful career, had he reached after happiness? When, even
for an hour, had he taken the thing that he wanted? Gazing down
on the flooded High Street in Queenborough, he told himself that
he had learned to bridle his impulses from the hour of his birth.
He had respected convention; he had deferred to tradition. Yet
to-day, by this dying flare of the years, all the sober pleasures
he had known appeared as worthless as cinders. "What is the
meaning of it?" he asked, with a start of dismay. "Is it middle
age? Is it the fatal inadequacy of all human experience? Or is it
merely that I have become a disappointed idealist?"</p>
<p>A philosopher by habit of mind, he persisted in his search for
the cause beneath his disenchantment with life. "I've had more
than most men," he continued precisely. "I've been successful
beyond my deserts. I was born with the things for which other men
sacrifice pleasure and health, and I've gone as far, at least in
Virginia, as my profession can take me. Moreover, I've one of the
best wives in the world, and no man could ask for three finer
children. Duncan, to be sure, contracted a form of moral
dyspepsia in the war; but any father ought to be satisfied with
so normal a son as Curle. Common, perhaps, in spite of his blood,
though a taint of vulgarity, as Marmaduke would say, helps a man
to feel at home in his world. And Mary Victoria! A girl like Mary
Victoria, blessed with beauty, sense, character, and
determination, scarcely needed a world at war and a white veil to
turn her into a heroine. True, she stayed abroad too long when
she went back after the Armistice. But in a few hours she will be
home again, and we shall soon have forgotten how we've missed
her. . . . Yes, my children are all right, and so, of course, is
their mother. When I think of the nervous and naggling wives that
drive men to despair, I ought to be thankful that Victoria has
never lost control of herself since she married me. No, it is not
that. Something else must be wrong. I seem to have had
everything, yet I feel--I've felt for months--as if I'd never had
anything that I wanted. The war, I suppose. But the war has been
over for five years, and I've had time enough to grow used to the
changes. Unless"--he drew his breath in horror--"I've all along
missed the excitement we lived in." Though he told himself that
the memory of the war had sunk in a black chill to the very pit
of his soul, he knew that nothing else could be compared in
vehemence with that witches' sabbath of released desires. "For
once we were natural," he thought, while the sensation of cold
nausea crept from its retreat and invaded his mind. "We were
trying to be too superior, and it was a relief, even to the
women, especially to the women, when the savage hunger broke
through the thin crust we call civilization. It was a relief to
us all, no doubt, to be able to think murder and call it
idealism. But the war wasn't the worst thing," he concluded
grimly. "The worst thing is this sense of having lost our way in
the universe. The worst thing is that the war has made peace seem
so futile. It is just as if the bottom had dropped out of
idealism. . . ."</p>
<p>Behind him the door opened and shut. Without turning, he was
aware that the younger of his two secretaries laid a pile of
letters in front of the immense ebony inkstand, shaped like an
elephant, which his wife had given him on his birthday a few
weeks before. While he looked at the rain, he could see the ivory
and dusk of the girl in the firelight. Her name was Milly Burden,
and he had found her attractive enough to arrest his attention
without unsettling the stable equilibrium of his emotions. For
nearly six years she had remained more or less of a mystery; and
though she had remained more or less of a mystery, he had always
respected her. In the beginning his ideals had restrained him;
and after he had lost his ideals, an obscure aversion, familiar
to him as the instincts of a gentleman, had adequately taken
their place. He pitied her; he had become sincerely attached to
her; but all modern youth was too hard, too flippant, too brazen,
he felt, to awaken romantic desire. Had he been capable of desire
without romance, he would still have harboured a prejudice in
favour of severe virtue in women. Not all his affection for Milly
Burden, not all his admiration for her courage and the
flower-like blue of her eyes, could blind him to the fact that
she had once forgotten her modesty. Other women, it is true, had
forgotten their modesty even in Queenborough, where modesty,
though artfully preserved, was by no means invulnerable. But
these other women, though one of them was his own poor Aunt
Agatha and another was his attractive, if unfortunate, neighbour,
Mrs. Dalrymple, were all safely provided for either by the code
of a gentleman or by the wages of sin. With Milly Burden,
however, there was a difference. From the beginning of their
acquaintance she had treated the feminine sense of sin with the
casual modern--or was it merely the casual masculine touch? Ever
since the unhappy occasion near the end of the war, when she had
become involved in those troubles that overtake women who are
more generous than prudent, he had waited in vain for the first
sign of repentance. She had, he knew, suffered desperately. Not
even poor Aunt Agatha, wrapped in her sense of sin as in
perpetual widow's weeds, had loved more unwisely than Milly. The
difference, he perceived reluctantly, was less in the measure
than in the nature of their guilty passions. While poor Aunt
Agatha, condemned by the precepts of beautiful behaviour to her
third-story back bedroom, had mourned the loss of her virtue,
Milly Burden, typing his letters with light fingers and a
despairing heart, had mourned only the loss of her lover. The war
had taken him away from her; and, with a dark and bitter passion,
she had hated the war and all the contagious war idealism which
had swept Mary Victoria, like a winged victory in a Red Cross
uniform, as far as the distressed but animated Balkan kingdoms.
Though he had disapproved of Milly, it was pleasant to remember
now that he had protected her. Her youth, her gallantry, and her
imprudent passion, had stirred him more deeply than he had ever
dared to confess. Assisted by his wife, he had helped the girl in
her trouble, and, opposed by his wife, he had received her again
when her trouble was over. Her story was common enough, but he
was sufficiently discerning to realize that Milly herself was
unusual. Her indifference to what in a Victorian lady he would
have called her frailty, appeared in some incredible fashion to
redeem her character. "After all, is it the sense of sin that
makes the fallen woman?" he asked himself in serious disturbance
of mind.</p>
<p>This had occurred more than five years before, and while he
had meditated on the painful nature of her problems, Milly had
looked up at him with disaster, and yet something stronger than
disaster in her deep blue eyes.</p>
<p>"Does he know of--of this?" Mr. Littlepage had asked, with
sternness.</p>
<p>"I haven't told him. He couldn't do anything, and besides, he
is miserable. He isn't a fighter. He was always afraid of life.
Some men are, you know. That makes it harder for me. I am living
with his fear all the time."</p>
<p>"And not with your own?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not like that. I haven't enough imagination. I take
what comes, but I don't go out looking for trouble. Martin
does."</p>
<p>"Is his name Martin?"</p>
<p>"Martin Welding. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"I am not sure. Was his mother an Annersley?" Vaguely he had
remembered that one of the obscure Annersley girls had married a
Welding, who had proved worthless and finally taken to drink.</p>
<p>"Yes. She is dead now."</p>
<p>"What does he do?"</p>
<p>"He was in a bank. There wasn't much in that, but he was
trying to write. He is only twenty-two."</p>
<p>Twenty-two, and Milly, at the time, was not yet nineteen!
"Well, if I were you, my dear, I should let him know of this," he
had said gently, while Milly wept with a violence that penetrated
his heart.</p>
<p>"I am not thinking about this. I am thinking that I may never
see him again," she had sobbed, as she dried her eyes.</p>
<p>Whether she had told Martin or not, Mr. Littlepage had never
discovered. By the time she came out of the hospital, where the
child, blighted by Mrs. Burden's moral sense, had withered
immediately, the war was already over, and he had thought it
wiser, as well as kinder, to ask no questions. Then, three years
later, she had broken through her reserve in the hope that his
daughter, who was employed in the reconstruction of Europe, might
help to find Martin Welding.</p>
<p>"But the war has been over for almost three years, my dear.
Where has he been all this time?"</p>
<p>"He was sent home in a hospital ship. For six months they kept
him in St. Elizabeth's. I went there every Sunday when they would
let me see him."</p>
<p>"And you said nothing about it?"</p>
<p>"What was there to say? I saved all my money for those trips.
I never spent a penny on myself."</p>
<p>"So that was why--" Overwhelmed by the discovery, Mr.
Littlepage had gazed at her through an iridescent film of
emotion. That was why she had appeared so much shabbier than Miss
Dorset, who was independent in means and superior to men.</p>
<p>"Yes, that was why."</p>
<p>"And I never suspected."</p>
<p>"There wasn't anything to suspect."</p>
<p>"In all that time did you tell him?"</p>
<p>A look of agony, which he had never forgotten, convulsed her
thin features. "How could I? They said in the hospital that we
must tell him nothing depressing. I always hoped that when he was
well again everything would be just as it was before. Love can
keep alive on so little hope."</p>
<p>"But didn't you see him after he left the hospital?"</p>
<p>"Not often. After he got his discharge, he tried to find work
in New York. That was too far for me to go, and he could not
afford to come home. Then suddenly he went back to France."</p>
<p>"Didn't he see you before he sailed?"</p>
<p>"No, he wrote from the ship. He was at the end of his luck, he
said. Everything had failed him, and he had had to borrow money
to go back in the steerage. He hated America, and he hoped that,
if he went back to France, he might be able to write what he felt
about it. If he ever got on his feet again, he said, he would
send for me, and he added that but for me he should have given up
hope. When he was in the hospital he wanted to kill himself."</p>
<p>An unmitigated cad, Mr. Littlepage had reflected; and while he
watched her stricken eyes (the eyes of a dying hope, he thought
sentimentally), he had mused upon the singular power that
masculine cads exercise over the feminine mind.</p>
<p>"Did he write after he went back to France?"</p>
<p>"Only in the beginning. At first he was lonely and miserable,
and he seemed eager for me to write to him. Then his letters
stopped suddenly. It has been almost six months since I heard
from him. I want to find out the truth. Even if he is dead, even
if he has killed himself, I must find out the truth. Anything is
better than this suspense."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll see what I can do, my child." Mr. Littlepage had
promised readily, for he had one of the kindest hearts in the
world; and before going to bed that night, he had written a vague
but urgent letter to his daughter. If anything could be done, he
assured himself in distress, Mary Victoria, who had a firm hand
with an emergency, would he equal to the occasion. Not only was
Milly as dear, by this time, as a second and less formidable
daughter, but he was sentimental enough to deal mildly with love
when it did not endanger either his peace or his prospects. That
Mary Victoria was more than equal to the event was proved, within
a reasonable space of time, by a triumphant cable which announced
that Martin Welding had been found in a provincial French
hospital. He was suffering, the message briefly divulged, from "a
nervous collapse," and this was followed by the encouraging
words, "We are helping him." Several months later she had written
that Martin was out of the hospital, but still subject to attacks
of depression, and unwilling to return to America because he felt
he had made a failure of life. "We have offered him the position
of secretary in our orphanage," she had concluded, "and he may go
back with us to the Balkans. It seems the best thing for him to
do." Two years had passed since that letter, but there had been
no other mention of Martin. Though Mr. Littlepage had asked many
questions, Mary Victoria had neglected to answer them. Apparently
the young man with the inadequate nervous system had dropped out
of her noble and active life, and she seemed to be occupied with
more important affairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c102" id="c102">II</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"I wonder why Mary Victoria never told us what happened," he
mused this afternoon, while his mind turned back to the silence
and anxiety of all the years since the war. "Did something occur
that she couldn't bear writing us? Is it possible that the chap
went out of his mind or even made away with himself?" Well,
whatever had happened, he could do no good by beginning this
futile speculation all over again. In a few hours, unless there
had been a delay with the Customs, his daughter would be in his
arms and could no longer evade a reply. Suspense had been hard;
but it was unfair to expect Mary Victoria to realize the slow
torture of a referred catastrophe. Meanwhile, the best way was to
put Milly's anxiety out of his thoughts. . . . Should he go on to
his club in the hope of diversion? Or would it be easier, as well
as more prudent, to wait, as he had promised, until Victoria
stopped by for him? . . .</p>
<p>Through his slow but thorough mind there floated a disquieting
vision of his favourite club. Shivering in the chill dawn of
prohibition, he watched a few timid drinkers (Ah, degenerate
scions of the Virginian throats of hickory!) measure out their
evening thimblefuls of old Bourbon. "No, there's nothing in that
for me," he thought gloomily, and decided that it would be wiser
to wait until his wife picked him up on her way home from a
lecture.</p>
<p>Victoria, he knew, could be trusted to come early. Though she
had found time, since the children were grown, to take part in
several major reforms, she had never failed to put the duties of
marriage above the urgent needs of philanthropy. There was, too,
this other reason to expect promptness to-day, since their only
daughter, and the youngest of their three fine children, was
coming home after a long absence. Having gone abroad with the Red
Cross in the last year of the war, she had returned after the
Armistice to do her independent duty by the Balkan Peninsula. A
girl of much character, which she had inherited from her mother,
handsome, capable, high-minded, and almost automatically
inspiring, she was one of those earnest women who are designed to
curb the lower nature of man. Even at a tender age, when she had
left her play to guide her blind uncle Stephen Brooke through the
decorous shadows of Washington Street, she had inclined her
infant ear by choice rather than compulsion to the Stern Daughter
of the Voice of God. At seventeen she had become engaged, against
the wishes of her parents, to a youthful missionary, Episcopal
but devout, who had been indiscreetly assigned to the Congo. From
this mistaken sacrifice she was saved only by the invasion of
Belgium; and Mr. Littlepage had become ignobly reconciled to a
world conflict that diverted Mary Victoria's mission from the
Congo, where faces are incurably black, to the Balkan kingdoms,
where, he charitably assumed, they are merely sallow. But it was
a relief, nevertheless, to find how all the romantic satyrs of
the Balkans were repulsed by Mary Victoria's moral idealism.
After all, there was more than a grain of truth in that favourite
proverb of the Southern gentleman, "A woman's virtue is its best
defence." Though he had missed her sadly, for he was a devoted
father, he had been prevented by a legal conference from meeting
her on the dock, and in his place he had sent Curle, a popular
young man, without charm, but as loud and bright and brisk as the
New South. In spite of Mr. Littlepage's love for his daughter,
and his sincere pride in her achievements abroad (were not her
boxes filled with glittering decorations bestowed by those
countries that are content to honour rather than imitate
altruism?), he was unable, when he thought of her, to dismiss a
feeling of paternal inadequacy. For Mary Victoria deserved, he
felt, a more celebrated father; a father who had distinguished
himself, if not in war, which is an exclusive field, at least in
the less favourable path of private virtue. She deserved a second
parent after the finer pattern of her mother, who was, as Mr.
Littlepage had every reason to know, a match for any moral
necessity.</p>
<p>After thirty years of married happiness, he could still remind
himself that Victoria was endowed with every charm except the
thrilling touch of human frailty. Though her perfection
discouraged pleasures, especially the pleasures of love, he had
learned in time to feel the pride of a husband in her natural
frigidity. For he still clung, amid the decay of moral
platitudes, to the discredited ideal of chivalry. In his youth
the world was suffused with the after-glow of the long Victorian
age, and a graceful feminine style had softened the manners, if
not the natures, of men. At the end of that interesting epoch,
when womanhood was exalted from a biological fact into a
miraculous power, Virginius Littlepage, the younger son of an old
and affluent family, had married Victoria Brooke, the
grand-daughter of a tobacco planter, who had made a satisfactory
fortune by forsaking his plantation and converting tobacco into
cigarettes. While Virginius had been trained by stern tradition
to respect every woman who had not stooped to folly, the virtue
peculiar to her sex was among the least of his reasons for
admiring Victoria. She was not only modest, which was usual in
the 'nineties, but she was beautiful, which is unusual in any
decade. In the beginning of their acquaintance he had gone even
further and ascribed intellect to her; but a few months of
marriage had shown this to be merely one of the many delusions
created by perfect features and a noble expression. Everything
about her had been smooth and definite, even the tones of her
voice and the way her light brown hair, which she wore à la
Pompadour, was rolled stiffly back from her forehead and coiled
in a burnished rope on the top of her head. A serious young man,
ambitious to attain a place in the world more brilliant than the
secluded seat of his ancestors, he had been impressed at their
first meeting by the compactness and precision of Victoria's
orderly mind. For in that earnest period the minds, as well as
the emotions, of lovers were orderly. It was an age when eager
young men flocked to church on Sunday morning, and eloquent
divines discoursed upon the Victorian poets in the middle of the
week. He could afford to smile now when he recalled the solemn
Browning class in which he had first lost his heart. How
passionately he had admired Victoria's virginal features! How
fervently he had envied her competent but caressing way with the
poet! Incredible as it seemed to him now, he had fallen in love
with her while she recited from the more ponderous passages in
<i>The Ring and the Book.</i> He had fallen in love with her
then, though he had never really enjoyed Browning, and it had
been a relief to him when the Unseen, in company with its
illustrious poet, had at last gone out of fashion. Yet, since he
was disposed to admire all the qualities he did not possess, he
had never ceased to respect the firmness with which Victoria
continued to deal in other forms with the Absolute. As the placid
years passed, and she came to rely less upon her virginal
features, it seemed to him that the ripe opinions of her youth
began to shrink and flatten as fruit does that has hung too long
on the tree. She had never changed, he realized, since he had
first known her; she had become merely riper, softer, and sweeter
in nature. Her advantage rested where advantage never fails to
rest, in moral fervour. To be invariably right was her single
wifely failing. For his wife, he sighed, with the vague unrest of
a husband whose infidelities are imaginary, was a genuinely good
woman. She was as far removed from pretence as she was from the
posturing virtues that flourish in the credulous world of the
drama. The pity of it was that even the least exacting husband
should so often desire something more piquant than goodness.</p>
<p>Although he had been contented with Victoria, he could not
deny that there had been troubled periods when he had craved
something more than marriage. This was nobody's fault, he assured
himself; least of all was it the fault of his wife. What it
meant, he supposed, was simply that marriage, like life itself,
is not superior to the migratory impulses of spring and autumn.
And if he had suffered from his thwarted longings, it was a
comfort to remember that he had made Victoria perfectly happy. It
was a comfort to remember that, like all pure women everywhere,
she was satisfied with monogamy.</p>
<p>In his own vagrant seasons, since the nature of man is more
urgent, he had found himself thinking wistfully of Mrs.
Dalrymple, who, when she was not repairing her charms or her
reputation in Europe, lived on the opposite corner of Washington
Street. Too alluring for her widow's weeds, to which she imparted
a festive air by the summer bloom in her cheeks, he remembered
her as one of those fair, fond, clinging women whom men long
either to protect or to ruin. Frivolous, no doubt, yet how
appealing, how fascinating, how feminine, in her light-hearted
bereavement! Why is it, he had often wondered, that not only a
wife but even a widow appears more attractive when she is adorned
with a sprightly demeanour? When he thought of Amy Dalrymple in
his hours of leisure (the only hours in which he permitted
himself to think sentimentally of any woman), there was a motion,
a surge, a buried whirlpool, far below in some primeval flood of
his being. For the last ten years (while Mrs. Dalrymple found her
widow's ruche becoming and continued to wear it lightly), he had
asked himself, in those vagabond moods that visit husbands in
April and November, if he might have been happier with a woman
who was sometimes indiscreet, but always amusing. It was true, he
conceded reluctantly, that Amy Dalrymple was very far indeed from
what in Victorian days they had called an inspiring example.
Before her fortunate second marriage, and even more fortunate
widowhood, she was the heroine of a scandal that had shaken the
canons of refined conduct to their solid foundation. While her
husband, conforming to the dramatic style of the period, had
promptly transfixed her by a divorce, her lover, a practical
rather than a theoretical exponent of chivalry, had discreetly
married a lady of sober views and impeccable conduct. Moved by
her youth, her loneliness, her amber-coloured hair, and the
drenched brown velvet of her eyes, Mr. Littlepage, though he
usually avoided the divorce court, had consented to act as her
counsel. Victoria, who was unfashionable enough to be called a
"woman's woman," had stood by him steadfastly, and had even
appeared in the street with his amiable client. Yes, Victoria had
been wonderful from the beginning to the end of that trying
experience. Only the public conviction that she was too frigid to
harbour designs on the male sex in general had enabled her to
emerge unspotted from her noble behaviour. "She never liked Amy
Paget," mused Mr. Littlepage now. "She never liked her, yet she
was at her side when all the fair-weather friends fell away."
Strange, how often in the last few months that one generous act
had commanded his loyalty. Fifteen years ago, and it seemed only
yesterday! At the time Amy Paget, though a ruined woman, was
still young and beautiful, and nobody was astonished when, within
the next five years, she married Peter Dalrymple in Paris and
safely buried him in Père Lachaise. Mr. Littlepage had visited
the imposing marble tomb in that wilderness of lost illusions,
and he had been favourably impressed by the style, as well as by
the substance, of Mrs. Dalrymple's grief. "Fortunately her heart
was too light to sink," he thought now, with tender compassion.
"After all, she was deeply wronged, poor lady." Attired in her
soft French mourning, she had continued to flit airily between
Paris and Queenborough, until, on one of her summer flights to
her old home, Mr. Littlepage was tempted to become more than a
friend, though, perhaps, a little less than an advocate.</p>
<p>Many sober years had come and gone since that August even when
he had lingered beside Mrs. Dalrymple on the vine-draped veranda
at the back of her house. His home had seemed empty while
Victoria and the children completed an art pilgrimage in Europe;
and swayed by a fluttering impulse of curiosity, he had wandered
through the darkness toward the friendly light in Mrs.
Dalrymple's window. A business matter, she explained, had brought
her back in the dull season, which was the only season that
encouraged her to defy the gossips of Queenborough. Then she had
slipped through the French window, out under the dark and
fragrant grape-leaves, where the moonlight clustered like flowers
over her blue dress. They had talked casually of many subjects,
and not until she touched on the past had that sweet and perilous
emotion rushed like a burning wine through his senses. Still
glowing, still intoxicated, he had followed her when she fled
into the dimly lighted hall, and enfolded her in his arms. After
ten years and a world war, he could see again the way her white
lids closed like flowers over her dark eyes and her red lips (at
a period when a scarlet mouth was a badge of shame) parted with
the quivering sound of her breath. All those years and all that
conflict between them! Yet only a few hours before he had watched
her cross the pavement and step into her car, and he had suffered
again the dull ache of unsatisfied longing. That one glimpse
after her long absence (for she also had obeyed the summons to
world service) had shown him that she was still youthful, still
seductive, though her once shapely figure was now severely
repressed and her lustrous hair was flattened in shallow waves
over her ears. Just the sight of her in the street had made him
feel suddenly ardent within, as if that flitting view of charms
he might once have possessed was a reminder that he was not yet
too old for temptation. For he had not forgotten that beneath
those Bacchic garlands he might have been, but was not, a
conqueror. Even to-day the memory vibrated in his steady nerves,
while he felt that some remembered delight awakened a faint echo
of rapture. Of all his tender recollections this, he told
himself, was the only one that aroused a reminiscent emotion.
This was the only one, too, that he had been able to bury away
from Victoria. Other secrets he had kept, but they were all of an
innocent nature. He had, it is true, suppressed the obscure
indiscretions of railways; he had even suppressed the simple
indiscretions of secretaries; but his share in these hidden
misdemeanours had been invariably blameless.</p>
<p>After the rapture of that August evening why, he wondered now,
had he awakened the next morning with diminished ardour? Why had
his desire, with the innate perversity that makes desire so
unsound as a guide to behaviour, dissolved into a mixture of
bitterness and regret? Where was that hidden flaw in his nature
which made it harder for him to commit a pleasure than to perform
a duty, which compelled him to hesitate and fail in the hour of
adventure? Where was the moral scruple that commanded him to give
up Mrs. Dalrymple before he had fallen in love with her? The
following evening, though he knew that she waited for him, he had
taken a heartless satisfaction in the thought of her
disappointment. While he wrote a long and unusually demonstrative
letter to Victoria, he had been astonished to find that even an
imaginary infidelity had restored his relish for the temperate
joys of marriage. To-day he could reflect, with the surprise of a
husband and the complacency of a philosopher, that he loved
Victoria the more because he had been so nearly unfaithful. Such,
he meditated deeply, are the inscrutable contradictions of
passion. Such are the concessions to nature in the code of a
gentleman. Was modern youth, he asked despondently, capable of
these logical inconsistencies and these swift recoils? Was there,
after all, so great a disparity between two social epochs as
people liked to pretend? Women appeared different on the surface;
but had they actually changed beneath their figures? Was the
heart in Milly's flat little chest still as erratic as the heart
in Mrs. Dalrymple's once opulent bosom? For even Mrs. Dalrymple's
bosom, he had not failed to observe, was no longer opulent.
Almost insensibly this led him to a deeper and more delicate
speculation. Could she have changed also within? Had her ardent
temperament decreased with her diminishing shape? For was it
reasonable to imagine that a flat bosom could contain all the
true womanliness provided by the ample curves of the
'nineties?</p>
<p>A few weeks after his old desertion of her Amy Dalrymple had
closed her house and sailed for Europe. Before he heard of her
again his wife and children had returned with improved opinions
and modest but fashionable appearances. Dullness has no right to
grow middle-aged, he had mused the first evening at dinner, while
he listened to the opinions that Victoria had assembled as
methodically as Curle had supplied his album with postage stamps.
Then, aided by his disastrous adventure, his marriage had
relapsed into the serene monotony that so often wears the aspect
of happiness. He had believed himself to be contented until the
war in Europe had inflamed all those repressions that it failed
to set free, and the Peace of Versailles had extended more
important frontiers than physical boundaries. Presently, when the
flood of war idealism had subsided, he discovered that Mrs.
Dalrymple's indiscretion had diminished in size. New and perhaps
ignoble standards had emerged from the conflict. For the
decadence of Europe was slowly undermining Virginian tradition,
and even the Southern gentleman, he told himself, was beginning
to suspect that the ruined woman is an invention of man. Was it
possible, Mr. Littlepage inquired, fearfully but hopefully, that
there was something wrong with the past? Deeper than law, sharper
than logic, this corroding doubt penetrated his mind. Was there a
fatal flaw even in the Episcopal Church? Was the ideal of pure
womanhood infested with moth and decay? Beneath these derisive
questions, it seemed to him that the stern but noble features of
the categorical imperative had been battered beyond recognition.
How often in his youth had he heard his father lament somebody's
"loss of faith," as if such a deprivation were a calamity. Yet he
himself had found that a world without earnest conviction could
be far from uncomfortable. It afforded, among other luxuries,
ample leisure to regret all the pleasant opportunities that one
had missed in the past. And gradually, as he grew more relaxed in
principle, he began to sweeten disapproval with tenderness when
he thought of Amy Dalrymple's frailty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c103" id="c103">III</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mr. Littlepage, you have forgotten to sign your letters."</p>
<p>The voice was reproachful, and he glanced round with a
whimsical apology in his soft brown eyes. "I'm sorry, Milly. I am
not often so careless. You must find excuses for me to-day," he
added in the playful tone he reserved for sentiment. "I am as
useless as an expectant lover."</p>
<p>Milly looked at him with the composed tolerance of modern
youth. "Your daughter has been away a long time."</p>
<p>"She went the week you came. That, I think, is one of the
reasons I've always felt you were related to me."</p>
<p>"Well, it wouldn't have made any difference. You couldn't have
been kinder."</p>
<p>"There were perhaps better ways, but I was too stupid to think
of them. Whenever you looked unhappy I thought of Mary Victoria
in the Balkans--or even in Paris."</p>
<p>"She wasn't obliged to go back, was she?" There was an accent
of derision in Milly's voice.</p>
<p>He smiled indulgently, for his sense of humour, unlike
Victoria's, embraced not only his wife and himself, but his
children as well. "She thought so. You see, the war didn't last
long enough to exhaust her moral energy. She was obliged to use
up a good deal that was left over. She remembered the distress in
the Balkans, and of course there is always Armenia."</p>
<p>"Anyhow, I'm glad for your sake that she is coming home."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm glad, of course, but--I may as well admit it--I'm a
little afraid--"</p>
<p>"Afraid? You mean she may have changed?"</p>
<p>"It isn't only that. I suppose I've missed her too much. Are
you waiting for these letters?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll come back after I've got my coat. Everyone else has
gone."</p>
<p>As the girl left the room, he turned back to his desk, while
his whole being was swept by paternal solicitude. Was Victoria,
he wondered, suffering from this anxious expectancy? Could even a
mother have hungered more acutely for the sight of a daughter?
All day it had been impossible to govern his mind properly when
he remembered that every hour, every minute, was bringing Mary
Victoria nearer his arms. Ever since she had cabled him the date
of her sailing, he had waited her return with a curious mingling
of delight and reluctance. Hope and fear were so blended that he
had long ago ceased to distinguish between the conflicting
emotions. Whenever he thought of Mary Victoria, it seemed to him
that his heart dissolved into a rainbow mist, and flowered anew
in the vision of a little girl wearing a short white frock with
starched frills and a blue sash tied in a big bow at the back of
her waist. Always she came to him like this; never older, never
younger, than she had looked at the age of seven. He saw again
her shining auburn curls, confined by a blue ribbon, her innocent
grey eyes beneath winged eyebrows, her sturdy sunburned legs in
white socks that were ribbed at the top, and her blunt childish
feet in black kid slippers with prim straps at the ankles.
Nothing in his whole life, not Victoria in her bridal veil, not
Curle in his soldier's uniform, not Mary Victoria marching in a
Red Cross parade, had ever touched him so deeply as the image of
those helpless feet in white socks and black slippers. The living
Mary Victoria had outgrown his protection. She had advanced so
far ahead of him that her nearness as a daughter had diminished
while her stature as a philanthropist increased with the
distance. What remained to him, he sometimes felt, was only a
vision painted on air of a child with clustering curls, eyes as
innocent as stars, and bare sunburned knees above the ribbed
bands of her socks.</p>
<p>Having signed the letters, he lighted a cigar and sat
nervously smoking until Milly returned.</p>
<p>"You've been working too hard," he remarked as he looked up at
her.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "No, it isn't that. It isn't work." Her
face looked pale and tired; her usually smooth dark hair had
drifted down in a mist over her forehead; her dress, an old one
that she wore on wet days, was faded and unbecoming; but her
eyes, large, deep, radiantly blue, were burning with life. Judged
by the waxen ideal of the 'nineties, he knew that she was not
beautiful. Beside Mrs. Dalrymple's rose-leaf bloom and texture,
Milly's face, he reflected, would appear almost wasted. There
were hollows in her thin cheeks and her small, white teeth were
uneven; yet these hollows and this unevenness became, when she
smiled, a part of her indescribable charm. Months went by, since
few men were less predatory, when he was scarcely aware of her
presence. Then, suddenly, without warning, the recollection of
his absent daughter would bring Milly into his mind, and he would
awaken to the bright audacity in her laugh, or to the look of
wistful expectancy in her April eyes. For an instant he would
become intensely alive to her gaiety, her suffering, and her
defiant courage. "Is it possible," he would ask himself, with a
start, "that a woman can be noble without goodness or good
without virtue?"</p>
<p>"If it isn't work," he said gently, "it must be worry,
Milly."</p>
<p>The corners of her lips quivered. "Well, you can't help
worrying, can you?"</p>
<p>"I am not sure. People who don't worry tell us we can."</p>
<p>"Then they've never been in love. I sometimes think love isn't
anything else."</p>
<p>"Are you still unhappy, my dear?"</p>
<p>Her eyes darkened with pain. "I want Martin. I've always
wanted him."</p>
<p>"I had hoped you were getting over the worst."</p>
<p>"No, I haven't got over it. I haven't got over it even a
little."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you will when you hear something definite. I'll ask
my daughter as soon as I can see her alone. But don't hope for
too much. It is a mistake to hope for too much or you are sure to
be disappointed. If there had been good news, Mary Victoria would
have told us."</p>
<p>"You said just the opposite a year ago."</p>
<p>"Then I was trying to keep up your courage. Now I am preparing
you for a blow."</p>
<p>"Well, I shan't have long to wait. But the last hours are the
hardest."</p>
<p>"I'll call you up as soon as I speak to her. No, I'll come to
see you, that will be better. I'll have a talk with her to-night,
and if it isn't too late, I'll come straight to see you."</p>
<p>"If anything has happened to Martin, I don't want to live, I
don't want to live."</p>
<p>"Do you still care as much as that?"</p>
<p>"As much as that?" Her tears were brimming over. "I love him.
I've loved him since the first minute."</p>
<p>"How old were you then?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't eighteen until August, but I knew what I
wanted."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't blame your mother for thinking you were too
young."</p>
<p>"She hated Martin. She never had happiness and she could not
bear the thought of my having it."</p>
<p>"You must not say things like that, Milly."</p>
<p>"But it is true." She looked at him defiantly. "What good
comes of lying about things? People used to believe in lying, but
we don't any longer."</p>
<p>"Do you believe in anything now, Milly?"</p>
<p>"Not in shams. I have a right to my own happiness as long as I
play the game fairly."</p>
<p>"And you think that you have played the game fairly?"</p>
<p>"Haven't I?" Her eyes were like blue flames. "My life is my
own. I haven't hurt anybody but myself."</p>
<p>"Are you sure of that, Milly? You must have brought pain to
your mother."</p>
<p>"It was her own fault. She tried to manage my life. She tried
to make me into what she was at my age."</p>
<p>"Can you blame her for that? She believed it was best, for
you."</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't that. She simply couldn't bear my having a life
of my own. She has always thought happiness immoral. That was why
I had to run out to Martin at night after she went to bed. She
never let me see him at home. She never let me see anybody."</p>
<p>"I suppose she thought she was right."</p>
<p>"She has always thought that. Her thinking that drove father
away from home."</p>
<p>He looked at her sternly. Oh, modern youth, modern youth! "You
must control yourself, Milly."</p>
<p>"Would you rather I'd be deceitful?"</p>
<p>"I'd rather you'd show proper respect for your mother."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to say I love her? I don't. I don't even like
her. She has ruined my life. I had a right to my life, and she
has ruined it."</p>
<p>"Other people can't ruin our lives."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't say that if you knew mother better. She could
ruin anybody's life. She was afraid that I'd be like father if I
once found out that there is such a thing as happiness."</p>
<p>"She was mistaken in that. You must remember, however, that
her own life had been tragic. She had lost her other children,
and your father had deserted her."</p>
<p>"She drove him to it. I never blamed father."</p>
<p>Nor, if the truth must be told, could Mr. Littlepage, who was
imperfectly acquainted with Mrs. Burden, find it in his heart to
blame the fugitive husband. There are human rights, he mused
sadly, that should be respected even in marriage. There are
virtues so prickly that no mortal thing, not even a husband,
could be expected to live in the house with them. "No, I may be
wrong in principle and deficient in moral constitution, but I
have never felt that I could blame him." Erring, no doubt; yet
how human, how comprehensible, how heroic, some desertions appear
to a philosopher! In spite of his own happy marriage, he had
suffered all his life from a secret leaning toward faithless
husbands and other undesirable acquaintances. Vainly he had tried
to trample down these low but vigorous impulses. Vainly he had
endeavoured to prefer the right-minded and to pity only the
deserving. But something stronger than his will--was it a secret
pulse of wildness in his heart?--had urged him to an irregular
alliance with the obscure and the profligate. How much of this,
he had often speculated, was owing to his childish admiration for
his elder brother, Marmaduke, who, after driving an ambulance
under fire, and leaving a sturdy right leg in the war zone, had
climbed as high as the picturesque attic of Mrs. Burden's
lodging-house? Not that Marmaduke was impoverished; merely that
he was more or less disreputable in his opinions. Had the
repressed longings of their mother, whose nervous temperament had
overflowed into water colour, achieved a more or less permanent
form in Marmaduke's pictures? Or was it merely the prevailing
fashion of fancy-work, as his father pretended, which had
festooned their French mirrors with wild roses and decorated
their satin sofa pillows with snowy landscapes? Marmaduke,
because of his turn for painting and his zest for experience, had
been in childhood his mother's favourite; and there were glimpses
of her still in the reformed romantic, who now occupied, with the
hilarity that recollections of a well-spent life so seldom
afford, a dormered room overlooking the sunsets on James River.
Beneath this once imposing though now ramshackle roof, in an
obscure street, which had been as conspicuous for fashion as it
was now safe for bootlegging, Marmaduke painted with vehemence in
firm strokes of red, blue, and yellow. As if, Mr. Littlepage had
reasoned sadly, an artist could be sincere only in primary
colours. Devoted as he was to his brother, Marmaduke's pictures
had always seemed to Virginius too unpleasant to be natural, and
too--yes, even if he did sound like Curle and the New South--too
un-American to be really modern. For if Marmaduke had stayed in
America, and painted the outside instead of the inside of his
subjects, he might have won by now an enviable reputation, and
probably have sold his more flattering portraits of women. Even
in Queenborough, where, until recent years, conversation had been
the favourite and almost the only art patronized by the best
circles, wealthy citizens were beginning to realize that, if
books look well in a library, pictures lend even more
emphatically the right note in decoration to the walls of a
drawing-room. All this and even more Marmaduke had forfeited by
his light conduct and his intemperate opinions. . . . And the
worst of it was that Virginius found it impossible to blame
either the hostilities inEurope or the bad example of the German
army for the profligate disposition of his elder brother. Many
evils he held against them, but, being a just man, he could not
charge them with this one. Milly's wildness, he felt, might have
sprung, however indirectly, from the invasion of Belgium; but he
must look deeper and perhaps further, he knew, to find the source
of Marmaduke's moral infirmity.</p>
<p>While he meditated he had almost forgotten that Milly was
waiting, a small black hat pushed down over her eyebrows and a
purple umbrella swinging by a cord from her hand. Beneath the
dark cloud of hair, her eyes were starry and watchful.</p>
<p>"How long has it been since you heard from Martin?" he asked
suddenly.</p>
<p>"Oh, an age! He was going to the Balkans, he wrote, because it
was either that or starvation. Relief work made him sick, but
there wasn't anything else ahead of him. He told me he wasn't
worth thinking about and I'd better forget him. As if I could!"
she added passionately. "As if I could forget him just because he
is a failure!"</p>
<p>"It is a pity you can't, my dear."</p>
<p>"But I don't want to. I don't want to forget him."</p>
<p>"Well, that's even more of a pity."</p>
<p>"For a time I tried not to think of him. Everything but a part
of me seemed to forget."</p>
<p>"Was that the best part of you?"</p>
<p>"It was the deepest part. It was the little hard kernel of
memory that makes a sore all round its edge." Her features, swept
by tremulous wings of longing, were rapt and enkindled. How could
any man who had been loved like that have forgotten her? Was the
fellow mad? Or was he already dead and well out of the way?</p>
<p>"It was a pity you never told him about--about your trouble,
Milly."</p>
<p>"I tried to spare him." At her voice, which was a mere thread
of emotion, he turned to her quickly. "I never told him because I
wanted him to have only happy memories. Even if he ceased to
care, I wanted him to have only happy memories."</p>
<p>Looking at her, as she stood there in her youth and her
despairing passion, which was the youngest thing, he reflected,
about her, Mr. Littlepage reminded himself for the hundredth time
that it was impossible for a man to understand women. The firm
ones were necessarily less difficult to comprehend than the
frail; but even the firm ones were not so easy to understand as
they used to be. In the old days, Mr. Littlepage admitted, a man
had only himself to blame if he did not soon discover at least
where he stood with a woman. He thought of his father, a Virginia
gentleman of Georgian morals but Victorian manners, who had found
it less embarrassing to commit adultery than to pronounce the
word in the presence of a lady. Well, it was fortunate, no doubt,
that he had not survived the decorous nineteenth century.
Certainly the conversation, if not the conduct, of the post-war
age would have been the end of him. For the modern revolt, Mr.
Littlepage was beginning to realize, was less immoral than
experimental. The change was not merely a breaking away, as in
the case of poor Aunt Agatha or even of Mrs. Dalrymple, from
social conventions that one still respected and Sabbath
observances in which one still believed. No, the saddest thing
about Milly's past, he mused, was that she had been able to leave
it so lightly behind her. Considered merely as the sort of
impediment that had figured depressingly in <i>fin de siècle</i>
drama. Milly's wild oats looked as small and almost as harmless
as canary seed.</p>
<p>"If her life had not been spoiled, she would have made some
man a fine wife," he meditated regretfully. Though he considered
a passive attitude in love more feminine, and preferred an
amiable softness to a tragic intensity, he felt that a man who
was unacquainted with Mrs. Dalrymple might surrender to the sheer
variety of Milly's charm. What a pity it was, indeed, to discover
that charm is so often divorced from the cardinal virtues. What a
pity it was that deserving characters, who made the most
excellent wives by daylight, should be so frequently denied the
magic that works best in darkness. There was, for example,
Victoria's closest friend, Louisa Goddard, an admirable spinster,
who would have made the reputation of any man she had chosen to
marry. Tall, majestic, silver-haired, and as subdued in bosom as
she was emphatic in gesture. Louisa was scarcely less
distinguished than Mrs. Dalrymple--but with what a difference! He
admired Louisa cordially; he even liked her, though she held what
he still called "advanced opinions," and lectured upon the
obscure morals of civilizations that have crumbled to dust and
are therefore safe topics. Conspicuous in her youth for sound
sense, a handsome figure, and discreet manners, she had developed
an intrepid intellect in later years, and since the war she had
discoursed publicly but prudently upon the more interesting
theories of social reform. In this enterprise, to his mild
astonishment, Victoria, who thought evil of no persons and of few
reforms, supported her friend. "It is so important to look at
these subjects from the right moral angle," his wife had
explained, with her usual generous simplicity, "and if there is a
woman in Queenborough capable of doing this, surely it is
Louisa." To-day, after a lecture upon the Morals of Babylon,
Louisa, who was wealthy by inheritance but saving by
constitution, would certainly drive home in Victoria's car. In
common with other men Virginius admired frugality in woman almost
as fervently as he respected chastity, and even when, as in the
case of Louisa (who could never spend her income, but refused to
employ a chauffeur), economy approached the border of avarice, he
felt that the fault was merely a defect in a sterling virtue. And
what a mind she possessed! It was almost incredible, he had
confided to Victoria after an informing talk with Louisa, how
much you could learn about human depravity without vital contact
with life. Not, of course, that she was ever indelicate. She was,
on the contrary, refined enough in tone to satisfy Marmaduke, who
had the fastidious taste in such matters of a confirmed
libertine. That, Mr. Littlepage assured himself, was a reasonable
explanation not only of Marmaduke's loose living, but of his
prolonged absence from the flesh-pots of Europe. He was still
hoping, with the sanguine temper peculiar, his brother had
observed, to reformers and reprobates, that Louisa, who had
refused him at twenty and thirty, would relent at fifty and
supply him with a good and sufficient excuse for mending his
habits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c104" id="c104">IV</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Milly had slipped away while he meditated, and from the window
a little later he watched her purple umbrella tossed about by the
flying gusts in the street. How slender she looked against the
driving rain! How slender and helpless and yet how determined! It
was almost six years since she had first come to him, and in
those years, though he deplored her liberal behaviour, he had
become deeply attached to her. "I wonder if it is possible to be
kind to a woman without growing fond of her?" he thought, for his
mood was indulgent. Then, since there was still no sign of
Victoria, he turned back to his chair and diverted his mind by
moralizing upon Milly's unfortunate past. . . .</p>
<p>She had come to him on a stormy afternoon in that dreadful
last winter of the war, while Victoria was divided between the
Red Cross and an epidemic of influenza, and Mary Victoria was
inspiring the American Army in France. Why, he wondered, was that
winter fantastically associated in his mind with wild roses in
water colour and snowy landscapes on satin sofa pillows? At the
time Milly had barely recovered from influenza, and she was still
suffering from poverty and frustrated desire. Yet he had felt her
charm even then. He had felt her charm in spite of her thinness,
her pallor, the heavy circles under her romantic eyes, and the
pitiably neglected state of her clothes. After he had engaged her
(for good typists, being of adventurous disposition, were scarcer
than munition workers that winter), she had fainted from
weakness, and he had felt strangely chivalrous and paternal. Not
until spring had he discovered that her trouble was as real as
her poverty; and by that time the war and contact with
loose-living Europe had broadened the sympathies, or softened the
moral fibre, of Queenborough. Was it really the war, he asked
himself, that had at last loosened the bonds of tradition? Was it
the haunting thought of Mary Victoria, lovely and alone, among
the predatory males of Europe? Or was it the visit he had endured
from a genteel lady in weeds, who broke to him in mournful
accents that she was Milly's respectable but unhappy mother?</p>
<p>"I am sure I don't know where she gets her character,
sir."</p>
<p>"It is easy to believe that, Mrs. Burden."</p>
<p>"She was always brought up as proper as proper."</p>
<p>"I am sure of it."</p>
<p>"I sent her to Sunday school as soon as she could lisp. I took
her with me to church and to missionary societies and prayer
meetings whenever I had a decent dress to put on. Those were the
only amusements she ever had as a child, except sewing for one of
the little converts in Africa. She never ran out at night like
other girls, and it isn't my fault if she found there were wild
sorts of pleasure. I declare I don't know what the world is
coming to now, but it isn't as bad, of course, as if I had any
cause to reproach myself. I've been a good mother, and I was a
good wife, even if I wasn't treated as well as I ought to have
been. However, I didn't hold that against Albert after he died.
I've worn mourning for him now going on thirteen years or
more."</p>
<p>Such, incredible as it sounded in memory, was the nature of
Mrs. Burden's complaint. Though she had lived the better part of
three generations, she had remained mentally arrested in the
God-fearing posture of evangelical piety. Her long sallow face,
hopelessly flattened out by life, had worn an expression of
resigned but uninspired martyrdom. Above invisible eyebrows her
yellowish-grey hair was plastered down on her forehead, and her
pale, tight lips were as rigid, he had said to himself, as a
clothespin. That she should be Milly's mother had seemed to him
as incomprehensible as almost everything else in the age. Drab
features, drab voice, drab spirits. Estimable, in character, no
doubt, estimable, but depressing to any husband who had not lost
the active instincts of a vertebrate.</p>
<p>"I hope your daughter has been considerate of you," he had
remarked, with the sharp recoil every sentimentalist feels in the
presence of a repugnant fact.</p>
<p>"She ought to be, sir. I've done my duty by her, if I do say
it."</p>
<p>"I am sure she realizes that."</p>
<p>"You'd never know it if she does, sir. I sometimes think she
was born without family feeling, like her father before her."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" Mr. Littlepage felt helpless, and wondered why you
could be so much more indulgent to human nature when it was not
in the room with you. At a reasonable distance, across the
street, for instance, he had felt compassionate toward Mrs.
Burden, and had been disposed to blame Milly for a deficiency in
filial respect. "She seems to be a warm-blooded girl," he had
added impressively.</p>
<p>"She is where you don't expect it of her," Mrs. Burden had
sighed, while she sank dejectedly into her crape. "That was her
father's way, too. He would always pass over the persons who had
a right to expect feeling from him and fling himself away on
somebody without the shadow of a claim to his affection. And it
has been the same with Milly. All this would never have happened
if she had inherited a proper sense of duty."</p>
<p>"No, I suppose not. But is this young Welding the only
one?"</p>
<p>"You'd think one was enough, sir, if you'd heard the way she
took on when he went abroad. That was the first time I knew
things were not what they should be between them. It wasn't until
three months after he had sailed that I found out she'd gone
wrong, and then I begged her on my bended knees to let me write
and tell him what I thought of him. I'd have done it without
asking her, but I knew if she ever suspected it, she would desert
me just as her father did after I had him sent to gaol for his
own good."</p>
<p>"Do you know whether she writes to this young man?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden had broken into eloquent tears. "Only cheerful
letters, she says, only cheerful letters that won't make him
reproach himself."</p>
<p>This was indeed a fresh point of view, and a questionable one
even to the tolerant masculine mind. Modern, perhaps; yet he felt
sure that Mary Victoria, who was as advanced as Milly though in
an opposite direction, would have indignantly repudiated such
moral evasion. In his youth reproach had been the natural, if by
no means the only, weapon of pure womanhood, and he disliked
seeing it discarded so easily by a girl who was, to put it
mildly, no longer a shining honour to either sex. Still, since he
was unpolemical by disposition, he had remarked gently:</p>
<p>"That seems an unfeminine attitude. What is her reason?"</p>
<p>"How do I know? She never tells me anything. When I question
her, all she ever answers is that I have no right to interfere
with her life. No right to interfere! If I haven't a right to
interfere with her, is there anybody who has, sir?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. Well, it is a sad case, Mrs. Burden, a very sad
case. You have my sympathy. I will talk to your daughter, though
she will doubtless consider it an interference, and I will see
what can be done for her."</p>
<p>What he could do proved to be, in the end, more than he had
hoped, though scarcely less than he had expected. He had talked
mildly but gravely to Milly that afternoon, and finding her
tragic, mocking, and scornful of the conventions that he
esteemed, he had surprised in his heart some deep pulsations of
sympathy. Though he had been prepared to counsel the erring, he
was soon bewildered, not so much by Milly's unrepentant attitude
as by the perilous response in his own nature. It was, he had
recognized reluctantly, his duty to discharge her; and he had
intended, after making suitable provision, to fulfil his moral
obligation. For the sake of his other secretary, the impeccable
Miss Dorset, for the sake of Victoria, for the sake of his own
unsullied reputation, he told himself, it was undesirable that
Milly should remain in his office. Several particulars,
nevertheless, he had failed to consider. He had weighed
respectability, but not human relations; genteel conduct he had
taken for granted; but he had overlooked the fatal indulgence of
the paternal heart, and the softening influence of a daughter who
is as far away as the Balkans.</p>
<p>"Your mother has been to see me," he had begun sternly.</p>
<p>Light had rippled into Milly's changeable face, and it seemed
to him that the sadness in her eyes sparkled with laughter. "I am
sorry," she had answered mockingly, "I tried to spare you."</p>
<p>"She is greatly disturbed about you."</p>
<p>"Poor Mother. She is obliged to be disturbed about something.
If it isn't about me, it will be about public morals."</p>
<p>"You are making her unhappy."</p>
<p>"I don't make her so. She was born that way."</p>
<p>"She tells me," he had said severely, "that you have been very
wild."</p>
<p>Though her voice was defiant when she answered, there was, he
remembered, a springtime freshness in her eyes. "Well, we are all
wild together, aren't we? There's murder in the air."</p>
<p>"I don't like your levity, Milly. In spite of your manner, I
refuse to believe that you are incorrigible." So little, he
reflected, had she resembled the proverbial lost woman that
Goldsmith himself would scarcely have known her for what she was.
It is true that her clothes had harmonized better with the
institutional than the romantic idea of a life of sin. Her dress,
he had observed, was cheap, faded and carelessly worn, and her
shoes had borne, to his inattentive eye, every sign of having
trodden the downward path. Touched by her evident poverty, Mr.
Littlepage had thought of his daughter, and had felt his
harshness dissolve. Many things had softened his heart, but most
of all the memory of Mary Victoria as she had looked as a child.
In the end, he had decided to reprimand Milly instead of washing
his hands of her. Any good woman would have dismissed her without
regret; but men, he mused now, pricked by a sensation of guilt,
are softer by nature--or is it merely more brittle?</p>
<p>"She tells me you are in trouble," he had said.</p>
<p>"I suppose she would call it that," Milly had retorted, with
the flippancy he feared and expected.</p>
<p>"What do you call it?" How unfeminine she was beneath her
perverse gaiety!</p>
<p>"I haven't had it long enough to know. I may call it trouble,
too, before it is over."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you marry him, Milly?"</p>
<p>"How could I when we hadn't any money and there was Mother to
look after?"</p>
<p>"If you couldn't marry him, why didn't you wait?"</p>
<p>An inward storm had darkened her eyes. "I have a right to my
life."</p>
<p>No lady of the nineteenth century, neither poor Aunt Agatha,
who had been completely crushed, nor Mrs. Dalrymple, who had been
merely tarnished, by betrayal, would have asserted an inalienable
right to her life. Yet this fantastic notion appeared to be the
solitary principle that modern youth was willing to embrace. Even
Mary Victoria, who would have been an inspiring example in any
period, had taken a firm stand in defence of her natural right to
do as she pleased. The difference appeared to be that, while
Milly was satisfied with the right to her own life, Mary Victoria
demanded, from the purest motives, the right of moral
encroachment upon the lives of others. Had duty, which in his
youth meant violence to his appetite, become to-day merely a
label for unbridled impulse?</p>
<p>"As long as you know what you want most, what do you ever get
by waiting?" Milly had asked, turning upon him the unembarrassed
scrutiny with which her intrepid age regarded vital statistics.
"Look at Mother. She waited for Father until she had dried up to
a husk. Of course, if you aren't in love," she added presently,
"it is different. But, if you are in love, then you know that
nothing else really matters."</p>
<p>He had looked at her attentively. Was there, after all,
something more than selfishness in Milly's outlook on life?
Unfortunate as her lapse from virtue appeared, he could not deny
that she wore that confident air which makes a settled point of
view more respectable than a vagrant emotion. Independence of
character had acquired, on the surface at least, all the lustre
he associated with conversion from sin. It was impossible to
imagine Milly either crushed like poor Aunt Agatha or tarnished
like Mrs. Dalrymple. In demanding the right to sin, she had, he
told himself disconsolately, elevated an improper act into a
mistaken theory of conduct. Was not this, after all, the superior
advantage attained by the present vocal generation over the
reticent feminine mode of the 'nineties? To reduce behaviour to a
formula, however wanton, appeared miraculously to invest it with
the dignity of an intellectual habitation and a name.</p>
<p>"I refuse to argue with you, Milly," he had said sternly. "I
can only tell you that you have opened the door to regret."</p>
<p>He had expected contradiction, but she had astonished him,
after a thoughtful pause, by a gesture of agreement. "Oh, well, I
should have regretted either way, shouldn't I? I am always
regretting things. But the regret for what you have had doesn't
last nearly so long as the regret for what you have missed. Life
isn't for ever. What is the fun of dying before you have
lived?"</p>
<p>"The trouble is that you have learned nothing from the
past--nothing from the experience of other women."</p>
<p>"From Mother, you mean?"</p>
<p>"Not only from your mother, but from all women everywhere. You
have set out to demolish conventions before you have tested
them."</p>
<p>Her eyes had mocked him. "But, you have tested them, haven't
you? And where have they led you? Could anything that we do or
think end in a greater calamity? No, we'll have to learn the
truth for ourselves. Nothing that the older generation can tell
us will do any good. We refuse to accept your theories because we
saw them all break to pieces. The truth is we are determined to
think for ourselves and to make our own sort of ideals. Even if
everything you say to me is true, I shouldn't consent to take my
experience from you second-hand. I want to find out for myself. I
want the freedom to live my life as I please. I want to choose
the things I believe in. . . ."</p>
<p>Delusion? Sophistry? Or the simple moonstruck folly of youth?
Is it possible to reason, he had asked himself helplessly, with
frustrated desire? Useless to argue. Useless either to advise or
admonish. Since he was as generous as he was tolerant, what could
he do but invoke the forsaken ideal of chivalry and protect her,
as far as he was able, from the errors of her own undisciplined
heart?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c105" id="c105">V</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The wind whipped a spray of rain in his face, and through the
scattering mist he distinguished the fine presence of Louisa
Goddard in the back of the car. A handsome woman, notwithstanding
her years, with stiffly waved grey hair, a high flush in her thin
cheeks, and the sharpened nose that so often accompanies
virginity. Why, he speculated idly as he made his way to the car,
could not virginity preserve the figures of spinsters without
sharpening their noses? Yet, in spite of her aquiline features,
Louisa was more attractive, he admitted, than she had been as a
girl. She was one of those rare women who improve with age and
become active instead of apathetic as they grow older. Grey hair,
which he disliked as heartily as most men, had done a great deal,
he acknowledged reluctantly, for her appearance, while the
lecture platform, which he disliked even more than most men, had
done quite as much for her manner. Behind the footlights she had
acquired the courage of an evangelist and the attitudes of a
Shakespearian actress.</p>
<p>As he entered the car she leaned forward, and he met her
lively hazel eyes behind the rimless glasses which, he had
decided, were becoming as long as she did not expect him to kiss
her.</p>
<p>"Where is Victoria?" he asked when he had taken her gloved
hand. "Has anything happened?"</p>
<p>Louisa shook her head, and the light flickered from her
glasses to the reddened tip of her nose. "She was not feeling
well. She has gone home to lie down before Mary Victoria
comes."</p>
<p>"Not well? I am sorry. She overtaxes her strength."</p>
<p>"Yes, she never considers herself. It is impossible to make
her remember that she isn't so strong as she used to be. She has
never been the same since that attack of pneumonia."</p>
<p>While Louisa responded, he looked at her gravely and wondered
where her conversation was leading. Like so many women who have
missed romantic happiness, she was extravagantly fond, he felt
indulgently, of minor mysteries. With her bright flush, which had
come with middle age, her lively glance, and her vivacious
expression, she appeared to carry her years bravely. Beneath her
small black velvet hat, with the new high crown, which she wore
slightly tilted, the scalloped line of her hair gleamed like
polished silver. She dressed better than Victoria did and on less
money; but, then, he had long ago decided that unattached women
or widows, however afflicted, always managed to dress better than
matrons. Singular as it was, he had noticed that the less reason
women have for keeping up an appearance, the more time and energy
they lavish upon the effort. Take widow's weeds, for example.
What garments, especially what bonnets, could be more fetching,
more coquettish even, than the ones Mrs. Dalrymple had worn in
her bereavement? Yet she had been genuinely distressed, he knew.
Her heart, as she had so often assured him, was buried in Peter
Dalrymple's grave. Only she had not buried her dark eyes and her
amber hair behind the flowing crape of her veil. He could still
see the way her widow's ruche had intensified the brightness of
her hair, the velvet dusk of her eyes, and the bloom of her lips.
Twelve years ago, and yet--and yet--Well, she was back in
Queenborough again for the first time since the war. A little
tarnished, perhaps. Not ruined, of course, like poor Aunt Agatha
(we were not living in the 'seventies, thank God!), but still a
trifle damaged by the unsavoury, or at least indelicate,
character of her past. . . .</p>
<p>Sadly but firmly dismissing the subject, he turned back to
Louisa, who was still occupied, he could see, with her mystery.
Whatever it was, he decided after a minute, she was equally
competent to discuss or dispose of it. Had it anything to do, he
asked anxiously, with Victoria? Or was it merely one of those
unpleasant moral dilemmas that beset the slippery paths of
philanthropists? In Louisa's youth, while Marmaduke courted her
with all the ardour exacted by that romantic period, Virginius
had wondered at the fascination she exercised. There was, he had
thought, and his mother had agreed with him, something masculine
in her prominent features and her pronounced opinions upon public
affairs. Thirty-one years ago, he meditated sorrowfully, neither
prominent features nor pronounced opinions in women commanded
admiration from the opposite sex. How much of Marmaduke's long
faithfulness was owing, Mr. Littlepage had once asked himself, to
that truculent temperament which keeps the artist in perpetual
conflict with destiny? But in the last few years, and especially
in the years since the war, he had realized that, after all,
there are attractions more enduring, if less delightful, than
physical charm. There is, he admitted, with all the distaste of a
chivalrous mind, the pleasure afforded by an intelligent interest
in life. Though he was inclined to regard any spinster as a being
blighted by fate, he was obliged to acknowledge that Louisa had
attained the perfect sophistication which finds social
misdemeanours less exciting than the imponderable sins of
psychology. He glanced at her composed features (it was a pity
that the tip of her nose reddened so easily in cold weather), and
from her features to her flat bosom, firmly encased, beneath her
sealskin coat, in moral principle. Yes, decidedly a sterling
character. A trifle dictatorial, to be sure, and frigid, no
doubt, in temperament. Only by regarding Louisa as frigid in
temperament could he explain her old rejection of Marmaduke, who
had been a promising suitor in the 'nineties, before he lost his
leg and adopted the French view of sex. Yet, in her case at
least, frigidity had not, apparently, interfered with enjoyment
of life. At fifty-odd (he was sure of her exact age) she was the
happiest and the most industrious woman of his acquaintance.
Turning suddenly, she leaned toward him with an alert birdlike
movement, as if she were about to peck at a succulent morsel.
While he waited patiently enough he hoped that she was not
occupied with the mouldy problems of Babylon; for, though he
preferred ancient history to modern, he disliked and resented the
platform manner in women. Victoria, the perfect wife, reformed by
inspiration alone; but Louisa, who possessed a more active mind,
undertook to do so by both example and precept.</p>
<p>"I hope I didn't keep you waiting," she began crisply, as if
she were determined to overlook anything that he had said.</p>
<p>"Well, a little while, but I left off working earlier than
usual. I dare say I am impatient. Mary Victoria doesn't come home
every day from the Balkans."</p>
<p>Louisa smiled. "Victoria says that Mary Victoria is the
romance of your life."</p>
<p>"That is because Victoria forgets herself," he returned
gallantly.</p>
<p>"Yes, that is just what I said to her. I told her also that
she ought to be the one to prepare you."</p>
<p>"To prepare me?" From the bottom of his masculine soul he
hated mysteries and disliked having them broken to him.</p>
<p>"Victoria was not feeling well, but the real reason she went
home straight from the club was to have the blue guest room put
in order."</p>
<p>"The blue guest room? Isn't Mary Victoria's old room big
enough to held her and her Balkan decorations?"</p>
<p>"We thought so yesterday. But while Victoria was at the club,
she talked over the telephone with Curle in New York. It seems
that Mary Victoria is bringing a surprise with her. She is not
alone."</p>
<p>"Not alone? Has she adopted a war orphan?" Though he spoke in
stolid tones, he wondered if Louisa could fail to hear the
fluttering sound of his heart. For the war, as he assured
himself, was well over, and even in Queenborough, war orphans had
diminished in public esteem. It was, of course, conceivable that
Mary Victoria's orphan was not only indigent but of royal
descent. Such a combination, he had heard, was far from unusual
in the countries in which she had exercised her benevolence. But,
even so, he was inclined to think that the blue guest room, which
Victoria had recently had done over at great expense, was too
good for a refugee.</p>
<p>Louisa raised her lashes and studied him with her sympathetic,
amused, and faintly ironic expression.</p>
<p>"It isn't an orphan, Virginius," she answered slowly, while
the lively hazel of her eyes softened and darkened, "though I
confess that would have astonished me less when you consider all
the thousands of them she must have held in her arms. You never,"
she added reproachfully, "did justice to Mary Victoria's
wonderful work with her orphanage."</p>
<p>"If it isn't an orphan, then--well--" He looked at her
imploringly. "It isn't a Russian, Louisa?" For it seemed to him
that, whatever the sex or parentage of Mary Victoria's surprise,
he could bear anything better than its being a Russian.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Virginius." Louisa, who had a masculine sense of
humour, was actually laughing. "What an imagination you have! No,
it isn't any kind of orphan, my dear friend, though I am not sure
that mightn't be better. It is a husband."</p>
<p>"A husband!" As he gasped out the word he felt that the worst
he had expected would have been better than this. "A husband and
a refugee?"</p>
<p>Louisa shook her head. Her manner was as composed as ever, and
it occurred to him resentfully that she was enjoying the
sensation she created. "There isn't but one, and I didn't say he
was a refugee, even a left-over one. No, Mary Victoria might
sympathize with refugees, but she is hardly the kind of girl to
marry one."</p>
<p>"Tell me all." The words were swept out on a sigh of relief.
"Don't break anything to me. Nothing can be so bad as
suspense."</p>
<p>Though he could see that she was disappointed, she was too
human at the core to resist his appeal. "As well as I can
understand she has been interested in this young man for several
years. It was all very confused over the telephone, and you can
imagine what a shock it was to Victoria. But she is quite
positive that Curle said it wasn't a recent affair. It seems they
were married five, or maybe it was four, months ago."</p>
<p>"Four months ago, and she never told us a word of it!"</p>
<p>"I suppose there must have been what seemed to her a good
reason. Anyhow, Curle says he is not at all bad-looking and seems
to have a mind of his own. Mary Victoria met him first, several
years ago, in a hospital. He was, Curle said, in a terrible state
when she found him, though he had not apparently lost his
appearance. Besides, Mary Victoria feels that she saved his
life--and you can understand what that would mean to a
high-minded girl."</p>
<p>"You haven't told me his name." Fear was crawling round his
thoughts like a caterpillar on the edge of a leaf.</p>
<p>"Well, Victoria took that more to heart than anything else. I
mean his coming from Queenborough and our never having heard of
him. However, as I told her, that makes very little difference
to-day when few people can afford to marry into the best families
because they are all so impoverished. Blood is the last thing I'd
think about, and, after all, he is so obscure that he may have
descended from a Colonial governor."</p>
<p>"You haven't told me his name," he repeated, and there was the
rasping sound of suspense in his voice.</p>
<p>"Welding, Martin Welding." She paused to drive it in, and then
added brightly, "I am sure it has a very distinguished sound.
There used to be a family of that name in the Northern Neck, and
even if he doesn't belong to them--well, sound is really more
important to-day than anything else, except, of course, money,
which he doesn't appear to possess."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage breathed with difficulty. Was it possible, he
wondered, collecting his faculties, that he was on the point of
having a stroke? "I don't care about the family," he rejoined
presently. "I don't care about the money--damn it! I beg your
pardon, Louisa, I must have forgotten myself. But--but this is
worse than anything I imagined. Mary Victoria had no right. She
must have known, or at least suspected the truth--"</p>
<p>He broke off and choked back his words, arrested by the
thought that. Louisa was ignorant, unless Victoria had told her,
of poor Milly's disaster. "The truth, Virginius?"</p>
<p>A feeling of prostration, of inexpressible futility, rushed
over him. What an unfair advantage life could take of the young,
of the poor, of the generous in heart! That Mary Victoria, his
own daughter, his noble, earnest, high-minded daughter, so eager
to sacrifice herself in [what now appeared to him as an
inaccurate and abominable phrase], world service--that Mary
Victoria should have been involved in this moral catastrophe!
"That is the young man I asked her to make inquiries about in
Paris," he said thickly. "I know very little about him, but the
little I know I dislike."</p>
<p>"You mean that there is something to his discredit?"</p>
<p>"Decidedly." He felt that mute rage would strangle him.</p>
<p>"I hope it is nothing about a woman," Louisa observed, with a
competent air. "I hate discreditable things in connection with
women."</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Littlepage hesitated; then indignation
triumphed over prudence. "I happen to know that he was--well,
deeply interested in another young woman before he was sent to
France."</p>
<p>"Not a girl we know."</p>
<p>"Well, not a girl you know."</p>
<p>"But a good girl?"</p>
<p>"That depends upon what you mean." There were moments when
Louisa exasperated him.</p>
<p>"I mean a moral one."</p>
<p>"I take that for granted." He hesitated, and then added
firmly, "Yes, she is a good girl."</p>
<p>Though he knew that Louisa had one of the kindest hearts in
the world, he resented her unaffected enjoyment of picturesque
scandal. "I suppose I oughtn't to have told her," his legal
instinct admonished, "but I can't help it if my temper gets the
better of my caution once in a blue moon." Horror had fastened
upon him, and not horror alone, but an anguish of indignation and
pity. He knew now that Victoria was right when she said that his
daughter had been the romance of his life. In his misery he heard
the beating of the rain on the closed windows of the car, and it
seemed to him that it was the sound of an inward desolation which
flooded his soul. Through the November dusk there flashed now and
then, like a sinister warning, the headlights of a car, or the
wet gleam on the rubber coat of a policeman. He had almost
forgotten that Louisa was still beside him when she broke into
his reverie with one of her pointed questions.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that he was engaged to her?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't mean anything less."</p>
<p>As she leaned toward him with an emphatic gesture, her rimless
glasses dropped from her nose and he looked straight into the
unsullied depths of her eyes. "Virginius, this is very serious,"
she said in an urgent voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it is--or it would have been considered so
when I was young."</p>
<p>"At all costs we must keep it from Mary Victoria. After all,
she is my godchild and I feel that I share your
responsibility."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she knows." He didn't mean that, not really, he told
himself, but Louisa's suppressed excitement ruffled his
nerves.</p>
<p>"Not Mary Victoria! Can you imagine her taking a man away from
another woman?"</p>
<p>"No, I cannot. But you must remember that she has spent five
years in Europe. They do things differently in Europe."</p>
<p>Louisa assented brightly as if she enjoyed it. "You can't go
over every summer without discovering that." Holding her glasses
in the tips of her fingers, she firmly replaced them on her nose.
"I feel, however," she continued presently, while she
straightened the platinum chain studded with seed pearls which
she wore attached by a gold safety pin to her bosom, "that Mary
Victoria is superior to any temptation."</p>
<p>With this he was in sympathetic accord. "Yes, she takes after
her mother."</p>
<p>Louisa's face softened and flushed, as it always did when she
spoke of Victoria. Even as children they had been inseparable,
and marriage, which destroys so many earnest friendships, had
only sealed their devotion into an indestructible bond. While
most of Mr. Littlepage's intimate associations with men had
gradually weakened and melted away, it seemed to him at times
that Louisa had been drawn into his marriage and had become a
central part of his placid life with Victoria. Though he had
always admired rather than enjoyed her, he respected her talent
for making herself indispensable in a crisis. At the birth of
every child Louisa had sat all night, without unfastening a
button, near the foot of Victoria's bed, ready, at the nurse's
fateful whisper, to fetch whatever was needed or telephone for
the physician. It was Louisa who had brought him the news of his
first son, and it was Louisa who had murmured to him the
inspiring name "Mary Victoria." She had been near at birth, and
she was nearer still when death had taken, first two of his
children, and then his father, whom he had worshipped, and
Victoria's mother, whom he had esteemed and disliked. It was
impossible to think of his children without remembering the
mornings when, still erect and trim in appearance, Louisa had
poured his coffee, while Victoria looked more virginal than ever
beneath the sky-blue canopy over her bed. It was impossible even
to recall the house of mourning without a grateful memory of
Louisa's capable dealing with funerals. As she grew older, it is
true, her interest in what she called "the new psychology" became
tedious to his imperfect sophistication. "Poor Louisa," he had
once sighed to Victoria. "If she ever falls from virtue how
disappointed she will be to find that there is so little in
it."</p>
<p>The car had reached his door, and Louisa, thrilled by the
secret between them, was urging him to let her go alone to the
station while he remained at home with Victoria. "Victoria needs
you," she reminded him impressively. "There are things that you
ought to talk over together before you see Mary Victoria. After
all," she repeated in a faintly sepulchral tone, "I am her
godmother, and she is almost as dear to me as she is to you."</p>
<p>In the beginning he had resisted; but it was useless to oppose
Louisa when she had definitely made up her mind. "Perhaps you are
right," he admitted at last. "I confess it has been a blow to me.
Maybe I'd better get braced up a bit."</p>
<p>"You are very sensible, Virginius." From her manner no one
would have suspected that the suggestion had come from her. "It
is much better to accustom yourself to the idea before you see
Mary Victoria with her husband. If I go alone to meet them, you
and Victoria will have time to collect yourselves and arrange
your plans. Since you have confided to me what you know of this
young man, I feel more strongly than ever that you should have
time for discussion."</p>
<p>He looked at her keenly. "Is it necessary to tell Victoria
this? I spoke imprudently to you."</p>
<p>She looked hurt but magnanimous. "Not to me, Virginius. You
could not speak imprudently to me." Then, after a thoughtful
pause, she added with gentle sagacity, "No, it is not necessary
to tell Victoria, but it will be natural."</p>
<p>"You mean I can't keep a secret?"</p>
<p>"I mean you can't keep that kind of secret."</p>
<p>"Victoria has high ideals."</p>
<p>"All of us have high ideals, my dear friend. There aren't any
low ones."</p>
<p>Cool, composed, mistress of herself and her destiny, she drove
on and left him gazing after her more in respect than admiration.
Yes, Louisa was a brick; and if like all other bricks, whether
they are composed of baked clay or valiant dust, she was
deficient in charm, he could not, he decided, as he ascended the
baronial steps of his house, imagine a well-regulated world that
existed without her.</p>

<h1><a name="c106" id="c106">VI</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Forty years ago, the Brooke mansion, as it was respectfully
called, embodied all the culture to be derived from a fortune
safely invested in Northern securities. Built by old Silas
Woolley, who had died in the comfort of his shirt-sleeves, the
dwelling had passed to his granddaughter, Victoria Brooke. As a
young husband, Mr. Littlepage had been proud of living in a house
that was pointed out to visitors as "the finest example of
improved Colonial." After all, "improved Colonial" may mean
anything, even Victorian gloom, if one is sufficiently liberal in
one's ideas. Unhappily, the malice of the years, which is so
often diverted by architecture, had subdued the innocent pleasure
with which Virginius had once regarded the imposing façade.
Nothing, however, could impair his respect for the refined taste
and unerring tact of his wife, who appeared to have inherited
only her fortune and her house from her grandfather. "It is
nonsense to pretend that blood is a match for money in the second
generation," Mr. Littlepage mused. "Notwithstanding an ancestor
in the Susan Constant, to say nothing of a Colonial governor and
a British general thrown in, I am raw material when you compare
me with old Silas Woolley's granddaughter."</p>
<p>In the spacious hall, which he never entered without the
feeling that he comprised a whole invading army, he found his
elder son, Duncan, a dark, morose, and inscrutable young man. In
France, where he had served with ardour in the last year of the
war, Duncan had lost not only his health, but all the amiable
pretences which had made life supportable. Even the armistice,
which had left so many relief workers unsatisfied, had come too
late to save him from that singular French decadence which only
the Latin mind is able to find piquant. At thirty, he was as
cynical as Marmaduke, and far more depressing. For Marmaduke's
cynicism, however unwholesome, preserved the Attic salt that
imparts a relish to the stalest philosophy. But, after all,
Marmaduke was past sixty, and at sixty it is possible to
disbelieve in life and love and yet find them amusing. Though
Duncan was as trying in the house as other philosophers, Mr.
Littlepage preferred her nocturnal moods to the morning
brightness of Curle. Even as a baby Curle had annoyed him by his
inordinate zest for living. Nothing, not even his first tooth,
had been able to dampen his spirits; and he had actually appeared
to enjoy teething almost as much as he enjoyed a world war some
twenty-odd years later.</p>
<p>"Have you seen your mother?" Mr. Littlepage inquired with an
anxious frown.</p>
<p>Duncan turned on him a long sallow face, which was
good-looking in a saturnine fashion. "You look as if you'd heard
of Mary Victoria's final reform."</p>
<p>"I am very much distressed, my son."</p>
<p>"What did you expect? We can't have a world war every
day."</p>
<p>"If you take that tone, Duncan, I cannot discuss it."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, sir." There were occasions when Duncan dropped
back, whether from reverence or ridicule his father had never
discovered, into the ceremonial usages of the past. "I was hoping
you would look at it philosophically. After all, as Curle remarks
so accurately, everything might have been worse. It might have
been, considering Mary Victoria's thoroughness, a whole asylum
instead of a husband."</p>
<p>"I cannot understand why she married him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she wanted to make an honest man of him."</p>
<p>"I must repeat, my son, that your tone is offensive."</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, Dad. I didn't mean to be offensive. I
was merely trying to be cheerful."</p>
<p>"You needn't. God knows I get enough of that from Curle."</p>
<p>"Mother had had a little too much of it, I imagine, over the
telephone. Poor Mother! If only she could realise that life isn't
spent either in Heaven or Hell, but in the sultry isthmus of
Purgatory!"</p>
<p>"I am sorry she took the message. Do you know what Curle told
her?"</p>
<p>"She was too agitated to repeat it, but it seems to have been
hopeful enough to depress her."</p>
<p>"Yes, it will go hard with her. She expected so much of Mary
Victoria."</p>
<p>Duncan smiled in derision. "Well, she got a little more than
she expected."</p>
<p>"All of us aren't so cynical, my son. You must remember that
your mother, like most good women, is an idealist. My father used
to say there is only one thing more incorrigible than an
idealist, and that is a predestinarian."</p>
<p>"You'd think the war would have cured anybody, even those who
were so unfortunate as to be left out of it."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage smiled sadly. "Well, you must try to pity
rather than censure the old fogies who still believe that
anything makes a difference. After all, as Marmaduke will tell
you, if there were no ideals there would be nothing left for us
to kill each other about."</p>
<p>"There's no need to tell me. You'd better tell Mother and Aunt
Louisa." The children had been brought up to call Louisa
"aunt."</p>
<p>"Well, we needn't argue about that. What we must do now is to
help your mother bear a great disappointment."</p>
<p>This time it was Duncan who smiled, though he was, as his
father said to himself, in no smiling mood. "It seems to me, sir,
that the one who really needs help is this poor devil of a
husband. Do you know anything of him?"</p>
<p>"Very little, and that little, I am sorry to say, is not to
his credit. But we must try to suspend judgment."</p>
<p>"Well, that sounds encouraging. I didn't know Mary Victoria
had so much human nature."</p>
<p>"Your jesting is in bad taste. Where is your mother?"</p>
<p>"I left her in her bedroom a few minutes ago. Poor Mother! She
would find life so much more livable if she could only give up
being happy."</p>
<p>"She couldn't, Duncan, even if she wanted to. It is more than
her religion, it is her very nature to keep hoping for the best
and trying to make the world better. Think of all she must have
suffered with you in the army, Curle in a training camp, and Mary
Victoria in the Balkans. That must have tried not only her faith
but her cheerfulness."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose that turned her optimism into a nervous habit.
I sometimes think the muscles of her face have never relaxed
since the war."</p>
<p>"You can't blame her for that. It wasn't easy to keep
smiling."</p>
<p>"But why the devil did you have to keep smiling? What is there
so heroic in pretending the world is what it isn't. It's like the
everlasting Holy Rolling of American politics. That's what makes
me sick about Curle."</p>
<p>"Don't be too hard on your brother. The noise he makes may be
only a whistling to keep up his courage."</p>
<p>There was a sneering note in Duncan's rejoinder. "Well, if he
doesn't look out, he will whistle himself into office. He is as
average as a President."</p>
<p>"Curle keeps up with the procession, my son, and we do not.
Even though we may object to his special brand of democracy, we
cannot deny that he is one of the men who are responsible for our
whole march of progress."</p>
<p>Duncan laughed almost naturally. "Yes, I'm ready to admit
that. By the way, Mother doesn't wish us to drink anything more
cheering than grape juice at dinner. She hopes, for the first
night, anyway, until she has had a chance to inform herself about
the habits of Mary Victoria's husband, that you will follow
Curle's example and turn your back when you drink."</p>
<p>A cloud passed without settling over Mr. Littlepage's genial
features. "Well, join me in the library before dinner," he
responded gloomily; and reflected that he could forgive Victoria
all the good she had ever done him if only she would occasionally
appear to be in the wrong.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir, but it seems to me a trifle hard on the poor
devil. All I can hope is that he has been prudent enough to
provide against our habit of reforming everybody but
ourselves."</p>
<p>Turning away, with the uncomfortable sensation that Duncan was
more than a match for him, Mr. Littlepage ascended the wide
staircase and entered the very simple and expensive bedroom he
shared with Victoria. From the portrait of one of his least
prudish ancestresses by Sir Peter Lely, which hung over the Adam
mantelpiece, to the delicate acanthus leaves on the fluted posts
of the twin beds, and the flowered brocade of the Duncan Phyfe
sewing-stand, the room had always impressed him as being, in some
extraordinary fashion, less real than it appeared on the
surface.</p>
<p>When he entered, Victoria, who had slipped into a tea-gown of
violet velvet, turned her cheek for his kiss with her usual
wifely composure. Though she had lost long ago her virginal
loveliness, she had ripened at middle age into a handsome and
fruitful-looking woman. Her complexion was still fine in texture,
but she flushed easily and there were tiny clusters of veins in
her smooth round cheeks. In the last year, after her severe
illness, her brown hair had begun to turn grey in patches, while
her limpid eyes had been ruffled by a look of apprehension--or
was it merely a startled wonder at life? What she had never lost,
what she could never lose, he felt, as long as she remained
herself, was the expression of unselfish goodness that quivered
in an edge of light about her pale full lips and imparted
firmness and nobility to her features.</p>
<p>"I suppose Louisa told you," she began, while she lifted her
arms to fasten a necklace of amethysts. Her hair, which was thick
and soft but without lustre, was piled high on the crown of her
head, after a fashion of the early 'nineties.</p>
<p>"Yes, she told me, but I could scarcely believe my ears," he
answered in a discouraged tone. He saw at once that she had been
weeping, and though, like most other men, he resented tears when
they were shed in earnest, he was touched by the sight of
Victoria's reddened eyelids. "It must have been a shock to you,"
he continued, kissing her again with deeper tenderness but
diminished enthusiasm. "Curle ought to have telephoned me
first."</p>
<p>"He tried to, but you were in that conference. I wish you
could have met them."</p>
<p>"I am not sure that I do. It seems to me just a little too
much."</p>
<p>A sob quivered in Victoria's voice. "I could have believed it
of anybody sooner than of Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"Well, what was her excuse?" he broke out indignantly. "Why
did she do it?"</p>
<p>"We'll never know unless she tells us. In another girl I
should call it an infatuation. But Mary Victoria! Can you imagine
Mary Victoria infatuated?"</p>
<p>"Things happen every day that I cannot imagine."</p>
<p>"Not things like this. Not to girls like Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"Don't you suppose every parent must feel that way?"</p>
<p>"It isn't feeling only, Virginius. Think of Mary Victoria's
record for world service. Think of her independent work in the
Balkans. Think of the way she refused to desert those friendless
orphans after the war."</p>
<p>"Oh, world service!" he groaned, and felt that the syllables
smacked of hypocrisy. "After all, even the best war records do
not make good peace programmes," he continued presently. "And I
prefer, on the whole, not to think of the Balkans."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to imply that Mary Victoria has been unsettled
in--in . . ." The question, which had begun bravely enough,
trailed off to a whisper.</p>
<p>"Well, I shouldn't be too sure of anything to-day, not even of
your own daughter. I don't mean, of course, that her moral
principle has been undermined. It would take more than an idea,
it would take an axe, to undermine Mary Victoria's principles.
Still she has been subjected to long contact with the Balkan
temperament . . ."</p>
<p>"I am positive," Victoria insisted gently, "that no amount of
immorality could shake Mary Victoria's ideals. What disturbs me
is the thought that this young man may have worked upon the
child's noble impulses."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've thought of that." He appeared anxious and
distressed, as indeed he was. "But it seems fairer to suspend
judgment."</p>
<p>At this Victoria beamed upon him with more than wifely
sweetness. "You couldn't be unfair, Virginius, if you tried," she
responded, which was, Mr. Littlepage felt, as much as any husband
has a right to expect. "Yes, it is more charitable to suspend
judgment. And we must remember," she concluded in a brighter
tone, "that whatever his past has been, he will have a wonderful
influence in Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>In the severe discipline of marriage Mr. Littlepage had
cultivated the habit of looking at his wife without seeing her.
It was only in those rare intervals when his evasive idealism was
transfixed by the sharp flash of reality that he perceived how
time--or was it marriage?--had altered his vision. The wonder of
it, he felt, while the actual Victoria stood imprisoned between
the pointed beams of fancy and fact, was that he could ever, even
in the flower of her girlhood, have found her exciting. That he
had fallen in love with her features was less astonishing to-day
than that he was once interested in her opinions. Even now he
could see that she was one of those women who might still be
beautiful if they had less confidence in the fidelity of their
husbands. But her mind, which must have matured with years, could
scarcely have been more interesting at twenty than it was at
fifty. To be sure, he found himself insisting, she had been a
perfect wife to him, and as a husband rather than a human being,
he was still faithful, he was even devoted. Was it merely, he
asked himself, that he had grown older and more settled in
spirit? Yet there were moments in spring and autumn, when he was
still young enough to feel that a thwarted buccaneer ranged in
his soul, while the quiet air about him was charged with the
bloom of the wild grape or the magic of drying vines. And in
these moments, before this frail rapture broke, he would grasp
again the perilous illusion of desire without end.</p>
<p>"I've had the two guest rooms put in order," Victoria was
saying, for her practical mind could always find comfort in the
details of living. "I couldn't bear the idea of putting a strange
man in Mary Victoria's room."</p>
<p>He remembered the care with which she had just had her
daughter's room papered and painted in ivory. Only yesterday she
had shown him the yellow organdie curtains and the sea-blue
glazed chintz for the furniture. After all, it was harder on
Victoria, he told himself, because she had no outside profession
into which she could retreat.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps she is used to him by now," he remarked with
gentle derision. "We are in danger of forgetting that he is her
husband, not ours."</p>
<p>On her dressing-table, in an oval frame of ivory, there was a
miniature of Mary Victoria, which her mother had had painted in
Florence. Crossing the room, he studied the prim little features
and the tight auburn curls gathered back above the delicately
arched eyebrows and fastened by the familiar bow of blue ribbon.
The nose and chin were firm for a child, and the lovely
slate-coloured eyes were too serious for laughter. Yes, it was
impossible to deny that Mary Victoria's character was as
humourless as her war record. "Marmaduke is right," Mr.
Littlepage thought dejectedly, "our lack of genuine gaiety was
proved even before we invented the pompous farce of prohibition.
No civilization with a true sense of humour could afford to take
so seriously the feminine instinct and throw to the winds the gay
masculine devil of compromise."</p>
<p>"This is the hardest blow we've ever had from one of our
children," Victoria was saying. "Even Duncan, with his unsound
views, has never distressed me so much."</p>
<p>"What did Curle say to you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he spoke as if it were a pleasant surprise. You know how
Curle is."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," he assented with weariness. "I asked him how it
had happened, and he said that Mary Victoria had saved this young
man's life. As if that were a sufficient reason for marrying
him."</p>
<p>"It might be for Mary Victoria. Most women seem to feel that
way; but it is unfortunate that there are so many worthless lives
to be saved. It is nothing less than a criminal assault upon the
law of the Survival of the Fittest."</p>
<p>"Don't be flippant, Virginius. It isn't a laughing
matter."</p>
<p>"I was never more serious, my dear."</p>
<p>"Your tone doesn't sound like it. Curle said that Martin
Welding called her his good angel. I suppose he was speaking the
truth."</p>
<p>"No doubt. Gordon Crabbe, you remember, called her that also.
Think how desperately we opposed that marriage; yet God may have
known best if only we had not interfered."</p>
<p>"Even disappointment, Virginius, will not excuse levity.
Besides, that marriage would have taken Mary Victoria to Africa.
Anything, it seems to me, is better than that."</p>
<p>"I am not sure. At least Gordon Crabbe had a fine character
and came of good stock."</p>
<p>"Well, she never cared about family."</p>
<p>"I know. She is like Curle." If he had uttered his entire
thought, he might have added, "After all, what are the Woolleys?"
but it was not for nothing, he reflected, that he had bridled his
inquiring mind in the early days of the Browning class. Moreover,
prudence warned him that no American stock is common enough to be
plebian to its descendants. So he said merely, "Louisa went to
the station."</p>
<p>"I sometimes wonder what we should do without her. She is so
helpful in trouble."</p>
<p>He looked with distrust at the ornamental clock on the
mantelpiece, and then drew out his watch. "They ought to be here
now any minute. If you have nothing more to suggest, I think I'll
brace myself with a highball. Duncan has warned me that there
will be grape juice for dinner. It's a pity that I happen to be
expecting my bootlegger this evening."</p>
<p>"Oh, Virginius, can't you manage to put him off?"</p>
<p>"It isn't easy to catch him, you know. But there isn't the
slightest cause for anxiety. Socially, you must remember, he is
more presentable than a parson. Have you forgotten that he is
both a college graduate and a member of one of the oldest
families in the Tidewater?"</p>
<p>Victoria gazed at him sadly but without reproach. All the more
prominent pillars of the society in which she lived supported the
institution of bootlegging; and custom, which breaks laws and
makes morality, had reconciled her law-abiding instincts to this
ubiquitous lawlessness.</p>
<p>"I must have an opportunity to talk to Mary Victoria. If
drinking should be his weakness, surely you would not wish to
subject him to temptation?"</p>
<p>"Surely not. But in that case we'd be prudent to turn him over
to Marmaduke."</p>
<p>"If only you would treat serious subjects seriously,
Virginius! Of course what I said was merely a surmise.
Only--only--"</p>
<p>"I know, my dear, and after Marmaduke there must be the
deluge. However, this young man isn't expected to live with us,
is he?"</p>
<p>"I hope not, but we must consider Mary Victoria. I can't tell
anything until I have had a long talk with her."</p>
<p>"Then the best thing I can do is to keep out of it." Turning
away with a sigh, he was enveloped immediately, it seemed to him,
in the colourless atmosphere of an existence that he led without
desire, without even volition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c107" id="c107">VII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>With outstretched arms and the smile of an eager but doubtful
lover, Mr. Littlepage watched Mary Victoria float toward him on
the drifts of rain between the two fire-coloured maples. His
first thought was, "She is lovelier than I remember her"; his
second, "And happy! I have never seen her so happy." Had he
really forgotten the direct carriage, the radiant energy of her
figure, the dovelike grace of her small head, with its wings of
bright auburn hair, the tranquil beauty of her grey eyes? As she
melted into his arms, another idea sprang from confusion into
vacancy. "She is her mother all over again, only there's more of
her." More of her not only in height and beauty, but in
character, in determination, and in moral purpose.</p>
<p>"Dear Father!" She kissed him tenderly before she drew away
with a gesture of pride and protection. "This is Martin, my
husband. I wanted to bring him to you as a surprise, but Curle
insisted upon telephoning Mother this morning."</p>
<p>When she passed on to her mother, Mr. Littlepage reluctantly
held out his hand to his son-in-law. Not a bad-looking chap, he
repeated to himself, while he struggled in vain to think of some
phrase that would sound adequate when spoken aloud. To his
dismay, a single rebellious sentence drummed passionately in his
mind, and he heard over and over the question, "Why did you
betray Milly Burden?" Well, he could scarcely, at the very
beginning of their acquaintance, make the single inquiry that he
felt to be of vital significance. Men, he reflected, especially
men who were Southern gentlemen, had long ago agreed to refrain
among themselves from embarrassing questions. Interrogation, like
reproach, was one of the minor perquisites attached to the
otherwise dubious privilege of being a lady. A little later, upon
a more appropriate occasion, the question might proffer itself
uninvited. A little later--but not now, not in this first
glorious hour of Mary Victoria's return. While these thoughts
spun rather than slipped into his mind, he gazed, in a silence
that he tried to make hospitable, at the flat dark hair, the
pallid and somewhat too pointed features, and the burning hazel
eyes of the man whom Mary Victoria had chosen out of a whole
world, or at least a whole continent, of scarcely less desirable
males. Not bad-looking indeed, he assented almost in spite of
himself. Better in appearance anyway than that sanctimonious
fellow, the missionary, who had passed straight from world
service to one of the more exclusive tribes in the Congo. But
there's something wrong, he found himself observing the next
instant, with the startling eyes of this chap. Attractive no
doubt to a woman; but, in the judgment of a father-in-law, they
appeared too bright and inscrutable, as if they had come suddenly
upon something that nobody ought to have seen. Then Martin smiled
at him; and this smile, very slow, very winning, explained, he
felt, the dangerous infatuation of Milly Burden, but not of Mary
Victoria.</p>
<p>"Well, this is a surprise--a surprise indeed," repeated Mr.
Littlepage, with an animation which, he felt, was excessive in
buoyancy. "You must give us a little time before we are expected
to call it a pleasure."</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall never expect that of you, Mr. Littlepage," Martin
replied slowly; and his voice, smoothed down by a foreign accent,
was agreeable in quality.</p>
<p>The pause might have been awkward if Curle had not plunged,
with his sanguine courage, into the break. "Why shouldn't we
decide to take no chances, Father, and call the marriage a
success from the beginning?"</p>
<p>"Where is Louisa?" Mr. Littlepage inquired, glancing over the
mountain of luggage. There was something wanting, he told
himself, in a family crisis that failed to embrace Louisa.</p>
<p>"She stopped on the way. Aren't you going to ask us into the
house?"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, my boy. Come in, come in." Glancing up the
staircase, he saw Mary Victoria and her mother ascending, with
arms interlocked, to the floor above. "Perhaps you'd like to stop
for a moment in my library," he added, as cordially as the
circumstances permitted. "Mary Victoria must want a talk with her
mother."</p>
<p>"And you must want one with me." Well, you could pick no flaw,
Mr. Littlepage admitted, in Martin's attitude. It was reasonable;
it was encouraging; it was even correct. Looking at the young
man, while he sank into one of the soft leather chairs, his
reluctant father-in-law decided that he might have made a
suitable, if not an ideal, husband for Milly Burden. For Milly
Burden, but not for Mary Victoria, who, with her conquering
loveliness and her secure fortune, had every right to demand the
best that nature provided. And, after all, now that he confronted
Martin Welding like an embodied retribution, how could he begin?
What could he say to a son-in-law who had once been the lover and
must remain, in Mr. Littlepage's thoughts, the perpetual seducer
of trusting innocence, or--even if girls were no longer as
innocent as they used to be--of trusting devotion. For he was one
of those unusual men to whom betrayed devotion appears a deeper
wrong than damaged innocence. He was fond of Milly, of course,
and if he had not been fond of her, he should still have felt
that he wanted to tell this attractive rotter with the burning
eyes what he thought of him. Well, youth was not like that in the
'nineties. When he was young, a man thought twice before he
seduced a woman of good family; and Mrs. Burden might be
tiresome, but she came of decent and respectable stock. He had,
it was needless to remind himself sadly, known Southern gentlemen
who were immoral; but they had been immoral, in the teeth of a
severe code of honour, with discrimination. They were held
accountable not only by a proper regard for religion and a true
reverence for pure womanhood, but later, when all these defences
of virtue failed, by the precepts of chivalry and the point of
the pistol. When they wished to misconduct themselves, they had,
with such notorious exceptions as Colonel Bletheram, stepped down
discreetly from their superior station in life; and in the ages
of gallantry, which were undaunted by the perils of
miscegenation, they had stepped down also from their superior
shading in colour. These unpleasant truths, thought Mr. Little
page, who had become resigned to the universe, are the facts of
life that every man discovers and no man discusses. But in those
robust epochs sin was sin, he mused, and not merely an inhibited
pleasure.</p>
<p>His eyes roamed over the background of English calf, of red
morocco, of beautifully tooled bindings, and finally came to
rest, over the mantelpiece, upon the distinguished profiles of
the first Littlepage in Virginia. "Before you go upstairs is
there anything I can do for you?" he inquired as he drew out his
watch. "We dine usually at half-past seven."</p>
<p>The young man brightened into his agreeable smile. "Nothing,
unless you can give me a drink. I feel as if I were giving way
somewhere inside."</p>
<p>For the first time Mr. Littlepage observed that a royal
decanter of old Bourbon still remained on the table. Duncan must
have left it there when he fled at their approach.</p>
<p>"I'll take one with you. Only you must give me your word that
it isn't a habit."</p>
<p>"It used to be, but Mary Victoria doesn't allow habits in
marriage."</p>
<p>While he scrupulously measured out his whisky, Mr. Littlepage
glanced at his son-in-law with a stifled feeling of human--or was
it merely of masculine?--solidarity. "I ought to know," he
thought, without uttering the imprudent confession, "for I
married her mother; and Mary Victoria is her mother all over
again, only more so." Aloud he remarked lightly, "Anyhow, I
promise not to tempt you too often." Holding his own glass to the
light, with a sigh of supreme satisfaction, he reflected that
only in his diminishing stock of Bourbon or Baumgartner could he
still savour the lost bouquet of living.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's safe to tempt me," Martin retorted. "I've already
fallen.</p>
<p>"Not too far to enlighten us, I hope, upon the reason--or at
least the meaning of this surprise."</p>
<p>Again that wistful and slightly ironic smile. "Mary Victoria
can answer that better than I can. I suspect, however, that she
married me because she saved my life and didn't know what else to
do with it. That is the nuisance of saving people's lives. They
are on your hands and you've got to do something about them. I
had the kind of claim upon her she couldn't ignore." After a
barely perceptible pause, he added in a tone that was half tender
and half satirical, "She has been my good angel."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage nodded. "I gathered that much from Curle."</p>
<p>"Well, I think it explains everything that Mary Victoria has
done."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. And now, if you don't mind my putting the question
so soon, what plans have you made for the future?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely none. I've nursed an incurable hope, you know,
that I'd be spared any future." Having emptied his glass, he put
it down and remarked with a laugh that reminded Mr. Littlepage of
his elder and least successful son, "At the moment, however,
fortified by this incomparable Bourbon, I am reconciled to the
present."</p>
<p>"Am I to understand that you are making no effort to earn a
livelihood?"</p>
<p>"It isn't as bad as that. I suppose I'll have to find
something to do. I used to work, you see, but this damnable war
stopped me. When they told me I was needed for killing, of course
work had to go overboard."</p>
<p>An ominous frown gathered upon Mr. Littlepage's benign
forehead. Not only did the Great War now occupy a position
scarcely less honourable than the pedestal upon which he had
placed the war for the Confederacy, but he was naturally
suspicious of a husband who was not at the same time a
conscientious provider. "What kind of work were you doing?" he
asked in a more reserved tone of voice.</p>
<p>"In the beginning it was crockery, but after that I went into
a bank. Crockery paid better, but the bank left me more time for
writing. You see, I have always wanted to write."</p>
<p>Though the candour of the young man was disarming, it seemed
incredible to Mr. Littlepage that Mary Victoria could have
stooped to the obscure, if blameless, business of crockery. And
worse even than the business of crockery, which, though inelegant
in sound, retained its decent status in society, was the
confession that his daughter's husband had been seriously "trying
to write." For Mr. Littlepage was an ornament of that exclusive
sphere in which literature, like sin, is respected only when it
enlivens the worm-eaten pages of history.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't imagine there's much in that," he observed, and
inquired immediately, "By the way, what first took you into the
crockery business?"</p>
<p>"I had an uncle who kept a store on Broad Street. It seemed
the easiest way to keep from starving while I learned to write.
Then I went into the Metropolitan Bank. I was doing better with
my writing when the war came. After it was over they put me in a
hospital for a while, and as soon as I was out and free again, I
went back to France. That was where I finally broke down and Mary
Victoria found me in time to save my life."</p>
<p>This, even if one failed to consider the ironic tone, was far
from what the most generous father-in-law could call promising.
More and more, as the conversation followed its deplorable
course, Mr. Littlepage wondered if Victoria would be able to take
a cheerful view of the bare prospect. "You don't imagine, do you,
that crockery and writing together would be sufficient to provide
for a girl like Mary Victoria?"</p>
<p>Martin shook his head, and it occurred to Mr. Littlepage that
he had never entirely collected his faculties since the surprise
of his marriage. "Well, you see, Mary Victoria seemed to think we
needn't worry. She didn't like the crockery business; but she had
some idea of speaking to her cousin Daniel Woolley. He is
president of a bank, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"And you think you're fitted for that kind of work?"</p>
<p>"I didn't think so even when I was doing it. But Mary Victoria
has settled it in her mind. She has been, as I told you, my good
angel, and I have a dread of disappointing her."</p>
<p>"I know," Mr. Littlepage assented. "But you must remember that
Mary Victoria is an idealist. It is in the nature of an idealist
to expect a great deal of other people."</p>
<p>Martin sighed, while his thin, pale hand groped nervously
toward the decanter and drew back without touching it. "That
makes it all the worse to be obliged to disappoint her. She feels
things so deeply. And do you know," he concluded, with a rush of
confidence that the older man found both imprudent and appealing,
"I have a fear of not measuring up to her standard. I know, of
course, that I'm not half as big as I look to her. She insists on
seeing me not as the utterly inadequate fellow I am in reality,
but as a kind of fallen archangel. It isn't my fault, though
nobody, least of all her father, will ever believe it. I never
even in the beginning, tried wilfully to deceive her. I've told
her again and again that I am not worth half that she has done
for me. But it isn't any use telling her. She is still convinced
that she is right and I am wrong in my estimate."</p>
<p>All this was imprudent, reflected Mr. Littlepage; but it was
as familiar and almost as stale as a sermon. For Victoria also
had had her aspirations. No sooner had she fallen in love than
she had tried, though with the gentlest touch imaginable, to make
him into the sort of man he had never been and never could hope
to become. He had suffered the painful process of being moulded
into an ideal, as well as the far sharper pang of realizing the
disappointment that must have attended her efforts. Too sincere
for dissimulation, too magnanimous for resentment, Victoria had
steadfastly ignored her failure, and had persevered, with
unaltered sweetness, in the pretence that Virginius and marriage
and human nature in general were all exactly what she wished them
to be. "As noble as she is herself," Mr. Littlepage thought with
tenderness. For never, since that memorable evening in the
Browning class, had he felt the faintest disposition to deny that
Victoria was noble in character. Her goodness, so far from being
academic or acquired, was as natural as her simple faith in the
perfectibility of husbands. All her life she had diffused love as
other persons diffuse selfishness; and even in those frequent
moments when he had felt that the sweetness of marriage cloyed
his spirit, he had never forgotten that he owed more to her
generosity than he could ever repay. Watching Martin's way with
the decanter, Mr. Littlepage told himself disconsolately that
only the substance was different, not the situation. To his
veracious mind, which prided itself, however inaccurately, upon
facing the facts of life, it was evident that Victoria had had
more plastic material to work upon than the character of this
inadequate young man afforded. Yet, with this finer clay and
ampler measure to her hand, all that Victoria had achieved was
the pattern of a contented citizen and a successful attorney.
Beyond this, he could discern no more exalted stature than that
of a presentable member of Queenborough society, in which the
custom of dining out with a limited number of one's least
interesting acquaintances moved in a monotonous circle from
October to June. Into this circle, which grew duller as time and
tide encrusted the conversational platitudes, there entered
occasionally a new member, whose prerogative of wealth only those
too poor to profit by it had ever disputed. Yet the only person
who might have irradiated the lustre of pleasure, for him at
least, had long ago ceased to appear in the sluggish air of these
gatherings. Not that Mrs. Dalrymple was excluded by her station
in life from what was now an affluent and had been once an
aristocratic society. Even her fall, had it been as ladylike as
poor Aunt Agatha's, might have been forgotten by everybody except
a few crystallized virgins and old Colonel Bletheram. But her
imprudent behaviour in the divorce court, combined with the
well-founded suspicion that she had committed other pleasures
abroad, had debarred her, in the opinion of the best judges, from
the privileges to which she was entitled by birth. Regrettable.
Almost deplorable. For in the stiff and slightly pompous dignity
of his middle years, only the ardent memory of Amy Dalrymple had
fanned to life the flickering embers of youth. Nothing since his
first love affair, not material prosperity, not communion beneath
the stained-glass memorial windows in Saint Luke's Episcopal
Church, not even the contagious idealism with which armies are
mobilized, had ever exalted him to this starry altitude of the
spirit. While the echo of this lost but unforgotten ecstasy awoke
in his mind, he asked in a tone of sympathy rather than
rebuke:</p>
<p>"May I inquire, without seeming impertinent, where your
education began?"</p>
<p>"Exactly where it ended, in a public school. If you ever
attended one, you know that the word 'education' is a euphemism
of modern democracy. But I got a good deal out of books. I think
I may say I got as much as any man could out of books."</p>
<p>Again Mr. Littlepage frowned while he studied his son-in-law.
The reply, he told himself, left much to be desired; for
literature as a pursuit was even less profitable, and scarcely
more distinguished, than crockery as a business. The young man's
tone, with its curling irony at the end of a sentence, reminded
him of the disreputable way Marmaduke talked in his attic, and he
sighed to think that Mary Victoria might have introduced a second
artist into the family.</p>
<p>"Well, I shouldn't put too much faith in literature, if I were
you," he said presently. "Without posing as an authority, I may
express the opinion that there isn't much material in Virginia
history that hasn't been already exhausted."</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, and in the flatness of this
silence, Mr. Littlepage had a queer sensation that Martin was
smiling within. Then, with an air of incredible patience, the
young man answered slowly, as if he were speaking to a foreigner
in words of one syllable. "But historical novels are all tosh,
you know. I am interested in life, not in costume and scenery. I
want to get at grips with reality."</p>
<p>"Well, I shouldn't build my hopes on that kind of stuff," Mr.
Littlepage remarked mildly but firmly; for the word "reality"
startled him whenever it was divorced from philosophy and dragged
into literature. In that uncomfortable moment, he was visited by
the fear lest Mary Victoria's husband should be afflicted with
Marmaduke's foreign taste for indecent psychology. Then
remembering that he himself had acquired, since the Great War, a
cosmopolitan attitude towards Mrs. Dalrymple, he observed simply,
"I'm afraid there isn't much to be got out of literature as a
profession."</p>
<p>"Not in Queenborough. Why, you haven't even a library, yet you
people pretend to be civilized."</p>
<p>For the first time Mr. Littlepage allowed his exasperation to
ooze into his tone. It annoyed him profoundly that this young man
of ignoble antecedents should belittle the ancient and honourable
culture of Queenborough. All the learning required to make a
Southern gentleman was comprised, as every Littlepage knew
without being told, in the calf-bound rows of classic authors and
the Prayer-Book of the Protestant Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>"Those of us who have leisure to read are able to provide our
own libraries," he rejoined, with dignity. "Or if we are too
impoverished for that, we may always borrow with credit from our
friends who are better off." Glancing up at the volumes he had
inherited from his father, he congratulated himself upon the ease
with which his declaration had been justified by his
surroundings.</p>
<p>"Yes, I see, of course. But you must remember that I could
neither buy nor borrow when I lived here. However, I shan't be
able to do much reading until I have proved to Mary Victoria that
you can make your way in the world without being a mutton head.
Do you know, by the way, what has become of her?"</p>
<p>While he looked at his son-in-law, Mr. Littlepage's liquid
brown eyes became opaque with a frozen reserve. "She went
upstairs with her mother. They have probably stopped to speak to
poor Aunt Agatha."</p>
<p>"Poor Aunt Agatha? Is she an invalid?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no. That's merely a habit that we fell into a generation
ago. Her life was wrecked in early youth by an unfortunate love
affair from which she never recovered."</p>
<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Martin Welding, while a startled horror
swept over his thin face. "I remember now. Mary Victoria told me
about her."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c108" id="c108">VIII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"What were your impressions, my dear?" inquired Mr.
Littlepage, in modest blue and white pyjamas, of Mrs. Littlepage,
in a prim nightgown of white nainsook beneath a lavender flannel
wrapper. Around them, the familiar estate of marriage was
preserved in the unruffled calm of their bedroom as in an
embalming fluid. Against the rear wall, the twin beds with fluted
columns were neatly turned down to the exact margin of
embroidered linen sheets and fleecy satin-bordered blankets. On
Mr. Littlepage's right side, a small Heppelwhite table held a
sky-blue tray bearing a thermos bottle, a glass, a box of cough
drops, and one of Mr. Strachey's disrespectful biographies bound
in a subdued colour. Beside Mrs. Littlepage, the companion table
bore a lavender tray and thermos bottle, a glass, a tube of
veronal, and a well-worn Bible, which opened with a book marker
of purple satin, and contained, in addition to the inspired
print, a heterogeneous collection of pressed flowers and poems
culled from newspapers. Though Mr. and Mrs. Littlepage were so
opposite in character and disposition, they had achieved, in
thirty-one years of effortless living, an indissoluble union of
habit. And it was in obedience to this fast nuptial tie that Mr.
Littlepage, standing beside his downy twin bed, asked this
pregnant question of his wife, who lingered before her mahogany
dressing-table, with her soft ashen brown hair brushed severely
back from her forehead and a film of camphor ice over her smiling
lips. Victoria was not a plain woman, and she might have been
very pretty still. But she had either failed to employ or too
soon relinquished all the arts invented by those women who, from
an urgency of temperament or a pressure of economy, are dependent
upon the uncertain favour of men. There had been moments in their
earlier years when he had wondered if her mildness could be
merely the outward expression of an indifference too passive to
be resentful in nature. As they grew older, and especially since
his frustrated affair with Mrs. Dalrymple, he had accepted
Victoria's sweetness of disposition as gratefully as he enjoyed
clement weather in autumn. It was in this thankful spirit that he
now repeated suavely. "Well, what were your impressions, my
dear?"</p>
<p>Pausing to rub the film of camphor ice into the firm but
pleasant line of her mouth, Victoria cast an anxious glance about
the large close room, which was as open and as unventilated as
marriage. "I confess that I cannot understand Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage sighed in agreement. "I wonder if she really
understands herself. Everything must look different since she
came back to America."</p>
<p>"Yes, I haven't a doubt that she is already beginning to ask
herself why she married so suddenly."</p>
<p>"Then you share my--well, not altogether favourable
opinion?"</p>
<p>For an instant, while Victoria gave her mind to the problem,
her attractive features wore the look of a resigned yet wondering
Madonna. "I cannot see that there is a single point of contact
between them," she said presently.</p>
<p>"They seem to be still in love with each other. Being in love
does establish some kind of congeniality, I suppose. But I agree
with you that he isn't worthy of Mary Victoria. He is a
good-looking chap in his way; but his manners are as ordinary as
Curle's, and bad manners have a way of outlasting good
looks."</p>
<p>"That was why Mary Victoria never took her eyes off him,"
Victoria remarked sadly. "She was nervous, I could see, lest he
should make a wrong impression the first evening."</p>
<p>"That worried me too," Mr. Littlepage rejoined irritably. "If
she keeps it up, she will end by making him afraid to open his
mouth. Couldn't you advise her, very delicately of course, to
leave him a little more at liberty to make mistakes?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage shook her head. "Poor child, she is trying her
best to help him. Did you notice how lovely her face was when she
watched him?"</p>
<p>Yes, he had observed this, and it had reminded him of
Victoria's tender and protective way with the poets. Her manner
of reciting Browning, as if she were trying so patiently to bring
out the best in him, had been the attitude, in an earlier
fashion, of Mary Victoria toward her husband. "It is obvious that
she is in love with him," he admitted, while his expression
hardened, and he remembered that he had failed in his promise to
see Milly that evening. Well, fortunately to-morrow was Sunday,
and Sunday appeared to be the day appointed by Providence for
unwelcome arrivals. "She may, of course, if it is not too late,"
he added grimly, "be able to make something of him."</p>
<p>"It will be his own fault if she doesn't. No man could ask for
a finer influence."</p>
<p>"Except myself," Mr. Littlepage remarked with a smile. "But
that, you know, is exactly what makes me uneasy. All men do not
react in the same manner to an influence. They are not all
blessed with my aptitude for perfectibility."</p>
<p>Victoria responded to this with a sigh. "Few men are like you,
Virginius. But there was a time," she added regretfully, "when
you would not have spoken flippantly of my influence in your
life."</p>
<p>"I did not mean to speak flippantly, my dear. Whatever I am
to-day, I may say honestly, is owing to your example more than to
anything else." While Victoria brightened visibly, he proceeded
with less assurance. "Only it crossed my mind that it really
takes two to make an influence. Fortunately, I came to your hand
at the right moment and in exactly the right mood for your
experiment. The very air was thick with idealism in the
'nineties; but the moral hysteria of the war has degenerated now
into a sort of bleak realism. Mary Victoria lacks one of the
chief accessories to feminine influence, and that is a benign
moisture in the atmosphere."</p>
<p>"I did not think of it as an experiment when we were married,
Virginius, nor did you, I am sure."</p>
<p>"You are right, my dear. I thought of happiness, not of
improvement."</p>
<p>"I shall never forget," Victoria murmured in her softest tone,
"what your father said to me on the day of our wedding. 'Thank
God, Victoria, that my son is marrying a true woman; for pure
womanhood is the only thing that stands between man and the
jungle.'"</p>
<p>Yes, he recognized the Georgian flavour of that phrase; and
now, with the relentless veracity of the modern mind, he could
ask himself if Marmaduke had been right when he said that
hypocrisy was the only art that had reached its peak in America?
For, like most professions of faith, his father's panegyrics had
been addressed to an invisible power; and when, as occasionally
happened, his wife interposed, she had assumed the eternal
outline and the shimmering substance of an allegorical virtue. As
a child, the little Virginius had been deeply impressed by the
dramatic interludes in their family life. The nights when he had
lain awake to listen for his father's stumbling footsteps had
been followed, as naturally as darkness flows into dawn, by the
days when he was obliged to bring tribal offerings of flowers and
fruit to his mother. From the moment of his father's return there
had floated through the open door of the nursery (for his mother
was one of those women who civilize the emotion of love but not
the maternal instinct) the dreary monotone of abject apology.
Even at that tender age he had discovered that one very special
branch of sin is able to assume at will all the transports of
religious conversion. Why was it, for instance, he had once
inquired of his grandmother, that his father became more devout,
and apparently more affectionate, to his mother whenever he was
accused of drinking or loving too freely on unlawful premises?
"Lip-homage," poohpoohed his grandmother, an old lady of
rock-ribbed constitution, who knew her world. Yet the boy had
already begun to suspect that this idolatrous lip-homage
recompensed his mother, in a measure at least, for the
infidelities which had become an important part of the ritual.
Though her forgiveness had seldom failed to wait upon sin, it was
in the midst of these spiritual excesses that she had scattered
her snowy landscapes and strewn her sprays of wild roses over the
mirrors and sofa pillows. And observing, as he grew older, that
art becomes the vehicle of unhappiness almost as frequently as it
becomes the medium of indecency, he had been prepared for the
promptness with which Marmaduke's thwarted desire for Louisa had
oozed through his paint brush into fantastic forms of the nude.
Well, he was obliged to admit that the nude was less
reprehensible to-day, though it was certainly redder than it had
been in the 'nineties. Moreover, the present age, with its
liberal views of sin, had softened Mr. Littlepage's judgment not
only of Marmaduke's pictures, but even of poor Aunt Agatha's
past.</p>
<p>With this thought in his mind, he remarked tolerantly, "Did
you notice that this young man was particularly courteous to Aunt
Agatha?"</p>
<p>Yes, Victoria had observed it, and she was of the opinion that
such politeness spoke well for their son-in-law. "So few young
men pay any attention to old ladies," she said. "That is one nice
thing about Duncan. No wonder he is poor Aunt Agatha's
favourite."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage pondered this idea. "Am I mistaken or is Aunt
Agatha really beginning to take a new interest in life?"</p>
<p>Victoria nodded. "The war did a great deal for her,
Virginius," she answered in a sympathetic tone; for her kind
heart had never been reconciled to the harshness with which the
canon of refined conduct had dealt with poor Aunt Agatha. Such
measures, she had been told as a bride, were necessary to
safeguard divine institutions and preserve the jewel of chastity
from the roving instincts of man; but this explanation, though
she accepted it with docility, seemed to her far from convincing.
Thirty-one years ago, when she first learned of the fate of poor
Aunt Agatha, she had had her doubts in the matter; and since
then, especially as loose conduct became more general and less
conspicuous, her doubts had multiplied and finally settled into
an incurable suspicion of the Victorian ideal. "She has been a
different woman," she added, "ever since she was needed to make
pyjamas."</p>
<p>"I am glad of that," Mr. Littlepage responded, and he
continued after a pause, "I have always felt that the world was a
little too hard upon poor Aunt Agatha. After all, she was very
young, and I remember that my grandmother never concurred in the
opinion that she was of an abnormal nature."</p>
<p>"But the doctors all thought so. Your mother told me, I
remember, that the doctors said she was one of those unfortunate
women who needed a man in her life. They never left her alone
with a man after that or let her go out by herself. What I always
thought, though of course I could not say so aloud, was that it
was simply a disastrous passion for Colonel Bletheram. I have
never," she added, with indignation, "been able to shake hands
with old Colonel Bletheram, though he has had three wives since
he ruined poor Aunt Agatha."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage flushed darkly. "Yes, it was all very sad, and
I admire you for your spirit. If other women were like you, poor
Aunt Agatha's life might have been different. But everyone at the
time appeared to think that it was noble of her to shield her
seducer. They seemed to feel that she was merely obeying some
unwritten etiquette of seduction, and Aunt Agatha had always been
a model of deportment. It is little short of astonishing the way
manners and even morals can alter."</p>
<p>Injustice had never failed to ruffle the limpid shallows of
Victoria's mind; and her long resentment had at last convinced
Virginius that chivalry had fallen short in this particular
instance. To be sure, his mother and his grandmother, conforming
to the arrested psychology of tradition, had accepted the belief
that nature assigned the passion, as well as the pleasure, of
love to the masculine sex. In his childhood no one, not even his
grandmother, had ever disputed this theory; and the whole
feminine world of the 'seventies had connived at the practice of
explaining away a moral infirmity. By some subtle process,
whenever the desperate passion of love visited the curving bosom
of a Southern lady, desire was transformed into a mental
affliction. How many cheerful family physicians of the old
school, Mr. Littlepage now wondered, had encouraged this moral,
if melancholy, hypothesis? How inevitably the pressure of
tradition had changed Aunt Agatha from a spirited girl into an
elderly Magdalen, as vague and unsubstantial as legend. "It was a
cruel age, but all ages are cruel," he meditated, "and all ages
call their own cruelties civilization. The singular part of it
was that women embraced their martyrdom more firmly even than men
inflicted it."</p>
<p>Yes, it was useless to deny that poor Aunt Agatha had fallen
like a perfect lady. No persuasion, no threats, not even the
sinister one of an asylum, had compelled her to divulge the name
of her seducer. Only inference and analogy had attributed her
ruin to dashing Colonel Bletheram, who had imprudently set an
example of gallantry. While poor Aunt Agatha immured herself for
more than forty years in a third-story back bedroom, and flitted
down, like a wistful apparition, to family meals when there were
no important guests, Colonel Bletheram had lost three faithful
wives, but never missed a Christmas cotillion.</p>
<p>"She seems to be taking a great deal of interest in moving
pictures," Mr. Littlepage remarked aloud.</p>
<p>"Aunt Agatha? Yes, she never misses a new one. Moving pictures
and banana sundaes are her only pleasures in life. I encourage
the pictures; but I am very much afraid she will ruin her
digestion with those dreadful mixtures. It seems a pity, too,
that she always selects films with the most sensational titles.
To-day it is 'Passion in the Purple' and yesterday it was 'A
Scarlet Sin.' I wouldn't for the world say anything to dampen her
spirit; but I sometimes think it would be more dignified if she
could interest herself in a charity. I tried to make her do a
little work for our refuge; but she appears to have taken a
dislike to those unfortunate girls."</p>
<p>Victoria, who was endowed with a gentle aptitude for
uplifting, had been for years the president of the Home for
Unfortunates (named after the "Bridge of Sighs" by her
mother-in-law, who was one of the founders). Assisted by the
indefatigable Louisa and a few earnest philanthropists, she spent
her Thursday and Saturday afternoons patiently extracting the
honey from wingless daughters of joy. Though her enthusiasm for
this charity, and indeed for all charities, had decreased since
her severe illness last winter, she still conformed punctiliously
to her old moral observances. Virginius, who had noticed her
waning fervour, asked himself now if Victoria could really have
become as indifferent to the higher life as she appeared? Some
imponderable force (he could only feel, he could not define, the
loss) was slowly diminishing. It is true that she used the same
forms, she employed the same platitudes; but the sound of them
reminded him of husks in which the seeds were beginning to
rattle. There was comfort, however, in the thought that her
sweetness of nature was still inexhaustible. After all, he had
been disappointed in her temperament, not in her character, and
as nineteenth-century moralists had conclusively proved, the
forces of character are more than a match for the follies of
temperament.</p>
<p>"Well, you can hardly blame her, my dear, if, after her
experience, she prefers a sensation to a reform. At her age, I
suppose, she is safe from demoralization."</p>
<p>"I am glad you feel that way, Virginius. Of course, I
understand poor Aunt Agatha's recoil, but Louisa seemed to think
that people may criticize." As her gentle voice trailed into
silence, it occurred to him that her secret wisdom, though still
patient and uncomplaining, had grown a little weary from
contending with indestructible facts.</p>
<p>"Criticize? Good God!" he exclaimed resentfully. "Do you think
by this time that she could feel any criticism more immaterial
than a brick?" Then, dismissing the subject with a gesture of
disgust, he remarked abruptly, "I am sorry that Mary Victoria
married a man she feels obliged to make over."</p>
<p>Victoria assented. "But she is so much better prepared than
most women to bring out the best in a man."</p>
<p>"That, my dear, is what makes me anxious. I am not sure that
her experience in the Balkans has been the safest preparation for
marriage. Nothing, not even moonshine, goes to the head quicker
than saving democracy with other people's money. I am not sure
that the war didn't turn as many heads as it crippled heels.
However, to be practical, I do not envy Mary Victoria the job she
has on her hands. I've more than an inkling of trouble ahead,
and, unless I am mistaken, this young Martin will bear a good
deal of improving."</p>
<p>"Have you heard anything else, Virginius, to his
discredit?"</p>
<p>"It isn't what I've heard, my dear; it is what I know. What
does Mary Victoria say?"</p>
<p>"Very little. She seems radiantly happy, and I believe she
fell in love with him because she feels that she saved his
life."</p>
<p>"I remember now that young Welding used that same expression.
What do they mean when they say she saved his life?"</p>
<p>"Didn't he tell you?"</p>
<p>"Too vaguely for me to understand what it is all about. Wasn't
he included in her general scheme of salvation?"</p>
<p>"Please try not to be flippant, Virginius."</p>
<p>"I was never less flippant, Victoria. Nor more disgusted. Then
his, I gather, was a special act of redemption."</p>
<p>"Please, Virginius--if you will not interrupt. It seems he had
a complete nervous collapse after he found that his work was a
failure. Of course, Mary Victoria would not wish us to speak of
it, except to Louisa, but he was in a state of acute melancholia,
and on the verge of suicide when she came into his life. That is
why he calls her his good angel. I gather that she helped him in
every way, even financially, until he was on his feet and out of
the hospital. Then she got him this position as secretary in her
orphanage; and she says that he did very well. He has quite a
gift for writing, you know."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned. "I've warned him not to build his
hopes on that kind of thing. He'd better look for a practical
job." The more he heard of Mary Victoria's husband, Virginius
decided, the less he admired him. Moreover, he was beginning to
suspect that in love at least Martin Welding was disposed to be
what philosophers have called a pluralist; and from pluralism in
love he recoiled almost as sharply as from polytheism in
religion.</p>
<p>"Mary Victoria feels that very strongly. I have promised her
to ask Daniel if he will take him into the bank. Martin, I gather
from what she said, wished to stay in Paris and do his writing
where living is cheaper and more interesting; but after they were
married Mary Victoria felt it was her duty to return to America.
Her chief interest now, after Martin, of course, is the outlawing
of war--"</p>
<p>"Well, considering all she owes to the last one--"</p>
<p>"Owes to it, dear?"</p>
<p>"I mean not only a husband, for he seems to me to be a
featherweight in the scale, but all the extravagance and
excitement she and so many other women were able to indulge
in."</p>
<p>Victoria stared at him. "I sometimes wonder, Virginius, where
you get your ideas. I am sure there is nothing in your blood to
make you a cynic. Nobody could have had higher ideals than your
father," she continued wearily, as if she were repeating a
ritual, "or a more child-like faith in religion. In the last
conversation I had with him, he told me that he was securely
anchored to every letter in the Bible. If he began to doubt that
the fish swallowed Jonah, he said, it would make him an
infidel."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage remembered the words; and he recalled also
that, with the natural agility so often displayed by the male in
appealing from example to precept, his father had seldom failed
to invoke the ancestral creed in a moral emergency. "Even if he
has lived loosely," Virginius had once overheard his mother
remark by way of apology, "it is a comfort to feel that Marmaduke
has never lost his hold on the truths of religion."</p>
<p>"Well, life must have been easier for a believing generation,"
he replied, with a levity that astonished him. "It is fortunate
that my dear old father passed away while the world was standing
still in its orbit. The gift of self-deception has become a lost
art."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose faith is more difficult than it used to be,"
Victoria sighed, whether in regret or relief it was impossible to
tell from her voice. "That is why Mary Victoria thinks it is
woman's mission to hand on the torch."</p>
<p>"The torch? Have they begun already to preach female
incendiarism?"</p>
<p>"She means, of course, the belief in the ideal. I suppose it
is natural for her to feel, after the inspiration she was in the
Red Cross, that there is no end to her influence for good. She is
so confident that it is difficult not to catch fire, or at least
warmth, from her earnestness. She takes everything, even that old
entanglement of Martin's, in the most forgiving and beautiful
spirit."</p>
<p>"Entanglement?" There was the faintest quiver of fear in the
word.</p>
<p>"Surely, Virginius, you know that other woman?"</p>
<p>"Only one? There may have been a round dozen from all I've
heard of him." After all, had he destroyed Milly's happiness when
he tried to protect her? Would it have been better, as well as
wiser, if he had told the complete truth instead of a poetic
version of facts? "The hardest thing I ever had to do in my
life," he continued indignantly, "is to receive this--this
unspeakable cad into the family."</p>
<p>"Mary Victoria says that she tried with all her power to make
him go back to the other woman."</p>
<p>"Did she go so far, I wonder, as paying for his passage?"</p>
<p>"Virginius, I never knew you to be so bitter. After all, you
were the one who started her on the search for him."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is why I am bitter. I wanted her to find him for
Milly."</p>
<p>"You never told me," Victoria said gently, "but of course I
knew, and I even tried to warn Mary Victoria against him. I
believe that she really did try to make him go back after he was
well, but by that time he was head over heels in love with her. I
don't know exactly what he told her about the affair; but a man
in love can seldom be trusted."</p>
<p>"Well, it seems to me, my dear, that a woman in reform can be
trusted even less. It is always a blow to discover how little
honour there is in the best feminine motives."</p>
<p>"Oh, Virginius, you don't mean that about Mary Victoria? It
hasn't been a month since you told me that, even if other women
stooped to deception, you knew that Mary Victoria was the soul of
honour."</p>
<p>A sound between a laugh and a groan broke from Mr. Littlepage.
"I thought that a month ago, which only proves what a fool a
father can be. Naturally," he added grimly, "I have no intention
of giving my daughter away. We shall have to stand by her."</p>
<p>"What else in the world could we do? Of course, I am deeply
distressed that the other woman is the girl we helped through her
trouble. That makes it more painful for you and far more
humiliating for Mary Victoria. But, after all, we must think
first of our child."</p>
<p>"That is human, no doubt, but it seems to me grossly
unfair."</p>
<p>"I can understand how you feel, dear. It is harder on you than
it is on anyone else. For it isn't as if you had a choice in the
matter."</p>
<p>"Do you honestly think that I haven't?"</p>
<p>"Why, how could you have, Virginius? Are there any
circumstances on earth that would justify our spoiling Mary
Victoria's happiness?"</p>
<p>"No, I dare say you're right. But if Mary Victoria has found
the slightest excuse for herself, I should like to hear what it
is."</p>
<p>For a moment Victoria pondered her answer. Then, in her
softest voice, she replied slowly, "She said that she could tell
from the very beginning that the other girl had made the wrong
sort of appeal to him. Then, when Mary Victoria got to know him
better, and I suppose after they had fallen a little in love, she
discovered that his mother had died when he was a baby and he had
never come under the influence of a really good woman. Later on,
after she had done so much for him, she became convinced that it
was her duty to--to--"</p>
<p>"To perfect him, I suppose--"</p>
<p>"Of course, I agree with you that she might not have felt the
necessity had he been less attractive. Didn't you find him
attractive?"</p>
<p>"Not disturbingly so, but then, you see, I am neither an act
of God nor an instrument of salvation."</p>
<p>"There are times, Virginius, when you sound almost like
Marmaduke."</p>
<p>"I am sorry. There are few Southern gentlemen I should not
prefer to resemble."</p>
<p>"I don't mean in behaviour. No two men in the world could be
more unlike in behaviour." She hesitated an instant, and then
finished magnanimously, "I can never be thankful enough that I
married a man who did not have that other side to his
nature."</p>
<p>"I appreciate that, my dear, and now, if you are ready for
bed, I will open the window."</p>
<p>Slipping into his dressing-gown, and tying the cord securely
in the middle of his rotund waist, he stood watching Victoria,
with mild astonishment, while she stepped out of her felt
slippers, placed her lavender flannel wrapper at the foot of the
bed, and stretched her unconfined body, in the nainsook
night-gown, between the fleecy blankets and embroidered sheets.
Was it for this, echoed a derisive voice in the hollowness of his
mind, that the arboreal imagination of man had climbed down from
the feathery tree-tops?</p>
<p>Turning away, he crossed the grey velvet carpet, and after
raising the window, leaned out into the silence that had fallen
between a retreating and an advancing storm. Overhead, beneath a
closed sky, there was the fluttering of shredded mist; but toward
the south and west a low range of clouds shone silver-black
beneath the pale lustre of moonlight. Poised between the eternal
illusions of time and space, the world appeared to hang suspended
in the midst of an encompassing desolation. And out of this
desolation it seemed to him that a burden of futility poured like
a shower of ashes into his soul. "What is the meaning of it all?"
he asked himself despondently. "Where is it leading? What else is
left in life after you have had happiness?"</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, as if in answer to his meaningless question, a
single fiery star shone in Mrs. Dalrymple's window on the
opposite corner. "So she is still there," he thought, with
scarcely a flicker of longing. "I wonder if she is happy at
last."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The next afternoon Mr. Littlepage, who disliked walking as
much as other successful men, picked his way in the direction of
Juniper Hill, where his brother Marmaduke occupied Mrs. Burden's
third floor. Not only had walking appeared to him, on this
occasion at least, the only means of avoiding helpful advice; but
he was moved by the suspicion that persons of dubious reputation,
such as Marmaduke and Milly Burden, were in the habit of putting
a correct value upon privacy. Though he doubted the wisdom of
seeing Milly so soon after Mary Victoria's triumphant return, it
occurred to him that Marmaduke, from his long experience with
women who were conspicuous for kind hearts rather than for
character, might be the messenger appointed by destiny to break
the news of Martin's desertion. After all, the sooner she
relinquished the hope of him, the happier Milly would be in the
present and the more useful, no doubt, she would become in the
future.</p>
<p>Threading his way through noisy streams of children, he passed
rows of dilapidated houses, until at last the odours of boiled
cabbage and decaying fruits were dispelled by the lighter air of
the river, and the street emerged upon the brow of a terraced
hill, which presided over an ochre-coloured canal, a group of
empty smokestacks, and the smothered fires of the sunset. Farther
away the sad-looking hill was enlivened by a bleached plot of
grass, a fantastic iron fountain, protected alike from man and
beast by a green railing and a scattered row of inhospitable
benches. On the benches a few solitary old men were patiently
waiting for happiness; and where the street came to an abrupt end
over the gloomy canal, Mrs. Burden's house was perched as
insecurely as the forsaken nest of a hawk. It was an endless
source of mortification to Mr. Littlepage that his elder brother,
the head of the house since the death from octogenarian excesses
of his uncle Powhatan, should choose to present the appearance,
when he had by no means reached the condition, of beggarly
circumstances. Virginius had reasoned earnestly and fruitlessly
upon the subject; but then, as he reflected despondently, all his
arguments with Marmaduke were as fruitless as they were earnest.
For a few weeks after his return to America, Marmaduke had taken
temporary shelter with Virginius and Victoria; and on both sides
of the family this experiment had ended in one of those complete
disillusionments which, as the refugee jocosely observed, "can be
faced only by turning your back on them." Victoria, who admired
art rather than artists, was disappointed to find that Marmaduke
was a futurist in morals. Even this, trained as she was in the
tradition of perfect behaviour, she might have been able less to
excuse as a fault than to overlook as a fact; but no amount of
practice in evading reality could blind her to the proof that he
was far from spotless in his attire. It is true that a wooden leg
excused, she felt, a measure of carelessness. Her sympathetic
heart had almost accepted this substitute as a mute plea for
indulgence, when she was saddened again by the discovery that
Marmaduke, even without a leg, was too sure of his ancestors to
be particular about his acquaintances. The struggle between the
habit of refinement and the habit of not having habits continued
to wear on Victoria's nerves without ruffling her sweetness of
temper. She was attached to Marmaduke; she was sympathetic; she
was even indulgent; but she could not shut her eyes to the
unfortunate truth that he was bad for the children. Marmaduke, on
the contrary, who was attached to nobody, respected, and within
reason, as he was careful to explain, admired Victoria. "The
institution of marriage was invented for her," he had remarked,
"and you can't blame her for defending it against the invincible
adversary. Some day, as even Victoria knows, her defences will
fall, and then what will become of her? But I'll say this for
your wife," he had concluded, with a dash of enthusiasm in his
voice, "there is less humbug in her morality than in most. She is
the only woman I know who isn't two-thirds sham, and I haven't
forgotten Louisa."</p>
<p>At the end of the visit an armed truce was established; and an
armed truce, Mr. Littlepage conceded, is more successful in
maintaining a balance of power than in promoting tribal
festivities. It was impossible to deny that Victoria had emerged
from the conflict with flying colours; but when Virginius had
attempted to deal logically with Marmaduke, he soon perceived
that the head of the family displayed as little respect for logic
as he had shown for legitimate ties. In one of his vagabond
fancies (which Victoria had found more disconcerting than temper)
Marmaduke had shaken civilization and regular hours from his
shoulders, and had entrenched his disreputable habits in the
attic on Juniper Hill. "How can there be any civilization without
regular hours?" Victoria had inquired reasonably. "He eats only
when he is hungry, and then without laying a cloth." Virginius,
who agreed with Victoria, and felt that the order of the universe
depended upon punctuality, had decided that a situation which
contained a single artist and all the conventions was crowded
with difficulties. Yet, in the very hour of his defeat, while he
concurred in Victoria's opinion that "you can't take art very
seriously when it doesn't bring you a living," he was unhappily
aware that the buccaneer in his blood was allied with his
brother.</p>
<p>This early November afternoon, while he stepped briskly over
the mat of coloured leaves on the hill, no observer would have
suspected that a roving buccaneer was hidden beneath the cloak of
his correct Sabbath attire. With his handsome, though slightly
pompous, features, which wore the look of heroic complacency that
makes all Southern gentlemen resemble one another in the eyes of
a stranger, he looked, as indeed he was, except for his vagabond
impulses, a perfect example of what money can do when it has good
material to work upon. But in his perturbed mind he was thinking,
"I wonder if anything can be wrong with me? Is it only that the
war has made all the rest of life seem distorted and out of
proportion? Or can it be that my liver is going against me?" For
he belonged to that normal masculine breed whose emotions are
firmly seated not in the soul, but in the liver.</p>
<p>He had quickened his pace to avoid a perambulator pushed by an
inattentive negro nurse, when the door of the house he was
passing opened and shut, and a woman in a red hat and a mole-skin
coat descended the littered steps to the gate. As her luminous
brown eyes swept his face, he came to a sudden stop, and stood
waiting. "How little she has changed!" he thought, while it
seemed to him that a faint drumming vibrated through the depths
of his being. "How little she has changed, and yet there is a
difference." Her hair was still amber; the colour in her cheeks
was still as ripe as the bloom on a peach; her queenly bosom,
beneath the slim lines of her coat, was still opulent. At a
distance he had thought her as straight as a pole; but he
perceived now, with an admiration the modern figure never aroused
in him, that only the fashion of her dress, not the perfect
curves of the 'nineties, had altered.</p>
<p>"Why, Mrs. Dalrymple!" he exclaimed, and there was a thrill of
pleasure in his voice as he held out his hand.</p>
<p>Before yielding her gloved hand, she hesitated an instant and
looked up inquiringly from beneath darkened lashes. So the brown
velvet of her gaze had caressed him on that August evening; and
while his nerves quivered like the strings of a harp under
sensitive fingers, he felt for the first time in months, for the
first time in years, that he had not yet outlived the age of
delight. With her over-ripe but still voluptuous beauty, the
brilliant fairness of her complexion, and the glimmering dusk of
her eyes, she had awakened, however briefly, that old torment of
unsatisfied longing. He remembered her not only as the woman he
might have loved, but even more poignantly as the woman he might
have possessed. This, he told himself triumphantly, was the
beauty that had the power to wreck homes and make history. In its
late autumn season, he felt that Mrs. Dalrymple's charm was
sweetened with a honey which only the full-bodied masculine taste
of the 'nineties had known how to appreciate.</p>
<p>"What a fool I was!" he thought bitterly, so far had he
travelled from the moral idealism of the nineteenth century.
Well, in spite of moral idealism, men had known how to enjoy life
in the long ages when women were weaker and whisky was
Bourbon.</p>
<p>"You!" Mrs. Dalrymple breathed forgivingly; and the look in
her deep dark eyes was as challenging, he told himself, as
champagne to a prohibitionist. From a provincial and pretty
widow, with a soft heart and a brittle character, she had been
transformed by Europe and her war record into a bright, hard
woman of the world, who had exchanged her birthright of modesty
for a profitable understanding of men. That double-edged blessing
for a Southern lady, an ardent thirst for life and capacity for
enjoyment, had not, he suspected from her scarlet mouth and
hearty manner, diminished. Her laugh was as kind and as exciting
as ever; the rich curves of her cheek and lips were as tempting;
and though her figure was too womanly for the scant fashions of
the present, Mr. Littlepage had matured in an era when restrained
abundance rather than flatness unconfined appealed to the robust
instincts of man.</p>
<p>"She is nearly fifty, and almost as handsome as ever," he
decided. "Well, that is what Europe and widowhood can do for a
woman."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dalrymple, who had been blessed with sex attraction, but
would have preferred, as she grew older, a moderate amount of
card sense or even a strong religious belief, could have
enlightened him still further on the subjects of Europe and
widowhood. Though he would have been among the last to suspect
the truth, it is literal, if not poetic, to describe her as the
helpless victim of circumstances. Endowed with much energy and
little temperament, she might have remained as virtuous as Louisa
had her figure been less pronounced or the field of woman's
activities more varied. But in the late 'nineties, when she had
flourished and fallen, an immense feminine vitality was confined
with the narrow range of a wasp-waist and the exacting ritual of
being a lady. A deceptive bosom, which inspired hope in men, and
a naturally kind heart, which hesitated to dispense
disappointment, had been, if not the occasion, at least the
original cause, of her frailty. Never in her life had she
deliberately harmed anyone, not even a woman; and the wonder
grew, as she looked back over the past, that so little pleasure
could have produced so great a catastrophe. It is true that when
men were deceived by her ripe mouth and rich bosom, her kind
heart had made but a feeble show of resistance; but these
episodes, after they had happened, invariably seemed to her to
have occurred in her sleep. Few women had profited more by the
war. Even her queenly figure had been subdued to the service of
patriotism; and her renown for easy virtue had yielded, though
not without a struggle, to a reputation for heroic exploits.
Twice, it was said, she had carried or dragged a wounded soldier
from under fire into safety; once she had saved, or assisted in
saving, all the inmates from a burning field hospital; and three
times she had received foreign decorations for gallantry.
Royalty, undeterred by her sins, had welcomed her with
encouraging requests for both moral and financial support. Her
picture, taken in the peasant dress of Berengaria, as she
presented an American bank cheque to the queen of that
interesting kingdom, had adorned the Sunday supplements of the
American Press. In this exhilarating atmosphere, it is little
wonder that coquetry became a means rather than an end to
adventure; or that the pursuit of sex appeared a mistaken, as
well as an uncongenial, vocation. Even her notorious past, which
was attached, she felt, by the merest thread of an accident, had
crumbled away and scattered like pollen over the fertile soil of
the war zone. After the Armistice, it is true, there came a vast
emptiness. In an hour, it seemed to her, the euphemistic Powers
of Europe had made of her life a desert and called it peace. Not,
of course, that she had wished the war to continue. Like many
other women, she hated and feared war in general, and worshipped
it in the particular instance; and her kind heart still suffered
whenever she allowed herself to think of the killed and wounded.
Nevertheless, so long as there was a war, and she was as innocent
as a babe in the matter, she thanked her stars, with a clear
conscience, that she had not avoided this historic prelude to
glory. Never, until she engaged in active combat, had she been
able to understand how the sex that invented battle and murder
and rape could have invented also, without a change of heart
apparently, monogamy and the perfect lady and the Protestant
Episcopal Church. In the end, since the war left her precisely as
it had found her, with a vacant mind and a well-stored heart, her
inexhaustible vitality was stranded among all the trifling
occupations of peace. Again she made an honest effort to enjoy
the moderate activities of a sphere in which there seemed to be
increasingly little to do. If her preparation for life had been
restricted, it appeared that her opportunities for exercise were
even more limited. It was natural, it was perhaps inevitable,
that she should have drifted back at last to her old
happiness-hunting and moral preserves. What was left for a fallen
lady, she had demanded almost passionately of the Everlasting
Purpose, except the most ancient vocation? Though she nourished
few illusions, and none of these dealt with the nature of man,
she had not failed to observe that for a Southern lady in reduced
circumstances and with an impaired reputation, love is the only
available means of increasing an income. A wealthy marriage, she
would have been the first to admit, was too much to expect. For,
even though men are indulgent, an ample fortune, she realized,
bargains shrewdly for at least a technical virtue; and toward
marriage without an ample fortune she felt no inclination. But
two marriages and one divorce for love had taught her, before the
war and tributes to the crowned heads of Europe had depleted her
substance, that even widowhood or the path of virtue may be made
easy by a generous allowance.</p>
<p>"Never again!" she had resolved, as she meditated upon the
natural trials of love and the inadequacy of men as lovers. "I've
had more love than most women, I suppose, and what has it ever
done for me in the past?" After a pause, in which she summed up
the uncertain rewards of the passion, she had concluded, with
that ripe wisdom which is so often the fruit of imperfect
behaviour, "Nothing. Absolutely nothing that I can show for it.
Nothing that will be worth a row of pins to me when I am old. If
you're careful, card sense will stay by you when you need it, and
sometimes put money in your pocket long after you have lost your
looks. But presents, even if they are set in platinum, go out of
fashion." Then, since she had been a realist from the beginning,
before the bottom dropped out of idealism, she determined to be
guided by prudence rather than generosity in every love affair
that came after fifty. For it was not, she decided, as if she had
ever benefited by what she dismissed, no doubt inaccurately, as
the overrated pleasures of love. "Even when I was at my best, and
especially when I was at my best, a love affair was sure to be
over and done with just as I was beginning really to enjoy it."
And it occurred to her, since, like many philosophers and not a
few saints, she had approached the ascetic point of view by the
downward path, that love, in common with other benefits to be
derived from the prudent pleasures of men, invariably appears
either too soon or too late. How often had she watched elderly
ladies (who were more estimable than tempting) assemble with
eager eyes round the card-table, at the exact moment when they
desired with all their souls to play bridge. How often, at such
instants, had she sighed to herself: "If only they realized what
it means to have found a solace that is there when you need it."
For even this last resource of vacancy had been denied her by a
mind that had never been able to think twice about anything and a
figure that had falsely advertised her as ardent. "All the same,"
she was thinking not more than two minutes before she recognized
Mr. Littlepage, "if I had my life to live over again, I'd know
better than to put my main dependence upon love." Then, while the
thought fluttered in her mind as wildly as a swallow circles in
an empty barn, she looked ahead and saw a conventional male
figure approaching. Instantly, without effort, without purpose,
the glow of amorous challenge shone in her eyes, and the smile of
provocative mystery wavered and vanished and wavered again on her
lips.</p>
<p>"You!" was the only word that escaped her; for experience had
taught her the value of monosyllabic responses. Though he was not
all that she could have wished, she admitted reluctantly that he
was more perhaps than she had a right to expect. After all,
though she had finished with love, no wise and prudent woman, she
knew, is ever entirely finished with lovers.</p>
<p>"It has been very long," he said pensively, "since you went
away."</p>
<p>"Almost twelve years," she answered, with a sigh that she
tried to make cheerful, or at least not discouraging. For after
fifty, as she reminded herself for the hundredth time, few women
can afford to be depressing, and none can afford to be
particular. "I was in Europe when the war came, and I simply
stayed on. I helped to open one of the first hospitals in
France."</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard of it. In fact, I sent you a contribution. My
daughter heard of you everywhere, even in the Balkans. She wrote
us that your war record was wonderful."</p>
<p>"I suppose everything seemed wonderful while the war lasted."
How clear her eyes were, how bright and gay her smile for the
possessor of a lost or even an imperfectly restored character!
But he remembered now that she had always left a more vivid
impression than anyone else, that her colour and gaiety had often
rushed into his memory like a running fire in a November
landscape.</p>
<p>"Yes, to those of us who stayed at home you appeared to have
cornered all the adventure."</p>
<p>"And you never came over?"</p>
<p>"No, it is the greatest regret of my life. Wars for me have
always come at the wrong age. I've either had to wave flags or
roll bandages."</p>
<p>"Well, there isn't much fun in that." Was there the faintest
tinge of mirth in her voice? "I've sometimes thought that the
worst thing about the war was that so many of us who were not
hurt really enjoyed it. When it was over, we had nothing to fall
back on but bottomless futility. I didn't wish it to go on, of
course," she added, with a shudder, and wondered if she were not
becoming too serious, "but I missed the waiting for horrors when
it was over. In the last five years or so I have had nothing to
do but try to put time into a kind of twilight sleep." Then the
look of anxious wonder was driven from her eyes by a sparkling
infusion of coquetry. "I wasn't that way twelve years ago--but
you must have forgotten."</p>
<p>A swift pulsation quivered and died in some elemental
darkness. "No, I haven't forgotten. But why did you go away?"
What a fool, what an egregious fool he had been twelve years ago,
when she was in the flower of her beauty, and that flower might
have been his for the plucking!</p>
<p>"I went away," she answered slowly, "because I needed to learn
about life."</p>
<p>"About life?"</p>
<p>"About life and love." Was she laughing at him? Was she
deriding his former resistance? Or was she seriously leading him
on? Twenty, even ten years ago, he would not have hesitated over
the answer. But at that age he had still his ten, he had still
his twenty years of vigour ahead of him. On this November
afternoon it seemed to him that his retreating youth wore the
aspect less of a fugitive season than of a perennial estate.</p>
<p>"I thought," he said, "that you knew all there was to be known
about love." Though he tried to borrow her lightness of touch, he
was aware that a fatuous expression was spreading like melted wax
over his features.</p>
<p>She shook her head, and her lashes drooped while a pensive
note crept into her caressing voice. "No, there was one thing I
had never learned. I had never learned why there is so little
kindness in love."</p>
<p>He looked at her in surprise. "Are you sure there is
little?"</p>
<p>"I am seventy times sure. I have had love seventy times, but
not once have I had loving-kindness." Her eyes softened into
pathos, and he asked himself, with a stab of memory, if she had
suffered all these years because he had been true to Victoria?
Was it within the bounds of probability that Mrs. Dalrymple (who
was still accessible) had cared for him more deeply than he had
ever imagined?</p>
<p>"Perhaps you did not look for it," he urged gently. "If you
had looked for it, you might have found it."</p>
<p>She shook her head, and it seemed to him that her dark eyes
lost their challenge and were drowned in a plaintive sadness.
"All my life I have looked for it. It may be that I needed it too
much ever to find it. I sometimes think that loving-kindness,
like chivalry, is saved for the women who do not need it."</p>
<p>For an instant, so vehement was his response to her voice and
her wistful smile, it seemed to him that he was in peril of
losing not only his heart, but (and this was more important to
his legal mind) his judgment as well. "Surely you have
forgotten," he answered tenderly, "surely you have forgotten that
I gave you kindness once when you needed it."</p>
<p>A change passed over her face, as if it were suddenly
enkindled by the dying flare of the sunset. "You gave me
kindness, but not love," she breathed so softly that her voice
rather than her words invaded his senses.</p>
<p>A flush rose to his cheek, and while his features burned with
embarrassment--or was it pleasure?--he exclaimed as impulsively
as if time had reversed its process, and they were standing again
beneath those Bacchic garlands, "Then you never knew! You never
suspected!" In that quivering light her face swam before him, and
he wondered, with an inward tremor, if there were tears in the
unfathomable dusk of her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah, I suffered too much to suspect anything!"</p>
<p>While the words still floated toward him, she turned away and
walked swiftly from the brow of the hill into the approaching
shadows of twilight. For an instant, with a sensation of
dizziness, he looked after her. Then, casting an involuntary
glance over his shoulder, he straightened his figure and passed
on with a confident stride. It was true that she was still
accessible. It was true also that, after twelve unprofitable
years, though she was no longer young, all the drab world had
come to life again when he looked at her. Nothing, he realized
now, had ever assuaged the old torment of longing. Nothing had
ever moved him so deeply as that haunting promise of joy deferred
but not defeated which she exhaled like a perfume. "I suppose
I've always wanted her," he thought, "even when I was not
thinking about her. The trouble with her is that she makes all
other women, even younger and prettier women, appear only half
animate." Yesterday he had believed that passion ended with
youth, or lingered on in middle age as an antiquated survival.
Now, he told himself, nothing mattered, least of all the fugitive
moods of the young. Every age, he had discovered, has its own
sphere of influence. Every age (there was comfort in this
reflection) has its own peculiar ardours and indiscretions. After
all, he was only fifty-seven, and at fifty-seven a man is still
young enough to be tempted and to yield to temptation.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>He opened Mrs. Burden's creaking gate, passed up the walk of
sunken flag-stones, and entered the hall, which was pervaded by a
yellowish dusk and the smell of boiled cabbage. At the foot of
the fine old staircase Milly Burden was standing, and it seemed
to him that the light had gone out of her face and left it
drained of expectancy. "She is wasted as if from a mortal
illness," he thought, with a throb of compassion. "This is what
happens to women who have neither religion nor the sense of duty
to fall back upon. It isn't only love she has lost. It is
everything. Everything," he amended presently, "except the right
to live her own life." And it occurred to him, while he enfolded
her hands in his grasp, that the right to live her own life was a
frail support compared to a womanly trust in Omnipotence. Though
he was by no means unacquainted with grief, and thirty years of
the law had prepared him for the usual wages of sin, he told
himself sadly that he had never seen a look of deeper despair.
Other women had lost their lovers; other women had been betrayed
and abandoned; but these other women had appeared always to have
something left over, if it was nothing more than redemption. Poor
Aunt Agatha, who had suffered as much as a woman could, had clung
firmly, though submissively, not only to her simple trust in the
Protestant Episcopal Church, but even to her maidenly faith in
men. For it was impossible to deny that poor Aunt Agatha had
observed the superstitions as thoroughly as she had discarded the
moral principle of the Victorian age. Ruined, she had still
trusted. Her betrayal, which had broken her heart, spoiled her
life, and irretrievably impaired her value, had failed apparently
to ruffle the surface of her settled convictions. And there was
Mrs. Dalrymple, he reminded himself, who had become a romantic
rather than an intellectual iconoclast. In spite of her immodest
activities, she was as little inclined to dispute the merit of
the double standard as poor Aunt Agatha was to question the
authority of Saint Paul's views upon feminine deportment. Their
suffering, he realized, had been alleviated by reverence for the
powers that afflicted them. But with Milly, and perhaps with
others of her refractory generation, every pious support had been
already demolished. What was left to her, he inquired, with
merciless logic, after she had rejected alike the moral law and
the expert testimony of experience?</p>
<p>"I see you have heard, my dear," he began gently, while he
turned with her into the dusty living-room, which was filled with
the last glimmer of daylight.</p>
<p>"Yes, I've heard. Your brother told me. He saw it in the
paper, and he told me. He told me."</p>
<p>"Don't, my child, don't," Mr. Littlepage pleaded. He had been
prepared for tears. He had been prepared for anything, he felt,
except for eyes in which tears had frozen to ice.</p>
<p>"You must pluck up your courage, Milly. A cad like that isn't
worth your little finger."</p>
<p>"I know," she breathed angrily. "You can't tell me anything
worse than I know already. But that doesn't give me back my life.
That doesn't give me back all the love I wasted." For an instant
he thought that her frozen surface had broken and that she would
melt into tears. Then, with a gesture of repudiation, she laughed
again in the same toneless voice. "But I am not going to talk
about it. Not even to you am I going to talk about it."</p>
<p>"That is the best way. You know, whatever happens, I am your
friend."</p>
<p>She smiled without a trace of emotion. "Nothing will happen
now. I've felt all I can feel."</p>
<p>"I wish I could help you."</p>
<p>"There isn't any help. There isn't anything but
hollowness."</p>
<p>"Not now perhaps, but there will be later. You are too young
for happiness to be over. One mistake doesn't seem so important
to-day, I suppose, as it seemed before. We may build a better
life on our regrets."</p>
<p>Her laugh stabbed his heart. "Oh, I haven't any regrets, not
what you would call regrets. I had a right to my life, and if I
spoiled it, that is my affair. Nobody else had anything in the
world to do with my life. Nobody else, not you, not mother, not
Martin. Nobody else."</p>
<p>The air, which had seemed so stale and lifeless when he
entered, was charged now with vitality, with passion, and with an
emotion, so vehement, so despairing, that it could be only
anguish. Her face was as expressionless as a mask; but beneath
its waxen immobility, he felt, there was the frozen isolation of
youth that believed nothing. Anything, he told himself, even
Christian forgiveness, was better than this. Though he had been
exasperated as a child by poor Aunt Agatha's wronged but
unresentful attitude, he realized now that there was much to be
said for a code of manners so influential that its authority was
exerted over the frail and the fallen. So unstable, indeed, are
contemporary verdicts that within the last five years Aunt Agatha
had shown signs of becoming more of an ornament than a disgrace
to genealogy. Having risen poetically to the test of sentimental
tradition, she was pointed out by the younger generation as a
classic example of antique betrayal. Well, no doubt there was an
argument, if he could find it, in favour of the new freedom; and
society was probably safer, though men were less so, since
seducers had ceased to be anonymous and seductions had ceased to
be private. According to ancient ritual the true woman in
dishonour had preserved her guilty secret to her grave, except,
of course, on the stage, where she was required, by public
scruples and the exigencies of the drama, to babble about her
past. Today, or so it appeared to him, all that had changed; yet
love, in its ecstasies, its cruelties, and its contradictions,
had not altered. Love was still the creator and the devourer of
life.</p>
<p>Suddenly he became aware that Milly was speaking in a tone of
passionate anger--or was it passionate agony? "I gave everything
I had. I waited. Through all those horrible years, I
waited--"</p>
<p>"Yet you never told him?"</p>
<p>"It was for his sake. I knew he was unhappy--and, if I had,
what could he have done? But I thought he loved me. Oh, I thought
he loved me!" She flung out her arm in despair, while it seemed
to Mr. Littlepage that the dusk was alive with her sobbing. The
firelight had died down, but a single thin blue flame wavered and
sank and wavered again in a flickering pattern. By this desolate
light her face and even her hands looked as pallid and
insubstantial as mist.</p>
<p>"We've agreed not to talk of it, Milly," he said tenderly.
"The less we talk of it, the easier it will be for you to get
over it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know, I know." There was a buried sound in her voice,
as if her sobs had turned to lumps of earth in her throat. "I am
not going to talk of it."</p>
<p>"In a little while you will be able to put it out of your
mind."</p>
<p>"Yes, I will put it out of my mind. In a little while I will
put it out of my mind. Everything but the hatred. I shall never
get over the hatred--"</p>
<p>"But that is the worst part of it all. Can't you see that as
long as you nurse hatred in your heart, you haven't got over
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I can't help hating. Hating is something you can't
help any more than you can help loving. Did you ever hate
anybody? Did you ever hate so bitterly that you wanted to
kill?"</p>
<p>"My dear, my dear . . ." No, he had never in his life hated;
nor, for the matter of that, had he indulged in any other
vehement emotion. To be sure, he had been in love more than once;
but when he looked back now it seemed to him that his love had
been woven of sentiment rather than passion. In every case, even
in his brief infatuation for Mrs. Dalrymple, he had been able to
wave a valedictory blessing after his departed romance. And if
violence was incompatible with the character of a Virginia
gentleman, how much more repugnant must it appear to the ideal of
pure womanhood. In the mannerly past, as Mr. Littlepage reminded
himself, even womanhood that had ceased to be pure turned
naturally to a drooping melancholia instead of to the more active
homicidal derangements. "You must not say such things. You must
not allow them even to enter your mind," he urged, with genuine
distress.</p>
<p>"If you have never hated anybody, you don't know what it
means," Milly replied, without tears, but in a voice that was
still eloquent with passion.</p>
<p>"How can you hate anyone you've loved so deeply, my
child?"</p>
<p>"How could I hate him if I hadn't loved him?" she demanded.
Yes, it was impossible for a logical mind to understand women,
Mr. Littlepage mused despondently, and he asked himself a moment
later how the Almighty could have ever expected men and women
together to make the earth civilized?</p>
<p>"Well, we must forget all that, Milly," he said presently.
"Remember you have promised me not to talk about it. No matter
how bad things may be, it doesn't make them any worse to keep
hoping for the best."</p>
<p>"There isn't any best."</p>
<p>"My dear, there is always a best," he answered; for this was
the way they had drilled cheerfulness into the young in the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>"Then I don't want the best. I want happiness. I have a right
to be happy."</p>
<p>A right to be happy! How far, indeed, had they travelled since
poor Aunt Agatha's fall? Neither Aunt Agatha nor Mrs. Dalrymple
had ever dared to advance the bold, modern theory of "a right to
happiness." In the nineteenth century, and indeed before and
after the nineteenth century, human nature, particularly feminine
human nature, had possessed no rights, only duties. Vividly Mr.
Littlepage recalled a discussion one dreary Sunday afternoon,
when his father, feeling more Victorian than Georgian at the
moment, had stoutly denied the moral right to resist eternal
damnation so long as that robust doctrine contributed to the
greater glory of God. Well, moral right had triumphed to-day over
even more inflexible doctrines. Duty, when it survived at all in
the mind of the young, had revolved into an alarming centrifugal
force. Nobody, not even the most unbridled philanthropist, not
even Louisa Goddard or Mary Victoria, spoke, except in moments of
heated discussion, of his own private duty. Always, when this
antiquated term was used, it referred either to the public duty
of others or to some paternal activity of the Republic. In Mary
Victoria's letters, though the word "duty" occurred as
rhythmically and almost as inaccurately as it occurs in the
beginning of a war or at the end of a love affair, it was used
less in the feminine sense of the thing that one preferred not to
do than as the more dignified masculine synonym for the easiest
way. Well, if women had at last usurped the ancient prerogative
of man, who, Mr. Littlepage inquired of his soul, was in a
position to oppose them with safety?</p>
<p>"You must remember, my child, that happiness is not a right,
but a blessing," he said, after an anxious pause.</p>
<p>"Is it? Then I've a right to a blessing."</p>
<p>"Your tone hurts me, Milly. Don't let this one mistake make
you bitter and hard."</p>
<p>She laughed with mirthless derision. "Oh, I want to be hard. I
want to be hard and bitter."</p>
<p>"Don't, my dear. That doesn't sound like you. It doesn't
sound--" His reactionary tongue (for, as most sermons and all
politics prove, the tongue is a reactionary member and often
trips up advanced opinions) was about to supply the word
"womanly." Fortunately, however, experience rather than judgment
warned him that this epithet, though still respectable, had
ceased to be flattering. While he tried in vain to think of
something to add, shreds of Louisa Goddard's lectures floated
loosely about in his mind; but, he dismissed these wisps of
research as unimportant, except to those who no longer needed
conversion.</p>
<p>"Should you like to go away, Milly?" he asked abruptly, for
this seemed to him the most promising suggestion that he could
make. "Perhaps a change of scene would make it easier for you to
put this unworthy object out of your thoughts."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Not now. Not until I've fought it out on
the spot. There's only one thing that would make it easier," she
continued quietly, "and that is a vacation from mother."</p>
<p>"Well, we might arrange that." He caught hopefully at the
plan. "Let me send her to Florida for the winter."</p>
<p>"She wouldn't go. Her duty isn't in Florida, and nothing but a
wedge could separate her from her duty. The worst of it is that I
am her duty--"</p>
<p>"Suppose I talk to her?"</p>
<p>"You might as well argue with the weather."</p>
<p>He sighed. "Well, my dear, if there's any way I can help you,
you know I'm only too willing."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know." Her voice was as unresponsive as her
expression. Gratitude, like love, appeared to have died in her.
"We've forgotten that we were not going to talk about it."</p>
<p>"After this, we'll remember. Now, if there's nothing I can do
for you, I'll go up to the studio. But remember that I am eager
to help you in any possible way. You know I shall always feel
that I have been to blame."</p>
<p>As she followed him to the door, the gas-jet in the hall threw
an unsteady light on her features, and he told himself that there
was a vein of iron beneath her bloom. The contour of her face had
settled into a look of defiant composure, and her blue eyes,
which he had once compared to April flowers, were now as hard and
gem-like as lapis lazuli. "Her best days are over," he thought
regretfully, "and she would have made some man a wonderful
wife."</p>
<p>"You mean that you asked your daughter to find him?" she said
in so low a voice that he was obliged to bend his ear before he
could distinguish the words.</p>
<p>"If I had not," he answered slowly, "they would never have
met."</p>
<p>"And this would not have happened."</p>
<p>"And this would not have happened." Her eyes were wide open,
staring up at the light, and he was so close to her that it
seemed to him he could see tiny sparks in the blackness of the
pupils. "But she knew that he was my lover."</p>
<p>"Yes, she knew, but she couldn't have understood. I blame
myself. I blame myself bitterly."</p>
<p>"Oh, she understood! But women are like that."</p>
<p>A shadow stole over the flame in her eyes, and this shadow
passed into Mr. Littlepage's face while he watched her. "Mary
Victoria is different," he answered in a troubled tone. "She is
high-minded and unselfish. She must have felt that she was doing
right."</p>
<p>"I know. The right thing is always what she does."</p>
<p>His face flushed. "I can't listen to that, my dear. You must
not criticize Mary Victoria to me." Surely standards had fallen,
he told himself, if frailty in woman could defy triumphant
virtue. Fugitive scenes from his early boyhood returned to him,
and he remembered poor Aunt Agatha shrinking, with the immemorial
gesture of the Magdalen, from the startled presence of
chastity.</p>
<p>"Did she tell you why it happened?" Milly asked in a tone that
was more scornful than meek.</p>
<p>"Yes, she said she did it to save that--that young fool--" the
epithet burst out explosively.</p>
<p>"To save him?" Milly breathed. "You mean from me?"</p>
<p>"No, my dear, from destruction. You must remember that he was
in--well, in severe straits when she found him."</p>
<p>"Didn't she find him for me?"</p>
<p>"I thought so. Certainly I asked her to look for him on your
account. Then they were thrown together too much, I dare say. I
believe he helped her with her orphanage in the Balkans. After
all, you must make allowances for their falling in love. There
never has been, and never will be, fairness in love." He drove in
this point with emphasis. "But, even then, I am convinced that
Mary Victoria would never have married him if she had not felt
she was doing the right thing."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is easy to feel that. All it requires is a little
practice."</p>
<p>He frowned. "You would not say that if you knew my daughter.
Her whole life is devoted to doing good. She was decorated over
and over again for her war service. It isn't her fault if she is
the kind of woman who becomes an inspiration to others." His
voice increased in volume as he went on. In the last few years he
had repeated these phrases so often that they had begun to sound
as infallible as a confession of faith.</p>
<p>"Is she really so beautiful?" Milly inquired, in her mocking
tone.</p>
<p>"Well, of course, she can't help being beautiful any more than
men can keep from admiring beautiful women. You know that
yourself, my dear," he added indulgently. "And now, before I go
upstairs, promise me that you will try to get over it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll get over it. Don't people always get over
things?"</p>
<p>With that derisive answer ringing in his ears, he left the
room and ascended the curving staircase to Marmaduke's studio.
Yes, it was useless to deny that a sense of duty, however infirm,
had been an incalculable advantage in dealing with women.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c111" id="c111">XI</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>At the top of the dusty staircase a door was open, and plumes
of yellow lamplight streamed out into the passage. As Mr.
Littlepage ascended, he heard the querulous whine of a confirmed
widow, and knew that Mrs. Burden must have preceded him. "I
shouldn't have come if I had known she was there," he thought
ruefully. "How in the world is Marmaduke able to put up with
her?"</p>
<p>"My advice is worth so little, my dear lady," Marmaduke was
saying airily, "that I hesitate to inflict it upon you. If you
need the opinion of a man of sense, you had better consult my
brother Virginius."</p>
<p>That was Marmaduke always. Even without the mellifluous tones,
Mr. Littlepage would have recognized the tincture of Marmaduke's
irony. Though he was both an artist and a bachelor, two
conditions of life that aroused immediate suspicion in
Queenborough, the opportune loss of a leg in the war had restored
him, in a measure at least, to public esteem.</p>
<p>"I keep reminding her that I have a right to her confidence,"
Mrs. Burden was wailing, "but it is no use. She never tells me
anything."</p>
<p>"Well, here is Virginius. He ought to be able to condole with
you," responded Marmaduke, who was drinking coffee beside a
littered table upon which Mrs. Burden had just placed an untidy
tray. Thirty years before, or even twenty for that matter,
Marmaduke was one of the handsomest men of his age; and
undeterred by the theory that the feminine eye is indifferent to
beauty in the opposite sex, he had made himself irresistible to
every woman but Louisa Goddard. Now, approaching sixty, he was
still distinguished; he was even impressive. His leonine head was
adorned by a picturesque mane of grey hair; his skin was clear
and ruddy; and his eyebrows, still dark and thick, beetled over a
pair of large, deep, and singularly living blue eyes. Beneath his
romantic nose, which had been compared in his youth to Byron's, a
short, silvery beard spread away from a mouth that was considered
"too fleshy for a refined taste." Even as long ago as the last
century, it had occurred to Mr. Littlepage that a mouth like
Marmaduke's was as fateful as destiny. Could the most exemplary
character have triumphed over such unvegetarian, not to say
carnal, lips? "I ought to thank God for my escape," Virginius had
frequently reminded himself; for, if he had lost much of the
simple piety of his youth, God was still the oldest and the most
venerated of his traditions.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Littlepage respected art, and was fond of remarking
that he liked any colour so long as it was red, few occasions
were more embarrassing to him than those upon which he
encountered a lady in Marmaduke's studio. To be sure, the room
was large, the disorder great, and the four long windows
presented a creditable view of earth and sky. But even the
thinnest apprehension could scarcely retreat behind these
defences; and surrounded by Marmaduke's improbable nudes,
Virginius was assailed afresh by the suspicion that every woman
was purple under her clothes. Directly in front of him an
undraped female figure was standing beneath a florid sky, with
her feet buried in splashes of orange beach and vermilion sea. On
her right another naked woman with indelicate limbs was (of all
unlikely occupations!) sewing a white seam in the midst of an
apple-green hill, under the pink thoughts of a flowering
almond-tree. "What on earth!" Virginius thought, turning away.
"Is the world going mad? Or is Marmaduke already demented?"</p>
<p>"I've done something new in this one," Marmaduke was saying in
the jesting tone in which he talked of art to Virginius. "It
isn't only the loosening of technique, though I've tried to see
how far I could go that way. But you'll notice a new fluency both
in the design and the brushwork. There's a kind of symphonic
rhythm--"</p>
<p>No, Mr. Littlepage had not the remotest idea of his meaning.
All that nonsense, he told himself angrily, might be the patter
of modernism; but the only impression it made was to strengthen
his innate belief that human flesh is in some way obscene. In the
old days artists, if they were Americans, had painted decently,
and had draped their figures either in classic raiment or in
symbolical clouds. But the decorous symbols of Victorian art bore
as little resemblance to Marmaduke's carnivorous nudes as a
creamed cauliflower bears to an under-done beefsteak. Well, it
was fruitless to regret; it was fruitless to reason; it was
fruitless even to wonder. On the whole, he preferred to look at
Mrs. Burden, who was depressing but decent in appearance, though
she wore at the moment an agitated frown, as if her moral fibre
had suddenly become unbuttoned.</p>
<p>"You must have discovered that I have as little taste for
symphonic rhythms as I have for modern art," he observed
brusquely, and added in a kinder tone, "Is there anything I can
do for you, Mrs. Burden?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden, long, narrow, and faintly greenish in colour,
turned upon him the tight mouth and the bleak stare of
predestination. "It is about Milly, sir," she replied grimly. "I
was reproaching Mr. Marmaduke before you came in--"</p>
<p>"Reproaching him?" Mr. Littlepage repeated, in horror.</p>
<p>"Oh no, sir. I didn't mean that." Mrs. Burden's cheek flushed
to the mottled lavender of outraged virtue. "It is only that he
encourages her attitude."</p>
<p>"But it seems to me, my dear lady, that her attitude is
commendable."</p>
<p>"You speak like a citizen of the twentieth century,
Virginius," Marmaduke observed, putting down his cup and
searching among the bottles on his table for a half-empty
decanter. "As far as I am able to make out, this good lady is
shocked by what you and I regard as rational conduct."</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden, who had had her troubles but had never been
unrefined, wiped her reddened eyelids on a black-bordered
handkerchief. "I expected nothing less of Mr. Marmaduke," she
said, "for artists are not bothered by moral convictions. But I
shouldn't have believed that you also would encourage Milly."</p>
<p>"Encourage her? Why, I am doing my best to help her to make
something of her life."</p>
<p>"That, Virginius, is what Mrs. Burden holds against us,"
Marmaduke explained in a serious voice. "She feels that it is
immodest to recover from a seduction. The moral taboo requires
that she should remain, like poor Aunt Agatha, a ruin."</p>
<p>"If such thing had ever happened to me," whimpered Mrs.
Burden, "I am sure that I should never have held up my head
again."</p>
<p>"Does she really mean that she wishes Milly to be marked for
life?" Mr. Littlepage demanded incredulously of his brother.</p>
<p>Though Marmaduke wore a look of innocent gravity, Virginius
suspected that he was enjoying rather than deriding Mrs. Burden's
evangelical conscience.</p>
<p>"Well, after all, why should it surprise us? Haven't we Aunt
Agatha as an awful example of the power of moral principle?"</p>
<p>"But she was a perfect lady, though fallen; and perfect ladies
do not exist any longer except as perpetual ruins or specimens of
primitive art."</p>
<p>"It all comes of the way girls run about by themselves," Mrs.
Burden lamented. "I always said that short skirts and silk
stockings would end in immorality. But I don't reproach myself
for Milly's wildness any more than I do for Alfred's desertion of
me. I told them both I had a right to know where they went; but I
could never make them see what they owed to me. Nobody can say
that I haven't always done the best that I could; but the more I
told Alfred it was his Christian duty to love me, the more he
seemed to go wrong out of pure contrariness. And it's the same
with Milly now. Whenever I try to make her feel proper remorse,
she tells me that if I enjoy remorse so much, I may have her
share of it, too."</p>
<p>"It seems to me, my dear lady," Mr. Littlepage admonished
gently, "that you persist in taking too hopeless a view. I
understand the shock Milly's misfortune must have been to you.
But you must make allowances for a world at war and the agitated
condition of the public mind."</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden looked at him with opaque conviction. "It would
take more than a world at war to make me forget my behaviour,
sir."</p>
<p>"I am sure of that, Mrs. Burden. Nevertheless, you must
remember that standards are less severe than they were in our
youth. Is it possible," he inquired in amazement, since he was
still young enough and open-minded enough for surprise, "that you
wish Milly to be dealt with more harshly?"</p>
<p>"It isn't what I wish, Mr. Littlepage, but what is right. I
can't reconcile it with my religion not to feel repentance for
sin."</p>
<p>"Nothing," Marmaduke commented gleefully, "short of eternal
damnation will satisfy her."</p>
<p>"I was just telling your brother when you came in," Mrs.
Burden whispered to Mr. Littlepage, "that there are few things
too sacred for him to make fun of. It's living so long in Europe,
I suppose, that has given him his loose way with morals."</p>
<p>"You must not believe all that he tells you, Mrs. Burden. But
it seems to my unregenerate mind that the first consideration is
your daughter's welfare."</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden set her thin lips so tightly that they dwindled to
a lavender slit. "Her eternal welfare, Mr. Littlepage."</p>
<p>"You can't mean, my good lady, that you wish to see her suffer
on earth?"</p>
<p>"It isn't that I wish to see her suffer on earth, sir. But
I've kept the fear of the Lord in my heart, though so many others
have lost it. Doesn't the Bible warn us that there is no
salvation for the sinner except through repentance?"</p>
<p>"And what does Milly reply to all this?"</p>
<p>"What she says, sir, is that her life is her own, and she has
no regrets."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned. "Such talk is little more than the
froth and bubble that is spilled over from modern psychology," he
rejoined, with authority.</p>
<p>"We didn't talk like that when I was young. Then we were
taught to call sin death, not life, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, labels change even more rapidly than ideas. I confess
that I am an old-fashioned man in many ways, and, like you, I
find it difficult to move with the times when they appear to be
slipping downhill. However, Marmaduke will tell you that the
world is better off because it has discarded moral shams."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't like to take my views of life, sir, from an
artist, especially from an artist who is so familiar with
undraped figures."</p>
<p>"I respect your delicacy, dear madam, but remember that, even
if Marmaduke is a scoffer, he left his best leg in the war
zone."</p>
<p>"I am not begging indulgence for folly," Marmaduke
interrupted. "I am only asking you to observe that by the time
the worst of us have finished with life, we have suffered enough
to pacify even Mrs. Burden's deity. Why in the world can't you
both leave the poor girl alone?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden choked audibly before she could gather her breath
for a reply. "You forget, Mr. Marmaduke, that I am her mother! Is
there anybody who has a better right than a mother to a girl's
confidence? I asked her this very question last night, and all
she answered was that you knew her better than I did."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm not sure that I don't, Mrs. Burden. After all,
there are stronger ties than the umbilical cord."</p>
<p>"Be careful, Marmaduke!" Mr. Littlepage warned sharply; for it
seemed to him that his brother was becoming ribald in language.
"It isn't fair to torment her when you can't turn her an
inch."</p>
<p>"I am not thinking of her, but of Milly. Hasn't the poor child
been through enough?"</p>
<p>Picking up the coffee-tray as firmly as if it were a moral
principle, Mrs. Burden departed without the sacrifice of her
dignity.</p>
<p>"There are occasions, Marmaduke," Mr. Littlepage observed
sternly, "when I should think twice before calling you a Southern
gentleman."</p>
<p>"Well, I've accomplished that much!" Marmaduke retorted, with
all the airiness that could be expected of a man who stood on one
leg and even less reputation. Leaning heavily on his crutch, he
moved to the window and gazed, with the eyes of a caged hawk, at
the mournful horizon, where the autumn twilight was floating down
like a blue shawl. "God in heaven, these good women!" he
exclaimed under his breath.</p>
<p>"They are not all like that, Marmaduke. Mrs. Burden, I think,
is an antiquated survival. There was our mother, for example, and
there is Victoria."</p>
<p>"But look at Aunt Agatha. Life imprisonment, nothing less. A
free spirit condemned to perpetual captivity in a ruin."</p>
<p>Put like that, Mr. Littlepage was obliged to admit that poor
Aunt Agatha's story sounded depressing. "It was unfortunate," he
said, "but you must remember that grandfather died of a broken
heart over Aunt Agatha's disgrace."</p>
<p>To Mr. Littlepage's horror Marmaduke answered with a whistle
of incredulity. "Well, I like his nerve," he exclaimed in the
idiom of the streets which his brother abhorred, "when you recall
the gay bird he had been in his youth."</p>
<p>"Standards were different then. Even mother, who had the
tenderest heart in the world, never felt that Aunt Agatha had
been treated too harshly. I confess that the idea never entered
my mind until I married Victoria."</p>
<p>"Yes, I take off my hat to Victoria," Marmaduke replied
generously. "If she always thinks the wrong thing, she never
fails, except by accident, to do the right one. The truth is,
though we seldom agree in our opinions, that Victoria and I are
the only pair of genuine idealists left alive."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage smiled. "An unmatched pair, you must
admit."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. Not so unmatched, however, as you might suppose. The
point we have in common is that we are both genuine. We are
neither of us so beautiful as Mary Victoria nor so intelligent as
Louisa Goddard; but we are more real as far as we go, which
isn't, I grant you, so far as it might be. Our only difference
arises when Victoria fails to accept the greatest modern
discovery that nothing we do or say matters to the universe. She
has never lost the primitive belief that the cosmos is her
audience."</p>
<p>"Is there any reverence left in your nature, Marmaduke?"</p>
<p>"Very little. No genuine idealist who isn't as simple-minded
as Victoria could reverence the conspiracy of evasion you
optimists call civilization. Only a materialist like Mary
Victoria is capable of that kind of duplicity."</p>
<p>"Whatever you hold against Mary Victoria," Mr. Littlepage
rejoined tartly, "you must admit that she is, with all her
faults, an idealist."</p>
<p>"On the contrary," Marmaduke chuckled, "she is as
materialistic as big business or organized Christianity. Have you
forgotten the way she patronized the war as if it were her
favourite charity?"</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage looked away and pondered the question.</p>
<p>"She wasn't alone in that attitude," he replied presently.
"You were abroad so long that I don't suppose you realize the
effect of war work upon Aunt Agatha. She had positively a second
blooming in the Red Cross."</p>
<p>Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders after the French fashion,
which Virginius had always disliked. "Well, you can't blame her.
It was the woman's year of jubilee. I, for one, don't hold that
against women. The only thing I resent is the sacred fallacy that
they dislike war. What they really dislike is the war that they
haven't a finger in because it is saving some other stronghold of
civilization."</p>
<p>"It is impossible to argue with you," Virginius returned, with
more dignity than conviction. Unhappily, he could not deny that
all the women of his acquaintance had been thrilled, at least in
the beginning, by the long reverberations of the Great War.
Mothers who lost sons were naturally an exception; but he had
remarked that even mothers who lost sons were inspired, if not
consoled, by the popular superstition that heaven lies within the
shadow of the crossing swords, and that death in battle possesses
some mysterious sanctity which is absent from the most heroic
death in peace. For example, he knew that he himself (as well as
Victoria and Aunt Agatha and Louisa Goddard, who worked
untiringly in peace to discover the cause of war) considered big
guns and poison gas inadequate means of settling an argument, and
regarded all wars as barbarous, except the Civil War and the
Spanish War, about which he had had his doubts, and the Great
War, which was fought not only to end war, but to preserve a
moral ideal. Yes, he could not forget that he, in company with
all the other inhabitants of Queenborough (not including the few
disreputable pacifists to whom they stopped speaking), had
unanimously disapproved of all other wars as passionately as they
approved of the one righteous war they were immediately
waging.</p>
<p>"Don't imagine that I reproach the women," Marmaduke repeated.
"The prime advantage of living in a decadent period is that you
are able to shoulder your own infirmities, and are not obliged to
hold either God or the devil responsible. All we have to do is to
reconcile ourselves to alternate attacks of civilization and
savagery; and in the interlude between two righteous wars to end
war, while we are recovering our exhausted idealism, it doesn't
do any harm to invent one more benevolent pretence."</p>
<p>"Well, it is a comfort to reflect that you are as inconsistent
as the rest of us," Virginius replied sadly, for Marmaduke's
views, though, of course, unsound in principle, were in some
sinister fashion impervious to logic. "If you had lived up to
your pessimistic doctrines, you would have remained abroad
instead of returning to Queenborough. Certainly, you would not
have wished to marry Louisa. It seems that you have preserved
that one ideal, anyway."</p>
<p>Tossing his cigarette into the fire, Marmaduke shuffled over
to a cupboard in the corner and picked out his last bottle of
Bourbon. "I've still enough left for two high balls," he said
slowly. Returning to the table, he measured out precisely two
equal parts of whisky, while he listened gravely to his brother's
reproachful, "Merely a thimbleful, Marmaduke. I'll bring you a
bottle of old Baumgartner to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Louisa isn't an ideal. She is a habit," was Marmaduke's only
comment. "And no ideal is so obstinate as a habit."</p>
<p>"I should think by this time you would have become hopeless
about her."</p>
<p>"Never until I see signs in her of weakening moral fibre. I
have got into the habit of unattainable desire. It is the only
permanent force left in the perpetual flux of my universe."</p>
<p>"But suppose she should ever relent?"</p>
<p>"She won't. Make your mind easy. There is nothing in it for
her. Louisa is wedded to her importance as indissolubly as I am
wedded to an unattainable desire. Don't, I beg you, seek to
divorce either of us. We are both well mated in life."</p>
<p>Sipping his whisky and soda, Virginius mused despondently,
"Yes, I must bring Marmaduke a bottle to-morrow. He was always an
improvident fellow. Another man would have saved his last
high-ball. A generous fellow, indeed. Too generous for his own
advantage, though neither sound in his opinions nor reputable in
his associations. Yet he must have enjoyed life. On the whole, he
must have enjoyed life more than I have." A pulsation, which
might have been, but was not, a spasm of envy, stirred the
slumbering buccaneer in the decorous soul of Mr. Littlepage. "The
difference is," he thought consolingly, "that I was faithful to
my ideals--or was it merely to my pretences?--while Marmaduke let
nothing stand in the way of delight. I chose wealth, security,
steadfast position, but Marmaduke gave all those things in
exchange for liberation of spirit. He has been himself, however
ignoble." Long ago, he remembered, in his first youth, he also
had craved liberty, but it was always some liberty of to-morrow
or the day after. "Next year, or when the children are grown. Or
perhaps after I have established a fortune. Then I shall take my
fling before it is too late to enjoy freedom." But Marmaduke, he
saw with disapproving envy, had not compromised, had not waited
for the opportune moment. He was shabby and untidy and
disreputable, but he was also a free spirit. He had never been
twisted into a conventional shape. "Isn't there at least a grain
of truth in his charges?" Virginius asked himself gloomily. "I've
spent all my life trying to conform to other people's ideals.
Fear, not ambition, has been the mainspring of my character. Fear
of the stock market, fear of public opinion, fear, most of all,
of what people would think of me." Aloud he remarked, "Of course,
you are an artist. Nobody expects much in the way of character
from an artist. But my position was different. A lawyer is
obliged to build up a reputation for integrity."</p>
<p>"Well, integrity is a fine thing, whatever you mean by it.
Now, my integrity consists in being true to my own nature."</p>
<p>"And mine has been exactly the opposite. Integrity for me has
meant being true to what other people expect of me."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see it in your face." After draining his glass,
Marmaduke picked up the empty bottle and surveyed it with a
mournful expression. "You are easily frightened, Virginius. Not
that I blame you when I think how your nerves must have suffered
in the artificial life you have led. Artificial conformity is, I
believe, at the bottom of the chronic dyspepsia among American
men. How can you digest your meals when you live in a protracted
panic, and your whole philosophy of life is rooted in the fear of
women? Rabbit souls, you are afraid of a shadow. That is why you
are so eager to escape into the stock market or into a war, which
is the only complete escape from civilization. Good Lord! But I
don't wonder. I'd escape that way myself if I were imprisoned in
this woman-ruled society. After making a republic, you men have
not had sufficient courage to keep what you had won from women,
who know nothing of freedom because they have embraced sacrifice
as an ideal. And you are still too cowed to realize that you have
turned the American Republic into an oligarchy of maternal
instincts. For the belief in sacrifice is so firmly embedded in
the minds of women that freedom means little more to them than an
extended area of reform. Already they have obliterated the
distinction between a willing and an unwilling martyrdom. It is
only human, you must admit, that after centuries of successful
self-sacrifice they should seize with genuine enthusiasm an
opportunity to sacrifice the other half of the world. So complete
a reversal of the situation doesn't often occur in human
affairs."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage rose stiffly. Not only were his deepest
convictions affronted, but his academic mind, subdued by the
prevalent habits of tight thinking and loose living, resented
bitterly what he regarded as an attack upon womanhood. Moreover,
he told himself sternly, there were occasions when Marmaduke
proved that a Southern gentleman who had lived abroad could
become as obnoxious as any Turk.</p>
<p>"It is useless to remind you," he said sharply, "that some of
us have retained a sense of moral obligation."</p>
<p>"My dear Virginius! Am I not reminded of it every time I feel
a hopeless desire for Louisa? Am I not reminded every time I look
at Milly Burden that Mary Victoria has preserved a sense of moral
obligation?"</p>
<p>A look of distress darkened Mr. Littlepage's bright brown
eyes. "I am deeply troubled," he confessed anxiously. "I can't
rid myself of the feeling that in some way I am responsible. If I
had told Mary Victoria the whole truth, she might never have
married him."</p>
<p>"Ease your mind of that worry, Virginius. Nothing could have
saved that poor devil after he once put himself in the way of
Mary Victoria's sense of duty."</p>
<p>"You must not think that I judge her so harshly, Marmaduke. I
have confidence enough in her character to feel sure that she
acted from a noble--yes, from an unselfish motive. What I can't
get over is the way this consummate cad has worked upon the
child's belief that she was saving his life."</p>
<p>"Well, I am not so certain that her belief required working
upon. Mary Victoria seems to know her own mind--or morals--as
thoroughly as any woman I ever encountered. What she
craves--though I am not sure that she herself is aware of it--is
complete domination of the world within reach of her influence.
The wider her sphere of inspiration becomes, the more flattering
it is to her vanity. And vanity, if you will pardon my
irreverence, is the controlling interest in most feminine efforts
to improve the nature of man. Now, Mary Victoria--"</p>
<p>"I cannot listen to this, Marmaduke. It is not Mary Victoria's
fault that she is one of those women who inspire men."</p>
<p>"That is exactly what I am trying to tell you. Don't imagine
for a moment that I blame her for being herself. I know as well
as you do that inspirations, like village idiots, are born, not
made. After all, human nature has not changed since we were
young. Only the horizon, not the outlook, has become
broader."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage's mild expression stiffened into a frown. "I
sometimes think, Marmaduke, that you hold no sentiment above
ridicule."</p>
<p>"If you complained that I hold no age above ridicule, you
would be nearer the truth. I am, I hope, a citizen of
eternity."</p>
<p>"Then you have a longer span than most of us. All I seek to
do," said Mr. Littlepage, and he meant it, "is not to fall below
the standards of the age in which I am living. If we still
cherish a sincere reverence for womanhood, as I prefer to think
we do in Queenborough, it is because we have kept our
institutions free from contamination. Nothing, for my part, has
given me greater pleasure than the earnestness with which Mary
Victoria implanted American ideals in the Balkans. General
Clintocksy told me on Armistice Day that she was a beautiful
embodiment of the American spirit. A saving influence, he called
her."</p>
<p>"And yet you are astonished when the influence summons her to
save young Welding." Marmaduke's satirical tone softened. "Has it
ever occurred to you, Virginius, that you are a bit of a fool? I
suppose it is too soon to prophesy; but in the end you may find
that the Great War has demolished you and your last scarecrow of
aristocratic tradition. A class without tradition but with a
plebeian appetite for corn is already swarming over your
field."</p>
<p>Virginius rose in silence and slipped into his overcoat. A few
hours before he would not have believed that he could feel such
intense irritation at the sound of Marmaduke's voice. "He holds
dangerous views, especially about sex," he thought with
indignation. "I wonder if I ought to warn Mrs. Burden that he is
an undesirable associate for her daughter."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c112" id="c112">XII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Outside, in the dusk, his resentment cooled while he reminded
himself of his father, who had been menaced by a stroke of
apoplexy whenever his opinion was challenged. It was, he felt,
proof of an unbalanced temper to take Marmaduke seriously. Only
in the last few years, since the end of the war, had he become
morbidly sensitive to such ridicule. And not only Marmaduke but
Victoria and Louisa and Duncan and Curle had, each in a different
way, begun to wear on his nerves. An obscure emotion, rustling
like dark wings in the twilight, fluttered across his usually
sanguine mind. Pausing on the brow of the hill, he looked, beyond
the sombre canal and the Stark chimneys, to the faint glimmer of
mother-of-pearl in the sky. At the moment, his own disenchantment
with life was engulfed in a sense of universal futility. "Where
is it driving us? What is the meaning of it all?" he thought
vaguely. "Yes, I've missed it. Whatever it was that would have
meant happiness, I have missed it in life." Yet he did not know
what this fulfilment was that he had desired more than all else,
and had lost without ever possessing. Was it merely that, with
the rest of mankind, he had missed the ephemeral flower of
delight? He had had, it is true, other blessings. All the favours
that society holds in esteem had been his without effort. Honour
among men, wealth, love--yes, he supposed he had had love--but
joy he had never known in its fulness. He had had his years or
his seasons, but never his moments. For delight, he realized with
a flash of vision, lives only in moments. It is as fugitive as
the wings of a butterfly, and as flamelike in colour. It has no
years; it has no seasons; for it is circumscribed by the spirit
alone. "Well, it is too late now," he thought, without
bitterness. "It is too late now with this heavy load on my
shoulders, and, even if I have missed happiness, I have accepted
my obligations. I have been a good citizen and a faithful
husband. I have never shirked my public duty, and I have been
able to make Victoria happy."</p>
<p>Turning away, with this consoling thought in his mind, he
crossed the street and ran against Milly Burden as she flitted
out from the darkness into light at the corner. For the second
time in one evening she had changed almost miraculously; and
while he gazed at her starry eyes and flushed cheeks, he asked
himself in astonishment if the human heart could be more elastic
to-day than it was when he was young and a lover? Her step was
light, her smile was defiant, and there was the softness of a
carnation bloom on her lips. It occurred to him that women,
especially women he had thought of as fragile, had acquired a
tremendous power of recovery. Even if the passion of love had not
altered, it appeared to have lost, in a measure at least, its
finality.</p>
<p>"You look as if you'd made a fresh start in life, Milly," he
said approvingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I have. I've made a fresh start."</p>
<p>"You must go straight ahead. Put the past out of your mind.
After all, there isn't anything to worry about now. It depends
upon you whether your life shall be ruined or not."</p>
<p>"Well, it shan't be ruined. Isn't that right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is right, but you mustn't be hard."</p>
<p>She laughed, and in spite of the effervescent sparkle in her
face, he told himself that there was bitterness in her heart.
"Oh, but it feels so nice to be hard! If I had known how nice it
felt, I should have been hard all my life."</p>
<p>"That sounds as if you had not put the past out of your
mind."</p>
<p>"But I have put it out. I have put it out of my mind and out
of my reach. That is why I couldn't stay at home to-night and
watch Mother reading the Bible. I've wasted too much time. Life
goes before you know it, and then you're sorry for all the time
you've wasted. I want to get all the pleasure I can before it is
over and done with."</p>
<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, anywhere! Anywhere is better than staying at home. I
don't want ever to think again. I'm never, never, never going to
think again."</p>
<p>"But you will, my dear. This mood won't last." Where in modern
youth, he wondered regretfully, was the proverbial softness of
the feminine nature? Where was the clinging modesty of all the
lost but lovely ladies in Victorian novels? For an instant, he
was afflicted by the vision of poor Aunt Agatha swooning in her
"polonaise" upon a mahogany soft, upholstered in horsehair, while
her stern but merciful family bathed her forehead with camphor
and forced a dose of sal volatile between her trembling lips.
Only a little while ago, it seemed to him now. Yet here was Milly
before him, neither clinging nor soft. Yes, customs had changed,
was not morality still as invincible as it had appeared in his
youth? Were there, as the consecrated verdict of the past had
decided, right and wrong ideas of conduct? Were there right and
wrong habits of thinking? Were there right and wrong ways of
behaving? Were there, indeed, right and wrong manners?</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten that this is Sunday, Milly?" he asked
gently. "You won't find anything open but churches."</p>
<p>"Well, there is out of doors, isn't there?"</p>
<p>"Not at night. You can't run about by yourself after
dark."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Oh, I shan't run about. I'll go somewhere, if
it's only to church. I can stand church better than Mother."</p>
<p>"But your mother may be there."</p>
<p>"I shan't go to that one." Her voice was so mocking that he
asked himself if she was merely deriding him? "I'm looking for
pleasure."</p>
<p>"That's a dangerous search, my dear."</p>
<p>"Not when you don't really believe in it. Nothing is
dangerous, not even love, when you don't really believe in
it."</p>
<p>"You will believe in it again, never fear."</p>
<p>"Not in love. Oh, never in love again. In pleasure, perhaps,
but not in love--not, at least, in the kindness of love."</p>
<p>With a start, he remembered Mrs. Dalrymple. Were all women, at
least all frail women, alike? And did all women, firm or frail,
value loving-kindness more deeply than love?"</p>
<p>"Some day you may find both together. You are very young."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Can you find what you don't believe
in?"</p>
<p>"I am not sure, but you'll find your faith again."</p>
<p>"I am not looking for faith. I have given up happiness, but
even when you've given up happiness, pleasure is left."</p>
<p>"Be careful, Milly, be careful."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll be careful. I'll be so careful that I shall never
again mistake pleasure for love." They had reached the corner;
and for an instant before parting, she looked up at him with a
smile that was mocking, ironic, defiant, and mysteriously
desolate. Then, after the lightest touch on his arm, she opened a
gate and ran quickly up the steps of a house.</p>
<p>"I'd give my right arm if it hadn't happened," he thought
miserably. "I'd give almost as much if I had never written that
letter to Mary Victoria. The truth is that the world has never
been fair to women. Men have never been fair to women." Looking
straight overhead, he saw a bright and clement star shining
through the powdery bloom of the dusk. The star reminded him of
the lost sweetness of life, and the lost sweetness of life
reminded him of Mrs. Dalyrmple. Suddenly, with one of those swift
alternations of mood, which were, he told himself, the best
survival of youth, he felt hopeful again, he felt hopeful and
young and expectant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="p02" id="p02">PART II</a></h1>
<h1>MRS. LITTLEPAGE</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c201" id="c201">I</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>In her upstairs sitting-room, which was the brightest and most
private room in the house, Mrs. Littlepage was discussing the
situation, as she discussed every event in life, with Louisa
Goddard. From one of the four long windows, where a canary in a
gilded cage was tunefully greeting the day, a band of pale
sunshine streamed in a border of filmy lace over the
maroon-coloured carpet. Louisa's chair was placed in the middle
of the sunshine, and delicate fringes of light waved over her
narrow hat of black satin and splintered back from her
eyeglasses.</p>
<p>"I hated to bother you, Victoria," she was saying, while she
inserted a programme into a large yellow envelope, "but the
proper handling of child material seems to be the most important
subject before us."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage, who was looking pale and very tired, nodded
with her smile of unselfish goodness. "Nothing, of course, is
more important," she assented, and thought wearily of Mary
Victoria. Her face, which Louisa had admired and loved since
childhood, was graver and nobler than usual, and the lips she
pressed firmly together showed a bluish tinge in the
sunlight.</p>
<p>"Are you ill, Victoria?" her friend asked anxiously. "Is it
time for your digitalis?"</p>
<p>Victoria shook her head; while a lock of greying hair slipped
down over her clear forehead and the smooth pale curve of her
cheek, which had the softness of old velvet. "Not yet. There is
nothing to worry about, Louisa." She paused, moistened her dry
lips, and added slowly, "I have decided to say nothing to
Virginius about my illness."</p>
<p>"Are you sure that is wise, dear?"</p>
<p>"It would only make him anxious and unhappy. He would be
afraid to ask me to lift a finger, and it would be the same way
with the children. It would mean spreading my death over months
instead of hours. Besides, I haven't the strength for emotional
scenes. Since Mary Victoria's return, I feel that I have less
strength than ever. I find any agitation exhausting."</p>
<p>Taking Victoria's large, soft hand, Louisa held it against her
cheek while her eyes filled slowly with tears. "I am sorry the
doctor told you, Victoria."</p>
<p>"But I knew it, you see. Mother died that way, and I knew all
the symptoms. When my first heart attack came after that spell of
pneumonia, I knew at once what it meant. Of course, he tried to
deceive me; but I was so sure that I had only a little while
longer to live that at last he told me the truth. It wasn't as if
it had been such a terrible shock. My chief fear was that
Virginius and the children might find it out. I did not wish to
spoil their winter."</p>
<p>"But Dr. Buchanan said you might live for years."</p>
<p>"Yes, he told me so, but I am sure he didn't believe it."</p>
<p>"Oh, dearest, why not?"</p>
<p>Victoria sighed. "I can't explain even to you, Louisa. You
see, I went through it all with my mother, though Dr. Buchanan
declares that there's nothing in the idea of heredity. He says
that my having the same kind of heart attacks is merely a
coincidence--"</p>
<p>"He must know," Louisa interrupted emphatically. "That is his
speciality."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose he knows, but something tells me that he is
mistaken."</p>
<p>"Isn't it only that you allow yourself to take a depressing
view?"</p>
<p>Again Victoria moistened her lips before she answered. Though
she had grown heavier in figure since her illness, it seemed to
Louisa that she had never recovered her look of abundant but
sober vitality. For one thing the colour of her complexion had
altered, and the vivid bloom in her cheeks had divided into tiny
veins which were duller and tinged with purple. Even her eyes
looked tired under the full white lids, with their pale lashes,
and there were drooping lines besides her fine straight nose and
at the corners of her mouth, which had not lost its serene smile.
"Her expression is so lovely that it is not easy to tell how she
is feeling," Louisa thought, holding Victoria's hand. "With a
smile like hers, it doesn't matter even whether you are beautiful
or plain."</p>
<p>"No, I haven't really felt depressed," Victoria was saying
gently. "That is the strangest thing that has happened, and there
isn't anyone but you in the world who could understand what I am
trying to tell you. I never wished to die. I always thought,
indeed, that it would be a shock to find out I had only a little
while longer to live. Yet, now that it has really happened, it
doesn't seem to make very much difference. It is so queer that I
can't even try to explain it. I am so tired that it takes all the
strength that I have left just to try to keep Virginius and the
children from discovering the truth. That is the only thing I
worry about. Every bit of my energy goes into pretending that I
am better and trying not to spoil their winter before I am
obliged to give up. I go on day after day just as if I were in
the midst of a great tumult, a terrible soundless noise, and were
waiting for it to stop."</p>
<p>"I have always said that you were too unselfish, Victoria."
Releasing her friend's hand, Louisa found a handkerchief in her
bag and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>Victoria shook her head. "I am not sure that it is
unselfishness, Louisa. The truth is that things never seemed as
important to me as to other people. Life has never seemed too
important. Often, when I gave up my pleasures as a girl and was
praised for unselfishness, it meant simply that my wishes were
not strong enough for me to make an effort about them. Sometimes
I think I was born inert rather than active. I don't mean that I
haven't been happy; but even happiness has never seemed so
important to me. I've had a perfect marriage, and I think
Virginius has never missed anything. The chief satisfaction in my
life is the feeling that I have made Virginius happy--" Checking
herself abruptly, she caught her lower lip between her teeth. Not
even to Louisa could she confess that there had been moments,
there had been hours, when she had longed for something more
satisfying than any love Virginius was able to give.</p>
<p>"You have, my dearest." Louisa was crying into her
handkerchief. "You have been a perfect wife to Virginius. No man
has ever been happier." Wiping her eyes briskly, she added in a
more cheerful tone while she polished her glasses, "If only you
could convince yourself that Dr. Buchanan is right and you may
yet live for years."</p>
<p>Victoria smiled and patted her friend's arm. "Well, perhaps he
is. Even that doesn't seem so very important to me. What I mind
most is this noise all about me--this noise that you can't hear
with your ears, if you know what I mean. It is the loudest kind
of confusion, and yet I know that it has no actual sound, that it
has no actual existence. Some day, I suppose, it will have to
stop."</p>
<p>"Of course it will stop, dear. It is nothing but your
imagination."</p>
<p>"That is what Dr. Buchanan says, but I know better. I have so
little imagination, you see, that I could never have invented a
tumult like this. Do you know," she continued, smiling into the
glitter of Louisa's eyeglasses, "I have at moments a ridiculous
feeling that the tumult is all in some other dimension, that
something beyond time and space is trying to reach me."</p>
<p>Louisa looked at her closely. "But you never felt the
slightest interest in such things."</p>
<p>"I am not interested now. I am merely wondering how long this
soundless noise will go on."</p>
<p>"Perhaps if the doctor gave you a sedative?"</p>
<p>"He has been giving me bromide, but I sleep well enough. The
only thing that keeps me awake is anxiety about Mary
Victoria."</p>
<p>"Her marriage may turn out better than we expect," Louisa
rejoined, but her tone was far from emphatic. "Have you heard
anything more to Martin's discredit?"</p>
<p>"Only what Virginius told us. He blames himself bitterly for
his share in the matter."</p>
<p>"I hoped, dear, that he would not tell you."</p>
<p>"It disturbed him so much that he could not keep it to
himself. We are making every effort now to save Mary Victoria's
happiness. But we both feel distressed about that other girl. Far
worse, indeed, because she has no family to protect her."</p>
<p>"Then it is Milly Burden," Louisa said slowly. "I suspected as
much."</p>
<p>"That is why Virginius feels it so deeply."</p>
<p>Louisa, who had a frugal though not a narrow mind, gazed at
her with sympathy. "It must have been a great sorrow to
Virginius. Do you know, I sometimes wonder how he could have
lived to be fifty-seven and practised law for more than thirty
years, and yet never have lost his illusions."</p>
<p>Victoria smiled tenderly. "I cannot be too grateful that I
married a man who hasn't that other side to his nature."</p>
<p>"I am sure that no man could have less of it," Louisa
rejoined. "You know, without my telling you, that there isn't
anybody in the world I admire more than Virginius. But, just
because he is so free from the weaknesses of other men, do you
think he may have been a little unjust to Mary Victoria's
husband?"</p>
<p>For a moment Victoria brooded over the idea. Then crossing the
room she searched in her desk for a memorandum she had promised
to give Curle at lunch. "I am not entirely satisfied about that,"
she replied presently, while Louisa observed, as she had done so
often before, that Victoria's slightest gesture had a royal air
of command, of grave decision, of effortless virtue. "Mary
Victoria says only that he had never known the right kind of
woman until he met her." A shadow flitted, without settling,
across her serene features. "After all, what is the right kind of
woman? And why should any kind of woman be responsible for the
moral sense of a man?"</p>
<p>Louisa glowed with admiration. "I have always said, Victoria,
that you are too broad-minded to be a woman."</p>
<p>"Well, why shouldn't women be as broad-minded as men?"</p>
<p>"I don't know why, but they are not. They are
not--usually."</p>
<p>"Well, you are, Louisa, and I am delighted to see that your
fine example is felt more and more every year in this
community."</p>
<p>The flush in Louisa's face spread upward to the waving line of
grey hair. She had worked hard to attain her intellectual
eminence, and she had reached the sanguine period of life when a
tribute to her mind was as much enjoyed as a compliment to her
appearance. Though she had little exact knowledge, that little
was an elastic measure, and could be stretched, with thinning
substance, over a variety of unfamiliar topics. Versatility
combined with the manner of authority had elevated her to a
position in the mental life of Queenborough which sound learning
and a vast accumulation of knowledge could not have attained. The
ease with which her well-oiled mind turned from antique manners
to contemporary mannerless youth was respected in an epoch which
would have preferred to order its culture, as it ordered its
Battle Creek health foods, from the most convenient
green-grocer.</p>
<p>"It is like you to say that, Victoria," she responded
gratefully, but with proper dignity. "You know that I could never
have become what I am to-day without your friendship. I cannot
begin to tell you what you and Virginius have meant to me."
Choked by emotion, she glanced down at the large yellow envelope
as if it were some mysterious talisman of success. Then,
recovering herself with an effort, while her thin throat worked
convulsively beneath the band of black velvet ribbon, she asked
slowly, "You are sure, then, that Virginius has not been--well,
the least bit unjust?"</p>
<p>"Nobody could be fairer than Virginius; but you know how vague
he becomes when you try to get anything out of him."</p>
<p>Yes, Louisa knew. She had had her disappointments in life, and
she was inclined, moreover, to place masculine vagueness among
the minor trials of a woman's lot.</p>
<p>"All lawyers are secretive, I suppose," she remarked, "and
Mary Victoria is still too much in love to be just, even if she
knew the whole truth."</p>
<p>"She is still seraphic, poor child. Almost too much so, I
sometimes tell myself; but girls in this age are far less
reserved than we used to be. I should never have dreamed of
putting my hand on Virginius before other people, except of
course when I was obliged to take his arm in the street. That is
why, I suppose, I can't get used to seeing Mary Victoria more
demonstrative in public than I could ever have been even in
private. Virginius cannot bear to watch them embrace each other
so openly. He told me yesterday that he sometimes thought the
worst man was more modest than the best woman. It is impossible
for him to understand that such freedom is merely the trend of
the age."</p>
<p>"Certainly, it is the trend of the age," assented Louisa, who
was an authority upon trends, ancient and modern, and had found
them to be of inestimable value in the dissemination of culture.
Ancient trends were naturally more instructive because they were
less pushing than modern ones, but all were equally useful as
warning examples. Never, indeed, in an historical survey, which,
though adequate to her purpose, was brisk rather than thorough,
had she been able to discover a trend that moved in a proper
direction. All flowed, however rapidly or sluggishly, over an
immovable obstacle, which was revealed by the ebbing tide of
progress as a bulwark of the best minds. Take, for instance, this
bold modern trend towards loose behaviour in love. To Louisa, who
was nothing if not compact in principle, and who disapproved of
looseness in any form, even in her attire, the present impetus
toward indecency appeared far less pronounced than similar trends
in Babylon (if you could judge a whole civilization by the biased
ejaculations of prophets) or even in Rome, where one could rely,
of course, upon the impregnable reputation of Gibbon.</p>
<p>"Surely it is needless to remind Virginius," she said
presently, still contrasting the old with the new improprieties,
"that Mary Victoria is never prompted by any but the highest
motives."</p>
<p>Victoria sighed. "He understands that--or, at least, I hope he
understands it. As I've told you so often, Mary Victoria has been
the romance of his life. No, I don't mean that he hasn't been a
perfect husband--only that there was something more than love in
his adoration of Mary Victoria. It was a blow to him when she
insisted upon going back to the Balkans. Though he said nothing
to dissuade her, I could tell that she felt he could not enter
into her motive."</p>
<p>"Well, she must feel it still more since her marriage."</p>
<p>"How can she help it? Why, to hear Virginius talk you would
imagine that he had never been in love in his life. But men are
like that," she added in a troubled tone.</p>
<p>"Yes, men are like that," Louisa agreed; and she continued
merrily, after a pause in which she retreated from the daylight
of history back into the grey dawn of evolution, "men and women
are so different that I sometimes wonder how they could have
sprung from the same trilobite."</p>
<p>"You would wonder more," Victoria rejoined, and she was not
smiling, "if you had ever married."</p>
<p>"I am not sure." Louisa looked at her attentively, "Sometimes
it seems to me that the spectator has a better perspective."</p>
<p>For she was an impartial observer rather than a censorious
critic of the institution of marriage; and she had learned to
sift her facts with the cool judgment and the ample leisure of
science. Virginius, in common with many other men who find
biology everywhere, even in such unlikely places as the minds of
confirmed spinsters, had confused the scientific spirit with a
repressed mating instinct. It is true that Louisa had a lively
curiosity on the subject of sex; but her inquisitiveness was that
of the mind alone. Her natural bias (had she not been singularly
free from moral infirmities) would have been in the direction of
avarice rather than impropriety. A guilty passion had always
appeared to her, indeed, to be the most overrated of pleasures.
To be sure, avarice was a less popular vice, and lent itself with
difficulty to the cinema or even to the more serious drama; but
in actual experience, you at least had something to show for it
after it was well over. With illicit love, on the contrary, she
had not failed to observe that its victims were frequently bereft
not only of lovers, but even of the ordinary comforts of life.
And, after all was said and done by romantics, it was impossible
to deny that the comforts of life were more sustaining in the end
than the most illegal of love affairs.</p>
<p>With a spring she rose and fastened the flaring collar of her
lambskin wool. Then, turning to the mirror, she slanted her hat
at the correct angle and adjusted her eyeglasses on the
aristocratic arch of her nose. "For my part," she concluded
indulgently, while she drew on her long grey gloves and picked up
the yellow envelope, "I have great sympathy for Mary Victoria.
Martin is very attractive, and it is easy to understand how she
was swept away by her feeling."</p>
<p>"Swept away by her feeling," Victoria repeated, sinking back
upon the flowered chintz of her couch. What did it mean, she
wondered idly, to be swept away from one's anchor, to be swept
out into the vast sunlit immensities of the universe? In all her
life of fifty-five years, never for an instant, never for a
single flaming point of time or eternity, had she forgotten
herself and her duty to others. Was it possible that she had
missed some finer essence of living, some purer distillation of
joy? Suppose she had once, only once in the cloudless innocence
of her youth, forgotten everything but delight. Suppose she had
lost herself for an instant only, as a swallow skims and sinks
and darts and curves and is lost, utterly lost, in the radiant
mist of the afterglow. Suppose Virginius, whom she had loved, had
not been Virginius at all, but the intrepid lover, the young
Lochinvar of the mind. There was a romantic and very silly dream
which had returned to her often as a girl and once again in her
young wifehood. While it lasted she had imagined herself to be in
the midst of an immense level plain, caught up suddenly into the
thunder of galloping horses. Far in the distance she had first
heard them approaching, while a liquid fire ran in her veins, and
she had asked herself, "Is it he? Is he coming at last?" Then, in
her sleep, she was lifted by an arm like the wind, and borne
away, with the wild horses, over the rustling broom-sedge, into a
sunset that was like the fire at the heart of an opal. Well, that
was only a dream. Outside of legend there were no young
Lochinvars left in the world, and all the wild horses, she
remembered with a pang, had been slaughtered. After the April
dream had come the bloomless actuality. After the young Lochinvar
of the mind had come the Southern gentleman as lover and husband.
Life, even at its best, was never what you had dreamed, was
seldom what you had expected. Never, in its imperfection, is it
woven of the dawn and dusk that is legend; never is it enkindled
with the burning sweetness of ecstasy. But she had been happy. It
was not fair to Virginius, she thought, to imagine that she had
missed something. It was not fair to Virginius to feel that
marriage, however perfect, had left some secret core of her being
still unsatisfied. "No, it is not fair to Virginius," she
repeated firmly. A dart of remorse stabbed through her when she
realized how hurt Virginius would be if he should ever discover
that, in the complete surrender of marriage, she had held
something back, that she had never yielded some inviolable
sanctity of the spirit.</p>
<p> </p>

<h1><a name="c202" id="c202">II</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>In the dining-room Mrs. Littlepage found Curle, who had a
punctual appetite though his manners at the table left much to
the imagination. Well, if he never did anything worse, she said
to herself, than bolt his food, there was sufficient cause to be
thankful. Even as a baby he had given her few anxious hours, and
for this reason, so illogical is the maternal heart, she had
always preferred Duncan, who had been from his protracted birth a
thorn in her bosom. For Duncan had quality, if he lacked
character, and quality more than any other virtue endeared a
human being to Victoria. In spite of the doleful cast of his
features and his habit of expecting the worst, which seemed to
make him an excellent prophet, he brightened the dullest room for
his mother as soon as he entered it. Though he was young and lean
and dark there were times when he reminded her of Marmaduke, who
was stout and elderly and grey. But, then, it was astonishing how
many dissimilar persons and objects reminded her of Marmaduke.
And this was the more amazing when she recalled that she
disapproved of Marmaduke as heartily as she could disapprove of a
member of the Littlepage family. Not that she had ever been
unjust to him. Not that she had ever failed to do her duty by
Virginius's brother, and indeed by all of them, including poor
Aunt Agatha, whom she had released, as far as she was able, from
a solitary confinement of genteel tradition. For it was Victoria
who had dragged poor Aunt Agatha out into the benign shelter of
the Red Cross and filled her nerveless hands with unmade pyjamas.
Yes, that one good thing at least, Mrs. Littlepage reflected, had
come out of the war. At sixty-five poor Aunt Agatha had actually
begun to put out a pale December blooming, and since the
armistice she had displayed this fresh moral weakness for moving
pictures. Taken all in all, Victoria decided, Aunt Agatha, in
spite of the outraged morality of her youth, was surpassed by
Marmaduke as a family trial in the present age. Was it possible
that morality had become less brittle? Or was it merely that a
sense of dishonour, like widow's weeds, had diminished in
quantity? Nobody, least of all Victoria, could begrudge the price
of moving pictures, or even of anything so indigestible as a
banana sundae. Yes, it was easy to feel benevolent toward poor
Aunt Agatha, and to dismiss her, without anxiety, as a case of
settled, if frivolous, regeneration. But Marmaduke, being
masculine, was a more difficult problem. He had, it was useless
to deny, the fatal personality that overflows, pervades, and
submerges. A poor painter, she had heard, in spite of his
pretensions (for can an artist who has never been able to make a
living, repeated incredulous Queenborough, be other than a poor
painter). Yet, poor and unrecognized, at least in Queenborough,
which was careful in matters of reputation, he was cheerful, he
was contented, he was even hilarious. "Strings are what make
trouble, my dear Victoria," he had said at their parting, "and
there are no strings to my soul. The sooner you and Virginius
break your strings, the happier you will be in the next
generation." As if she and Virginius were not happy together! As
if, except for Virginius's chronic dyspepsia and her double
pneumonia last winter, they were not the happiest married pair in
their own or Marmaduke's circle!</p>
<p>"I asked your uncle Marmaduke to lunch," she said now to
Curle, who was looking impatient, "but you can never depend on
him."</p>
<p>"We aren't waiting for him, are we?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, as soon as your father comes, we shall begin."</p>
<p>"Isn't father here yet?"</p>
<p>"No, he is a little late. Mary Victoria is using his car, and
she expected to stop by his office."</p>
<p>"I suppose she will pick up Martin at the same time. He
started in the bank to-day, didn't he? You can't say that he is
not trying to live up to Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am very much pleased by the way he has gone straight
to work. I imagined from the things he said to your father that
he might just sit down and expect us to provide for him. So many
writers are like that. It isn't," she continued thoughtfully, "as
if he wished to write wholesome books that would make the world
better. His ideas are all dreadfully morbid."</p>
<p>"Punk, that's what it is!" Curle chirped, while his mother
shivered as if the word had slapped her on the cheek. Why was it,
she asked herself, in sudden depression, that a sanguine
temperament so often overflowed into vulgar ejaculations? Curle,
she acknowledged gladly, was one of those fortunate natures who
live in perfect harmony with the temper and tone of their age;
and certainly he could not be blamed if the temper and tone of
the present sounded shrill and mechanical. Standing there in the
pale sunlight, which quivered like gauze over the dark red
curtains, the Duncan Phyfe dining-table, the old English silver
on the sideboard, and the rarest English mezzotints on the ivory
walls--standing there, against that decorous Virginian
background, Curle appeared, she told herself sadly, as inspiring
and almost as loud as a regimental band. Short, thick, freckled,
puffed up with optimism, and fairly bursting with public spirit,
he was the kind of man, she decided, who never fails to make a
poor lover and a good husband. The trouble was that so few women,
even among those who desire everything else, could possibly
desire Curle as lover or husband. Already, at twenty-eight, he
was making a conspicuous success in his business, which was real
estate; and he was engaged now in the project of dividing up some
old cornfields into avenues and boulevards. This daring exploit
had been magnified by owners of the local press (who happened to
own also several of the cornfields) into a brilliant achievement.
To the annoyance of Virginius, who had an old-fashioned distaste
for advertisement, Curle had sprung in a single season from
genteel poverty to vulgar success. Within the last few months,
since he had represented the wish-fulfilment of so many of his
fellow citizens, his opinions had been eagerly sought upon every
subject, from "the art of advertising" to the value of
Christianity as big business.</p>
<p>"I shall have to snatch a mouthful and run," he remarked,
drawing out his watch, a massive tribute to his ability from the
National Get Acquainted Club, a branch of which he had organized
in Virginia. "To Curle Littlepage," read the inscription, "one of
those public-spirited Virginians who are helping to make our
country what it is."</p>
<p>"Well, if they aren't here in five minutes, we'll sit down,"
she answered wearily. "There's the car now. I hope Mary Victoria
remembered to stop for your father."</p>
<p>Curle laughed while his mother shivered again. "As if Mary
Victoria ever forgot anything!"</p>
<p>"She never used to, I know. But since her marriage she has
seemed to me a little--well, just a very little inclined to be
casual."</p>
<p>"She's over head and ears in love, if that's what you mean.
However, take my word for it, that won't worry us long. Martin is
a good-looking chap, but if I know anything about men, and I
think I do, he lacks staying power."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage sighed again. "She thinks he is a genius."</p>
<p>The front door opened and shut; there was a stir in the hall,
an imperious step on the threshold; and Mary Victoria entered
with a streamer of sunlight from the French window. Erect, fair,
slender, in her knitted sport frock of pale green, she reminded
her sentimental mother of a tall golden lily in its sheath of
leaves. Yes, Mary Victoria was beautiful, too beautiful to have
married a man who was unworthy in character as well as
impoverished in circumstances. And it wasn't, of course, as if he
had distinguished himself in the war, which seemed to her, as
Marmaduke said, a flourishing hotbed of honours. It was true that
a renown for heroism did not last to-day as well as it once
lasted in the preserving fluid of Confederate memorials. Though
it was only five years since the Great War, Victoria had already
observed that glory, when it was not fortified by independent
means, was beginning to languish. Even in Queenborough where,
because of the military ideals of Southern gentlemen, the war had
achieved a great reputation, wealth was abolishing gallantry as a
title to fame. For the prosperous non-combatants were reluctant
to provide a living for the saviours of that democracy which had
been so well thought of while it was endangered. More than once,
she had reflected that a parade of heroes in Granite Boulevard
would melt away before a procession of millionaires; and that the
men who had saved our country would receive scant applause in the
presence of the men who were selling it. Yet, admitting that
prosperity, not patriotism, is the democratic road to renown, she
could not help regretting that Mary Victoria's husband had not so
much as a medal to show for his service. Even a foreign
decoration, which was as much, perhaps, as she ought to expect,
would have proved at least that he had known the right people.
But he had won no decoration; and though he was well-favoured,
even the bountiful Queen of Berengaria had overlooked him when
she distributed honours. Which only showed, Mrs. Littlepage
concluded, while she returned Mary Victoria's kiss, that in war
as in peace money is more important than anything else.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry we are late, Mother dear," Mary Victoria apologized
in her clear, fluting tones. "But Cousin Daniel wished to have a
talk with Martin."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter a bit, darling. Has everything been
arranged with Daniel?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, perfectly. I knew it would be all right with Cousin
Daniel as soon as I explained the situation. Of course, it isn't
the kind of work Martin prefers, but he is willing to take
anything for a start. After all, being in a bank is ever so much
better than the other place."</p>
<p>Martin, coming in immediately after her, looked fatigued but
admiring; and Mrs. Littlepage, who lacked temperament but had had
experience, wondered what would happen when fatigue at last
triumphed over admiration. Attractive in his way, she mused,
though she suspected that he was deficient in the qualities which
she called determination and strength of character, though Curle,
in his sprightly style, referred to them as "pluck and punch."
Nevertheless, she decided that she must drop a word of warning to
Mary Victoria; for even a weak man, especially when he is a
failure as well, will not stand too much driving.</p>
<p>"Cousin Daniel was really lovely about it," Mary Victoria
continued. "He was so glad to be able to give Martin a start in
Queenborough, and he was as sympathetic as he could be when I
told him of all our difficulties. I made him understand that
Martin will be obliged to go slowly at first because of his
illness."</p>
<p>"There is a great deal of good in Daniel," Mrs. Littlepage
remarked, as she sank into her chair and glanced down the long
table, with its delicate lace mats and glowing fruits and
flowers. "You must remember, too, that you have always been his
favourite."</p>
<p>"That's because I've tried to be nice to him," Mary Victoria
rejoined. "Mother, don't you think Martin had better sit by me so
I can keep an eye on him? You know the doctor at Vichy told me I
must watch his diet carefully until he is quite well again."</p>
<p>Martin was smiling vaguely, with the dazed and blinking
expression that came over him at moments, as if he had stumbled
from the darkness into too strong a glare. Was Mary Victoria
almost too much for him? Beautiful as she was, Mrs. Littlepage
would not have called her daughter "a restful person," and surely
Martin, with his harassed manner and burning eyes, looked as if
he needed rest even more than he required inspiration.</p>
<p>"I think, if you don't mind, I'd like to sit by Aunt Agatha,"
he said in a jesting tone. "She is so quiet."</p>
<p>For an instant Mrs. Littlepage stared at him, while she asked
herself anxiously if Mary Victoria had married a man who was not
quite right in his head? Since that fatal hour, in the early
'seventies, when she had yielded too much, no man had ever been
bold enough to solicit a favour from poor Aunt Agatha. No man,
indeed, had ever dared to approach her; for poor Aunt Agatha had
been a carefully guarded ruin, and Victoria was aware that
Southern gentlemen of the great tradition visited such ruins only
by moonlight. "Why, of course, you may sit by her," she answered
at last.</p>
<p>"Is there a new moving picture?" Curle asked in the indulgent
tone he used to the mentally or morally incompetent. Even when
they were small, Victoria had exacted that the children should
address at least one cheerful remark to poor Aunt Agatha at every
meal. Without turning her head, on which the silvery water waves
were plastered down above an unwrinkled forehead, Aunt Agatha
replied in an almost inaudible voice that she was going to a
picture palace at half-past two o'clock, but she had forgotten
the name of it.</p>
<p>While she answered, the idea crossed her still and shallow
mind that she had missed a great deal of pleasure by being born
at least fifty years too soon. Not that she envied either the
world or her sex this new liberty, which appeared to her, indeed,
to be sadly over-estimated. But an age in which no lady was too
frail to attend a play alone and soda-fountains occupied the
homes of a more masculine indulgence, seemed to her, on the
whole, better worth living in than the ceremonious era that had
witnessed her fall. Though she seldom thought about anything, and
would have chosen almost any other subject sooner than moralize
over her own tragedy, there were hours when, tirelessly knitting
baby blankets of pink wool, she would ask herself in the windy
emptiness that so often inflates a reformed character, if the
women of her generation had ever realized what the passing of
Victoria had meant to them?</p>
<p>While she sat now between Martin and Mary Victoria, mincing
her food after the fastidious manner of her girlhood, the
twilight vacancy of her mind was engulfed in a stifling fog from
the past. Out of this darkness, fragments of memory appeared for
an instant, whirling like wreckage strewn on the waves of a
torrent. "A lady always preferred the wing of a chicken when I
was young. Never the leg. It would have been indelicate to prefer
the leg, even if she called it dark meat. But now dark or light
makes no difference. She may prefer any part, even the pope's
nose, without being considered indelicate . . . Mother used to
tell us about Great-aunt Matilda. She was considered unrefined
because, when she was asked what part of the turkey she
preferred, she always replied 'the pope's nose' . . . But that
was three generations ago . . . A great deal may happen in less
than three generations . . . He hasn't a bad face, this young man
. . . I like pointed features. They remind me of a fox . . . I
always liked foxes. It is horrible the way people hunt them with
dogs. And deer too. It is horrible to be hunted. When human
beings are civilized, they will stop hunting things to death.
What would they think of a God that hunted men with immortal
hounds? Yet they hunt animals that way. For pleasure--merely for
pleasure. And women. They used to hunt fallen women, and witches
too, as cruelly as they hunt animals now. But Duncan won't hurt
foxes. And Marmaduke says only savages enjoy tormenting animals.
He says even religion is not so cruel as it used to be . . . But
how can religion be cruel if God is a loving Father? . . . Well,
all that is too deep for a woman's mind. Father used to say that
a woman's mind is like a flower, designed to shed fragrance, not
sense. . . . I wonder . . . I wonder if people really know any
more to-day than they used to? . . . That young man has nice eyes
too. I don't believe he would think me bold if I looked straight
at him. Not at my age. At my age men don't think about you at
all. Only when they need you to make pyjamas. Only in a war. I
don't like war, but I made nice pyjamas. Yes, I made nice
pyjamas. The other women thought I was silly to put in such fine
stitches. They told me I was wasting my eyesight. 'Just so they
will hold together, that's all we ask.' Who said that? It
couldn't have been Victoria. No, it was Bessie Caldwell. 'Just so
they will hold together.' That was the way she talked. 'More and
worse is my motto,' she told me. And the others were that way
too. I should never have put a wounded soldier in the pyjamas
they made. And how did they know who would wear them? I used to
hope they would send mine to the kind of young man I should have
chosen. Tall, strong, fair (I never liked dark men). It's funny,
at my age, but even now I don't like dark men. That was the
reason I always took the blue material before the other women
could get it. Never grey. I always hated grey because I've had to
wear it so much. But blue I like. Blue is better even than pink
for young men . . ."</p>
<p>Virginius and Duncan, who had lingered over a private
refreshment in the library, appeared, with smiling faces and
restored spirits, and inquired eagerlyif Victoria had provided
their favourite dishes for lunch? At this question, Victoria
transferred her patient gaze from Aunt Agatha to her husband.
Puzzled, but uncomplaining, she wondered mildly why Virginius,
who would cheerfully sacrifice his life for his country, had
never consented to surrender his daily thimbleful of old Bourbon!
To Victoria, whose apocalyptic vision of a well-ordered world was
one in which masculine appetites were harnessed to the feminine
ideal of service, nothing was easier than the sacrifice of her
own or other people's freedom. As with most women in affluent
circumstances, liberty was little more to her than an illustrious
name for which heroic but restless men had died in the past.</p>
<p>"You are not often so hungry," she remarked, with smiling
wifely firmness.</p>
<p>Though she addressed Virginius, it was Duncan who answered
with his laugh of amiable indifference. "It isn't every day that
Father prefers his thimbleful before lunch. Why didn't you join
us, Martin?"</p>
<p>Martin looked up with startled eyes, as if he had been
day-dreaming beside Aunt Agatha. "Nobody asked me."</p>
<p>"Why, I told Mary Victoria to send you after us."</p>
<p>"I knew whisky wasn't good for him," Mary Victoria explained,
sweetly but firmly. "The doctor told me a glass of sherry with
his meals would be more wholesome. I begged a bottle of Father's
oldest Amontillado. Here is your glass, Martin. Randall put it at
my place."</p>
<p>While she transferred the glass with her manner of bright
competence, and watched Randall, the butler, fetch the bottle of
sherry from the sideboard, her face wore its usual look of
angelic patience. "A flame of loveliness," Mrs. Littlepage
thought tenderly, and wondered where she had first heard the
phrase that sprang into her mind. "Beauty like that is a flame of
loveliness." Then, while the flash of irritation with which
Martin glanced at his wife subsided into a dazed and smouldering
worship, Victoria added shrewdly to herself, "Yet men are strange
creatures, and even beauty wears dull and tarnished after too
constant use. If only she will learn that husbands are safe to
lead but dangerous to drive." And the thought lingered in her
just and benevolent mind that relief work in devastated regions
is not the best preparation for marriage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c203" id="c203">III</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Bracing herself with an effort, for she felt very tired and
there was a warning pulse in her arteries, Victoria became aware
that a luminous veil had dropped between her and life. While she
sat there, beyond the lace and fruits and flowers, at the head of
her table, it seemed to her that she had withdrawn from reality,
and that time, like a shallow stream, flowed on without her.
"After all," she thought, with a detachment that would have been
incredible to her a few years before, "I have only a little while
to live, and none of this is very important." Even sparing
Virginius and the children did not seem to her any longer to
matter supremely. Sparing them was a confirmed habit, and like
all other confirmed habits, it was easier to obey than to break.
But, while the slow minutes ticked away from her, she told
herself that the whole century in which she had lived and
suffered and believed in unimportant ideals, was scarcely more
than a ripple in the current of being. "Scarcely more than a
ripple," she repeated, "and yet we make so much needless trouble
about letting it pass. Think of all the blood sacrifices that
have been made to unimportant ideals. Even now I am brave enough
to think these things merely because I am at the end, and I can
see that it all really matters so little. It isn't worthy the
effort to cover oneself with the shreds and tatters of what we
used to call duty . . ."</p>
<p>With this august term in her mind, her glance sprang back to
poor Aunt Agatha; for poor Aunt Agatha was an impressive example,
she felt, of what an urgent sense of duty may accomplish.</p>
<p>"Women don't repent like that to-day," Victoria thought,
watching her with a shudder of compassion. "I suppose there is
too much else for them to do." And she asked herself if such
expiation would have been possible even in the sedate 'seventies
if the picture theatres had been invented, to say nothing of the
still more demoralizing radio, which one could enjoy even in the
enforced privacy of a refuge for Magdalens. For a machine age
seemed to her to encourage remorse almost as indifferently as it
cherished virtue; and it was useless to deny, she sighed, with a
singular lack of concern, that the grand manner had departed from
seduction as from everything else. Even that last obligation of
honour, which had impelled an erring woman to screen her
betrayer, had been demolished in Queenborough by Mrs. Dalrymple's
completely articulate scandal.</p>
<p>With this thought in her mind, she remarked considerately,
"You must not let us make you late for your picture, Aunt Agatha.
Everyone says this new film is well worth seeing."</p>
<p>Aunt Agatha, who laughed at moving pictures but never smiled
at a man, raised her drooping lids for an instant. "If you will
excuse me, my dear, I shall not wait for dessert."</p>
<p>"Of course you must not wait, but are you going alone? I am
sorry we can't lend you the car."</p>
<p>A flush as pale as the glimmer of reflected shame stole over
Aunt Agatha's face. "I like to go alone," she responded slowly,
as if she were afraid of giving offence. Then, lowering her tone
to a still softer note, she added, "but I met Amy Dalrymple in
the street this morning, and she offered to drive me. I suppose
it is quite safe. She drove an ambulance in the war."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know." The faintest chill hardened Victoria's voice.
Just by nature, she had often regretted that she had never been
able to like Mrs. Dalrymple, that she had never been able really
to trust her. Besides, merely to compare her with poor Aunt
Agatha would prove beyond a doubt that the younger woman had
never sincerely repented. Repentance, after all, was the chief
thing to consider; and Victoria had seen enough of fallen women
on the stage, as well as in the Home for Unfortunates, to
convince her that the first and longest step in repentance is the
one that leads to the wiping away of every trace of make-up. No
woman so well dressed and so skilfully repaired as Mrs. Dalrymple
could ever, in Victoria's opinion, have endured the withering
fires of remorse. "I helped her as long as I could," she
reflected, "and I should have tried to do it still if Virginius
had not become so blindly prejudiced in her favour."</p>
<p>Still hovering beside her chair, poor Aunt Agatha appeared to
flicker out like a shadow in firelight, while Mary Victoria
remarked crisply: "I didn't know Mrs. Dalrymple had come back
from Paris. She was quite a toast in the war. All the French
generals lost their hearts to her." Then lowering her voice, she
added: "Her war record was splendid, but she spoiled it all by
her imprudent conduct after the Armistice."</p>
<p>"She said business brought her home," Aunt Agatha murmured.
"As soon as she has straightened out her affairs she expects to
return."</p>
<p>"I am sure she would find it more congenial abroad," Victoria
observed kindly enough. "I don't see how she could ever be happy
in Queenborough."</p>
<p>"Is anybody happy here?" Martin asked so suddenly that they
started and looked at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>Though his manner was more capricious that rude, he spoke as
if he expected an answer; and Victoria told herself that such a
question should not have come from any Virginian who had so
little reason to be satisfied with his progenitors. The truth was
that, after two weeks of earnest but futile effort to be
indulgent to her son-in-law, she was ready to confess that he was
beginning to wear on her nerves and that Mary Victoria's
infatuation became more incomprehensible to her every day that
she lived.</p>
<p>"We have always been very happy," she answered mildly, but
with the faintest accent of reprimand in her tone. Then her face
softened, and she turned with a caressing manner to poor Aunt
Agatha. "You must not let Mrs. Dalrymple impose on you, Aunt
Agatha. I would rather not say anything against her, but she has
always been rather a pushing person."</p>
<p>Aunt Agatha's thin throat worked convulsively beneath the wide
band of black grosgrain ribbon, which was considered more
suitable in her peculiar situation than the ornamental velvet
stripe of the honest but elderly. "I am sure she doesn't mean to
be pushing, Victoria. She has a hearty manner, and she doesn't
seem able, even with her past, to keep from enjoying life. But I
really think she felt sorry for me and was trying to be
kind."</p>
<p>The slightest quiver crossed Victoria's features. Only the
husk of her mind was speaking, she knew, only the inherited
covering of tradition and precept. Deep within the core of her
soul remained unconcerned and remote and faintly ironical. "I am
sure I don't think you need her sympathy, dear Aunt Agatha.
Surely she should have waited, don't you think, for the first
advance to come from us?"</p>
<p>To Mrs. Littlepage's distress, Aunt Agatha's reply was more
than sad, it was almost bitter. "I suppose it didn't occur to her
that she could harm my reputation." This, unhappily, was one of
the unforeseen results of the new psychology. Before the
broadening of religious views and loosening of moral standards,
poor Aunt Agatha would never have allowed bitterness to enter her
thoughts. "She stays out later, too," Victoria mused sadly. "She
spends entirely too much time at soda-fountains. Besides spoiling
her digestion, it makes her appear frivolous."</p>
<p>Well, there was nothing she could do about it except proffer a
tactful and delicate warning. If sixty-five wasn't a safe age,
especially after so dangerous a past, then there was little hope
that years would yield greater security.</p>
<p>"Don't you think, my dear," Virginius broke in, with a tinge
of asperity in his level voice, "don't you think, my dear, that
we may leave Aunt Agatha free to choose her own associates?"</p>
<p>"My advice was kindly meant, Virginius," Victoria replied in a
hurt tone; for she knew that his asperity would have wounded her
feeling if she had not been separated from him by that inward
isolation.</p>
<p>In the pause that followed, Mary Victoria remarked soothingly:
"I think mother is right to warn Aunt Agatha not to allow
unworthy persons to impose upon her good nature."</p>
<p>"But who is imposing upon Aunt Agatha, my dear?" Mr.
Littlepage inquired in the tone of judicial authority.</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear what she said of Mrs. Dalrymple, father?"</p>
<p>"I heard, my dear, but why should you be so ready to assume
that Mrs. Dalrymple is unworthy?"</p>
<p>At this Mary Victoria stared at him. "Why, I thought it all
happened, at least in the beginning, in Queenborough."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned. "It is true that she made a most
unfortunate marriage in her youth," he replied, while the
advocate usurped the place of the judge in his manner.</p>
<p>"Didn't her husband divorce her?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes." He could scarcely deny this in the presence of
Victoria's exact memory. "But, after all, that was as far back as
the end of the century. She married again, and very well, after
that."</p>
<p>"If it were only that!" sighed Mary Victoria, and continued
with shining eyes and a lovely colour. "If there had been nothing
else, we could have forgotten that because of her wonderful war
record. But she has really been most imprudent in the last few
years. Even in Europe she has become quite notorious, and it
takes a good deal to make anyone notorious in Europe."</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, I suppose it does," Virginius assented. An
unnatural flush was spreading over his face, and Victoria tried
not to observe that the purplish colour made his features appear
swollen. "He ought to be careful," she thought, with wifely
solicitude. "So many men of his age and build die of apoplexy."
With this danger in mind, she lowered her voice to a note of
admonishing tenderness. "Aren't you being a little imprudent in
your diet to-day, Virginius? The doctor advised you to eat very
lightly after that last attack.'"</p>
<p>Though Virginius made no direct reply to her warning, his
expression was overcast by one of those sullen moods that she had
learned to dread without understanding. "I think I'll have a
glass of sherry," was his only remark, and this was flung
carelessly over his shoulder to Randall, who was removing the
bottle of Amontillado.</p>
<p>"Give mother a thimbleful. She looks as if she needed it,"
Duncan said hastily, and while the words rang in her drumming
ears, Victoria remembered that he was the only one of the family
who ever noticed whether she looked well or ill. "With all his
peculiarities, I believe he cares more for me than the others,"
she found herself thinking, while she raised the glass of sherry
to her blue and trembling lips.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, without warning, that luminous veil dropped
again between her and life. Time flowed round her and beyond her
into an unconquerable vastness, and she knew that whatever
happened or did not happen would not deeply concern her. Nothing
was supremely important, least of all the intricate complications
of human affairs. "If only this soundless tumult would end," she
thought, with weary resignation, "and leave me at peace."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c204" id="c204">IV</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>A fortnight later, when Mrs. Littlepage was ready to admit
that, however hard she tried, she could never really like her
son-in-law, and to look forward with satisfaction to the day when
they should discover the small but perfect house for which they
were looking, Mary Victoria came to her unexpectedly one
afternoon.</p>
<p>"Mother dear, would you and father mind very much if we stayed
with you awhile longer?"</p>
<p>"Mind, darling?"</p>
<p>"I told Martin I was sure you would be glad to have us; but he
insists we ought to move the first of the year."</p>
<p>"Not if you are satisfied, my child. Not if you are both
comfortable."</p>
<p>"How could we help being comfortable? After all those hard
years abroad, I said to Martin this morning, it is like being in
Heaven. Can't you see how he improves every day?"</p>
<p>"I do think he looks better."</p>
<p>"And he is getting on very well with his work. Think how much
it means to him to have a safe place in Cousin Daniel's
bank."</p>
<p>"Of course, it isn't really Daniel's bank, dearest. He is only
the president. It does seem a good thing; but you must remember
that the bank, like your father's law firm, employs a number of
presentable young men who appear not to have any future. I think
that every time I go down there."</p>
<p>"Well, anyway, it is only a start, and it is a nice place to
be in, even if the salary is small. Then you and father are
always so good about helping us. You are really growing fond of
Martin, aren't you, mother?"</p>
<p>"Really, dear!" Though Mrs. Littlepage met her daughter's gaze
without flinching, she felt a rheumatic twinge in her conscience,
which seemed to her to have grown stiffer and more decrepit. For,
being of an inelastic habit of mind and body, she had, until the
last few weeks, found honesty easier than dissimulation, and now,
whenever necessity compelled her to lie, she rose tothe occasion
with more gallantry than grace.</p>
<p>"He is the kind of man who grows on you," Mary Victoria said
proudly. "The better you know him, the fonder you will be of
him."</p>
<p>"Well, that's good, dear. It is wiser not to reveal everything
in the beginning." Surely Mary Victoria must know her husband
better than anyone else could--unless you considered that
unfortunate girl who had known him entirely too well. Yet, in
spite of this consoling reminder, Mrs. Littlepage found herself
wondering again how love had ever attained its proverbial
reputation for wisdom. Surely, she repeated emphatically, Mary
Victoria ought to know her own husband--but did she? Hadn't she
been blinded from the beginning by the flames of that
ungovernable and disastrous passion? Nothing, indeed, in the
fifty-five years of her life, had astonished Mrs. Littlepage more
than the completeness of Mary Victoria's infatuation. "I wonder
if it can possibly last?" she thought, with mild disapproval. "He
is not worthy of it--but then you never can tell about love."</p>
<p>Serene, conquering, Mary Victoria turned her lovely auburn
head and raised her eyes, which were as shallow and as
transparent as sunlight, to the stainless blue of the sky above
the bared maples. Candour, sincerity, resourcefulness were in her
smile and her voice. "He is trying so hard to be everything I
wish," she said, with the imperious manner which had never
failed, at least in the Balkans, to overcome every masculine
obstacle. "He is doing his best to live up to my ideals."</p>
<p>"I am sure he is, dear," her mother assented warmly; and
feeling that something more than agreement was expected of her,
she hastened to remark, "After all, there is no end to the
influence of a good woman--"</p>
<p>"And you can see that I influence him, mother?"</p>
<p>"A blind man could see that, my child. He simply adores
you."</p>
<p>"If you think that now, I wish you could have seen how
dependent upon me he was in Paris and afterward in the Balkans.
In the first months he would follow me about as if he were afraid
I should vanish as soon as I got out of his sight. It was only
when I was with him, he used to say, that he could keep his head
out of the darkness. As soon as I went away that black depression
would close over him."</p>
<p>"He must have been in a bad way when you met him."</p>
<p>"It was terrible." She lowered her flutelike tones and
shuddered, as if the recollection were too much for her
composure. "He had been tempted so often to make away with
himself."</p>
<p>"But why, dear?" It was Mrs. Littlepage's turn to shudder; and
she did so, in spite of her conviction that God knew what was
best for the world, and acted accordingly. Yet, conceding this
hopeful faith, she could not dismiss the thought that, with all
the moral endurance required to make marriage successful, a man
who had wished to kill himself, even in France, could scarcely be
expected to stand the wear and tear of family life.</p>
<p>"Oh, you cannot imagine all that he went through, mother. It
would have wrung your heart to look at him when I first met him.
He was in a hospital, and he had been suffering for six months
from a nervous collapse. The truth is that he had starved himself
after he went back to Paris. He knew a number of young Americans
who were living there in a shiftless way, without any serious
purpose, and he tried to drift on just as the others did. But he
isn't strong, and he couldn't live without sufficient food and
clothes to keep warm. In the end that kind of life brought back
the trouble he had had after the war--"</p>
<p>"And then you met him?"</p>
<p>"Then I got father's letter, and I started immediately to look
for him. Oh, I can never be too thankful! It makes you believe
that God really takes care of you."</p>
<p>"Poor fellow! He must have suffered," her mother murmured
almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>"He went through hell, mother, before I found him. That was
what he told me in the hospital. 'I've been in hell,' he said to
me, 'and you look as if the heavens had opened and let you out.'
All the next few days I couldn't get the thought of his face out
of my mind. He has a poetic face, hasn't he, mother?"</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Littlepage assented. "Yes, he has a most
interesting face. Suffering has refined without disfiguring him.
That is one of the advantages that men have over women. Trouble
is becoming to them."</p>
<p>"There is something about the way his hair sweeps back from
his forehead that reminds me of Shelley--or, perhaps, it is
Keats."</p>
<p>"I am not sure," her mother rejoined vaguely, "neither face is
quite clear in my mind."</p>
<p>"And his eyes are remarkable."</p>
<p>"Quite remarkable," Mrs. Littlepage echoed, for an echo, she
felt, was all that was left of her usual explicitness.</p>
<p>"I forgot to tell you how I was able to find him. It was
through Henry Peyton, who had known him in the army, and had kept
in touch with him because they were both from the same place.
They moved in different circles here," she added frankly, "but
you can't begin to realize, until you have lived in Europe, how
little American social distinctions amount to over there."</p>
<p>Another murmur and a weaker one was Mrs. Littlepage's only
response.</p>
<p>"It was touching to see how grateful Martin was for everything
I said or did," Mary Victoria continued in the same fluent
whisper. "Do you know that I was the first really good woman who
ever came into his life? Of course, I don't mean his mother," she
hastened to explain. "His mother must have been good and very
unselfish--but she wasn't a strong character."</p>
<p>"Yes, dear, I understand."</p>
<p>"Then this girl father wrote me about--She wasn't at all the
right kind of girl, mother."</p>
<p>"I suppose not, my child. But you must remember that standards
are very different now from what they used to be. It looks,
indeed, as if we were living in an age without a middle way.
While one extreme is trying so unselfishly to make the world
better, the other is bent on throwing every moral restraint to
the winds."</p>
<p>"But that doesn't explain father."</p>
<p>"Well, you know how men are about women, my dear."</p>
<p>"She seems to have made him think that black is white. Have
you ever seen her?"</p>
<p>"Occasionally in the office, and several times when she was
ill during the war. She is very attractive-looking without being
really beautiful. I wished to help her, of course, but I thought
it unwise of your father to keep her in his office."</p>
<p>"Even now he won't let her go. Don't you feel that she is a
designing person, mother?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage sighed. "It is all beyond me, my child."</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you what a shock it was to me when I found out
the truth," Mary Victoria said sadly. "Father would never have
told me who she was. I should never have known the truth if you
had not written to warn me against Martin."</p>
<p>"I acted upon impulse. Never for an instant had I suspected
that there was anything between you and Martin. How could I have
known when you were so careful not to mention him in your
letters?" Mrs. Littlepage's voice dropped reproachfully. "And I
thought I had your confidence."</p>
<p>"Oh, you had, mother darling! But wasn't it simply hopeless to
try to explain? How could you ever have understood until you had
seen him?" Rising, she glanced at the clock. "I have just time to
change my dress before I call for him."</p>
<p>"Would you like my car? I do not feel able to go out."</p>
<p>"No, I'd rather drive myself; but I'm so sorry, mother
dearest. Shall I tuck you in on the couch?"</p>
<p>"In a minute, dear. Perhaps you might stop for your father on
your way home."</p>
<p>A troubled frown gathered on Mary Victoria's smooth forehead.
"If you wish it, I will, of course, but I've almost a nervous
dread of going to father's office. I never know when I may run
across that woman."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is disagreeable." Mrs. Littlepage's voice sounded
tired and listless. If only there were not so many needless
complications in life! "Of course we mustn't interfere with her
earning a living," she protested gently.</p>
<p>"Oh, I never meant that, mother!" Mary Victoria flushed as she
always did when there was the faintest suggestion of criticism.
"Only it does seem that she might as well earn her living as
secretary to some other man. Have you ever put it to him this
way?"</p>
<p>"Yes, once, as soon as you came home. I felt that the
situation was painful to us all, and I asked him if he couldn't
find a place for Milly Burden with some other man of fine
character. He seemed to think, however, that she was useful to
him, and that he should miss her if he sent her away. Besides, he
has a fixed idea that he is largely to blame."</p>
<p>"To blame?" The word was a cry. "Why, mother, he knows the
truth."</p>
<p>"Yes, he knows, and that, he says, fixes the responsibility.
He feels that if he had not interfered in the Burden girl's life,
you would never have married Martin."</p>
<p>"He didn't understand. He was trying to help her."</p>
<p>"It is useless, my dear, to try to follow the workings of a
man's mind. He insists that his trying to help her has given him
an incurable distaste for interfering in people's lives."</p>
<p>"But a girl like that, mother. You told me yourself that she
never showed any signs of regret."</p>
<p>"I know that, Mary Victoria, and I know also that it is
hopeless to argue with a man after he has formed an opinion. I
doubt if your father is more set in his ideas than other men, but
I have long ago ceased to try to change his point of view about
anything. After all that has happened, he insists that Milly
Burden is a good woman."</p>
<p>"Good, mother, how can he? As if Martin--"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me, my child, for I cannot answer."</p>
<p>"No woman would call her good," Mary Victoria insisted.</p>
<p>"And no man either, my dear, if she were his wife or his
sister. It is her not being related to him or requiring anything
of him that enables him to take that view of her conduct."</p>
<p>"But father of all men! Why, I always thought--Are you tired,
mother? You are looking so pale."</p>
<p>"Just a little. I'll lie down now until it is time to dress.
My heart has been giving me trouble ever since that attack of
pneumonia. Will you let me have a little more air?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am so sorry! Let me wrap you up before I go."</p>
<p>After she had settled her on the deep couch in front of the
log fire, Mary Victoria tucked in the rose-coloured coverlet,
pressed a kiss on her mother's cheek, and went over to the open
window. "Shall I close the blinds?"</p>
<p>"No, I like the light." Her voice was scarcely more than a
quaver. "I like light and air."</p>
<p>"Is there anything more I can do for you?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, dearest." The soundless and invisible tumult was
swelling about her. "Rest is all that I need."</p>
<p>"Then try to take a little nap. I'll tell Luella to look in
every now and then and see that you are all right. Don't think of
stirring until I bring father home."</p>
<p>Her confident step crossed the room; the door quietly opened
and shut; and Mrs. Littlepage drew a breath of relief while she
closed her eyes and sank down in the soft cushions under the warm
rose-coloured coverlet.</p>
<p>Yes, Mary Victoria was more inspiring than restful. "Much as I
love her, she always leaves me exhausted." Or was it that
everything left her exhausted? Every discussion, even the
simplest, like this motherly talk, left her tremulous and
unstrung, with her soul and body gasping for air. Before that
severe illness, she had been able to take a hopeful view of the
most discouraging prospect and to quiet her thoughts by slowly
repeating magic formula. But of late, in the last few months,
even her magic formula had failed of its efficacy. And outwardly,
too, she was worn. Lines were in her face that had not been there
last year. Greyish smoke was stealing over his chestnut hair; and
it had become an effort to weave the old animation in and out of
her words. For all things moving on earth, nothing seemed to her
now to matter so little as words. They were unreal; they were as
insubstantial as shadows; they came between one and life. Closing
her eyes to the sunshine, which quivered in from the window, she
asked herself why the importance of living had flattened out as
suddenly as a pricked balloon? "A few months ago I thought I had
a full life," she meditated, "and now I seem to have nothing.
Does everything resolve itself into the running down of physical
energy? If only I were not so tired, I might care more," she
thought, "but I have ceased to care, that is the trouble. I have
ceased to feel that anything matters. . . ." Time and space
slipped away from her. Like a pale cloud, she felt them unwinding
about her; she felt them dissolving and evaporating in a mist of
light through the window and beyond into the transcendent blue of
the sky. Marriage had dropped from her, too, with all the years
and the crowd of withered husks she had once considered so vital.
Her heart was throbbing with tenderness; but it was the
tenderness of the past, not the present, and she realized
suddenly that the loves which had stayed by her, even when she
was unaware of their nearness, were the loves of her childhood.
"Is it true that love is outside of time?" she asked, amazed and
delighted. "Is it true that life passes, but the spirit of life
is immortal? . . ." She was no longer middle-aged; she was no
longer worn and discarded by time. Smothered in the rich darkness
of memory, she was swept away by a sensation of lightness, by a
torrent of ecstasy. "Why, I am a child," she exclaimed aloud. "I
am not really old. It is all a dream, and I have never been
anything but a child. It is absurd to think that I could live if
I lost mother. If I lost mother and Rollo, there wouldn't be any
life." She saw, through this rich darkness, the glimmering
outline of her mother's head against the pale sunshine beyond the
window. On her hand, hanging down from the couch, she felt the
moist nose of Rollo, her spaniel. "Oh, I could never love anyone
more than Rollo," she thought, "more than mother and Rollo. But I
have never lost them. They have always been here. It is only time
that has gone on and left us . . ."</p>
<p>She was still dreaming, still submerged in that glimmering
darkness, when the sound of a laugh in the street came dancing in
like a shower of golden motes in the sunlight. So liquid, so
vital, so joyous, was this melody that it awakened everything in
the room to life, even the inanimate objects, even the chairs,
the mirror, the pictures, the bowl of white and golden
chrysanthemums. "There are some people so alive that it hurts,"
Mrs. Littlepage sighed wearily, opening her eyes. "Nobody but
Mrs. Dalrymple would laugh like that in the street!" The laugh
rippled and stopped and rippled again. Flinging the robe aside,
Victoria started up and crossed the floor to the window. Outside
there was the long, straight street filled with violet-blue
shadows and the troubled sunshine of autumn. Shadows, dust,
emptiness, and overhead the apricot-coloured light in the sky
laced with the slender branches of trees.</p>
<p>In the first glance this was all that she saw. Then, as if
some crystal globe of vision were suddenly shattered, there
emerged out of nowhere the familiar red hat and amber hair and
vague artificial lustre of Mrs. Dalrymple. Beside the curb the
smart grey motor was standing; and on the pavement Aunt Agatha
had paused for a last glimpse of her friend. "Why, she is with
her again!" Victoria thought in surprise. "I believe they go to
every moving picture together. Divorced for immorality," she
added, as indifferently as if Mrs. Dalrymple were one of the
imprudent ladies who make interesting history, "and not a day
under fifty. Yet still golden, still gay and defiant, and still
able to have her laugh at the world." Well, she also had her
quality. Everyone praised her character in war, if not in peace,
and surely a war record was something which no one (least of all
Victoria, who had cut, hemmed, stitched, rolled, knitted, smiled
persistently, and eaten sparingly, throughout the conflict) could
wish to disparage. "Only," Mrs. Littlepage concluded, disturbed
but still benevolent, "I thought that cooing had gone out of
fashion even in the Balkans."</p>
<p>They had parted now. Aunt Agatha had turned away, grasping her
black skirt, the long and proper skirt of repentance, and Mrs.
Dalrymple had lowered her daring head and grasped the wheel in
her large and capable hands. Then, just as she was about to drive
on, her name was called in a genial voice, and Mr. Littlepage
appeared on the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>"He must have walked up," Victoria thought quickly, "but why,
why?"</p>
<p>Very gallantly Virginius was lifting his hat to Mrs.
Dalrymple. Very gallantly, like a man who feels young but
remembers that he is a Southern gentleman, he was crossing the
street in that faint sunshine, which cast a deceptively slender
shadow behind him. "How well he looks," his wife said to herself;
"how well he retains his youth. I am glad he walked up. The
exercise has brought a glow to his face."</p>
<p>For an instant he stood there beside the car, looking steadily
at Mrs. Dalrymple, who looked as steadily, and even more
alluringly, at him. Then something--was it a glance, a word, a
sigh, a smile, or even a coo?--flitted between them. Something so
soft, Victoria observed, more amused than startled, that it
melted to air in a breath and was lost in the stillness.</p>
<p>"I must ask him what it was," she murmured, turning away as
she saw her husband enter the gate. "Some men, I suppose, might
still find her attractive, but Virginius is different."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c205" id="c205">V</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Early in December, perfect candour demolished the glassy
reserve of Southern tradition.</p>
<p>"You understand, mother dear," Mary Victoria began, "why I
wish to be near you at this time?"</p>
<p>"I suspected, my child."</p>
<p>"I was mistaken once, so I waited to be quite sure. But I feel
almost too well to believe it is true. Not even for a minute has
there been the faintest discomfort."</p>
<p>"My darling, I am so thankful!" Even in the burst of emotion,
Mrs. Littlepage found herself recalling an old wives'
superstition of her youth. "But she must not feel too well, poor
dear. An easy beginning," they used to say, "makes a hard
ending." Clasping her daughter in her arms, she told herself that
now, if ever, was the moment for complete sympathy.</p>
<p>"Then you do understand, mother?" Was it the composed voice or
the gentle withdrawal that made Mrs. Littlepage turn away, wiping
her eyes, and look out of the window? Why, she wondered, should
she expect this discovery to change the nature of Mary
Victoria?</p>
<p>"I understand," she answered, as soon as she could command her
voice. "There isn't any place for you but our house. I could not
bear it if I were not able to watch over you."</p>
<p>"But you need watching over, too, mother. You have not been a
bit like yourself. There are times when you seem so far away that
I wonder what you are thinking about."</p>
<p>"About nothing, probably, my child. I suppose it is because I
am not so strong as I used to be; and I do feel sometimes that
everything is too much."</p>
<p>"Isn't there any rest for you? Father would take you to
Florida?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, not Florida. I couldn't stand Florida." That
senseless irritation again, and the exhausting effort to keep it
out of her voice. Why was it that everything, even kindness,
irritated her nerves? "It is just as if I were listening for some
familiar voice in the midst of a tempest," she thought, "and
every needless word that is uttered makes it the more difficult
for me to hear clearly."</p>
<p>"It is so important for you to take care of yourself,
mother."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage turned a pensive smile on her daughter. Then a
quiver of nervous exasperation drove a smile from her lips.
"Don't worry about me, my child," she remonstrated in a tone more
impatient than she had ever used to Mary Victoria. "It isn't
really important enough. All I need is time to collect myself.
But, of course, I must watch over you as long as I live. After I
am dead, I hope you will feel that you can turn to Louisa--"</p>
<p>"Oh, mother, darling, don't talk about dying!"</p>
<p>"Never again, dear, only I wanted to tell you that Louisa is
almost a second mother to you. And remember this is your home,
too. Don't think another minute about finding a house."</p>
<p>"I told Martin you would feel that way."</p>
<p>"Of course, he understood."</p>
<p>Mary Victoria sighed softly, with the infinite patience that
is the essence of wifehood. "Yes, he understands, but he has been
longing to be in our home. Not that he doesn't enjoy being here,
but you know how men are."</p>
<p>"Surely he must realize--" Mrs. Littlepage began, and broke
off because she could think of nothing to add. For Martin, she
told herself, was the last person who should have suggested that
a change might be desirable. Certainly, if anyone had been made
uncomfortable, it was Virginius, who so heartily disliked his
son-in-law.</p>
<p>Sighing audibly, she turned to the couch, and drew the
rose-coloured robe over her bosom, which, in spite of thirty-one
years of wedlock, had remained virgin in sentiment. Though she
had been a perfect wife to Virginius, there were moments when she
acknowledged that in her heart of hearts she had never really
liked men. She was fond of Virginius; she was faithful; she was
tender in affliction; yet she had never, except for the few
months of courtship, enjoyed him as naturally as she enjoyed
Louisa. For more than fifty years Louisa had understood her more
absolutely than any man can understand the woman he loves.
Beautiful as this long association had been, it was fortunate,
Victoria reflected now, that it had come to flower before the
serpent of Freudian psychology had poisoned the sinless Eden of
friendship. With Virginius she breathed thankfully, life, on the
whole, had been easy. Marriage, it is true, had been to her less
a pleasure than an agreeable duty; but Virginius, since he had
been born without a lower nature, was easily satisfied. "I did
the best I could," she thought, and immediately there flashed
across her mind the eternal wonder if, in other circumstances,
with another love, life would not have been different? Even now,
from some vast loneliness, she felt the spreading wings of her
dream, of that desire beneath all other desires which is
inarticulate and everlasting. Closing her eyes to the wistful
December day, she heard that far-off thundering gallop of flight.
"I am really a sentimentalist," she murmured to herself, "and I
suppose sentimentality will die with me. But it doesn't matter so
long as Virginius has been happy. Men are made that way," she
added the more tenderly because she had never really liked them.
"They are made that way, unobservant, complacent, easily
satisfied."</p>
<p>Startled out of her reverie, she awoke, across an immeasurable
distance, to the level tones of Mary Victoria's voice, which
seemed to her as thin and meaningless as a whistling noise in the
street.</p>
<p>"I wish, mother, you would speak to Martin."</p>
<p>"Speak to him?" With a dazed mind, Mrs. Littlepage reflected
that she was unequal not only to life, but to marriage.</p>
<p>"Tell him, I mean, that it is best for us to stay on until
after my baby comes. I really believe that you have more
influence over him than I have. There are times," Mary Victoria
concluded, with a break in her calm voice, "when I think that my
opinion means less to him than anyone's."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage shook her head. "That isn't true, dear. Every
wife feels that way, but it isn't true."</p>
<p>One of Mary Victoria's most endearing traits was that she
never stooped to an argument. "You will speak to him, won't you,
mother?" was her only reply.</p>
<p>"If you wish it, dear, of course I will speak to him. But I
have never felt that he liked me."</p>
<p>"Oh, mother, he admires you greatly. It may be"--her tone was
hurt--"because you have never tried to conceal your dislike for
him."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, you are mistaken."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you do really and truly dislike him, and instead of
making him hate you, as it would me, it has only given him a
respect for your opinion. I shall never," she declared in a tone
that was almost hysterical, "even pretend to understand men!"</p>
<p>"Well, I'll speak to him," Mrs. Littlepage promised, feeling
that it was better to humour than to contradict a woman in Mary
Victoria's condition. All her life, it seemed to her, she had
been speaking to people for their good; all her life she had been
trying to make the world better; all her life, in the words of
her mother's chosen epitaph, she had done the best that she
could. But, in the last few months, since this spiritual apathy
had pervaded her being, she had become indifferent alike to
public welfare and private reform. Flying beyond Mary Victoria,
her gaze fluttered over the window-sill and sank down, like a
tired bird, in the golden dust of the sunset. "Yes, I'll speak to
him," she repeated. Nothing was worth to her now the protracted
pang of a struggle with destiny. "Of course," she continued after
a pause, "he wouldn't be so selfish as to try to take you away."
But she was thinking, "How can he help being selfish when he has
never thought of anyone in his life?"</p>
<p>"Aren't all men selfish, mother?" asked Mary Victoria.</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage felt her gaze flutter back with trembling
wings from the afterglow. "Most men are selfish when they are in
love," she answered slowly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't mean only when they are in love, but even when
they are not in love. Don't they always think first of
themselves?" Her voice quivered to a flutelike pitch, and a flush
of resentment stained the pearly texture of her forehead.</p>
<p>"Not your father, my dear. Your father has never considered
himself; but, you must remember, there are few men to compare
with him."</p>
<p>"But even father doesn't always think of his family. If only
he could realize how unhappy he makes me about that woman--" Her
perfect equilibrium was shattered as if by a sudden blow, and she
burst into tears.</p>
<p>"My dear, my dear--" Mrs. Littlepage murmured, and felt that
her tone was wanting in sympathy. "You oughtn't to say that, Mary
Victoria," she continued, after a pause, in which she found
herself gasping for air. "At least give him credit for
generosity--for trying to do his best in a difficult
situation."</p>
<p>"But he makes it more difficult, mother. Oh, why can't he see
it? He could be just as generous to somebody else."</p>
<p>"You can't make him see that. After all, my child, even the
most generous men are seldom generous in exactly the ways we
prefer." She sighed, without knowing why, and gazed dreamily at
the bared trees.</p>
<p>For an instant Mary Victoria frowned. Then the frown
disappeared, and she looked noble and wounded. "I shouldn't have
cared before I married," she said, catching her proud upper lip
in her perfect teeth. "Then I thought only of helping women to
reform, and in Europe, where I met so many people of loose
morals, I never let myself draw the line at a single one of
them--not even at Mrs. Dalrymple. It is only since I've been
married that I've begun to feel differently."</p>
<p>"A wife always feels differently."</p>
<p>"I don't think I ever realized how strong the hold of a bad
woman can be on a man."</p>
<p>"No good woman ever realizes the strength of weakness until
she has tried to combat it," Mrs. Littlepage responded. "That,"
she continued, with a flash of insight, "has made it possible for
women to erect a standard of virtue. Only upon that single
principle have they ever stood together in defence of their
rights."</p>
<p>Mary Victoria flinched. "Martin hates that word. He says
people, even married people, have no rights towards each other,
only privileges."</p>
<p>"Most men say that, my dear, except in the sacred matter of
property. To understand all that a wife feels about marriage, I
suppose a man would have to think in terms, not of sentiment, but
of property. When you are older, and have become a mother as well
as a wife, you will understand that men and women, even in
marriage, do not speak the same language."</p>
<p>"Isn't it strange how two human beings can love without
understanding?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps that is why they love," remarked her mother, with
innocent satire. "Your uncle Marmaduke would tell you that love
is a divine misunderstanding."</p>
<p>"But I like to feel, mother, that I understand Martin."</p>
<p>"I am sure you do, darling. As for this girl, I should simply
try to put her out of my mind. Men get over these affairs almost
before they are begun. Especially after they marry a good
woman."</p>
<p>"That used to seem unfair to the other woman," Mary Victoria
murmured, "but now I see things so differently."</p>
<p>"Naturally you do. You couldn't be expected to know about men
until you were married."</p>
<p>"No, I don't mean quite that, mother dear. I should hate to
think that I'd grown narrow just because I'm happy."</p>
<p>"Isn't all happiness narrow, my child?"</p>
<p>"It oughtn't to be. If I could help that girl in any way, if I
could show her how to regain her self-respect, I am sure that I
should feel it to be a duty."</p>
<p>"Don't let that idea enter your mind now, dear, when you need
to think only bright and cheerful thoughts. There isn't any way
you can help her. I asked your father about it as soon as I
discovered the truth, and he said she did not wish to be helped.
She has, it seems, a great deal of false pride." Though her voice
carried conviction, it seemed to Mrs. Littlepage that her
mind--no, something deeper than her mind, perhaps her soul--had
become merely a rustling vacancy. And in this vacancy, all moral
problems, even the one of wayward women, were blown like straws
in the sultry wind of oblivion.</p>
<p>"They are so different to-day from what they used to be," Mary
Victoria sighed regretfully, in spite of her advanced point of
view."</p>
<p>"So different, my child, that we have been obliged to change
the name of our institution because fallen women refused to enter
a Home for Unfortunates. We have found it wiser to call it the
Home of Hope." A spark of humour flashed from her glance and was
reflected, beneath the sadness, in her daughter's smile.</p>
<p>"That does sound more modern," Mary Victoria assented, "and it
is certainly more American, too." Her lip trembled, and she added
hastily, "What worries me most is that men don't feel about women
the way they used to feel. Especially the men who were thrown
with foreign customs"--and her mother knew that she was thinking
of Martin--"appear to take nothing seriously. When I said
something to Martin about the sanctity of marriage, he asked me
why marriage was any more sacred than celibacy."</p>
<p>"He was only teasing you, dear. I suppose it does sound funny
to-day."</p>
<p>"Was father ever like that?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage shook her head while she tried in vain to
remember if Virginius was like that thirty-one years before.
"Your father belongs to another age. He was brought up to believe
in the ideals of marriage."</p>
<p>"Well, it is a pity that ideals have gone out of fashion. When
I married Martin I thought that I could become a power for good
in his life. That is what father used to call you when we were
children."</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember," Mrs. Littlepage murmured; but she was
asking herself if she were really the Victoria who had once, long
ago, in some bloomless Eden of tradition, become the wife of
Virginius? Well, she had done her best to live up to what a
husband of the 'nineties expected, though she had found, as she
so often reminded herself, that being an influence is very
exhausting. "The only way," she continued, after a long silence,
"is to go very slowly. Few men are influenced for good as long as
they are aware of it. Even your father, and men were more
sentimental in his generation, did not like to know that he was
being influenced."</p>
<p>"But I hate deception. Oh, mother, can't we ever tell men the
truth?"</p>
<p>"Not often, my child, and never so long as we want anything
from them. I'd go very slowly, if I were you, especially in the
matter of forcing Martin to go to church with you."</p>
<p>"But it looks as if he neglected me. Father goes with you to
St. Luke's."</p>
<p>"Naturally, my dear, he has always gone with me. But you must
not make the mistake of judging Martin by your father."</p>
<p>"We've always been religious, mother, and nice people in
Queenborough go to church no matter what they believe."</p>
<p>"They used to, I know. Nevertheless, I'd go slowly, my dear.
You will be much wiser not to insist upon anything, but to make
every allowance for your husband's upbringing. Be careful, no
matter how strongly you are tempted, not to mention this girl's
name to him. Give me a little time, and I'll see what I can do
with your father."</p>
<p>Though she had assumed the burden with her usual fortitude,
there was an artificial brightness in the smile with which Mrs.
Littlepage watched Mary Victoria open the door and disappear into
the hall. "My task is too much for me," she thought, with a
weariness that seemed to her to belong to the spirit. "I have
tried to do my best, but my task is too much for me." As she
lifted her eyes to the light, she was visited again by that
poignant sense of the hallucination of all mortal experience.
Ideals, duty, emotion, memory, the bare boughs, the brown earth,
the glittering sky--all these things she could look through as
clearly as if they floated before her eyes in some transparent
medium. "It must be weakness," she said aloud. "I have never felt
like this until now." And then suddenly, out of nowhere,
illumination streamed into her mind. "It wasn't so easy as they
think," she heard her voice saying above that soundless confusion
which vibrated without and within. "It wasn't so easy as they
think; but I did the best I could." Her thoughts, which had been
clouded and dull, were transfigured by those sunken rays from the
sky. Spirals of golden dust quivered and vanished and quivered
again in her consciousness. "There is something I must tell
Virginius and the children before it is too late," she added
hurriedly, rising from the couch and touching the electric lamp
on her desk. "I must try to remember what it is; for it is very
important, and I must not die without telling them." With her pen
in hand and the paper before her, she found that she was
trembling with eagerness. There was, she felt, some secret of
tremendous significance to divulge--only she did not know how to
begin. What was the meaning of it? Why had she never thought of
it until the end of her life? And why, having thought of it,
could she find no words that would convey what she was longing to
write? "It is about death," she thought. "I must tell them what I
have learned about death." Yet what was it that she had learned?
And how could she make them understand if she told them? "It is
the only thing that is important, and it is the only thing that
sounds cannot express. . . ."</p>
<p>"December 7th, 192-" she wrote, and after a pause went on more
slowly:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR HUSBAND:<br>
<br>
I have known for almost six months that I have a very short while
to live, and my one effort has been to spare you and the
children, to keep you from suspecting. Nothing, I know, can spoil
this last perfect winter, or perhaps year, that we shall all have
together. But, before it is too late, there is something I wish
to say to you--</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>With the pen still in her hand, she looked through the window
to the fading light and beyond into the encompassing void. The
illumination had died down as suddenly as it had flared into her
thoughts. Only hollowness was left now, only hollowness, where a
few minutes before that golden dust had quivered and vanished.
"It isn't really important," she said in a whisper, "or if it is,
I have forgotten. After all, I am too sleepy to think. Another
time I may be able to remember what I wanted to say. Another
time, but not now."</p>
<p>Laying the pen aside, she slipped the sheet of paper into a
drawer, and turned off the lamp. Then, shivering a little, she
went back to the couch and fell asleep, under the rose-coloured
blanket, in the firelight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c206" id="c206">VI</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The following night, when they were alone and not too sleepy
after a small dinner at Louisa Goddard's, Victoria found an
occasion to speak privately to Virginius.</p>
<p>"Mary Victoria is expecting to become a mother, my dear," she
began, with the slightest touch of concern.</p>
<p>"So soon?" Mr. Littlepage exclaimed. "I hope she is
pleased."</p>
<p>"She is delighted. But it isn't so soon, Virginius. You forget
that they were married last spring."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is hard to bear that in mind. Well, better late than
never."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage gazed at him reproachfully. "I wonder what has
come over you, Virginius? You seem to grow more flippant every
day that you live."</p>
<p>"I am sorry, my dear. I wasn't aware of it. However, if Mary
Victoria is pleased, my attitude is of no consequence."</p>
<p>"That is just what I started to tell you. Mary Victoria has
been worrying over your attitude. Of course, any worry is bad for
her. An expectant mother ought to keep a cheerful outlook on
life." She had had this phrase ready for hours, packed away in
her mind as neatly as if it were a rolled bandage.</p>
<p>"Certainly, I hope I have done nothing to disturb her," Mr.
Littlepage rejoined in the tone of formal apology.</p>
<p>While he looked at her despondently, she observed again that
his face had grown heavier and that his eyes were perplexed and
troubled, as if they were trying in vain to reach a decision.
This was what that unfortunate marriage had done to him. With the
thought lodged in her mind, it seemed to Mrs. Littlepage that her
whole world was revolving round a central enigma. "I am sure I
don't know what is to be done about it," she said in a tone which
implied that she knew only too well.</p>
<p>"Done about what? Are you still speaking of my attitude?"</p>
<p>"No, of Mary Victoria. She isn't, I fear, quite happy, poor
child."</p>
<p>"Who is, my dear?"</p>
<p>"Well, we are happy, Virginius, at least in our marriage,"
Victoria replied patiently. "If only the child had waited to know
her own heart."</p>
<p>"Well, she can hardly blame us for that. She didn't ask our
advice, and it seems to me she has shown a decided reluctance to
hear our opinion."</p>
<p>"We must not think of that now. What we must do now," Victoria
insisted sweetly but firmly, "is to help her make the best of the
situation and bring a happy child into the world."</p>
<p>There was an unwholesome flavour of sarcasm, she told herself
sadly, in his rejoinder, "So we are to be offered up this time to
the third generation?" A shiver of apprehension ran through her
nerves, for she felt a presentiment that he was about to resist
not only her moral influence, but even her maternal
infallibility. The sensation of rocking foundations, of a
shifting world, attacked her while she stood there, with her
ivory hairbrush in her hand, securely planted on the stable
surface of American democracy, in which the superiority of wives
is as firmly established as the divine right of averages. For an
instant her knees trembled, and she was thankful for the frail
support of a Heppelwhite chair. Without a prop, either moral or
physical, it seemed to her that she must give way beneath this
endless burden of sparing people, of persuading them to do right,
of being an inspiration for good. "If I had to do it over again,
I'd consider myself more," she thought, without bitterness. "If I
had to do it over again, I shouldn't expect so much of life."</p>
<p>"I sometimes wonder if we don't defeat our ends by placing too
much stress on happiness," Virginius was saying. "When we flash
so many searchlights upon an emotion, isn't there a danger that
we shall extinguish the glow?"</p>
<p>"The idea has crossed my mind," Victoria admitted, "but surely
it is natural to wish happiness for our children."</p>
<p>"Surely. I was merely wondering if we were doing our best to
produce it. Weren't the older generations happier than ours?
Certainly, they enjoyed life in a way that we have lost or
forgotten."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. I hadn't thought of it. But, even if that were true,
we can't step back several generations. All we can do is to pass
on the best we have to our children. Just now, I confess, my
first thought is for Mary Victoria. If only I can live long
enough to see her contented--"</p>
<p>"Contented?" she heard her husband's slow voice repeating the
word. "Does she really expect to be contented with Martin?"</p>
<p>"Doesn't every woman in love expect to be contented--or
happy?"</p>
<p>"I hope so, my dear. But I should have imagined it would
require more than love to create such an illusion in Mary
Victoria's mind."</p>
<p>Victoria sighed and considered. It was incredible to her that
Virginius, who had once been orthodox in religion and an idealist
in love, should have assumed what she called in her own mind a
metallic armour of cynicism. Was this true of Virginius alone she
wondered, or did it mean that wherever you scratched a cynic you
found a disappointed idealist?</p>
<p>"Don't you think you may be a little too severe?" she urged
gently. "Martin seems to us unworthy of Mary Victoria, but, after
all, we must remember that she saw him in Europe where everything
is so different. He is attractive in his queer way, and it is
natural for every woman to believe that love, especially if it is
her love, will work a miracle in a man."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've given that up long ago. I confess that I have never
understood women."</p>
<p>"Oh, Virginius, not your wife, not your daughter?"</p>
<p>"All I can see is that Mary Victoria has plunged us into an
ignoble problem, and you tell me that she did it from the highest
motives."</p>
<p>"No, my dear, I only told you that she was not swept away by a
selfish passion. She sincerely believed that her love would make
another man of him."</p>
<p>"Another man? I understood that she had fallen in love with
the man that he is."</p>
<p>"Virginius!" Mrs. Littlepage's voice was trembling with
weakness. "Do you realize that you are sneering at the most
sacred feeling in your daughter's life?" The words, as she
uttered them, seemed to her to float across an immeasurable
space, and to be spoken by some empty husk of herself that she
had discarded centuries ago.</p>
<p>"I am not sneering, Victoria. I am asking questions. What is
there sacred in Mary Victoria's mistaken belief that she can
perform miracles?"</p>
<p>"You don't understand these things, Virginius, but any woman
would know what I mean."</p>
<p>"Have patience, my dear, for I am trying to see light. I can
understand Mary Victoria's being swept away by an infatuation;
but I fail to comprehend why it should be noble for her to
imagine that she could make a silk purse out of an ass's
ear."</p>
<p>"You aren't often so harsh, Virginius."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. Apart from anything he has done, I confess I
can't stomach the fellow."</p>
<p>Again she looked at him with reproach. Never had she found him
so invulnerable to that peaceful penetration which has proved
almost as effective in marriage as in war. "I am not thinking of
Martin, Virginius, but of Mary Victoria. As a mother, it is
natural that I should think first of Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"I regret her marriage as much as you do. But since she is
married, and about to become a mother, don't you think it is more
Christian to suspend judgment and hope for the best?"</p>
<p>"You are right, my dear," Virginius assented. "You are right
as usual."</p>
<p>"Then you will do all that you can to protect Mary
Victoria?"</p>
<p>"Naturally. Could you think I should do otherwise?"</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't, Virginius." Her weary voice rose on a
triumphant note. "That is just what I said to her."</p>
<p>"Said to her?" He had turned away to the window; but at these
disconcerting words, he wheeled round and faced her again. All
his life, especially since his marriage, he had disliked argument
when he was in pyjamas, because, in some obscure fashion, he
associated them with unconditional surrender.</p>
<p>"That was exactly what I said to her when she asked me if you
realized how unhappy the thought of that other girl makes
her."</p>
<p>He frowned. "I suppose she means Milly Burden. But I am not
responsible for her. Martin is the man."</p>
<p>"Oh, Virginius, how can you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't mean just that. It is too late now to speak
with any decision, and even at the right time I doubt if speaking
would have done any good. But I can never understand the way
women appear invariably to take the side of a cad."</p>
<p>"Not always, Virginius. Surely you have not forgotten my
defence of poor Aunt Agatha and even of Mrs. Dalrymple."</p>
<p>"Yes, I give you credit for that. You have always been bigger
than other women, even if, as Marmaduke says, you have expanded
without shedding the husks of tradition."</p>
<p>"Does he say that? It is unkind of him." Already she was in
bed, and the linen sheet, with its embroidered design of twin
doves holding her monogram, was folded back over her bosom. For
an instant a retort trembled upon her lips beneath the shining
film of camphor ice. Then, remembering the weakness of her heart
and the secret martyrdom she was enduring for her family, she
shook her head while the resentment in her expression softened to
pity. "Do you think that is quite fair of Marmaduke?" she asked
plaintively. "Have you ever doubted my willingness to befriend
Milly Burden?"</p>
<p>"Good God, Victoria! Do you mean you would put her into your
refuge?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't mean that. I could find a place for her in which
she could earn her living and regain her self-respect without
being a constant cross to Mary Victoria. The child tells me that
she is afraid to go down to your office--or to send Martin."</p>
<p>"There's nothing to bring her to my office, and still less, I
hope, to bring Martin."</p>
<p>"It is impossible to have a serious discussion when you turn
everything to ridicule."</p>
<p>"Who asked, my dear, for a serious discussion? Not I."</p>
<p>"But how can you fail to accept your share of responsibility?
After all, you are the one who brought Mary Victoria and Martin
together."</p>
<p>The clear flush in his face was stained instantly with a dark
purple, and she thought fearfully of the men of his age who had
dropped dead on the golf-course and elsewhere. "I asked her to
look for the lover of another woman," he rejoined, almost
angrily. "I trusted her to be fair."</p>
<p>"You must have known, or I could have told you, that you were
taking a grave risk. Did it never occur to you that Mary Victoria
has some peculiar power over men? I sometimes think that her
platonic attitude only makes her attraction the more provocative.
But all the same," she insisted firmly, "I am convinced that she
would never have fallen in love with Martin had he not made her
believe that she was necessary to his salvation." Stout and
wifely, in her chaste cambric night-gown, she watched her husband
with a dispassionate gaze.</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage untied the cords of his dressing-gown and
settled himself wearily between the fragrant sheets. "It was a
pity she ever gave up missionary work," he said, reaching for a
small blue bottle and swallowing a digestive tablet. "In the
Congo she might have saved whole tribes without being obliged to
marry a single one of them."</p>
<p>"If you insist upon being frivolous, Virginius--"</p>
<p>"I insist upon nothing, my dear, not even upon the importance
of frivolity in marriage."</p>
<p>"What I am trying to tell you--" Closing her eyes, Victoria
breathed a silent prayer for patience. "What I am trying to tell
you is simply that Milly Burden would be much happier if she
could go away and begin life all over again."</p>
<p>"Well, she'd go like a shot, Victoria, if it were not for her
mother."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage opened her eyes. "What does her mother
do?"</p>
<p>"According to Marmaduke and Milly the lady's vocation
resembles Mary Victoria's. She is engaged in reforming the
world."</p>
<p>"What kind of reform, Virginius?"</p>
<p>"Her speciality, like Mary Victoria's, is character, though
she differs, it seems, in confining her energy to female
character."</p>
<p>"I could wish, Virginius, that you would choose some other
subject for flippancy. But I wonder," she added thoughtfully,
after a pause, "if she can be the very person for whom I am
looking."</p>
<p>"She? Do you mean Milly? I am positive that she is not."</p>
<p>"I mean her mother, of course. Is she perfectly
respectable?"</p>
<p>"So respectable, my dear, that Louisa is a fly-by-night beside
her."</p>
<p>"I wish you would not take that tone, Virginius, when I am
trying my best to think of some way to help the situation. Now,
if you are ready to put out the light, I will take time to
consider."</p>
<p>The light was put out, and turning on her side, Victoria
considered long after her husband had fallen asleep. She
considered first how dangerous a spirit of levity may become when
it refused to be controlled by religious beliefs, and secondly
she reflected that Virginius (though he made little trouble about
the more improbable articles of religion) was sadly lacking in
earnest conviction. After this, she moralized upon Mary
Victoria's unfortunate marriage, upon the infidelity and
intemperance of the youth of to-day, upon the danger of another
war in the near future, upon the general futility of the League
of Nations, upon the comfort of established beliefs, and upon the
moral value of a determination to look on the bright side and
hope for the best. And while she lay there, in her luxurious bed,
beneath the satin coverlet, which was scented with lavender, she
was aware, without surprise, that these meditations were merely
the formal patterns of inherited opinions. Like faded petals that
enclose the living heart of a flower, they were folded round a
radiant centre below the shifting surface of consciousness. They
might wither, these clustering leaves, they might even drop away,
and yet she knew that her deeper self, her hidden centre, would
remain inviolable. "All these things have their uses," she
thought, "but they are not really important."</p>
<p>And then, before falling asleep, she patiently mused upon the
inspirational needs of Mrs. Burden and the broad but specific
requirements of the House of Hope.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c207" id="c207">VII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes, this is the best, this is the only way," Victoria
repeated, as she ascended Mrs. Burden's steps the next afternoon.
While she had walked from Juniper Hill, for with her usual sound
judgment she had decided not to drive to the door, she had
rehearsed the approaching scene, and had learned by heart the
kind, but not too kind, words that she intended to speak. So
mechanical had the phrase become on her lips that, when she found
the bell beneath withered creepers, and Marmaduke unexpectedly
opened the door, she found herself still chanting, "I have come
in the hope that I might be of some help to you."</p>
<p>Cheerful, middle-aged, and still adventurous, Marmaduke glared
at her, through enormous spectacles, with eyes that made her
think of a cynical owl. In his shabby clothes he seemed to her,
while her accurate glance counted the spots on his waistcoat, a
mere bundle of deplorable habits. Then he removed his disfiguring
glasses, and she observed that his eyes were as bright and blue
as they had been in his youth and that the skin of his face and
throat was still fresh and ruddy.</p>
<p>"Well, that's kind of you, Victoria," he returned, holding the
door open with his crutch, while she passed in and stood looking
up at him in the greenish light of the hall. "I am glad," he
added in a genial tone, "that you do not harbour resentment."</p>
<p>Standing at the foot of the dim stairs, she glanced round her
with an ineradicable suspicion. "I have no resentment against
you, Marmaduke," she answered sincerely, "but my heart has been
weak since my illness last winter, and I doubt if I am equal to
that long flight of stairs. However, I'll try," she added in a
conciliatory tone, "if you'll let me go very slowly."</p>
<p>"As slowly as you please, Victoria. There won't be anybody
else using the stairs this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Are you alone in the house?"</p>
<p>"No, but I'm the only lodger at present, and Mrs. Burden and
Milly are content to be private. The maid of all work will not
come up until she brings mydinner."</p>
<p>Holding her black satin skirt as decorously as fashion
permitted, Victoria climbed as far as the second floor. Though
she dreaded to be alone with Marmaduke, she felt that urgent need
of protecting him from his own nature which she entertained in
regard to every member of the male sex. No matter how large in
person or eminent in public virtues a man might be, she had never
encountered one who was not dependent, even when he was unaware
of it, upon the chivalry of women. It was this chivalry that
prompted her to take advantage of any opportunity to win
Marmaduke from his low ideals and his still lower acquaintances.
"If only I could exert some purifying influence," she thought,
casting an apprehensive look over her shoulder down the dark
hall. "If only I could make him see the real meaning of life."
The real meaning of life! Eagerly she grasped the phrase. Her
mind, which was airy and spacious and honey-combed with
platitudes, was suddenly illuminated by hope.</p>
<p>"I wonder if you would mind going ahead," she said at last,
feeling safer with Marmaduke hobbling in front of her. "I am
obliged to take my time on account of my heart, and you are so
wonderful with your artificial leg." It was only natural to
suspect that a man of his character, especially when he was
endowed with artistic insight as well, would be disposed to see
more than he ought to see of any woman.</p>
<p>"I'm doing a portrait of Virginius now," Marmaduke said, while
he steadied himself on the stairs. "Not a likeness, you
understand, but a study in shadows. I wanted to catch those jolly
purple shadows in Virginius's face."</p>
<p>Purple shadows! And of all unexpected corners, to look for
them in the face of Virginius! "But there aren't any," she
returned, with her still lovely and ingenuous smile. "I am sure
if there had been, I should have noticed them. Virginius has
always had an unusually fine complexion."</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't have seen them; but by the time I've
finished with them, you may admit that the shadows in a man's
face are more significant than anything that he says."</p>
<p>What an unbalanced mind! What an ignoble vision! It was
incomprehensible to her that any Virginian, born of the great
tradition, with an inalienable right to enjoy the best people,
should prefer to spend his time in the social backwater of
Queenborough. With this wonder overshadowing her aversion from
his indelicacy, she rejoined in a tone of gentle rebuke:</p>
<p>"At least you will not deny that I know Virginius better than
anyone else could."</p>
<p>"Yes, Victoria, I am obliged to deny that." Though his eyes
were laughing, his sensual lips, which always embarrassed her, as
if they were improperly exposed by his beard, had become as grave
as a philosopher's. "I admit that you know the husband; but the
husband is very far from the beginning and the end of a man."</p>
<p>She looked hurt but forgiving. "I am satisfied that he keeps
nothing from me. The thing that I am most grateful for in my life
is that I have been able to make Virginius happy."</p>
<p>"Yes, you've done as much as one woman could, my dear
sister."</p>
<p>A frown hardened her gentle features. "Are you implying that
my husband is leading a double life, Marmaduke?"</p>
<p>"No, Victoria. I am implying that, like every other man, he is
leading a quadruple one. Four secret lives aren't too many to
allow a man when you consider the millions of predatory cells of
which he is composed."</p>
<p>Though she entertained only a natural dislike for Marmaduke
when he was absent, there were occasions in his presence when she
understood, as she had once confessed to Louisa, why women so
frequently murdered men. Not that she herself, she had hastened
to explain, ever felt the slightest inclination to violence;
simply that she could understand, at such moments, why other
women had been unable to restrain their more choleric
temperaments. Out of the depth of this comprehension, she
remarked frigidly, "On the contrary, Virginius has been always as
open as the day with me."</p>
<p>Marmaduke shook his head with the droll gesture that had made
so much trouble for her as a bride. "Not with those shadows,
Victoria. His guilty secrets are written in his face for any
observant painter to read. Come up and tell me what you think of
my portrait. There aren't many occasions in life when a man wants
the truth from a woman, but this happens to be one of them."</p>
<p>How could she, how could any woman tell, Victoria asked
herself, whether Marmaduke was making fun of her intelligence or
merely preserving his reputation as a buffoon? As she followed
him up the staircase, which seemed to her dangerously insecure,
she reminded herself that she had long ago resolved not to take
him too seriously. Nevertheless, it was impossible to deny that
the steep climb to his studio was strewn with conjectures. At the
top of the stairs the band of sunlight was spreading, and in the
middle of the studio Marmaduke, who had neatly whisked a decanter
and a couple of glasses out of sight, stood waiting for her.</p>
<p>"You've never done me so much honour before, my dear sister.
If I had expected you, I might have arranged a more flattering
reception."</p>
<p>"Please don't bother, Marmaduke. What lovely sunshine!"</p>
<p>Standing there, while her eyes swept his pictures, she looked
in vain for some object that she might admire without doing
violence either to her womanly instincts or her religious
convictions. Why, she found herself wondering, did Marmaduke, and
indeed so many other modern artists, for the failing appeared to
be general in art, insist upon painting only the more unpleasant
aspects of Nature? And apart from the mere indecency of his
subjects, she doubted, as emphatically as Virginius had done a
few weeks before, if the figures of even improper women, when
they were undressed, were really as red or purple as he painted
them. Moreover, what was the use, she concluded triumphantly, in
painting a picture or writing a book that did not help to make
the world better?" There's Virginius over there on that easel,"
he waved in the direction of the window. "What do you make of
it?"</p>
<p>"Make of it?" Her reply was a wail. "Why, that isn't
Virginius. You're painting raw flesh."</p>
<p>"You don't like it?" He was obviously disappointed. "You can't
see a likeness?"</p>
<p>"There isn't the remotest suggestion of Virginius. Oh,
Marmaduke," her vehemence ebbed in a murmur of protest. "I can't
see any good that it serves to go on painting these things over
and over. Of course," she continued, with simple dignity, "I
don't pretend to know much about art, but I do love beauty." She
closed her eyes as she spoke because the brilliant sunshine
clashing with these intemperate colours gave her a sensation of
giddiness. Why had she never suspected that so many violent
shocks could be wrung out of apparently insignificant tubes of
paint?</p>
<p>"Do you?" Supporting himself against the table, Marmaduke
smiled down on her as he waved a dirty remnant of black cloth in
his free hand. "Well, that's too deep for me. I am not a
philosopher, I am merely a painter. All I am trying to do is to
get in touch with some form of reality."</p>
<p>"But do you believe that reality is obliged to be ugly?"</p>
<p>"I believe nothing. I paint what I see. If you choose to call
it ugliness instead of beauty, that isn't my fault. You must
blame it either upon an act of God or a miscarriage of
Nature."</p>
<p>"We were taught when I was young," Victoria remonstrated
gently, "that truth is beauty."</p>
<p>"I know we were, my dear sister. That is part of our
trouble."</p>
<p>She sighed with unresentful patience. "But, surely, you cannot
enjoy looking at such unpleasant subjects?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Victoria. Candidly, I don't know. I suppose it
all depends upon how much or how little you see of an object.
Most things aren't beautiful if you look below the skin or the
rind. Human beings are certainly not, nor, for that matter, is
human nature. On the contrary, pomegranates are beautiful even
when you cut into them; but one can scarcely go on painting
pomegranates for ever. I'd rather, if the choice is mine, take a
chance away from æsthetics to truth. After all, it is life I am
working on, not decoration. I am trying with every stroke to get
as far away as possible from all the smugness and priggishness we
were brought up to believe in. For the last few days I have been
trying to see what Virginius would look like if the old Virginia
gentleman were wiped out of his face."</p>
<p>"But isn't the quality you call smugness and priggishness
simply what the best people everywhere think of as religion?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps. That is what I am trying to find out."</p>
<p>"Oh, Marmaduke," she pleaded more sweetly, "what good can
possibly come from finding out what ought not to be true?"</p>
<p>"I cannot answer, Victoria. I don't know anything. It might, I
suppose, shake us out of our moral complacency."</p>
<p>"But," she held to her principle with more than usual
tenacity, "isn't there a chance that we may be complacent only
because we know that we are right? After all, hasn't Christianity
survived the ages?"</p>
<p>His blue eyes were squinting in the sunshine, and a smile of
artless merriment puckered the carnivorous lips within the
silvery sheen of his beard. While her delicacy shuddered away
from him, he inquired pleasantly, "Have you ever given a thought,
Victoria, to what the shape of a platitude would be if it assumed
a symbolic form? If you were drawing one, for example, would you
make it round, oval, or square? An oblate sphere? Or simply a
hollow square? No, I'm not teasing you, my dear. I am really in
earnest. After all, you are one of the few persons I've known for
whom I've never lost my respect. It is true that your heart is
very far in advance of your head; but when you are remembered, it
will be by the heart, not the head, of the future."</p>
<p>The flush of indignation faded slowly from Victoria's
features. Even her early training, which had prepared her to
soothe the tired brow and tame the predatory nature of man, had
failed to anticipate the sharper thrust of intelligence. In her
youth all that a lady needed to learn, after she had acquired the
art of smiling above a wasp-waist, was the easier process of how
to become an edifying example. As a bride, she had fervently
longed to soothe and tame, as well as inspire, Virginius; and
though she would have died sooner than admit the fact, the first
year of her marriage might have been less disappointing if he had
magnanimously cultivated a lower nature. Those were the months,
before Duncan was born, when her beauty was in its angelic
perfection, and Marmaduke had facetiously compared her to Una
with a lamb in a lion's skin.</p>
<p>As she recalled this unseemly jest, her matronly expression
became more severe, and she remarked coldly, "It is getting late,
Marmaduke, and I should like to have a few words with Mrs. Burden
before I go. Could you ring the bell and ask if she is at
home?"</p>
<p>He looked at her in astonishment. "Do you mean that you wish
to see Mrs. Burden?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. Why not?"</p>
<p>"No reason whatever. Only it seems a strange thing to
wish."</p>
<p>"I understand," her voice wavered, "that she is perfectly
respectable."</p>
<p>"She is more than respectable. She is estimable; she is an
ennobling influence."</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Littlepage was always suspicious of Marmaduke, his
description of Mrs. Burden impressed her as favourable rather
than otherwise. "If she is indeed that, I am sure that she is the
very person we need. Has she, are you aware, a particular
vocation?"</p>
<p>"Only, I believe, for making the world better."</p>
<p>This again, in spite of his levity, might be considered
encouraging. "It wouldn't surprise me," observed Victoria, who
was hopeful but contained, "if she should turn out to be the
ideal matron."</p>
<p>"Matron? Of what? Is it a Sunday school?"</p>
<p>"Please don't try to be funny. We are looking for an assistant
matron for our House of Hope. It was founded by your mother, and
used to be called, you remember, the Home for Unfortunates. We
receive wayward girls after a first offence."</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember." He looked as grave, she said to herself,
with relief, as a judge on the bench. "But I doubt if waywardness
would have slightest attraction for Mrs. Burden. Why don't you
try Mary Victoria?"</p>
<p>"Marmaduke!" The dark flush, which was far from becoming,
stained Victoria's smooth cheeks and melted into the even waves
of hair on her forehead. "There are times when you forget
yourself."</p>
<p>"Unhappily, Victoria, I forget myself less often as I grow
older. I still, however, hold by my opinion that waywardness
makes a stronger appeal to Mary Victoria than to Mrs.
Burden."</p>
<p>"Will you oblige me, Marmaduke, by leaving Mary Victoria out
of our discussion. Though I regret her unsuitable marriage, I can
still respect the purity of her motives. And now, if it isn't
asking too much, will you tell me how I may find Mrs.
Burden?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll find her for you, if you are determined. But,
honestly, don't you think you have done Milly enough harm without
this?"</p>
<p>"Harm? Why, I am trying to help her win back her
self-respect."</p>
<p>"She has never lost it, Victoria. I assure you that she has as
much self-respect as you or I or Mrs. Burden could possibly help
her to attain."</p>
<p>"But doesn't she know that, in the eyes of the world at least,
she is a ruined woman?"</p>
<p>"My dear sister, she doesn't even suspect it. As far as she is
concerned, the world might have been born amblyopic. Whether you
realize it or not, being ruined is not a biological fact, but a
state of mind. It may sound paradoxical to any survivor of the
nineteenth century, but Milly has proved to me that it is
impossible to ruin a woman as long as she isn't aware of it. What
really ruined poor Aunt Agatha--yes, and Mrs. Dalrymple, too--was
not a fall from virtue, but Victorian psychology. You--by that I
mean public opinion in Queenborough and elsewhere--were
inoculated with the Puritan virus."</p>
<p>She had reached the door, and after passing out into the hall,
she remarked with a composure she was far from feeling, "I refuse
to admit, Marmaduke, that moral principles are merely sports of
the ages. No one could have pitied poor Aunt Agatha more than I;
but the severity of her punishment almost fifty years ago does
not justify us in lowering the standards of Queenborough today.
After all, the world, even the modern world, must cling to
something or perish. Even the extremest revolt of youth is
scarcely more than a tempest in--in--" the triteness of metaphor
checked the flow of her eloquence, and Marmaduke proffered
softly:</p>
<p>"In a fruit-jar?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in a fruit-jar, if you are determined to be flippant,"
she assented, with dignity. "But, after all, you must remember
that the future of American civilization is in the hands of the
mothers. It is an affront to American motherhood to imply that it
is unfaithful to its responsibilities."</p>
<p>She paused abruptly with the feeling that Marmaduke had pushed
her back, politely but firmly, into the rustling void between
time and eternity. "I am saying these things because they are the
only words that I know," she thought, "but words are not real.
Thoughts are not real. They are only the folded leaves of
something that is hidden within."</p>
<p>"I dare say you are right, Victoria," Marmaduke replied, with
a weary shrug, "and it is on this entirely appropriate note that
I should like to introduce you to Mrs. Burden."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c208" id="c208">VIII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>All that bright and windy afternoon Mrs. Burden sat before her
fire and knitted one of the sad-coloured garments in which
evangelical Christianity wraps original sin. While she knitted
her lean but active thoughts addressed the God of Genesis, and
demanded some act of divine intervention in her affairs. For she
had had, as she eagerly testified, a mean life from the hour of
her birth; and after sixty-five years of complaining submission
to the will of God, it seemed to her more than time for God to do
something about it. Though she was familiar with the Book of Job
and the inscrutable ways of Providence in Scripture, she still
felt that she had been punished too long and too harshly for the
transgressions of others. Even in childhood, for she had been a
pious infant, and disposed to become an early example, she had
attended church twice every Sunday and once in the middle of
every week. Moreover, as she had not failed to point out, this
devoutness had occurred at a stage of the world's history when
attendance upon divine service exacted a robust constitution.</p>
<p>At the moment, so profound was her melancholy, she would have
agreed with Mrs. Littlepage that being conventional (only she
called it "keeping respectable") was by no means so easy as
loose-living persons of the past had seemed to imagine. It is
true that she had been blessed, among other favours, by the
serenity of mind which is the spiritual property of those who are
unacquainted with doubt. Yet the wonder grew, as years went by,
that amazing grace, which has so sweet a sound, should appear to
increase rather than diminish the struggles of Nature. For even
she had not been spared (though it was almost fifty years ago)
the hopeless pangs of an unfortunate love. In April evenings,
when the scent of lilacs drifted like rain on the silver air, she
had walked with a lover among the tender whispers of the delicate
green twilights. He was unredeemed; he was disreputable; he was a
hopeless fugitive from the Blood of the Lamb; yet she had walked
with him all those April evenings, and she had loved him in
secret through the other months of the year. In spite of his
sins, which were as scarlet, and his circumstances, which were
beggarly, she might have been faithful to him, if only he had
respected her. Everything else, even his poverty, she could have
forgiven, if only he had respected her virtue. For almost half a
century this thought had lodged there, driven by that old anguish
into some obscure recess of memory. She could have forgiven him
everything else, if only he had respected her. Sitting there by
her scant fire, with her ashen skin, her upright old body, and
her unconquerable spirit; sitting there in her attitude of bleak
resignation, she felt resentfully that, though she bowed to the
will of God, her life wouldn't bear thinking about. After almost
fifty years (and God alone knew what those years had meant to
her), there were recollections that still hurt her pride like the
sting of a hornet. Those warm April evenings, when she put on her
blue dress (they were wearing trains then, and a great many
flounces), and believed she was being an ideal to an unworthy but
infatuated young man. There were curls on her neck and an
Alsatian bow in place of a bonnet, and there was not a thought in
her mind that wasn't as pure as snow and a credit to any ideal.
Walking out in the flushed light, and thinking all the sad and
pious thoughts that came to her in the spring, especially when it
was Sunday and warmer than usual, and she was close to an
unconverted but attractive young man, who was in danger of losing
his soul.</p>
<p>The thoughts were in her mind when she had tripped out into
the road by the lilacs, prepared to spread the Gospel and bring
salvation to this young man, who was unworthy but loved her. For
an instant, in the dying glow of flames, these two memories
touched and melted as shadows touch and melt into an empty
embrace. All those ages before, in her blue dress with the
flounces, wearing an Alsatian bow on her chestnut curls, she
tripped down the pale road between white and purple cluster of
lilacs. With the purest motives, she had walked out, suspecting
no evil. Suspecting no evil from men, suspecting no evil from
fate, trusting in God and the institution of marriage, keeping
herself, in her blue dress, as remote as an ideal. Through all
the wind and mist of time, she could look back and remember the
warm scent of the lilacs and a white star shining down on her
pure thoughts, which were occupied with the salvation of sinners.
Pure as a lily she had walked out; and when they reached the
first bench in the park, beneath the great elm that was cut down
a few years ago (she could never understand, no woman could
understand, how men enjoy cutting down trees), this young man had
proved that he did not respect her. Yes, there were things in the
past, there were April evenings, there were drifting scents,
there were hopes, there were disappointments, there was love,
there was bitterness, there was outraged modesty and rejected
salvation--there were all these things in the past, and none of
them would bear thinking about. Life was like that, she supposed.
In spite of amazing grace and being washed in the Blood of the
Lamb (Milly said it was horrible to drag blood into religion),
life wouldn't bear thinking about. For her happiness had been a
mistake. Her love had been a mistake from the beginning, and
when, years afterwards, she had married a man who respected her,
that had turned out to be an even greater mistake. But how could
a woman know? How could any woman know that life wouldn't bear
thinking about? For, though he still respected her, she had been
deserted for a loose woman, after bearing seven children and
losing six of them. He had deserted her for a loose woman; yet he
had nothing he could complain of in his marriage except, as he
had told her to her face, that his wife had never failed in her
duty. But it was true. He knew it when he left her. She had never
failed in her duty. And that also, though people who had no sense
of duty were fond of saying otherwise, had not been easy. Doing
your duty day and night by a man who respected you while he
enjoyed loose-living women, had not been easy. But she had
struggled on. Deserted, she had still struggled on and prepared
her daughter for the hour of temptation. For there were lions in
the path of all pure womanhood; and the station to which
Providence had called her (though superior in right thinking to
the profligate society that had ruined Miss Agatha Littlepage)
was infested, as the preacher proclaimed every Sunday, with
devourers of innocence.</p>
<p>Never, not even after forty-seven years, had she forgotten the
prayer of thanksgiving for her own escape which she had breathed
when she heard that the daughter of old General Littlepage had
been betrayed by a Southern gentleman, who moved in the best
circles, but was married already. Married already, and therefore
unable, as well as indisposed, to make an honest woman of Miss
Agatha Littlepage. For genteel conduct decreed that even the most
prodigal Southern gentleman is unable to make an honest woman of
more than one Southern lady at a time. Forty-seven years ago, yet
it seemed only yesterday! It seemed only yesterday that she had
tingled with horror and indignation and gratitude for her own
escape from the snare of the fowler. "This came," scoffed her
father (a plain man, and proud of it), "as a punishment for round
dances and wine-bibbing and bare necks in the evening, and
neglecting to hold religious revivals in the spring of the year."
"This came," moaned her mother (a simple woman, and proud of it),
"from forgetting your modesty and failing to spurn the brazen
instincts of men." "This came," thundered her pastor (the voice
of God, though a worm, and proud of it), "from braving divine
wrath and embracing the frivolous dogmas and the Popish
ceremonies of the Episcopal Church." For poor Miss Agatha had
stooped to folly in an earnest age; and churches had learned
politeness, if they had lost members, since the great elm was cut
down in the park. To Mrs. Burden, who had survived the changing
morals of two generations, and naturally took a mournful view of
human affairs, there appeared a sounder logic in the severe
decorum and the iron-bound theology of her youth. From her humble
station, thankful for a decent obscurity, she had surveyed the
higher circles of Queenborough, and had watched the unfolding of
certain notorious scandals. Fearfully she had watched. Fearfully
and hopefully she had watched for divine retribution. Miss
Agatha, it is true, had been punished, however inadequately; but
Mrs. Burden could only shudder in spirit when she recalled the
ease with which Mrs. Dalrymple had safely wriggled past the wages
of sin. But for that slipperiness (for hadn't she lived to enjoy
immorality instead of paying the penalty for it like poor Miss
Agatha?), Mrs. Burden might have kept her own incorrigible
daughter straight in the path of duty and the pious fear of the
Lord.</p>
<p>"I could understand it better if I had left anything undone,"
sighed Mrs. Burden. But, search the past as diligently as she was
able, there was nothing, not so much as the merest shadow of
neglect, with which she could reproach herself. What did it all
prove in the end, she inquired now of an inattentive Providence,
except that the severest upbringing is powerless to eradicate a
paternal strain of depravity? Though the influence of home had
been impeccable, Milly had no sooner started to work, or so it
appeared to the morose vision of her mother, than she had rushed
into sin. For the worst of it was, Mrs. Burden lamented over her
knitting, that she had fallen not heavily, like poor Miss Agatha,
nor even lightly, like the slippery Mrs. Dalrymple, but quite
naturally, as if it were her own private affair. If she had been
taught evil instead of good all her life, she could not, Mrs.
Burden felt, have been ruined more easily. If she had been taught
that life is a bed of roses, not a vale of sorrow, and that she
herself was called to be a butterfly instead of a worm, she could
not, in her mother's opinion, have flown more airily over the
bottomless pit. And, as if her sin were not wanton enough, she
had crowned her delinquency, mused Mrs. Burden, who was partial
to dignified words, by her obstinate refusal to acknowledge her
ruin or to remain where she had fallen. Boldly, in the most
brazen defiance of virtue, she had risen again to her feet. "My
life is my own," she had said. "My life is my own." Nothing more.
That was her answer to the mother who had brought her into the
world. "My life is my own." If she had ever repented; if she had
confessed her guilty passion; if she had abased herself before
God and her injured mother, Mrs. Burden told herself that she
should have enjoyed lifting her up and leading her, with contrite
heart, to the throne of Grace. But, composed, capable, defiant,
Milly had taken up her life where she had left it off, and the
age had encouraged her! That, groaned Mrs. Burden, was the
bitterest drop in her cup of woe, the age had encouraged sin, the
age had encouraged hardness of heart. An irreligious and
licentious age had abetted depravity. In the sedate 'seventies a
woman, even a woman who was also, as in the case of Miss Agatha
Littlepage, a Southern lady, had known what to expect whenever
she felt a temptation to stray from the thorny path of propriety.
If anybody doubted that to-day, Mrs. Burden reflected sadly, he
had only to take a look at what happened after Miss Agatha's
fall. Even pure womanhood, it seemed, required stout doctrines
and a heavy hand to put the proper fear of God into its bosom;
and you had only to glance about you to realize that the world
had never been so well governed since the belief in eternal
damnation had been taken away. No matter how far-sighted you had
become from age and other infirmities (Heaven alone knew what she
had suffered from sciatica, and her joints, too, had grown so
stiff that she could barely put on her clothes or hold her
knitting-needles)--but no matter how blind you were to things
near at hand, you couldn't help seeing that sin wasn't all that
it used to be. It had always been like that, her father used to
point out, in what he called, with his jocose manner, high
society. Perhaps it had been; you could never tell where people
would end when they went after pleasure. Not that she had ever
bothered much with that kind of society, though her family, for
that matter, was as good as the rest of them, only more quiet.
But she had heard things and watched, too, in her day, and she
wouldn't have been in poor Miss Agatha's shoes for all the pride
(which was false anyway) of those Littlepages. They had even
taken her baby away from her, which was proper, of course, since
it had been conceived in sin, and nobody had ever found out what
they did with it. Sent it out of Virginia, some people said,
though there were a few who went so far as to believe the
fantastic tale of the old cinderwoman, Aunt Methuselara,
addle-pate and half blind, who hinted darkly that she had found
the body of a naked infant at the bottom of a barrel of ashes.
Not many had credited that coarse version, however, and Mrs.
Burden, though she suspected any enormity of people who drank
mint juleps after church every Sabbath, concluded charitably that
Aunt Methuselara's half-wit must have wholly deserted her. But,
even if you declined to go that far, poor Miss Agatha had been
punished severely enough to make her go in fear of sin all the
rest of her life.</p>
<p>This, to be sure, was not contending, as some people did, that
the child had been strangled the minute after it came into the
world. This was not even contending (for Mrs. Burden governed her
mind) that poor Miss Agatha ought to have gone to an asylum for
mental defectives. Gossip of this nature had reached Mrs. Burden,
but she had never stooped to repeat it. Still, it was useless to
deny that, even with these extreme penalties suspended, the
Victorian era was scarcely an age that one would have picked out
for sinful purposes. Though a delicate sense of style refined the
tongue, and Mrs. Burden had never heard the word "adultery"
except in the Ten Commandments, she was perfectly aware that the
American Republic has as little use for a repentant Magdalen as
it has for a king's mistress. Even Mrs. Dalrymple, who looked as
much like a king's mistress as if she had stepped straight out of
profane history, had been obliged to seek moral climes more
congenial in profligate Europe. It is true that she had held her
head high, and had done her best (though not so much as Milly) to
brazen out her disgrace; but in the nineteenth century, even at
the very end of it, a woman had at least known when she was
ruined. Many times in the last twenty years she had returned to
fight the battle over again. Always a little older, a little
heavier, a little more painted, but still beautiful in her vulgar
style, she had returned to flaunt her gilded shame in the
presence of the stout matrons and lean virgins of Queenborough.
Several times on her way home with Milly after divine service,
Mrs. Burden had beheld the flamboyant sinner vivaciously holding
her own in one of the Sunday parades from St. Luke's Episcopal
Church. "It makes me blush to look at her," Mrs. Burden had
protested, and Milly had replied in her mocking tone, "But she is
still very handsome. Wouldn't you rather look like her than look
at her, poor dear?" Well, morals had crumbled with a vengeance,
there was no use denying it. Only yesterday Mrs. Burden had heard
(though she had refused to believe it) that the Home for
Unfortunates had changed its name because it feared to wound the
pride of the wayward. That was the home old Mrs. Littlepage (and
no wonder) had been so active in establishing. Mrs. Burden had
been told on the best authority (though she herself knew nothing
of such places, and would never think of entering one from vulgar
curiosity) that instead of keeping lost women down on their
knees, with a scrubbing-brush and a bucket of soapsuds, the board
of visitors went so far as to supply them with many profane
amusements. For weeks, after she had first discovered Milly's
guilt, Mrs. Burden had urged her daughter to hide her shame in
some such haven of rescue; but Milly, supported by an
unprincipled age, had relapsed into her mood of solitary
defiance. Only once had her composure deserted her, and that was
when she had braced her courage to the point of borrowing money
from her employer. Naturally, he also had encouraged her, and
with a generosity of which Mrs. Burden suspected the worst, he
had received an unmarried mother (though the encumbrance had been
providentially removed) into what had appeared to be a
respectable office. Not only, Mrs. Burden mused suspiciously, had
he employed Milly after her trouble, but he had even increased
her salary in a situation in which women are usually grateful for
the stale bread of charity. "She is as capable as a man," Mr.
Littlepage had explained, for that was the way they had talked in
war time. "Any woman as capable as that need never scrub for a
living." But was it really, sniffed Mrs. Burden, nosing
delicately into the matter, Milly's competence or her appearance
that had worked on his nature? For, to Mrs. Burden's constant
humiliation, Milly had been born with the sort of face that
awakes evil desires in unsuitable bosoms. Even on the girl's
plainest days (for her beauty was the kind that oozed and died
like a dark flame) she exerted, without the slightest effort
apparently, an improper influence over sober husbands and
dignified fathers. Not that many men required such an influence,
Mrs. Burden admitted, as she remembered that April evening with
the young man who had taken a liberty. Yet, all things
considered, it was a misfortune that her daughter was not more
subdued in appearance. For it was a hard world at best, and a
woman who worked for a living could not afford to have a face
that made men think (so she had heard one of them exclaim) of
moonlight on magnolia blossoms. Yes, she had had her trials, Mrs.
Burden remarked aloud, as she picked up her knitting, which had
slipped to the floor, and not for a million dollars would she
consent to live her life over again. She had nothing with which
she could reproach herself; she had done the best she could with
her lot; but not for a million dollars in gold would she consent
to live her life over again.</p>
<p>Sitting there, alone and very erect, by her smothered fire,
with her head bent over the long swift needles, which moved with
a monotonous click as the grey yarn unwound from the ball and was
interlooped into stitches, it seemed to her that she was drowning
in misery. No, not for anything that the world could give would
she live her life over again. Yet she did not wish to die; she
did not wish to grow old and wait there, at pause with living,
until the wind whispered in the fading glow of the embers, the
skein slackened, and the knitting-needles dropped from her hands.
Already she could feel those dark dregs of age settling over her,
while the past ebbed and flowed in the room and out again into
the winter evening, into the world, into the universe. Yet she
was not really old; she was not finished. There was life in her
bones yet, she thought valiantly, only she had to struggle to
keep on her feet, and being respectable was not so easy as it
seemed to some people.</p>
<p>But the loneliness, she thought after a moment of vacancy--the
loneliness, that was the worst of life, that was the worst of
being old and waiting for death. Not that she was really old,
when you stopped to think of her age. Plenty of women were still
active at sixty-five. Plenty of women still went after pleasure,
and she had heard, though it was hard to credit this, that, since
the Great War, some of these women even went after lovers. Well,
thank Heaven, she had no need now, she had never had an urgent
need, either of love or lovers. Though you couldn't have made her
believe it forty-seven years ago, she was thankful now to have
finished with all that. But she was alone too much, and she had
reached the time of life and the state of mind when conversation
is more agreeable than any form of activity. Yes, she was alone
too much of the day, and the night also. That was what happened,
she supposed, when you married the wrong man and were deserted
but not made a widow. For she was deserted now all the time. She
was lonely and neglected and rheumatic, though her life stretched
back, beneath those dark dregs of age, to a girl in a blue dress
with whom a young man had taken a liberty. Bleak, withered,
austere, she was still a woman with whom a young man had taken a
liberty. At one end of that slackened fibre, she knitted grey
yarn with crippled fingers, and at the other end she walked with
pure thoughts in the April dusk, and a young man was taking a
liberty. What was the meaning of it all? she wondered,
interlooping the grey yarn on her knitting-needles. What was the
meaning of it? Where was it leading? Two women and yet the same
woman, and a single life. Which was her real self, the girl in a
blue dress resenting a liberty, or the old woman by the fire, who
was beyond love, beyond liberties, beyond everything but eating
and drinking? You couldn't tell. No woman could tell which was
real, the clear past or the dim present. No woman, not even the
oldest, could tell what life meant. But it was the same life,
after all; it was the same life, rippling, sparkling, or
smothered there under that thick mound of ashes. It was the same
life, and it was hers. It was hers, and what she learned from it
was that keeping respectable was not so easy as some people
imagine--<i>But not for anything that the world could give would
she live her life over again . . .</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c209" id="c209">IX</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Poor woman, she must be lonely," Mrs. Littlepage thought, as
she drifted in on that spent wave of the past which was still
flooding the room. For the faintest sign, the barest glimpse, of
misery awakened in Victoria's bosom an ardent desire to soothe,
to ease, to comfort, and, if necessary, to convert to some higher
ideal. It was not, as she often assured herself, that she ever
wished to meddle in another person's affairs. But she was so
constituted that it was impossible for her to live in the world,
it was impossible even for her to sit in a room, without
observing how many objects needed to be changed and straightened
and put right before people could begin to be comfortable. And so
she thought, seeing Mrs. Burden alone in front of the fire, which
needed replenishing, "Poor woman, I wonder what I can do for
her!" It was this benevolent impulse, she knew, this expanding
and flowering of the maternal instinct into a vital sense of
compassion, that made persons who did not understand her (and
Marmaduke, she admitted sadly, was one of these) imagine that she
was sometimes without tact, that she was too interfering, that
she was never happy except when she was improving something or
somebody. No, it was not really meddling; she was not always
trying to manage the world, she assured herself, while she held
out her hand and said in soothing tones, "I hope I am not
disturbing you, Mrs. Burden."</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden, who feared loneliness and enjoyed being
disturbed, put down her knitting and struggled to her feet, with
an apology for the appearance of the room and her simple manner
of living. "When I was young we never thought of having a servant
to answer the doorbell," she said, with a dismal smile, before
she turned away to make up the fire.</p>
<p>"Why, I am sure it is all very nice," Mrs. Littlepage replied
brightly, as she sat down in a rocking-chair on the opposite side
of the hearth. "A fire looks so cosy on a frosty night. It must
be hard," she added, glancing cheerfully round her, "to keep this
big house warm in a snow-storm." Again she thought sadly, "Poor
soul, her life must have been dreadfully bitter. How ashen and
withered and hopeless she looks. It is all the more to her credit
that she has been able to hold on to her religious
conviction."</p>
<p>Had Mrs. Burden heard her visitor's thoughts instead of her
words, she might have answered her remarks to some purpose and
have told her more about religious conviction than any member of
St. Luke's Episcopal Church was ever likely to know. For Kesiah
Agnes Watkins, now Mrs. Burden, had been converted in the ages of
faith when conversion meant something; and her father was an
intrepid circuit-rider in the days when circuits were dangerous
and riders men of stout bone and sinew. Yes, she was growing old
(though sixty-five is still middle-aged), and she had known what
trouble was in her life; but she could tell Mrs. Littlepage a
thing or two about religious conviction.</p>
<p>"I hope you manage to keep your health, Mrs. Burden."</p>
<p>"I've always been strong, and but for rheumatism in my joints
and that spell of sciatica last winter, I'd be as active as ever.
I've had a mean life, if I do say it, and afflictions enough to
try the patience of Job; but I've still a few things left to be
thankful for."</p>
<p>"Well, that's a beautiful way to look at your troubles. It is
so important, I think, to remember that we have always a few
things left to be thankful for." Victoria's cloudless gaze dimmed
while she laid a sympathetic hand on the ball of grey yarn. Not
only a beautiful way to look at trouble, but the very vision she
had tried to cultivate in the spiritless inmates of the House of
Hope. How often in her Wednesday talks to the wayward had she
reminded her hearers of the moral value that resides in a
cheerful point of view. Certainly, the judgment of the ages has
decided that optimism is meritorious in nature; and where it has
few facts to support it, as in the case of saints or martyrs or
minds that are poor but honest, it appears only to acquire a
miraculous virtue. In Mrs. Burden's situation, which included
poverty, ill-treatment, and disgrace, surely to continue to look
on the bright side and hope for the best was nothing less than
heroic. "Your faith must be a great comfort to you," she
concluded aloud, and astonished herself by thinking immediately
afterwards, "but these things are not really important. They are
only words, and words are as empty as withered rinds."</p>
<p>Without moving her head, Mrs. Burden shifted in her chair,
moistened her pale dry lips, and turned her opaque eyes on her
visitor. Since she had never, within her recollection, been
anywhere but in trouble, she was not impressed by the reminder;
and it appeared to her, when she stopped to think of it, that
Mrs. Littlepage had inaccurately defined her religion. "I don't
mean that I've ever taken things lightly," she corrected, with a
touch of asperity. "I know I've had a mean life, and a crooked
one. There are times when it seems to me that my whole life was
cut on the bias." Grimly, without smiling, but with what Mrs.
Littlepage could only regard as a monumental patience, she took
up her work, and the long knitting-needles clicked while the grey
yarn interlooped in the firelight. How indestructible she looked
in spite of her leanness! Gaunt, grizzled, dark-browed, and as
inscrutable as a cedar-tree; yet with a humming vitality in her
branches, as if life sang in her for a moment of time before it
flew on into the whispering flames and the murmurous December
twilight. "What an odd idea!" Mrs. Littlepage thought, with
surprise. "I never used to think such incredible things. The
truth is that everything has been different and nothing has
seemed real since my illness last winter." Aloud, she replied
gently, "There are times, I suppose, when all of us feel that our
lives were cut on the bias." Her face was beaming with sympathy,
and there was a quiver of happiness in her beautiful voice.
Sweeping through her, and submerging all memory of the cruelties
and contradictions of life, like some blissful rhythm and change
of being, she was aware of this rising tide of compassion. Once
again, she had found herself; once again, she was renewed,
refreshed, and replenished, at some inexhaustible source which
was deeper than thought and more real than words.</p>
<p>"I believe I can help you," she said softly, while a mystic
joy, an infusion of sparkling energy, permeated her
consciousness, spreading in rivulets of light, scattering a
rainbow spray through her mind and soul. "Yes, I am sure I shall
be able to help you."</p>
<p>"I don't know any reason on earth why I should have had so
much trouble," Mrs. Burden was repeating, in an impressive
monotone. "I have always bowed to the will of God, even when it
was past understanding. I have always done my duty, and I have
never failed to govern my mind properly. When I tell the minister
this, he says that I must study the Book of Job and remember that
God is trying my faith."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage assented again, though more vaguely. After the
milder view of Divine Providence that was presented to the best
people every Sunday morning in St. Luke's Episcopal Church, she
had grown a little flabby in spiritual fibre, and she found
herself shrinking from the vehement doctrines of a less refined
but more formidable theology. Nevertheless, she told herself, it
was foolish to deny that the poor, and especially the afflicted
poor, needed a firm foundation, and that the hope of immortality
rather than the ease of the present contributed to a cheerful
outlook upon death. "Poor woman," she thought sadly, "who could
wish to destroy any beliefs that help her to bear her lot? How
can we even imagine all the secret miseries, like woven
tapestries, before her; all the endless pinching and poverty and
mortification of pride that composed Mrs. Burden's earthly
career. No woman could look so bleached, so petrified in spirit,
so ground down to powder in mind and heart, unless she had had
the pleasure of living wrung drop by drop out of her body and
soul. Pinching! Yes, this was the only word that expressed it.
Nothing but pinching day and night, for half a century and more,
could bring that drawn and sharpened edge to a woman's features.
Her daughter's ruin, Mrs. Littlepage reflected, with an aching
pity, must have been the last straw to her pride. Even with
wealth to soften it (and there was no use pretending that wealth
did not soften every affliction), disgrace was dreadful enough.
And without the alleviation of an ample income, which did not
bring happiness but made unhappiness far more comfortable,
Victoria decided that misery such as Mrs. Burden's was one of the
facts of life you simply could not look in the face. Was she in
want even now? Was she hungry? Did she need woollen garments or
sensible boots? In spite of Victoria's exalted mood, her
practical mind, which was securely tethered to philanthropy, was
already engaged in a tabulation of details. Food, clothes, fuel;
these things were necessary to the body, insisted her benevolent
purpose.</p>
<p>"We were getting along nicely until Milly's misfortune," Mrs.
Burden lamented. "After that I had to give up my place because I
couldn't keep up my spirits. I was matron for a church home for
old ladies, and the old ladies didn't want anybody about who
couldn't act cheerful and brisk."</p>
<p>"Have you ever thought of going back to some easy place? Mr.
Littlepage tells me that your daughter would be glad to leave
Queenborough."</p>
<p>"She talks about it. There is a good position she could have
in New York; but what would become of me in a big city? I don't
know even a church in New York."</p>
<p>"Has she thought of taking you with her?"</p>
<p>"Well, she says not. She thinks she could go away by herself;
but I don't see what in the world would become of her if she
didn't have me to advise her. Not that she ever troubles to take
anybody's advice. She is her father all over again. But good
advice, as my poor mother used to say, is beneficial even if
nobody takes it."</p>
<p>"I am sure it is," Mrs. Littlepage agreed, with a smile. It
was natural, though unfortunate, she supposed, that the poor soul
should be so despondent. Not that she approved of levity in the
poor. But such untempered melancholy as Mrs. Burden's was surely
more Russian than American in character. "Only I was wondering if
it would not be possible to find some congenial occupation for
you in Queenborough?"</p>
<p>"But what in the world would become of Milly if she didn't
have me to look after her? Why, I often lie awake in the night
worrying myself about who would take care of her if I were to
die."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage sighed and thought of Mary Victoria. "Such
devotion is not usual in this modern age, Mrs. Burden."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not pretending that she's grateful for it. But you
can't neglect your duty just because you don't receive the proper
return."</p>
<p>"You are right, of course, and your attitude is commendable."
As she rose from her chair, Victoria thought vaguely, "It is
weakness, no doubt, but I do find worldly people so much less
depressing." Almost deprecatingly, she added, "Then, I fear, it
is no use offering you a position as matron in our House of Hope?
Or perhaps you would like me to consult your daughter about
it?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Burden shook her head. "She doesn't realize how much she
needs me. But I couldn't reconcile it with my conscience to let
her go to New York alone."</p>
<p>"So many girls do that now," Mrs. Littlepage urged gently, and
checked herself before she added, "even good girls."</p>
<p>"That's what she says. But I tell her she isn't like other
girls. She has her mistakes to live down, and that makes her more
defenceless."</p>
<p>"I wonder," Mrs. Littlepage sighed. "I wonder," and indeed she
did. Though standards were not all that they used to be, she had
observed that a guilty youth is almost as great a disadvantage in
a business career as a virtuous middle age. "Do you think I might
speak to your daughter?" she asked suddenly, embarking upon an
impulse that astonished her only a little less than it displeased
Mrs. Burden.</p>
<p>"Well, there she is now." Mrs. Burden raised her voice to a
squeaking tone that was very painful to a sensitive ear.</p>
<p>The front door opened, and rapid footsteps approached.
Suddenly a light flashed out into the dusk; the wind from the
porch rustled and sighed in the hall; and a few brown and
withered leaves drifted over the threshold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c210" id="c210">X</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Poor Mother, are you still harping on the grave?" asked a
defiant voice from the hall. There was the worldly sound of
Marmaduke's laugh; and an instant afterwards, Milly came into the
room with a pile of kindling wood in her arms. As she stepped
over the threshold, the shadows parted and flowed away into
darkness; and when she tossed a handful of sticks on the fire a
sudden wavering glow transfigured the depressing interior. "How
vital she is," thought Mrs. Littlepage, while she held out her
large, soft hand with a motherly gesture, "but she looks older
and harder than she did before Mary Victoria's marriage." Seeing
the girl like this, she could understand the spell that had been
cast over Virginius. Not so beautiful, not nearly so perfect in
feature as Mary Victoria, but more human and certainly far more
exciting. The kind of woman, Mrs. Littlepage meditated, not
without sympathy, who has power over men; the kind of woman whose
every act, every gesture is instinct with vitality; the kind of
woman who, whether she was innocent or guilty, used to be called
dangerous.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Littlepage has offered me a place, Milly," Mrs. Burden
explained, with an accent of proper pride, "but I was just
telling her I didn't see how you would be able to get on without
me."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry, Mother. I can manage." What a voice the girl
had! How charged it was, beneath its gay derision, with youth and
magic and a breathless longing for flight! No really good woman
could look so alive, Mrs. Littlepage decided regretfully. Whether
Milly's bloom was natural, as it appeared, or artificial, as
Victoria suspected from the fashion of the age, it served
definitely to place her in a class with those other women who are
not all that they should be. And, apart from her rich colour and
her springtime glance, she was disposed of, for philanthropic
purposes, by the striking character of her dress. That red
cardigan, for example, the exact shade of--Victoria cast about
helplessly in her mind--a carnal appeal! Though Mrs. Littlepage
had never approved of severe measures with sin, she had always
preferred the mildewed aspect of poor Aunt Agatha to the
meretricious glamour of Mrs. Dalrymple's appearance. To resemble
a ruin rather than a monument was surely more in keeping with a
true sense of remorse. "Only hussies fall lightly enough to land
on their feet," her dear old grandfather, who prided himself upon
a robust vocabulary, had been fond of observing; and though she
was perfectly aware that a single fatal misstep may make a
Magdalen, it required, she told herself, both a slip and a
recovery to create a hussy.</p>
<p>"Are there any of us," she inquired sweetly and softly, "who
do not need a mother's love and a mother's prayers?"</p>
<p>"What sort of home do you mean?" was Milly's disconcerting
response. A stick of resinous pine had fallen from the fire; and
bending lightly, with a grace that would have tempted the nimble
male, she flung the wood back on the flames.</p>
<p>"We are looking for an assistant matron, really more of an
adopted mother, for our House of Hope," Victoria replied in the
bright and helpful tone of her Wednesday talks to drooping
daughters of joy.</p>
<p>"I think that it would suit her. Why won't she accept it?"</p>
<p>"She feels that you would not be able to manage without her.
But if you are really going away--" Dropping her sincere and
earnest gaze before the mocking eyes of the girl, Victoria turned
with a mute appeal to the older woman.</p>
<p>"I couldn't think of letting her go to New York without me,"
Mrs. Burden moaned.</p>
<p>"But I can get on perfectly well, mother. I could take a
little apartment by myself, and I'd be free for a few months. I'd
be free," she breathed suddenly, in a voice that was tremulous
with passion, with longing, with some indefinable joy of
escape.</p>
<p>"Are any of us really free?" Mrs. Littlepage asked, with the
patient wisdom of platitude.</p>
<p>"For a little while," Milly answered in that quivering tone.
"All I ask is to be alone--to be free--for a little while, just a
few months. As soon as I make a place there, Mother could join
me."</p>
<p>In a normal girl Mrs. Littlepage reflected, Milly's wish would
have appeared far from extravagant; but what the poor child had
happily forgotten was the tragic circumstances of her ruinous
past. Since her innocence, being already lost, was no longer in
peril, was she sufficiently prepared, through forbidden knowledge
alone, to defend what remained of her character? "She doesn't,"
Victoria mused sadly, "realize what it means to a woman to have
forfeited the respect of men."</p>
<p>Bending over her knitting-needles, which she picked up for
protection, Mrs. Burden whimpered under her breath, "You'll be
sorry when I'm dead, Milly."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry now, Mother. I've always been sorry. But I do want
to be free."</p>
<p>"Perhaps when you say 'free' what you really mean is
'rested,'" Mrs. Littlepage prompted, with tactful inspiration.
"Perhaps you've been kept too close in the office."</p>
<p>"No, I don't mean rested. I mean free. I mean free to go and
come when I choose. I mean free not to be asked where I'm going,
or where I've been, or why I went, or what I did there."</p>
<p>"That, my child, is nothing more than nerves," Mrs. Littlepage
replied more patiently than ever, because she perceived that
there was infinite need of patience. After all, it did really
look as if Milly needed her mother. Any young woman, with or
without a past, who talked so wildly was in evident need of both
mother and husband. "I am sure," she added inaccurately, "that
you will find your mother ready to help you."</p>
<p>"If she had followed my advice, she would never have got into
this state of mind," Mrs. Burden lamented, with bitterness. "I
didn't know what nerves meant when I was her age, and I'm sure
nobody ever had a meaner life, though I've always kept
respectable."</p>
<p>"Certainly, that is very much to be commended," Mrs.
Littlepage remarked in her charming social manner, which had
never failed her in the hour of necessity. "You are a mother, I
am sure, of whom any girl might be proud. Suppose," she concluded
still brightly, "that you agree to think over the matter and let
me have your decision. Remember, if I can help you in any way,
either by advice or in a more practical form, I shall be only too
happy to do it."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, after all, Mother will take that place for a few
months," Milly was urging. "Just until I am settled--"</p>
<p>"You couldn't get settled without me, Milly. You haven't any
idea how helpless you are about taking care of yourself or how
dependent you are on me. I couldn't sleep at night for thinking
of you in New York alone, with nobody to stand between you and
temptation."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage held out her hand. Really it looked, she
sighed, as if there could be no solution. Though she yielded to
no one, as she often said, in respect for the maternal instinct,
she could not dismiss the thought that moderation, even in a
divinely implanted attribute, is an excellent quality. With
patient kindness, she shook hands; with patient kindness, she
murmured "goodnight"; and with patient kindness, she left the
room and walked slowly out of the house into the roving wind,
which blew from a mottled sky and smelled of dead leaves. She
felt very tired, weak, and tremulous. The visit had taxed her
physical strength, and yet she had failed in her effort to clear
the way for Mary Victoria. She had failed, and she was shaken
from her inward serenity.</p>
<p>As she reached the gate, the door of the house behind her
opened and shut again, and she heard the startled whisper of
Milly's voice. "Mrs. Littlepage, will you wait? May I speak to
you?"</p>
<p>Turning hurriedly, she saw the red flash of Milly's cardigan
and her pale forehead beneath dark wings of hair which melted
into the twilight. Indoors, by the fireside, Victoria had been
moved by the girl's sparkling vitality, but out here, in this
ruined garden, surrounded by the blue dusk and the restless
murmur of leaves in the grass, Milly's charm was subdued to an
impersonal agency. It was as if she had ceased to be merely a
wronged woman, and had deepened into a tragic experience, a
vehicle of inarticulate passion.</p>
<p>"Why, certainly." After all, what other word could convey at
once so much and so little?</p>
<p>"Won't you please, oh, please, keep that place free a few days
longer? Perhaps I can persuade mother, if only you will give me a
little more time. It would make everything," the words rushed out
with a desperate eagerness, "so much easier."</p>
<p>"I can understand that, but she doesn't look as if she could
be persuaded. After all," this was uttered less firmly, "wouldn't
you feel safer if your mother was with you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't want to feel safe. I want to feel free."</p>
<p>"That is a wrong feeling, my child." The familiar refrain, for
she had had much experience with girls who felt the wrong way,
acted as a divine rubric upon the disordered processes of
Victoria's mind. "You should try to curb such impulses and to
govern your imagination. One danger of an unbridled imagination
is that it so often leads to a nervous collapse."</p>
<p>"That," Milly rejoined in an emphatic whisper, "is also the
danger of a bridled nature."</p>
<p>She was tremulous; she was unhappy; she had reached the
breaking point of her strength; and Mrs. Littlepage, who was
profoundly moved, was obliged to remind herself that these
emotions might have been, but apparently were not, the outward
signs of repentance. "You must cultivate a more hopeful view, my
dear child," she urged, while her sympathetic heart overflowed
and very nearly demolished the narrow boundaries of her settled
opinions. "You must not allow yourself to brood over the
past."</p>
<p>"It isn't the past; it is the present," the girl answered in
her thrilling voice. "I want my life. I have a right to my own
life."</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage, as a devout believer in the Episcopal
Prayer-Book, could not go so far as Mrs. Burden in embracing the
doctrine that we are all miserable worms in the sight of God.
Still, though she had her doubts about the dogma of original sin,
she had been brought up by indulgent but pious parents to regard
life, as she regarded the chivalry to be expected from a Southern
gentleman, more as a privilege than as a right. "I fear you have
a mistaken point of view," she said, with gentle authority. "So
many young people of to-day have lost sight of the fact that
duty, not pleasure, is the chief aim of living. I always tell my
girls," she continued on a higher note, "that, if we think enough
of our duty, our happiness will take care of itself." If only she
could instill this sacred precept into Milly's agitated bosom!
But could any voice, however imperative, quiet, even for an hour,
the tumultuous conflict in Milly's heart? "How different she is
from other injured women," Victoria said to herself, with a fresh
impulse of pity. Suddenly, without warning, an unsolicited heresy
darted into her mind, and she found herself thinking, with a kind
of weary astonishment, "I wonder why poor Aunt Agatha, or any
other woman, ever consented to become a superstition?" A
superstition! Was she actually going deranged? Or was there a
grain of truth in the evil imagination that ruined women, like
ghosts and goblins and warlocks and witches, vanished into the
dark ages of faith as soon as the world ceased to believe in
them? It seemed incredible and preposterous things were true
nevertheless.</p>
<p>"I am not asking much," Milly was insisting in that tone of
strangled emotion. "Only a few months or a year by myself. After
being by myself, I could bear mother-love so much better."</p>
<p>Bear mother-love! What an idea! What an expression! Surely
civilization was in imminent danger if the noblest sentiment of
the race, and not only of the race, but of all sacred and profane
literature, had become a burden instead of a blessing to the
young.</p>
<p>"I'll see what I can do, my dear child," she answered, with a
manner of gentle rebuke. Then, before turning away, she lingered
there on the broken flagstones, between the house and the gate,
and asked her perplexed mind how a girl with an unfortunate past
could have kept so gallant a look. The dusk was already closing
in; but a transparent lustre still mantled the west; and by the
wan light that fell from the sky, she could distinguish the
glimmering radiance of Milly's smile. In a flash, she remembered
that Virginius had always insisted upon calling Milly "a good
woman." Though Mrs. Littlepage was by no means prepared to follow
masculine opinion in such matters (and had observed, indeed, how
often trouble came of encouraging men in that branch of
philanthropy), she could not resist the indulgent thought, "After
all, I cannot find it in my heart to condemn her." In the winter
dusk it seemed to her that passion enveloped, though it failed to
ruffle, her passionless nature. She felt that she was being
slowly suffocated by the despairing effort, the mute anguish, the
deep vibration, of a thwarted desire.</p>
<p>"You must not lose courage," she said as cheerfully as she
could while she thought anxiously: "How would it be possible to
provide for Mrs. Burden without allowing her to have a doleful
effect on our girls? Of course, I could arrange to pay her salary
myself, and one would think that the gloomiest influence might be
safely assigned to look after the laundry." Aloud, she added in a
motherly tone, "My husband and I shall always be interested in
your future."</p>
<p>"He has been an angel to me!" Milly exclaimed, with fervent
gratitude.</p>
<p>Beneath the roving touch of the wind, a flush burned
Victoria's cheek. Sincerely as she respected gratitude, and
deplored the lack of that sentiment in modern youth, she could
but feel that ardour like this was excessive. Her confidence in
Virginius was unshaken; but she remembered that even the best
husbands, who have no lower side to their natures, are seldom
without their innocent vanities.</p>
<p>"Have you made your preparations to leave?" she inquired
abruptly.</p>
<p>"Not until I can settle about mother. That is all I am waiting
for."</p>
<p>"Do you think you will be happy in New York?"</p>
<p>"Happy?" The word was so long in ending that it seemed to
stretch and break beneath its burden of pain, of longing, of hope
deferred, of mocking derision.</p>
<p>"I can never forgive him," Mrs. Littlepage said to herself;
and without warning, the thought stabbed through her mind, "I
wonder if she has seen him since his return?"</p>
<p>For an instant the horror of the idea left her speechless.
Then an impulse stronger than pity, stronger than anger, stronger
than righteous resentment, surged up from the deep below the
deeps of her being. Loyalty to her own, the oldest and most vital
of her instincts, rose in the ascendant.</p>
<p>"The evenings must seem very long to your mother," she said in
a voice that grew more reserved with each syllable.</p>
<p>Milly flung out her arm with a gesture of weary impatience.
"Oh, the evenings are always long when you are waiting for
nothing!"</p>
<p>"I begin to feel that the sooner you go, the better it will
be," Mrs. Littlepage said sadly. "Even if your mother does not
make a suitable matron for our home (on this point she felt very
dubious), I can promise you that my husband and I will look after
her. It may be better to arrange for someone to live with her
here and attend to the lodgers."</p>
<p>Then, choking back her sympathy in the cause of her maternal
feeling, she dropped Milly's hand from her gentle pressure, and
turning away, walked slowly over the sunken flagstones and out
into the street. Well, that visit was at last over! Painful,
indeed, she had found it; for she felt that the struggle with
Mrs. Burden had exhausted all the resources of her patience and
her diplomacy.</p>
<p>Yes, she was very tired. Her limbs ached; her feet dragged;
there was a flutter in her pulse that reminded her of the
irregular ticking of a clock that is about to run down. "I must
go straight to bed," she thought. "The doctor warned me against
over-exertion. To-morrow I must begin to rest later, and I must
refuse to see anyone but Louisa." Even in the quivering state of
her nerves the image of Louisa brooded serenely above her stormy
horizon. "If I find that I am too tired to settle this matter; if
I am unable to help this girl without harming Mary Victoria,
Louisa will take the problem out of my hands." Yes, it was an
inexpressible comfort to remember that Louisa was always waiting
and ready to help her.</p>
<p>What a dismal street it was in the twilight! Dark, insecurely
paved with bricks, and swept by an untidy wind that scattered
dust and leaves in her face. A chill penetrated her heart, and
she thought, "Why did I come? How will it end? What is the
meaning of so much unhappiness?"</p>
<p>It was at this moment, as she approached the corner, with a
shuddering fear in her mind, that a man emerged from the thick
obscurity into her range of vision, and she recognized Mary
Victoria's husband. Hurriedly, without seeing her, he plunged
again from the electric light into the shadows, walking, she
observed quickly, more with the haste of an uncertain lover than
with the leisurely step of a husband who knows what awaits
him.</p>
<p>"It can't be. It is; but it oughtn't to be," she sighed in a
panic of terror. "Oh, my poor child! Oh, my poor Mary
Victoria!"</p>
<p>There was no thought left now of divided emotion; there was no
thought left of any feeling except that vehement loyalty to her
own. Pain as forked as lightning struck into her heart. "I must
try to bear it," she thought in terror. "I must try to bear it no
matter what happens. But not for anything in the world would I go
through it again."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="p03" id="p03">PART III</a></h1>
<h1>FALSE SPRING</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c301" id="c301">I</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"It feels like spring," thought Mr. Littlepage; and turning
his head on the pillow, he looked through one of the open windows
into a world that was transfigured by the swift pulsations of
dawn. Beyond the glossy twigs of the maples, the sunrise widened
in circles over the cloudless blue of the sky. "It is only
January, but it feels like spring. It feels like what we used to
call a false spring when I was young."</p>
<p>Within the last few months he had argued two important cases
in Washington before the Supreme Court; and this morning, after
his second victory, it seemed to him that he was floating out
into life with the freedom of a tired swimmer taking his ease.
"One case more or less, whether it is won or lost, makes little
difference," he said to himself, with his gaze on the eddying
ripples of light. "I have, on the whole, made a success of my
career, I suppose."</p>
<p>Fragile, transparent, as softly iridescent as the rays from a
jewel, the sunrise was stealing over the distant chimneys, over
the quiet streets, over the dark network of branches, and over
the tranquil form in the twin bed beside him. "Yes, it is only a
false spring," he repeated, while the words enkindled the
trembling gleam, the buried star of desire, that flickered in the
profoundest depths of his being. "It is only a false spring, and
we shall have our snows before April." Closing his eyes again, he
thought, with a start of surprise over nothing, "Life! I wonder
why people don't manage to get more out of life!" Coming and
going, getting and spending! These endeavours were all well
enough in their way; but were they sufficient for happiness? In
the other twin bed Victoria moved in her sleep and turned her
smooth ashen-brown head on the pillow.</p>
<p>He had awakened with a sense of eager expectancy. What was the
meaning of it? Had he been dreaming? Had anything happened last
night? No, he remembered that he had gone to bed feeling rather
more tired than usual, vaguely depressed, as if the best part of
his life were already behind him; and now, after a quiet night
(though he was aware that Victoria had been restless), he had
opened his eyes on a world that was glistening with promise. "I
must have been dreaming," he said aloud; and remembered that
years ago as a boy he used to awake with the feeling that he was
about to begin again some delightful adventure which he had left
unfinished in sleep.</p>
<p>"There must have been something else," he thought urgently.
"There must have been something more than I remember." While he
searched his reluctant mind the face of Mrs. Dalrymple was woven
airily from the brightness of dawn. Quickly he closed his eyes;
but when he opened them again she was still there, as if the
effort to banish her had merely deepened her lustre. For days,
for weeks even, he had seen her like this. In vain he had
obliterated her image; in vain he had tried to subdue his riotous
senses to the sober dictates of reason; in vain he had reminded
himself that ladies of too liberal virtue are more alluring than
safe, and that, in the pursuit of pleasure, as in the purchase of
securities, the prudent Southern gentleman has always preferred
safety to hazard. None of these arguments, however, had moderated
the demands of that eccentric appetite which persists in
thirsting for the unattainable and devouring what is bad for it.
Only last evening, for example, he had intended to avoid Mrs.
Dalrymple when he saw her on the other side of the street. He had
intended to avoid her; he had even started to do so, when
destiny, moving in the strangest manner through his lagging
footsteps, had swept him, out of the easiest way, in her
direction. And as soon as he had passed within the sunny area of
her charm, of her ardent vitality, as soon as he had met the
sparkling challenge of her smile, he knew that, for the hour at
least, if not for all eternity, he was lost. Was it credible, he
asked himself now, that in his carefully entrenched middle age he
should be visited by one of those flaming passions that he had
watched pursue, and sometimes overtake, other men? Useless to
pretend that he could curb either his roving fancy or his
rambling footsteps! Useless to deny that he was hesitating, more
or less precariously, upon the brink of a dangerous situation!
Several times within the last month, Mrs. Dalrymple had dropped
into his office, with what he could only recognize as the
fabricated excuse of consulting his legal opinion. More
frequently still he had passed her gate, and had naturally
stopped to exchange a comment upon the weather and other
impersonal topics. Yesterday, indeed, instead of leaving her as
soon as courtesy permitted, he had accompanied her into the house
and had glanced, in a dimly lighted room, over a few harmless
documents. Nothing had happened. Absolutely nothing. Nothing that
is, his accurate mind amended, more imprudent than his careless
remark, "You have made no changes in this room," and her
plaintive sigh, "Ah, then you have not forgotten!" What an
extraordinary woman she was, in spite, or because of, her
romantic misfortunes! All that sparkling vivacity, all that
fragrant softness, which some man had betrayed and some other
man, no doubt, had enjoyed. A little over-blown, perhaps
("luscious," Marmaduke had called her); but far more satisfying
to a discriminating taste than the closed buds of immaturity. In
that dusk firelight it had seemed to him that her loveliness was
suffused with the immortal glamour of legend. She had become a
part of a more effervescent world, of a more vital experience;
and it was this increased joy of life that he was longing to
share. He was longing to share it, though he knew that longings
are bestowed upon man not that he may gratify, but that he may
resist them, and by resistance set an example of merit. And now,
without resisting, without even evading, which was easier in
practice, if less sound in theory, he drifted hazily into the
wonder why light women are more tempting than their sisters of
substantial morality? Not all of them, to be sure. There were,
there must be, exceptions. But thinking only of charm, of that
mysterious yet potent quality which disturbs the heart through
the senses, it did appear that women who had forgotten themselves
were the ones that men were long in remembering. Sterling
attributes were, of course, desirable in the home. It would never
have occurred to him to associate Mrs. Dalrymple either with the
breakfast table or the twin bed; but, for the purposes of romance
it seemed that the lighter the woman, the better chance she
possessed of adorning the unexclusive pages of history.</p>
<p>"Are you awake, Virginius?" inquired the morning voice of
Victoria; and, as if in reply to her question, the door opened
and Maggie sidled in with the tray of early coffee. Ever since
Victoria's illness last winter, she had taken a cup of black
coffee before rising, and animated by the marital instinct for
imitation, Virginius had adopted this agreeable custom. At first
he had urged her to have breakfast in bed; but the older Southern
tradition had regarded breakfast in bed as the beginning of a
decline, and a cup of black coffee, without cream or sugar, was
the only indulgence Victoria permitted herself as a wife.</p>
<p>Large, soft, slightly rambling in figure, but discreetly
composed in expression, she sat up (while Maggie lowered the
windows) and poured the coffee into one of the thin green and
white cups. In her prim cambric nightgown, beneath the modest
lavender bed sacque, she had not lost the natural sweetness and
dignity of her demeanour.</p>
<p>"How pale, how tired, she looks this morning!" Virginius
thought, while he reached across the intervening space and
received the cup from her hand. Though she still wore a cheerful
look (nowhere, not even at a funeral, could she have reconciled
it with her duty to look cross or unpleasant), there were violet
circles under her eyes and a fine network of wrinkles around her
mouth. Seldom had she appeared less desirable; yet her good and
gentle expression was still attractive and he told himself that
she could never entirely lose the air of innocence with which he
had first fallen in love. Inexplicable as it seemed, his lawless
desire for Mrs. Dalrymple had increased his tender solicitude for
Victoria. Never had he been more considerate of her in fancy than
in those sanguine moments when he almost persuaded himself that
he could be unfaithful to her in fact. In contradiction to all
moral precept and most recorded examples, the mere prospect of
infidelity had made him not only a happier, but a more unselfish
husband. What he needed, he perceived at last, was not more of
marriage, but some ardent, though of course supplementary,
interest in life.</p>
<p>"It is a comfort to me, Virginius," Victoria said, while she
sipped her coffee, "to think that at last we have been able to
help Milly Burden."</p>
<p>This magnanimity, so characteristic of her, brought a rush of
tenderness to his heart. At the instant, he profoundly admired
Victoria. He longed to tell her that he admired her, that he
loved her; but no, this, he knew, was impossible. He had been
married now for almost thirty-two years, and every husband would
understand that it was impossible to say things like that in
marriage. So he responded simply, "Aren't you always helping
somebody, my dear?"</p>
<p>"But this is a particular case."</p>
<p>"Isn't every case a particular one?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've seen her several times lately, and seeing people
does make a difference. Except with Mrs. Burden. It was seeing
Mrs. Burden that made me realize she wouldn't do at all for our
House of Hope."</p>
<p>"Naturally. But if you pay her rent and leave her where she
is, how are you going to find anybody to look after her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that is all arranged. Louisa arranged it. She knows
another very respectable woman who is almost as depressing, and
quite as lonely as Mrs. Burden. Together they ought to be able to
keep each other company in the evenings."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage smiled at the pathetic picture. "You'll find
them fighting like cat and dog before the end of the week," he
said, "and Marmaduke interposing. However, it's all one to me so
long as Milly escapes."</p>
<p>For a few moments Victoria pondered the idea. Then she said
thoughtfully, "I have the queerest kind of feeling that we are
responsible."</p>
<p>Yes, he might have known, he assured himself, with relief,
that it was always prudent to trust Victoria's feeling. "That is
exactly my own sentiment, my dear," he said warmly. "It is
gratifying to me to find that you share my sense of
obligation."</p>
<p>"Mary Victoria feels differently. She is convinced that she
kept Martin from taking his life. It is impossible even to argue
with her because she insists upon seeing an act of God in it
all."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage sighed resentfully. Nothing, he was ready to
acknowledge, could be more difficult to argue with than an act of
God, not even the faith that persisted in magnifying every
occurrence into a miracle. It was one thing, he told himself, to
affirm a belief in the incredible from the family pew in church
on Sunday morning, and quite another matter to assent to fables
from one of the twin beds of modern marriage. "There are times,"
he remarked irritably, "when it seems to me that Mary Victoria's
head was completely turned by the war."</p>
<p>"I don't wonder that you are annoyed, Virginius. Nothing is
more annoying than an infatuation in somebody else. Perhaps when
the baby comes she will begin to be normal."</p>
<p>"I hope so. If she doesn't, and he continues to sow his wild
ideas, I think it would be well for them to move into a house of
their own. I'd buy them a house tomorrow, if it meant not having
to see him three times a day."</p>
<p>"Of course, while there's danger--and in spite of the way
doctors talk about safety in childbirth, women do still die of
it--but while there is any danger I feel that I should like to
have her with me."</p>
<p>"Naturally, my dear. I am sorry to find that her marriage is
turning out no better than we expected."</p>
<p>"I sometimes think," Victoria said wearily, for she always
felt worse in the morning, "that she doesn't know how to manage
him."</p>
<p>"Well, it isn't for lack of experience. Look at the way she
managed men in the Balkans."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it isn't the same thing."</p>
<p>"No doubt you are right. Relief work may be quite as arduous
as marriage, but I am inclined to agree with you that it requires
less diplomacy. I should say, from my casual observation, that he
is suffering from too much rather than too little managing."</p>
<p>"That is just what I mean, Virginius. You see Mary Victoria
tries to rule him by reason alone; and reason, however admirable
it may be, is the last thing men ever look for in women."</p>
<p>"Yet you, my dear, have always been guided by reason. It is,
indeed, one of your most endearing traits. What could, for
example, be more reasonable than your changed ideas about Milly
Burden?"</p>
<p>Inherently honest, yet desirous of pleasing, Victoria
hesitated before she opened her lips. Was her eagerness to place
Milly at a distance owing to solicitude for the unhappy girl or
to maternal anxiety about Mary Victoria? For weeks now she had
remembered that absorbed figure driven by a dangerous impulse
through the thick twilight, and with each recollection, she
assured herself that it was only natural for a mother to think
first of her own daughter. "After seeing their home I realized
what a struggle she must have had," she said slowly. "People of
that class are so harsh in their virtue. Her neighbours must have
made it very trying for her in the beginning."</p>
<p>"She never told me. She's that sort, you know. But the old
lady was with her, you see, and she must have been some kind of
protection. Few landlords would dare to attack such a fortress of
respectability."</p>
<p>"Respectable but so depressing. Just imagine how dreary it
must be to live in the house with her."</p>
<p>"Well, people have managed to live cheerfully in the house
with the doctrine of predestination. Some of us, you remember,
never recognise duty until it is scraped to the bone."</p>
<p>"You musn't call that duty." The words sounded so flat that
they might have been spoken by a ventriloquist, and he told
himself that Victoria had not put her mind on what she was
saying. "I like to consider duty a part of religion."</p>
<p>There were times, and this was one of them, when Mr.
Littlepage preferred not to consider duty at all; and so long as
he was not compelled to think about it, he was willing that
Victoria should decorate the idea in any fantastic art that she
admired. "Of course, you feel that way," he assented before he
touched on a subject in which he was naturally more interested.
"I have come to the conclusion that we made a mistake when we let
Mary Victoria go to the Balkans."</p>
<p>"How could we have stopped her, Virginius? Mary Victoria is
very determined."</p>
<p>He sighed. "I fear she is. And, after all, if it hadn't been
Europe, it would have been Africa."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was obliged to be some other country. She has that
kind of idealism. I don't mean that she doesn't love America
best; but, with all the other women working to improve things at
home, she felt that there wasn't room for her energies.
Motherhood will change all that, I am sure."</p>
<p>"And I suppose all this energy, which was too big to be
exercised at home, will be devoted now to the reform of one poor
devil. There are times, I confess, when I pity almost as heartily
as I despise him."</p>
<p>"I don't like that tone, Virginius, though the idea has often
crossed my mind that Mary Victoria never knows when to stop. Of
late, it has been something of a relief to look at Curle."</p>
<p>"Yes, Curle will never get us into trouble, though he may make
the world a desert and call it progress. But we must remember
they are both good children, and so, for that matter, is Duncan.
If he were not my son, I am inclined to think that Duncan would
be my favourite of the three."</p>
<p>"I think that so often, Virginius, and I tell myself that we
have much to be thankful for. Suppose we had had a daughter like
Milly Burden!"</p>
<p>His thoughts melted into a reverie, from which there was spun
an airy vision of light and darkness, of tears and laughter.
Daughters like Milly Burden were not plentiful, he imagined, and
seldom, if ever, were to be found in well regulated families.
Then, in obedience to a disturbing recollection, he proffered
sadly, "But there was poor Aunt Agatha."</p>
<p>"Yes, there was poor Aunt Agatha," Victoria admitted. "But,
even though I never believed it, the family insisted that Aunt
Agatha was slightly deranged at the time of her fall."</p>
<p>For a moment he was silent, less from lack of an argument than
because there are ideas a Southern gentleman does not introduce
to his wife. Though it was impossible, he knew, for any man to
live in the present age and remain in a state of innocence
concerning the faults of biology, he still assumed that Victoria
was impervious to the bolder misdemeanours of science. To be
sure, Louisa, who had penetrated beneath the shallow surface of
sound opinions, had discovered, to her satisfaction, that more
than one indelicacy is required to make the most capricious of
manias. But that was Louisa; and Louisa had travelled far since
the artificial 'eighties, when spinsters, like husbands, had
preferred sweetness to light. With Virginius, however,
sophistication had never filtered through the interwoven fibres
of prejudice. Stronger than theory, stronger than impulse, some
ingrained moral principle asserted that an unbalanced mind was
the only excuse for poor Aunt Agatha's early indulgence, and that
prolonged remorse in a third-floor back bedroom was the only
suitable remedy. "Undoubtedly there has been a great change," he
conceded.</p>
<p>"But moral laws cannot change, Virginius," Victoria protested
in the urgent tone which could be trusted to check Louisa's
virgin dashes after an unbridled psychology.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. Yes, certainly not," he replied, with an absence
of earnest conviction. After all, was anything stable? How could
a scientific theory, how could a moral law, be more stable than
the perpetual flux from which it emerged and into which it
returned?" It's a queer idea to come to a man like myself, a
perfectly normal man," he thought anxiously, and reflected the
next instant that the normal mind alone made these ideas
abnormal.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose you're right. They can't change," he repeated,
without the faintest idea of what he was talking about. "Well,
it's time for me to get dressed. You look fagged, Victoria. Why
don't you have breakfast in bed?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm all right, dear. Just a minute longer before you go.
I didn't like to worry you while you had that important case on
your mind; but I have been very much disturbed in the last month
about Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"Is that so? I was under the impression that she had
everything her own way as usual."</p>
<p>"You have been too busy to notice. I waited, hoping that I
might be mistaken; but I feel almost sure that Martin is seeing
Milly again."</p>
<p>This startled him out of the genial egoism in which he had
awakened. In the act of stepping into his slippers, he paused and
turned his benign but astonished face on his wife. "What makes
you think so?"</p>
<p>"Well, most of all from his manner. Men may vary in courtship,
though I doubt it, but they appear to have only one manner for
infidelity. Then, too, I never told you that I met him, though he
did not recognise me, that evening when I was coming away from
Juniper Hill. He looked unhappy--at least his walk looked so. It
was too dark for me to see his expression."</p>
<p>"Are you sure he was going to Milly?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not sure. How could I be? But where else could he
have been rushing at that hour on Juniper Hill?"</p>
<p>"I wonder," Mr. Littlepage mused aloud, while he thrust one
plump white foot into his slipper, "if he can be seeing Milly
again?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there isn't any doubt of it. He is the kind of man
who wouldn't hesitate if he wanted to see her. Only to look at
him, you can tell," she pressed in this point as if it were a
needle, "that he has no sense of moral responsibility."</p>
<p>"He has certainly shown no signs of one. But he might feel,
you know, that she is not without a claim upon him."</p>
<p>"How could he, Virginius, when he is married to Mary
Victoria?"</p>
<p>"I am not disputing the superior claim of his marriage, my
dear. I am merely reminding you that the seduction of a woman
does constitute some sort of moral claim on a decent man. When
there has been a child, the claim would appear to become
stronger."</p>
<p>"Why, I thought you argued just the other way a few days ago
about your Uncle Mark?"</p>
<p>Startled, but undefeated, Mr. Littlepage frowned at his image
in the mirror. "But that," he explained, with legal punctilio,
"was the case of a mulatto child."</p>
<p>Victoria blushed as she remembered. Yes, she supposed the fact
of colour did make a difference in the moral, as well as the
legal, angle of vision. For Uncle Mark's elaborate profligacy had
belonged to the immense area of knowledge that the mind of the
Southern lady embraced without being aware of. "Of course I feel
just as you do, Virginius," she said presently, for she preferred
to evade rather than examine the intricate logic of right
thinking.</p>
<p>"Well, it is a bad business at best," her husband conceded, as
he wheeled suddenly away from her, in his flowered bath-robe,
with the innocent air of an elderly cherub.</p>
<p>"His seeing her again," Victoria sighed, "will make a
distressing complication. Poor Mary Victoria! I wish I knew what
was best for her."</p>
<p>"Knowing what is best wouldn't help her, unless you could
persuade her to change her nature."</p>
<p>"And of course she couldn't do that. Like all young persons of
to-day, she thinks she possesses the only infallible wisdom."</p>
<p>"That, my dear, is an undistinguished delusion, and confined
to no particular era of history. Weren't we perfectly sure in the
'nineties that we could hasten the millennium by a study of the
obscurer Victorian poets?" He was on his way to his
dressing-room, but before he vanished as a husband to
materialize, after an interval, as a pillar of society, he added
impressively, "We must not forget that Milly Burden deserves
every consideration. Though she has made mistakes, she is at
heart a good woman."</p>
<p>Victoria, who had not a vestige of acrimony in her nature,
assented after her fashion. "I don't doubt that she has her good
qualities," she said gently, while she sank back on her pillows
and turned her faltering glance to the bare boughs and the palely
luminous sky. "After all, why should I care?" she asked herself
suddenly, with a twinge of asperity. "None of these things really
matter. Nothing of all this concerns me." For the last month,
ever since her visit to Juniper Hill, she had felt that she was
sinking into a windy hollow of space, and that about her there
was only this soundless tumult. It was as if she moved through
the world and played her part in a state of suspended animation.
"I am not real, I am hollow within," she repeated, after
Virginius had left her. "None of them has ever suspected it, but
I am as hollow as a drum beneath the mask I wear." Again that
shiver of exasperation ran through her nerves, and she added in a
whisper, "If only the noise would stop. If only I could break
through the confusion, there must be something beyond."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c302" id="c302">II</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>When Mr. Littlepage came down to breakfast he found his wife
presiding over the early Georgian coffee service, which always
reminded him of his mother. By the window Curle was briskly
unfolding the <i>Morning Post,</i> while poor Aunt Agatha, who
had acquired the habits of a contrite heart and slept little, was
sprinkling an excessive amount of sugar over her oatmeal. It was
one of the minor irritations of Mr. Littlepage's life that Aunt
Agatha could not be prevailed upon to curb her fondness for
sweets. Not only, as he had good and sufficient reason to know,
was sugar injurious to the Littlepage stock, which was
predisposed by heredity to various diseases; but he remembered
that his grandfather, who preferred his whisky straight, had
invented the maxim that every man digs his grave with his sweet
tooth.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to see," he remarked pleasantly, as he drew back
his chair, "that Aunt Agatha is so reckless in the matter of
sugar. No, Randall, no grape-fruit this morning."</p>
<p>Victoria shed a mild diffusive beam over the coffee-urn. "So
long as she doesn't grow fat or impair her digestion, why should
we interfere?"</p>
<p>"But she will suffer, she is obliged to suffer," Virginius
insisted. "Haven't I heard my dear old father say a hundred times
that too much sugar was injurious to everything by the name of
Littlepage?"</p>
<p>"She hasn't felt any bad effects yet, my dear."</p>
<p>"She will feel them in time."</p>
<p>"Well, why not give her time, father?" asked Curle, with his
buoyant air of "Don't knock, boost," or "Boost, don't knock" (to
save his life Mr. Littlepage could not remember which advice came
first.). "My private opinion is that, if grandfather had taken
more sugar and less whisky in his toddy, he might have weathered
the bad effects more easily. Are you afraid to try this
batter-bread and roe herring?"</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned over his egg and dry toast. Yes, Duncan
was right when he charged Curle with possessing every
qualification for political life, even an aptitude for hypocrisy.
As for the subject of their discussion, he regretted to see that
she was reaching slyly for the maple syrup, and having finished
her oatmeal, was preparing to invite dyspepsia with buckwheat
cakes. Strange that he should have lived in the house so many
years with poor Aunt Agatha without observing that she had a
disingenuous, he had almost said a stealthy, demeanour. Curle, on
the contrary, dispatched his unwholesome but appetizing breakfast
with the haste of a man who is on the point of flight or pursuit.
The instant after such criticisms had entered his mind, Mr.
Littlepage paused to ask himself if these were fair and impartial
opinions, or if, for some reason so obscure that he could not
fathom the source, he had left his genial morning mood in the
bath-tub? Certainly he had awakened in an agreeable frame of
mind. His impressions of the sunrise had been delightful and
luminous. Not a cloud had darkened his horizon, not a misgiving,
not so much as the shadow of a lean moral scruple. Then
gradually, without his being aware of the process, the
illumination had faded. Instead of that magnetic impulse toward
activity, he had felt merely an increasing sense of defeat. The
thickening medium of day; the interchange of ideas with Victoria;
even the necessity of putting on his clothes and resisting his
appetite at breakfast--all these tedious details, though harmless
enough in themselves, had settled in an accretion of gloom over
the surface of life.</p>
<p>"It would be wise for you to take a little more time with your
meals, my boy," he remarked directly to Curle; for having
observed Aunt Agatha's positive way with the maple syrup, he had
reminded himself that advice was always wasted on a woman,
especially on a woman who had received it so profusely.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't bother about dyspepsia," Curle replied in his
hurried tone, without waiting, his father noticed disapprovingly,
to chew his food before he gulped it down. "Whenever I feel a
pain, I swallow a pellet."</p>
<p>"That," Mr. Littlepage rejoined moodily, "is inviting
dyspepsia." And it crossed his mind, though he yielded to no one
in the sentiment of patriotism, that it was in keeping with the
American brand of courage to invite dyspepsia with a panacea in
one's pocket. "Where is Mary Victoria?" he inquired, averting his
glance from the rapid impairment of Curle's digestion.</p>
<p>"The child isn't well this morning," Victoria explained. "I
spoke to her on the way down and urged her to stay in bed.
Martin," she added in a cooling tone, "never gets up until the
last minute."</p>
<p>"I dare say he contracted that habit from literature; but it
is out of place in a business career."</p>
<p>"He complains that he is unable to sleep at night."</p>
<p>"Do you know when he came in?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Littlepage looked appealingly at Curle, who replied in
his breezy manner. "I let him in at one o'clock. He had forgotten
his key. His key or his change is always in the other
pocket."</p>
<p>"Did he tell you why he was so late?" asked Mr. Littlepage,
with a vaguely menacing air.</p>
<p>Curle laughed. "Yes, he explained that he had been out for a
walk. It appears that he prefers taking his walks at night. No
doubt he contracted that habit also from literature. Perhaps
even," he added, with jovial humour, "from French
literature."</p>
<p>It was unreasonable, Mr. Littlepage mused, to expect Curle to
admire Martin. It was unreasonable to expect any man with red
blood in his veins to admire a white-livered mooncalf, who wrote
unwholesome books that nobody bought, and had lived long enough
in Paris to lose the last shreds of American idealism. Curle,
whatever his faults of breeding, and they were serious, was an
American, every ounce of him. Moreover, in all the essentials of
the code (including his respect for women and his antipathy to
unwholesome books, and indeed to books of any character), he was
a Southern gentleman of the permanent school. Well, there was
comfort, however luke-warm, in the assurance that Curle would
never cause him an uneasy moment. His younger son, he had long
ago decided, was as safe as a Liberty Bond and almost as
uninteresting. As for those nocturnal wanderings of Martin, Mr.
Littlepage told himself that he was still conventional enough to
disapprove of any midnight strolling that took you away from your
wife.</p>
<p>"I wish he would come home earlier," Mrs. Littlepage murmured
anxiously. "It keeps Mary Victoria up so late, and she needs
sleep."</p>
<p>"But I thought we gave them that upstairs sitting-room because
he liked to stay up and she wanted to go to bed?"</p>
<p>"That didn't work very well. She says she can't go to sleep
until she knows he is in the house, and if she drops off and he
wakes her by turning on the light, she doesn't close her eyes
again. I suppose she got into bad habits, too, like everybody
else who went to Europe and didn't come home as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>"The trouble is," Duncan remarked, with his sardonic smile,
"that there isn't as much room for bad habits in this house as
there was in Europe. Some of them have to be broken."</p>
<p>"Well, you can scarcely expect Mary Victoria to begin as long
as she is not feeling well," Mrs. Littlepage urged gently. "If
there are sacrifices to be made at this time, surely Martin ought
to be willing to make them. Aren't you taking rather too much
coffee this morning, Virginius?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps, my dear. Has it occurred to you, by the way, that
Martin is the sort of husband who has never discovered that
sacrifices are expected in marriage?"</p>
<p>"Hush! They are coming. There will be some hot coffee in a
minute, Curle."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a fine morning," Mr. Littlepage observed
blandly.</p>
<p>"A very fine morning," his wife assented a little nervously.
"I hope you had a good night, Aunt Agatha?" Meeting poor Aunt
Agatha's sharpened glance, she thought irrelevantly, "I sometimes
think she might have had a mind if she had ever been allowed to
use one."</p>
<p>"A very good night, thank you," poor Aunt Agatha replied
politely; for this was the answer she had made every morning, in
sickness or in health, for almost half a century. Sitting there
in the winter sunlight, with her small, keen features, her bent
shoulders under a furry grey shawl, her animated brown eyes, and
her eager yet polite appetite for sweets, she reminded her nephew
of a fastidious squirrel intent upon shelling a nut. Though he
gazed at her thoughtfully, there was little wonder, if any, in
his mind; for she had reached the age when a woman, however
piquant her reputation, has ceased to be an object of wonder to
men. She had reached the age, indeed, he reflected, when all
experience for a woman has withered to the small hard kernel of
duty. So shadowy was the impression left by Aunt Agatha on her
surroundings that when Victoria had once remarked to her husband,
"Poor Aunt Agatha has had such an empty life!" he had replied,
with inattentive kindness. "Why, I thought we had made her very
comfortable. After all, women of her age must expect to make duty
their pleasure." What, indeed, he had proceeded to reason, could
be more in harmony with the ideal of pure womanhood than an
imperceptible fading, at the proper time of life, from the
ornamental into the useful, from the woman whom men admire into
the woman whom men esteem? And when Victoria had objected in her
mild but obstinate tone, "Esteem is good as far as it goes,
Virginius, but you can't fill your life with it," he had retorted
almost irritably, "Good women when they grow old have always done
so, Victoria."</p>
<p>"Did you have a good night, dear?" Victoria began again,
forgetting in her anxiety that she had spoken to her daughter
upstairs. Then, without waiting for a reply, she continued with
artificial brightness, "It is a very fine morning."</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't sleep, but it is a fine morning." Though Mary
Victoria's animation was flagging, she smiled as bravely as ever.
Would the time ever come, her father mused while he watched her,
when the brilliance of her smile would be tarnished by years? She
was looking a little drawn and sallow, he noticed, and when the
smile faded on her pure cold features, he was reminded of the
paling of the rich afterglow in a leaden sky. How much of her
conquering loveliness was owing to the merest accident of light
and colour? At this hour she appeared not only ill, but as soon
as she stopped smiling, unhappy. Was this touching expression the
result of some physical change, or was the fellow already making
her miserable? Certainly, no husband ought to wander alone at
midnight when his wife was for the first time, or even for the
last time, in Mary Victoria's condition. Even if Martin had not
gone to see Milly, he had committed the unpardonable affront of
roaming about the streets while his wife was waiting sleepless
for him in her father's house. While he meditated, Mr. Littlepage
felt the flame of righteous indignation mounting within him. It
was incredible to him that any man who had made a failure of his
life, and was without the dignity conferred by an accumulation of
property, should be able to make Mary Victoria unhappy.
Well-favoured, no doubt! Victoria, who was superior to the
magnetism of sex, had declared that Martin was well-favoured
enough, with his slender height, his flat brown hair, and his
brilliant eyes, to turn the head of a girl who had resisted the
fiery glances of Balkan blades.</p>
<p>With these roving thoughts in his mind, he watched the anxious
flicker in Victoria's look, and heard her ask her daughter with
grave reproach, "Isn't Martin going down with your father,
dear?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he was ready before I was, but he stopped to put down a
phrase that came to him in the night. He is doing some short
stories of Americans in Paris."</p>
<p>"It is a pity you can't persuade him to keep better
hours."</p>
<p>"I never try to persuade men, mother dear. Think of all the
ages in which women depended upon persuasion, and what did they
get out of it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." Mrs. Littlepage stirred wearily in her chair,
for it seemed to her that she had been sitting on edge since the
dawn of creation. "I should think that they got a good deal out
of it if they wanted."</p>
<p>"That is the very reason I refuse to do it, mother," Mary
Victoria rejoined plaintively. "The old feminine way was
insincere and indirect. I determined that our marriage should be
founded upon perfect candour."</p>
<p>"Well, I am not going down in the car," Mr. Littlepage said,
as he rose from the table. "I would rather walk on a fine
morning." Ever since Mary Victoria's return, he had breathed the
inclement air of perfect candour, and he told himself that to-day
he preferred not to drive down the street in its company. There
was much to be said, he felt at this particular moment, in favour
of the imperfect feminine deceit of the past. Whatever its
failings, he had found it more restful at breakfast, and less
inclined to retard the natural processes of digestion. Though he
was prepared, however reluctantly, to take his daughter's side
against Milly Burden, he decided, while he acknowledged Martin's
inattentive "good-morning," that moderation in a wife is second
only to chastity. For the first time in his enviable career, it
occurred to him that intemperate virtue is almost as disastrous
in marriage as temperate vice. Passion, he supposed, explained,
even if it failed to excuse, Martin's whole misadventure with
life; but passion could scarcely account for the harmful moral
activities of Mary Victoria.</p>
<p>"I hope your headache is quite gone," Mrs. Littlepage was
saying sympathetically to Martin.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is quite gone, thank you."</p>
<p>"Virginius likes to walk to his office, but I shall be glad to
drop you at the bank on my way to market."</p>
<p>"That's very kind of you, but I'd rather walk, too."</p>
<p>"I should have thought you'd had enough of that last night,"
Curle began in the aggressive tone he reserved for the
nonconformist mind in general. "You looked pretty well fagged out
when you came in at one o'clock."</p>
<p>"I get restless when I am writing, and I am obliged to walk it
off. Sometimes I used to roam the streets of Paris until
daybreak."</p>
<p>"Well, nobody roams in Queenborough. We have learned here that
a straight line is the shortest way between two ends. If you
don't look sharp, they'll think you demented."</p>
<p>An angry flash passed between the two young men, and then
Martin retorted irritably: "I sometimes think so myself."</p>
<p>Curle laughed unpleasantly. "As long as you are the only one
who suspects, it makes no difference. But be careful that you
don't let the rest of us catch on."</p>
<p>"If only Martin and Curle would try to find a point in
common!" Mary Victoria exclaimed. "Endless scrapping is so
futile."</p>
<p>"Yes, scrapping is futile," Mr. Littlepage assented, "and even
if we haven't a point in common, it is not impossible to invent
one. Not many of us are able, like Duncan, to exist comfortably
without points of contact." Silently he continued: "I wish I
didn't dislike the fellow so heartily. I wish, if only for
Victoria's sake, that I could put up with him." Was it Martin's
conduct alone, he inquired sternly of his conscience, that made
the young man so repugnant to the instincts of a gentleman? Many
men of good social standing, even in Queenborough, had saved
their reputations, he knew, in similar situations by deserting
their lighter loves from the highest, instead of the lowest,
motives. In the motive of desertion, as Victoria had so often
assured him, there was all the difference between reform and
dishonour. Any woman, she had explained with a firm and noble
accent, could perceive the fine distinction between abandoning a
woman without reason and forsaking a vice because you wished to
profit by an example of purity.</p>
<p>"Will two clever men ever consent to agree?" The words floated
to him in the bright, calm voice of his wife; and while he met
her kind and charming glance, he comforted himself with the
reflection that wherever she lived and moved and shed her
sweetness of nature, there would be harmony.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c303" id="c303">III</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>As Mr. Littlepage stepped briskly across the street, it seemed
to him that the variable moods of the morning had melted into a
state of cheerful expectancy. Rain had fallen last evening, and
the world sparkled as freshly as if it had been created at dawn.
Overhead, beyond motionless boughs, the blue sky appeared to be
dissolving in light, while pale clusters of shadows lay like a
false spring bloom on the grass in Mrs. Dalrymple's garden.</p>
<p>After all, it was a good old world, Mr. Littlepage thought
hopefully, slackening his pace as he recognized the sphinx-like
shape of the Persian cat on the doorstep. Everything about Mrs.
Dalrymple's house was disposed, with the lady herself, to appeal
to the softer masculine moods. Wide, low, luxurious in setting,
with its round white columns and its polished door beneath the
fanlight of amber glass, the dwelling presided hospitably over
its borders of miniature boxwood. Even the sleek Persian cat,
striped like a tiger, reminded Mr. Littlepage of the purring
grace of its mistress. Though the cat was too reserved in manner
to attract his gregarious nature, and he felt usually the
indifference of the Southern gentleman to any creature who could
not make light conversation, there was to-day a fascination for
him in the detached yet affable air with which the dignified
animal rose at his approach. In the last few weeks, the world in
which Mrs. Dalrymple lived, had become a sphere of more intense
and vivid reality. This was the world, he felt, that he had
always longed to inhabit. After seeing Amy Dalrymple, he would
forget for hours that he was middle-aged, and he would linger
over his work with the feeling that some beautiful and satisfying
experience awaited him. Then the warmth would die down; the
endless tedium of life would envelop his soul; and he would
recite all the proverbs that sanctify marriage and civilize the
vagabond ways of the heart. After all, this would pass. False
spring would be over. Desire, that hardy annual, must come to an
end; and this sense of having lost something infinitely precious
that he had never possessed would fade as inevitably as his
desire. But, on this genial winter morning, slackening his pace
before Mrs. Dalrymple's house, he felt, with a hurt and
bewildered astonishment, that he was struggling against forces he
could not understand. Why has it happened like this? Where am I
drifting? As a husband and a lawyer he had respected all the
institutions and practised all the rules that civilization
imposed. After a sober and well-spent youth, just as he was
settling into the evergreen monotony of the middle years, was he
becoming the victim of one of those fateful passions that destroy
husbands and make poets? In his office, with an engrossing legal
problem before him, he could command his attention; but as soon
as he passed out into the world, he was lost again in that
restless undercurrent beneath the shifting surface of life. He
had known Mrs. Dalrymple for many years; and after his first
brief infatuation, he had dismissed her from his mind as a light
and pretty woman whom a man might love for an hour and forget in
the morning. Yet he realized now that no other woman, with the
exception of Victoria in her youth, had moved him so long and so
deeply. The age of love had come and gone, and through it all he
had felt nothing stronger than pleasure or more lasting than
impulse. Life, he saw now, had marched by him while he had
lingered among shadows that he called the things of the mind. It
is true that he had been tranquil, that he had believed himself
to be satisfied. But now in a week, in a day, in an hour, an
ordinary, almost a commonplace woman, with nothing unusual about
her except her vitality, had changed the whole of existence.
Well-preserved, no doubt, but cast in a shallow mould and already
beginning to break. In a few more years, the living ardour, the
vital warmth, which quickened his senses to this false spring,
would die away, with that transfiguring glow, into ashes. When he
thought of her this morning he could remember nothing that she
had ever said, nothing that she had ever meant, beyond this
eloquent response, this extraordinary animation of soul. Yet so
intense had his hidden desire become in his life that it haunted
all the trivial actualities and made the rest of experience no
more real than phantoms.</p>
<p>Whenever he paused to moralize, which he did but seldom, it
seemed to him incredible that this adventure of the heart should
have happened to him and not to Marmaduke, who was so obviously
designed to be an enemy to society. It would even have appeared
ridiculous to him had there been any circumstances in which a man
could appear ridiculous to himself. Everything, people, objects,
occasions, all reminded him of Amy Dalrymple's smile. Frequently
in the street he was arrested by a resemblance to her in some
passing woman, in a walk, in a carriage of the head, in a
provocative gesture, in the gay and musical notes of a voice. He
had scoffed at youth for its rashness, its vehemence, its lack of
proper control, its selfish preoccupation with a solitary
emotion; and now, at fifty-seven, in the fugitive sunshine of
autumn, he had plunged into the kind of catastrophe that only the
young and inexperienced can call happiness. Like this false
spring in winter, like the blossoming plants and the hungry
mouths of nature, or like that grim reaper of his mother's
favourite poem, love appeared to demand all seasons for its own,
as well as its peculiar time to fade and fall. What if, in the
end, Louisa and contemporary literature should prove to be right,
and the ideal of chivalry should be preserved only as a
psychological fossil? Louisa, who had gone as far, he decided, as
it was safe to go without puncturing the balloon of civilization,
had reduced all the ancient perils of society to the white-slave
traffic and the predatory instincts of the male. Though this
point of view interested him as an argument, it was repugnant, he
felt, to every civilized sentiment. For, in common with other
men, he was cold to the white-slave traffic; and he clung
stubbornly to the belief that, since man is not responsible for
his own nature, he had probably suffered more than Louisa from
the harmful instincts of the male sex. Moderation, he sighed
pensively. Would good women, of whom his world contained so
generous a share, ever learn the value of moderation? Yet,
surely, even in its extremity, virtue commanded the respect of
every right-thinking mind. Moreover, if respect were a sentiment
that ruled the world, or even rocked the cradle, he knew that
Louisa, not Mrs. Dalrymple, should be the proper dispenser of his
delight. Compared to Louisa's gallant baying at shadows, he could
not deny that Mrs. Dalrymple's voice was as frivolous as the coo
of a turtle-dove. Only, like every other legitimate son of Adam,
he preferred a coo to a bay.</p>
<p>He was approaching the Vigilant Club (that stern-fronted
building had started this train of reflection), and just as he
reached the gate, the imposing door opened, and Louisa, bearing
her portfolio, tripped down the steps. Catching sight of him, she
called his name with her wonted enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Oh, Virginius, I am so glad of this opportunity! There is an
important matter I wish to consult you about."</p>
<p>Here, he reflected, while he grasped her hand, was one of the
most deserving women of his acquaintance. Here, indeed, was a
woman so superior that his regard for her was as unenterprising
as his respect for the Ten Commandments. Tall, slender, still
handsome for her age, and as erect as a moral principle, she
smiled at him with that mingling of good sense and good humour
which ought to have been, only it was not, as alluring as
coquetry. Beneath her smart black hat, her waving iron-grey hair
shone with a silver gloss; her eyes sparkled with pleasure
through her discreet glasses; her firm brown skin, in which even
the wrinkles went upward, looked not so much youthful in texture
as impervious to age. Everything about her was bright and
positive and earnest; and he observed, with an inward smile, that
her features wore an expression of faint surprise, as if the
mysteries of Babylon had left her in a state of perpetual
astonishment. For a reformer, he considered her unusually
good-looking. Her face was not, like Mrs. Burden's, an act of
God, but was still agreeable enough to tempt any man, if there
existed one who did not think that he was too young for her. For
some years now she had been the only thorn in his comforting
theory that bachelors make themselves while Providence makes
spinsters. In spite of her intelligence, Louisa had received, he
knew, at least half a dozen dubious proposals of marriage, as
well as several desirable offers of an established position and
an ample income. Even from the chivalrous angle, it was
impossible to think of her as discarded by life. First and last,
he admitted, she excelled as a good sport; and he was
sufficiently generous to admire a good sport even in the
inappropriate disguise of a spinster. It was true, as he promptly
amended, that her type was not the one he preferred. Her whole
appearance, fine, distinguished, and slightly inquisitive, was
not formed, like the rambler-rose of Mrs. Dalrymple's face and
temperament, to attract the despoiler. No, Louisa appeared, he
summed up hastily, exactly what she was in character, a woman of
independent spirit, who knew her world and was capable of finding
her way.</p>
<p>"I had planned to see you this morning, Virginius. For the
last few weeks, ever since that first visit to Mrs. Burden, I
have not been easy in my mind about Victoria."</p>
<p>"You mean--"</p>
<p>"I mean she has been over-exerting herself. This trouble about
Milly Burden has been a great strain on her. Victoria gives so
much sympathy. She never thinks of herself."</p>
<p>"It would be better sometimes if she did. I'm afraid we've got
into the habit of taking advantage of her unselfishness."</p>
<p>"She has always been so energetic; but ever since that attack
of pneumonia she has not seemed like herself. I wish you would
try to persuade her to be more saving of her strength."</p>
<p>"I'll try, of course, though she won't listen. There isn't
anybody in the world whose advice means so little to her as
mine," he added on a playful note.</p>
<p>"I am sure you are mistaken, Virginius." Sadness had stolen in
a brown mist over the sunny hazel of Louisa's eyes. "She thinks
you are the most wonderful man in the world."</p>
<p>"That, my dear friend, is her only weakness." His tone was
still light, for he was always a little embarrassed by Louisa's
clear but short views of life. Though she was not wanting in
humour, she seemed unable to apply its sharpened edge either to
persons whom she admired or to principles that she respected.
Standing beside her in the tempered sunlight, which glittered
over her like varnish, he studied her intelligent features a
moment before he continued. "But you are right. The time has come
when she should begin to think of herself."</p>
<p>"No one realizes that, Virginius, more than I do. Even as a
child," she added, with a quiver in her competent voice, "from
the first winter after her family came to Queenborough, I have
always adored her."</p>
<p>"Everyone has adored her." A flush darkened his smooth skin,
for, unlike Louisa, who blushed only at facts, he was more
sensitive to words than to deeds. "It may be because she exacts
so little. I sometimes think that she is the least exacting woman
on earth."</p>
<p>"It is a great happiness to hear you say that. No man ever had
a better wife, and I am sure that no woman ever had a truer
friend that Victoria has been to me."</p>
<p>"She is devoted to you. Yours has been a wonderful friendship,
and it has made me ask myself, now and then, if men really know
anything about women."</p>
<p>As she nodded over her portfolio, he thought irrelevantly of a
sparrow pecking a crumb. "Not about women in themselves, only
about women in relation to men." Then her tone lost its
authority, and she said in a whisper of agitation, "I'm afraid
this affair has been almost too much for her. It is not only the
tragic circumstances of Milly Burden. I think the greatest blow
has been the discovery that Martin is seeing the girl again."</p>
<p>"She didn't tell me until this morning."</p>
<p>"That was like her. She was afraid of distracting your mind
from those important cases. But I know that she has been very
much worried over it."</p>
<p>"I wish you had gone with her to Mrs. Burden's, Louisa."</p>
<p>"I didn't know of that first visit until after she came home.
Once or twice since then we have stopped at the house for a
minute; but we have never noticed any sign that Martin had been
there."</p>
<p>A look of distress sharpened his features, and it seemed to
her that his face was suddenly refined and ennobled. "Yes, I'm
afraid you're right. The whole thing has been too great a strain
on her."</p>
<p>"The strain and shock together. You know how she feels about
Mary Victoria, especially at this time, and she has got the idea
into her head that the child's happiness is threatened."</p>
<p>He frowned. "If it wasn't ruined before it began."</p>
<p>"You and I feel that way." Her complete sympathy enveloped
him.</p>
<p>"Even Victoria must understand that no marriage could endure
on such a--a rotten foundation."</p>
<p>"She does understand it. That is a part of her anxiety.
Mothers are made that way. They suffer again in the life of every
child."</p>
<p>"In a lecture you would call that an extension of the
ego."</p>
<p>"But this isn't a lecture. It is--"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what it is!" he had begun, in his whimsical vein,
and with scarcely a change of tone, he added after a pause, "And
I used to consider Mary Victoria a sensible girl."</p>
<p>"No girl is sensible when she is in love," Louisa replied; and
he asked himself, with a twinge of irritation, if she had merely
repeated one of Victoria's soundest platitudes? Why was it, he
inquired almost resentfully, that every thing he knew or thought
or examined, persons, opinions, objects, all issued from
Victoria, like rays diverging from some vital but passive centre
of experience? Nothing that she said was ever original; yet it
was always repeated as a proverb, with the accent of authority.
Though at middle age she herself was neither beautiful nor
interesting, she was, it appeared, as much admired as she had
ever been by the best minds. Was this because she was so sensible
in her views that she had become in time the voice of established
conviction? Or was it because when she spoke of herself as
"advanced" in her opinions, she meant always advanced in the
right direction? Ah, that was the word he needed, there was the
label! Since she was advanced enough to be modern and
conservative enough to be safe, she had become a power for good
in the community. All the forces of progress that still feared
the strange and the new had assembled behind her.</p>
<p>"Well, it looks as if Mary Victoria would have to come to her
senses," he said, with decision. "If the fellow is unfaithful to
her, the sooner she discovers it, the better it will be for
her."</p>
<p>"She might at least be spared," rejoined Louisa, whose
courage, unlike his, was equal, in conversation at least, to the
extremity of birth, "while she is expecting a child."</p>
<p>Her colour did not change while she watched the becoming flush
mantle Mr. Littlepage's suave features. If he had looked into her
straight and narrow mind, where every idea, old or new, was
neatly labelled and placed in its proper category, he would have
surprised merely a bright wonder that men should be so timid
about facing the facts of life. "That is what makes Victoria so
anxious," she explained fearlessly. "A shock at this time might
be so harmful."</p>
<p>"She is right of course. She is always right." Though the
words were as much as any paragon of wisdom could expect from a
man, there was a ruffled sound, the merest hint of annoyance, in
his agreeable voice.</p>
<p>"She never admits that Mary Victoria has a fault," Louisa
reminded him. "One of Victoria's most beautiful qualities is
loyalty. She can see no flaw in anyone that she loves."</p>
<p>This also, he admitted readily, was nothing more than the
truth. Praise, however superlative, never sounded effusive when
it was lavished upon a good woman. He had won a perfect wife, he
told himself once again, and the fault was in his spiritual part
if he longed for something more--or was it something less?--than
perfection.</p>
<p>Assuredly, he had everything that any husband has a right to
expect; and yet, as he had sufficient reason to know, any husband
is uncertain alloy rather than pure metal. There was, for
example, the attraction of mystery. For mystery, though frowned
upon by reformers, is still an indestructible element in the
desires of the heart.</p>
<p>"You and I," he said sincerely, "can find no flaw in
Victoria." Then, dropping his gravity as easily as if it were a
handkerchief, he added in the softer accents of chivalry, "You
ought to have married, Louisa. It is a great regret to me that
you could not make allowances for Marmaduke's temperament."</p>
<p>To his astonishment a vivid blush stained her cheek. What was
there, he wondered, in his harmless remark about marriage that
could embarrass a spinster who had confronted so unflinchingly
the naked fact of birth?</p>
<p>"We should never have suited each other, Virginius," she
answered in her gentlest voice. "As it is, I have been quite
happy. I do not feel that I have missed anything."</p>
<p>"You are too fine a woman not to have made some man a good
wife." How windy that sounded, how hollow. Yet it was the sort of
thing, he insisted defiantly to himself, that every unattached
woman expected from a married man a generation ago.</p>
<p>"I have been quite, quite satisfied," Louisa repeated, as if
she were determined to convince him of the truth. "You and
Victoria have meant more to me than I can ever make you believe.
Your children have been as dear to me as if they had been my
own."</p>
<p>Gratitude moistened his eyes as he looked at her. "You are a
noble woman," he answered, with feeling. "I cannot think what
Victoria and I should have done without you. From the beginning,
as she often reminds me, you have been a rock to lean on."</p>
<p>Again that girlish flush dyed her smooth brown skin. "I would
do anything in the world," she responded, "for Victoria and you
and the children. But you must not think that my life is not so
full as I wish it to be."</p>
<p>"Mustn't I?" He smiled playfully. "Well, you ought to have
been a man, Louisa."</p>
<p>Her dark eyebrows sprang up in amazement; but she retorted
good-humouredly, "And you ought to have been a woman,
Virginius."</p>
<p>He frowned. "Do you mean that I am too fussy?"</p>
<p>"Not in the least. Do you mean that I am too bold?" Then,
while he was searching his less nimble mind for an answer, she
continued with the moral earnestness which was, in his opinion,
her most pronounced feminine attribute, "Please try not to be
flippant. It is a very serious situation."</p>
<p>"Then you and Victoria must handle it. I am not at home in
serious situations."</p>
<p>"We have done all we could, and apparently it isn't enough.
The only thing now is for you to speak to Milly Burden."</p>
<p>"Speak to Milly? Why, I speak to her fifty times in a
day."</p>
<p>"But not about Mary Victoria's husband."</p>
<p>"No, thank God, there are other things to be said."</p>
<p>"But you will," she pleaded urgently, "speak to her now?"</p>
<p>His frown deepened. "I am willing to speak to her, but I
haven't the slightest idea what I could say."</p>
<p>"Well, you could warn her--couldn't you?--that she is pursuing
an unfair and dangerous course?"</p>
<p>Still frowning, he broke into an angry laugh. "Has it ever
occurred to you that she might retort, 'Dangerous for whom?'"</p>
<p>"It is impossible to appeal to her moral sense?"</p>
<p>"I have never tried; but there again she might reply that you
can't grasp a moral sense by both ends."</p>
<p>"I have never known you to be so sarcastic, Virginius."</p>
<p>"I am not sarcastic, I am merely honest. These different
accents have a way of sounding alike."</p>
<p>Louisa glanced swiftly away, and then back again at his look
of ruddy indignation, which was very becoming. "After all, he is
your daughter's husband, Virginius."</p>
<p>"That isn't my fault. Mary Victoria married him, I didn't. My
advice, even as a lawyer, was not consulted."</p>
<p>"But the fact that she is his wife means a great deal. Doesn't
the whole structure of society rest upon the institution of
marriage?"</p>
<p>"I used to think so; but that was before I discovered that it
rests much more firmly upon the institution of hypocrisy. Have
you never, in the last forty years, changed your opinions,
Louisa?"</p>
<p>She looked at him anxiously. "Oh, often, but never about moral
values. I regard marriage as reverently as I used to do. In spite
of the emancipation of women, I believe you have changed more
than I. The shock of Mary Victoria's marriage did a great deal to
upset you."</p>
<p>"More than anything that ever happened," he confessed, "more
than the war, more than poor Aunt Agatha's past. You see, I had
pinned my faith on Mary Victoria's goodness. I don't mean on her
virtue alone, but on her honour, her unselfishness, and her sense
of fair play. I imagined that she was what other women might
become after they had helped men to solve the problem of--yes, of
sex."</p>
<p>"And you think now?" The question was uttered with a sigh; for
Louisa also had known her hopes and her secret
disappointments.</p>
<p>"I've stopped thinking. But I can't see, when I look round me,
that you have invented anything better than the wasp-waist and
the perfect lady."</p>
<p>"You mustn't judge every woman by Mary Victoria, and you
mustn't judge her too harshly. She was desperately in love, you
know."</p>
<p>"Then you've simply come round again in the old vicious
circle. You are fair to each other until you both happen to want
the same man. When you fall in love, you still fight it out in
the jungle. No, it seems to me that poor Aunt Agatha was more
civilized. She was too genteel--too proud, if you please, to
fight over a man."</p>
<p>Louisa shook her head. "I can't argue with you, Virginius. But
you must admit that poor Aunt Agatha is better off to-day than
she was in the Victorian era."</p>
<p>"She has escaped from solitary confinement to the moving
picture. But does that mean anything more than that she is too
elderly to be dangerous? What about Milly Burden to-day?"</p>
<p>"Why, she has fared very well. In the nineteenth century, you
could never have kept her in your office. Even to-day, you
couldn't have done that if Victoria had not been an angel."</p>
<p>"I grant that, especially what you say of Victoria. The
trouble is, I suppose, that I am still too much of an idealist.
When youth was in the saddle, I expected, or at least I hoped,
that it would ride toward the dawn."</p>
<p>Louisa's face softened. "Yes, you are an idealist. But isn't
it unfair to ask of the good women who are really helping the
world, the women, I mean, of ennobling influence, like Victoria
and Mary Victoria, that they should encourage the others, who
are--who are--"</p>
<p>Again that angry tone ruffled his voice. "You may be right
about Victoria, and even about Mary Victoria, but you are wrong
about Milly Burden. She is one of the best women I know," he
asserted defiantly. "There is something about her that reminds me
of you."</p>
<p>To his astonishment, and he reflected that women, even the
more sensible ones, are indeed unaccountable creatures, Louisa
failed to resent the comparison. Instead the shadow of a smile
crossed her face, and she asked with interest, "And what is that
something, Virginius?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell exactly what. A kind of--well, a kind of steady
courage in facing reality. She is the bravest woman I've ever
known."</p>
<p>He had expected not only dissent, but imperative
contradiction, and he was puzzled, an instant later, by the
softened wonder in Louisa's expression. "I can't understand you,
Virginius," she said presently. "You talk almost like
Marmaduke."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we have more in common than I imagined. We both
inherit wild roses and snowy landscapes."</p>
<p>She looked bewildered but emphatic. "Don't you think you may
need a change after those hard cases? Now that you have won them
both, couldn't you take a rest?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am resting. All I do in the office is to put my brisk
young men to work." Then, changing his tone, he asked abruptly,
"Is Victoria really disturbed?"</p>
<p>"She is anxious, and I think fearful that a break may come
while Mary Victoria is in this condition. Of course, everything
has looked darker since she discovered that Martin has been
visiting Milly."</p>
<p>"Well, I refuse to credit that even now. Milly is an honest
woman, and she is no longer infatuated. She told me only a few
weeks ago that she hated the very sound of his name."</p>
<p>"My dear Virginius, she may do that and still be in love with
him. The trouble with you lawyers is that you try to reduce love
to logic, and it has never been done since the dawn of creation.
This isn't a point of view, you must remember, but a mortal
passion. It is neither old nor new, for it is an everlasting
purpose."</p>
<p>"If you wish it," he said impulsively, "I will ask Milly if
she ever sees him."</p>
<p>"Well, ask her. As long as she has nothing to lose, she may
tell you the truth."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can trust her to tell me the truth," he replied, with a
stronger confidence in his voice than he felt in his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c304" id="c304">IV</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>All day, while the energetic young men of the firm asked his
advice or obeyed his commands, Mr. Littlepage sat in his private
office and meditated, in the lull between cases, upon the
problems of life. Instead of decreasing, it seemed to him that
these problems, especially the more sentimental ones, which might
naturally be expected to diminish with age, had thickened like
shadows in the declining sun of his years. Not only had his
autumnal romance absorbed all the glamour and beauty of youth;
but since his significant talk with Louisa, he had suffered from
an aching pity for Mary Victoria. Judge her as harshly as he
dared, she was still his only daughter, and he was paternal by
nature. Though none of his children had given him the
companionship that he craved, he was the last man in the world to
discard the obligations of blood. Well, life was like that, he
supposed, and the obligations could be depended upon to outlast
the pleasures. Had any man, had even Methuselah, ever really had
what he wanted? Women, perhaps, won their way; but this was
because they expected less from mortal experience, as well as
from the opposite sex. They accepted life as it is; they were the
only pragmatic philosophers. Victoria, for example, had
acquiesced in foregone conclusions; she had been content with
what came to her; she had never defied the tyranny of appearances
that wars against happiness. Yes, Victoria had known how to live.
Except for the loss of her children in infancy and this
disastrous affair of Mary Victoria's, she might have been
perfectly happy. Even Mary Victoria's marriage, he suspected, had
not appeared hopeless to her until she had watched Martin rushing
at twilight in the obscure direction of Juniper Hill. And yet, in
spite of Victoria's alarm, he told himself that Martin's
adventure may not have been serious. In the good old days, when
people had proper ideals and marriage was respected, men had
stolen or rushed, according to their habits of mind or the
elasticity of their arteries, in the pursuit of every glittering
delight; yet nobody, least of all the unfaithful husband, had
considered that any institution was menaced. But, menaced or not,
he decided at last, he could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, when Milly brought him a pile of
letters, he looked at her with an unspoken question, while he
entreated the law of precedent to provide him with an auspicious
beginning. Every minute that he wasted made the task, he knew,
only the more difficult; for when he looked back, he was reminded
that Milly had never responded successfully to even the most
delicate interrogation. At the first direct question, he was
prepared to see that soft, inscrutable reserve spread in a silken
mask over her features. Only her eyes, strangely living and
defiant, would still flicker like blue fires beneath her winged
eyebrows. To be sure, his mission had appeared simple enough in
the keen, dry air of Louisa's intelligence. Asking questions,
however impertinent, was easy to a mind, undeterred by moral
weakness, that enjoyed doing its duty. Here in his office,
however, with Milly sitting there so quietly, his resolution was
no longer as clear as sunlight shining through glass. That
transparent certainty, he realized now, had sprung, not from his
own, but from Louisa's unshakable purpose. With his dignified
head bent over his desk, thinking, thinking, while he played with
his pen, he knew that he could never speak aloud the question
that was gnawing its way through his thoughts. Yet all he had to
do was to look straight into Milly's eyes and ask quietly: "Do
you ever see Martin? Did you see Martin last night?"</p>
<p>Lifting his glance from the paper, he said suddenly,</p>
<p>"It feels like spring, Milly."</p>
<p>She looked beyond him and over the bare boughs to the western
sky. "Yes, it feels like spring."</p>
<p>"You ought to get out of doors. You look tired."</p>
<p>"I was up last night. Mother had neuralgia."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear that. Is she better?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she's all right. It was the kind of neuralgia that comes
when she is in low spirits."</p>
<p>"I hope she has had nothing new to depress her?"</p>
<p>"Nothing new? No, there isn't anything new. She is still
worrying because father didn't do his duty to her."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad she wasn't worrying about you. I thought,
perhaps, you had told her you were going away."</p>
<p>Milly looked at him gravely. "Oh, that isn't new. She has
worried over that for the last year."</p>
<p>"Do you really think you are going away, Milly?"</p>
<p>Her eyes left him and wandered again to the sky. "I am going
as soon as I can," she replied slowly.</p>
<p>"You want to get away, then, as much as ever?" Was he nearer
her secret? Did she suspect that he was sounding her heart for
the violence of her old passion?</p>
<p>"Oh, more than ever!" her voice quivered with longing. "I want
to go more than ever."</p>
<p>"Is there, my child, a particular reason?"</p>
<p>"Isn't there," she hesitated, with suspended breath, while her
gaze clung to the sky, "a particular reason for--everything?"</p>
<p>He took up his pen, wrote his name at the end of a letter, and
remarked with a smile, "I am taking things easy to-day."</p>
<p>"You ought to, after all that work. It was wonderful, winning
those two cases."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was fortunate, but I can feel it, somehow."</p>
<p>"That is because you are tired." Her face had softened with
interest, and he thought how lovely she would be if she were
happy. Poor child, she had been over a rough road. It was unfair;
it was deplorable; but Victoria had said that there was nothing
they could do except send her away and provide for her
mother.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am tired," he admitted presently, "but after this I
shall begin to take things easier. I refuse to drop dead from
overwork as so many men of my age are doing."</p>
<p>"No, you mustn't." Her voice was gentle, and she seemed
attentive, but there was, he thought, a shimmering vagueness
about her.</p>
<p>"You ought to take up some other interest, too, Milly. Have
you ever wanted to try golf?"</p>
<p>"No, that wouldn't help."</p>
<p>"What would help, my dear?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know." The light died in her face and she looked
away again. "Nothing, I suppose."</p>
<p>"I'll do anything to help you," he said, with genuine
emotion.</p>
<p>"Well, help me to get away. All I want in the world is to go
away."</p>
<p>"We are helping you. Mrs. Littlepage will look after your
mother, and I've already arranged about that position in New
York. Much as I shall hate to lose you, I'll do everything that I
can. After all, it may be for the best."</p>
<p>"It is for the best, if only mother will see it."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, after a while, she will be reasonable. The old must
learn that they cannot stand in the way of the young."</p>
<p>"She cries about it all the time when she isn't crying about
something else. I may have to go without telling her."</p>
<p>"Well, wait a few weeks. Give her a little time, and she may
take a more cheerful view."</p>
<p>Milly shook her head. "No, she'll never take a cheerful view.
She never has in her life. She thinks they are wrong."</p>
<p>"That is unfortunate," he concluded, though he was aware that
the concession went no deeper than his throat, "but, after all,
she is your mother."</p>
<p>"Does that give her the right," Milly demanded passionately,
"to ruin my life?"</p>
<p>He looked vaguely troubled. "I thought you had forgotten that
old senseless charge, Milly. At least, you owe her some
consideration for having brought you into the world."</p>
<p>"I had no choice. I did not ask to be born."</p>
<p>"You are unreasonable, my dear. Didn't she look after you and
bring you up when your father deserted you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he would have taken me, but she wouldn't let him. He used
to send us something as long as he lived. Of course, she did her
duty," she continued recklessly, "but I despise the word
'duty'!"</p>
<p>He frowned and shook his head. "I don't know what the world is
coming to, my child. Have you really no spark of affection left
for your mother?"</p>
<p>For a long moment, Milly pondered the question. "I am sorry
for her," she said at last, "but I don't like her. I never liked
her, not even when I was little."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage gazed at her with startled wonder--or was it
horror?--in his expression. "Your own mother! It seems
incredible. But so many things that I once thought incredible
have become mental habits with the younger generation."</p>
<p>"I should hate to think that she was in want," Milly said
thoughtfully, after a longer and deeper reflection. "I am willing
to work for her, but I cannot live with her. If I knew that I
should never have to live with her," she continued in a voice of
desperate calmness, "I might even begin to be fond of her."</p>
<p>"In a measure I can understand," Mr. Littlepage replied, with
his judicial manner. "In any case, it is useless to pretend that
family ties are as strong as they used to be."</p>
<p>Milly looked at him so steadily that he glanced, in his turn,
at the western sky. "Haven't family ties," she asked, "always
made more trouble than any other thing in the world?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, my child." She had drawn his gaze back to her.
"In my youth we were taught that only monsters were without
family feeling. No matter what the family was, the feeling was
supposed to be there."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Well, perhaps I am a monster; but even if I am a
monster, I am real. I know you can't force yourself to love
people. You can only pretend."</p>
<p>"Much of the old family feeling was, no doubt, a sham; but I
dare say it was useful in creating an illusion of stability. But
did you," he asked more sternly, "never love anyone but this
unworthy young man?"</p>
<p>Again she pondered his question. "I loved father when I was
little, but he couldn't live with us."</p>
<p>"He deserted your mother most cruelly. A decent man," Mr.
Littlepage declared, with warmth, "does not desert his wife,
especially when he has nothing against her."</p>
<p>"Nothing but duty. He couldn't live with mother's duty. Nobody
could. Even I couldn't; and I've been so unhappy that you would
think I could live with almost anything."</p>
<p>"Yes, you have been unhappy," he assented, with feeling, "but
are you wrong to insist that your mother ruined your life. Wasn't
that your own doing?"</p>
<p>Milly's lips closed more firmly, while that deep blue flame in
her eyes flickered and died down. "No, I didn't ruin it," she
answered slowly. "I didn't ruin it."</p>
<p>Though this shocked him, he was prepared for her unreconciled
attitude. After all, people to-day were more hopeful about
everything, he reminded himself, than they used to be, even about
ruined lives and eternal damnation. Perhaps Marmaduke was right,
and the Victorians had made too much fuss about souls, especially
lost ones.</p>
<p>"I've always believed that you are a good girl, Milly," he
said, with stronger sympathy but weaker conviction.</p>
<p>She looked at him gravely while she fingered her pencil.
"Mother wouldn't agree with you. She used to tell me about a
murderess who was hanged in sixty-something for killing three
persons, and she never failed to remark, 'But she wasn't a bad
woman.'"</p>
<p>"I know," he returned a little grimly. "They used to feel that
way. However," he added in a lighter tone, "I still think you a
good girl."</p>
<p>Her lips twitched in mockery. "You mean because I've never
forgotten anybody but myself?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it is something like that."</p>
<p>"Well, mother thinks exactly the opposite. According to what
she was taught, you may hurt anybody you please, you may even
commit murder and be hanged for it, but you are still an honest
woman so long as you haven't forgotten yourself."</p>
<p>"Is anything sacred to you, Milly?" he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>Her face grew stern. "Truth would be, if I could find it.
Truth that you could really believe in, not just shams and
labels."</p>
<p>"Well, it wouldn't matter if you were happy. But you aren't
happy."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm happy." The flame leaped up again in gay derision.
"Isn't everybody happy?"</p>
<p>"Some are happier than others."</p>
<p>"I know," she said, with sudden earnestness. "The happy ones
are those who have found something worth loving." Then rising
from her chair, she stood attentive, composed, competent. "Is
that all?" she asked in an expressionless voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, that is all." Looking at his watch, he remembered that
he had promised to drop in and advise Mrs. Dalrymple about her
future. He thought of the friendly and cheerful room, warm in
colour, fragrant with cedar-logs. He thought of her, as she
awaited him, soft, glowing, submissive, with her hair that was
still golden, her eyes that were like dark flowers in moonlight,
her fruity mellowness that reminded him of the bloom on a
sun-ripened peach. Ah, there was a woman who knew men! There was
a woman who had made of love a delight, not a disaster! There, in
that glowing room, was rest alike from moral indecision and
mental exertion!</p>
<p>"Yes, that is all," he repeated in a tone that was vibrant
with hope. Not until Milly had taken the letters and closed the
door after her did it occur to him that he had never asked her
the one question he wished her to answer. What he knew of
Martin's infidelity was exactly as much as he had known when she
came into the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c305" id="c305">V</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrs. Dalrymple was alone when he entered, and while she rose
from her inviting sofa and trailed toward him in a tea-gown of
pale yellow chiffon, he breathed in the intoxicating perfume of
her emotion. Ah, if only woman had consented to remain the
delight and the relaxation of man! Everything in the room was
soft, restful, flattering to masculine vanity, and kind to the
tarnishing flight of the years. In that fire-coloured glamour,
Mrs. Dalrymple's charm was still magical. While he held her large
white hand, which was a trifle too plump but as soft as a flower,
he heard, above the tumult in his heart, the restless murmuring
like a far-off cluster of honey-bees. A burning sweetness, an
effervescent delight, rippled from his touch to his senses. From
the harsh complexities of modern life, from the fleshless bones
of moral problems, he was sinking back deliciously into the
dreamless slumber of pleasures that are not too important. It was
agreeable to discover that nothing, least of all the bidding of
conscience, which decreed that his duty was elsewhere, had
altered in Mrs. Dalrymple's company. For the hour, he was living
again in a man's world. Mrs. Dalrymple, notwithstanding her war
record, was still a woman whom one desired but did not respect.
What a help, what a support are definite classifications, he
reflected, as he sat down beside her, and defended his masculine
courage from his legal precaution. Had Mrs. Dalrymple been a good
woman; had she been even a perfect lady, serious complications
might have ensued. Not only might a sense of duty have preceded
him in her affections, but the solid burden of responsibility
might have dampened, if it had not extinguished, the pure delight
of his senses. It was encouraging to remember (though he was
chivalrous at heart) that he was not responsible for what
happened, that he was not even involved, except remotely, as the
husband of some other woman. For, as every gentleman of the
Victorian era was well aware, he could not become involved,
except remotely, with a woman who had first forgotten herself
with somebody else. All that was expected of a man, if he were
profligate, was to enjoy and forget, or, after the habit of Mr.
Littlepage, if he were temperate, was to enjoy and regret.</p>
<p>Sitting there in that rosy glamour, he found that instead of
profiting by the occasion in a way which would meet the
requirements of contemporary fiction, he was seduced into
meditation upon the perishable nature of woman's attraction. At a
distance, he had longed passionately, with all the heated fervour
of youth, for this moment; but basking now in the warm firelight,
he told himself that he had no intention of being faithless to
his vows of monogamy. Once again, in spite of his vehement
desires, he found that habit, as a controlling motive, is
superior to impulse. Once again, he said to himself, with his
sombre eyes on the ripened fruit of Mrs. Dalrymple's bosom, he
was doomed to hesitate and fail on the very brink of
fulfilment.</p>
<p>While he hesitated, Mrs. Dalrymple, who had decided long ago
that the tastes of Southern gentlemen are languishing, raised her
eyes to his flushed features and began to coo in her most
mellifluous notes. "If only I could make you realize how much you
have helped me."</p>
<p>"I wish I could have done more," he responded sincerely.
"Anybody could have given you that advice."</p>
<p>She bowed her head, and the firelight danced over all the
amber waves, from the gleaming crown to the fluffy little curls
that protected her ears. "I believe I'd rather have them too fast
than too slow," she was thinking, "slowness always makes me so
nervous; but it is perfectly true that the faster they are, the
quicker you lose them. No matter what anybody tells you," she
mused more deeply, since Mr. Littlepage showed no sign of
hurrying his impulses, "no matter what anybody tells you, nothing
compares with stinginess when it comes to holding a man. No
sooner have you bound one to you with ties of generosity or
pleasure or gratitude, than some woman with real stinginess
appears, and all your labour goes for naught. The trouble with me
is that I've cheapened myself from the most generous motives. It
has taken all these years to teach me that no man ever put the
proper value upon a bargain." Sighing, she continued presently to
herself, after a glance at her companion, "If I had my live to
life over again, I'd make it a rule to give away nothing.
Nothing! Not an old dress, not a bad penny, not even a kiss."</p>
<p>"Anybody could have given you that advice," Mr. Littlepage
repeated suddenly, which was exactly what he had said five
minutes before. Slowness had been always, she told herself, the
peculiar flaw in this kind of love-making. Well, perhaps, for all
she had heard to the contrary, this might prove in the end to be
merely another blessing in disguise. If he had not been so slow
in the past, this affair might be already over and done with, and
then, in the hour of her greatest necessity, she might have been
left stranded for lovers. Slow but sure! Had not those restful
traits been paired off in a proverb? And after fifty, no matter
how well-preserved, a woman knows how to appreciate staying power
in a lover.</p>
<p>Cheered but not enlivened by these reflections, she said aloud
in her softest accents, "You can't imagine how much it has meant
to me. Even more than your advice, your wonderful sympathy has
helped me to hold up my head."</p>
<p>"Well, you must keep it up now, my dear lady. There isn't any
reason why you shouldn't. The world isn't so harsh as it used to
be."</p>
<p>"But I never forget. No one to look at me would dream I have a
deep nature. People think that I am volatile because I dance and
go to the cinema. They don't understand that I am only trying to
escape from myself."</p>
<p>Indeed, indeed. He looked down at her compassionately while he
patted her hand. Such sensibility, no doubt, was old-fashioned,
but it was also very feminine. Even though he preferred the light
to the heavy touch in love-making that involved no serious
responsibility, he was genuinely moved by Mrs. Dalrymple's
confession. Strange, how he had misjudged her! Strange, how he
had misjudged anything so obvious as her old affection for
him!</p>
<p>"You have been very brave, I know," he said gently, while pity
broke out in a moist heat over his forehead.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you," she murmured presently, "how much it means
to me to find that you haven't forgotten."</p>
<p>"No, I haven't forgotten." After all, he thought as he looked
at her primrose-coloured draperies, women are more graceful in
tea-gowns.</p>
<p>"When I went away twelve years ago," she said caressingly,
while she insisted in an inaudible but more positive tone that
you frightened men away if you began to talk about yourself, "I
thought that you no longer respected me."</p>
<p>He shook his head in denial. "I am sorry. I feared that we had
made a mistake, but I blamed only myself."</p>
<p>She sighed and wiped a tear from her lashes. "I was weak, I
know, but I felt that you were so strong." Was that really too
serious? she wondered. Or would the epithet "strong," which she
had found so efficacious in turning rabbit souls into lion
hearts, quiet the moral scruples that were now making
trouble?</p>
<p>"I blamed only myself," he repeated, which was true as far as
it went. A pleasant fire ran through his veins and flickered out
in that obscure region where conscience resides. More years than
he liked to remember had flown since a woman had sighed because
he was too strong for her; and Mr. Littlepage, who knew his own
weakness, felt that strength was the attribute in which he
preferred to excel. Looking down, in fear rather than reproach,
on Mrs. Dalrymple's curls, and listening to the soft, irregular
pulse in her throat, he found himself regretting the lost
capacity of youth to yield to temptation. "I suppose I'm not cut
out for a philanderer," some detached, ironic spectator in his
mind thought as clearly as if it occupied a box at a concert.
"After all, few natural bents are harder to overcome than a fixed
habit of fidelity." In his private office, or between the cool
linen sheets of his twin bed, he had believed himself to be a
match for any occasion. But here, in this rosy enchantment, where
temptation, as it seemed to him, was almost too free and bold to
be tempting, he admitted reluctantly that he was inadequate to
the exacting, if silent, demands of a guilty passion. Though he
still desired Mrs. Dalrymple, he was content, at least for the
present, to desire her less as a happy lover than as a
disappointed idealist. For, in common with the best masculine
taste of the great tradition, he preferred sin on the stage and
elsewhere when it was treated in the grand manner, with an
orchestral accompaniment. Without musical or at least dramatic
support, he felt that it left one entirely too much at the mercy
of one's appetites; and appetites, though useful in evolution,
are superfluous in the finished product of a Southern
gentleman.</p>
<p>While he reclined there in the firelight, stroking Mrs.
Dalrymple's hand, which reminded him of a particularly large and
fine magnolia blossom, the idea dawned slowly upon him that his
respectful manner of love-making was not giving complete
satisfaction. Though the last thing he wished for was a costly,
or even a complimentary, affair in his life (having too often
arranged the fruits of such intrigues), he was still as sensitive
as other men in his vanity, and it wounded him to have any woman
imagine that he was deficient in a lower nature. For the first
time, it occurred to him to regret that a woman with a past,
however stimulating to the emotions, could so seldom be anything
else. The changeable moods of man were familiar to him; but he
told himself now that the failure of the <i>grande amoureuse</i>
was in variety. He had never known a woman with a past (except
the unwomanly Milly) who seemed to him to have even the weakest
grasp upon either the present or the future. Frailty was, no
doubt, very attractive; a broken heart made an irresistible
appeal to a chivalrous mind; but, since change is the only
permanent law of our nature, Mr. Littlepage reflected that even
frailty might be expected to harden and broken hearts to become
whole again. Certainly such a sanguine view of tragedy was more
American, if less romantic. A passive attitude, even in
repentance, he told himself, was not only out of place in a march
of progress, but impressed the citizens of our Republic as
antiquated and incompetent.</p>
<p>"If only I could see more of you." Mrs. Dalrymple's inviting
tone broke in upon his meditations like the amorous note of a
dove in the spring. Had she, once again, she questioned mutely,
lost sight in her folly of the timid nature of lovers? Had her
restless vitality overleaped her discretion and her expert
knowledge of men? Well, after all, even if he were the only one
on her hook, she reminded herself, with robust but homely wisdom,
there are as good fish in the sea as have ever come out of it.
Though she told herself that she was prepared to fall in love
with him, if the prospect appeared sufficiently promising, she
was under no delusion as to what the venture might hold for her.
For she had observed that the law of diminishing returns rules in
love as in everything else. Like most of her married lovers, Mr.
Littlepage, she surmised, would probably prove to be just rather
than generous in illicit relations, and as careful as other
unfaithful husbands to keep the more durable presents within the
family. Yet, knowing these things, she sighed again, in obedience
to some deep instinct that was older and wiser than knowledge,
"If only I could see more of you, I should have something to look
forward to."</p>
<p>"Couldn't you," he asked gently, "take an interest in some
good work? In some--cause or charity?" Much as he disliked
philanthropists, there were situations, he felt, in which one was
compelled to resort to desperate remedies.</p>
<p>She shook her perfectly arranged head, which had been
arranged, she reminded herself, not for philanthropy, but for
adventure. "I never took any interest in such things."</p>
<p>"Nor do I. I don't like reformers, but, after all, you need
something to occupy your time. As Duncan says, we cannot have a
world war every day."</p>
<p>A sigh escaped her. "Ah, I haven't any life now. I live
entirely in the past."</p>
<p>"But that's a mistake, my dear lady. The past, however
painful, is over and done with. You are young yet. You are as
attractive as you ever were. You look every whit as handsome to
me as you did the first time I saw you."</p>
<p>Turning slightly, she enveloped him in one of the celebrated
smiles of the 'nineties. "I was a beauty--why shouldn't I say
it?--in another period. We had hearts in those days."</p>
<p>"And they were broken," he answered in a troubled tone, while
the moist heat cooled to chill dampness on his forehead.</p>
<p>Her eyes, as glimmering as twilight, dwelt on him tenderly.
"What else, my dear, are hearts for?" she asked, with a delicious
revival of last-century archness.</p>
<p>"What else?" he repeated daringly; and reflected that if only
she could sustain her sprightly mood, the evening might become
more agreeable. Smiling into her dangerous eyes, he thought of
all the ballroom floors and other public places where Mrs.
Dalrymple had held court, as a crowned queen, in the early
'nineties, and he thought also, though less cheerfully, of the
long procession of Southern gentlemen who had vied with one
another for the honour of holding her bouquet when she danced.
That was, he hastened to recall, before the noisy scandal of her
divorce; for, after the judicious retreat of her first lover,
Southern gentlemen had flocked to her not in processions, but in
single combat, and had shown a disposition to seek quiet corners
rather than crowded ballrooms. And then, gradually and
imperceptibly, tastes had altered, and the late Victorian ideal
of beauty had gone out of fashion. Vanished also, or surviving
with a faded splendour, was the brilliant archness, the
irresistible coquetry, which had turned the more nimble or less
solid wits of the nineteenth century. Yes, the truth was (he
perceived this in the very act of denying it) that she had had
her long and glorious day and was now ending. Never again, except
in the delusive pages of fiction, would the great Victorian ideal
inflame the emotions and the imaginations of men.</p>
<p>"I thought once you might teach me that." Her upraised eyes
challenged him while the playful tone of her voice smoothed away
his alarm. "If only I could see you now and then."</p>
<p>"Of course, you must see me. It is always," he added, fearful
yet resigned, "a pleasure to see you."</p>
<p>"Queenborough has changed so much that I feel like a stranger.
So few of my old friends appear to remember me."</p>
<p>"Then you must make new ones. I told you how highly my
daughter praises your war record."</p>
<p>"Yes, she was kind to me when we were in the Balkans together.
But I wasn't thinking of the younger generation. That is friendly
enough. Only the women I used to know have never forgiven
me."</p>
<p>He smiled consolingly. "They will when you begin to look as
old as they do." This was the kind of thing, he told himself,
that every woman of her age and experience expected. For the
conversation was flowing again into the old channels, and nothing
more, he knew, was required of him than a willing surrender to
the warm and slow-moving current. "After all," he continued, with
his whimsical humour, "you must confess that you never cared much
for women."</p>
<p>"No, they didn't seem worth bothering about. I suppose you
would call me a man's woman. That may be the reason," she added
gravely, visited by a flash of penetration, "why I had so few
friends when I needed them."</p>
<p>"But men still befriended you." Though he tried to make his
voice steady, he could not subdue the nervous tremor that
afflicted his mind. After a quarter of a century, his conscience
still accused him when he remembered her loneliness while the
storm broke over her head. Such a lovely head it was then and
even to-day; so high, so proud, so like a golden rose in its airy
grace. To be sure, he had done more than the rest to protect her;
but had he, in the face of his accusing conscience, done all that
he could? While her guilty lover had dashed for the storm-proof
shelter of marriage, the beauty that allured men for pleasure had
failed to hold them, Mr. Littlepage mused, in the hour of
adversity.</p>
<p>"Are men ever more than fair-weather friends to a man's
woman?" she asked, with the capricious gaiety he had never
forgotten.</p>
<p>"You know that is not true," he answered, while his reverie
warmed and melted beneath her sprightliness. "You know that is
not true." Something--was it the transforming glow of the flames
or the misty radiance in her eyes?--awakened the living memory of
that August evening. As he lost himself in that summer darkness,
the old desire and the old ecstasy drummed again in his pulses.
"You know that is not true, Amy," he repeated heavily, as if he
were in a trance or asleep.</p>
<p>In another instant he would have embraced his illusion. In
another instant he would have held out his arms to that misty
radiance, to that startled surprise, which tempted and eluded him
in her face. But, while he reached toward her, in the very flash
and pause with which she surrendered, a trivial incident, as
insignificant as the turning on of a light in the hall, shattered
the crystal globe of the moment. A bell rang; a step passed; and
he heard a messenger asking a question.</p>
<p>Collecting himself with an effort, he looked at his watch. "It
is late. I must go," he said, but his voice was thick and clotted
with longing.</p>
<p>With a gesture, she seemed to put herself in order, to smooth
her shining hair, to reassemble her faculties. "Must you really
go?"</p>
<p>"What else can I do?"</p>
<p>"But you'll come again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I'll come again. Haven't I," he asked, with playful
evasion, "always come again?"</p>
<p>"After twelve years?" she sighed, and he thought that she
looked suddenly older and more tarnished. The glow had wavered
down in her eyes, but they were still dark and unfathomable.</p>
<p>"Oh, it won't be twelve years this time!" he exclaimed in a
mood that was more tender than thunderous. "It may be
to-night."</p>
<p>"If you cared, you wouldn't go," she said breathlessly. How
intense women were, even the lightest, the loosest! Why were they
never satisfied to turn from one thing to another, as every man
in the world was able to do?</p>
<p>"But I can't stay. Amy, you know I can't stay."</p>
<p>Her eyes were wet as she looked at him. "Will you promise me
to come back to-night?"</p>
<p>"If I can, if I can possibly arrange it, I will come back
to-night." Did she really care for him, he wondered, oppressed by
the responsibility, or was she obeying some general law of
woman's impulse to cling? What illogical memories women
possessed! What disastrous loyalties! True, he craved the lost
flavour of youth; true, he longed, in safe places, for the
perilous fires of romance. But he knew now, beyond any doubt,
that the only romance he needed was the kind that did not give
serious trouble. Prudent rather than possessive, he kissed her
clinging lips, and turned quickly away.</p>
<p>As the door closed behind him, Mrs. Dalrymple gazed pensively
into her most becoming mirror, which hung over a vase of yellow
roses on a graceful Heppelwhite table. While his steps still
echoed from the flagged walk to the gate, she sighed with weary
resignation. "I shall probably never see him again." Then, more
in pity than in resentment, she added sorrowfully, "I don't
believe he has a spark of true manhood."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c306" id="c306">VI</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Outside, in the cool violet dusk, Mr. Littlepage waited
patiently while his brief flare of passion faded and died. He was
glad that he had escaped; and yet had life, he questioned
regretfully, ever meant to him anything more affirmative than an
escape from experience? Had he ever lived intensely except in
those imaginary shadows cast by actual adventures? Well, he had
been true to his ideals; and though he had been true to his
ideals, a profound melancholy descended upon him. Far overhead,
above the living gleam in the west, he saw pale flower-like
clusters of stars, and he thought disconsolately of spring, time,
eternity, which flowed there into emptiness. Standing in Mrs.
Dalrymple's garden, he was visited again by an aching sense of
the evanescence of happiness. And not only of happiness, but of
all animate and inanimate forms--of the street, the houses, the
trees, the inaccessible heavens, and the secret recesses of his
own changeable nature. After all, were the meshes of the
actuality in which he was struggling more permanent than the
afterglow in the sky or this false spring of the heart? Suddenly,
while he lingered there, imagination played its old trick in his
mind. "Nothing is over," he thought hopefully. "She is still
here, and I may see her again. I may see her to-night."</p>
<p>He walked slowly between the borders of boxwood, and passed
out upon the pavement just as Martin Welding turned the corner
with his rapid stride, which always left an impression of flight.
For an instant, so strong was his dislike for his son-in-law, Mr.
Littlepage felt a temptation to retreat behind Mrs. Dalrymple's
gate. Then courage overcame discretion, and he advanced with the
most careless manner he could bring to his aid.</p>
<p>"Well, Martin!--" His greeting had begun briskly, but before
the bleak despair in the young man's face, he broke into the
startled question. "Is anything wrong?"</p>
<p>Stopping so suddenly that he was obliged to catch hold of the
gate, Martin asked bitterly, "Is anything right?"</p>
<p>"You look as if you were suffering."</p>
<p>"Do I? Well, I was wondering how long I could stand it."</p>
<p>"Are you in pain?"</p>
<p>"I am in hell, if that interests you."</p>
<p>"It doesn't interest, it distresses me."</p>
<p>In the waning light Martin's features wore a drawn and ravaged
look, as if he were devoured by an incurable malady. His skin had
always seemed lacking in health to Mr. Littlepage (for all skins
that had remained long in France appeared to him unnatural); but
there was more here, he told himself now, than the result of
sleepless nights and an over-indulgence in absinthe and bad
habits. Even to Mr. Littlepage, who had little use for the
twilight zone of psychology, it was evident that Martin's ailment
was some obscure and mortal distress of the soul. "He stayed too
long in Europe," Virginius thought, and remembering Mary
Victoria's triumphant mission to the Balkans, he added hastily,
"nobody ought to stay too long in Europe unless he has the moral
fibre to stand it." From the first it had been clear to him, and
to the rest of Queenborough, if not to Paris, that Martin was
wanting in moral stamina.</p>
<p>"I am sorry." The young man's burning eyes stared back at him
from a face that was swept bare of expression. Why was he
suffering like this? How could anyone suffer like this when there
was no visible cause?</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell me about it and let me help you?" the
older man asked with all the sympathy that he could summon.</p>
<p>The merest flicker of gratitude shone in the sullen misery of
Martin's look. "The trouble is that I have come to the end of my
rope. I am wondering how much longer I shall be able to stand
it."</p>
<p>"Stand what, my boy?"</p>
<p>"Stand the whole thing. Stand life, stand marriage, stand
women."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned. "But this isn't normal," he said
sternly. "This isn't rational."</p>
<p>"Well, what am I to do?"</p>
<p>"You should see a physician."</p>
<p>"I've seen dozens of then since I met Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"And what do they say?"</p>
<p>"That I'm not normal, I'm not rational."</p>
<p>"Then, it seems to me, you will have to believe it."</p>
<p>"I do believe it, but that doesn't make it easier. I am still
that way no matter what I believe."</p>
<p>This was serious. Moved in mind as well as heart, Mr.
Littlepage repeated to himself that this was indeed serious. In
the whole of his career he had never, until he was thrown with
Martin, encountered the erratic vision outside of a court of law
(except, perhaps, in the case of poor Aunt Agatha), and he was
attacked now by the superstitious terror an unbalanced reason
inspires in the completely reasonable mind.</p>
<p>"I didn't know it was as grave as this," he said gently, and
with an effort to be reassuring. "Well, we must find a cure. We
must waste no time in finding a cure. You are positive," he
inquired suspiciously, "that you realize the tremendous--yes,
though I dislike exaggeration, I feel that tremendous is not too
big a word--debt of gratitude you owe your wife?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I realize that. Good God! Do you think that I realize
anything else?"</p>
<p>"Have you asked yourself if you have done everything in your
power to make her happy?"</p>
<p>"I can't make her happy. I told her that in the beginning.
Nobody can make another person happy."</p>
<p>"Have you tried?"</p>
<p>"I've tried to do what she wished. What is that accursed bank
but trying to do what she wished?"</p>
<p>"That, of course, is one of her ways of bringing you back to a
normal existence."</p>
<p>"But I don't want to be brought back. I can't be brought back.
I was never there."</p>
<p>"I fear that is true," Mr. Littlepage sighed, "but as least
you might make an effort to govern your faculties. It looks to
me," he added presently, "as if you were in for a nervous
collapse."</p>
<p>"Then it has always been that. The trouble with me is that I
ought never to have been born, and everything I've ever done in
my life has only made that more evident. But so long as I had to
be born," he continued, with passionate resentment, "I might just
as easily have been born in some other part of the world. Could
anything but a machine survive this mass production of mediocrity
you call progress?"</p>
<p>"No doubt there is a grain of truth in what you say," Mr.
Littlepage admitted, not without sympathy. "I sometimes tell
myself that in Queenborough there is no living to-day, there is
only progress."</p>
<p>"Oh, Queenborough isn't any worse than the rest of America.
What you call the American spirit has left itself but one outlet,
and it has paved that with concrete."</p>
<p>"Well, even if that is true, you will feel better about it
when you have recovered your nervous equilibrium. If only you
will try to help us, we may have you all right again in a few
weeks. But we must spare your wife all anxiety."</p>
<p>"Her anxiety doesn't do any good. It only makes matters
worse."</p>
<p>"Are you sincere, then, in saying there is no other
woman?"</p>
<p>"I've had enough of women. Can't you understand," he demanded
bitterly of his father-in-law, "a man's wanting to get away from
every woman on earth?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can understand," Mr. Littlepage assented reluctantly,
and he felt, indeed, that he could. He had known hours, even
days, when he had longed to escape to some desolate polar region
of the mind, where woman, even as an ideal, could not hope to
survive. "The trouble with America," Marmaduke had said, "is that
woman's influence is too heavy."</p>
<p>"If you do," Martin was responding in a quieter tone, "you are
the only one who knows what I mean."</p>
<p>"But you were in a desperate situation, weren't you, when Mary
Victoria found you?"</p>
<p>"God knows I was!"</p>
<p>"If you felt that way, why did you marry?"</p>
<p>"I hoped Mary Victoria could change me. Aren't men always
hoping they can change their spots? And wouldn't you," he
inquired, with a sardonic laugh, "have believed that Mary
Victoria could change anybody?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I should, if I had been in love with her." As he
looked sternly into Martin's despairing face, Mr. Littlepage felt
that his resentment was swept away by compassion. This was his
weakness, he reminded himself, to understand and to pity the
failures of life. "I know how he has suffered," he thought. "I
might feel that way myself if I had had to begin life in poverty
and with an unhealthy imagination." Life! There it was again,
with its cruelties, its frustrations, its beauty, its splendour,
and its unconquerable isolation. There it was, and at its worse,
we could, he meditated, do nothing about it. Beyond the young
man's tormented youth, he looked into the sombre dusk of spring
in winter, and beyond this, he looked still farther into the
starry vastness of space. "Most men have felt like that at least
once in their lives," he replied.</p>
<p>"Even if they have, that doesn't help me," Martin said, with a
strange rasping sound in his throat. "I tell you I am suffocated
by the artificial life I am living."</p>
<p>"Can't you think of your wife? Isn't she in even a worse
plight? For God's sake, be a man!"</p>
<p>"It's no use. I am not that kind of man."</p>
<p>With his eyes on those wasted and unnatural features, Mr.
Littlepage softened his tone to one of gentle commiseration.
"Well, we can't settle anything here. You will have to collect
yourself before we decide on a way."</p>
<p>"There is no use," Martin said grimly. "I tell you I am
smothering."</p>
<p>"Try to stop thinking about it to-night. Come in with me to
dinner, and to-morrow we will consult Dr. Buchanan. Don't get the
idea into your head that we are unsympathetic. You are an ill
man, that's the way I look at it, and the most important thing is
to build up your health. Why, I came near having a nervous
breakdown myself after the war, and but for Buchanan I might
never have recovered my grip. What you are suffering from, my
boy, is simply lack of proper control. You've got the fear of
life in your mind, and you must put up a stiff fight not to give
in to it."</p>
<p>"I've seen Buchanan," Martin answered, "but he cannot do
anything. Nobody," he insisted stubbornly, looking past his
father-in-law as if he were staring into the face of a spectre,
"can do anything. You can't argue with me because I don't accept
your premise. I don't accept a single one of your fundamental
beliefs. Perhaps I'm rotten inside, or I may be as ill as you
think. Either way doesn't make it any easier for Mary Victoria to
manage me."</p>
<p>"I wonder," Mr. Littlepage asked, with discernment, "if the
trouble is not one of too much managing? Some men cannot stand
being made over."</p>
<p>"I don't know. I don't even care. But you're right about one
thing. Some men ought never to marry."</p>
<p>"Those same men," Mr. Littlepage observed in a tone of rebuke,
"ought to keep clear of women."</p>
<p>"But they seldom do, and I didn't. They are the very ones that
women, especially good women, wish to try their hands on."</p>
<p>"If you cannot be a man, at least don't be a rotter. There's
no sense in this attitude. There's not a particle of reason."</p>
<p>"No, there isn't any reason," Martin assented. "I am not
looking for reason."</p>
<p>"Then give it up for the present, and come into the house.
I'll brave you up with some old Baumgartner before dinner. You
haven't been drinking, have you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not drunk. The kind of stuff you get here doesn't do
any good."</p>
<p>"Well, come in now and stop thinking until you've had your
dinner."</p>
<p>"Did you ever," asked Martin abruptly, "feel that you stood on
the outside of everything and watched the world sliding by?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've felt exactly that way. It is nothing more than the
warning of tired nerves." But was this true? Mr. Littlepage
demanded of himself, with astonishment. Were his moments of
ecstatic vision only the hallucinations of an unbalanced mind?"
There's no use standing here," he continued. "It's getting late,
and Mary Victoria will be anxious. Just try to convince yourself
that there is nothing unusual in your condition. You can't find
anything so strange in this world that somebody else hasn't
thought or felt it before you."</p>
<p>"I wasn't coming in. I was going for a walk," Martin muttered
irresolutely. But there was no heart in his resistance, and he
yielded, almost without a struggle, to the firm grasp of his
father-in-law. "It is foolish to lose patience with him," Mr.
Littlepage was thinking while he hurried the younger man across
the street and up the steps of the house. "A man so far gone as
this isn't accountable."</p>
<p>The door opened as he inserted his key; and with his first
step into the hall, he found that the scent of roses and the
glimmer of firelight from his library restored the lost pleasure
of living.</p>
<p>"Wait for me in the library," he said cheerfully. "I'll be
down as soon as I speak to Victoria." While he turned away the
thought played in his mind, "Victoria will know what ought to be
done. Victoria will know how to deal with him."</p>
<p>He had reached the top of the stairs, and was about to enter
his wife's sitting-room, when the door opened, and against a
stream of rose-coloured light, he saw the pallid features of Mary
Victoria. "Oh, Father, I can't wake her! I've tried and I can't
wake her!"</p>
<p>Frightened as she was, he saw that she was still composed,
still capable, still mistress of herself and any emergency. While
he rushed to the couch under the hanging lamp, he heard her
imperative voice at the telephone; he heard her summon the
doctor; he heard her ring for the servants; he heard her give the
order to send for Louisa. In one instant, as if by the flash of a
signal, she had brought method and purpose into the crisis; she
had banished, or at least subordinated, the aimless impulses of
the heart. With respect and not without repugnance, he watched
her draw aside the rose-coloured robe and apply to her mother's
vacant form all the restorative treatments she had learned in the
war. Only when she had convinced herself that treatment was
useless, did Mary Victoria replace the robe, draw aside from the
couch, and burst into tears. "No one in the world," she cried in
anguish, "could love her as I do!"</p>
<p>"I know, my darling, I know," he answered, folding her in his
arms because he could not bear to meet the stricken look in her
eyes. Why was it, he wondered even now, that he could never
reach, that he could never touch, the real Mary Victoria? Why was
it that, clasping her in his arms, resting her wet cheek against
his, he was still separated from her by that vast isolation of
spirit?</p>
<p>Standing there, in the shower of rose-coloured light, Mr.
Littlepage gazed down on the tranquil form of his wife. Already
the violet pallor of death, the unconquerable finality of the
grave, enveloped her in an impassive remoteness. Her face, which
was turned slightly away from him, in the direction of the
half-open window, was as delicate as porcelain and so luminous in
expression that a faint phosphorescent gleam edged her profile.
In the minutes--or was it hours?--since her death the look of
virginal wonder and surprise had returned to her features. "I
forgive everything. I understand everything," her lips, which had
closed in that magnanimous smile, might have murmured. And this
smile, so bright, so distant, so noble, reminded him of nothing
more human than the smile of a spring meadow or the flashing
curve of a river in sunlight. He had neglected her, he told
himself; he had wearied of her goodness; he had trifled, in the
way of less fortunate husbands, with love and lust. Only an hour
ago, while she lay dying, or perhaps dead, he had been faithless
in spirit; he had been unworthy of her fidelity. Only an hour
ago! Only an hour ago, when she was lying there alone, with that
comprehending yet faintly ironic smile on her lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c307" id="c307">VII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The next Sunday afternoon, two days after Victoria's funeral,
Mr. Littlepage returned from Rose Hill cemetery, where he had
carried fresh flowers, and sat down, alone with his grief, in his
wife's sitting-room. For in his active life, assailed on every
side by the vocal optimism of industry, only on Sunday, after the
morning service was over, could he find an opportunity to indulge
his sorrow at leisure. While he sat there, bowed over her desk,
where her letters had been arranged in neat piles by Louisa, he
clung to his grief with the desperation of a man who realizes, in
the hour of his sharpest distress, that lift is inexorably
ordained for the living, and that time, like an impalpable dust,
is sifting in from the world outside and obliterating the most
passionately cherished remembrance. Bitterly, he reproached
himself. Bitterly, in his heart, he reproached Mrs. Dalrymple.
Bitterly, with the very accents of grief and despair, some
derisive voice in his brain whispered that reproach is even more
fugitive than delight. No matter how deeply he suffered, no
matter how unfalteringly he clung to his dead, nature would
restore itself in the end, and this colourless dust of minutes,
hours, days, would filter in from eternity and settle in a thick
deposit of time over his memory. Though he longed with all his
soul to suffer and remember, he knew that both this longing and
his aching heart were born of an insatiable hunger for life.</p>
<p>Beyond the west window, which was half open, as it had been on
the afternoon of Victoria's death, the dark grey wings of pigeons
were flashing like curved blades against the changeable blue of
the sky. On one of these swift wings, the thought darted into his
mind, "There won't be another day as good for golf in many
weeks." Then, resolutely averting his eyes from the sunshine, he
intoned mutely, as if he were summoning all his faculties in a
ritual of commemoration, "I was not worthy, but I loved her! I
was not worthy, but I loved her!"</p>
<p>In the adjoining bedroom, he heard the footsteps of Louisa
moving to and fro, while she sorted and arranged for charitable
purposes the more intimate belongings of his wife; and these slow
and steady sounds throbbed in a monotonous undercurrent beneath
the mournful refrain of his words. "I was not worthy, but I loved
her! I was not worthy, but I loved her!" Out of some shadowy
region of memory there emerged the face of Victoria as he had
first loved her, serene, passionless, poetic, confronting the
world of illusion with her air of innocence and surprise. This
was her look when he had fallen in love with her, and this was
her look, only more magnanimous in its remoteness, when her lips
had smiled at him in the sleep from which she had never awakened.
Between these two supreme moments of his life, what was left
except an encroaching futility? It was as if all the weariness of
age, all the disappointments, all the thwarted desires, had been
buried beneath that slow accretion of years. Yet he had loved
her. Even when he had neglected her, even when he had been
faithless in heart, he had still loved her. In his early manhood,
he had believed that love meant loyalty, that it meant
benevolence, that it contained some perennially living seed of
kindness and self-sacrifice. Now, looking back, he realized that
this was an error. Either an error of one of those artful
impostures with which the elderly, who knew better, encourage the
dangerous illusions of youth. For love, he understood now, was
not loyalty; it was not loving-kindness; it was not even
tenderness. You might love a woman and yet deceive her; you might
love a woman and yet betray her; you might love a woman and yet
destroy her. You might do anything in love, he saw at last, with
a pang of agony, but cease to remember.</p>
<p>"I never really understood her. I never really appreciated her
goodness," he said in a whisper, as if by forming the words with
his lips he could leave a deeper impression. "She must have
endured anguish this last year, while I never even suspected that
she was dying." Day by day, night by night, they had been
together, and he had lacked the sympathy or the patience to
discover her secret. How brave she had been to the last! How
brave she had looked lying there, and how lonely! He suffered
again, as he had suffered in that false spring dusk, face to
face, with the inscrutable mystery of Martin's despair. Within
four walls, bound together by the indissoluble bonds of
affection, interest, and habit, he had never known, he had never
even seen, the real Victoria.</p>
<p>The footsteps in the adjoining room began again, like echoes
in some broken chords of his memory. They drew nearer, as he
listened, paused for a discreet instant at the threshold, and
lingered there as if some reverent preparation was needed. Then
the door opened slowly and softly, and Louisa entered with a
sympathetic murmur and crossed the floor to Victoria's desk. Her
eyes were red and swollen, and her thin, firm hand, with its
heavy veins and polished nails, trembled with weakness. "I found
this note in her desk, Virginius. It was hidden away in a
drawer."</p>
<p>He reached for the sheet of paper, while his questioning gaze,
the look of a child that is hurt, travelled from Louisa's helpful
hand to her quivering features. By virtue of some natural
aptitude for a crisis, she had been able to enter into their
grief and make their desolation her own.</p>
<p>His gaze fluttered over the paper, and for an instant he
hesitated. "Do you think I had better read it, Louisa?"</p>
<p>"I should if I were you, Virginius. She would wish you to see
it."</p>
<p>Glancing down again, he saw that there were only a few lines,
written in a rapid and infirm hand, as if Victoria had been
overcome by emotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote style="text-align:right;"><i>December</i> 7<i>th</i>,
192--     </blockquote>
<blockquote><i>My dear Husband:</i><br>
<br>
<i>I have known for almost six months that I have a very short
while to live, and my one effort has been to spare you and the
children, to keep you from suspecting. Nothing, I know, can spoil
this last perfect winter, or perhaps year, that we shall all have
together. But, before it is too late, there is something I wish
to say to you</i>--</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Before it is too late there is something I wish to say to
you.</i> Nothing more! The last sentence was slightly blurred, as
if her hand, he told himself, had failed her, and she had waited
until her strength should return. No words that she might have
written, no act, however exalted, could have moved him so deeply.
Faced with that discovery of her mortal illness, she had
forgotten herself, she had thought only of him and her children.
And it was in these last months that he had wronged her in his
heart, that he had betrayed her devotion.</p>
<p>"I know she would wish you to see it," Louisa repeated. "She
suffered a great deal, but her one thought was to spare those she
loved. I have never seen anyone with more courage--or perhaps
fortitude is a better word--than Victoria showed--"</p>
<p>Stunned into silence, he looked upward, over Louisa's neat
grey head, as if he were worshipping at the shrine of some
tutelary divinity. Crowned, radiant, incomparable, a new
Victoria, one whom he had never even imagined, had flowered
there, out of the throbbing light of his vision. Nothing in his
life, not young love, not marriage, not fatherhood, not religious
devotion--none of these emotions had ever plunged so far beneath
the shallows of consciousness. All the beauty of Helen adorned
with the meekness of Mary could not have transformed him so
utterly as this miraculous visitation of pity and terror. For
this Victoria in heaven, who resembled the actual Victoria as
little as a star resembles a glowworm, had won at last his
unalterable fidelity.</p>
<p>"You were more deserving than I, Louisa," he said in the
furtive and hesitating voice in which a man utters the
unutterable. "You are the only one of us who was worthy of her."
For this sudden apotheosis of Victoria had absorbed all the light
and colour from his field of vision, and had left the smaller
human figures drained of vital significance. By that act of
silent heroism, which had cost her so little, Victoria had
triumphed over every rival she had had in the past and over every
rival she might have had in the future. In the presence of the
stainless legend, Mrs. Dalrymple's allurement had wilted like the
crumpled wings of a butterfly. At the funeral he had caught a
glimpse of her charming head in the distance, and a gust of
repugnance, almost of physical aversion, had swept through his
nerves. Yes, this was the kind of thing that must stay by a man
until the end of his life.</p>
<p>"You were a perfect husband, Virginius. She told me only a few
weeks ago that the greatest satisfaction in her life was the
thought that she had been able to make you happy."</p>
<p>"But I wasn't worthy, Louisa!" The cry rushed out in a torrent
of anguish.</p>
<p>"You mustn't think that, Virginius." Louisa laid her
comforting hand on his shoulder. "You mustn't let that idea begin
to brood in your mind. Victoria would never have wished you to
nurse your grief. She didn't believe in selfish grief. She has
said to me so often in the past, 'Louisa, I hope to leave only
happy memories!'"</p>
<p>His eyes were looking inward, and there was a strange clear
light in them. "Happy memories. That was why--"</p>
<p>"Yes, that was why."</p>
<p>"She knew all the time, but she was perfectly cheerful."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, she was perfectly cheerful. Even as a child she had
the sunniest disposition."</p>
<p>"I could bear it better," he said suddenly, while the idea
flitted through Louisa's orderly mind that men never stop being
children so long as there is a woman to look after them, "I could
bear it better if only these last few months had been
different."</p>
<p>"Different?"</p>
<p>"I mean if I'd thought more of her. Do you know I have a
terrible feeling that I never really knew what she was, that I
never really saw her until she was dead."</p>
<p>"That is taking a morbid view of your grief, Virginius. You
remember how Victoria disliked morbid views of death."</p>
<p>She had taken off her glasses to wipe them, and now, as she
returned them to her reddened nose, her features appeared to
settle into their usual composure. Though her devotion to
Victoria had been deep and genuine, the precise equilibrium of
her mind had not been disturbed by her sorrow. For her, death had
softened rather than magnified Victoria's virtues. She beheld her
now, not as she had seen her a few days before, good, gentle,
incapable of malice, and hopeful by nature rather than
intelligence, but finished, harmless, undissembling as a dove,
and blindly at the mercy of life. Yet this, she told herself,
with accurate judgment, was an error of sentiment. Living or
dead, Victoria would triumph. Because she was one with the doves
of life, at least in the mind of Virginius, her memory would
remain invulnerable to disaster. Or was this also a mistake?
Would she be preserved from oblivion, not by merit alone, but by
the benign embalming medium of circumstances? To Louisa's
startled horror some small, malicious demon of irony spoke
suddenly from the primitive jungle of consciousness, "Was it
because she felt her way instead of seeing it that she reached
everlasting remembrance? Or was it simply because dullness, if it
is sweet tempered, will outwear every form of activity?"</p>
<p>Amazed, helpless; for even in a mind as neat and frugal as
Louisa's thoughts are not numbered, she said hurriedly, while the
cold glitter of her eyeglasses transfixed his grief:</p>
<p>"Try to do what she would have wished, Virginius. We must both
forget ourselves and think of Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>He assented without animation. "I suppose people are obliged
to forget. That is the worst part of death. No matter how much
you want to keep the past alive, the business of living is too
much for you. You can't keep dust from settling over anything
that is motionless. In remembering Mary Victoria we shall forget
Victoria."</p>
<p>"No, not forget." She was firm about this, for such an idea
was not only fruitless but morbid. "Don't you remember that when
little Edward died soon after he was born, Victoria would not let
herself give way and brood. She told me that you said to her then
that life must always be for the living."</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember," he replied, vaguely consoled. Few women, he
mused, a moment later, possessed Louisa's infallible touch on a
wounded heart. In the last few days he had reminded himself so
often of Victoria's description of her as "a rock to lean on." He
had even reproached himself for the flippancy with which he had
dismissed her in the past as a sterling character, but one of
those women, in spite of Marmaduke's long wooing, whom men did
not marry. Now, in the hour of affliction, he was beginning to
realize that, even in marriage, there is much to be said in
favour of a rock-ribbed foundation.</p>
<p>"I don't know what we should have done without you, Louisa,"
he said gratefully. "Especially Mary Victoria. You are like a
second mother to the poor child."</p>
<p>A tear trickled down Louisa's nose under her glasses. "Well,
I've always been that way, Virginius. Victoria's children are as
dear to me as if they were my own. There isn't anybody," she
added, "not even you, who will miss Victoria more than I
shall."</p>
<p>"I know that," he assented, and felt suddenly very close to
her. "Well, you must help us all you can. You must tell me when I
am wrong about Mary Victoria. There are times when I feel that I
scarcely know her."</p>
<p>"You'll get over that," she said reasonably. "She would have
been more like Victoria if there hadn't been any war." Then she
leaned down and patted his shoulder. "The best thing you can do
now is to go out and take a walk. You're beginning to look
sallow, and you can't bring back Victoria by neglecting your
health. Go out and get a breath of fresh air while I finish
putting these things away. Miss Agatha will help me, and by the
time you come in, I'll have everything straight."</p>
<p>Yes, everything would be straight, and the smallest sign that
Victoria had ever lived would be removed from his room. Already
that pale dust was sifting in through the half-open window,
through the cracks of the doors, and covering the past with the
immaterial refuse of time. After an inner struggle he rose to his
feet. "You are right, Louisa. I am not feeling exactly fit, and I
need a walk."</p>
<p>Still with that air of vague distress, he stood obediently
before her, while Louisa reflected tolerantly that you never know
how helpless men are until you see them at a funeral. After all,
there were so many things to be done in the house of mourning
without trying to prolong grief.</p>
<p>"I know I can't bring back Victoria by brooding. I may as well
go out for a walk. Have you seen Mary Victoria since she came in
from the cemetery?"</p>
<p>"No, I think she must have stopped downstairs with Duncan. I
always felt that he was the child Victoria loved best. He is
heartbroken over his loss--"</p>
<p>She had scarcely finished her words, when the door was flung
open, and Mary Victoria ran like a hurt child straight into her
father's arms. "Oh, Father, he has left me!" she cried in a
strangled voice. "He has left me forever!"</p>
<p>"There, there, my darling, my little daughter! What has
happened? How can I help you!" Her head was on his breast, and he
was holding her fast against disloyalty, against heartbreak,
against all the cruelties and tragic conflicts of life. And while
he held her there, he felt that his heart was turning slowly to
earth.</p>
<p>"I found a note in my room. He has gone. He will never come
back. Oh, he will never come back."</p>
<p>"Did he say that? Where is the note?"</p>
<p>"It is in my room. What does that matter? He said that he had
left me forever. He said that he would never come back. Oh,
Father, I cannot bear it if he leaves me! I cannot bear it if he
never comes back!"</p>
<p>"The scoundrel!" From a full heart the cry burst out, and he
added passionately to Louisa, "Such men ought to be drummed out
of the world."</p>
<p>"I tried so hard," Mary Victoria was sobbing. "I made every
sacrifice. I gave up every other interest. Oh, Father, I did
try!"</p>
<p>"You did, my darling. You have been an angel. You have been a
thousand times better than he deserved."</p>
<p>For the first time, Louisa interrupted, and her smooth
metallic tones cut directly through the stifling suspense in Mr.
Littlepage's mind. "I have never thought that he was quite right
in his head," she said quietly. "But maybe there is something we
don't understand. Did he say where he was going, Mary
Victoria?"</p>
<p>"No, he didn't tell me. He didn't wish me to know," wailed the
girl, lifting her head from her father's breast. "I've known for
weeks that he--he almost hated me--that he was thinking about
some other woman. Ever since we came home he has been different.
He would never have turned against me like this," she sobbed
despairingly, "if there were not some other woman."</p>
<p>Above the tumult of rage and pity in Mr. Littlepage's breast,
Martin's tormented face rose slowly before him, like the spectre
of a wasting moon over a whirlwind. Confronted by that
recollection, his anger died down, and he said soothingly, "I am
inclined to agree with Louisa, my child, and to believe that he
is distraught in his mind. When I talked to him a few hours
before your mother died, he seemed to be in a blind alley. I
advised him then to see Buchanan in the morning, and but for--for
what happened that night, I think we might have made him listen
to reason."</p>
<p>"I was wondering," Louisa remarked, with the composure that
somebody, she felt, was obliged to preserve in a crisis, "if he
could have meant more than he said. Wasn't he once before, when
he was in Paris, on the brink of--?"</p>
<p>Her question was never asked, for Mary Victoria broke into a
sobbing so wild and unrestrained that Louisa was frightened into
compassionate dumbness. Accustomed to the girl's arrogant
cheerfulness, she felt a pang of remorse, because she had
believed, especially since she had seen her in the presence of
death, that Mary Victoria was lacking in genuine emotion. As she
bent over her now and watched the long, convulsive sobs shudder
through her relaxed body, she thought, with a flash of
sympathetic understanding, "It must be her condition. Being that
way seems to upset women dreadfully."</p>
<p>"I couldn't bear to think that. Oh, Father, I couldn't bear to
think that," Mary Victoria moaned. "Help me to find him, Father.
I shall die unless you help me to find him!"</p>
<p>"If only I knew where to look, my child. Try to be calm. Try
to tell me all that you know. Why do you suspect that he has gone
to another woman?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Father." She stood up, wringing her hands in
anguish. "I don't know, but I must find him! Oh, won't you help
me to find him?"</p>
<p>"Try to be reasonable. Try to think of us, to think of your
child."</p>
<p>"I will, if only you will help me to find him. I must find him
before it is too late. I want him back. I don't care what he does
or what happens, I want him back. Oh, Father, won't you help
me?"</p>
<p>"Then tell me just what he said. Louisa, is there anything you
can give her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I don't want anything. All I want is to find Martin.
He said he was going away, and that I must not expect him to come
back."</p>
<p>"Was that all? Every word?"</p>
<p>"That was all. I thought he had gone to Milly Burden. I never
dreamed that he would--But--Oh, I see it all now. I see what he
meant. Aren't you coming, Father? Aren't you coming with me to
look for him?"</p>
<p>"I'll look, dear. I'll do the best I can." But, even while he
was speaking, the ugly thought had occurred to him, "Isn't death
the only solution? Is there any finality, except in death, for a
situation like this?" Horrified by that flitting shadow of evil,
he said with compunction, "If you will try to bear up, daughter,
I'll promise to do everything in my power."</p>
<p>"Then we must start," Mary Victoria said, with passionate
haste. "We mustn't lose a minute, if we hope to find him before
it is too late. Oh, Aunt Louisa, won't you give me my hat? I left
it somewhere in the hall."</p>
<p>"But you can't go, dear. You are not well enough. It might do
you harm."</p>
<p>"I can--I must." Reviving suddenly, Mary Victoria was animated
by flaming resolve. Light streamed back into her eyes; colour
flowed again beneath the leaden pallor of her skin. "I can. I
must," she repeated desperately. "Oh, Father, can't you
understand that I shall die if I have to sit and wait?"</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage looked helplessly at Louisa. "Ought she to go
with me? And where, anyway, are we going?"</p>
<p>Louisa, having found Mary Victoria's hat in the hall, was
trying to place it at the exact mournful angle on the girl's
head. "Wait a minute, dear, I must smooth your hair." Then, after
repairing Mary Victoria's injured appearance as well as she
could, she turned to confront Mr. Littlepage with her imperious
sagacity. "Of course she oughtn't to go, Virginius, but what are
you going to do about it? If she doesn't go with you, it will be
the first time in her life that she hasn't done what she wanted
to do." Then, with her watchful glance on Mary Victoria, who was
already hastening across the room, she added in a warning
whisper, "I suppose it is safer not to cross her."</p>
<p>"Couldn't you reason with her? She hasn't the slightest idea
where she is going."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, she has, Virginius, she is going to save Martin. As
soon as I made that unfortunate bent in the situation, it
provided her with her direction. She is going to save Martin from
his own nature, which is exactly what she has been doing since
she first met him."</p>
<p>Irritated by her sepulchral whisper, he replied almost
angrily, "All the same, you might try to reason with her."</p>
<p>Louisa shook her head. "You can't reason, Virginius, with
salvation. All you can do is to follow her in the hope that she
will never lose anything else that she wishes to keep."</p>
<p>He glanced at her in despair, but before he could summon an
indignant protest to his lips, Mary Victoria cried urgently from
the hall, "Oh, Father, won't you please hurry! This isn't any
time to stop and discuss things."</p>
<p>While he obeyed her, he asked sharply, "Have you any idea,
Mary Victoria, where you are going?"</p>
<p>"I am going to Milly Burden," she replied in a tone of
impatient anguish. "I am going to ask her if she knows where he
is."</p>
<p>Again he turned to Louisa. "Can't you stop her?" he pleaded,
with bitterness. "Women must not do things like that."</p>
<p>"If you were ever to stop her, Virginius," Louisa answered
sternly, "you ought to have started trying twenty-six years ago.
But I shouldn't let a theory of behaviour bother me," she added
consolingly. "Behaviour isn't nearly so important as it used to
be."</p>
<p>He flushed darkly. "Mary Victoria," he said sternly from the
threshold, "I refuse to allow my daughter to go to another woman
and ask for her husband."</p>
<p>Turning in her steps, for she had reached the head of the
staircase, Mary Victoria gazed back at him with incredulous eyes.
"I am obliged to find Martin, Father," she answered, with tragic
forbearance. "Nothing else on earth matters to me if only I am in
time to save Martin."</p>
<p>"Have you so little pride that you will go to another woman to
look for him?"</p>
<p>"You can't understand, Father," Mary Victoria reasoned, with
patience. "Pride has nothing to do with it. I must go to him
wherever he is. I must try to save him no matter what he has
done. If you would rather not go with me," she added in a
throbbing voice, "I will go by myself."</p>
<p>"God help us!" Mr. Littlepage exclaimed more in anger than in
supplication; and then, with one last moving appeal to Louisa, he
asked, "Will you tell me what I am to do?"</p>
<p>"I think," Louisa replied as gently as she could, "that the
best thing would be to order the car."</p>
<p>Mary Victoria, who had started down the stairs, turned to call
over her shoulder, "The car is waiting, Father. We can leave it
as soon as we reach Juniper Hill."</p>
<p>"You may as well start," Louisa remarked, as he flung a
helpless glance in her direction. "And I shouldn't worry a bit if
I were you about her going to see Milly Burden," she added,
following him to the staircase. "Nobody minds a thing like that
any longer."</p>
<p>To this she received, as she had expected, no audible reply;
but it seemed to her that Mr. Littlepage's shoulders were very
straight as he descended the stairs, and his pace had not
slackened a few minutes later, when, turning to a front window,
she watched him cross the pavement and step into the car. "He
hasn't been the same man since Victoria's death," she meditated
sadly. "Some men seem never to fall in love with their wives
until they have lost them and can fit them into a halo. By the
time he is through with Victoria," she added presently, with her
unfailing shrewdness, "nobody will be able to recognize a single
feature. Well, I suppose it makes him happier, and whether it
does or not, there isn't anything to be done about it."</p>
<p>As the car vanished in a haze of sunshine, her thoughts
passed, with astonishment, from Mr. Littlepage to Mary Victoria.
Yes, Virginius was right. This was the kind of thing that no
woman, at least no woman who was a Southern lady, could have done
in the last century. Never, not even if he had been her lawful
husband, not even to save him from his own nature, could Louisa
have run after a man. Even murder in a just cause, as long as it
did not involve a sacrifice of proper pride, would have been
easier for her. The women of her age had waited silently for what
they wanted, spinning their intricate webs with the eternal
patience of nature; and when what they wanted did not come
because he was caught elsewhere, they continued to wait and spin
as long as the gossamer threads held together. "I wonder which
way is best?" Louisa speculated, for hers was an inquiring mind.
"Is it better to cling to modesty until you lose everything else,
or to waste it like scattered rose-leaves in the long pursuit of
delight? But what is love, after all?" she asked suddenly, "and
who has ever found it by seeking?" On the pavement the faint
sunshine glittered and vanished and reassembled in a pattern of
silver. An old torment, the torment of hope and of long waiting,
shuddered back from her heart into her nerves. "I could never go
through it now," she thought, with a start of wonder because she
had ever survived it. "No woman of to-day could go through it and
live." Yes, she could not agree with Virginius that the world had
changed for the worse. Being a woman, she knew better. Being a
woman, she knew what she could never bring herself to tell him,
that the modesty of the past was a false, not a true, deity, and
delighted in sacrifice. No, it wasn't worth it, she said in a
strained whisper, as if someone were listening; it wasn't worth
it, at least to women. Nothing was worth all the deceit, all the
anguish, all the futile hope and ineffectual endeavour, all the
pretence and parade, all the artificial glamour and empty
posturing, of the great Victorian tradition. For an instant, so
relentless was the clutch of the past, her heart struggled like a
wild thing in the beak of an eagle. Yes, she knew, and Virginius
did not. She knew what it had meant to women. She had lived
through the ages of waiting, and she knew every throb, every
ache, every pang, every quiver. She had lived through it all. For
her heart had cracked and broken as quietly as the hearts of all
perfect Southern ladies broke beneath the enamelled surface of
beautiful behaviour. And now, cool, composed, indulgent,
self-contained, and easily amused, she watched with sympathy the
liberal manners of the new century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c308" id="c308">VIII</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving in what seemed to him an unnatural dream, Mr.
Littlepage left the car at the corner of Juniper Hill, and
followed Mary Victoria over the cobblestones to the opposite
pavement. Though he had reached the age when, according to all
the schools, man seeks comfort rather than adventure, he had been
shocked into self-reproach by the suddenness of Victoria's death,
and he was lingering now in that inhospitable region between
despair and resignation. Obstinately, in spite of Louisa's
sensible advice, he clung to his grief and remorse. Obstinately,
in spite of Mary Victoria's distress, he reminded himself that
the loss of Martin, even if he were lost forever, was a trifle
compared to the loss of Victoria. Yet he had observed, not
without resentment, that Mary Victoria, who had borne her
mother's death in deep affliction, but with quiet fortitude, had
shuddered into a tragic victim when this man, who was in every
way ignoble, had tried to abandon her. "You can't reason about
love," he thought indignantly. "It is love, or what they call
love, that makes most of the trouble in life."</p>
<p>Looking round as she walked, Mary Victoria sobbed under her
breath, "Oh, Father, promise me you will find him!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my child, we will find him," Mr. Littlepage
replied consolingly, and he added angrily to himself, "He isn't
worth losing."</p>
<p>A sigh floated back to him as Mary Victoria quickened her
pace. "But, Father, I want him!" And this sigh, so mournful, so
ardent, was inexpressibly moving. While she had lain sobbing in
his arms, Mr. Littlepage had felt that his heart was flooded with
tenderness. Now, however, following her in her eager pursuit, he
was conscious that his inner mood had chilled into compassion. If
only women had been satisfied to remain protected, how much
pleasanter the world, even this changing modern world, might be
to-day! If only they had been satisfied to wait in patience, not
to seek after happiness! For it seemed to him, while his mood, if
not his heart, froze into resentment, that there could be nothing
nobler in women than the beauty of long waiting and wifely
forbearance. He was old-fashioned, no doubt, notwithstanding his
advanced views in other fields than those of woman's sphere; but
surely it was not too much to insist that the true feminine
character had never flowered more perfectly than in the sheltered
garden of Southern tradition. Never had woman appeared more
desirable, never had she exerted a finer influence upon manners
and customs, than in those legendary periods when she had
disposed her limbs in the classic posture of waiting.</p>
<p>"Mary Victoria is going the wrong way about things," he mused
bitterly. "If only she could believe it, she would stand a much
better chance of getting what she wants if she would be content
to go back home and sit down."</p>
<p>At this point, his meditations were faintly ruffled by the
intrusion of poor Aunt Agatha and her attendant train of shadowy
figures, who had all, to judge from their subdued appearance,
waited somewhere with infinite patience. Well, of course, every
rule, however sound in principle, has its exceptions. Poor Aunt
Agatha was not only an exception, but, surveyed through this
disfiguring modern atmosphere, almost a catastrophe. To be sure,
she must have won whatever life had assigned to her by staying at
home; for even her fall, which happened so long ago that it had
receded to some dim island of allegory, had occurred, he reminded
himself, before the Southern lady had plucked even the most
immature apple from the forbidden tree. In his early youth, when
nymphomania was less literary than it is to-day, he had heard
elderly ladies, who were always interested and usually well
informed, whisper vague warnings against poor Aunt Agatha's moral
contagion. But, even then, he insisted to his harassed mind,
while he joined Mary Victoria's bold pursuit of the fleeing male,
Aunt Agatha had been sheltered, she had been protected. It would
become, he moralized, a deranged world indeed, if women should
begin to track down men in their wild happiness-hunting. Mary
Victoria, he knew, for all her reckless chase, was pursuing
Martin less for pleasure than from benevolence. She was animated
as always by a lofty purpose, not by a discredited instinct.
Before him, in the triumphant flesh, he realized, was a living
example of the steadfast dignity a sense of duty confers. If
women were ever to grasp this simple truth, what an endless
opportunity for destruction awaited them. Toying whimsically with
the idea, for there is safety in the whimsical that does not slip
into a tragic abyss, he thought with idle malice, "They may ruin
as many lives as they please, if only they will consent to ruin
them from the highest motives. . . ." His mind, overshadowed by
grief for Victoria, retreated suddenly into itself as into a
darkened chamber. Life again, the invincible Adversary! He was
alone with it there in that inner obscurity. Without light,
without longing, without joy, without hope, he was alone with it
forever. Even love could not save; for what did he, what did
anyone, know about love? Far away, as faint and thin as the music
of distant chimes, he heard the voice of Mrs. Dalrymple grieving
because love is not kindness.</p>
<p>"I must not let myself grow morbid," he thought. "I must not
begin to take a dark view of life. Louisa is right. That is a
poor way of showing respect for Victoria's memory." Lifting his
eyes from the pavement, he gazed up at the silvery blue of the
sky, where small white clouds were sailing in fleets. On the
still, soft air the sunshine quivered and paled; the winter
branches looked as insubstantial as mist; and over the sky and
the sunshine and the glimmering boughs there hovered the
impalpable film of a dream. "It is not real," he told himself,
with a start. He didn't know why, he didn't know how; but it was
not reality at which he was looking. It was not reality in which
he struggled and suffered like a bird in a net. "Perhaps I am too
complex," he thought. Or was he too simple-minded? Some day, when
he was old and his active life was over, he might begin to
explore the secret labyrinths of his own nature. He might even
try to discover why he had seemed to live like a pointed flame in
those instants of release--or was it communion? But not now--not
yet, not so long as the imperative needs of time and space still
enslaved his desires. Well, no matter. All he knew at the moment
was that he had been born out of his proper time, that he did not
fit into his age. He did not belong with poor Aunt Agatha, who
was too tender; he did not belong with Mrs. Dalrymple, who was
too brittle; he did not belong with Curle, who was too vulgar.
Yet, in the end, he speculated idly, Curle and his kind might be
the only ones to survive. In the end, they might wear out all the
softer and finer strains of human material. Was that the victory
toward which our civilization was moving so proudly? Well, no
matter. . . . This dull resentment against noise, against size,
against ugliness, might be nothing nobler than the approaching
rigidity of age, the slow hardening of arteries that had once
been as elastic as youth. It was his fault, perhaps, that
everything except his sorrow seemed trivial and meaningless.
Modern life especially appeared without dignity and even without
direction, an endless speeding to nowhere. Man, he told himself,
may have flown to the stars, and broken light and air to his
harness; but he was no nearer happiness than he had been in the
past. He was no nearer the everlasting answer to why? Whence?
Whither! . . . Even Curle, who never left off speeding and, as
Marmaduke once said of him, "could see the cheerful side of a
corpse," was not happy. No, Curle was not happy, his father
repeated cynically after a moment; he was merely full of noise
and rushing wind and the urgent impulse to live faster than
anyone else. With intense irritation, Mr. Littlepage recalled
that Curle, who had sincerely loved his mother, had translated
his grief into renewed speed and increased production. Straight
from the cemetery, he had rushed on in search of a monument; and
not until he had procured the costliest memorial that could be
crowded into the populous family plot, had he been satisfied to
turn back to his parades and his old cornfields. Well, no matter.
. . .</p>
<p>"Is this the house, Father?" asked Mary Victoria, as she
stopped before the sagging gate, under the dappled boughs of an
old sycamore which had escaped the political axe.</p>
<p>Beneath the tree, an Italian organ grinder was encouraging a
wistful monkey in a romantic burlesque; and while he doffed his
little cap and assumed the immemorial posture of chivalry, the
eyes of the wistful monkey asked, "Why? Whence? Whither?"</p>
<p>While he felt in the pocket of his waistcoat, and held out a
coin, Mr. Littlepage spoke a friendly word to the organ grinder,
who was playing a sad, gay melody.</p>
<p>"Did you bring him far?" he inquired, not merely to be kind,
but because he was interested for the first time since he had
entered the shadowy desert of sorrow.</p>
<p>"We came a long way, a long, long way, sir." The words attuned
themselves to the air, or was it, as Curle was fond of saying, to
the infinite?</p>
<p>"Do you treat him well? Why does he look so sad?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I treat him well, sir; but he is an artist. It is a hard
world for artists, sir, whether they be men or monkeys."</p>
<p>A hard world for artists! "Yes, we should keep to facts,
especially if we are monkeys. The world belongs to facts. Here is
one for you." Taking out his pocket-book, he selected a generous
note, and unfolded it slowly. As he gave it into the withered
little claws, the monkey doffed his cap again and replied with a
flourishing gesture. "He needs a new cap," Mr. Littlepage
said.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he has a new cap, but he likes the old one better
and won't give it up."</p>
<p>"Aren't you coming, Father?" Mary Victoria called impatiently
from the porch.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm coming, dear." As he opened the gate and went up the
walk of sunken flagstones, he glanced back over his shoulder, and
saw the wistful eyes of the monkey still following him. Why?
Whence? Whither?</p>
<p>"The idea of stopping, in the midst of our anxiety, to play
with a monkey," Mary Victoria remarked in the tone of a woman who
is exasperated, but still mistress of herself and her
surroundings.</p>
<p>"I wasn't playing, daughter. That monkey has something I have
always needed and never been able to find."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't choose this time to joke, Father." As she lost
her temper, she held the more firmly to her patience.</p>
<p>"My dear, I've never felt less like joking in my life, nor, I
feel sure, did that monkey. Don't you think I'd better go in
alone?"</p>
<p>"I must speak to her. But I've already rung twice, and nobody
has answered."</p>
<p>"Perhaps they are all out. Or Mrs. Burden may be putting on
her Sunday dress. If they keep a maid for the lodgers, she is
probably out walking with her young man."</p>
<p>Mary Victoria's only response was to ring for the third time
more emphatically. Then, after a long pause, she said with
annoyance, "You speak as if you hope they are out."</p>
<p>"I am not sure that I don't. Have you tried the door? In this
part of town doors are not often locked." Pushing her gently
aside, he turned the handle, and the door opened on the fine old
staircase in the darkened hall.</p>
<p>"They may think it strange if we go in," Mary Victoria
remarked, peering cautiously into the wan green light of the
house.</p>
<p>"Nothing is strange in this neighbourhood. Marmaduke will know
where they are. I'll run up and ask him. Are you able to
come?"</p>
<p>"I've never been up to his studio. How far is it?"</p>
<p>"Two flights, long and steep."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I am not equal to a climb like that. You
go up, and I'll sit on the porch and wait."</p>
<p>"You look pale, daughter. Are you sure you don't mind being
left?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't mind being left. I don't mind," she said, with a
strangled sob, "anything in the world." Then composing herself
with a gesture, she added, "But look inside first and see if
anybody is there."</p>
<p>Obediently, he glanced into the rooms until he came to the
kitchen, where he found a smouldering fire in the stove.
Returning, he said in a tone of relief, "Mrs. Burden is probably
visiting one of the neighbours, or she may be upstairs in
Marmaduke's studio. It isn't likely that she would leave her
house empty for more than a few minutes."</p>
<p>"Uncle Marmaduke may have left the door open."</p>
<p>"Well, he may have, but I doubt it. However, I'll go up and
ask. Would you like a glass of water?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want a glass of water. I don't want
anything."</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears, and she turned away from him to
the melancholy garden, where the leaves of autumn were still
lying in wind-drifts. With a pang in his heart, he told himself
that she was thinking of all the emptiness of the future, of all
the emptiness of other winters without a noble and engrossing
purpose in life.</p>
<p>"Shall I go up now?" Hesitating and irresolute, he felt that
in ascending that staircase and taking Marmaduke into his
confidence, he was beginning a search that must end in
disaster.</p>
<p>"Oh, go, go. Why don't you go?"</p>
<p>"I don't like to leave you, my dear. Somebody might come."</p>
<p>"What does it matter? What do I care?" Her nerves quivered in
her voice; and turning away, he went as quickly as he could into
the house and up the dark flight of stairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c309" id="c309">IX</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>When he reached the second floor, he could see the afternoon
sunshine streaming down from Marmaduke's studio; and mounting
rapidly, he found his brother still encircled by his depraved
riot of colour.</p>
<p>"I was going up to your house a little later, Virginius,"
Marmaduke said, as he balanced himself on his wooden leg and held
out his hand. "Few persons admired Victoria more than I did.
There was more in her, I believe, than she ever suspected. Her
convictions stood in her way, but convictions always stand in
your way, if they are strong enough."</p>
<p>"Everybody misses her," Virginius replied coldly, because he
could not bear to hear Marmaduke talk of Victoria. "But I came to
speak about Mary Victoria. Her husband has left her."</p>
<p>"Well, what did you expect?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what I expected, but not this. Mary Victoria is
broken-hearted."</p>
<p>"She doesn't know when she is well off. What excuse did he
give?"</p>
<p>"None. That's the worst of it. At first she thought there was
another woman. Now, she fears he may destroy himself."</p>
<p>"By another woman, do you mean Milly?"</p>
<p>"She means Milly. I don't mean anybody."</p>
<p>"What do you fear?"</p>
<p>"Well, I talked to him the evening I--we lost Victoria, and I
think the chances are that he has made away with himself."</p>
<p>"Poor devil!" Marmaduke said, with a sigh. "I suppose he's a
cad and a rotter; but all the same I have a lurking sympathy for
him in my heart. When you turn a man with a face like that loose
in a woman's world, you might more mercifully hang him."</p>
<p>"Haven't we always known that a man's face doesn't matter?"
Mr. Littlepage inquired, with asperity.</p>
<p>"No doubt. We've always known a good many things that are not
true. I tell you a chap like that, looking as if he had stepped
out of a sad legend, hasn't any better chance than a--than a
rabbit. Nor than a hare with the hounds after him."</p>
<p>This was, in Mr. Littlepage's opinion, an ignoble view of
life; but, within the last few days, ignoble views of life had
not seemed to him worth resenting. So he said merely, "He has one
of the best wives in the world."</p>
<p>"I can well believe it. The best wife sometimes smothers a
man."</p>
<p>"I remember he used that very word when he talked to me. He
even asked if I couldn't understand a man having had too much of
women?"</p>
<p>"You couldn't, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I told him I could. Any man, no matter how
happily he has been married, can understand that much of life.
But it didn't sound as if he were pursuing Milly again."</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't sound that way, but a man's protestation does
not always accord with his practice. He has been seeing Milly, I
know. I met him coming out of the house last night."</p>
<p>"Oh, you did!" Mr. Littlepage exclaimed blankly. "Well, I dare
say it was too much to expect him to be decent; but I did hope
Milly had come to her senses again. It looks," he prophesied
gloomily, "as if the whole world were going to ruin."</p>
<p>"We've been going that way for several million years, my dear
brother, and we haven't apparently got any nearer our
destination."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage frowned. His nerves, which had been on edge
ever since Victoria's death, slipped suddenly beyond the control
of his will. "I believe it's love that has gone rotten," he said,
while his lower lip protruded angrily and the purple flush
Victoria had dreaded mantled his face.</p>
<p>Marmaduke assented. "It wouldn't do any harm to try pity in
its place for a while. Pity is a finer sentiment than love, and
it might build a better world in the end than love ever
imagined."</p>
<p>But this frail philosophy only exasperated Virginius. "I am
too old to begin experimenting with either sentiment or
philanthropy. What I want to do is to save Mary Victoria and
Milly, if it is not too late."</p>
<p>Marmaduke's gaze roamed through the window, and beyond the old
sycamore, to the thin sunlight that was dissolving over the
river. "I believe Milly is saved already," he answered. "If to be
saved means to become something more than the helpless victim of
life. As for Mary Victoria, I am not sure that she can ever be
saved until she has first been destroyed."</p>
<p>A quiver ran through Mr. Littlepage's mottled features. "If
you have the heart to stand by and watch my daughter ruin her
life over an unworthy object, I haven't," he said bitterly.</p>
<p>"I confess I'd rather not watch it, Virginius. I am not
sufficiently pious to enjoy seeing people suffer. I don't even
enjoy seeing them go to prison, and I am sure I could never have
borne the sight of a burning. My heart, or at least my nerves,
are so unredeemed that I am not able even to justify the ways of
God to Martin. It seems to me a poor sort of Providence that
tracks down a wild creature with an automobile and slaughters it
with a machine gun."</p>
<p>"Do you think of Martin as a wild creature? He seems to me
nothing more dangerous than a flabby failure."</p>
<p>"He is a failure, I admit; but I still maintain that
Providence should be a sport even when tracking down failures.
That will, no doubt, impress you as impious. Perhaps it is. But I
cannot get over the feeling that the poor fool never had a chance
to be anything but some woman's purpose in life."</p>
<p>"Naturally," Virginius agreed more quietly, "you can't help
feeling sorry for him. But we must remember that he owed
everything, including his life, to Mary Victoria."</p>
<p>"That was where the trouble began. He owed her too much."</p>
<p>"She still loves him devotedly."</p>
<p>"You can't blame him for that. He did his best to destroy her
illusion. The truth is that she could have done twice as much
with him if she had loved him less and liked him more. Ever since
he was born, Martin has had too much love and too little
liking."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage sighed. After all, Marmaduke was speaking from
the shallows, not from the depths, of experience. "Sometimes a
man may have both," he rejoined uneasily; for he would have died
sooner than ask Marmaduke how much he knew, or imagined that he
knew about love. "Have you never seen them united?"</p>
<p>"Not often. I can recall only one woman who has been able to
give both in equal measure, and that is Louisa."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage started, and his unnatural colour faded slowly.
"But was Louisa really in love with you?"</p>
<p>So mocking was the flash in Marmaduke's glance that it
enlightened his brother even more quickly than the derisive note
in his voice. "Are you as blind, Virginius, as you pretend to
be?"</p>
<p>"Blind?" The word cut like a blade. "Do you mean to
imply--?"</p>
<p>"I imply nothing. Are you too wise or too dull to understand
why Louisa has remained single?"</p>
<p>"I am certainly too dull, if you mean--"</p>
<p>"Have you looked at her almost every day for thirty-odd years
and yet never seen what was as plain as--as--well, as the nose on
her face?"</p>
<p>"She has absolutely, if that is what you mean to suggest,"
Virginius faltered, "given me no reason to think that she
was--that she was--"</p>
<p>Marmaduke chuckled. "Good God, man, do you imagine I could
have stayed in love with Louisa for thirty years if she had not
been in love with somebody else? But she wouldn't have given you
any reason. Trust her for that. Louisa plays the game, even if
she is a Victorian virgin."</p>
<p>"She was always devoted to Victoria," Mr. Littlepage answered
resentfully. "She was Victoria's best friend."</p>
<p>"She probably loved Victoria better than she loved anyone in
the world. Louisa is the kind of woman with whom friendship runs
deeper than love. There were women like that born even in the
same year with Amy Dalrymple--or with Aunt Agatha."</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage was still justly incensed. "If you had not
lived abroad so long, Marmaduke, I should feel obliged to resent
your insinuations. It is little less than an insult, not only to
Louisa, but to Victoria."</p>
<p>"Louisa would not admit that. Even though she is a virgin and
unviolated, she has learned something since Babylon."</p>
<p>"I have the highest regard for Louisa," Mr. Littlepage
remarked stiffly, "the very highest regard and admiration."</p>
<p>"Well, so have I," Marmaduke sighed softly. "You must remember
that I have loved her almost as long and as hopelessly as she has
loved you."</p>
<p>In the deep despondency of Mr. Littlepage's mind there was a
sudden discreet flutter, as if a flock of startled birds were
settling to roost. "I refuse to admit that, Marmaduke. Such a
suggestion is an affront to Louisa's sterling character."</p>
<p>"My dear Virginius, there are circumstances in which a
sterling character is not only admirable but essential, and a
long and hopeless passion is one of them. Without a sterling
character, it is impossible to be hopeless and still love
on."</p>
<p>Out of the flutter and confusion in Mr. Littlepage's mind,
there emerged first a puzzled wonder and then the diffused light
of complete understanding. Surely to have inspired a passion,
however confined by virtue, in a sterling character, such as he
knew Louisa to be, was a higher tribute than the awakening of
wanton fancies in ladies of looser habits and softer natures.</p>
<p>"I must go down," he said abruptly. "Mary Victoria is waiting
for me." There was a new note in his voice, and before hastening
to the stairs, he paused an instant and looked with compassionate
eyes at his brother. Incredible as it appeared, he had never
realized before that Marmaduke was an old man. The years had not
mellowed him; they had merely driven and twisted him into this
mood of sardonic defiance. Standing there, in the last flare of
day, he looked, not only tough and seasoned and crippled, but
invulnerable alike to time and chance and desire.</p>
<p>"Well, good-bye, old chap," Virginius said softly, as he began
his long descent of the stairs.</p>
<p>When he passed the second turn a view of the open front door
and the outside world floated before him, and he saw that clouds
were gathering in the west, while a round red sun, spotted like a
tiger-lily, was drooping slowly into the river. As he approached
the door, the sound of muffled voices reached him, and one of
these voices he recognized, with a start of dismay, as Milly
Burden's.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am going away." There was a running cadence of ecstasy
in the words. "I am going away into the world!"</p>
<p>"I thought you might help me to find him," Mary Victoria
answered, as her father stepped out on the porch. Glancing
indifferently round when he laid his arm on her shoulder, she
added in a composed but suffering tone, "He is so ill that he
hardly knows what he is doing. I thought he might have come to
you."</p>
<p>"He did come," Milly said, with a strangely absent air, as if
she were listening to some faint music. "He did come, but he
didn't stay. He had to goon. Something was driving him."</p>
<p>"He didn't ask you, then, to--to--"</p>
<p>As Mary Victoria's voice wavered under her anguish, Milly
caught up the broken sentence, and finished it with an air of
defiant candour. "To go with him? No, he didn't ask me. He
thought he wanted me," she added, in what seemed to Mr.
Littlepage, in his anxiety, a less brazen tone, "but he
didn't--not really. What he really wanted was loneliness."</p>
<p>"Loneliness?" exclaimed Mary Victoria, and the echo was a sigh
of despair.</p>
<p>"Do you know where he went?" Mr. Littlepage demanded; and it
appeared to him, as he asked the question, that every
circumstance, even Milly's unhappy passion, had changed since he
entered the house and went upstairs to Marmaduke's studio. Even
the air had grown colder; a wind, with a sharpened edge, was
springing up from the river; and the heavy clouds were drifting
down over the red and black sunset.</p>
<p>"He didn't tell me," Milly answered slowly, "but he is going
as far away as he can. As long as his money holds out, he said,
he would go on. Maybe he will have to stop in France, but he was
hoping that he might get as far as the Himalayas. He wants to
find a place where there are high mountains and snows that never
melt and nothing else except loneliness."</p>
<p>A long shudder quivered through Mary Victoria's body, and over
her lowered head, Mr. Littlepage said sternly: "Well, it is a
good riddance--so long as he is going alone."</p>
<p>"Oh, he is going alone," Milly replied, with that quiver of
joy--or was it cruelty?--in her voice. While he looked at her in
anger, he told himself that he had never seen her so overflowing
with life. The blue of her eyes was deeper and richer, and the
April radiance shone in her smile and in the vivid bloom of her
lips. "She looks as if she were in love again," he thought
moodily, "but, in God's name, who is it this time?"</p>
<p>At her words, Mary Victoria had drawn away from her father's
arms, and she stood now, noble and proud and very lonely, against
the boughs of the old sycamore and the dark sunset. Broken but
undefeated, she put out her arm with a magnanimous gesture; and
looking into her face, Mr. Littlepage felt that the lost
adoration and romance were ebbing back into his heart. Once
again, his memory dissolved into a glowing mist and flowered anew
in the image of a little girl with auburn curls on her shoulders
and bare, sunburned knees above her white socks and black
slippers. "I want him to be happy," she was saying, in a tone of
exalted emotion. "If you can make him happier than I can, I am
ready--I am willing--"</p>
<p>For an instant, Milly stared at her with a flame of surprise
in her face. Then she answered quickly, almost fiercely, with a
hard little laugh (the laugh, Mr. Littlepage told himself, of
youth that is lost in its own selfish concerns), "But I don't
want him. I thought I wanted him until I saw him again, and then
I knew that I didn't. He doesn't want me, he wants loneliness.
And I--oh, what I want is something worth loving!" Catching her
breath, in that defiant laugh, she cried the words over again, as
if the very sound of them filled her with joy. "What I want is
something worth loving!"</p>
<p>"Well, I hope you'll find it, my dear," Mr. Littlepage said
coldly; for not only did he marvel at the curious appetite of
youth for disaster, but he disapproved of her unbridled desires
almost as much as he deplored her lack of feeling for Mary
Victoria. "But I doubt if you will, and even if you find it, you
probably won't know it. As for Martin," he concluded in a tone of
deep disgust, "we cannot lose him so easily. If we wait, he will
come back."</p>
<p>"When he finds loneliness," Milly replied indifferently, "he
may find also that it is not what he wanted. He may even find,"
she added, with the shrewdness of instinct, "that it isn't any
more satisfying than love."</p>
<p>Holding Mary Victoria in his arms, Mr. Littlepage felt that
all her gallant spirit, which had conquered Martin as well as the
Balkan kingdoms, was oozing slowly away. Her erect figure
appeared to shrink and falter beneath a burden that was too
intolerable to be borne. Even her voice, when she spoke, sounded
as if it were crushed by despair--or was it repugnance?</p>
<p>"It makes no difference now," she said, sinking back from her
supreme gesture of sacrifice; for what sacrifice, however noble,
can be confirmed when it is wasted? "No matter what happens, it
could never be the same thing again." A gust of pain, or perhaps
of anger, darkened her eyes, and Mr. Littlepage wondered
hopefully if she were at last seeing Martin, not in the glow of
her illusion, but by the chill dawn of Milly's awakening? "Are
you coming, father?" she asked, as she descended the steps to the
walk.</p>
<p>"In a minute, dear," he replied, and turned back to Milly. "So
it is all arranged, and you are happy?" Looking round nervously,
he saw that Mary Victoria was standing in the desolate garden,
with the withered leaves blowing about her feet.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is all arranged. Miss Goddard will look after mother.
She said Mrs. Littlepage asked her to do so."</p>
<p>"I know." That was like Victoria. She never forgot anything,
least of all a chance to do a kindness. "But the chief thing is
that you are happy."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am happy. Nobody who hasn't been as miserable as I was
last year could possibly be so happy as this."</p>
<p>"Just because you are going away?"</p>
<p>"Just because I am free. Just because I am free to begin
everything over again."</p>
<p>Everything over again! Oh, that insatiable appetite of youth
for disaster! "Well, you know now what life is."</p>
<p>She laughed with the old gay derision at circumstances. "But
the whole world is mine, and in the whole world there must be
something worth loving."</p>
<p>His face hardened. "Then you have not yet had enough? You are
still looking for love?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, and he felt that all the tragic splendour
of youth was in her face. "Not love," she answered, and her
voice, so rich, so vibrating, was like the sound of wings in the
air. "No, not love alone, but something worth loving!"</p>
<p>He smiled sadly. "Well, I hope you will find it, my dear, and
when you do find it, that it will be better than loneliness. If
it isn't, you know where a friend will be waiting as long as he
lives. But I shall see you tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you shall see me to-morrow. I am not going until the
end of the week."</p>
<p>With a last pressure, he dropped her hands and hurried down
into the garden. The wind was driving the leaves in flocks after
Mary Victoria, and it seemed to him, as he picked his way over
the broken flag-stones, that the advancing dusk was saturated
with the taint of despair. "If it is any comfort to you, my
child," he said when he had caught up with her, "you have every
reason to feel that he will come back in the end."</p>
<p>A sigh escaped her, and was lost in the melancholy rustle of
the wind in the grass. "Doesn't everything come back," she said,
"if you wait until you have stopped wanting it?"</p>
<p>Perhaps. He didn't know. He wasn't sure. Even in the practice
of law, he had avoided, as far as possible, the problem of
fugitive husbands. "Well, you must try not to lose courage," he
answered cheerfully. "After all, the important thing," he added,
with a vague idea that his words were an echo, "is to bring a
happy child into the world."</p>
<p>At this imperative summons to duty, her drooping shoulders
became straight again. "That is all I have left," she replied in
the familiar accents of noble determination. "Even though I have
lost love, I may still become a power for good in the life of my
child."</p>
<p>Touched in his most sensitive, if not his most rational, part,
Mr. Littlepage drew her hand through his arm and patted it
softly. Nothing, he meditated with a quizzical smile, could
temper the moral principle of Mary Victoria. "The best thing we
can do," he said gently, "is to go home and let Louisa look after
you."</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Louisa will know what I need," Mary Victoria
assented. "One of the last things mother said to me was that if
anything happened to her before my baby came, I must let Aunt
Louisa stand in her place. As if anyone could!" she added, with a
sob. "As if anyone could!"</p>
<p>Mr. Littlepage was still patting her hand. "You will find," he
said gently, "that Louisa is a rock to lean on in trouble."</p>
<p>Then he let her hand slip from his arm; and turning back for
an instant, his troubled gaze crossed the river and lingered on
the last faint gleam of red, which, even while he looked, was
smothered by the darkening drift of the twilight.</p>
