<h2>Chapter I. MIDSUMMER SNOW</h2>

<p>PATRICK BRENNAN, police patrolman, was the first to see the
beautiful woman of glass. Unfortunately, Patrolman Brennan did not
live long enough to report the incredible apparition. The policeman
died heroically in the discharge of duty.</p>

<p>The snow had been pelting down. It had started more than an hour
before the lovely, vivid woman was transformed into a horrible,
shadowy silhouette in the window of plate glass. The twin phenomena
of the snow and the ghastly shadow seemed to be wholly unrelated.</p>

<p>Patrolman Brennan might have told something of what really
happened, if he had survived. As it was, the policeman was left lying
in the street. His service revolver had belched death. It had taken
double toll of his attackers, but that had not been enough to save
him.</p>

<p>Snow is not unusual in Manhattan. Blizzardfalls, such as this one,
are rare, but they happen occasionally in proper time and season.
This snowfall was remarkable. It was being recorded by the United
States weather bureau as an all-time mark in freakish weather.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the first stinging particles whipped
the faces of the theater crowds on Broadway. Amazed voices intoned
unbelief.</p>

<p>"Can you imagine? A sleet storm! Of all things!"</p>

<p>These and kindred exclamations greeted the beginning of the
storm.</p>

<p>IN the offices of the government weather bureau was even more
amazement than elsewhere. A gray-haired, scholarly observer divided
his time between a window and his instruments. He frequently
consulted his various graphs.</p>

<p>"Look at that night map," he growled. "We are directly in the area
of high pressure extending a couple of hundred miles into the
Atlantic. So it couldn't be possible!"</p>

<p>"Sure, that's what the map says," boomed a deep voice. "But that
stuff on the window isn't taffy candy, mister. I felt it, and I
tasted it. It's snow. You'll have to make a new map."</p>

<p>The speaker was an authority on maps. For his name stood among the
ten or dozen most eminent engineers in the world. The man's fists
were approximately of the size of his head. And his head was of
leonine proportions.</p>

<p>He was Colonel John Renwick, known to the weather bureau
officials, and to thousands of others, as "Renny." His fame as an
engineer was perhaps somewhat less than his position of note as one
of the five adventuring companions of Clark Savage, Jr., better known
as the man of bronze, Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"You are correct," stated a smaller man, whose face was thin and
of an unhealthy pallor. "It is undoubtedly snow. Moreover, within a
short time there will be a violent thunderstorm."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!" promptly declared the grayish weather observer.
"How could there be a thunderstorm? Look! The nearest area of low
pressure is south of the Carolinas! So there couldn't be an
electrical storm."</p>

<p>The small, thin man shook his head.</p>

<p>"How could there be a snowstorm in midsummer?"</p>

<p>The thin man was Major Thomas J. Roberts, known as "Long Tom." He
was another of the companions of Doc Savage, an electrical
wizard.</p>

<p>This was the incredible part of the snowstorm. For it was
midsummer. To be exact, it was the midnight of July 4th. In a matter
of only minutes, it would be the morning of July 5th. So, as the
weather observer had insisted, "it couldn't be snowing."</p>

<p>The oldest resident of Manhattan had never witnessed such a
phenomenon. As long as there had been a weather bureau there had been
no such freakish occurrence.</p>

<p>"Look at this," directed the grayish weather observer. "All of the
Middle West is having the worst heat wave of the summer. Boston and
all the way to Portland, Maine, show high temperatures. Right now,
Washington and Philadelphia are in the eighties!"</p>

<p>WHILE unbelievable, almost fantastic weather history was being
recorded in the offices of the government, downtown streets rapidly
became deserted. Shortly after midnight but little traffic moved in
the vicinity of the shopping districts. The snow had not been deep
enough actually to block motor vehicles, but summer-clad residents
had faded from the streets.</p>

<p>The pale headlight beams of a small car penciled into a deserted
block near an elevated railway corner. The little car was a yellow
coup&eacute; of the "for rent" variety. The driver held to almost the
exact middle of the street. As the coup&eacute; turned into the
street, there was a loud, squishy blop! Air hissed for a few
seconds.</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed a tense voice. "I was afraid something would
happen!"</p>

<p>A front tire had blown out.</p>

<p>Street lights picked out the face of the driver. The face was
small, with features exquisitely formed. Large, luminous eyes
reflected the outside light. Slender white hands gripped the steering
wheel. These hands were inadequate to driving with a front tire
flat.</p>

<p>The small coup&eacute; coughed over to the curb. One side bedded
down where the snow had drifted some.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get out here and go on quickly," said another
woman, who was seated beside the driver. "I know we were followed
when we left the airport. We should have separated then."</p>

<p>The fear in the woman's voice was immediately confirmed. Two other
cars were turning into the block. Both were black, closed sedans. The
curtains of both cars were tightly drawn.</p>

<p>The slender young woman under the wheel slid from her position.
She pushed the door open against the storm.</p>

<p>"We'll go different ways!" she exclaimed, breathlessly. "I'll
endeavor to catch an elevated train! Then you can slip over to the
next street and take a taxi!"</p>

<p>The two closed cars, one trailing the other, were moving down upon
the coup&eacute;. The young woman who had spoken reached into the
little car and snatched a satchel purse of metallic chain mesh from
the seat. She slipped and floundered with her first steps, but she
gained the sidewalk and started running.</p>

<p>"You go the other way then!" she cried out to her companion. "Oh,
hurry! I'll get the message to Mr. Savage! I'll wait, if you do not
get there first!"</p>

<p>One of the two sedans swerved past the yellow coup&eacute;. Its
invisible driver pulled the car in again close to the young woman on
the sidewalk. She had caught up her light skirts and her trim legs
flashed with silk as she ran. The clinging snow was more than ankle
deep.</p>

<p>Four figures sprang from the sedan into the snowy street. These
were men of unusually upright stature, but they moved stiffly. Their
feet made dragging motions, as if their legs and bodies were impeded
by some heavy weight.</p>

<p>These men were between the young woman and the elevated stairs at
the corner. But they did not move as if they intended intercepting
her. When they sprang from the sedan, they took up a position near
the middle of the street.</p>

<p>The young woman's mouth was opened gaspingly. Her luminous eyes
widened with terror. She could see the faces of the four men in the
street.</p>

<p>"Oh! They've come!" she gasped. "I knew they'd come!"</p>

<p>THE faces of the four men were of the color of dull lead. Any one
observing them would have had the impression of corpses walking.
Perhaps the young woman imagined that, or it might have been
something more sinister, more appalling.</p>

<p>For a few yards, the four men merely kept pace with the fleeing
woman. The color in their faces was caused by masks. These were
fitted snugly over their noses and chins. They covered their necks
and appeared to be attached to the heavy material under their rough
outer clothing.</p>

<p>These men did not display any weapons openly. Two carried
peculiar-looking instruments. These could have been an iceman's
tongs, only they had handles several feet in length. The men paced
the woman with these strange devices over their shoulders.</p>

<p>The young woman was nearing the stairway to the "el."</p>

<p>Again she cried out, as if to reassure herself, "I'll get it to
Mr. Savage--"</p>

<p>The black sedan from which the four men had emerged scooted
suddenly ahead. The four men edged out into the street and made way
for it. The car speared in between them and the running woman.</p>

<p>The young woman then was in front of the plate-glass windows of a
store. This store handled musical instruments. Its double windows
were filled with the gleam of polished silver and brass. The plate
glass was fitted in from the level of the sidewalk. The woman's
shadow was reflected on it like a fleeing ghost.</p>

<p>The door of the sedan next to the sidewalk, popped open. A globe
twice the size of a football rolled out. This sphere had been
impelled sharply from inside of the car. The sedan door snapped shut.
The globe struck the sidewalk pavement in several inches of snow.</p>

<p>The snow did not impede the progress of the spherical object. For
where the globe touched, there was instantly no snow.</p>

<p>The fronts of buildings, the skeleton-like structure of the "el,"
the coup&eacute; and the other cars were abruptly bathed in a weird,
greenish light. The light was a warm glowing, yet it seemed to have
some substance. It was as if the air had suddenly been filled with
invisible particles.</p>

<p>THE second sedan had been pulled to the opposite side of the
street, some distance away. Two men sprang from this car, running as
they hit the street. These men were unmasked. Their white faces
looked drawn and desperate under visors of caps pulled low over their
eyes.</p>

<p>The two men swung automatic pistols of heavy caliber. They seemed
intent upon reaching the four men with the dull leaden masks. But
they did not shoot. The sedan from which they had come remained
standing.</p>

<p>The air was filled with a low, slow hissing. The rolling globe
lost the impetus it had been given. It was close to the young
woman.</p>

<p>The woman, then in front of one of the plate-glass windows, gave
forth a scream. The cry was high-pitched, almost animal in its utter
anguish. Only death could wring such an emanation from a human
throat.</p>

<p>There was another, lesser scream. It was like a minor echo of the
death wail. This came from the yellow coup&eacute; from which the
young woman had come. A slender figure, closely hooded and cloaked,
slipped from the little car. This was the other woman.</p>

<p>The glowing of the strange globe on the sidewalk was blinding in
its intensity. The two men armed with automatics skidded to a halt in
the snow. They cursed wildly and swabbed their coat sleeves across
their eyes.</p>

<p>The slim figure from the car crossed the sidewalk. It reached the
building front. The woman ran along the buildings, guiding herself
with one lightly touching hand. Arriving at a cross alley between
streets, she darted into it.</p>

<p>For a few more seconds the whole street was filled with the low,
slow hissing. The invisible particles seemed to fill the air with a
minor crackling. The fluorescent, greenish glow gave the snow an
unearthly aspect.</p>

<p>With the one soul-chilling scream, the young woman who was
attempting to reach the elevated, vanished from before the tall
plate-glass window. The space between this spot and the stairs of the
"el" was brightly illuminated. But the woman did not reach the steps
of the "el."</p>

<p>For a matter of seconds, it appeared she might have fallen in the
snow; that the fleecy downfall had buried her. But all around, the
snow was melting as if touched by sudden, fierce heat. And when the
pavement in front of the plate-glass windows was smooth and bare, the
woman was not there.</p>

<p>The four men in the masks of leaden color moved like automatons.
The pair with the long-handled tongs reached the sidewalk. Between
them, they trapped and nipped the globe that had come from the sedan.
With the tongs they swung it back into an opened door of the car.</p>

<p>All climbed in quickly. The sedan jumped away with a clashing of
gears. The driver did not appear to be an expert, but he was in a
hurry to leave. The car skidded around the corner, following the line
of "el" pillars.</p>

<p>PATRICK BRENNAN, the patrolman, was ringing in at a box in the
next cross avenue when the woman screamed. The patrolman's teeth had
been playing like castanets. His light, summer uniform had not been
made for a July blizzard.</p>

<p>Dropping the patrol box phone, Brennan whipped toward the
corner.</p>

<p>Blinding luminance shut off the policeman's vision as if a camera
shutter had clicked. He groped with one hand around the corner
building.</p>

<p>Patrolman Brennan first saw the outline of the yellow
coup&eacute;. He hard-heeled toward it. His feet were hitting bare
pavement. He clop-clopped over to the little car. His vision caught
the music store window. He stared for a moment, his lower jaw
dropping.</p>

<p>Beyond the coup&eacute;, the two men from the second sedan started
running. They held automatics. Both stumbled as if partly
blinded.</p>

<p>"Hold it, you two!" barked Patrolman Brennan. "What's this all
about? Stop, I say!"</p>

<p>This was a mistake on the part of the policeman. His voice
provided the two white-faced men with a target. Their hands whipped
up and the automatics erupted with a mean ripple.</p>

<p>Patrolman Brennan sagged, and he coughed. One hand on the side of
the coup&eacute; prevented him from collapsing. The erupting streams
from the automatics were all that guided his aim. Though his big body
was slowly sinking, Patrolman Brennan's hand was steady.</p>

<p>Three jumps of the service revolver and both running men rolled
into the snow. One lay still. The body of the other jerked. Patrolman
Brennan was now on his knees. He was unable to rise, so he crawled.
He clawed his way into the street, making toward the halted, second
sedan.</p>

<p>The driver of this car ignored the bodies in the street. The sedan
moved away mockingly. Patrolman Brennan lifted his revolver. His
finger curled around the trigger. But his strength left him.</p>

<p>Scarlet fluid trickled from the policeman's lips. It stained the
snow in a circle around his head.</p>

<p>The yellow coup&eacute; stood alone and empty. All life had gone
from the block. The three bodies were only dark lumps. These were
whitening with the still-falling snow.</p>

<p>In the space where the young woman had been before the plate-glass
window of the music store was a blackened area. The pavement looked
as if a searing iron had been run over it.</p>

<p>The young woman's body could not be seen.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk in front of the music store was a queer little
collection of objects.</p>

<p>Directly before the plate-glass window lay a satchel purse of
metallic chain mesh. The purse had flopped open. A small caliber
automatic pistol, such as a woman might have carried for protection,
had slipped out.</p>

<p>A dozen bright metal buttons lay in a glittering cluster. From
these emanated the greenish glow which still lingered over the
street.</p>

<p>A diamond ring had rolled to the edge of the curb. An expensive
wrist watch and earrings set with emeralds were close to the window
of the music store.</p>

<p>Of the lovely figure which the jewelry had adorned, there was no
slightest trace.</p>

<h2>Chapter II. "CORPUS DELICTI" IN GLASS</h2>

<p>CORDED bronze hands moved deftly among a variety of gleaming
instruments affixed to a panel of black marble. The tiny lights set
in the panel were reflected in flaky, golden eyes. The specks of
light moved in the bronze man's orbs as if they had been caught in
small whirlwinds.</p>

<p>Doc Savage's bronze skin over his corded neck merged with the
smooth mask of similarly tinged hair. He was so motionless in
concentration that his head gave the effect of being that of a carved
statue.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt but what the snowstorm of itself is isolated
and purely local in the New York area," stated the bronze man. "But
there are indications possibly of other distant spots similarly
affected. She said there might be sudden weather changes."</p>

<p>The bronze man's words were more musing tone, rather than a
statement to the three companions then with him. For nearly an hour,
he had been studying the freakish July snowstorm. With the radio and
other instruments, he had been checking many widely separated areas
of the world.</p>

<p>The scientific equipment in the eighty-sixth floor headquarters of
the noted adventurer was advanced in its design. With but a touch,
Doc Savage could contact almost any latitude.</p>

<p>"Johnny," who never used a short word where a longer one would
serve, was busy with the radio.</p>

<p>"This barometric phenomenon is indubitably a solaric manifestation
beyond the scope of casual elucidation," observed the scholarly
geologist and archeologist of Doc Savage's adventurous group.</p>

<p>"That would be sun spots to you, Monk, if even such simple words
come within range of simian understanding," grinned "Ham," flicking
some dust from the sleeve of a suit that was the latest in summer
fashions.</p>

<p>"Monk's" broad body nearly filled one opened window. His figure
was almost as wide as it was long. He turned and his small eyes
snapped with fire under his grizzled brows. Hair the color of rust
stuck out like clipped wires around his ears and on his neck. His
hands were covered with it. It looked like shaggy fur.</p>

<p>Monk's body shook with indignation. One furry hand scooped snow
from the window ledge.</p>

<p>"In less than a minute, one crackpot shyster will be in the market
for a new suit of dude clothes!" he squealed.</p>

<p>For Ham--Brigadier General Theodore Marley Brooks--one of the most
astute lawyers ever graduated from Harvard, and Monk--Lieutenant
Colonel Andrew Blodgett Mayfair, famous chemist--considered any day
misspent without the exchange of caustic insult.</p>

<p>Johnny continued his observations on the weather. The keen,
scholarly geologist was tall and bony to the point of emaciation. As
William Harper Littlejohn, he had occupied one of the highest chairs
of learning in a leading university. He spoke in one-syllable words
only when he was excited or the going got rough.</p>

<p>"She said there would be sudden weather changes," Doc Savage
repeated, glancing at the barometric reading on the black marble
board.</p>

<p>Though the repeated statement was cryptic, none of his three
companions questioned its meaning. The bronze man would explain in
due time.</p>

<p>Just now, the blizzard, or snowy tempest, was at its height. Snow
swirled around Monk in the opened window. The impressive skyscraper,
with its tower thrusting into the sky, seemed to sway and rock in
gusty blasts.</p>

<p>THE telephone buzzed. Doc Savage swung over to the instrument.
Johnny instantly made contact with an extension. It was a device of
Dr. Savage's which would allow an instantaneous check-back on the
number calling.</p>

<p>But this was Renny calling from the office of the government
weather bureau. He had been sent with Long Tom by the bronze man to
keep an added check on the freakish storm. Doc Savage did not usually
concern himself with such matters as weather, but, before the
beginning of the snowstorm, he had been given reason to overlook no
detail that might be of value.</p>

<p>"There will be a violent electrical disturbance," announced Doc,
ending his conversation with Renny. "It is Long Tom's prediction. The
weather officials dispute it, but it coincides with my own
observations."</p>

<p>The bronze man took two yellow slips from the table. They were
telegraph messages. Doc studied them intently, as if he were reading
something written between the lines.</p>

<p>One telegram had been filed in Los Angeles. This read:</p>

<p>DEATH THREATENS MANY PERSONS STOP DISASTER MAY MENACE WHOLE WORLD
STOP WILL YOU HELP US STOP ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU</p>

<p>SATHYRA FOTHERAN</p>

<p>The other message had been filed in Chicago only ten hours later.
This stated:</p>

<p>HAVE LEARNED YOU ARE IN GRAVE DANGER STOP BEWARE VISITORS WITH
DARK SKINS STOP MUST GO TO SYRIA IN THE DESERT STOP BE ON GUARD UNTIL
I REACH YOU STOP WATCH CHANGE IN WEATHER CLOSELY</p>

<p>SATHYRA FOTHERAN</p>

<p>"Sathyra Fotheran," said Doc aloud. "That would be Lady Sathyra
Fotheran, the sister of Denton Cartheris."</p>

<p>Johnny eyed the telegrams intently. A quick gleam of interest
showed in his keen eyes.</p>

<p>"Lady Fotheran?" he said. "She could be no other, with that
peculiar cognomen. She is the sister of the revelationist of
pre-dynastic mortuary disembodiment of the ultra-civilization of the
vanished Hittites." Then he added in crude, concise English, "How I
envied that guy, Denton Cartheris. Wasn't there some question about
his death, Doc, or whether he had really died?"</p>

<p>"Denton Cartheris disappeared during a new trip of exploration
after his discoveries in the ancient Hittite capital," stated Doc.
"But information received by his friends indicated he believed he was
going to die and had made preparations for his demise."</p>

<p>Lightning suddenly stabbed across the open window. Its vividness
was that of a gigantic, slashing sword. Thunder cracked instantly
with an explosion that shook the skyscraper tower.</p>

<p>"And she said to watch for a change in the weather," mused Doc.
"Recent reports show unprecedented storms in upper Syria. The River
Euphrates has been twenty-three feet above all previous high-water
records."</p>

<p>"Blast it!" exploded Monk. "How could that be possible? We're to
believe this dame knew in Chicago this afternoon the weather was due
to go on a bust here tonight?"</p>

<p>"That's how it would seem," stated Doc. "At any moment, we may be
hearing more directly from Lady Fotheran."</p>

<p>The bronze man was not evincing occult insight. He was merely
estimating the flying time between Chicago and New York. The phone
buzzed again. Johnny swung to the extension. A woman's strained,
tense voice greeted Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"Mr. Savage? I'm trying to reach you--"</p>

<p>The woman was spilling words, as if she might have only a few left
to use.</p>

<p>"I'm being followed--can't tell you more--I'm--"</p>

<p>"Where are you?" demanded Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"Thirty-third Street, near the--"</p>

<p>The words ran into a choked gurgle. The instrument bubbled with
the woman's strangled pain. Two slapping blows came like the breaking
of dry sticks. In the bronze man's ear was only the low hum of an
open wire. The receiver at the other end had not been replaced. Doc
was convinced the cord had been suddenly ripped loose.</p>

<p>"Have you got the trace-back?" said Doc quickly.</p>

<p>"Public booth," announced Johnny, giving an address only a few
blocks away.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Johnny," directed Doc. "Be prepared, for you may have
a visitor. Watch out for any one with an Asiatic complexion. Monk and
Ham will come with me."</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE was passing through the outer door before he had
finished speaking. He did not pause to arm himself, because he never
carried a gun. His men were equipped with the superfirers of his
invention, which were in reality, convenient automatic machine guns
loaded with mercy bullets.</p>

<p>Doc's special high-speed elevator dropped with the force of a
leaden plummet nearly all of the eighty-six floors.</p>

<p>From the elevator the three men whipped into Doc's concealed
basement garage. The roadster in which they emerged on the street
within less than a minute after the woman had been snatched from the
telephone, looked like any ordinary car.</p>

<p>But bullets would only drum upon its armor metal or flatten on the
bulletproof glass.</p>

<p>With Monk at the wheel, Doc instructed, "Take no chances. This may
be something much bigger than we can guess."</p>

<p>Monk was a skillful driver. The car, with its powerful supermotor,
grazed the steel of the elevated railway columns. Monk seemed able to
estimate to the fraction of an inch how much room he could allow. The
steel brushed the bronze man's clothes at times.</p>

<p>Monk turned off the avenue along which ran the elevated. He was
swinging around the block to reach the address of the public phone
booth traced by Johnny. This street was almost empty. There was only
a small yellow coup&eacute; standing by one pavement. Its nose was
bogged down, as if it had been wrecked.</p>

<p>Apparently, the woman's call had been made at about the time
Patrolman Brennan had died in the snow. The bodies had remained
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Monk braked the roadster down. "Howlin' calamities!" he squealed.
"Them humps of snow are bodies!"</p>

<p>BUT Doc Savage was off the running board before the car came to a
stop. His quick hands brushed the snow from the uniform of Patrolman
Brennan. The policeman lay as he had been crawling, toward the
companions of the men who had shot him.</p>

<p>The bronze man saw the position of the other two dead men. He
observed the automatics still gripped in their hands.</p>

<p>"A brave copper," murmured Doc. "And--a couple of Whitey Jano's
rats."</p>

<p>Monk and Ham had followed him.</p>

<p>"These two men are Creeper Hogan and Slim Decarro," announced Doc.
"They are two of Whitey Jano's killers. I didn't know Whitey Jano
used gunmen for ordinary jobs."</p>

<p>"The cop got 'em," said Monk. "Walked right into it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the bronze man, "and after they shot him."</p>

<p>He did not explain how he knew this. He was already on his way
toward the yellow coup&eacute;. For perhaps two seconds, he remained
looking at the little car.</p>

<p>Apparently from nowhere came a low trilling sound. It might have
been the throaty whistle of some tropical bird. A wind through wires
could have made somewhat the same sound. Doc's lips were unmoving but
the vibrant emanation came from him. It was his sign of unusual
concentration.</p>

<p>Monk and Ham were beside him. Doc moved slowly along the sidewalk
in the direction of the elevated railway stairs.</p>

<p>"This snow," he said, moving a foot in the thin film, "has been
here only a few minutes. The first snow is gone, yet there is no
heated basement under this pavement."</p>

<p>The wide area in front of a music store had been blackened. The
seared section of the street showed plainly through the later
snow.</p>

<p>Now thunder cracked and rolled. Lightning played with lurid
lashing over the tops of cloud-scraping buildings. Between these
flashes, the building fronts took on a greenish glow.</p>

<p>Doc halted in front of one window of the music store. Brushing
aside the new fall of snow, he picked up a woman's chain-mesh purse.
His fingers touched the cold metal of a small automatic pistol.</p>

<p>He held the purse and the pistol in his hands.</p>

<p>"The initials are S. F.," he stated, pointing to the silvered
lettering on the side of the purse. He flicked one of several cards
from a case inside the purse.</p>

<p>"Lady Sathyra Fotheran," he read aloud.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" howled Monk. "Y' mean them alley buzzards got the
lady? Lookit, Doc!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage already had seen what now brought a long gasp from
Monk. Monk was scooping up a pair of earrings and a costly wrist
watch.</p>

<p>"Must have stripped the woman of her jewelry and then dropped it
when the cop started pluggin' at them," observed Ham. "Here's one of
her rings."</p>

<p>He had discovered the diamond ring glittering in the snow near the
curb.</p>

<p>"I think not," stated the Man of Bronze. "Notice the peculiar
light. It's in the snow. It's stronger in the diamond than anywhere
else."</p>

<p>The fluorescent glow still lingered over the street. The scene was
almost like that of a brilliantly painted stage. It was as if a
strong phosphorescent substance, perhaps a special sulphide of zinc,
had been spread over everything.</p>

<p>Again the trilling sound filled the space around them. Only in a
moment of greatest stress did this emanate from Doc. And the man of
bronze was standing motionless. His eyes had followed the focusing
point of the strange glow in the street.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squawked Monk. "Danged if I believe what I'm
seem'! Ham, do you see it? There in the window?"</p>

<p>"You are seeing it, Monk," stated Doc. "Rather you are seeing
her."</p>

<p>AN "el" train had rumbled to a stop. Several persons came down the
stairway. Police sirens wailed from two directions. The first squad
car hooted into the block and the driver picked out Doc's group in
front of the music store as a point to stop.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Carnahan was red-faced and choleric. Followed
by four men, he sprang out in the snow. A minute later, he was
bellowing orders.</p>

<p>"Ring in the block! It's Slim Decarro and Creeper Hogan of that
cursed Jano gang! They got one of the boys! There's been a mob rubout
here! Hiya--so you're here, Savage? What brought you into this, or is
this just one of them funny accidents?"</p>

<p>The red-faced inspector confronted the Man of Bronze.</p>

<p>"It wasn't any accident," said Doc, calmly.</p>

<p>"Then what do you know about this?" demanded Carnahan. "Who was
them Jano killers out to get? An' how did it happen they left them
rats in the street? I thought we had this rubout stuff about cleaned
up."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a mob feud, inspector," said the bronze man quietly.
"It was the murder of a woman."</p>

<p>"A woman! What woman?" barked Carnahan. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Right there," pointed Doc. "In the glass of that window."</p>

<p>"In the glass--a murdered woman--sa-ay! You must've been eatin'
nuts this time for sure!" howled the inspector, the blood boiling his
face to the color of a beet. "Whadda you think--well, for Pete's
sake! O'Malley, Connors, come here!"</p>

<p>Detectives O'Malley and Connors made dry, clucking noises in their
throats. Their eyes bugged and they edged closer.</p>

<p>"By all the saints!" gasped one. "It's nothin' but a picture!"</p>

<p>It might indeed have been only a picture. If so, it was most
extraordinary shadowgraphing. In the thick plate glass, a woman
appeared to be walking. The form was more of a silhouette, black in
color. It lacked the highlights of a photograph.</p>

<p>But it was life-size, as if the woman's body had been flattened
and merged with the glass. One slim arm was extended upward, in the
position of warding off a blow or some threatened danger.</p>

<p>Inspector Carnahan rubbed his hand dubiously over the glass. The
surface was smooth, unmarred.</p>

<p>"Get that door open!" he rapped out. "Bust the lock or smash the
window, but get in! We'll see about this nutty stuff! Savage, you
stick around! I'll wanta talk to you!"</p>

<p>Carnahan seemed to be one of New York's few detective inspectors
with lack of wholesome respect for Doc Savage's reputation. It
happened this was the choleric Mr. Carnahan's first contact with the
man of bronze.</p>

<p>When the lock was pried loose and Carnahan himself had crawled
into the display window, the inspector discovered he had not
progressed in the least. The inside of the plate glass was as smooth
as the outside.</p>

<p>"But sure, an' there's a woman there, an' she ain't never been in
that window before," asserted Detective O'Malley. "I was in the shop
only yesterday afternoon, buyin' my boy a mouth harp. An' the glass
was as clean as a hound's tooth!"</p>

<p>Inspector Carnahan was far from pacified. He again confronted Doc
Savage.</p>

<p>"That loony picture in the window don't mean a thing, Savage. Now
why do you think a woman was bumped off? Where is this woman? Where
is the corpus delicti?"</p>

<p>"You'll never need to seek farther than this window, inspector,"
the man of bronze declared, solemnly. "In that glass, as plain as
you'll ever see, is your corpus delicti."</p>

<h2>Chapter III. MEN OF DARK FACES</h2>

<p>THE skin of Inspector Carnahan's face resembled a blown-up toy
balloon, inflated to the bursting point.</p>

<p>"O'Malley! Connors!" he barked. "You keep guard on that crazy
window while I get some more men! An' I'm puttin' out the alarm for
Whitey Jano! I thought that mug had dropped this strong-arm stuff an'
got himself into the upper tiers!"</p>

<p>Inspector Carnahan meant by that it was his belief "Whitey" Jano
had become a crook of a little higher order. His record showed he had
been brought in twice, charged with forms of extortion that savored
of a shrewd confidence game. And Whitey Jano had moved from a hangout
on the lower East Side to a luxurious penthouse in the vicinity of
Central Park.</p>

<p>While Inspector Carnahan was concentrating his puzzled attention
on the window of the murder shadow, Doc Savage had unobtrusively
slipped into the small yellow coup&eacute;. He was careful not to
disturb the cushions of the wide single seat.</p>

<p>From a small vial taken from an inner pocket, the bronze man
sprinkled a grayish chemical powder. This covered the seat from side
to side. Almost instantly, the plush of the cushions took on a
curious yellow glow. This was the nap of the thick plush slowly
coming back to place after having been compressed.</p>

<p>This informed Doc that two persons had occupied the small car. A
small inside plate told him the coup&eacute; was a rented car.
Checking on the owner, the man of bronze swung back to the
street.</p>

<p>Crossing the street, Doc followed the curb to the corner by the
"el." He returned slowly along the curb in front of the music store.
Now he knew there had been two cars, besides the coup&eacute;, on the
scene at the time of the woman's murder.</p>

<p>Monk and Ham were still giving their attention to the window of
the shadow. Doc slipped between them.</p>

<p>"Stick here," he directed. "Don't let anything happen to that
glass. The police are not likely to find anything except the bodies
in the street. Stay here until the deputy medical examiner decides
what to do about the picture."</p>

<p>DOC'S movement away from the small crowd now collected around the
window was unobserved by Inspector Carnahan. The bronze man glided
into the nearest alleyway. His immediate goal was the public phone
booth from which the frantic voice of a woman had called. He knew the
call must have been almost coincident with the shootings and the
murder.</p>

<p>Just before he emerged into the adjoining street, Doc halted
abruptly in the darkness of the alley. Directly across the street was
the black mouth of the continuing alley. Across this gloomy space,
some lighter shadows had suddenly passed.</p>

<p>There were several figures. They could have been ghosts, judging
from the noiselessness of their movement and their color. The figures
seemed to be clothed in white sheets. Doc glimpsed the red tail-light
of a car farther in the alley.</p>

<p>From the vicinity of the car in the alley came the crash of
splintering glass. Half a dozen of the sheet-clad figures had
surrounded the automobile. A slender woman was pulled out and thrust
against an alley wall. What might have been a knife of huge size,
flashed in a glittering arc.</p>

<p>"You black devil!" shouted a heavy voice. "I'll burn you
for--"</p>

<p>The huge knife gave off a sudden glinting light. The mouthing of
the other man ended in a wild scream of pain. Then the man yelled,
"Grab the black devil! Grab 'im, Curt! He's chopped off my hand!"</p>

<p>Doc traversed the short length of the alley with the speed and
silence of a jungle cat. Four men had spilled from the car from which
the woman had been pulled over to the wall. There was light enough to
glint on their guns.</p>

<p>The man who had screamed now had slumped to the running board of
the car. At his feet a machine gun had thumped to the bricks. The man
was holding up the bleeding stump of his arm. His right hand had been
neatly amputated above the wrist. Apparently, he had been trying to
use the machine gun.</p>

<p>Before Doc could decide where he was most needed, or why, another
man from the car gurgled and rolled to his back. This man's heels
flapped on the ground. He acted as if he had been partly broken in
two. Doc saw this was literally true.</p>

<p>A long knife had slitted across the man's stomach. The blade had
been deeply buried and ripped the rest of the way across. The man
with the huge swinging blade had aimed it at the neck of another man,
who was desperately attempting to get an automatic into action.</p>

<p>Doc arrived with the effect of a silently bursting storm. One
cabled bronze hand flashed out with the speed of light. The tall
figure wielding the blade somersaulted over Doc's shoulder. His
weapon clanged on the alley bricks.</p>

<p>The bronze man's head suddenly took the square impact of a blow.
The crashing collision with the base of his skull temporarily
paralyzed his active senses. He exerted his will to remain on his
feet.</p>

<p>For perhaps a half minute, the man of bronze was what is commonly
known as "out on his feet." By exercising his amazing force of will
over nerves and muscles, he might have continued active. But the
bloody fight apparently was over.</p>

<p>TWO white men, wearing all the marks of hoodlums, were pulling one
dead man back into the car. The man with the amputated hand had
wrapped his wound with a half of his own shirt. The dark-skinned
"sheeted" men had slightly withdrawn. The tall figure Doc had hurled
over his shoulder had retrieved his hefty, murderous blade.</p>

<p>This man apparently was the leader. He cried out in a gobbling
foreign tongue.</p>

<p>"Thishahum, bism er rassoul!"</p>

<p>The language was the Arabic of the desert Bedouins. From tribe to
tribe in the vast burning spaces of lower Asia the tongue varied but
little. The extensive, all-embracing knowledge of Doc Savage included
nearly all of the spoken language. He identified the speech
instantly.</p>

<p>The tall man's cry had been, "Kill, in the name of the
prophet!"</p>

<p>A sudden voice spoke more calmly. It was in Arabic, but Doc
interpreted the meaning:</p>

<p>"It is enough!"</p>

<p>The quiet tone carried authority.</p>

<p>Doc remained immobile. All of this and all of his observations
transpired within the flashing passage of perhaps thirty or forty
seconds. But the man of bronze had trained himself to record and
segregate the smallest details.</p>

<p>The tall leader of these dark-skinned men was not a true Bedouin.
All of the white men's attackers wore the garb of the desert. Their
flowing abbas were long cloaks of camel's hair, dyed. These dropped
from their shoulders to their heels.</p>

<p>Their kafiehs were snowy-white headcloths that draped over their
shoulders.</p>

<p>But the tall leader's abba was heavily embroidered with gold
thread. Doc knew that in Syria this would have indicated the man to
be the favorite slave of a sheik of sheiks. Such slaves were much
more than ordinary. Sometimes they were warriors of fierce
repute.</p>

<p>The great knife that had slashed off the white man's hand was a
glittering, curved scimitar. A silver scabbard swung at the man's
belt. The scimitar had a brightly jeweled handle.</p>

<p>Though the brief battle had resulted in one dead man and one
seriously crippled, the engagement had been almost soundless. The
total elapsed time from when Doc entered the alley until the
automobile was moving away, was probably less than two minutes.</p>

<p>Now Doc Savage sought for the motive of the encounter. Clearly
enough, the white men in the car had been of the hoodlum brand. It
had been a strange, mysterious battle.</p>

<p>There was the woman. Doc remained motionless. The woman's white
face was like a dim flower in the alley darkness. Another figure was
standing beside her. The leader of the Bedouins growled a guttural
command. The Bedouins moved swiftly, silently. Their long abbas gave
them the effect of gliding along the alley. They faded away as
soundlessly as a small company of ghosts.</p>

<p>The man of bronze permitted them to go. He might now have come off
well enough in an encounter against even the Arabs with their knives.
But another purpose had sprung up instantly. The woman had been left
behind with that other shadowy figure.</p>

<p>Doc emerged from beside the wall.</p>

<p>"You are the one who summoned me by telephone," the bronze man
stated. "Then you were seized and brought here. Some of this is
mysterious. I would take it those Bedouins I have permitted to depart
are your friends."</p>

<p>DOC'S generator flashlight flicked into his hand. Its ray was
spread. The woman outlined in the brilliant white blaze was beautiful
in statuesque fashion, only she was not tall of stature.</p>

<p>She had poised dignity. Her face was drained of blood, and it was
pale almost to the point of seeming transparency. Her skin was of the
texture of lovely velvet. Eyes of a deep golden hue, not unlike those
of Doc Savage, widened upon him.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Savage, the Doc Savage," she said as a statement and
not an inquiry. "None could ever make a mistake, seeing you. Yes, I
am the one who telephoned. You arrived just in time."</p>

<p>"You say you telephoned, then you were seized," the bronze man
said. "So the Bedouins were your friends," he repeated.</p>

<p>"As to that, I cannot say," was the woman's surprising reply. "It
is the first time I have ever seen a Bedouin or an Arab. I mean, of
course, directly from the desert in native costume. I know as little
about all this happening just now, as you. I was seized by the men in
the car."</p>

<p>A man stood beside the woman. Thus far, he had said nothing. His
face was long and incredibly thin. It looked unhealthy.</p>

<p>The man has suffered with tropical fevers, was Doc's instant
judgment. He has lived in the jungles, or, perhaps, the desert.</p>

<p>"And you?" Doc pointed the two words at this man.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the sallow-faced man. "I happened along. I was
following the Bedouins. I have been in Syria and the men were unusual
in their native clothes in New York. Then I saw familiar faces."</p>

<p>"Now," suggested Doc, "neither of you has identified
yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," came instantly from the golden-eyed woman. "I
just took it for granted that you would know. I am Sathyra Fotheran,
of course. You got my telegram?"</p>

<p>Doc Savage, for the moment, said nothing in reply to the woman's
statement. His flaky gold eyes caught the keen gray orbs of the
sallow-faced man. They impelled an answer to an unspoken
question.</p>

<p>"And I am Carson Dernall," stated the man in his dry, crackling
voice. "It is a remarkable coincidence that I should be here. I was
an aide to Denton Cartheris, in Syria, before he died. This is only
the second time I have met Lady Fotheran. The first time was when I
bore the news of her brother's death. I had no idea what an amazing
result would come of my following those Bedouins."</p>

<p>"It is a remarkable coincidence," stated Doc Savage, without
display of emotion. "When I received the call from Lady Fotheran, I
came immediately; but I did not come at once into the street from
which she telephoned. There was a slight delay."</p>

<p>The man of bronze thumbed several small white cards into his hand.
They bore a name in distinctive engraving. He spread them under the
ray of the flashlight.</p>

<p>"Then these, I take it, would be your property, Lady Fotheran?"
Doc said.</p>

<p>FOR the first time, the woman displayed visible emotion. Her
golden eyes widened. The slender fingers with which she just touched
the engraved cards were exquisitely kept.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, yes!" she breathed. "They are mine! Oh, then you've
found Marian? She picked up my purse by mistake. We were trying to
get to your headquarters, Mr. Savage. We discovered we were being
followed."</p>

<p>"You separated when you left the yellow coup&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! That was it! We decided to try and reach you by
separate ways! Marian is my secretary. She was taking the elevated
train. Then she did reach your office? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"What happened when you left the coup&eacute;?" parried the man of
bronze.</p>

<p>"Why--well, there was a strange, blinding light. For a little
while, I could not see. Oh, Mr. Savage, I have much to tell you
concerning that--something I have known and--"</p>

<p>"Later, Lady Fotheran," interrupted Doc. "What more happened by
the coup&eacute;?"</p>

<p>"That is about all I can remember. There were two other cars near
by, and some men walking just before the light came. There were four
men I saw. They had dull, gray faces. Or maybe they were more the
color of lead."</p>

<p>"They interfered with your secretary?"</p>

<p>"No! No! I could not see for the sudden blindness of the light! I
think Marian ascended the steps of the elevated, but I could not be
sure. So I ran, and I used the first telephone I could find!"</p>

<p>"We will go to my headquarters," announced Doc. "It will be best
for us to go over into the other street and call a taxicab."</p>

<p>"Then Marian is there?"</p>

<p>"It is better we go there," Doc stated, gravely. "I fear your
secretary will not come."</p>

<p>"Oh! You mean she has been made a prisoner? She was taken
away?"</p>

<p>"She has been taken away," was all Doc vouchsafed.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall touched shoulders with Doc, as they moved into the
adjoining street.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I know something of this and I can be of assistance
perhaps," Dernall remarked in a low tone.</p>

<p>HOURS later, the police were in possession of a severed human
hand. It had belonged to "Runt" Davis. The hand had been found in the
alley.</p>

<p>Runt Davis was known as the first lieutenant to Whitey Jano,
before Jano had apparently dropped his strong-arm activities to
become a slick confidence man on his own.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. WINDOW ATTACK</h2>

<p>DESPITE the freakish snow and the early morning hour, a crowd of
loiterers had gathered in the block. The augmented police guard kept
the crowd of the curious from the sidewalk. Six brawny policemen did
sentry duty beside the "murder picture" itself.</p>

<p>Among the loiterers weaved a thin-shanked, narrow-faced youth. His
eyes were beady and predatory. He moved with a shambling, furtive
gait, pausing here and there to mop the back of a dirty hand over his
twisted mouth.</p>

<p>The thunderstorm was beginning to break with greater fury. Lances
of lightning stabbed at the gleaming faces of skyscrapers. The snow
was changing to rain. The temperature of the crazy July night was
rising.</p>

<p>The thin-shanked youth kept his cap pulled low over his ratty
face. One hand was held thrust inside his flapping coat. He edged in
among the loiterers directly in front of the "murder picture"
window.</p>

<p>Aronson, proprietor of the music store, was arguing with Inspector
Carnahan.</p>

<p>"You can't keep the cops on my store, when it comes time for
business," complained the fat music man.</p>

<p>"I can keep cops on this joint until the moon turns as green as
that nutty light on everything around here!" said Inspector
Carnahan.</p>

<p>Following Doc's instructions, Monk and Ham remained at their
posts. They had been told to watch that window. Rain started
pattering down. Streams began trickling over Ham's summer sartorial
elegance. The lawyer moved under a narrow awning. A pleased grin
spread over Monk's homely face.</p>

<p>"If you'd take to wearin' clothes like a man, instead of one of
them Fifth Avenue dudes, you wouldn't be mindin' a little wettin',"
said Monk.</p>

<p>"An' if I had a suit of monkey fur and your mug to push around
with it, I'd go back to the jungle and quit wearing any clothes,"
replied Ham, with a tone of elaborate insult. "Besides, I've
thought--"</p>

<p>Ham's pleasing observation was never finished.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" squeaked Monk. "Look out!"</p>

<p>The apelike chemist heaved his squat body sidewise and upward. A
heavy missile was flying through the air. It was a hammer with a
blunt round head and weighing several pounds. The hammer was shooting
straight toward the picture of the murdered woman in the plate
glass.</p>

<p>Monk tried to catch the hammer. His effort failed. The weighty
missile flew onward. Heavy glass splintered and shivered in razorlike
strips to the pavement.</p>

<p>"C'mon!" Monk exploded. "Doc'll want to give that guy the
once-over! We'll get him!"</p>

<p>THE furtive youth who had been holding his hand under his coat was
getting away with the speed of a weasel.</p>

<p>The murder shadow of the woman had escaped destruction. While Monk
had failed in his attempt to catch the thrown hammer, his hand had
deflected its course. The weighty iron had smashed through the plate
glass of the window next to that in which the woman was pictured.</p>

<p>The hammer-throwing weasel put on a burst of speed. Sticking to the
alley, he crossed three streets. He entered the alley again in the
fourth block away from the music store.</p>

<p>Alongside a wall of smooth brick in the mouth of the alley at the
fourth street, stood a black, closed sedan. It had been parked well
to one side. Apparently this had been the goal of the hammer hurler.
He made straight for the parked sedan.</p>

<p>Ham and Monk rounded the wall after him, made for the car.</p>

<p>"Thishahum, bism er rassoul!" grated a voice.</p>

<p>Like Doc, his men knew many of the world's languages. Ham flashed
around defensively, his back to the wall.</p>

<p>"The Bedouin cry of the raid," he muttered to Monk.</p>

<p>"'Kill, in the name of the prophet.'"</p>

<p>A huge, hawk-nosed figure was leaping upon them from the sedan.
The man's giant form was cloaked in a gold-embroidered abba. A curved
scimitar like a razor-edged crescent whipped in a circle over the
man's head. Under the headcloth, his flowing kafieh, the attacker's
face was of the smoothness and color of ebony. There was the flat,
dilating nose of the Nubian.</p>

<p>Monk and Ham were given no time for observing details. Behind the
Nubian leader came half a dozen figures with flowing abbas and
kafiehs. But their faces were of the color of dull lead. In the gloom
of the alley, these seemed to be real faces. The masks continued into
tightly-fitting neck pieces that extended beneath the shootlike
undergarments, their gumbaz.</p>

<p>Monk whipped away from the wall. From a concealed pocket, he
produced two small glass capsules. He waded into the mass of figures,
his huge feet crushing the tiny glass globules.</p>

<p>Ham had seen his intention. He did not breathe. He knew the effect
of the capsules.</p>

<p>These contained a powerful anaesthetic gas, effective instantly.
In a minute it would be cleared away; but in that minute, those who
breathed it went to sleep.</p>

<p>The hawk-nosed Nubian suddenly waved his scimitar and its jeweled
handle flashed. Then the massive weapon fell from his hands. The
black face became vacuous. The ebony man's eyes closed and he lay
down in the dirty snow. His gold-embroidered abba was sogged with the
slush.</p>

<p>None of the masked figures seemed affected by the gas, however.
Monk howled angrily. The big chemist flailed at the nearest men with
his fists. Ham was at his side.</p>

<p>But the odds were too great; they were overpowered.</p>

<p>Securely held by the cloth wrappings, Monk and Ham were still
conscious when they were carried to the sedan. Monk had only the lame
satisfaction of seeing the giant Nubian also carried to the car. He
had been the only one knocked out by the gas.</p>

<h2>Chapter V. AN ANCIENT WARNING</h2>

<p>RENNY and Long Tom shot upward in the high-speed elevator. They
ascended to the eighty-sixth floor headquarters of Doc Savage with
somewhat the manner of a released rocket.</p>

<p>Only in the last few yards of its upward flight did the bounding
car slow.</p>

<p>Lightning crackled across the windows at the end of the skyscraper
corridor. Thunder rumbled and shook the vast mass of metal and
stone.</p>

<p>Long Tom grinned appreciatively. He had remained at the offices of
the weather bureau long enough to see his prophecy of an electrical
storm fulfilled.</p>

<p>As Renny started toward Doc Savage's door, the lightning ripped
brilliantly. The instant clap of thunder told the bolt had come
close. The lights in the building flicked out. Renny and Long Tom
were in darkness.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" bellowed Renny. "Call off your thunderstorm! When
you've made good, what's the use in overdoing it?"</p>

<p>Long Tom chuckled.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to make it quite so tough," he remarked, dryly.
"Seriously, I'd give something to know what's causing all this."</p>

<p>He was slightly behind Renny. The engineer's big hand gripped his
shoulder. The electrician winced. Renny never seemed to realize the
strength in his bone-crushing hands. Perhaps that was why his
favorite pastime was smashing tough door panels with his fists.</p>

<p>"Stay back!" thundered Renny. "Look! What do you suppose that
is?"</p>

<p>The sudden Stygian gloom of the corridor had lightened. The
luminance was of a strange quality. The light was vividly blue. It
seemed to be composed of invisible particles.</p>

<p>Renny and Long Tom halted. They stared at the origin of the eerie
illumination. This appeared to be a spot directly in front of Doc
Savage's door. Renny started to advance.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute; I wouldn't touch it," advised Long Tom. "You never
can be sure what funny contrivance some one might be trying to wish
onto Doc."</p>

<p>The building electrician had found the fuses burned out by the
lightning. The corridor around Renny and Long Tom flooded suddenly
with light. The strange blue glow remained, but it was dimmed.</p>

<p>"Huh, after all, it's only a funny stone," grunted Renny. "Looks
like it might have been painted."</p>

<p>"I'd be careful," warned Long Tom. "Might be an explosive, or
maybe some acid."</p>

<p>Renny seldom heeded warnings. The giant engineer often blundered
into trouble. Usually his huge fists mowed a way out. He picked up
the curious flat stone. Nothing happened, except the blue glow was
spread over Renny's wide hands and along his arms.</p>

<p>Renny turned the stone over. It was worn and pitted, as if it had
lain for a long time exposed to the weather. Centuries had added up
to thousands of years since the flat stone had been cut into its
present form.</p>

<p>"Looks like an ancient," Renny said. "You can see where it's
pitted. Might have been ground with sand."</p>

<p>THE pair pushed through Doc's door. Johnny's attenuated bundle of
bones reared in the doorway leading to the library and laboratory.
Johnny had observed the approach of Renny and Long Tom before the
lights went out. He was wondering what had delayed their
entrance.</p>

<p>"Got a puzzle for that erudite brain of yours," said Renny.
"Perhaps you can make something out of this. It's had something cut
into it, but the figures look like some kid's first lesson in
geometry."</p>

<p>He placed the stone on the laboratory table. The scholarly Johnny
picked it up. He placed a thick-lensed monocle in his eye. This
affectation of Johnny's was really a powerful magnifying glass.</p>

<p>The stone was covered by rows of uneven characters. These had the
appearance of having been inscribed with some sharp tool, but the
carving had been smoothed by generations of time.</p>

<p>Johnny's knowledge of archaeology equaled that of the leading
scholars. Only the man of bronze himself had studied the subject more
deeply. Johnny plucked half a dozen long words from his extensive
vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Luminance polarized indefinitely upon an opaque infragible
substance," he pronounced, reflectively. "The characters are of the
ancient Himyarite symbolism. They have been definitely affected by
long exposure to the vagaries of atmospheric changes."</p>

<p>"Sure," grunted Renny. "That's what I thought. But in a few words
of one syllable, does it mean anything?"</p>

<p>Johnny was studying the worn symbols intently.</p>

<p>"Humph!" he emitted. "Unless I'm on the wrong key, this is a
direct, if peculiar, warning."</p>

<p>When Johnny thus descended to simple verbiage, it denoted he was
either strongly impressed or somewhat excited.</p>

<p>"The characters are clear enough, and they were inscribed on this
stone perhaps as long as five or six thousand years ago," he added.
"The stone undoubtedly came from the desert in the vicinity of the
River Euphrates. It's Himyarite, without doubt."</p>

<p>"What do they mean, if you know?" questioned Renny. "How could
those crazy figures carved thousands of years ago be a warning."</p>

<p>Johnny squinted more intently through his monocle.</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can explain," he stated, "the lines read, 'Concern
thyself with thine own business if thou would continue to live.' I
might have missed a word or two, but it sums up to the same
thing."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "In plain English then, it means stay
out of somebody's business or take a chance on getting bumped
off?"</p>

<p>"An elemental interpretation, but one hundred per cent perfect,"
nodded Johnny. "This stone is an original Himyarite brought from the
Arabian desert. It is intended as a warning to Doc, and I'll venture
it is connected with those telegrams."</p>

<p>"I had been expecting something of that character," spoke the
quiet but penetrating voice of Doc Savage from the doorway.
"Brothers, this is Lady Sathyra Fotheran, the sister of Denton
Cartheris; and Carson Dernall, until recently the explorer's aide in
Syria."</p>

<p>They had just arrived from the alleyway where Doc had found Lady
Sathyra.</p>

<p>SEEN in the bright lights of the laboratory, the face of Lady
Fotheran was even more beautiful. Her wide golden eyes seemed to
reflect the luminance.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall's thin countenance looked more sallow and
unhealthy. The gray eyes, however, were alert in a cold way. He
exclaimed, as he took in the multitude of scientific devices in the
bronze man's laboratory.</p>

<p>"I had imagined the stories of your investigations were slightly
exaggerated, Mr. Savage," said Dernall, slowly. "But I must apologize
for having had such a thought. I have never had the good fortune to
see such a complete--what is this?"</p>

<p>In the midst of his fulsome words, Carson Dernall paused for the
abrupt question. His cold gray eyes were fixed on the flat stone
which Johnny had replaced on the table.</p>

<p>"Ancient Himyarite, Mr. Dernall," said Johnny. "From the Syrian
desert, I would say."</p>

<p>Without touching the stone, Carson Dernall leaned closer.</p>

<p>"You understand the symbolism?" said Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course," admitted Carson Dernall. "I would interpret
it to mean 'keep out of our business if you want to live.'"</p>

<p>Johnny's keen eyes flickered.</p>

<p>"Approximately, we agree," he stated. "The carvings are subject to
various expression in English."</p>

<p>Dernall touched the stone with the tips of his long fingers. The
fingers were of unusual length. They gave the impression of writhing,
as they moved.</p>

<p>"This is indeed strange, Mr. Savage. How did the stone come
here?"</p>

<p>"Some fellow who didn't want to hang around left it as a calling
card at the door," explained Renny.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall's thin face became a grave mask.</p>

<p>"Left at the door? Mr. Savage, knowing what I do of the desert, I
fear that stone means great danger to you! It undoubtedly was brought
all the way across the world for a definite purpose."</p>

<p>The little whirlpool stirred in the flaky gold eyes of the bronze
man. Though he had not appeared to do so, he had read and instantly
put his own interpretation on the symbols of the Himyarite stone. Doc
did not reply directly to Carson Dernall's statement.</p>

<p>"You said you identified some of the Bedu you encountered on the
street?" said the man of bronze.</p>

<p>Apparently, he was ignoring the flat stone. The strange blue glow
remained, as if the stone itself were alive with hidden fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" replied Carson Dernall. "Naturally, I was attracted
when I saw some Bedouins cloaked in the abbas. Rather a peculiar
costume for the streets of New York. I managed to get close to them
as they were entering a car. Then I followed in a taxicab."</p>

<p>"The Arabs came from a car and ran into the alley where I was
being held by those other men," said Lady Fotheran. "Mr. Dernall
followed them."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" agreed Dernall. "Among those Bedouins was the man I
knew in Syria as a slave. He was called Hadith. I recalled that in
Syria, where we were digging when Denton--"</p>

<p>Dernall caught himself. Lady Fotheran's golden eyes were deep with
sudden, inner pain.</p>

<p>"This Hadith, as you might have noted from his embroidered abba,
had been a first slave to a sheik. That gave him a reputation as a
warrior. He was a ruthless leader in ghrazzu, the great game of the
Bedouins in raiding other tribesmen and robbing them. Hadith was
reported to have disappeared."</p>

<p>"I recognized the leader with the scimitar as a Nubian of the
slave order," stated Doc Savage.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" said Dernall quickly. "And this Hadith was reported
among the Bedu as having vast evil powers. We were told a legend in
Alleppo, even before we entered the lower country of Syria. A
dried-up old man, a Kurd, swore by Allah it was true."</p>

<p>"And what was this legend?" inquired the man of bronze.</p>

<p>"SIMPLY one of the fantasies of the Syrian hills, I'd say. But the
old Kurd declared the ancestors of Hadith, the Nubian, were of a
mystic sect. The Kurd asserted they possessed the power to convert
their enemies into motionless shadows on the desert."</p>

<p>Doc Savage quietly picked up the glowing blue stone, inspecting it
as if absorbed in thoughts unrelated to Dernall's fabulous
statement.</p>

<p>"Denton and myself looked upon this as one of the many wild fables
of the Bedu of the hills," said Dernall. "But it was a part of the
legend that violent changes of weather accompanied the conversion of
men and horses into shadows. It is all incredible! But this snow and
the storm tonight, together with the appearance of the Bedu, was very
upsetting. Of course, the fable of the shadows is a myth."</p>

<p>Peal after peal of thunder filled the rooms of Doc Savage's
headquarters. The tall skyscraper reverberated and trembled with the
smash of the electrical elements. It was as if the storm was
cannonading in mockery at Carson Dernall's doubt of the desert
fable.</p>

<p>Johnny's quiet voice was heard.</p>

<p>"Of course, such a story could only be a fable," he commented.</p>

<p>The well-modulated, calm voice of Lady Fotheran observed.</p>

<p>"But it is no fable; it is all true," she said, surprisingly. "The
weather is only a part of it. There are shadows on the desert--the
shadows of men, or what had been men. And that's why I am here, Mr.
Savage. My brother, Ranyon, believes only you can solve this terrible
mystery."</p>

<p>"Ranyon would be your younger brother," said Doc Savage. "I knew
he was in the desert. I had some interest in perhaps learning of what
he might discover."</p>

<p>If Lady Fotheran was amazed at the bronze man's knowledge, she did
not betray it.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Ranyon is following the directions in the will
left by Denton. It is a strange will, Mr. Savage. With it was a
parchment writing, it directed my younger brother to form a caravan
at Wejh. He was to choose only Harb and Juheina tribesmen, as being
all that were trust-worthy."</p>

<p>"You had confirmation of your brother Denton's death?" said Doc
Savage.</p>

<p>"Only his will, which we received," said Lady Fotheran. "It was
brought from the desert by a band of tribesmen. They came to Wejh.
Ranyon was then directed to seek a place of hitherto unknown diggings
into an ancient city in the lower hills near the River Euphrates. The
place, known as the Tasus Valley, was mapped. The spot Ranyon is
seeking was marked with care."</p>

<p>"This will of your brother's," said Doc Savage. "It possibly
indicated some treasure might be found?"</p>

<p>"No, and that is the strangest part of it. Its message, after
leaving Denton's small estate to Ranyon and myself, was 'you must
seek this place for the good of humanity'!"</p>

<p>"A strange will indeed," commented the man of bronze.</p>

<p>"And Ranyon was instructed to take advice only from one man called
Mahal, an ancient Bedawi, on where to go and how to proceed."</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran hesitated. An inscrutable light came into her wide
golden eyes.</p>

<p>"There are shadows on the desert," she said, repeating her earlier
assertion this story was not a fable. "I am desperately afraid for my
brother. Perhaps, even now, I am too late. I have no doubt but that
death threatens any one who may become interested in this place of
the Tasus Valley. I, too, have been warned."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" gasped Renny.</p>

<p>The eyes of Johnny and Long Tom jumped with surprise.</p>

<p>LADY FOTHERAN had reached into the bosom of her dress. Now in her
hand lay a stone. It was a flat stone, glowing with blue,
phosphorescent fire.</p>

<p>"I received this just before I sent my first telegram from Los
Angeles," announced Lady Fotheran. "I could not, of course, decipher
the ancient inscription; but it seems much like the other stone."</p>

<p>Johnny peered closely through his magnifying monocle.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" he exclaimed. "The warning is
indubiously identical!"</p>

<p>"Then I had this letter from my brother Ranyon," said Lady
Fotheran, extracting it from her hand bag. "In it he tells of a
violent rainstorm, strange to the desert, coming up. It was
accompanied by terrific thunderings and lightning flashes. Then a
ball of fire appeared over the tents of his camp and descended with a
terrific explosion. The tents were burned. The following day, on a
rock outcrop near his camp, he saw imprinted the shadows of mounted
horsemen. On the desert floor below were rifles, knives, saddle
trappings and bridle bits scattered about."</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran unfolded the letter and read aloud the concluding
passage: "I am proceeding with Mahal, a faithful old Bedouin, who has
advised me, to the place known as Tasus Valley. You must seek Doc
Savage. I have learned danger threatens you. The welfare of a hidden
city is at stake. Sudden weather changes may precede the peril. I am
going on. I have a strange feeling that Denton is alive. Perhaps I am
wrong. This may only be caused by my overwrought imagination. This
former slave, the Nubian, Hadith, may have gone to America."</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran's perfect hands fluttered to her face. Her golden
eyes questioned the man of bronze.</p>

<p>"Now that you have heard," she said, evenly, "do you still tell me
that Marian, my secretary, has been taken away?"</p>

<p>"She is beyond further danger," advised Doc Savage. "It is of your
own peril you must think now. Have you had the feeling your older
brother is not dead?"</p>

<p>"I never have believed he was dead," the calm woman announced. "I
had hoped Ranyon would find him. Now I am greatly worried. Ranyon
would never turn back. Unless he is stopped, or this murder mirage is
solved, he is going to his own death."</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. His corded tendons flexed in his wrist
and the mighty column of his neck. One bronze hand lifted the blue
stone of the Himyarite warning. The glowing color seemed to intrigue
the giant adventurer.</p>

<p>"This is all too incredible to be believed!" crackled the voice of
Carson Dernall. "There must be some logical explanation."</p>

<p>"If there is, it will be found," announced Doc Savage.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI. ANALYZING THE STONE</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE'S bronze hands slid the glowing blue Himyarite stone of
warning into a flat, shallow-edged pan. With his sleeves rolled back,
the giant of bronze compelled admiration in the golden eyes of Lady
Fotheran.</p>

<p>Doc's arms were incredibly thewed. Cords lay like bundles of taut
wire under the smooth skin. As he worked there was a constant play
and rippling of the muscles.</p>

<p>Doc tried chemicals from several jars. One of these was a powder
of sulphide of calcium. To this, Doc added two varieties of mineral
salts.</p>

<p>The blue glow of the Himyarite stone turned slowly to purple. Then
the stone became vividly red. It was of the color of running blood.
The laboratory lights were reflected deep in its surface.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran and Carson Dernall partly arose from their chairs.
They glanced quickly around. Doc Savage was gazing intently at the
luridly red stone. His face was a bronze mask. His firm lips were
immobile.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran and Dernall had been startled by a sudden musical
trilling. Yet it was not a tune. The erotic sound might have come
from the full throat of a rare bird hidden deep in the bush. It
touched the notes of the scale, but without harmonious order.</p>

<p>Doc's three companions knew their bronze chief had made some vital
discovery. Perhaps it would be in the chemical analysis of the
ancient stone. Or it might have been the answer to some other angle
of the problem of the murder mirage.</p>

<p>Doc's men did not expect to learn what had been ascertained. The
man of bronze had almost unconsciously emitted the rare trilling. He
would tell nothing until his theory had been wholly confirmed. If he
has guessed wrong, perhaps they would never learn.</p>

<p>WITHOUT a word, Doc whipped out of the laboratory. He picked up
the telephone in the outer room. When he had his number--that of the
commissioner of police--he spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Is the store window of the murdered woman being closely
guarded?"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Doc Savage?" came the commissioner's voice. "Well,
yes. I've just doubled the number of men over there. What do you know
about all of this, Doc? They tell me you reached the place ahead of
my men."</p>

<p>"I know very little," Doc replied. "But I would suggest your men
pick up every person who looks like he might be an Arabian. I can't
tell you more now. Two of my men are watching the murder window
and--"</p>

<p>"That's what you think," interrupted the commissioner. "They were
watching the window until an attempt was made to smash it. Now the
fellows you call Ham and Monk have disappeared."</p>

<p>Doc's voice did not betray his surprise. "What happened,
commissioner?"</p>

<p>"They chased after the youth who attempted the window smashing,
cornered him in an alley and were attacked by some gang. Then they
were taken away in a sedan."</p>

<p>"Have you arrested any one, as yet?" Doc inquired.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but we've got a straight lead. It's the Whitey Jano boys
we're looking for. Two of them were rubbed out the first time that
hellish green glow showed up. Then we've got the hand of Runt Davis,
Jano's right-hand man. Only Runt won't be much of a right hand for
anybody, now."</p>

<p>"Where did that come from?" said Doc, though he was well aware
where it had been found.</p>

<p>"Runt seems to have gotten careless with a chopper in an alley,
and then he forgot to take his hand with him," said the commissioner.
"As soon as we get a line on Jano, we'll start breaking the thing.
Jano's apparently moved out of that penthouse of his. But we'll have
him before the day's over."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the information," said Doc. "Remember about the Arabs,
commissioner. They may or may not be wearing native clothes. If you
happen to pick up one, I'd appreciate some conversation with
him."</p>

<p>"Arab, you said?" The commissioner growled. "Now that may mean
something. We found a dead foreigner with his throat slit in Whitey
Jano's penthouse. Inspector Carnahan reported he believed him to be a
Turk or an Armenian. I'll look into that."</p>

<p>DOC replaced the instrument and stood for a moment thinking
deeply. The mysterious murders were becoming the most involved of any
into which he had ever been projected.</p>

<p>The dead man in Whitey Jano's penthouse was added proof of a
killing feud between the mobsters and the Bedouins. Apparently the
Jano crowd had been on the scenes of all the crimes. It seemed hardly
credible that Whitey Jano had suddenly taken on the role of a public
protector.</p>

<p>Nor was it acceptable as a theory that the Bedouins, unfamiliar
with New York, had set about wiping out the Jano mob.</p>

<p>Doc Savage got another number. This time, his speech in the phone
could not have been heard five feet away in his rooms.</p>

<p>A young woman awoke and yawned. This was in a luxurious apartment
in the vicinity of Park Avenue. One beautifully fashioned arm
stretched from her night garments of lacy silk. She picked up the
phone beside her bed.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she intoned, sleepily.</p>

<p>The words in her ear erased all of her indolence. She sat up
instantly, swinging her small bare feet to the floor. The young woman
was tall, of slender but almost regal proportions. Her most striking
feature was her wealth of bronze hair.</p>

<p>This cascaded in a golden mass around her ears. And her eyes were
of a golden hue, possessing hidden fire.</p>

<p>"Well, well and well!" she exclaimed. "I'd heard you were in
Malaysia, or perhaps it was Yucatan! What weapons shall I bring?"</p>

<p>Doc Savage said into the telephone:</p>

<p>"It isn't that kind of an assignment, Pat. It's something that
only one woman could do. You happen to be that woman."</p>

<p>"They all begin that way," said the young woman. "I shall prepare,
of course, to be shot, burned at the stake, kidnapped or thrown into
some deep, dark river. What is it? I'm practically dressed
already."</p>

<p>The young woman was Patricia Savage, cousin to the man of bronze.
She had always wanted to join Doc's group of adventurers. Excitement
and danger were her greatest and only loves.</p>

<p>Doc occasionally called upon her in cases where a woman could be
of assistance. He would not consider her as a regular companion. This
would have been too dangerous. Pat conducted a combined beauty parlor
and gymnasium in Park Avenue. With this she was highly
successful.</p>

<p>The man of bronze was speaking rapidly into the phone. The
beautiful Pat was performing a remarkable sleight-of-hand trick.
Holding the phone, she was employing one hand to don stockings and
shoes. Before Doc had finished speaking she had made good her word.
She was practically dressed.</p>

<p>Then Pat replied in a bored tone, "But a chaperon, Doc? Such a
sissy kind of a job! Anyway, I shall be well armed!"</p>

<p>Doc said into the phone, "There is no doubt but Lady Fotheran will
insist on going to Syria. I shall permit her to accompany us only
because I believe it is safer. But just now, other things are of
greatest importance. Make careful note of what I tell you."</p>

<p>Pat missed none of his next words.</p>

<p>Then she said, "An ocean flight? I'll love that, Doc. But as a
chaperon, of all things!"</p>

<p>Pat Savage replaced the phone. She was an amazing young woman.
Within five minutes she was gowned and cloaked. A small but
exceedingly efficient automatic pistol reposed in her purse.</p>

<p>"As a chaperon," she murmured, "I wonder who I'm supposed to
fight?"</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE returned to the laboratory.</p>

<p>"I have some news which will require our attention," he stated. "I
suggest that you, Lady Fotheran, and Mr. Dernall return to your
hotels, for the present. You stop regularly at the Fortescue Hotel,
Lady Fotheran. Johnny will see that you reach there safely."</p>

<p>"Could I be of assistance?" said Carson Dernall. "I would like to
remain with you, Mr. Savage, until some of this mystery is
solved."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful," stated Doc, "but I have a mission requiring
personal attention only."</p>

<p>The man of bronze did not divulge the disappearance of Monk and
Ham. Lady Fotheran's eyes showed her surprise that Doc should know
the hotel where she would be stopping. But she did not speak of
it.</p>

<p>Doc had checked on the reservation before Lady Fotheran arrived.
Carson Dernall named another hotel farther downtown, where he said he
could be reached.</p>

<p>"I feel it incumbent upon me to join you in solving the mystery of
tonight's happenings and the desert murder mirage," declared Dernall.
"With my experience among the Bedouins, I am sure I can be
valuable."</p>

<p>"I'm sure your experience will be valuable," agreed Doc. "You
shall hear from me."</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. A MOB GOES BLIND</h2>

<p>EIGHT stalwart policemen were guarding the murder shadow of the
woman in the window of the music store. Plainly enough, they did not
relish this duty.</p>

<p>That tall, silhouetted figure, with its one slender arm up-raised
as if to ward off death, looked too realistic to be a mere picture.
After the attempt to break the window, the eight policemen were on
the alert.</p>

<p>One copper inside and one outside were armed with short, ugly riot
guns. They were ready to blast enthusiastically the first suspicious
characters which might appear.</p>

<p>Bright brass trumpets and other musical instruments of silvery
color reflected the lights behind the unbroken plate glass. The play
of this illumination gave the murder shadow the appearance of being
in motion.</p>

<p>"Holy cat!" grunted one red-faced copper. "That picture looks like
the dame was still alive an' trying to run away from something! I'd
swear I saw the thing move!"</p>

<p>The pudgy proprietor of the store was in his small office at the
rear of the display room.</p>

<p>"I want they should get that crazy thing out of the window," he
complained repeatedly "Would you look? Nobody's coming in here to buy
a nickel's worth, as long as the picture stays there!"</p>

<p>The deputy medical examiner had insisted the murder shadow must be
kept intact. A heavy conference was being held in the coroner's
office. There was no precedent for performing an autopsy on plate
glass.</p>

<p>In normal weather, it should have been early daylight. But all of
Manhattan was shrouded in thick fog. Black mist wrapped all of the
metropolitan area. The sun had not yet arisen far enough to dispel
the gloom.</p>

<p>Workers employed in various forms of labor were beginning to
appear. Though this was the morning of July 5th, many were wearing
overcoats. The midsummer blizzard had left a chill in the air.</p>

<p>Men passing through the streets near the music store carried tools
and lunch boxes. The policemen on guard had no means of knowing that
a score or more men with the appearance of laborers were rapidly
converging on the scene of the murder window.</p>

<p>These men swung along individually. Each wore an overcoat. These
swathed some to their knees.</p>

<p>A bread truck, with huge loaves painted on its sides, stopped in
front of a store around a corner in the next block. A box of bread
was set out. The driver of the truck apparently took time out for a
sandwich and a cup of coffee at a near-by lunch stand.</p>

<p>The bread truck remained standing in front of the store.</p>

<p>Half a dozen laborers were approaching the murder window. Each
walked alone. Three came alongside the four policemen outside the
music store. Soundlessly, but with quick effectiveness, the other
three were inside the store.</p>

<p>"Inside, alla you mugs!" grated a voice. "We don't want to start
burnin', but--"</p>

<p>SNUB-NOSED automatics flashed into the hands of the laborers.
Wicked muzzles jammed into the stomachs of the policemen before they
could defend themselves. The two armed with riot guns had pistols
thrust into their stomachs.</p>

<p>"Why, you dirty rat!" rapped out one of the riot-gun coppers.</p>

<p>"Meanin' me?" growled one of the mobsters. His snub-nosed gun
crashed across the policeman's forehead as the riot gun was
lifted.</p>

<p>"Back into that office!" snarled a command. "All you get
goin'!"</p>

<p>The music store proprietor rushed out. He waved his fat hands.</p>

<p>"Hi, you can't do anything like that! I'll--"</p>

<p>There was a minor crack, like the breaking of a sharp stick. A
snub-nosed automatic with a clumsy-looking silencer on its snout
vomited fire. The music store man clapped his hands over his pudgy
stomach. He groaned and coughed. Scarlet threads appeared at the
corners of his round mouth.</p>

<p>Then he sat down and rolled over as if very tired.</p>

<p>"Back into that hole in the wall!" grated a harsh command. "We
mean business and we're in a hurry!"</p>

<p>At least a dozen more pseudo-laborers had joined the original six.
The weapons of the eight police were stripped from them. A score of
men with hard, grim faces pushed them into the little office of the
music store.</p>

<p>Two of the mobsters swung submachine guns. They planted themselves
in the doorway of the office. Some mobsters patrolled the outside.
Three men moved swiftly inside of the window of the murder picture.
Tools for cutting glass appeared in their hands.</p>

<p>From around the corner appeared the bread truck with the loaves
painted on its sides. The driver apparently took some interest in the
action around the music store. He parked the truck directly across
the street.</p>

<p>A glass-cutting tool gritted into the thick plate. The mobster
wielding it started a circle around the head and upraised arm of the
death-glow phantom.</p>

<p>"Make it snappy!" urged a voice behind the three men. "This is the
clean-up!"</p>

<p>The whole building housing the music store seemed to shake.</p>

<p>Blows that might have been struck with a sledge hammer jarred the
big door in the rear. A thick panel splintered and a gaping hole
appeared. Through this came a man's fist. It was an extraordinary
bunch of knuckles. They would have made three or four average
fists.</p>

<p>The lock was snapped open. The door swung inward.</p>

<p>Two huge figures appeared. They were beyond ordinary size. Their
great bulk caused them to whip into the store singly. Yet they moved
with such unbelievable suddenness that the mobsters failed to begin
shooting quickly enough. The score or more men had been directing
their attention upon the murder window.</p>

<p>THE two big men were strange apparitions. Each wore curiously
complicated goggles which covered the tip of his nose. These obscured
their features.</p>

<p>The hands of the goggled men flashed under their coats. One pair
of these hands moved with the speed of light. The other pair was a
bit slower and more clumsy. But in each pair appeared what might have
been mistaken for miniature fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>These were of some dull metal. Each had a release value and a
little wheel at the end. These wheels turned.</p>

<p>A dozen snakes suddenly released from a cage would have emitted
the same sound. It was a sibilant, angry hissing. One of the men at
the window yelled.</p>

<p>"Burn 'em! It's gas! They're cops!"</p>

<p>Even while their guns were jumping in their hands, the gunmen
discovered their bulky targets had faded from view. Vile oaths rang
out. The mobsters stopped shooting. They were groping about. Without
causing the slightest pain or smarting, the gas had blinded them
effectively.</p>

<p>This blinding gas was a new chemical. It was composed of various
sulphides combined with liquefied selenium. It was the first time
selenium had ever been successfully liquefied.</p>

<p>ONE of the big men swung around with his hissing tank of gas.
"Into the window," he ordered the other man. "I'll take care of the
outside."</p>

<p>Though the store was filled with the hubbub of shouts and oaths,
the command was spoken in an ordinary tone. One big man reached the
street doorway. The other sprang inside the display window of the
murder picture.</p>

<p>Holding the gas tank with one hand, the man in the window roared
with a booming voice. His free fist shot out with bone-crushing
impact. The mobsters with the glass cutters left their feet. One went
crashing through a side of plate glass into the store's entryway.</p>

<p>A police siren wailed in the black fog. A squad car rocketed
around the corner, brakes squealing. Almost before it had stopped,
newly arriving policemen were leaping from the doors.</p>

<p>When the fresh coppers hit the sidewalk, their guns were in their
hands. But they did not fire. They halted, as if invisible hands had
gripped their throats. They were in the dense opaqueness of the
blinding gas. It lay thickly about them, inert in the damp black
mist.</p>

<p>The choleric Inspector Carnahan rolled from the car.</p>

<p>"What the blazes now?" he gasped, clawing at his eyes. He may have
thought for a moment the black fog was responsible for his sudden
sightlessness. Then he roared, "Now I know Doc Savage is behind some
of this crazy stuff! Feel your way over to that window!"</p>

<p>BOTH the big men now were at the window. The one outside whipped a
small bottle from an inner pocket. He peered intently through the
clumsy goggles. From the bottle came a yellow, sharp-smelling fluid.
It flowed through a tiny rubber-hoselike device.</p>

<p>The liquid from the bottle followed the grisly outline of the
woman's shadow in the glass. One big hand pushed in the center of the
figure. The whole section of the heavy plate glass bent inward.</p>

<p>The weight of the glass was as much as two average men could have
lifted. The big, goggled man inside caught it with ease. Then he
shifted from the display window and picked his way rapidly through
the milling mobsters.</p>

<p>The goggled man outside slid along the building. The black fog
swallowed him.</p>

<p>"Great Jehoshaphat!" bellowed Inspector Carnaham. "They've gone
an' snatched the corpus delicti! The woman's gone!"</p>

<p>The blinded inspector was feeling cautiously along the smooth,
razorlike edges of the window glass from which the murder shadow had
been abducted under his very nose.</p>

<p>In the rear of the store, a car started. The motor of this car
gave forth no loud explosions. It was a mere hissing of an engine
that could deliver super-power almost silently.</p>

<p>The cursing mobsters were slowly recovering their sight. One man
ran outside and whistled softly. Others followed. A low whistle
replied from across the street. The "laborers" who had attempted to
snatch the murder shadow window poured into the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The rear doors of the bread truck opened. Men packed themselves
into the space. The truck started away with a clashing of gears.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. FUSSEIN, THE BEDOUIN</h2>

<p>THEIR noses were high-arched and thin as rapiers of bone. Set deep
in their skulls, beady black eyes glittered. Their skins were of the
color and texture of old copper.</p>

<p>When the elevator rose to the eighty-sixth floor of the impressive
skyscraper, one of the men stepped out. The other moved as if to
follow. One hand flashed under his coat. It came out bearing a
pointed knife.</p>

<p>The keen blade touched the throat of the elevator operator. The
youth paled, started to raise his hands, gasping, "Don't! What do you
want?"</p>

<p>The dark-skinned man with the knife spoke in perfect English.</p>

<p>"You will accompany us to the quarters of this Doc Savage. Make no
outcry and you will not be harmed. You are sure no one is now in
these quarters?"</p>

<p>"N-no one is there," stammered the scared operator. "But I don't
dare go in there."</p>

<p>"You will remain with us, or your time will be short," said the
dark-skinned man. "It is the will of Allah."</p>

<p>The youth preceded his captor. He knew nothing whatever about this
"Allah." But the knife was persuasive.</p>

<p>Both dark-skinned men wore correct American evening attire. The
neatness and elegance of their clothing had caused them to pass
muster in the lower corridor of the building.</p>

<p>But the piercing black eyes and beaklike nose of the leading man
might well have been the features of a sheik of sheiks. These men had
waited in the shadows of the rain-filled morning until they had
witnessed the departure of Doc Savage's companions from the
building.</p>

<p>The two Bedouins were prepared for trouble. They would have been
ready enough to kill.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the shaking elevator man, they halted before a
door. This bore in small bronze letters:</p>

<p>CLARK SAVAGE, JR.</p>

<p>The leading man dived hands into his pockets. A variety of
instruments were produced. The tools would have done credit to the
most expert American burglar. The sheiklike fellow tried one
instrument after another. The lock was of a pattern that resisted any
ordinary means of picking it.</p>

<p>Had Doc Savage been there, he would merely have raised his hands
and the door would have opened. The Bedouin knew nothing of selenium
cells and invisible electrical rays. He had never seen any kind of a
lock among the black tents of the desert.</p>

<p>The Bedouins talked in low voices. Their words were only gobbling
gutturals to the elevator man. They sounded sinister. The man's knees
persisted in knocking together.</p>

<p>The lock picker swore in Arabic over the stubborn door. He was
using a slender, curved tool. Suddenly the lock yielded. The door was
swinging open.</p>

<p>THE Bedouin's eyes darted about the bronze man's outer room. The
black orbs held deep suspicion. The opening of the door had puzzled
him. He was familiar with the instruments he had used. Well, perhaps
the wirelike tool was responsible. The Bedouin shrugged his skinny
shoulders.</p>

<p>Both visitors looked admiringly at the furnishings of Doc Savage's
office. They eyed the telephone contrivances. The complicated devices
were different from any telephones they had ever seen. They did not
know the bronze man's phones were equipped to record all calls and to
repeat all messages without the assistance of any person.</p>

<p>One Bedouin kept the persuasive point of his knife touching the
neck of the elevator man. The operator oozed perspiration. It ran
down his spine in a cold stream. If he got out of this alive, the
young man was firmly resolved to resign this job. This was the second
time he had had a run-in with some of Doc's peculiar visitors.</p>

<p>He judged the third time, if there was a third time, would be
three times and out.</p>

<p>The leading Bedouin crossed to the big library door. He pushed
tentatively at the chrome-steel panels. The door opened so readily
that he grunted and sprang to one side. His hand whipped to a knife
under his coat.</p>

<p>But the great library room was empty. The Bedouin murmured to his
companion. Interpreted, the words meant, "The All-Wise One must
know." A crafty smile came over the faces of both Bedouins.</p>

<p>Apparently they had great faith in this "All-Wise One."</p>

<p>One said, "He surely has prepared the way for us."</p>

<p>He spoke deep words of truth. The way had indeed been prepared,
but not as they imagined.</p>

<p>The Bedouins gobbled. They were speaking of "the bronze man" and
great wisdom. They were surveying the thousands of solidly shelved
books. If this Doc Savage knew the contents of one-tenth of these
volumes, he must have infinite knowledge, was their opinion.</p>

<p>After a thorough inspection of the library, the Bedouins moved
toward an inner door. This led to the bronze man's laboratory.</p>

<p>THE door opened at a touch. The leading Bedouin again whipped his
hand to the knife under his coat. The elevator man was suddenly
propelled ahead of the others. The point of the knife was sufficient
without any other order.</p>

<p>Though he was frightened, the elevator man gasped and almost
forgot his own predicament. He had never seen such a glittering array
of instruments. They arose mysteriously from the floor. Some reached
nearly to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Metal and marble boards were filled with innumerable devices and
lights.</p>

<p>The leading Bedouin moved his lips, as if he were praying. He was
doing just that. Here were weird marvels of mystic significance, as
he viewed them. Allah, the Prophet, was all-powerful in the desert.
But the Bedouin wasn't so sure Allah would know much about all
this.</p>

<p>The veritable forest of machines, the chemical and scientific
contraptions plainly were awe-inspiring to the Bedouins. After all,
they were simple Arabs of the desert.</p>

<p>The Bedouin leader licked his tongue across his papery-thin lips.
He moved with infinite caution, careful not to touch any of the many
devices. He knew all the hardships and dangers of the Rahia, the
drive over waterless spaces; the threats of the ghrazzu, when enemy
tribes were robbed of their treasures.</p>

<p>Those things he understood. These things he did not.</p>

<p>Telling his companion to remain near the door, the leader moved
carefully down the long middle aisle of the laboratory. He acted as
if he were lost in a forest of eerie possibilities.</p>

<p>A square desk lay close to his right hand. The Bedouin became as
motionless as a statue. His tongue unwrapped some choice language.
The other Bedouin craned forward, staring.</p>

<p>Both saw the ancient, worn stone with the Himyarite symbolism.
Their gobbled words were exclamations which indicated they were
familiar with that stone. But it was not now as they had last seen
it.</p>

<p>Both Bedouins proved by their excitement they had seen the stone
when it glowed with bright, bluish fire. Now the stone was red. It
sparkled with the vivid scarlet of running blood from a freshly made
wound.</p>

<p>One bony, coppery hand reached forth gingerly. The Bedouin's
finger tips touched the Himyarite stone.</p>

<p>A shrill cry slavered from the Bedouin's lips. His hand was flung
upward by some invisible force. A strange shiver ran through his long
figure. The Bedouin's legs seemed to take on the weakness of water.
They collapsed and he fell on his face in the aisle.</p>

<p>None noticed what the Bedouin leader had failed to perceive. The
red Himyarite stone was enwrapped with fine copper wires. These were
no thicker than hairs. Almost invisible, they crossed the floor and
disappeared behind one of the metal switchboards.</p>

<p>The Bedouin's own body had closed a contact. This had given him
only a light electrical shock.</p>

<p>DISCOVERING himself, probably to his great surprise, to be still
alive, the floored Bedouin scrambled to his feet in bewilderment. He
gazed at his long, sinewy fingers. They were slightly marked, as if
he had touched fire.</p>

<p>His beady black eyes took on an evil, purposeful gleam. In the
dark orbs was fear, but the Bedouin had come into this place upon a
mission. That he would attempt to accomplish.</p>

<p>He was, after all, an Arab, sworn even to his life for the man he
had designated as the All-Wise One.</p>

<p>One hand swooped upon the red Himyarite stone. He conquered the
tremor of the slight shock and jerked the stone away, thrusting it
under his coat. The fine copper wires parted.</p>

<p>"Let us depart quickly!" he exclaimed in Arabic, and turned toward
the door.</p>

<p>The other Bedouin turned. Both stood as if rooted to the floor.
The elevator man shivered and his eyes almost popped out.</p>

<p>A weird blue flame, thin as a sheet, had jumped across the doorway
leading back to the library. Spears of hissing, crackling blue
rippled up and down and across the only means of egress. The flames
formed a barrier over every inch of the space.</p>

<p>The Bedouin with the Himyarite stone ran out of the aisle and over
to the wall. He was seeking some window. But there was none.</p>

<p>The Bedouin went carefully, touching nothing more. Lights went
out, as a candle might have been snuffed. But the blue flames played
mockingly across the door. Then the lights came on again.</p>

<p>The second Bedouin had a quick idea.</p>

<p>"You have the knowledge of all this," he said to the dazed
elevator man. "You will release us, or you will die!"</p>

<p>"No! No! What would I know about Doc Savage's gadgets?" howled the
operator.</p>

<p>The Bedouin pushed the point of the knife into the flesh of the
operator's neck. The young man screamed. Blood oozed and reddened the
polished blade.</p>

<p>"That will be quite enough of that," spoke a calm voice. "You will
remove the knife at once. He cannot aid you."</p>

<p>THE Bedouin stared. At the end of the long aisle stood what to
them was a giant. His body would have made the two of them in its
weight. His skin was shining bronze. His smooth hair seemed to be
almost a continuation of the golden hue of his corded neck.</p>

<p>Renny, Johnny and Long Tom stood beside him. Renny's big hand held
a supermachine pistol.</p>

<p>"With this," his voice boomed, "I can, and will, pulverize the
both of you, if that knife isn't dropped instantly!"</p>

<p>The Bedouins knew firearms. They had never seen a weapon just like
this one, but they were well aware it must be deadly. The knife was
released. It clanged on the floor. With a scarlet thread trickling
and staining his collar, the elevator man staggered to one side and
sat down on the floor.</p>

<p>Renny walked around the two Bedouins and stood between them and
the doorway of blue flame. Long Tom went over to the wall and pushed
a button. The crackling barrier vanished.</p>

<p>Doc Savage took a slip of paper from a pocket. He pulled the
elevator man to his feet.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry this happened, and you showed good nerve," he said to
the elevator man. "You can go now."</p>

<p>The operator found a slip of paper in his hand. He walked out,
rubbing the slight wound in his neck. His face was still chalky, but
he mustered a grin. The paper was a hundred-dollar bill.</p>

<p>"Put them in chairs," said the man of bronze. "Then we'll have a
little talk."</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny whipped the Bedouins into chairs facing the open
library door. They were within a few inches of the doorway. At a
signal from Doc, cords were whipped around the man who had taken the
Himyarite stone. Renny stood close guard over the other Bedouin.</p>

<p>The black eyes of the man with the stone became almost opaque. The
little whirlwinds in the flaky gold eyes of the bronze man stirred,
and he spoke.</p>

<p>"You will tell me who sent you here," Doc stated.</p>

<p>The Bedouin started. Points of flame came into his black orbs. Doc
Savage had spoken in the purest of Arabic. The Bedouin's eyes lanced
at him defiantly, but the man could not conceal his amazement.</p>

<p>The Arabic tongue is one of the most difficult. Never before had
the Bedouin heard any ferengi, foreigner, speak it with such fluency.
Still the Bedouin clutched the Himyarite stone under his coat. The
cords holding him to the chair had not been fastened around his arms
or feet.</p>

<p>"You are not the one I expected," announced Doc, still speaking in
Arabic. "But you will tell me about him."</p>

<p>The man of bronze was looking deep into the Bedouin's eyes. He was
employing his hypnotic power to compel an answer. But the black orbs
were unyielding. The Bedouin smiled fleetingly, mockingly. He would
not permit his will to be overcome.</p>

<p>"We electrocute murderers in this country," Doc advised. He had
some trouble finding an Arabic word for electrocute, but he managed
to convey his meaning. "You are a murderer. You will tell all."</p>

<p>The Bedouin made only one answer.</p>

<p>"I am in the hands of Allah."</p>

<p>LONG TOM pressed the button on the wall. Blue flame hissed and
crackled with a weird glowing over the man's coppery skin. A movement
of the slightest would have caused the Bedouin to touch the lethal
barrier across the doorway. The spears writhed close around his
knees. They seemed to be reaching for him.</p>

<p>The Bedouin's lips moved, but he said nothing aloud.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" grunted Renny. "Do we really have to bump him
off?"</p>

<p>Doc Savage shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>"It is the sheer fatalism of his kind. He has determined he will
die rather than talk."</p>

<p>The hands of the bronze man were busy. He had been filling a small
hypodermic syringe. The plunger was held conveniently under one
thumb.</p>

<p>The blinding mass of electrical flame was close to the Bedouin's
face. He closed his eyes, but otherwise he remained imperturbable.
The high-frequency current was a lurid wall, horribly close. The
Bedouin, knowing only the desert code, had no doubt but that he was
to die soon.</p>

<p>But his head was stiffly upright. As befitted a true son of Islam,
he still retained his own thoughts. His companion also remained
silent, but watching closely.</p>

<p>"Who sent you here?" demanded Doc. "Why are you in this
country?"</p>

<p>The words were in Arabic, but they elicited no reply.</p>

<p>The Bedouin was murmuring now. The words were, "Bismillah el
Rahman el Rahhim." The prayer of the faithful Mohammedan in extreme
peril. "In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!"</p>

<p>Doc knew then the Bedouin would never talk through fear. He had
resigned himself to his fate. With him, the end had been reached. He
had failed in his mission. Though of a murderous band, he would be
faithful to the All-Wise One.</p>

<p>Doc's hands moved swiftly. It was hardly a touch on the Bedouin's
shoulder. But the needle of the hypo had penetrated.</p>

<p>The syringe contained a special truth serum which had been devised
by the man of bronze. Now, Doc's flaky gold eyes stirred with greater
force. At last they were compelling the black ones. The Bedouin
stared at him.</p>

<p>The Bedouin was coming under the hypnotizing influence of Doc. The
truth serum was bringing about an irresistible inertia. The serum was
effective mostly because it numbed the victim's resistance. The power
of his will was crumbling.</p>

<p>THE Bedouin began mumbling in Arabic. Doc's gaze held him.</p>

<p>Johnny was standing close. His bony figure bent over.</p>

<p>"He says his name is Fussein," repeated Johnny. "He's saying they
came on a black boat. Mentions some one he calls the All-Wise
One--Listen, Doc! Monk and Ham! He says the money man and the sworn
man are on the black boat! Now he's mumbling about Allah--Look out,
Doc!"</p>

<p>The Bedouin suddenly screamed, "Bismillah, el Raizhim!"</p>

<p>None had seen the furtive movement of the Bedouin's hand under his
coat. The ancient Himyarite stone plunked to the floor. The cry of
the man in the chair was his death scream.</p>

<p>Unnoticed, the Bedouin had palmed a dagger from his sleeve. He had
jerked his arm upward and pushed his body sidewise. There was a
squashy, ripping sound.</p>

<p>Bright red blood from the heart spouted through the Bedouin's
shirt and trickled scarlet over the hand that had held the knife. He
had thrust the blade under his coat directly up under his ribs.</p>

<p>The encarmined blade came out and its handle rang metallically on
the floor. The Bedouin drooped forward. He was dead.</p>

<p>"One of the few who ever beat Doc," muttered big Renny.</p>

<p>The engineer, who had been guarding the other Bedouin, forgot his
prisoner for the moment. With Johnny and Long Tom, Renny stared at
the slumped figure of the dead man. Blood still dripped on the
floor.</p>

<p>The other Bedouin had not been secured by cords. His eyes were
cold as black ice. They resembled those of a snake about to strike.
He gathered his legs beneath him until only the toes touched the
floor. From this position, he sprang.</p>

<p>"I deeply regret the inadvertence of this," stated Doc, all his
attention apparently upon the corpse in the chair.</p>

<p>The Bedouin's figure shot toward him. A straight dagger had come
from his sleeve. The Arabs had been well equipped with spare, hidden
weapons. The broad, corded shoulders of the man of bronze afforded a
wide target that could hardly be missed.</p>

<p>The Bedouin hissed an Asiatic curse. The needlelike point of his
weapon struck squarely between Doc's shoulders. The dagger was driven
by all of the Bedouin's weight. Long Tom's sallow, unhealthy face
became the color of chalk.</p>

<p>"Doc, look out!" he exploded. "Renny! Grab him!"</p>

<p>Doc's head snapped forward and down. The bronze man seemed to move
only slightly. His powerful legs bent at the knees, as if he had been
mortally hit and was sagging to the floor. The Bedouin's arm quivered
with the force of the knife blow.</p>

<p>Doc's right hand came back over one shoulder. The tendons of his
wrist, powerful and pliant as piano wires sheathed in bronze, played
under the skin. His fingers hooked the Bedouin's neck just under the
base of the skull. The man of bronze was on one knee.</p>

<p>The Bedouin squawked. His cry trailed through the air. For he was
whirling over and over, like a club flipped by one end. His body
turned two complete somersaults as it flew through the library
doorway.</p>

<p>When the other Bedouin had knifed his own heart, Long Tom had cut
off the electrical current forming the blue-flamed barrier.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" cried Johnny, hoarsely. "Doc,
are you hurt!"</p>

<p>Doc's hand flicked toward the Bedouin's knife on the floor. The
needlelike point had been bent as if it had struck granite. The man
of bronze shrugged his wide shoulders. There might be a slight bruise
where the knife had struck.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" thundered Renny. "Just for a second, I forgot the
vest!"</p>

<p>Doc was wearing the thin undervest of woven metal. Bullets could
not penetrate this. The force of the knife blow had been
negligible.</p>

<p>The Bedouin rolled to his feet in the outer office. His dark face
wore a dazed expression. He stared unbelievingly at Doc Savage. But
he did not halt more than two seconds. With a curse, he twisted and
pivoted toward the corridor door.</p>

<p>RENNY'S bulky body was shoving through the library door. The
engineer was stopped as abruptly as if he had encountered a rigid bar
of steel. This was the bronze man's extended arm.</p>

<p>"Permit him to go," Doc said softly. "It fits in with my
plans."</p>

<p>One glance at the elevator doors and the Bedouin whipped toward
the stairway at the end of the corridor. He did not care to encounter
any of the operators. The story of what had happened on the
eighty-sixth floor would have been spread by this time. The Bedouin
glided down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Be sure you have everything, brothers," counseled Doc Savage. "We
will give him one minute. It is a long way down by the
stairways."</p>

<p>The man of bronze picked up the knife with which Fussein had kept
his faith with his murder chief, the All-Wise One.</p>

<p>"More than a hundred years are in that blade," stated Doc. "Its
harvest probably has been extensive."</p>

<p>The knife was a straight, thick eight-inch blade set deep in a
solid metal hilt. On one side was stamped a rough crescent, with the
date of origin and forging--"MEDINA, IN THE YEAR 1243 OF THE MOSLEM
CALENDAR." In the Christian accounting of time, that would be the
year 1825. On the other side, almost obscured by the film of blood
and oil, was an inscription.</p>

<p>It was the ancient battle cry of the Jehad: "THISHAHUM, BISM ER
RASSOUL!"</p>

<p>It was the cry heard by Doc in the alley, the same cry resounding
when Monk and Ham were taken.</p>

<p>"Kill in the name of the Prophet!"</p>

<p>Doc glided toward the high-speed elevator. His three companions
followed. They descended. Doc, Johnny and Long Tom stood in the black
fog as the Bedouin slipped into a closed car parked around a
corner.</p>

<p>Another sedan of ordinary appearance swung to the curb. Renny was
at the wheel. He had gotten the car from the basement garage. Doc
swung to a place on the running board.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX. CHASE THROUGH THE FOG</h2>

<p>THE morning's black fog paralyzed motor traffic. The few
venturesome drivers abroad in the earlier hours moved their cars
slowly.</p>

<p>In the lower harbor, ferries and tugboats hooted constantly. They
proceeded with excessive caution. Water craft not engaged on
scheduled trips remained safely at anchor or beside their
wharves.</p>

<p>On Northern Boulevard, the highway forming the main artery of
travel along the upper North Shore of Long Island, one driver seemed
to be disregarding all the rules of safety. Persons who observed the
flashing speed of the shadowy automobile in the dense fog gasped with
profound amazement.</p>

<p>Twice the speeder was picked up. Once it was a motorcycle cop.
After the policeman had narrowly missed climbing the hood of a
juggernaut truck, he gave up the chase profanely. The second time it
was a radio patrol car. The driver swore vehemently when the
lightless car bored away from him with uncanny skill.</p>

<p>"Bet we've got those cops thinkin' we're some kind of a ghost!"
chuckled Renny, at the wheel of the apparent phantom car. "They'll
probably swear they didn't see us!"</p>

<p>"The report will be worse than that," suggested Long Tom. "They
couldn't miss seeing Doc outside."</p>

<p>The man of bronze was erect on the running board of the speeding
sedan. The wet mist of the black fog slapped in his face. Drops of
water slid off the smooth bronze hair, as if it were waterproof.</p>

<p>Doc and his companions were wearing curiously shaped goggles. The
lenses of these were large. The affairs looked clumsy. These were
equipped with small switches. From inside the goggles came a
whirring, as if small generators were operating.</p>

<p>While the headlights of the car were off, there was light. But
this was invisible to any person not wearing the bronze man's
especially contrived goggles.</p>

<p>Ahead of the flying car, all objects stood out distinctly in the
black fog. The highway was bathed in strange luminance. There was no
color even to the greenest of trees. Everything was etched in black
and white.</p>

<p>This invisible ray was supplied by an infra-red projector on the
sedan. Through the goggles, driving was made safe enough.</p>

<p>The further illusion of a ghost car was given by the silence of
the motor. Though possessing super-power, the engine gave forth only
a low, hissing sound. And this was the reason the swift approach of
the Doc Savage sedan was undetected by the drivers of two other
cars.</p>

<p>THE sedan had crossed the city limits of New York. With
undiminished speed, it flashed over the low hills of Nassau County.
If the black fog had not been present, strips of the blue water of
Long Island Sound would have showed at intervals.</p>

<p>The two cars ahead leaped into the infra-red ray shortly after the
sedan had passed through the historic Colonial settlement of
Roslyn.</p>

<p>The cars fleeing ahead of the sedan were using headlights. But the
drivers were compelled to hold to a speed less than half of that of
the sedan. Doc's car, a silently moving armored vehicle equipped with
bulletproof glass could neither be seen nor heard by the drivers of
the two automobiles ahead.</p>

<p>In one of these cars was the Bedouin who had fled from Doc's
headquarters in Manhattan. Believing he had escaped cleanly, the Arab
was doing what the bronze man had suspected he would.</p>

<p>He was making directly for a secluded bay of Long Island Sound
where a black boat he was looking for might logically be expected to
anchor. And it was with the hope of finding the missing Ham and Monk
that the man of bronze had deliberately permitted the Bedouin to
escape.</p>

<p>"Kind of funny, isn't it, Doc," came the voice of Long Tom, "that
there should be two cars? There was only one when we first picked up
the Bedouin."</p>

<p>The man of bronze said nothing. His giant body was as motionless
as if he were a part of the car. The flaky gold eyes were
concentrating on the rear car of the fleeing pair. Both automobiles
had come from Manhattan. Undoubtedly, both had the same
objective.</p>

<p>"It will be only a short distance down the road," stated Doc.
"Watch for their turn-off, so we don't overshoot."</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll--"</p>

<p>Renny did not finish. The sedan was running so silently that the
slightest sound could be heard. At this point, the nearest house sat
nearly half a mile distant on top of the hill to the right.</p>

<p>A woman's scream rippled along the black fog. It was a shrill,
piercing note. But there was neither fright nor terror in it. Rather
the cry seemed to have been uttered for the definite purpose of being
heard.</p>

<p>In the rear window of the nearest car ahead, two heads loomed up
starkly black and white in the infra-red ray.</p>

<p>"That was what I expected," said Doc, quietly. "Now step on it,
Renny. Pass both cars."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" ejaculated Renny. "They've got a woman in that last
car! I'll bet they've grabbed Lady Fotheran!"</p>

<p>DOC said nothing. He bent his head slightly, as the sedan shot
ahead. The motor was capable of far more than a hundred miles an
hour. The fogged wind tore at the bronze man's clothing.</p>

<p>It was a tricky feat, passing the other two cars on the narrow
highway. Doc directed no warning be given. Renny squeezed the sedan
out on the parkway.</p>

<p>Two amazed drivers saw what must have seemed to be a thunderbolt
hurtling noiselessly out of the night. No horn had been sounded. No
lights had appeared. But the sedan rushed uncannily by, its fenders
grazing the bodies of the other cars.</p>

<p>There were four men in the rear car. Five, for on the floor in the
rear lay a bound-and-gagged man. Between two men on the rear seat sat
a woman. A dark-skinned Bedouin in American clothes clapped his hand
over the woman's mouth.</p>

<p>"You'll keep quiet, Lady Fotheran," he grated, "or we'll be forced
to gag you!"</p>

<p>The woman sat stiffly erect. She made no effort to free herself
from the throttling hand.</p>

<p>The driver emitted an oath. He was a white man with a crooked,
evil face.</p>

<p>"There ain't any guy livin' could drive without lights in this
fog! An' did you see that big mug standin' on the side? He didn't
look human!"</p>

<p>In the lights of the other car, the figure of Doc Savage,
magnified by the fog, looked almost supernatural.</p>

<p>"An' that guy ain't human," replied the man beside the driver. "If
that ain't Doc Savage, then I don't know my onions! Hey! We'd better
hold up here an' ditch the dame!"</p>

<p>This man was dragging a machine gun up between his knees. The car
ahead swerved between Doc's sedan and the rear car.</p>

<p>"If that black heathen'd only get out of the way," complained the
gunner, "I'd soon find out how human Savage is."</p>

<p>The bottom of the windshield was lifted. The man thrust the Tommy
gun through the aperture, holding it in readiness.</p>

<p>The dark-skinned man in the rear seat spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"You'd only be wasting bullets," he said. "Doc Savage has those
big tires filled with sponge rubber. You can't puncture them. The car
is armored."</p>

<p>"Hooey!" rapped the gunner. "Well, this Savage mug himself ain't
full of sponge rubber--an' he'll be full of hot lead, if that boob
ever pulls over!"</p>

<p>The woman in the rear seat was sitting rigidly. The dark-skinned
man--he was known as Mr. Kassan--who had displayed such surprising
knowledge of Doc Savage, had removed his gagging hand. The woman's
golden eyes were staring ahead. After her hysterical scream, she had
apparently been in a semi-coma.</p>

<p>But one small foot was rubbing against the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman threw one arm across her eyes. The car was
filled with an unearthly, blinding light.</p>

<p>The driver swore wildly. His brakes squawled. The car left the
highway and tipped its nose into the ditch above the road.</p>

<h2>Chapter X. BLACK MAGIC</h2>

<p>WITH the blinding light which hurled the car into the ditch, an
astounding thing had happened. The small foot of the woman in the
rear seat had exploded, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>"You would insist, Lady Fotheran!" rasped the dark Mr. Kassan.</p>

<p>His doubled fist smashed sidewise. Had the woman been in the same
position, the beautiful face would have caught the full impact of the
blow. But she had thrown herself forward, hands gripping the back of
the front seat.</p>

<p>It was then the car dived and slapped over on its side, with a
splintering crash. The door on the upper side burst open. The slender
figure of the woman went through the aperture with the floating
lightness of a specter.</p>

<p>The man on that side was groaning and clamping his hands over his
blinded eyes. The woman's arm still was tightly held over her own
golden orbs. She ran a few yards down the highway and sprang across
the ditch. With the speed of a deer, she lost herself in the woods
above the road.</p>

<p>Curses and groans rolled from the wrecked car. But the four men
apparently had suffered no serious injuries. All crawled into the
highway, arose to their feet and staggered blindly. The explosion of
the chemical powder in the woman's shoe rendered them comparatively
helpless. They would be that way for several minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Kassan was smart, and he remained cooler than the others.</p>

<p>"Our sight being lost," he said calmly, "we cannot pursue Lady
Fotheran. It would be wisest for all of us to be some other place
before Doc Savage can return. Place your hands on each other's
shoulders. Now follow me. There is a small boat concealed not far
from here. The powder will not blind us for long."</p>

<p>The four men filed across the road. They vanished in the brush
toward the small bay. With hands extended, touching each other, they
looked like convicts on parade.</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE saw the bright light of the chemical explosion. Then
the splintering crash of the car sounded in the road behind them.</p>

<p>The other car was now only a few yards in the rear of Doc's
armored sedan. The glass of its windshield crashed. Almost instantly,
a machine gun began a snarling song of death. The bronze man felt the
jolt of two bullets tearing at his bulletproof vest. He swung inside
with Johnny, who was in the rear-seat.</p>

<p>Slugs rained on the armored body. Some flattened on the glass of
the rear window, leaving it filled with spidery cracks. Bullets
nipped at the rear tires. They were ineffective. As Mr. Kassan had
seemed to know, the tires were filled with spongy rubber. No shots
could deflate them.</p>

<p>"We must return," stated Doc. "Let them have it, Renny."</p>

<p>Renny reached to the instrument board and twisted a knob. He
pulled this out. The headlights of the pursuing car were immediately
submerged in what seemed to be a spreading cloud.</p>

<p>The chemical smoke screen was one of the many devices of Doc
Savage. It was made more effective by being composed of gummy
particles, which adhered to the glass of the following headlights. In
a few seconds, these were completely obscured.</p>

<p>The machine gun still racketed. Slugs screamed from the concrete,
but they were whining with wildness. Brakes squealed and Doc knew the
car's driver had been forced to pull up.</p>

<p>"Turn around the first place you can, and we'll go back," said the
man of bronze, at the same time slipping out and dropping lightly
into the highway.</p>

<p>DOC passed into the opaque chemical fog of his own creation. Here
he whipped the clumsy infra-red-ray goggles from his eyes. His vision
was several times as keen as that of the average man, but in this
screen he could see nothing.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he ran with amazing speed. He was more anxious to
reach the car that had been wrecked than the nearer one carrying the
Bedouin he had permitted to escape that he might trail him. But when
he almost collided with the first car, it was stopped in the middle
of the highway.</p>

<p>Doc would have passed on silently, but the screen-shrouded car had
a strange aspect. Though bullets had poured from it only the minute
or two before, no one seemed to be in the closed, black auto. Doc
listened intently, then started on.</p>

<p>He reached the other car, lying on its side in the ditch. A
gurgling moan came from inside the car. The man of bronze halted,
flexing his cabled muscles. His extraordinary ears picked out all
sounds and classified them. Only one man was in the car. Doc could
have heard them breathing, if there had been more than one.</p>

<p>The man in the car emitted a choking, coughing gurgle. He was
straining to rise from the floor of the car.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he sputtered. It sounded like "oolp! oolp!" through
the tape across his lips. The man was apparently trying to feel his
way out of the car. He was using his chin for this purpose, his
wrists being bound behind his back. Tape cut off his sight.</p>

<p>Doc pulled the man to his feet. He loosened the cords on the man's
wrists and let him pull the tape from his own eyes and mouth. The man
of bronze picked up a piece of the tape that fell to the floor of the
car. He rubbed it between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage!" exclaimed the man, as soon as he had cleared one
eye. "I hoped it would be you! I'd just about given up hope of
getting out of this, when the car turned over. Where have those
Bedouins gone?"</p>

<p>"I did not see them leave," stated Doc. "Apparently, they were in
a hurry. What happened?"</p>

<p>The man groaning over the agony of the loosening tape was Carson
Dernall. His pallid face was whiter than usual.</p>

<p>"I RECEIVED a telephone message at my hotel saying Lady Fotheran
was in trouble," said Dernall. "I started out to go to her hotel and
two men put guns in my back as I came out on the street. They pushed
me into a car. Then one hit me over the head. That's all I know until
I came to my senses on the floor and we were traveling.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago, I heard the driver swearing. That must have
been when you passed. Then the shooting started. Suddenly the car was
wrecked. All of the men piled out and they must have run away."</p>

<p>Doc Savage nodded and said nothing. He was moving back along the
highway. Dernall followed closely, glancing furtively around as if he
feared his captors would return. Renny had found a wide spot in a
driveway and was coming back.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from Doc came the exotic trilling sound. Its rare
tuneless music filled the black fog for considerable space.
Immediately, there was a rustling noise in the bushes above the
highway. Doc's flashlight beam picked out a face that was attractive,
though now it was scratched and liberally smeared with dirt.</p>

<p>A woman came limping into the highway. She was wearing only one
whole shoe. A portion of the other one hung in tatters by its ankle
strap.</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc," said the woman coolly, "the next time you put a
torpedo in my heel, you'll know it. I thought you said that stuff
wouldn't hurt anybody but the other fellow, if I'd keep my arm over
my eyes."</p>

<p>Doc's handsome features broke in a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"I did not advise you to explode the chemical while it was still
in the heel of your shoe," he stated.</p>

<p>"Well, I hadn't any chance to get it out, so I set it off and took
a chance," said the woman. "And this was supposed to be a quiet
little job of playing chaperon. Anyway, I shot a man."</p>

<p>Patricia Savage sat down on the running board of the wrecked car
and nursed her scorched foot. Her bronze hair had lost the smooth
appearance that had helped make her so strongly resemble Lady
Fotheran. It tumbled in a golden cascade over her ears. She smiled up
at Doc.</p>

<p>"Now what do we play?" she inquired, impudently. "And will it be
all right if I take off the other shoe?"</p>

<p>"I'll send you home, the first car comes along," said Doc. "We are
facing a serious situation. We must find the black boat before the
men from the cars reach there, or Ham and Monk may suffer."</p>

<p>"I'm not going home in the first car or any other car," asserted
Pat. "I'm wrapping up my foot, and I'm going with you!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" snorted Johnny. "In that
nightgown?"</p>

<p>Pat tossed her head defiantly. She was clad in a lacy negligee, in
which she had been carried from Lady Fotheran's hotel. Doc had
suspected an attack on Lacy Fotheran, and had Pat make up to look
like the titled English woman and substitute for her at her
hotel.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. WHEN THE BAY BURNED</h2>

<p>WHITEY Jano annoyed others by juggling popcorn into his mouth and
crunching it. This had Runt Davis walking wildly up and down,
mouthing oaths.</p>

<p>"This is beginning to look like a lousy double-cross to me!"
howled Runt Davis, to make himself heard above the crunch-crunch of
Whitey Jano's slow, heavy jaws. "Lookit what I get! An' now you're
sayin' you don't know whether it's worth playin' across! Who's payin'
me for this flipper? That's what I wanta know!"</p>

<p>Runt waved the bandaged stump where his right hand had been. His
bullet head jerked up and down on his long neck.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano spoke with unctuous oiliness in his tone.</p>

<p>"Ever hear the quotation 'an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth'?" he remarked, cheerfully. "You can't expect to shave off a
couple of ears and not pay up. Hadith is an unusually smart
fellow."</p>

<p>Runt whipped himself over in front of Whitey. Whitey juggled some
more popcorn into his mouth. The white hair that gave him his name
was snowy. His dark features were fattish and globular. His deep,
black eyes seemed constantly filled with gloom. He might well have
been some Asiatic monk, or perhaps the priest of an ancient
temple.</p>

<p>Whitey's asset was his benevolent aspect. He looked upon the
excited Runt with a fatherly eye. Runt was enraged.</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' yuh this mix-up ain't comin' out for you!" he raved.
"The boys don't get this! We're goin' along sweet, an' then along
come these black heathen an' go to work for you! Or maybe you're
workin' for them! Twice they've busted into the rest of us! We're
told to snatch this Fotheran dame, an' along comes Hadith!"</p>

<p>"He was only following instructions," said Whitey, gently. "We
changed our minds. We learned she had already reached Doc Savage. We
followed the wisest course in having her freed for the time. Doc
Savage was right on the spot. It's all we could do."</p>

<p>"An' I suppose this black Hadith was told to start choppin', an'
that's why Tulary was bumped off?" snapped Runt. "All I'm askin' is
one good crack at this heathen! This time, it won't be his ears!"</p>

<p>Whitey crunched loudly on his popcorn for a minute.</p>

<p>"You shave off Hadith's ears without asking questions when you
size him up as spying on the penthouse, when he was there by our
orders," said Whitey, patiently. "Probably you thought that was
funny. And some of you playful fellows stuck a knife in another one.
Perhaps you're not aware you have caused Hadith to lose face when he
returns to the desert."</p>

<p>"He'll not have any face and he'll never get back where he come
from!" screeched Runt, his head bobbing like a curious turtle
catching flies. "First, you tell us the boys will be in on one of the
biggest splits ever come off, an' then right in the middle of it you
ring in this bunch of camel herders. Them shadow bump-offs has got us
all headed for the seat!"</p>

<p>Whitey flipped a snowy grain of popcorn into the air. He caught it
between his teeth and crunched.</p>

<p>"You are surprisingly astute, Runt, my boy. All of you are headed
for the hot seat, if you're caught. That's why you're calling it all
even with Hadith and forgetting. You're coming along and like it.
Stick around the big town and they be slitting your pants legs
upriver before you know it."</p>

<p>"I'm not calling off anything with that black heathen!" shouted
Runt. "The minute I put eyes on him, I'm turnin' on the heat!"</p>

<p>"Then put your eyes behind you, Runt, my boy," suggested Whitey
between crunches. "And if you're wise, you'll hang on to the one hand
you've got."</p>

<p>THE tall figure of the Nubian-faced Hadith had appeared behind
Runt. The ebony face was a stony black mask. The eyes of the former
slave to a sheik of sheiks were red-rimmed and burning with murderous
hate.</p>

<p>The heavy, curved scimitar with the jeweled handle swished slowly
back and forth. But it was not Hadith who had brought the scream of
utter horror into Runt's constricting throat.</p>

<p>Beside Hadith were ranged six other figures. Their faces were the
color of leaden corpses. Two carried pronglike instruments resembling
iceman's tongs with long handles. Two others swung a carved wooden
cradlelike affair between them. Inside the cradle something like a
ball rolled and thumped against the ends.</p>

<p>Hadith voiced a direct question in Arabic. It consisted of only
three short words. They meant, "Shall it be?"</p>

<p>"No! Not that way, chief! Any other way!"</p>

<p>Whitey Jano casually tossed popcorn into his round mouth. He
crunched it slowly. He spoke. Runt's little eyes popped more, if that
were possible.</p>

<p>Jano had spoken in Arabic. Runt hadn't known his chief spoke the
language. The words were sharp. The black Hadith dropped swiftly to
one knee in an obeisance. Runt observed this submission in terrified
bewilderment. Hadith signaled to the masked figures. They faded from
the long room.</p>

<p>"Runt, my boy," spoke Whitey Jano, in a soothing, kindly voice,
"you and the others are much wanted by the police. By some error, it
seems the members of the mob are the only suspects in these deaths of
the shadows."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was a mistake," mumbled Runt. "But they was funny
mistakes."</p>

<p>Jano's jaws crunched slowly.</p>

<p>"We will call them mistakes," he said, unctuously. "Still, you and
the others will benefit greatly by accompanying us. Matters have
suddenly reached a crisis. Within an hour possibly, we shall be
departing. You will get a square deal in the land over there, I will
see to that."</p>

<p>Runt Davis slumped into a chair, nursing his bloody arm.</p>

<p>"We'll have to depend on that, chief," he said, and his long neck
was rigid. "I'm not fooled. We've been made too hot to stay here. It
wasn't any mistake."</p>

<p>The long room swayed rhythmically. Water slapped and sighed away
in long, running swells outside. The long room was the luxuriously
fitted cabin of a long yacht that looked like it had speed. It was
painted black.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano flipped popcorn into the air. His jaws crunched in
time with the little slapping waves that rode the swells.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a monkey cracking peanuts," suggested a biting,
sarcastic voice in a small stateroom at the end of the yacht
cabin.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" squealed another voice. "This ain't any time to be
funny! Anyway, you eat the same way! You'd think it was a pig gnawin'
a ear of corn!"</p>

<p>ANY one acquainted with Doc Savage's adventurers would have
instantly identified the voice of Monk and Ham. Even in the face of
greatest danger, this pair maintained their verbal feud. Somehow,
their morale was higher when they were thus slapping at each
other.</p>

<p>Ham did not reply to Monk. But the apish chemist howled in his
strangely childlike voice.</p>

<p>"Ouch! You dag-goned shyster! You do that again an' I'll ram my
foot right through where you put your grub!"</p>

<p>Ham grinned. It was a ghastly sort of grin on his sharp features.
For the lawyer's astute countenance was caked with mud and filth from
the alley in which he and Monk had been captured. Only the night
before, his sartorial perfection would have dazzled Broadway. Now the
latest in natty summer attire looked ready for the rag man.</p>

<p>Ham had produced the yell from Monk by the simple method of
jerking his thumb. The movement hurt Ham as much as it did Monk, but
he had expected it. However, he did not jerk again. It threatened to
sever his thumb.</p>

<p>Monk's little eyes glared at Ham. They were facing each other.
They had been compelled to do that for several hours. Also, they had
been sitting flat on the floor of the yacht's stateroom, with Monk's
short legs projecting alongside Ham's longer shanks. They could not
move from that position.</p>

<p>"Dangit all!" moaned Monk. "How much longer do you suppose this is
going to keep up?"</p>

<p>Before Ham could reply, Whitey Jano's benevolent voice spoke
again.</p>

<p>"As soon as we get the word, we will dispose of those two," he
said. "We shall not leave any traces for Doc Savage to discover. We
cannot leave shadows on water."</p>

<p>Monk shivered involuntarily. His long arms convulsed as if he
intended leaping into action. This time, it was Ham who howled.</p>

<p>"You offshoot of a gorilla! Don't do that! Keep those hairy thumbs
quiet!"</p>

<p>MONK grunted in a pleased manner. But torturing Ham wasn't giving
him a great deal of pleasure.</p>

<p>The furry, stubby thumbs of Monk were locked to the thumbs of Ham.
They were attached by the torturing contrivances known to the police
as thumbcuffs. These are employed sometimes in place of handcuffs in
the cases of extremely dangerous criminals.</p>

<p>The cuffs are fashioned in the manner of handcuffs. But they are
small and will lock two thumbs together. Inside each cuff are sharp
saw-edged teeth. Any pull against the links tightens these teeth.
They sink into the flesh. A prisoner would have to strip off all of
the flesh from the bones to tear himself free. Then probably he would
have to shave off a part of the bones.</p>

<p>The feet of Monk and Ham were free. But this did not give them a
chance to move around. Their captors had made certain they would stay
in one spot by a very simple device. They were sitting on the floor
facing each other.</p>

<p>And inside their arms, projecting from the floor to the ceiling of
the stateroom was an iron column. If his giant hands had been free,
the prodigious strength of the gorilla-like Monk might have wrenched
the iron stanchion from its place. But with his thumbs locked to
Ham's, the chemist was helpless as a baby.</p>

<p>"Monk," said Ham. "Did you get what that oily devil said?"</p>

<p>"Blast it! I don't care what he said! Wait till I get loose from
these danged things! I'm goin' to build a fire under that guy that'll
melt him into grease!"</p>

<p>"He said they couldn't leave any shadows on water," mused Ham. "I
was thinking about that shadow on the window."</p>

<p>"You dag-goned nut-brained mouth-piece!" squealed Monk. "Why'd you
hafta go an' think up something like that! I wonder if Doc has got
any line on all this crazy stuff?"</p>

<p>"It's been three or four hours now," said Ham. "Doc usually works
fast. Maybe they've got him, too."</p>

<p>"Dag-gonit! You would think of that!"</p>

<p>They heard some more of Whitey Jano's men enter the cabin. A thin
voice complained.</p>

<p>"But Whitey, you ain't expectin' us to go places on them crazy
camels? I tried ridin' a camel in a circus once, when I was a kid. I
ain't havin' any more of it."</p>

<p>Between crunching jaws, Whitey Jano said soothingly, "You'll ride
camels and like it. Take my word for it, Birdlegs, this is the
biggest split any crowd of nice boys ever had a chance at. There'll
be millions for everybody, and if you don't want to come back where
the hot seat's waiting for you, all of you can be big stuff."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" sneered the one called "Birdlegs." "An' the bigger you
are, the quicker some of them black devils'll be puttin' a knife
between your slats. I don't like it."</p>

<p>"I take it," said Ham to Monk, "Whitey's boys are about to take a
sea voyage for their health. And I'll bet they won't be comin' back.
It strikes me this Whitey has picked up better Arabian than you'd
expect a big-shot crook over here to know."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" groaned Monk. "They may be going on a
voyage for their health, but we're ticketed for a different kind of a
ride."</p>

<p>IN the cabin was a sudden commotion. A new man had arrived. He
spoke rapidly in Arabic. Ham picked out some of the words and pieced
them together. Like others of Doc Savage's group, the lawyer could
speak in almost any of the known languages. In fact, all of the group
employed an ancient Mayan tongue to communicate with each other in
the presence of enemies.</p>

<p>"Something's happened," Ham told Monk. "And Doc's got a line on
us. The fellow who just came in delivered an order from somebody he
called the All-Wise One. We're to be taken on that sea voyage. He
says the All-Wise One can use a chemist for a while. Monk, you do
have your uses at times."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities! What good'll I be on a sea voyage, if I ain't
got no thumbs!"</p>

<p>Ham's astute brain had been doing some fast conjecturing.</p>

<p>"I think I get the line-up, Monk. Whitey Jano somehow started a
feud between the Bedouins and the gunmen he had working for him. He's
got the gunmen so jammed with the police they have to lam out of New
York. When they've finished the job, whatever it is, on the other
side, it'll be just too bad for them."</p>

<p>"Then who's this All-Wise One?" questioned Monk.</p>

<p>"I'd say that's the leader of the Bedouins," advised Ham. "And
they're responsible for the shadow death, or whatever it is. I only
hope Doc gets here. Listen! Hear that, Monk?"</p>

<p>The sound that had startled Ham did not pertain to Doc Savage. The
clear, thin wail of a police siren shrilled across the bay. It came
from the direction of Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>"That's a police boat!" exclaimed Ham. "Maybe it means our finish,
but the cops have got a line on Whitey Jano!"</p>

<p>The same opinion prevailed inside the yacht's cabin. For the first
time, Whitey Jano ceased crunching popcorn to listen. The piping
voice of Runt Davis broke out.</p>

<p>"So we've gotta lam, huh? Too bad, chief, but it looks like you
made another mistake--and this time it's a real one!"</p>

<p>The ebony face of Hadith floated through the cabin doorway. The
outside wind stirred his kafieh. The blowing aside of the headcloth
revealed a ghastly truth. Both of the Nubian's ears had been sheared
off close to his head. In their places were unhealed, hideous
wounds.</p>

<p>Hadith halted inside, waiting impassively. The siren of the police
boat wailed louder. Undoubtedly, the harbor craft was making directly
for the secluded bay.</p>

<p>MONK and Ham pulled themselves painfully to their feet. Standing,
they could see through the stateroom window. The black fog lay thick
around the yacht.</p>

<p>"Look at that, Monk," directed Ham. "The masked devils again!"</p>

<p>Into the lights on the deck a number of tall figures moved
stiffly. Their dull, leaden faces under the eerie fog lights gave
them the appearance of dead men walking.</p>

<p>Two of the masked figures carried a wooden, cradlelike box between
them. They had attached a light, thin cable to something inside the
box. These men crouched in the shadows of the deck on the side which
the police boat was rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>A searchlight beam knifed from the bay. The water police aimed the
light at the black yacht. The beam rose and fell like a ghostly
finger, as the police boat lifted on the swells from the Sound. The
sea had been stirred by the inexplicable storms of the night.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squealed Monk. "They turned on the yacht
lights to bring the cops! It's a trap!"</p>

<p>"You're correct," said Ham. "They're deliberately planning to trap
that boat and murder its occupants. We've got to warn them."</p>

<p>The police boat glided closer. Its motor was cut down and ran with
a hissing sound.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ham. "Put that monkey voice of yours into the best
yell you've got."</p>

<p>Monk didn't take time to reply. He put all the power of his lungs
behind a screaming childish treble. Ham joined in with his own sharp,
piercing voice.</p>

<p>"Keep off! Keep off!" Monk and Ham shouted in unison. "It's a
trap! Keep off!"</p>

<p>The door of the stateroom slapped open. Monk and Ham, still
yelling in desperate cadence to warn the police, were helpless. Their
tortured thumbs held them to the iron stanchion. Whitey Jano's men
ripped out the vilest of oaths.</p>

<p>Reversed automatics were lifted. They crashed with skull-cracking
force on the heads of their helpless prisoners. Monk and Ham fell to
the floor. The devilish teeth of the thumb-cuffs gouged into the
flesh. Scarlet fluid oozed over their hands. But neither prisoner saw
this, nor felt what would have been searing pain.</p>

<p>They were unconscious. The cabin door closed behind the cursing
mobsters. A bolt grated in the lock.</p>

<p>FOUR harbor policemen in the boat had heard the cries of warning.
Unfortunately, they misinterpreted them.</p>

<p>"They're makin' a play for a getaway!" barked the sergeant in
command of the boat. "Turn the machine gun on them and start
shooting, if anything happens!"</p>

<p>He held the boat on a steady, gliding course toward the side of
the black yacht. The four water coppers did not see the globe lowered
to the surface of the water. It was the size of two footballs. Swung
to the end of a light cable, the globe was between the police boat
and the side of the black yacht.</p>

<p>Without sound a greenish, weird fire spread fanwise over the bay.
The air became filled with what seemed to be material particles that
were invisible. All of the men aboard the yacht, with the exception
of the masked figures, had crowded into the cabin.</p>

<p>The motor of the police boat suddenly roared. The machine gun
stuttered in one short blast and died out. The fast police boat did
not pause. Its increased speed shot it across the bow of the black
yacht.</p>

<p>One of the fog-piercing beams bathed it briefly against the
spreading greenish glow. The light played over the police boat from
stem to stern. It showed nothing but a boat, an empty, high-powered
boat dashing through the mixture of greenish glow and black fog
toward the rocks on the shore. The rocks were less than a hundred
yards away.</p>

<p>The police boat mushroomed itself on the first jagged reef. Its
speed caused it to completely hurdle the fangs that tore out its
bottom. The boat turned over, crashed, and lay on its side among the
rocks farther inshore. It was high and dry.</p>

<p>The globe emitting the greenish, horrible glowing swung at the end
of the thin cable. It was being drawn up. The cable slipped off. The
murder sphere plunged into the water. There was no hissing. Only the
splash.</p>

<p>ALMOST instantly, the whole bay seemed to explode into waves and
ripples of flame. Phosphorescent blaze rolled over the long swells.
Each ripple was converted into a running finger of green fire. But
there was no heat. The flame was cold.</p>

<p>The waves ran along and broke with blazing fury along the shore.
The black yacht was converted into a glowing ghost ship. The anchor
lifted and powerful motors throbbed. The yacht glided swiftly across
the blazing bay and headed into the black fog of Long Island
Sound.</p>

<p>Behind the vessel, the secluded harbor retained its brilliant,
blinding glow.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes after the black yacht had vanished, the
armored sedan of Doc Savage jolted at high speed along the rough road
leading to the hidden landing. The glow of the murder globe had given
the first definite direction of the black yacht.</p>

<p>The bay still retained the appearance of a lake of liquid fire. As
the sedan halted, the man of bronze leaped from the running board. He
seemed hardly to touch the ground, as he leaped over the rocks.</p>

<p>Wedged high in the rocks, he saw a shattered police boat.
Apparently there had been four men in the boat. The guns, other metal
objects and the buttons of the uniforms indicated this.</p>

<p>There were strange marks on one side of the wrecked boat. They
were the shadow pictures of legs. The legs of policemen who had stood
braced and ready to shoot down men they believed to be ruthless and
bloodless murderers.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII. THE BLACK YACHT SINKS</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE closed the telephone connection in his outer office. He
sat for one minute gazing thoughtfully at the chrome-steel door
behind which lay his library. Grouped within the library were Long
Tom, Renny, Johnny, Patricia Savage and Carson Dernall.</p>

<p>The man of bronze was making a rapid mental check of his own.
Though he was alone, the rare, exotic trilling came from his
motionless figure. This did not seem to be fashioned by his lips. It
was almost as if the keenly analytical brain itself were giving forth
the sound.</p>

<p>This indicated that Doc Savage was deeply stirred. Perhaps he had
come upon a startling discovery. For nearly half an hour he had been
talking over long-distance telephone to various places. Some of the
calls had been across the Atlantic. The man of bronze had conversed
with persons in England.</p>

<p>He opened the library door and announced, "Brothers, we are
leaving at once."</p>

<p>Patricia Savage frowned at her giant cousin. She was one of the
few persons who ever questioned Doc's decisions. Mostly only women
ever did that. Doc himself admitted he could not understand women.
Moreover, he did not trouble himself about it.</p>

<p>"But you'll have to wait, Doc," said Pat. Her frown only succeeded
in making her face more attractive. "I'll have to pack some
clothes."</p>

<p>"We are leaving at once," repeated Doc, quietly. "You will find
everything you require in the dirigible. I have been prepared for
such an emergency, should it arise."</p>

<p>"You think of everything, don't you, Doc?" said Pat with an
impudent smile. "I suppose you had expected some time to snatch me
out of my sleep for a dash to the Arctic."</p>

<p>Doc smiled and said nothing. His charming cousin indeed seemed
unprepared at the moment for a flight over the Atlantic. The negligee
she had been wearing had suffered in the brush. Her face was gouged
by thorns and was still somewhat dirty.</p>

<p>Pat had robed herself in one of Johnny's coats. Johnny was thin as
a skeleton and tall. The garment fell to Pat's small feet. She was
lacking one shoe.</p>

<p>"We are ready and we have no time to lose," stated Doc. "I have
learned the black yacht headed southward from the lower harbor."</p>

<p>The pallid Carson Dernall seemed to have partly recovered from his
experience. He spoke now.</p>

<p>"You will take me with you, Mr. Savage?"</p>

<p>The man of bronze studied the pale, fever-ravished face. The man
undoubtedly was sincere in wanting to become one of the party.</p>

<p>"Possibly we shall encounter some great dangers," Doc
suggested.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but you will," agreed Carson Dernall. "But I am
familiar with the region of the Syrian desert. Perhaps my knowledge
will be of value. That, however, is not my thought. Denton Cartheris
was my closest friend."</p>

<p>Doc merely inclined his head in agreement.</p>

<p>"Let us go," he said. "The fog has broken. It is my hope to
overhaul the black yacht. I believe Monk and Ham are still
alive."</p>

<p>Pat shrugged inside Johnny's long coat.</p>

<p>"For once, you have forgotten something, Doc," she smiled. "I am
supposed to be a chaperon, am I not? Yet you had said nothing about
Lady Fotheran."</p>

<p>"Lady Fotheran is now on her way to the dirigible hangar," advised
Doc. "She will be waiting."</p>

<p>"Which puts Cousin Pat right in her place," said Pat, whimsically.
"I might have known it."</p>

<p>NONE would have suspected the remarkable contents of the low,
shabby warehouse on the Hudson River shore. The dull building bore
only one sign. This was:</p>

<p>HIDALGO TRADING COMPANY</p>

<p>Shortly before noon, a long, silvery aircraft slid into view. It
took on the proportions of a streamlined dirigible. With its cabin
enclosed within the envelope, the airship appeared at a distance to
be as keenly pointed as a great arrow.</p>

<p>The dirigible proceeded directly down the bay and out to sea. At
the complicated instrument board of the radio, which included an
advanced television set, Johnny picked up ship after ship at sea. Doc
himself was at the controls.</p>

<p>Two hours after leaving New York harbor behind, Johnny let out an
exclamation.</p>

<p>"I've got it, Doc! One of the coastal steamers reports the black
yacht following the coast closely! Operator remarked it seemed to be
dangerously close, considering this swell after last night's
storm!"</p>

<p>The nose of the silver sliver veered slightly. The dirigible at
this moment was piercing a cloud bank. Doc Savage had held the ship
under the low ceiling for the purpose of scanning the ocean
surface.</p>

<p>Pat Savage was seated with Lady Fotheran. They were as beautiful a
pair of women as would ever be found together. Pat's golden eyes,
somewhat like those of her famous cousin, were almost duplicated by
the calm orbs of her companion. The only difference lay in the
quality of excited anticipation in Pat's, and the cool lack of
emotion in Lady Fotheran's.</p>

<p>"I do hope we rescue the two men who are missing," said Lady
Fotheran. "This is, all so terrible and I feel that I am
responsible."</p>

<p>"Doc and his men never feel any one but themselves responsible for
the dangers they face," assured Pat. "It's their life and they like
it. They choose to be adventurers, though any of them could be a
leader in his own profession. I firmly believe each one has only the
thought that death will end their association."</p>

<p>"Like my brothers, both of them," sighed Lady Fotheran. "Now one
is dead, and Ranyon--"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think about it," consoled Pat quickly. "Look! They
have sighted the black yacht!"</p>

<p>Pat made a little dash to the cabin window. Lady Fotheran moved to
her side. Below them, the long, narrow vessel looked like a toy boat
lashed by a gray sea. As the ship radio man had reported, the yacht
was hugging the shore dangerously.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they think they can escape any pursuit that way,"
declared Pat.</p>

<p>"But how can Mr. Savage possibly hope to reach them from up here?"
questioned Lady Fotheran. "There is no landing for the
dirigible."</p>

<p>"Leave it to Doc," said Pat, confidently. "Oh, I do believe that
yacht is going on the rocks!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" exclaimed Johnny. "Whoever's
piloting that boat is crazy! Doc, they're going to crack up!"</p>

<p>Lack of long words proved Johnny's excitement. It did appear as if
the black yacht was dashing straight upon the low reef of one of two
small islands near the shore. Heavy swells broke in foamy feathers of
foam almost under the black boat's bow.</p>

<p>"The pilot is not crazy, Johnny," said Doc, quietly. "There is no
pilot. If you will observe closely, you will notice the yacht is down
by the bow. It has been scuttled and we are too late, unless Monk and
Ham have been left aboard."</p>

<p>The others were amazed at the keenness of Doc's perception. But
now they could see the black yacht was sinking slowly. By some
miracle, the deserted vessel slid past the reef and into the deep
water outside one of the islands.</p>

<p>Doc's corded hands manipulated the dirigible controls, pointing
the streamlined nose downward at a sharp angle. He turned to
Renny.</p>

<p>"Take the ship," he said. "Hover over the yacht as closely as you
dare. I am going to board it, if possible."</p>

<p>But before Doc could carry out his plan, the sinking yacht was
caught by a heavy swell and crashed against the jutting teeth of the
reef. The back swell took her off again, and with a lunge, she headed
for the bottom.</p>

<p>Doc said nothing. He was only hoping--as were his companions--that
Ham and Monk were not aboard.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII. DEATH RIDES THE SKY</h2>

<p>"THE southern ship route should be clear of storms at this
season," announced Renny. "At Bermuda, we may learn something. I have
a hunch they would refuel at Bermuda."</p>

<p>"I had thought the same," stated Doc Savage. "We may hear some
news there of the planes. You said, Renny, the southern route should
be clear of storms. There is evidence of a black tempest somewhere
ahead."</p>

<p>Renny glanced quickly at the instruments. The barometer had not
changed. The dirigible was now riding close above slate-colored
clouds. These billowed like a rolling sea. The masses of vapor were
strangely stirred. But there was no evidence of a storm higher
up.</p>

<p>Johnny nodded his head sagely. He produced a few long words from
his unlimited vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Manifestly, we are about to undergo a repetition of last night's
inexplicable atmospheric convolutions," he put forth. "Observe the
contortions of the cirrulean strata."</p>

<p>"If you mean the funny way those clouds are twisting around, it
does look like we might be in for something," replied Renny. "Holy
cow! One minute ago the sun was shining, and what's this?"</p>

<p>He referred to the sudden darkening of a sky that had been
unclouded above them. They were holding at a height above where any
normal storm might be expected to break. Violent rains and winds are
commonly produced by the lower strata of clouds.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran said quietly to Patricia Savage, "I was afraid this
might happen. My brother, Ranyon, was correct in warning us of last
night's curious snowstorm. I am convinced that this Hadith has it in
his power to produce changes in weather."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really think that?" said Pat cheerfully, excitement
dancing in her golden eyes. "I've always wanted a chance to ride in
Doc's dirigible when there was a storm."</p>

<p>In her own way, Pat was as dauntless as her cool-nerved cousin.
Only, when there was real danger at hand, she expressed herself.
Anticipated enjoyment lightened her attractive face.</p>

<p>Though the darkness was increasing, Doc pointed ahead and to a
slightly higher level.</p>

<p>"They are traveling in five planes," he stated. "They are heavily
loaded and cannot equal our speed."</p>

<p>IT was several minutes before Doc's companions could pick out the
five distant dots in the swiftly darkening sky. In charting a route
to pick up Bermuda, the dirigible was rapidly overtaking the fleeing
Bedouins and the American crooks.</p>

<p>However, the visibility lessened so rapidly that the five flying
dots were quickly lost. The sun first was bathed in the red mist of a
wide halo. The mist had had much the appearance of blood across the
sky.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the solar light was wiped out. The clouds below
disappeared as if sprayed by an inky fog. The black fog of the
morning in New York could not be compared to the pall that swiftly
shrouded the silver sliver.</p>

<p>A blast of wind struck the ship with the force of a solid
blow.</p>

<p>The nose of the dirigible yawed widely. The craft bucked and
pitched into a vast air pocket. This was a vacuum in which there was
no supporting atmosphere.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall's pallid face immediately took on a greenish hue.
The vitality of the explorer had been sapped by fever germs in the
past. Apparently, he was easily made airsick.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran paled a little. She was watching Doc Savage
intently.</p>

<p>Pat Savage continued to smile a little. But her vivaciousness
suffered a temporary eclipse. The first plunge of the dirigible was
like dropping in Doc's high-speed elevator. Pat had tried that. It
always left her weak in the knees.</p>

<p>But this dive was much longer than the elevator's descent. The
ship was in a hole from which the air had been sucked away for more
than a mile beneath them. The darkness outside had taken on the
denseness of velvety soot.</p>

<p>The variety of instrument needles danced crazily. Compass, air
speed, barometer and radio-directional indicators lost their
usefulness. Johnny, at the radio, clapped his hands over his ears.
Something like an electrical fire ball had seemed to explode inside
his head.</p>

<p>"Hope the fins don't crack when we hit the wall!" boomed Renny.
"We're going to bounce!"</p>

<p>CARSON DERNALL stared at him. The explorer's tongue rubbed his
lips. Facing definite danger in the desert where you could put your
hands on an enemy, was something he understood. Being whipped through
the sky like the tail of a diving kite, was something you couldn't
put your hands on.</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll crash?" inquired Dernall, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"That is always a possibility," replied Doc Savage. "However, if
the pilots of the planes ahead can buck it, I believe we will
survive."</p>

<p>There came a sudden slowing and gripping of the dirigible. It was
as if the nose had rammed into a wall. Renny manipulated the fins and
fed fuel to the motors. He was picking up the airship the same as he
would have fought a skidding auto.</p>

<p>An ordinary dirigible would have been ripped apart. But this one
was of Doc Savage's design. It was outfitted with alloy motors
developed by Doc. With the help of the missing Monk, one of the
world's leading industrial chemists, the bronze man had devised a
synthetic inflation gas. This was noninflammable and had greater
lifting power than either helium or hydrogen.</p>

<p>Yet its superior design and power were stiffly overtaxed. The
instruments indicated nothing definite. All were strangely off. But
Doc estimated the ship now was fighting to hold a headway of perhaps
about twenty miles an hour. Greater speed was made impossible by the
wind of hurricane force.</p>

<p>The cabin being completely enclosed in the hull gave its occupants
an advantage. In front of Renny were charts and maps of the Middle
Atlantic Ocean and the upper African coast. These now were of no
service. The compasses had failed. They were flying blind, and the
direction might have been any of the four cardinal points.</p>

<p>LONG TOM relieved Johnny at the radio. Picking up steamers in the
swirling, mucky storm was for a time impossible. Some signals were
picked up. Apparently, these were being sent out by ships that were
on a comparatively calm sea. But the words were scrambled and
incoherent.</p>

<p>"I can't believe the planes could go through this stuff!" Renny
shouted to make himself heard.</p>

<p>The nearly soundproof cabin could not shut out the shrieking of
the storm. Lightning began stabbing the uncanny midnight darkness of
noontime.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," stated Doc; "I believe the planes are out of
the storm area. The pilots of the Bedouins would hardly risk their
own safety."</p>

<p>"You mean, Doc, you're thinking this storm is something
artificial?" queried Renny. "That maybe it's being made to bust us
up?"</p>

<p>"That is my conclusion," advised Doc.</p>

<p>Renny suddenly wrenched at the controls. His gloomy countenance
showed no change, but he spoke quickly in a low voice unusual for
him. He did not want his word to carry to the women and Dernall.</p>

<p>"One of the elevator fins is twisted," he said. "We're going
higher, but it won't respond to allow us to lose altitude."</p>

<p>The dirigible cabin had slanted sharply. The ship was wiggling
upward with a contorted motion.</p>

<p>The following half hour showed no lessening of the black tempest.
Lady Fotheran and Pat were becoming intensely airsick. The same
unpleasant malady had gripped Carson Dernall.</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll come through?" he inquired hoarsely of
Doc.</p>

<p>"Our ship is still intact," replied the man of bronze. "It is
capable of resisting great strain. However, it might be well, to have
our parachutes ready."</p>

<p>This last was an unusual admission from Doc. He seldom permitted
others to know his thoughts in extreme danger.</p>

<p>"If it's as bad as that," said Carson Dernall, "do you think it
would be possible for me to get through a radio message to be relayed
to New York? This trip was unexpected. My affairs would be left in a
tangled condition."</p>

<p>"You are welcome to make the attempt," stated Doc. "Perhaps our
messages might be received, where those of others could not reach
us."</p>

<p>Carson Dernall staggered with weakness as he got to the radio
seat. His bony hands were shaking. Evidently sickness and fear had
him in their grip. His eyes were bleak with the look of a man who
believes the next minute may be his last.</p>

<p>For some time he worked with the radio. He displayed thorough
familiarity with the various devices. One of his jobs in the desert
had been handling of the radio.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dernall announced he had succeeded in contacting a ship.
The others could catch squawking words from the loudspeaker.</p>

<p>Dernall was talking rapidly.</p>

<p>"This is Carson Dernall, aboard Doc Savage's dirigible adrift in a
storm at sea!" he announced, loudly. "Lady Sathyra Fotheran is with
me! I have a message to be relayed to New York, if possible!"</p>

<p>For three or four minutes, he spoke with staccato sharpness. His
words directed disposal of certain properties in event he failed to
survive. Pat Savage shivered a little. Her attractive face showed the
strain.</p>

<p>"He sounds like a man already dead and dictating his will," Pat
murmured.</p>

<p>None could be sure Carson Dernall's strange message had been
received. Scrambled words howled in the loudspeaker. Perhaps some
ship had really picked up the explorer's belated arrangement of his
personal affairs. If so, it would make a great story for the tabloids
in Manhattan.</p>

<p>The silver sliver continued its wild climbing. Renny's best effort
could not compensate for the twisted elevator fin. The others seemed
to be intact.</p>

<p>Ahead of the dirigible suddenly swam a light. It spread like a
slowly rising sun. The apparent phenomenon was quickly explained. The
sun really had appeared. The upper sky was clearing. The ship picked
up greater speed. At the time, it seemed as if the swift craft might
leave the earth's atmosphere and penetrate the stratosphere in its
wild dash directly toward the great orb of day.</p>

<p>Renny's hands experimented. The black tempest had passed almost as
quickly as it had arisen. Instruments swung back to normal. The ship
was considerably off the course that would carry it to Bermuda.
Resuming proper direction was simple, but the craft continued its
driving ascent.</p>

<p>"I've got it, Doc!" announced Renny. "If we could somehow get that
port fin jammed the other way, we could--"</p>

<p>The engineer ceased speaking. Doc Savage was no longer beside him.
The man of bronze had passed from the cabin without a word. His giant
body vanished through a door leading to the inner catwalk of the
ship.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE gripped his corded legs around a section of the
dirigible's alloy skeleton. This was the framework holding the fins
which controlled the a&euml;rial craft. The wind of the ship's
terrific speed tore at his giant body like the invisible hand of a
rushing monster.</p>

<p>The man of bronze hung head downward, his figure projecting into
space. The dirigible was now nearly four miles above the low clouds
concealing the Atlantic. Three persons inside the cabin were having
some difficulty breathing. Johnny relieved their distress by putting
the ship's special oxygen apparatus into operation.</p>

<p>At this altitude, the air had thinned out. Many persons arising
quickly to such an immense height are overcome. Doc's lungs expanded
and he breathed easily. Head downward, he swung like a pendulum in
the wind. His smoothly tendoned hands, with cords playing along the
wrists, fastened upon the twisted fin.</p>

<p>Doc pitted his mighty strength against the wind pressure and the
warped control of the fin. His jerking movements apprised Renny that
something was happening. Renny replied with a signal from the
controls. Slowly, bringing his muscles to rigid position, the man of
bronze reversed the direction of the sagging fin.</p>

<p>The nose of the dirigible pointed downward. Doc had no means at
hand to bind the fin in its changed position. His legs locked more
firmly. His head projected into the tearing wind. The bronze body
became as inert as some metal part of the ship. Holding thus, with
the sheer strength of his arms, Doc held the dirigible on its
descending course.</p>

<p>No other living man could have continued in that position for more
than a minute. It is doubtful if any other four men would have had
the strength to have moved the fin in the fierce blast of cyclonic
speed.</p>

<p>Doc Savage was still holding the elevator in place as the
dirigible slowed, circled and descended at Bermuda.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran's somewhat inscrutable eyes did not leave the figure
of the bronze man as the landing was made. She was looking at a
living man who, with his bare hands, had literally pulled his own
speeding dirigible out of the sky.</p>

<p>"It is entirely incredible," muttered Carson Dernall.</p>

<p>The explorer's face had resumed somewhat of its more normal
pallor.</p>

<p>RENNY descended into the crowd of wondering tourists who had
witnessed the remarkable feat of Doc Savage. The engineer ignored
thrusting hands and a flood of inquiries. In a few minutes, he had
returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Five heavily loaded planes refueled here more than an hour ago,"
he imparted. "They are carrying the Bedouins and some of Whitey
Jano's men. The Bermuda police refused them permission to enter the
town. They didn't like their looks."</p>

<p>"Probably we will not now overtake them," stated Doc, "We will
take a direct route to the northern African coast. There is a
venerable man in the city of Amman, I wish to see."</p>

<p>"You are going to Amman?" said Carson Dernall. "Yes, that would be
the place to obtain information. It will be possible there to get
animals and supplies for a caravan into the lower Syrian desert."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" put in Renny. "You mean we've got to ride camels? I'll
ride most anything, but I don't like the queer motions of those
desert ships. They make me sick."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love to go places on a camel!" declared Pal Savage,
exuberantly. "I never did."</p>

<p>"It's a dubious pleasure I fear will be denied you this time,
Pat," stated Doc Savage. "We shall proceed in the dirigible."</p>

<p>"Landings may be difficult," said Carson Dernall.</p>

<p>"We will find some," said the man of bronze. "If Monk and Ham
happen to have survived, I want to find them quickly."</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. CROSS-EYED BEGGAR</h2>

<p>HAIFID, the Syrian, was a venerable bag of skin and bones. His
beak of a nose was a meatless sharp bone which gave him the
appearance of a living mummy. His eyes were sunken black pools which
betrayed little emotion. He sat cross-legged on the rug of his
baked-earthen hut.</p>

<p>Haifid spoke in purest English, though this was not necessary. Doc
Savage and Johnny sat facing him. In deference to custom and lack of
chairs, the famed adventurers also were hunched cross-legged.</p>

<p>"I fear I must advise you will be tempting powers of such vast
evil as to make even your renowned resources helpless against them,"
stated Haifid. "Wise men of great courage have passed through Amman.
Some have gone in the direction of this Valley of Tasus. And some
went seeking this mystic hidden city of Tasunan. Denton Cartheris was
the last who visited Amman. He has not returned."</p>

<p>"Your advice is well spoken," stated Doc Savage, who well knew the
diplomacy with which information must be extracted from the venerable
Syrian. "We will give it heed. Yet we have a mission which must be
performed. We might discover something of great importance. And if
two of my own men have not perished in the sea, they perhaps will be
in the Valley of Tasus."</p>

<p>Haifid inclined his head on his leathery, scrawny string of a
neck.</p>

<p>"The Renowned One has been of great service to my people in the
past. I will impart to you all that I know of the Valley of Tasus.
The fate of all men is in the hands of Allah. It is spoken among the
people of the hills in whispers. The Nubian known as Hadith, slave to
the sheik of sheiks, is reported to have revived the shadows of death
and caused them to resume walking across the desert."</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. He listened patiently. Haifid, the
Syrian, would speak at elaborate length. Only in his own way would he
divulge information which would be valuable to the rescue expedition
aboard the dirigible. The man of bronze had the ability to understand
and conform to the manners of all peoples. When in Syria, he became a
Syrian by speech and action.</p>

<p>Haifid often invoked the blessings of Allah, the Prophet, as he
related his fabulous tale of the hidden city of Tasunan. With this he
told of recent rumors of enormous treasure discovered in ancient
tombs of the Valley of Tasus.</p>

<p>"There has even been formed at Alleppo a company of wealthy
personages willing to finance and co&ouml;perate with reputed
discoverers of this treasure," said Haifid. "However, these rich men
have thus far been unable to ascertain with whom they should deal in
the proposed development. I repeat, there is great mystery and an
aura of evil beyond the hills in the Valley of Tasus. Those who enter
do not return."</p>

<p>JOHNNY was less patient than Doc. The famed archeologist was eager
to be stirring about the city of Amman in the little time at his
disposal while the dirigible was being refueled and equipped at the
direction of Renny and Long Tom.</p>

<p>Aside from its ancient interest, Amman was one of the few small
paradises of the Syrian desert. It had green trees and streams and
fountains for the refreshment of caravans after long, hot journeys.
The prophecy that Amman would become "a desolate heap, no more
remembered" had fortunately never been fulfilled.</p>

<p>The busy capital of Transjordania, the city was under British
supervision. From a modern Oriental palace floated the green flag of
Islam on Amman's highest hill.</p>

<p>Johnny left Doc Savage with Haifid, as he wandered forth. The bony
scholar attracted almost as much attention as had the ultra-modern
dirigible of the man of bronze. The gleaming, streamlined ship formed
a contrast with the dusty camel ships-of-the-desert that covered
thousands of years of time.</p>

<p>IN the meantime, Patricia Savage had accompanied Lady Fotheran and
Carson Dernall on a walking tour of the beautiful, ancient city.
Their adventure might be intriguing to the vivacious, beautiful Pat.
But she was a woman and quaint shops were filled with lovely silks
and various Oriental oddities. Pat was not overlooking the chance to
return with some of these for her Park Avenue beauty shop.</p>

<p>"If there were not so much tragedy, I could really enjoy all
this," said Lady Fotheran, as they passed into a narrow lane where
the outlines of mosques and tall minarets could be seen against the
sun. "It really is beautiful."</p>

<p>"But for the Occidental it is a dangerous beauty," supplied Carson
Dernall who seemed determined to take a gloomy outlook of Doc's plan
to enter the lower desert with the dirigible. "I would advise you not
to become separated at any time, and not to go far from the main
business thoroughfares."</p>

<p>Patricia laughed at his forebodings. Then her attractive face was
briefly saddened.</p>

<p>"If we could only feel that Monk and Ham were still alive," she
said. "And oh, forgive me, Lady Fotheran--if your brother is safe. If
he is all right, don't worry, though, Doc will find him."</p>

<p>"I have come to believe Mr. Savage can accomplish anything,"
declared Carson Dernall. "Remember my advice: Don't separate. I have
some business to attend to and I'll see you again at the dirigible.
It is getting late. Stay together. Darkness comes quickly."</p>

<p>The sun dropped rapidly. In the clear air of the desert the
minarets of Amman became stark, pointing fingers. The chill of night
was close now. The torrid heat of day was changing swiftly into the
almost frosty breath of darkness.</p>

<p>Pat lingered a moment before an open stall in which Oriental rugs
were displayed. She sighed. Doc probably would frown upon her coming
back with a truckload of purchases. Besides, there was no time. Doc
had announced they would depart as soon as he had interviewed his
venerable friend, Haifid.</p>

<p>Glancing up, Pat noticed Lady Fotheran had strolled ahead. She had
passed around the corner of a baked-clay building, a few yards away.
Pat started to follow.</p>

<p>The beggar sitting at the corner was the most hideous object in
human form Pat had ever seen. His shrunken body supported arms that
lacked all flesh. His sunken eyes were turned upon her sightlessly.
Pat was repelled, and yet she was fascinated. She paused, watching
the beggar for a moment with utter loathing, yet seeming unable to
move.</p>

<p>The beggar mumbled in Arabic. Pat's hand sought her purse. She
dropped several pieces of sliver into the outstretched hand of burned
skin. Then she turned to hurry onward. The beggar cried out quickly,
as if in appreciation of her generosity.</p>

<p>The words were in one of the Bedouin tongues of the hills.
Unfortunately, Pat did not understand any of the words, except the
inevitable "Allah."</p>

<p>Pat shivered a little at her close contact with such a horrible
creature and hurried around the corner in the direction taken by Lady
Fotheran. If she had looked back, she would have seen the hideous
beggar arise with remarkable agility for his appearance. He lifted
one hand. His arm was as thin as a stick.</p>

<p>Three Bedouins, clad in the plainest of abbas and kafiehs,
appeared as if by magic from the wall of the narrow street. They
glided toward the corner where Pat Savage had disappeared.</p>

<p>Around this corner, Pat halted abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why, she couldn't have gone so far in that short time," she
murmured, with a little clutch of fear in her throat.</p>

<p>Lady Fotheran had vanished. It hardly seemed possible. This narrow
alleyway ahead had no intersections for at least a hundred yards.
There were no shops, and the flat doors set in the long, low walls
gave them a blank appearance. Lady Fotheran certainly could not have
traversed the length of this gloomy lane since she had separated from
Pat.</p>

<p>Pat hurried ahead. She was too much akin to Doc Savage to betray
nervousness. But she was woman enough to experience an apprehensive
chill over the mystery. Something drew her glance behind her. Three
shadowy Bedouins were gliding toward her.</p>

<p>Pat hastened her steps. The Bedouins seemed contented to remain at
a respectful distance. Suddenly, there was a faint cry. It was the
unmistakable voice of Lady Fotheran.</p>

<p>Pat halted, trying to fix the direction. The cry had seemed to
come from one of the closed, mysterious doors.</p>

<p>Then Pat saw one door which was open a few inches. She went toward
it. Her hand had sought her purse as she moved. Now she had the
slightly comforting feel of her small, but efficient, automatic.</p>

<p>"Lady Fotheran!" she called. "Are you in there?"</p>

<p>Pat watched the partly opened door intently, ready for instant
action. Thus she did not see another flat door open directly behind
her. Her first awareness of this came when a greasy hand was clamped
over her mouth, stifling any outcry.</p>

<p>Sinewy fingers enwrapped the wrist of the hand holding the
automatic. Burning pain followed nerves to Pat's brain. The pistol
fell from numbed fingers. The ruthless hands pulled her from the
lane. She was forced through the door and it closed.</p>

<p>As soon as her tongue was freed, Pat demanded, "What is it you
want with me? Is this a holdup?"</p>

<p>The voice of half a dozen men gobbled. Two Bedouins were binding
Pat's arms behind her. Another was examining her small automatic with
profound interest. He ended by sticking it into the belt around his
gumbaz. But none made a reply to her question.</p>

<p>"If this is a robbery, take what I have and let me go," said Pat.
"Otherwise, you'll have a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not so much trouble," spoke a perfectly modulated voice
from an inner door. "It is a pleasure we should meet again."</p>

<p>Though he now wore no honor ribbon and was clad in the native
costume of the desert, the man bowed elaborately.</p>

<p>"And this time, Kassan is making no mistakes," he said.</p>

<p>Pat was rendered speechless for a moment. The Mr. Kassan who had
kidnaped her from a Manhattan hotel, was among the last persons Pat
had expected to meet in Amman. In fact, Doc had learned no planes had
landed here. The bronze man had believed Hadith's Bedouins and Whitey
Jano's mobsters had flown straight for their goal in the desert.</p>

<p>This was partly true, but Mr. Kassan had arrived by other means in
Amman.</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for this!" snapped Pat, as soon as she recovered
her breath. Then, in spite of her own situation, she asked quickly,
"You know about two of Doc's men who were prisoners. We feared they
went down in the yacht that sank."</p>

<p>"Your concern would seem to be justified," said Mr. Kassan in slow
provocation. "There was little time to worry over adding weight to
our planes. Perhaps they were forgotten."</p>

<p>"My time will come, Mr. Kassan," promised Pat, fire in her eyes,
"and when it does, you'll regret everything you've said and
done!"</p>

<p>"I shall endeavor to make sure the time doesn't come," bowed Mr.
Kassan, politely. "For the present, we will prepare for a little
journey."</p>

<p>Light shone from an inner room. It bathed the doorway with the
mellow luminance of an oil lamp. Another individual stepped into the
light.</p>

<p>"You!" gasped Pat. "Why--"</p>

<p>A hand was clamped over her mouth. The sweetish odor of chloroform
permeated her nostrils. Slowly the fingers and the mellow light faded
from Pat's vision.</p>

<p>"AFTER only about twenty minutes, I went back by the way I had
come, hoping to meet Lady Fotheran and Miss Savage," said Carson
Dernall, gloomily. "I thought they had returned to the dirigible. But
I saw a beggar I recognized. The fellow was with that black devil,
Hadith, near the Tasus Valley."</p>

<p>"We will divide and make a thorough search," announced Doc Savage.
"The first one learning news of importance will return here and sound
the alarm."</p>

<p>Doc and his companions, with Carson Dernall, were beside the
dirigible. The a&euml;rial craft was equipped with a mellow whistle
operated by compressed air. It had been devised by Doc for the
summoning of others in danger or announcement of the ship's
presence.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall's bony hands were shaking.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were responsible," he said. "I shouldn't have left
them for a moment. But I didn't believe any of Hadith's men would be
in Amman. I will accompany you, Mr. Savage. I know many of the
citizens here."</p>

<p>Dernall was forced to take rapid steps, to almost run to keep pace
with the man of bronze. Seldom had Doc Savage been so stirred. He was
blaming himself for having summoned Pat to assist in this
adventure.</p>

<p>The unrelieved darkness of a narrow lane enclosed them. Dernall
directed Doc toward the spot where he had seen the beggar.</p>

<p>"It was here at this corner," said the explorer. "He was a hideous
object. And the two women were coming this way when I left them."</p>

<p>The beggar had vanished. The long walls with their flat doors were
closed and silent. Doc flicked on his generator flashlight. Its ray
struck upon a small, glittering object. The shine was like brilliant
light inside a drop of blood.</p>

<p>The bronze man retrieved this. The object was a ruby of vivid
fire. The setting was attached to a small gold link. Doc identified
it as having been torn from Pat's earring. He believed Pat had
deliberately torn the stone from its setting and dropped it. This was
what Pat had done.</p>

<p>Doc whipped over to the nearest door. The ears of Dernall were not
sharp enough to hear the vague rustling in the shadows near by. Nor
were his eyes keen enough to pick out the difference in the shadows
themselves.</p>

<p>The explorer started to exclaim, as he was swung from his
feet.</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," Doc whispered. "I'll be right with you."</p>

<p>The edge of the flat roofs of the baked-clay buildings was nearly
fifteen feet above them. Dernall felt himself projected into space.
He was thrown upward as easily as a light stick of wood might have
been tossed. He alighted with a slight crash on his hands and knees
on the roof of the building.</p>

<p>But Doc Savage did not follow. He whirled to the other side of the
lane. The rustling shadows darted toward the spot from which the
sound on the roof had come. The man of bronze flexed his knees only a
trifle. His body was hurled upward without sound. Hands gripped the
edge of the roof on the building opposite that where Dernall had
alighted.</p>

<p>Hoarse whispers in Arabic came distinctly to his ears.</p>

<p>Doc took a small glass globule from one of his pockets. The narrow
lane with its enclosed walls was an ideal place for use of the
chemical gas producing unconsciousness. Doc flicked the globule
downward, heard its slight tinkle. He backed slightly away from the
edge of the roof.</p>

<p>A dozen hands materialized suddenly out of the darkness behind the
bronze figure. Intent on the alley, Doc had failed to note the
presence of the soft-footed Arabs crouched on the roof. They had
waited until he had turned.</p>

<p>ONE corded bronze arm swept two men into space. They fell into the
alleyway with hoarse grunts. But hands were clinging to every
possible portion of Doc's body. Blows were rained upon his head.</p>

<p>Doc realized he was outnumbered. He expected to feel the thrust of
a knife into his throat. With a hissing breath, he dropped flat on
his face and lay still.</p>

<p>"It is enough!" rapped a voice in Arabic. "He will be out for
sufficient time!"</p>

<p>The many hands released their holds. In the dark lane below, a
number of cloaked figures lay as if they had decided to go to sleep.
They would be unconscious for an hour or more. The feet of the Arabs
scuttled from the roof.</p>

<p>Doc Savage pulled himself into a crouch. His head had not suffered
seriously. The bare bronze head should have been stained with blood.
If the attackers had been more observing, they would have noted
something queer about the impact of their clubs.</p>

<p>An astonishing thing happened. Doc seemed to lift off all of his
hair. One hand rubbed a bruised spot on his head. Then he replaced
what appeared to be a tight bronze wig. It was much more valuable
than a wig.</p>

<p>The device had been perfected by Doc, after having been wounded by
a bullet. It was a head-fitting skullcap of the toughest metal alloy.
Bullets could but only glance off it. The blows he had received had
been jarring, but they had been insufficient to stun him.</p>

<p>Doc had understood the Bedouins' words. They had said he would be
out for sufficient time. There was only one guess as to the meaning.
Pat Savage and Lady Fotheran were being taken away. The Arabs had
sought only to prevent a close pursuit.</p>

<p>For some mysterious reason, they had not used a knife. The man of
bronze believed he knew that reason. Native police had assigned
themselves to guard the bronze man's dirigible. They were fascinated
by the streamlined, shining craft of the sky.</p>

<p>And Doc knew there was aboard the dirigible one object that the
mysterious chief behind both Hadith and Whitey Jano wanted greatly to
get into his own possession.</p>

<p>Crouching, Doc listened intently for a few seconds. None stirred
in the alleyway below. The man of bronze could see the edge of the
building roof on which he had tossed Dernall so lightly. Nothing
moved there.</p>

<p>Through the darkness came a mellow, trilling whistle. Doc had
whimsically tuned the alarm of the dirigible with the rare trilling
that emanated from him in moments of deep concentration or of extreme
danger. The dirigible whistle, however, was pitched much louder.</p>

<p>One of the others had received news of Lady Fotheran and Pat.</p>

<p>Doc launched himself into space. It was perhaps twenty feet to the
opposite roof. Doc landed on it lightly, without sound.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall lay in a crumpled heap at the very edge of the
building. Apparently, he had been peering down into the alleyway when
the gas capsule had been crushed. Doc could have administered a
remedy that would have restored the explorer to consciousness.
Instead, he took a quicker method.</p>

<p>He picked up the bony form, holding Dernall lightly across his
shoulders. With gliding movement, he went swiftly across the roofs in
the direction of the dirigible. Doc did not descend into the narrow
lanes at any point. The body of Carson Dernall did not impede his
progress in the slightest. Spaces of nearly twenty feet were covered
in a bound.</p>

<p>Renny was too excited on his own account to question the reason
for Dernall's condition, as Doc deposited him in the ship.</p>

<p>"This old fellow, Haifid, came along," said Renny. "He knows
everything that goes on in the whole town, I guess. He said two white
women were taken away by caravan at sundown. Says there were two
bunches of those black devils grabbed Pat and Lady Fotheran."</p>

<p>"You mean they were not taken away together?" questioned Doc.
"That would make our task somewhat more difficult. One caravan might
be easily located, even at night with the infra-red beam."</p>

<p>"That's it," affirmed Renny. "Old Haifid said there were two herds
of camels, or whatever you call 'em. One, he thinks, went south and
the other east."</p>

<p>"That might be only a trick; probably is," stated Doc. "They
figured we would get the report. Later, the caravans will be united.
I think we're safe in heading for the Valley of Tasus."</p>

<p>WITHIN five minutes, the silvery ship flashed upward into the
night. Except for the lights on the instrument board, the dirigible
now carried no illumination. As Amman's white mosques faded from
beneath them, Doc switched off all luminance on the board.</p>

<p>"All put on the infra-red goggles," he directed. "We must see all
that moves. There are many caravans in the vicinity. In some manner
we must locate Pat and Lady Fotheran before we descend, or we will be
wasting much time."</p>

<p>The man of bronze held the dirigible to slow speed, cruising
slowly only about two hundred yards from the desert floor. In the
moonless night--it being one when the moon would arise near
midnight--the a&euml;rial craft would be invisible from the
ground.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall revived, groaning. He sat up, blinking at the
figure of Doc Savage outlined in the control window.</p>

<p>"How did we come here?" he questioned. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"That will keep until later," stated Doc. "We are trailing a
caravan which may be holding Lady Fotheran."</p>

<p>Doc swung the dirigible in a complete circle of Amman. Then he
headed southward. The speed was increased. Through the goggles, the
desert was filled with sharply outlined dunes and hills of lava rock.
Contrary to popular belief, only a part of the Arabian desert is of
sand.</p>

<p>"Look, Doc!" exclaimed Renny. "There you are! There are a dozen
horses, and I'd bet those are women tied on two of the camels!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was needless. Doc was already pointing the nose of
the dirigible toward the desert floor.</p>

<p>"Look!" ejaculated Johnny. "Something's happening! There's a big
bunch of riders coming over the hill!"</p>

<p>Rifles were outlined distinctly among this new group. Swiftly
riding Bedouins were coming up for an attack upon the caravan.</p>

<h2>Chapter XV. VANISHED RAIDERS</h2>

<p>"BE ready with the superfirers," instructed Doc. "Perhaps we
should intervene. Pat and Lady Fotheran will be endangered. I'll put
the ship down upon them. We have not been seen."</p>

<p>But the Bedouins below had heard the motors running. Doc had
slowed them to low speed. The raiding Bedouins suddenly drew up their
horses. Only a few low-lying dunes separated the two parties.</p>

<p>One of the camels of the Bedouins holding the women seemed to be
heavily laden. What appeared to be wooden crates hung on its sides in
the fashion of panniers.</p>

<p>Suddenly the camels carrying Pat and Lady Fotheran were running
with long clumsy strides across the desert. Other camels were dashing
away in another direction. Bedouins on horses with the caravan also
were fleeing.</p>

<p>But two mounted riders remained. They were beside the heavily
burdened camel.</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny had thrust their bodies through apertures
especially prepared for this purpose. Each held an automatic
superfirer loaded with mercy bullets.</p>

<p>"Hold your fire," directed Doc, abruptly. "Something is about to
happen."</p>

<p>The dirigible leveled off. It floated only a hundred yards above
the drama being enacted below. The two Bedouin riders were driving
the laden camel toward the party of raiders over the dunes.</p>

<p>The loaded beast ran with a queer, loping movement. Being a male
camel, the animal squealed with rage at being thus driven. But it
moved faster.</p>

<p>"Look at that," grunted Renny. "Now those two fellows are turning
and running way!"</p>

<p>This was true. The pair of Bedouin camel drivers looked as if they
had suddenly decided to give up their job. They were speeding their
horses after their disappearing companions.</p>

<p>The squealing camel with its jouncing panniers dashed on toward
the now halted raiders.</p>

<p>"Maybe the caravan has some treasure and would rather surrender it
than fight," suggested Long Tom.</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. He was missing no detail of the scene
below. Too late, the surprised Bedouin raiders turned their horses.
The laden camel was among them.</p>

<p>The squeals of the enraged beast died out. The animal seemed to
dissolve suddenly. One instant it was there, running away, and the
next there was nothing.</p>

<p>Light exploded across the desert floor. Greenish, ghostly
luminance was cast over miles of desolate dunes and rocks. The
greatest glowing, the focal point, was in the area where the raiders
had halted and the laden camel had vanished.</p>

<p>LONG TOM was sitting beside the radio controls. He emitted a
pained howl and toppled to the floor of the cabin.</p>

<p>Carson Dernall tore at the metallic goggles over his eyes with
frantic hands. His bony body quivered, as if he had been strapped
into an electric chair. The goggles crashed to the floor and the
explorer sat down with a bewildered expression.</p>

<p>Renny swore and Johnny pushed himself back and dropped the
superfirer.</p>

<p>Only Doc appeared unaffected.</p>

<p>"Only light electrical shocks," he advised. "Not strong enough to
be dangerous."</p>

<p>All metal parts of the dirigible were electrified. Defying Doc's
efforts, the craft shot upward. It was completely out of control.</p>

<p>"Something seems to have given the air more solidity," stated Doc.
"The gas has taken on triple lifting force."</p>

<p>The long silver arrow shot skyward. The greenish luminance lay
across the desert like a veil of gauze. This extended for the
distance of two square miles. The light possessed an eerie quality of
being material. Invisible particles filled the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" growled Renny. "The Arabs and their horses have all
stopped where they are! They haven't moved!"</p>

<p>Carson Dernall made his way weakly toward a window. He looked
downward.</p>

<p>"The shadows," he whispered, huskily. "I'm afraid anything you can
do to help Miss Savage and Lady Fotheran will be too late."</p>

<p>The horses of the Bedouin raiders were like ghost animals. They
had suddenly been carved into illusive statues. The dirigible
continued its freakish climb. The motors had become sluggish. Doc
could not procure enough power to overcome the increased buoyancy of
the gas.</p>

<p>"Could you not permit some of the gas to escape and let us get
down?" inquired Carson Dernall.</p>

<p>"I could," stated Doc. "But there are other means of landing. Long
Tom, you take the controls. Renny and Johnny, we'll try the
parachute. This calls for an immediate investigation. Would you care
to accompany us, Mr. Dernall?"</p>

<p>The explorer shook his head negatively. His bony face
shivered.</p>

<p>"I'll have to admit my nerve fails me when I think of jumping with
a parachute," he stated. "I'll have to plead some trouble with my
heart as the result of fever. The shock probably would put me out.
I'll stay with Long Tom, but I seriously advise you not to drop down
there, Mr. Savage."</p>

<p>DOC already was buckled into his parachute. Renny and Johnny were
likewise ready. The solemn countenance of Renny took on a funereal
aspect. At last, he was to be given the chance for some action. His
melancholy look was his expression of keenest enjoyment.</p>

<p>Johnny said, "Doc, we're more than a mile up and still climbing.
We'll maybe miss the spot if we go higher."</p>

<p>Long Tom, at the controls, was being guided by the widespread glow
on the desert floor.</p>

<p>"I'll hold the ship as closely over the place as I can," he
stated. "I am getting a little more power. Shall I descend as soon as
possible?"</p>

<p>"Catch us with the searchlight beam, as soon as you can get down,"
advised Doc. "By that time, we may be prepared to come back aboard.
But there are some things we should know before we proceed."</p>

<p>THE man of bronze was first to push off into more than a mile of
space. Control of his body enabled him to drop feet-foremost for more
than three thousand feet. Renny and Johnny were tumbling end over
end. None pulled his parachute ring until the desert was leaping up
to meet them.</p>

<p>The silk spread in the last thousand feet. They were deposited on
the desert far beyond the rim of the greenish glow. Doc led the way
through the lava rocks and across the dunes. Their arrival at the
scene of the Bedouins' annihilation was delayed for several minutes,
as they covered more than a mile of rough going.</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" rasped Renny. "I've been in some tough spots and
I've seen queer things, but this makes me feel as if cold water was
being poured on my neck! I don't like this!"</p>

<p>"I'll be superamalgamated!" exclaimed Johnny. "Your sensation of
frigidity is irrefutably nonillusionary!"</p>

<p>"That's right," stated Doc. "It's snowing."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" gritted Renny, rubbing one huge hand across the back
of his neck. "That's what it is! I thought for a minute I was getting
the jitters as bad as that fellow Dernall, when you invited him to
jump."</p>

<p>Big, cold flakes of snow were floating down. They were melting on
the back of Renny's neck. The snow was rapidly becoming thicker. Each
of millions of falling flakes took on the glowing of a firefly. The
supernatural snowstorm in the desert, where even rain was almost
unknown, became a sea of dancing flame.</p>

<p>"We have reached the place," advised Doc.</p>

<p>Renny's big feet kicked into a heap of metal. Saddle trappings and
bridle gear clinked with gruesome significance. Doc and his men were
standing in the midst of grotesque shadows that seemed to dance on
the desert, as the snowflakes laid a shroud over them.</p>

<p>Here and there were small heaps of guns, knives and other metallic
objects which had been the property of the raiding Bedouins. The
ungainly shadow of a camel with a stretching neck was in the middle
of these.</p>

<p>The quality of the snow set their skins tingling. But the glow was
slowly dying out.</p>

<p>The storm was thicker. High in the sky, Long Tom had switched on a
searchlight beam. It showed the dirigible was slowly descending.</p>

<p>Doc pressed the lever on the end of a short cylinder. Lurid red
flame mushroomed. The flash would guide Long Tom to their
position.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, across the sky flared another great blaze.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. THE DIRIGIBLE DISSOLVES</h2>

<p>THOUGH the heat retained from the torrid sun of the day caused the
snow to melt rapidly, the flakes fell so fast they piled several
inches deep. The storm was even more freakish than that which had
given Manhattan a blizzardy taste of winter in July.</p>

<p>But Doc Savage, Renny and Johnny were no longer concerned with
this astounding phenomenon. Their gaze was fixed upon the catastrophe
high in the sky. The world's most modern dirigible had burst into
flame!</p>

<p>"The thing couldn't happen," muttered Renny in a dazed voice.
"Thunderation, Doc. That gas won't burn!"</p>

<p>Doc was standing as motionless as one of the ghostly Bedouin
shadows.</p>

<p>"The gas isn't burning, Renny," he stated. "The fire started with
an explosion inside. Haifid's warning was well intended. Brothers, we
are opposed by forces such as we never before encountered."</p>

<p>Johnny laid aside his verbal cloak of long words. His scholarly
face was sharp with sudden grief.</p>

<p>"Long Tom? He couldn't--Doc, he wouldn't have had time to bail
out!"</p>

<p>"We shall have to ascertain that," stated Doc.</p>

<p>The dirigible was a falling mass of flames. Its descent indicated
the special bulkheaded envelope of noncombustible gas had been
pierced in many places. The spot where it would hit apparently was
more than two miles away.</p>

<p>The man of bronze led the others in that direction. They were
unable to keep pace with his flowing speed. Soon Renny and Johnny
could no longer see Doc. They blundered through snow, sand and lava
rock, guided by the falling blaze of the a&euml;rial craft.</p>

<p>LONG TOM had been attempting to put the searchlight beam upon Doc
and the others. The motors ceased their sluggish action. They were
hitting efficiently. The special propellers were powerful enough to
overcome the lifting force of the gas.</p>

<p>Long Tom headed toward the desert floor. The infra-red beam was
rendered useless. The thickly falling snow showed queerly as a
blinding mass of flaked soot in the goggles. Long Tom pulled off the
clumsy glasses and used the searchlight.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Long Tom was enveloped in a rushing blast. The explosion
was inside the cabin. He was hurled from the controls. Stunned, as
blazing tongues licked at him like serpents writhing in the air, Long
Tom sought a parachute.</p>

<p>The electrician cried out, "Dernall! Grab a parachute! It's our
only chance!"</p>

<p>He received no reply. The interior of the ship was rapidly
becoming an inferno. The flame was brilliantly blinding. Then came
another explosion, ripping out one whole chunk of the supporting
envelope. The dirigible was plunging downward.</p>

<p>The dirigible was dropping by the nose. Long Tom felt as if he
were falling into a deep black hole. Then he groped toward a
hatchway.</p>

<p>Of Carson Dernall, there was no sign. The explorer had been near
the middle of the cabin when the explosion came.</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE saw his supposedly fireproof dirigible disintegrate.
Metal parts were raining down with the snow. These were being
scattered over a wide area. Only the keen senses of the man of bronze
saved him from being crushed to the ground.</p>

<p>The object hurtling down upon him from space would have ground him
into the lava rock. This was one of the heavy alloy motors. The force
of its impact buried it deeply in the soft stone.</p>

<p>Doc Savage halted. From his body emanated the rare, exotic
trilling. The bronze man crouched flat, merging with the desert
floor. He had seen the shadows of riders scurrying swiftly away over
near-by sand dunes.</p>

<p>When Renny and Johnny arrived, Doc was holding an object in his
hands. It was one of the superfiring pistols. The frame had been
warped by intense heat. The cartridges of mercy bullets had been
exploded.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exclaimed Renny in an awed tone. "You don't suppose
Long Tom was using that? Who could he have been fighting?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the pistol was discharged by the fire," advised Doc.
"We will seek farther."</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny joined in the search with saddened hearts. The
warped pistol was the one Long Tom had always carried under his arm.
They called out several times, circling all of the area over which
parts of the wrecked dirigible were scattered.</p>

<p>They received no response. After several minutes, the three
adventurers converged on one spot.</p>

<p>"Did you find any trace, Doc?" asked Renny.</p>

<p>"There was nothing," said the man of bronze, sadly. "The heat was
so great it melted nearly everything. I found no sign of either Long
Tom or Carson Dernall."</p>

<p>Doc Savage took their minds from the tragic absorption. The man of
bronze had come upon a curious flat container of dull metal. This had
the shape of a thin crate and was about six feet in length. While it
had been marked by the fierce blaze of the dirigible, it was still
entire.</p>

<p>Doc straightened and looked across the low hills. The snowfall had
suddenly ceased. A reddish globe was rising in the east. The late
moon had a bloody face, as if it was emerging from a bath of scarlet
fire.</p>

<p>Again the exotic trilling was emitted by the bronze man. Now it
was a rare, tuneless running of the scale. It had the elusive cadence
of falling water murmuring in some deep cave.</p>

<p>Here there was drifted sand. Doc's bronze hands scooped out a hole
several feet in depth. He pushed the flat alloy container into this
and covered it deeply. With a few flat lava rocks, he marked the
spot.</p>

<p>The near-by, low-lying hills were whitened by the clinging, wet
snow. They stood out under the rising moon like the flat screens on
which moving pictures are thrown. But the figures now moving across
them were real.</p>

<p>They were trooping riders. They rode with the easy swaying only
attained by the Bedouin horseman of the desert.</p>

<p>"It will be well for each of us to mark this spot," advised Doc.
"Whatever happens, here is buried the most important evidence we have
come upon."</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny were impressed with the apparent evidence buried
in the alloy container. But they were also watching the distant
riders against the hills. This distraction was almost immediately
exposed as a trick. From three directions close by, mounted men
rushed upon them.</p>

<p>UNUSUAL for Arabs, these Bedu were attacking in silence. Their
usual method was to make as much noise as possible. The attackers did
not discharge their rifles. These remained in their saddle
scabbards.</p>

<p>Plunging horses were being driven directly upon Doc and his men.
Renny was knocked to the sand with a bellowing cry. The big engineer
went down with the superfirer in his hand. The machine pistol erupted
a steady line of flame. It sounded like the continuous twanging of
the strings of a harp.</p>

<p>Two riders howled and fell from their running horses. They struck
and their bodies rolled like sacks.</p>

<p>Johnny's tall figure darted between the riders. His superfirer
hummed. Mercy bullets whanged into men and horses. For a moment,
there was a confusion of fallen riders. But the number of Bedouins
was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Doc's voice came to Renny and Johnny. The man of bronze spoke in
the language of the ancient Mayans. This was understood only by Doc
and his adventurers. They had learned it in the hidden valley of
Central America from which Doc Savage's unlimited wealth
originated.</p>

<p>"Cease firing, to save yourselves," was Doc's strange command.
"Otherwise, you may become shadows like many others."</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny obeyed the order, wonderingly. Bedouins
surrounded them quickly. The cloaked riders massed around and cords
of camel's hair encircled their bodies. Slip nooses were drawn and
the pair found themselves being lifted helplessly to the backs of
horses.</p>

<p>Their eyes searched for Doc Savage. After he had spoken, the man
of bronze had mysteriously faded from among the dancing horses.</p>

<p>The Bedouins were cursing wildly in Arabic. Renny and Johnny
gasped as half a dozen riders suddenly separated from the others.
These six riders rode stiffly, as if clad in metallic armor. But
there was no clanking of metal joints. The six were driving a
riderless horse before them.</p>

<p>The red moon glow made the low hills stand out. The six riders
went swiftly toward one of these. Renny and Johnny had a brief
glimpse of their bronze leader. He was moving with unbelievable speed
toward the hill. Then he disappeared.</p>

<p>THE mass of Bedouins surrounding Renny and Johnny whipped their
horses away. They seemed to want to vacate that spot in haste.</p>

<p>Over by the low hill, the six riders who rode so stiffly swung
from their horses. Then they did an amazing thing. Whips cut down on
the flanks of the animals. They were starting the unmounted horses
away. The six riders remained beside the unmounted horse they had
been driving.</p>

<p>From what looked like a basket pannier on this horse rolled a
globe the size of two footballs. Renny swore bitterly.</p>

<p>"They've got Doc!" he groaned. "That's something he can't fight,
unless he uses the grenades!"</p>

<p>Renny referred to the high explosive carried by Doc for use in
only the most extreme danger. The engineer and Johnny held their
breaths, as they hoped for a mighty blast to wipe out the six
dismounted Bedouins.</p>

<p>No explosion came. The horses that had been whipped away had
stopped running. They were circling uncertainly.</p>

<p>A fiercely brilliant green light flashed over the hills. The
captors of Renny and Johnny lingered no longer. They were perhaps
half a mile away as the greenish glow spread over the desert. The
reddish moon took on a pale, sickly color. Invisible particles formed
a static tingling in the air.</p>

<p>As the glow reached its height, the six dismounted riders
approached the globe from which it emanated. The sphere of the shadow
death had ceased rolling. It lay like the great green eye of some
unhuman monster.</p>

<p>In the light, the faces of the six men had the color of dull lead.
They were like dead men who walked. Two men carried the long wooden
prongs. Another man carried a cradlelike box. With the prongs, the
glowing globe was rolled into this.</p>

<p>The phosphorescent glow still lay across the desert.</p>

<p>Talking among themselves, the six Bedouins in masks moved in a
widening circle around the spot where the death globe had been.</p>

<p>"What do you make of this?" exclaimed one. "It has been said this
Doc Savage carried many strange devices. Yet we find none of them.
There is nothing of metal remaining."</p>

<p>The masked men seemed greatly surprised. They hunted more
thoroughly about the space. They were rewarded only by the sand and
lava rock. Not even one metal button indicated where Doc Savage might
have been.</p>

<p>Clearly, the Bedouins were deeply mystified. With something of
fearful haste, they moved toward the horses they had whipped
away.</p>

<p>Here they halted, muttering deep imprecations.</p>

<p>There were now only five horses in the group. Apparently, the
sixth animal had continued on its wild dash across the desert.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII. VALLEY OF TASUS</h2>

<p>NEVER before during their careers as companions of Doc Savage had
Renny and Johnny been so deeply apprehensive. Their own plight as
prisoners of the Bedouins concerned them much less than the series of
disasters that had overtaken the man of bronze and the others.</p>

<p>Their belief in the invincible bronze man had always been too firm
to be shaken. The shadow death of the desert had been unnerving. The
destruction of the dirigible of itself was a mystery that had
incredible angles.</p>

<p>The dirigible had been constructed in every way to resist all
manner of fire. Yet the a&euml;rial craft had blazed to nothingness
in the space of a few minutes.</p>

<p>Toward daylight, the large party of Bedouins was conducting the
prisoners through a broken country. Hills of lava rock were jumbled
across the desert. There had been no indication of an oasis, yet the
Bedouin riders were heading for a definite goal.</p>

<p>Renny's and Johnny's arms had been bound, but their feet were free
in the stirrups. Armed Bedouins rode beside them. They made no
attempt to interrupt their occasional conversation.</p>

<p>Johnny said, "They're the riders with the shadow death. One of
them just said the All-Wise One will know what is to be done about
something."</p>

<p>Johnny's mastery of the Bedouin language was equal to that of any
of the Arabs.</p>

<p>WHEN the sun broke its first rays of torrid heat across the
desert, the prisoners saw the number of their captors was more than a
hundred. Some of the riders were too far back for their faces to be
distinguished.</p>

<p>A tall, ebony-faced Nubian was in command. This was the first time
Renny and Johnny had seen the former slave, Hadith; but they guessed
his identity. Six riders in the lead-colored masks rode up to
him.</p>

<p>Hadith waved his hands in significant gestures, as he uttered wild
imprecations. Apparently, he was displeased with these men.</p>

<p>"Looks like an earthquake makes this country its playground,"
asserted Renny, a little later.</p>

<p>They were riding a broken trail. Great hills of lava rock looked
as if they had been recently turned topsy-turvy. The desolation gave
no indication of a single caravan trail anywhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"You are manifestly correct," agreed Johnny. "The subterranean
strata of this neighborhood seems to be in a period of transition. I
don't recall any region of this character in the Syrian desert."</p>

<p>After two hours or more of winding through the contorted and
jumbled hills, the Bedouins entered a narrow pass. Hadith, riding a
snow-white Arabian horse, pulled up suddenly. From him came a shrill
whistling cry.</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Renny. "There's that green glow ahead!"</p>

<p>"Right," said Johnny, "and now it's beginning to fade out!"</p>

<p>The narrowness of the pass compelled the riders to proceed in
single file. The bright phosphorescence showed in the gap of the
hills. The sun was not high enough to reach into the pass.</p>

<p>At Hadith's signal, the glow diminished. Hadith held his Bedouins
for a few minutes. Then he gave the order to proceed.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "If this is the only pass and we're on
our way to the Valley of Tasus, it's an easy guess why those who go
in never come out!"</p>

<p>Shelves of lava rock flanked the pass. On these were a dozen
figures wearing the lead-colored masks. Very apparently the gap was
closely guarded. Its narrow confines formed a perfect death trap.</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny were unprepared for the amazing spectacle that
greeted them suddenly. It was as if they had passed by magic from the
barren desert to be confronted by one of the Biblical lands "flowing
with milk and honey."</p>

<p>Beyond perhaps a mile inside, where the desert continued, were
tall, waving date palms. These appeared to be the green guardians of
a vast area of gardens. The trees followed a peculiar
conformation.</p>

<p>From this spreading square of cultivated land, apparently well
watered, the palms extended in a single row for several miles over
rolling hills. And on either side of this green row the face of the
hills was composed of the lava rock and sand, dry and burning under
the morning sun.</p>

<p>"That's the big secret of the hidden city, the one Haifid called
Tasunan," announced Johnny. "That marks the course of a subterranean
river. And from the character of the hills and openings, that is the
location of the ancient tombs discovered by Denton Cartheris."</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" exclaimed Renny. "There really is a city!"</p>

<p>ABOUT two miles away, loomed a high, thick wall. Tall, spirelike
minarets glittered in the sun. And this wall was peopled by watchers.
The rarefied air of the desert revealed them as small, black
bugs.</p>

<p>The Bedouins crowded closely around Doc's men. They saw their own
destination was not the city.</p>

<p>"Looks like we've come upon the encampment of a whole army,"
stated Johnny.</p>

<p>More than two hundred tents occupied a flat, sandy space in the
strip of desert inside the barrier hills. It was like the encampment
affected by some reigning sheik of sheiks. Only it was quickly
apparent that this was ruled over by Hadith, the powerful black who
had been a Nubian slave.</p>

<p>Hadith's voice rang out in guttural command, as the Bedouins rode
up to the camp.</p>

<p>The Nubian was black as ebony. His color was in strange contrast
to the beautiful Arabian steed of white. The shoulders of his abba
were heavily embroidered with gold braid. At his belt hung the huge
scimitar with its glittering jeweled handle in its curved silver
scabbard.</p>

<p>Nothing of the slavelike humility lingered about Hadith. He rode
up with grinning confidence, as proud as a peacock displaying its
feathers. He was a warrior among warriors.</p>

<p>"Wellah!" he cried. "El Farengi!"</p>

<p>Despite their situation and the arduous ride of the night, Renny
and Johnny were hungry. Spicy, greasy odors of savory food assailed
their noses. This was the hour of early eating in the black
tents.</p>

<p>Slender bronzed women, with unveiled faces and clad in dusty
garments trailing in the sand, stared at the prisoners. Stark naked
children played before the smaller tents. The women were curious and
unashamed, unlike the Moslem women to be seen in Amman.</p>

<p>Bedouins unbound the prisoners' arms. Hadith rode up. He spoke in
English.</p>

<p>"You will be wise to accept the beneficence of Allah," he stated.
"For the present, you shall be dackhile in the black tents. Do not
attempt to escape, for there is no way."</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny knew that by "dackhile" he meant they would be
inviolate.</p>

<p>One of the Bedouins directed them toward a great, long tent.</p>

<p>This was a ninety-foot pavilion which faced away from the others
and toward the rising sun. This was the tent of Hadith. One end was
curtained off--the hareem, or place of the women.</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" grunted Renny. "I felt like I could eat a whole
cow, but now I'm not so hungry!"</p>

<p>Johnny made a wry grimace. He was perhaps even more fastidious
than Renny.</p>

<p>"Possibly we shall learn to engage in this primitive epicurean
pastime," he stated. "In other words, brother, we'll take it and like
it!"</p>

<p>A dozen Bedouins were crowding around a flat brass vessel. This
was fully five feet across. The Arabs were gorging themselves. They
were using man's original eating utensils, their hands.</p>

<p>In the middle of the brass platter the heads of sheep grinned with
ghastly bared teeth. Their ears were pulled back and flapping. A
greasy mixture flowed over the pile of food. Legs and ribs of mutton
floated on a sea of rice and gravy. The Bedouins scooped up their
food with their right hands.</p>

<p>All of the figures around the platter were wearing the customary
clothes of the desert.</p>

<p>Renny and Johnny moved forward with some hesitation.</p>

<p>"If I have to do it that way, then I'll have to," grunted Renny
with disgust. "Anyway, I've gotta eat."</p>

<p>A thin, sarcastic voice broke across the tent.</p>

<p>"Quit licking your fingers, you missing link! You ought to be able
to throw a ball of rice into that anthropoid aperture without
smearing gravy all over your nightshirt!"</p>

<p>"Blast it!" squeaked another voice. "Eatin' like a pig sure comes
natural to you! If I hafta eat another meal of this junk, I'll be
bleatin' like a lamb!"</p>

<p>"Gibbering like an ape, you mean!"</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" boomed Renny. "Johnny, do you hear that?' It's Monk
an' Ham! They didn't sink with the yacht, after all! Look at Monk in
all those funny clothes! With so much of him hid, he looks almost
human!"</p>

<p>LONG-WORDED Johnny surveyed the desert-garbed figures of Monk and
Ham.</p>

<p>"Indubitably," he put forth. "Yet I have a disturbing premonition
we have merely encountered confirmation of the theory of
reincarnation. These are but astral spirits in the guise of another
existence. Wouldn't Ham look sweet on Park Avenue in that
outfit?"</p>

<p>The apish figure of Monk came to its feet. His kafieh and abba
flapped wildly. One of his big feet splashed squarely into the
Bedouin breakfast. Rice and gravy slopped into the ascetic
countenance of the fastidious Ham.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities, Ham!" he squealed. "Doc's got here!"</p>

<p>"You awkward insect!" howled Ham, swabbing gravy from his lean
face. "Even if he has, that isn't keeping me from borrowing a knife
and carving you into spareribs!"</p>

<p>At a command from Hadith, the Bedouins were making room for Renny
and Johnny. Monk's apish form continued to perform a dance of
delight. Ham cleared his face and asked, "Where's Doc? How did that
black devil trap you?"</p>

<p>Before a reply could be made, a woman's scream rang out from one
of the small tents a short distance from the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Renny! Johnny!" the voice cried immediately.</p>

<p>They saw a slender figure running from the tent toward them. The
woman was clothed in the dusty, trailing garments. Her head was
closely hooded.</p>

<p>"It's Pat!" yelled Renny. "Holy cow! But I'm glad to know you are
all right!"</p>

<p>The big engineer mowed Bedouins to one side, making toward Doc's
fair cousin. Two men in kafiehs and abbas sprang toward the girl.</p>

<p>"No you don't, sister!" rapped one of these men. "Dames can't mix
with no men in this hangout! That's orders from the boss!"</p>

<p>The pair were marked by their speech and their faces for what they
were--the mobsters of Whitey Jano. The fact they were clad in flowing
kafiehs and abbas only added to their evil appearance.</p>

<p>One of the men slapped a greasy hand across Pat Savage's lovely
face. The blow knocked her heavily to the sand. Her feet had tangled
in the trailing robe as she fell. Pat attempted to rise.</p>

<p>The mobsters seized her arms and jerked her to her feet. From
Renny's giant chest came a roar like that of a maddened gorilla. A
Bedouin who got between him and the mobsters encountered a fist the
size of his own head. The Arab was turned so nearly over he alighted
squarely on top of his head.</p>

<p>Monk was nearly as quick as Renny.</p>

<p>"I'll eat out the gizzards of two of you anyway!" he howled. "I'll
twist your heads between your shoulders!"</p>

<p>The pair of mobsters saw the avalanche descending upon them. They
dropped Pat, pushing her roughly to the ground. One succeeded in
getting an automatic from the folds of his abba. The pistol blossomed
a stream of fire almost in Renny's face.</p>

<p>But the mobster was given no time to aim. Bullets plowed into
Hadith's pavilion tent. Two Bedouins groaned and slumped on their
faces. The impact of Renny's fist was almost as loud as the exploding
weapon.</p>

<p>The mobster's kafieh flew off. When he hit the ground, his head
rolled oddly as if his neck were only a rag. Seldom had Renny ever
hit a man with all of his great strength. No mobster's spine was ever
made to resist such a blow. The mobster quivered and lay still.</p>

<p>MONK'S long arm encircled the other of Pat's assailants. Bones
cracked with the dry snapping of sticks. The mobster fell to the sand
with blood bubbling from his lips. Monk's childlike voice was
squealing with jungle rage.</p>

<p>The big chemist selected the two nearest Bedouins. Though they had
been surprised, the Arabs were flashing long knives. Both Bedouins
struck at the same time, but they had failed to count on Monk's
apelike agility.</p>

<p>One knife sliced across his hairy cheek, but the Bedouins' skulls
cracked together under Monk's hands. Their knives fell to the ground.
Monk stooped and seized both of the weapons. He whirled toward the
big tent.</p>

<p>Renny was holding Pat Savage in the crook of one powerful arm.</p>

<p>"Thishahum, bism er rassoul!" rang the sharp command of
Hadith.</p>

<p>"Wellah! Wellah!" responded half a hundred throats.</p>

<p>Dark faces ringed in all four of Doc's men. The Bedouins kept a
respectful distance now, but a dozen or more had seized rifles. The
weapons were pointed.</p>

<p>Hadith leaped toward Renny and Pat Savage.</p>

<p>The heavy, curved scimitar played with a deadly whirling of light
around the Nubian's head. The Nubian face was wearing the glare of a
killer thirsty of blood.</p>

<p>Renny swept Pat behind him. Even his huge fists would be useless
against the swinging blade.</p>

<p>Ham and Johnny were standing now with four Bedouin rifles jammed
into their bodies. Again the Nubian's shout commanded his men to
kill. Renny dived suddenly in the fashion of a football tackler. The
scimitar was swishing downward.</p>

<p>A slow voice of authority interrupted. It was that of Whitey Jano.
He was speaking in Arabic.</p>

<p>"Enough, Hadith!" was the command. "The All-Wise One has decreed
these men shall live! For the present, they are of service to him!
Those who go against his will cannot escape his anger!"</p>

<p>Hadith's arm dropped. His big body was hurled backward.</p>

<p>But Renny and Monk were pinned to the ground by the massed rush of
Bedouins. Whitey Jano had saved their lives.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. STAND IN THE TOMBS</h2>

<p>MONK groaned and squirmed, trying to relieve the squeezing
pressure of the thongs that bound his arms behind him.</p>

<p>"Dang it!" he complained. "I've been tryin' to work 'em loose an'
they're gettin' tighter!"</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" growled Renny. "How long do you suppose those
black devils intend to leave these things on? I'm paralyzed from the
neck down!"</p>

<p>"Afraid you won't gain anything by fighting them," advised
Ham.</p>

<p>With Johnny, he had been bound with the others. Balked of his
desire to spill their blood on the desert, Hadith was using a device
which was rapidly appeasing his bloodthirsty soul.</p>

<p>The four men were fastened with their backs to stakes driven
deeply into the sand. The torrid sun flooded them with furnace heat.
Their faces had baked to the color of boiled lobsters. Even Monk's
furry hair could not protect his ugly countenance from the force of
the direct rays.</p>

<p>Adding a delicate touch of the punishment, Hadith had caused their
arms to be bound tightly in many wrappings of camel hide. The hide
had only recently been stripped and it was green. The sun was drying
the thongs, and as they dried they shortened.</p>

<p>The benevolent-appearing Whitey Jano had made no effort to
interfere with Hadith's idea of a good time. The mob leader from New
York seemed interested only in preserving the adventurers' lives at
the behest of the mysterious All-Wise One.</p>

<p>Whitey sat crosslegged in the shade of a black tent. He was
engaged in his favorite pastime, which the native Bedouins watched
with some awe. Perhaps he had brought a supply with him. For Whitey
was juggling popcorn into the air, catching and crunching it in his
white teeth.</p>

<p>Clad in the garb of the desert, with his snowy hair showing under
his kafieh, and his coal-black eyes beaming mildly in his swarthy
face, Whitey might indeed have passed for a sheik of sheiks.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" grunted Renny. "I think he saved our lives only so he
could have some fun!"</p>

<p>"No, it has been the order from this All-Wise One, as they call
him," imparted Ham. "They were ready to bump off Monk and me, and
something happened. I gather they are expecting to force us to aid
them soon. Listen to that!"</p>

<p>From the direction of the first entrance to the tombs came the
rattling of shots. They were so closely spaced as to identify the
racketing of a machine gun.</p>

<p>"If I've guessed it right," said Ham, "this Ranyon Cartheris is
holed up between the Bedouins and the main gates to the city of
Tasunan. For some reason, they cannot, or don't want to, use this
shadow death stuff close to the tombs themselves. Cartheris seems to
be well armed and to have plenty of ammunition. Besides that, he's
got control of a water supply and food from the gardens."</p>

<p>"Cartheris couldn't have many men, and they're all Arabs," said
Johnny. "So the Bedouins are planning to seize the city of
Tasunan?"</p>

<p>"That's the answer," supplied Ham. "I heard Whitey Jano saying the
All-Wise One intends to take possession of the city and enslave its
inhabitants. It seems they are a peaceful people without many
weapons, but they will fight if they're forced to it."</p>

<p>"And Ranyon Cartheris has been standing between them and the
city?" mused Johnny. "I get it now. That's why they grabbed off Lady
Fotheran and Pat Savage. They hope to get at Cartheris through his
sister. And just to make it good, they expect to keep Doc out of
their hair by using Pat as a hostage."</p>

<p>Rifles still cracked in the direction of the tombs. The machine
gun hammered spitefully and the rifle shots ceased.</p>

<p>A thudding explosion shook the ground. Bedouins screamed.</p>

<p>"Good boy!" exploded Renny. "This Cartheris guy has got some
pineapples! That's one reason the black devils aren't walkin'
in!"</p>

<p>THE afternoon had been well along when the four men were staked
out. The desert sun hit the rim of the hills. This eased the pressure
of the drying skin thongs a little. Shouts came from the vicinity of
the outer pass.</p>

<p>Hadith and a group of guards rode out. When they returned, they
were accompanied by an enormously fat man. He was of Syrian cast. His
face was rolled in swaths of superfluous flesh. A hawkish nose stuck
out strangely from the greasy countenance. His skin seemed to ooze
grease, or it was bathed in olive oil.</p>

<p>The Syrian had densely black eyes with hardly any pupils. His head
was partly bald and shining. He rode a skittish black horse with
inlaid saddle trappings. Two laden camels followed.</p>

<p>On one of the camels sat a dried-up specimen of the Ethiopian
race. The little black man was the Syrian man-of-all-work, valet,
camp tender, camel driver and general packer. In other words, he was
a slave. His gestures and vacuous expression told he was a mute.</p>

<p>"I am Duzun Kado," the Syrian told Hadith, waving his fat hands.
They were adorned with jeweled rings. "You will conduct me to your
master, in the name of Allah."</p>

<p>Hadith's piercing eyes flashed, but he was discreet. He guided the
intruding stranger to the tent of Whitey Jano. In Arabic, Hadith
imparted a low message of his own. Whitey Jano nodded his head. He
was most benevolent.</p>

<p>"I will learn of his mission before he sees the All-Wise One,"
stated Whitey. "If he comes from Alleppo, it is important."</p>

<p>The Syrian had caught the low words.</p>

<p>"I have come from Alleppo," he offered. "I am the humble servant
of the Seven Companies Syndicate. We are prepared to invest in the
Tasus treasure to one-third of its value and quantity, as we have
heard through Amman is the proposal of the All-Wise One."</p>

<p>Whitey Jano tossed popcorn in the air. He trapped it with his
strong teeth and crunched. His smile was benevolent.</p>

<p>"The Seven Companies Syndicate? The All-Wise One has heard of your
organization. Then you are aware one-third of the deposits and no
questions asked, with the stuff to be delivered outside, is the
proposal?"</p>

<p>"Of this we are aware." The Syrian inclined his head. His neck was
so corpulent this action was difficult. "Also, we have been informed
the amount required is enormous, eventually reaching a hundred
millions in gold."</p>

<p>"The sum is trivial," declared Whitey Jano. "Only that includes
noninterference. None of the Seven Companies men are to enter the
Valley of Tasus. The will of the All-Wise One must remain supreme
behind these hills."</p>

<p>"Of this we understand, and it is agreed," accepted Duzun Kado.
"My mission only is to assure us of what exists. If as represented,
we are ready. I have come with a binding payment."</p>

<p>A pudgy hand waved toward the camel packs. The beasts were
resting. The black slave mute had curled up in the shadow of one
animal. He was asleep.</p>

<p>"Wish I could hear what's going on?" put forth Renny.</p>

<p>"I am possessed of a premonition that dire happenings are
progressing toward a climactic conclusion," offered the big-worded
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" squealed Monk. "If you mean somethin's due to bust, I
wish it would bust! I ain't got no feelin' above my shoulders!"</p>

<p>"That doesn't come under the heading of news, you ape," grinned
Ham, painfully.</p>

<p>The lawyer was suffering as much as the others, but he couldn't
resist the shot.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano gestured to the fat Syrian. They moved into a tent,
out of earshot of the others.</p>

<p>FIGHTING near the tombs had ceased with the sudden desert
darkness. The night chill relieved the torture of the camel-skin
thongs. They stretched a little. In the early moonless darkness,
Doc's four adventurers could not see each other distinctly.</p>

<p>In the tent of Whitey Jano, flickering lights appeared. Duzun Kado
knew when to say nothing with Oriental diplomacy. Once he inquired
politely if it would be the will of the All-Wise One to deal with him
directly.</p>

<p>"Of that, we shall determine," replied Whitey Jano.</p>

<p>The American confidence sharper and leader of mobsters was more
and more taking on the cloak of a true Arabian in speech and action.
Only he continued his ceaseless, annoying crunching of popcorn.</p>

<p>A new figure glided into the tent. His dark features were
aristocratic in every detail. He bore himself with dignity.</p>

<p>"I am Kassan, personal aide to the All-Wise One," he announced.
"You come from the Seven Companies syndicate, at Alleppo?"</p>

<p>Duzun Kado repeated what he had told Whitey Jano. Kassan gave no
indication of being impressed with an offer of a hundred
millions.</p>

<p>"With tomorrow's sun, you will have the privilege of examining the
ancient city, which is called Tasunan," stated Kassan. "It is
understood there must be no interference with the present or later
affairs of the All-Wise One with respect to the city of Tasunan or
this valley."</p>

<p>"The lowly representative of the Seven Companies Syndicate is
discreet," bowed Duzun Kado. "The wishes of the true Sons of Islam
shall be respected."</p>

<p>Kassan's thin lips smiled.</p>

<p>"Then it will be well. You will rest in the tent of Hadith, and
the guard will be only for your protection."</p>

<p>Duzun Kado's fathomless black eyes were inky pools. They did not
betray any emotion. Well indeed, the Syrian understood he would be
closely guarded.</p>

<p>The black slave mute huddled a covering around him. His body was
pressed closer to the resting camel for warmth.</p>

<p>Doc's staked companions could see the shadows of the beasts. From
Hadith's pavilion tent came the savory odors of cooking.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" groaned Renny. "Aren't they goin' to feed us?"</p>

<p>"It ain't cow or any part of it," piped up Monk. "It's sheep
again. All they eat is sheep."</p>

<p>NEAR the staked prisoners, a shadow moved along the ground. There
came a queer scuffling. Some one was approaching the prisoners. He
was accomplishing this almost silently, by the simple method of
rolling.</p>

<p>From close beside the four listening captives came a hoarse, nasal
whisper.</p>

<p>"Keep your traps shut an' don't talk," the voice admonished. "All
you do is grab an earful of what I'm handin' out."</p>

<p>None of the four spoke. The thin body of a man jerked into
position in front of them. The figure sat up with a hissing sound of
pain. A small, bulletlike head bobbed up and down on a turtle
neck.</p>

<p>"I'm Runt Davis," the man announced. "I'm here because there ain't
any of us got a Chinaman's chance to get outta here. They've got the
finger on you guys, same as Whitey Jano's got our number up. We're
all framed for a rubout with that devilish picture fire. I gotta talk
to somebody."</p>

<p>Runt Davis was sweating, though the night was now chilly. He
lifted his right arm to mop his face. Then he swore bitterly. He kept
forgetting he hadn't any right hand. The bandaged arm was infected
and swollen enormously.</p>

<p>"We don't make any deals with rats," announced Ham. "But you've
got us where we can't avoid listening. So go ahead and spill your
woes."</p>

<p>"Ain't no time for splittin' hairs," croaked Runt Davis, huskily.
"You bein' with this Savage guy an' havin' a reputation ain't goin'
to win you nothun' in this deal. Whitey says they've bumped off the
big bronze mug. They're goin' to proposition you fellas."</p>

<p>"They'll be wastin' time," said Ham.</p>

<p>"Yeah? Well maybe. But all they want is what this guy called Monk
has got. This boss they call the All-Wise One is all set to grab off
this town over back of the big wall. Whitey brought us along with a
bunch of machine guns to help snatch the town. When that's done, he
has the sweet little idea of seein' we all get the picture bump, so
there won't be no split an' no squawkin'. I'm only one of a dozen
he's put on the spot."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" moaned Monk. "Whadda the black devils want
with me?"</p>

<p>"Plenty!" said Runt Davis. "There's only one way into the town.
It's through them old tombs an' under the ground along some kind of a
funny river. They've got to root this guy out that's in there now.
He's got a bunch of them suits that protects them from the picture
bump-offs."</p>

<p>"So that's the answer to Cartheris holdin' them off," commented
Renny.</p>

<p>"Yeah, an' even when they get through there they've gotta do a lot
of blasting their way into the town," supplied Runt Davis. "That's
where this Monk mug comes in. They've gotta bunch of chemical junk
for mixin' explosives, but the guy that was goin' to do it had a
run-in with Hadith and got himself chopped down."</p>

<p>"I ain't mixin' nothin' for nobody!" squealed Monk,
ungrammatically.</p>

<p>"For cryin' out loud, pipe down," hoarsely advised Runt Davis. "If
I'm caught here, it'll be just too bad. An' listen--"</p>

<p>"We're listening but that's all," said Ham.</p>

<p>Runt Davis went on quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm willin' to turn you fellas loose, if you'll give me an' the
other boys a break. Maybe we can burn our way out, an' maybe we
can't; but it's our only chance."</p>

<p>"You mentioned Whitey Jano saying they got Doc Savage?" said
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yeah; that was last night, as I get it. They rubbed out the big
bronze guy when they got you."</p>

<p>The thoughts of the four prisoners became deeply gloomy.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," declared Ham. "But, anyway, we'll--"</p>

<p>THE darkness spilled a sudden, flaring light. It was a torch of
wood drenched in oil. The thing was tossed almost upon Runt Davis.
The one-armed mobster leaped to his feet with a wild, rending cry. He
screamed profanely.</p>

<p>"It grieved me greatly to have come upon such ingratitude," spoke
a gentle, fatherly voice. "Seize him!"</p>

<p>Two springing Bedouins already had accomplished this simple feat.
Runt Davis ground out oaths and struck at them with the swollen stump
of his severed hand. The Bedouins held him firmly.</p>

<p>"I hope the men of Doc Savage are too intelligent to believe the
tale with which this mistaken boy has attempted to hoax you," said
Whitey Jano.</p>

<p>Whitey stood in the flare of the torch. His jaws crunched popcorn.
His countenance held an expression of deepest sorrow.</p>

<p>"Runt, my boy," he stated, "you have been extremely foolish. It is
true you have incurred the deadly enmity of Hadith. So you tried to
save yourself by involving others. It is too bad, too bad, my
boy."</p>

<p>"Don't, Whitey, don't talk like that!" screamed Runt Davis. "I
know what you mean--don't do it! Don't believe him, fellas! He's
only--"</p>

<p>Whitey Jano spread his hands. A Bedouin's hand was clamped over
Runt's slavering mouth.</p>

<p>"You see, he would not be advised," observed Whitey Jano,
resignedly. "And so this cannot be avoided."</p>

<p>Whitey Jano lifted one hand. He might have been conferring a
benediction upon his crippled aide. The hands of the Bedouins freed
Runt Davis. But they impelled him forcibly into the darkness.</p>

<p>There was a tall shadow there. The flare of the oil torch picked
up the gleam of a swishing circle. The ebony features of Hadith
jumped into view. Whitey Jano spilled some Arabic words. Hadith made
no reply.</p>

<p>"No! No!" screamed Runt Davis. "Whitey, I didn't mean it! I didn't
mean--"</p>

<p>Whitey tossed a bit of popcorn into the air. He caught it between
his teeth. There was a double crunch. One was of Whitey's jaws. The
other was accompanied by the vicious swishing of Hadith's jeweled
scimitar.</p>

<p>The headless body of Runt Davis staggered a full half dozen steps
before it fell. Blood spouted. The small, bullet-like head rolled in
the sand. The flare of the torch showed the glazing of the eyes.</p>

<p>"The will of the All-Wise One is something difficult to
understand," sighed Whitey Jano, sanctimoniously. "I deeply regret
the incident of this morning. Presently you will be freed, then we
will converse."</p>

<p>"If I ever get my hands on you, there won't be any conversation!"
squeaked Monk, his childlike voice quivering with the horror he
felt.</p>

<p>"An' that goes double!" roared the impulsive Renny. "That guy
might have been a rat, but you're lower than a snake!"</p>

<p>"I am greatly saddened," said Whitey Jano. "This was unfortunate,
but we shall not permit it to interfere with our future
friendliness."</p>

<p>The jaws still crunched as Whitey moved away. By his order, the
gruesome remains of Runt Davis were removed. Hadith had sheathed his
bloody scimitar, after carefully cleansing it in the sand. He came
over and inspected the imprisoning stakes. Then he went away.</p>

<p>FOR a few minutes, the four prisoners were speechless. They had
encountered many horrors. The cool, terrible execution of Runt Davis
had shaken them.</p>

<p>Finally, Renny said, "Do you think that poor little rat was
telling the truth about Doc?"</p>

<p>The replies of the others proved the added report of Doc's fate
had impressed them deeply.</p>

<p>"Still, I don't believe it," insisted Johnny. "Something went
haywire with that death-glow thing."</p>

<p>"But you'd think Doc would have found some way to get in, if he is
still alive," said Ham. "He would--Listen! What's that?"</p>

<p>For the second time, they heard a shuffling in the sand behind
them. All could see a few Bedouins not far away. None spoke. The
shuffling continued. Another man was approaching by the simple method
of rolling in the sand. His body was very small and light.</p>

<p>This the prisoners could not see. The man stayed behind them.
Renny was the first to become conscious of the fact that a knife had
slit the camel-skin thongs. His immense arms, fell inertly to his
sides. All feeling had been squeezed from them. The engineer's big
body seemed partly paralyzed.</p>

<p>Renny saw the others were being cut loose.</p>

<p>"Don't move yet, or speak," came a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Ham and the others had the same thought. The voice was American.
It must be one of Runt Davis's pals. Perhaps he was freeing them for
revenge. All believed Runt had told them the truth.</p>

<p>The four men sat motionless for the space of many minutes. They
stifled groans that wanted to break out with the fiery renewal of
circulation in their arms. The whisper came again.</p>

<p>"Scram for them hills above the tombs," it advised. "Make a wide
circle an' dodge the black devils watchin' the Cartheris bunch."</p>

<p>The sand shuffled. Their liberator was gone.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX. THE STAKED WOMAN</h2>

<p>"IF they'd only left me so much as one of them grenades, I'd feel
better," complained Monk.</p>

<p>"They stripped us, too," said Renny. "Somebody in that mess is
plenty smart. They even got the stuff outta my hair."</p>

<p>Renny referred to the substance with which Doc Savage's men could
write invisible messages on glass. These were of a chemical that
fluoresced under a specially devised ray.</p>

<p>The four men were crouching in the jumbled rocks of the hills
above the tombs. Voices of the Bedouins gobbled throughout the space
near the black tents. Small parties rode through the darkness with
flaring torches.</p>

<p>The cries indicated they had no hope of finding the escaped
prisoners. A thousand men could have hidden for days in the miles of
quake-tossed lava rock.</p>

<p>Doc's adventurers were free, but they were weaponless.</p>

<p>"And we can't last much longer without food and water," advised
Ham.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" exclaimed Johnny. "After the way
you and Monk were putting away mutton chops this morning! Renny and I
haven't had anything since yesterday."</p>

<p>"Anyway, we've got only one chance now," stated Ham. "Before
sunrise, we'll have to join up with this Ranyon Cartheris."</p>

<p>The idea was instantly approved. The carrying out of it was not so
easy. But after half an hour of crawling through the rocks above the
tombs, the four came out above a wide, yawning hole.</p>

<p>A party of Bedouins rode close by with a single torch. From the
hole came the sudden stuttering of a machine gun. A horse screamed
with pain. Two riders fell to the ground without screaming. The torch
was flung aside. The remaining Bedouins fled, leaving the bodies.</p>

<p>"Wait here," directed the waspish, agile Ham. "I'll try and reach
Cartheris."</p>

<p>Ham's slender figure reached the lip of the rocks above the
yawning entrance to the tombs. He could hear low-pitched voices below
him. He called out softly. The voices hushed.</p>

<p>"We are four Americans, the companions of Doc Savage!" stated
Ham.</p>

<p>"Look out!" exclaimed a Bedouin's voice below. "It's only a trick!
I was afraid the Bedu would get up there!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" commanded another voice. "The letter I sent my sister may
have brought results!"</p>

<p>Ham was quick-witted. His reply was based on the other's
words.</p>

<p>"It was the letter," he called out. "It told of the murder mirage
and how you lost your men in the desert. Lady Fotheran brought it to
Doc. Your sister is here, Cartheris. She was captured by Hadith and
his men along with Pat Savage, Doc's cousin."</p>

<p>"That is correct," said the voice below, but it was filled with
sudden, deep apprehension. "You say my sister is here, in this hell
hole?"</p>

<p>"She is," advised Ham. "We shall come down."</p>

<p>THE four adventurers exclaimed with amazement, when they were in
the entrance to the tombs. Ranyon Cartheris was a lean young man,
with a face worn thinner by fatigue and the hardships he had
undergone.</p>

<p>And the explorer who had set out to find the strange treasure
discovered by his brother had only six men with him. One was the
ancient, skinny Mahal mentioned in the letter, who was useless as a
fighting man.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" ejaculated Renny. "How've you been holding those
devils off?"</p>

<p>The little party of caravan survivors was sheltered behind a low
rock wall. The machine guns, with stacked drums of ammo, were set in
niches. But this was not all the defense.</p>

<p>Machine guns would hardly be effective against the rolling globes
of shadow death. Cartheris, by way of reply to Renny, produced a
rubbery-looking helmet of the color of dull lead. He pulled it over
his head. The mask fitted his face perfectly. The eyes were covered
by a transparent substance resembling mica.</p>

<p>"We wouldn't have lasted long if we hadn't discovered a plentiful
supply of these," said Cartheris. "And where do you suppose they were
found?"</p>

<p>"They would be in the mummy cases of a hitherto unannounced
ancient and vanished race," came the astounding announcement from
Johnny. "They were placed there with the body garments that resist
the murder glow. Perhaps this ancient race believed their dead would
be confronted by a similar danger in some other world."</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris gave a long, low whistle of amazement.</p>

<p>"No need for you to announce yourself as William Harper
Littlejohn," he said. "I've heard a great deal of you from my
brother. But your deduction savors of black magic."</p>

<p>"Not at all," disclaimed Johnny. "Simple enough. This murder glow
is some element unknown today. It has been lost. The suits of
metallic substance and the masks are some alloy that will resist it.
I suppose, of course, you have found the origin of the death
globes?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cartheris. "We have been too busy saving our own skins
to penetrate any farther into the diggings. Apparently a whole city,
an advanced civilization, was buried by an earthquake. Much of the
ruin is in mammoth caverns. But we've to stick here and hold off the
Bedouins. We have water and food. As long as our ammunition lasts, we
cannot be ousted."</p>

<p>EVEN then, events were being shaped to disprove the confidence of
Cartheris. It was in the intense darkness immediately preceding the
rising of the moon. A group of half a dozen Bedouins, commanded by
Hadith, were moving on foot.</p>

<p>At a distance of a hundred yards from the tombs' entrance, they
were invisible. Two of the Bedu gripped the arms of a slender woman.
A gagging cloth had been bound tightly between the woman's teeth. She
was propelled to within about one hundred yards of the tombs'
entrance. There she was flung flat on the ground.</p>

<p>In the walled hole with Ranyon Cartheris, Doc's men heard a sudden
thumping. It came from the opaqueness of the sandy barrens directly
in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>"The black fiends are up to something," said Cartheris. "I don't
like taking chance shots in the dark, but maybe a dose of lead from
one of the machine guns will break up their trick, whatever it
is."</p>

<p>Thump-thump-thump-thump!</p>

<p>The blows were muffled, but they were repeated rapidly. Ranyon
Cartheris slowly lowered the snout of a machine gun. Though there was
no visibility, it would be easy enough to locate the target by the
continuing sound.</p>

<p>The Bedouins holding the woman were hammering pointed stakes deep
into the sand. This was the cause of the thumping. When the first
stake was in, the slender wrist of the woman was bound to it with
thongs. Another stake was being placed at her feet.</p>

<p>Cartheris was an expert marksman. His ears were good. With
gripping fingers, he started the machine gun jolting. He was aiming
at the sound. After the first short burst, he loosened his hand to
listen.</p>

<p>Leaden slugs plowed up the sand. The bullets whipped grit and
particles into the eyes of the Bedouins. A white mobster with a
crooked mouth was with them. A slug bit into his ankle. They were
hitting short and whining over the woman only inches away.</p>

<p>"Hey, you chump!" yelled the white mobster. "Cut off that chopper
or you'll be makin' mincemeat outta your sister!"</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris gasped and swore. His hands fell nervelessly from
the machine gun.</p>

<p>"My sister! You don't suppose those fiends would try anything like
that!"</p>

<p>"From what I've seen of them," observed Ham, dryly, "they would
gouge the eyes out of a baby. Lady Fotheran was captured with Pat
Savage. The black devils have got an ace up their sleeve this time.
I'll bet that's why they took the trouble to bring her here
alive."</p>

<p>SWEAT of misery was pouring from Ranyon Cartheris's lean face.</p>

<p>"I'm going out there and get her!" he grated. "By the gods! They
may get me, but I'll take some of them along!"</p>

<p>The ancient Mahal was mumbling a prayer to Allah. He spoke:</p>

<p>"There is a time for applying great foresight before acting. We
are in the hands of Allah. Our enemies assail us with a temptation to
which they hope we will yield. Wait."</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris shouted in the direction of the stake
pounders.</p>

<p>"Curse all of you! We're coming with the guns! We'll burn you off
the face of the earth, you dirty scum!"</p>

<p>The voice of the mobster floated back mockingly.</p>

<p>"Sit on it, brother! The first move you make, the boys with one of
them shadow bump-off balls are all ready to do their stuff! Get the
big idea? All you're supposed to do is keep your shirt on till
daylight! Then you'll get your orders!"</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squealed Monk.</p>

<p>Cartheris shook as if gripped with the fever of the desert.</p>

<p>"Sathyra! Sathyra!" he called out. "Have they got you there?"</p>

<p>The gag must have been released for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"No! No!" came the strangled cry of a woman. "Don't come out!!
They wouldn't--"</p>

<p>The cry was abruptly choked off. The wailing note of the woman's
voice made it impossible for Cartheris to identify his sister.</p>

<p>But he said to those with him, "What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"When the question is propounded, that is the time when nothing
should be done until a logical solution is evolved," spoke the wise
voice of the shriveled Mahal. "I greatly fear, however, they have, as
the ferengi puts it, an ace up their sleeve."</p>

<p>Thump-thump-thump-thump!</p>

<p>The last stake was driven. The woman's arms were stretched by the
binding thongs around her wrists. Her slim body convulsed a few
times, then she lay still.</p>

<p>Cartheris and Doc's men were drawn to the flaring of two bright
torches. The brilliant light showed the woman on the ground. Her garb
was American. It was a yellow dress with silver trimmings.</p>

<p>"It's my sister," groaned Cartheris, burying his face in his
hands. "Why did I ever come on this crazy adventure? First Denton,
then Sathyra. I shall go out."</p>

<p>"We have until daylight," suggested the practical Johnny. "Perhaps
by then we can devise some plan."</p>

<p>"Blast it! Look!" exploded Monk. "There ain't much we can do!"</p>

<p>THE flaring torches had been for another purpose than merely that
of showing the woman. Four Bedouin riders came up and dismounted.
They wore the masks of dull lead. Two swung a wooden cradle to the
ground. This was placed alongside the woman.</p>

<p>"The death ball!" exclaimed Renny. "I guess they mean business,
all right!"</p>

<p>The horses were taken away. The four masked men remained. Then the
torches were extinguished.</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squeaked Monk. "How about us all taking
rifles when it comes daylight? We could make certain we were aiming
at all of them! Then we could all shoot at once!"</p>

<p>Cartheris shook his head.</p>

<p>"In addition to resisting the murder glow, the suits and masks are
absolutely bulletproof. We've been hit a dozen times without
injury."</p>

<p>"I recall that," said Ham. "I broke one of my swords on the stuff.
I thought it was some kind of armor."</p>

<p>The white men and the Arabs in the excavation became gloomily
silent. There seemed nothing they could do.</p>

<p>There was much Johnny wanted to know about the underground city of
this ancient civilization. But he refrained from questioning. Ranyon
Cartheris was sunk in his anxious grief for the fate of his
sister.</p>

<p>SHORTLY before sunrise, in the tent of Hadith, Duzun Kado was
awake. During the night, the fat Syrian had been a witness to the
execution of Runt Davis. His oily face had remained emotionless.</p>

<p>Afterward, Whitey Jano had entered the place where he slept,
accompanied by Kassan.</p>

<p>Duzun Kado then spoke after the custom of the country.</p>

<p>"My eyes have seen nothing," he announced, solemnly. He spoke on
in Arabic.</p>

<p>"Ana Bwajh el Beduw," he said, recalling to his hosts, "I am in
the face of all Bedouins, I am a dhaif in the black tents. I am
dackhile to you and all Bedouins."</p>

<p>Duzun Kado meant he was protected by sanctuary law, and that he
was inviolate to them all.</p>

<p>As an emissary of the Seven Companies Syndicate, he thus
established his position as a guest of the Bedouins. Even the wildest
robbers of the hills fear to violate the law of the dhaif. Kassan
appeared impressed.</p>

<p>"This violence has been unfortunate, Duzun Kado," he said. "Before
the heat of the sun strikes, we would have you ride with us toward
the city of Tasunan. In the dark hour, we will be ready."</p>

<p>Kassan himself, with a guard of Bedouins, guided the Syrian
representative from the black tents an hour before the sun struck its
light across the Valley of Tasus.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX. OUT OF THE TOMBS</h2>

<p>FIVE white men's faces were grimly set. Their jaws might have been
carved from marble. And the bony countenances of six Arabs might
equally have been struck from bronze.</p>

<p>Their hands gripped loaded rifles. The first strike of the sun
from the east found them set and ready. But the hands holding the
weapons were as powerless as if bound by rigid thongs.</p>

<p>The slender body of the woman lay stretched on the gritty sand
less than one hundred yards away. In a solemn row beside her sat four
figures as motionless as the rocks. Their faces were the hue of dead
men.</p>

<p>Close to the woman's head was a cradlelike box.</p>

<p>This was all. Four masked Bedouins and the woman. No: Three
Bedouins and one Whitey Jano mobster, the besieged men soon
discovered.</p>

<p>For one masked man arose and advanced, walking slowly. He did not
raise his hands as a signal for a truce. This was unnecessary.
Perhaps his crooked mouth was twisted into a mocking grin under his
mask.</p>

<p>The mobster knew he was safe from bullets. The death-glow armor
protected him. The body of the woman lying on the sand was an
additional safeguard.</p>

<p>Cartheris groaned, "Anyway, my sister is alive. I saw her
move."</p>

<p>The woman was writhing a little, seeking perhaps to relieve her
numbed limbs and body. The rising sun immediately became a blazing
fury. The throttling gag was causing the woman to gasp as she
breathed.</p>

<p>"O. K., you mugs!" snarled the masked mobster, when he was only a
few yards from the tomb stronghold. "Alla you are to slip outta them
monkey suits an' come walkin' out with your hands up! Be good boys,
an' nothin' happens, see? Start 'somethin', an' the dame'll be just
another one of them pictures! You've got five minutes to make up your
minds!"</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris was white-lipped. His lean face had the color of
gray chalk.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said to the others. "I'm going out there! The rest of
you stay here. She is my sister. I wouldn't want you to--"</p>

<p>"Aw, nuts!" growled Renny. "She might be my sister or somebody
else's, but what's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Any argument is futile," stated Johnny. "What goes for one of us,
goes for all. Those black devils wouldn't hesitate an instant to
annihilate Lady Fotheran."</p>

<p>"Perhaps all are wrong," spoke the calm voice of Mahal. "If we
should refuse to go, they would not destroy the woman, for she is
their means of persuasion."</p>

<p>"A wise thought, indeed, but I wouldn't want to risk it," said
Johnny. "By the way, Cartheris, why haven't they walked in on you
before this with the masked suits?"</p>

<p>Cartheris motioned toward two boxes. They contained nearly a
hundred high-explosive grenades.</p>

<p>"They tried it once yesterday," he stated. "The alloy suits
couldn't save them from that stuff. But we can't use that now."</p>

<p>"Hey!" yelled the mobster. "I'm waitin'! You've got two more
minutes!"</p>

<p>Renny let out a bull-like roar. The big engineer was on top of the
rocks. He was holding a pair of binoculars belonging to
Cartheris.</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" he bellowed. "She isn't Lady Fotheran! That's
Pat--Pat Savage! They'd murder her and they've still got Lady
Fotheran! Come on! I'm smashin' those devils, armor or no armor!"</p>

<p>RENNY was on his way before he quit shouting. Monk was scrambling
after him!</p>

<p>"Alla you come on out!" yelled the mobster in the mask. "Don't try
no tricks! Behave yourself, an' this All-Wise guy gives the word
nobody won't be hurt!"</p>

<p>"That rather changes the idea of who should go," stated Johnny,
starting to follow Renny and Monk. "It's Doc's cousin. Your sister
apparently is safe in the tents."</p>

<p>"It changes nothing," declared Cartheris. "Mahal, all of us must
go."</p>

<p>"You have spoken truth," assented the ancient Bedouin. "It is the
will of Allah!"</p>

<p>Cartheris and the Bedouins with him followed Doc's men into the
open. Renny and Monk disregarded the masked mobster and ran toward
the staked woman on the sand. All coming from the entrance to the
tombs were unarmed. Cartheris and his Arabs held up their hands as
they ran.</p>

<p>The three masked Bedouins beside the woman arose. One held the
cradlelike box, as if prepared to empty the death globe beside the
head of Pat Savage.</p>

<p>Cartheris preceded his Arabs. The tribesmen were delayed in their
movement by the infirmities of the aged Mahal. Suddenly, from the
rocks of the hill came a ringing shout. The tall figure of Hadith
appeared. His jeweled scimitar flashed in the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>"Thishahum, bism er rassoul!" his cry echoed along the hill.</p>

<p>Another shout came in Arabic. It meant, "Kill the dogs of the
unfaithful!"</p>

<p>A dozen rifles belched flame and smoke from among the rocks.</p>

<p>The ancient, loyal Mahal was the first to go down. He fell on his
face. His last cry to Allah was a faint wail. The other tribesmen
faltered in their stride.</p>

<p>One fell; then another. All became huddled lumps. Their white
abbas were reddening with blood.</p>

<p>No bullets touched any of the white men.</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris turned, gripping futile fists over his head.</p>

<p>"Curse all of you!" he screamed, as if he were temporarily insane.
"Kill me, too! Do you hear? Shoot! Well, why don't you shoot?"</p>

<p>Monk squealed his rage. Renny thundered oaths at Hadith's
blood-thirsty Bedouins. For the minute, all expected to be shot
down.</p>

<p>"That's all!" snarled the masked mobster. "I knowed them fellas
was goin' to get it! The All-Wise guy ain't got no use for the black
ones that ain't on the up an' up! Now everybody just sit tight an'
everything's goin' to be all right!"</p>

<p>RENNY and Monk had hurled themselves forward. Each a giant in
strength in his own way, they tore the stakes binding Pat from the
sand. Hadith's Bedouins came rushing down the hill. Hadith was
shouting orders.</p>

<p>Renny tore the gag from Pat's mouth. Her flaky gold eyes, like
those of Doc Savage, tried to smile at him. But Pat's lips were
quivering. It wasn't the first time Pat had been close to death. But
being left as a permanent shadow on the desert was a possibility that
had shaken her nerve.</p>

<p>Hadith's Arabs ringed the white men with rifle muzzles. When Pat
was on her feet, supported by Renny and the apish Monk, none made any
resistance. The inevitable camel-skin thongs drew their arms behind
them.</p>

<p>Hadith snapped out an order. The little procession moved back in
the direction of the tombs. Pat Savage was taken along.</p>

<p>The Bedouins paused only to seize the rifles and machine guns and
pass them out to others who had come up. Then the prisoners were led
down a long, sloping stone pathway.</p>

<p>The cold, dank odor of death was wafted from within the earth
under the rocky hills.</p>

<p>As they went, Johnny took one last swift glance to try and fix
their position. The geologist noted they were starting downward in a
line with the peculiar conformation of the date palm trees.</p>

<p>Hadith jabbered to his men. They were jubilant. The underground
passageway had been cleared for the attack on Tasunan.</p>

<p>THE mute black slave of Duzun Kado hovered like a shadow at his
master's side. His ears might have been stopped to all sound and his
voice stilled, but his queerly opaque black eyes seemed to miss
nothing. Duzun Kado halted the others when they were a mile or more
underground.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano and Kassan, with a guard of a dozen Bedouins trailing
them, had accompanied them into the bowels of the earth. After his
view of the city of Tasunan, the Syrian representative of the Seven
Companies Syndicate was to have a view of the treasure. A treasure
for which he had declared the Seven Companies Syndicate was willing
eventually to pay a hundred millions for a one-third interest.</p>

<p>After the manner of his kind, Duzun Kado spoke elaborately.</p>

<p>"We have put to the test the small specimen we received," he
stated. "Though it is no more than two grams, its power was
sufficient to make the radioactivity of radium seem of little
strength. And our report declares more than five hundred pounds
actually are in existence."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is more, and it might be a little less," replied
Kassan. "These ancient Tasunites, as we have designated them, have
scattered some of it. Apparently, many of the race remained alive
after the city was buried and became a partly subterranean
civilization. They then employed it to defend themselves from their
enemies."</p>

<p>"In what manner might that have been accomplished?" inquired the
Syrian, rubbing his fat hands together with pleasure.</p>

<p>"The walls of this passage, for example, are capable of striking
the shadow death whenever those who know the secret choose to release
this power," said Kassan. "Where we are now passing, we could cease
to exist, were certain levers to be operated in the central chamber
to which we are proceeding."</p>

<p>"This is indeed of the greatest interest," intoned the Syrian.
"And is there now any person in the central chamber?"</p>

<p>A benevolent smirk came to Whitey Jano's round mouth. As usual,
his jaws crunched popcorn. Between crunches, he spoke.</p>

<p>"Even now, the levers of the death shadow are prepared," he said,
slowly. "But our worthy guest need have no fear. This is but to
strike in the ancient death chamber of the Tasunans. The place of
their executions. It is filled with shadows of generations. And we,
too, must at times dispose of our enemies."</p>

<p>The fat Syrian rubbed his hands appreciatively. Evidence he had
the cruel, cunning soul of an Oriental seemed positive. But he spoke
at once of other things.</p>

<p>"There exist many passages on different levels," he said. "Is
there purpose in this, or am I presuming too much?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no!" smiled Whitey Jano, lapsing for once into straight
Americanese. Then he explained more, at length, in Arabic.</p>

<p>"WE are in the passage of the shadow death and at its end are the
execution chamber, the storage chamber and the place from which the
defense shadow death of the walls is operated. The tunnel we have
passed leads downward. At a hundred feet below this one, it traverses
under the gardens. Its exit is in the central square of the modern
city of Tasunan. There are many other passages. Some reach remaining
buildings of the ancient city."</p>

<p>Torches of the Bedouins lighted their way. These bathed the walls
of chiseled stone in rippling yellow. Wooden doors appeared here and
there. Whitey Jano pulled open one of these.</p>

<p>Odor of frankincense and myrrh, of other spices, permeated the
space. A torch was thrust in. Long tiers of carven mummy cases
occupied shelves along the walls. The mummy cases were oversize. The
wood was of cedar, perhaps thousands of years old.</p>

<p>Duzun Kado's mute slave shrank back. His seeming dumbness did not
include lack of superstition, apparently. He pressed suddenly to his
master's side. Peculiar cluckings came from his quivering lips.</p>

<p>"The mummy cases are older, infinitely, and of a more intricate
design than those of the earliest Egyptians," commented Duzun Kado.
"Let us proceed. I would waste no further time. Let us view the
chamber of the treasure. Already, we have some understanding of this
ancient element."</p>

<p>"The Seven Companies Syndicate has great wisdom," suggested
Kassan. "The tests have been made."</p>

<p>"Truly," spoke Duzun Kado. "For some time it has been known that
minute quantities of the most powerful radioactive substance will
produce shadow photographs of objects on sensitized plates. This has
been determined with radium. Your element, which we may term
'tasunite,' has been assembled in comparatively vast quantities."</p>

<p>Kassan nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"The Seven Companies Syndicate then, knows the reputed powers of
the ancestors of Hadith?"</p>

<p>"In our poor way, we have experimented," declared Duzun Kado.
"This tasunite is of a purity greater than the radium of pitch-blende
or uranite. Obviously, it will instantly destroy vegetable and animal
matter. Its reflecting exposure sensitizes the earth or near-by
objects for considerable area. This acts like photographic plates. So
much for the legendary aspect of this fabulous force. But the Seven
Companies Syndicate has determined it is of a value greater than
radium, of which the world has less than six pounds in possession of
many people."</p>

<p>Kassan's shrewd black eyes studied the fat Syrian. Whitey Jano
munched his crackling popcorn. Perhaps some of this was beyond his
cruder wisdom.</p>

<p>They stood at a turn in the ancient passage. The fat Syrian
observed the set of the stone walls. His plump hand rubbed along a
crack. It came away covered with oozing dampness. Duzun Kado studied
this unobtrusively. Apparently, they were now directly above the
tunnel leading under the besieged city of Tasunan.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI. BURIED DEATH GLOW</h2>

<p>DUZUN KADO, the fat Syrian, paused before the low wooden door
indicated by Whitey Jano. This was set in one wall of a wide turning
of the passage. Whitey tossed a grain of popcorn. The light of the
torches was flickering. He missed catching it. Popping another
directly into his mouth, he crunched.</p>

<p>"We will proceed to the storage chamber of the tasunite,"
suggested Whitey. "If the representative of the Seven Companies
Syndicate is satisfied, then audience will be granted with the
All-Wise One."</p>

<p>The fat Syrian did not appear to be listening. He appeared resting
momentarily. His breath seemed to wheeze a little, as if from the
effort of propelling his corpulent frame along the passage. The
Bedouins with the torches were grouped a short distance away.</p>

<p>One ear of Duzun Kado was close to the wooden doors. None of the
others could hear anything but Whitey's benevolent tones and the low
mutter of the Bedouins conversing.</p>

<p>From nowhere in particular came a rare trilling which echoed
through the musty passageway. Its little echoes were shivers of
tuneful, yet tuneless, melody. This might have been an escapement of
age-old air from some death crypt. There was instant commotion among
the Bedouins.</p>

<p>The Arabs were a superstitious lot. This uncanny sound was
inexplicable. The death glow they now knew and understood. The
Bedouins rustled around. The flares of their torches dipped. Shadows
became uncertain.</p>

<p>For the first time, Whitey Jano's placid countenance lost its
benevolent aspect. His jaws ceased to crunch popcorn.</p>

<p>"Doc Savage! Wellah! Wellah!"</p>

<p>Both Whitey and Kassan whipped around. They had been staring at
the fat Syrian. His greasy, somewhat repulsive face was
emotionless.</p>

<p>The loose sleeve of the Syrian fluttered. With the swiftness of a
snake striking, the huge, pudgy fists flew upward. Kassan was
closest. His light body lifted and slammed clear across the passage
into the wall.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano wasn't built for quick movement. He turned as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>"You--" he got out and no more.</p>

<p>The great fist of Duzun Kado struck again. Its speed was like a
light flashing. Knuckles were buried in Whitey Jano's stomach. From
his gaping mouth spewed crunched popcorn, along with escaping breath
from his lungs. He crashed down upon Kassan.</p>

<p>"Wellah! Wellah!" rolled the cry of the Bedouins through the
ancient passage.</p>

<p>They understood little of this. Only they saw clearly that the fat
Syrian no longer was dackhile. As an inviolate guest he had assailed
his hosts. Torches flaring, the Bedouins rolled in a wave of rage
upon Duzun Kado.</p>

<p>"GET the door open, Long Tom," spoke the calm voice of the fat
Syrian.</p>

<p>"O. K., Doc," replied the black, mute slave, whipping a sharp tool
equipped with a generator box from the sleeve of his gumbaz.</p>

<p>Doc Savage shed the abba he had been wearing as a Syrian. The
cloak hampered his movements. The figure of the man of bronze was
gigantic. It seemed to fill the passage. The Bedouins hesitated only
a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Bismillah el rahman!" yelled one.</p>

<p>This invoking the name of Allah sent courage into their veins. A
rifle crashed. Its explosion confined in the passage was shattering
to eardrums. Another, then another gun blasted. The riflemen knew
they could not have missed Doc Savage.</p>

<p>But instead of pitching to the floor, he advanced upon the
Bedouins. They paused uncertainly. Long knives flashed. One whizzed
past Doc's eyes. Had his head not jerked with incredible speed, the
blade would have split his forehead.</p>

<p>Doc's hands made a little flicking movement.</p>

<p>"Don't breathe, Long Tom," he advised. "Hold it longer than usual.
There is little air."</p>

<p>The foremost Bedouins halted in their stride. Their knives made a
clinking on the stone floor. All but one huge Arab smacked to their
knees, much in the attitude of prayer. But they were not blessing the
name of Allah now. They were dropping to sleep in grotesque
postures.</p>

<p>The one Bedouin came on with black eyes glittering. He understood
English. He had not breathed. Little glasslike capsules had tinkled
on the stone floor. The passageway was flooded with the anaesthetic
gas devised by Monk at Doc's direction.</p>

<p>Doc did not move until the Bedouin leaped and struck with his
knife. The bronze man permitted the blade to jam into his breast.</p>

<p>"Aiee!" squawked the Bedouin.</p>

<p>His arm was almost cracked. It was as if he had tried to drive
steel into stone. Doc's bulletproof undergarment of metallic chain
mesh bounced the knife from his hand.</p>

<p>As he squawked, the Bedouin breathed. He collapsed with an Asiatic
curse he could not complete.</p>

<p>Doc whipped around. With the flame from the generator box, Long
Tom had pierced the lock of the death chamber door. Doc's corded
hands gripped the edge. The lock fell apart.</p>

<p>Long Tom fanned a ray from his generator flashlight. From the
floor came a series of clucking groans. It was these groans Doc had
heard through the wooden door when the party had stopped on the
outside passage. Minute sounds though they were, Doc's acute sense of
hearing had picked them out.</p>

<p>Doc handed a keen knife to Long Tom. In his own hands he had that
which the Bedouin had dropped.</p>

<p>From the wall came a scraping sound of wood on stone.</p>

<p>"Quickly, Long Tom," advised Doc.</p>

<p>Their knives sheared through camel-hide thongs. Pat Savage was the
first lifted to her feet. She tore the gag from her mouth.</p>

<p>"I knew all the time nothing could happen," she gasped out.</p>

<p>"It will happen if you don't get outside," stated Doc, cutting the
thongs off Renny. "Get out and run along the passage."</p>

<p>The scraping of wood on stone continued with a jerking noise as if
the murder mechanism so long in disuse had stuck. They had been
prisoners in a room in which the murder shadow could operate.</p>

<p>"Ow-ee!" squealed Monk. "Just let me get my hands on the black
devils that give me the scare of my life!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk," advised Doc. "Run!"</p>

<p>MONK loped toward the door. Within ten seconds, all had fled into
the passage. Doc crouched by the door of the death chamber. He
guessed the control chamber of the shadow glow was just beyond
that.</p>

<p>From one wall flickered a thread of greenish light. Between his
thumb and finger Doc held a pellet no larger than a small marble. His
thumb nail pushed a lever. He tossed the pellet into the death
chamber, well toward the opposite wall. The pellet contained a high
explosive of terrific power perfected by Doc.</p>

<p>Slamming the door, the bronze giant leaped away after his
companions. All were many yards away when the underground passages
rocked with a terrific explosion. The door of the death chamber
behind them parted from its fastenings and smacked into the opposite
wall.</p>

<p>Rocks shattered and crashed. A greenish glow sprang up, but it
seemed to be shredded into vanishing points of light. The air tingled
electrically.</p>

<p>"Keep going toward the first side tunnel," advised Doc.</p>

<p>Before the splintering walls had ceased falling, the man of bronze
was back near the door of the death chamber. He saw the Bedouins
sleeping on the floor.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano and Kassan had miraculously escaped the falling walls.
The cavern of the death chamber was filled with fallen rock. The
instruments of the murderer glow were completely buried. The control
chamber was blocked behind hundreds of tons of rocks.</p>

<p>The passage leading toward the storage chamber of the tasunite was
cut off by a jumbled mass.</p>

<p>"We have temporarily robbed Hadith and the individual they call
the All-Wise One of their greatest power," stated Doc Savage, joining
his companions as they reached the turning of a passageway.</p>

<p>"Now what do we do, Doc?" questioned Pat Savage, trying to get
some of the dirt off her face with the assistance of Long Tom's
flashlight.</p>

<p>"Dag-gone it!" piped Monk. "Something will turn up! Ever since
they planted that woman's picture in the window there's been plenty
doin' without thinkin' about it!"</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris showed little elation at having been rescued. The
massacre of the faithful old Mahal and the remnant of his expedition
apparently had sapped nearly all his interest in life.</p>

<p>"I'd thought--well, I'd hoped perhaps Denton might somehow be
alive," he said sadly. "If he was, then he was somewhere inside that
explosion."</p>

<p>The black mouth of a side tunnel loomed before them. Long Tom's
flash showed this slanted downward.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this is the passageway leading under the city of
Tasunan!" exclaimed Johnny.</p>

<p>"It would seem so," assented Doc. "And this is perhaps our only
chance of escaping Hadith's Bedouins outside."</p>

<p>Footsteps clumped in the tunnel darkness. Long Tom switched off
his light. Doc swept the others back. He opened a door. The spiced
odor of ancient grave clothes assailed their nostrils.</p>

<p>A cadaverous form came slowly into the upper passage. The man was
alone. He paused uncertainly.</p>

<p>Doc stood in the door. From his hand played a pencil beam. It
struck upon a face covered with matted beard and terribly
emaciated.</p>

<p>"Denton! Denton!" screamed Ranyon Cartheris, hoarsely.</p>

<p>THE younger brother clasped his arms around the mass of filthy
rags enwrapping the attenuated skeleton. The apparition mumbled. His
teeth had been knocked out. His fingers clawed at his brother's
shoulders.</p>

<p>Tears furrowed the dirt on Denton Cartheris's cheeks.</p>

<p>"Months I've been there--months, you hear? Sealed--sealed in a
tomb--earthquake just broke down the wall--you've
come--everything--everything's all right--the shadows--shadows!"</p>

<p>The mumbling arose to a scream. The long-imprisoned explorer
collapsed. It seemed he was freed from his tomb to die in his
brother's arms.</p>

<p>But the great surgical skill of Doc Savage saved him. The bronze
giant was perhaps the world's greatest surgeon and physician, along
with his other achievements. He quickly drew emergency tubes from his
clothing.</p>

<p>A combination stimulant, stronger than employed in most hospitals,
flowed into the explorer's veins. Swift convulsions ran through the
emaciated body. Then Denton Cartheris breathed regularly, more
easily. He was able quickly to get to his feet.</p>

<p>The crypt of the huge mummy cases consisted of many passages. Monk
pulled off the carved lid of a boatlike ancient coffin. He replaced
it quickly.</p>

<p>"Lookin' at that fella makes me feel like I'd been dead a long
time myself an' they forgot to bury me," said Monk in an awed
voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah," drawled Ham. "It was an oversight forgetting that."</p>

<p>"Blast you!" squealed Monk. "In a minute they'll be puttin' you in
a half a dozen of them coffins, 'cause you're goin' to be in that
many pieces or more!"</p>

<p>Doc Savage had become a statue beside the passage door. His
extraordinary auditory sense could hear distinctly where only
whispers came to the others.</p>

<p>Doc held up one hand as warning. All became silent, tense. Then
they heard it. Feet moved, as if a barefooted army was marching. Came
the voice of Hadith, the Nubian. Doc's companions and Denton
Cartheris could understand the Arabic perfectly.</p>

<p>"You have betrayed us, Jano!" was Hadith's accusation. "We had
expected your trickery. Where is this Duzun Kado? You've buried the
treasure to keep it from us. The chamber of control has been
destroyed!"</p>

<p>Whitey Jano was composed. Clearly came the crunching of his jaws.
His tone was gently benevolent, unexcited.</p>

<p>"Don't begin making more mistakes, Hadith," he said, calmly. "You
failed to destroy this Doc Savage; now he has--"</p>

<p>A MUFFLED voice interrupted. Identification of the speaker was
impossible for the prisoners in the mummy crypt, except for Doc
Savage. A knowing smile twitched the corners of the bronze man's
mouth. This seemed ludicrous, seeing he still was presenting the fat,
oily face of the Syrian.</p>

<p>Said this muffled voice, "You cannot get away with it, Jano. I
have known all the time you were prepared to seize the treasure. Our
compact is broken. Now I leave you to Hadith. It is 'yes,'
Hadith!"</p>

<p>Only the voices, the sounds told what was happening. For the first
time, the tone of Whitey Jano lost its benevolent coolness.</p>

<p>"No! You don't know what you're saying! I tell you we've been
tricked! Will you listen?"</p>

<p>"There is no more to be said." The muffled voice again. "The
All-Wise One now sees and understands. The All-Wise One has spoken!
It has been agreed!"</p>

<p>"No! No! The All-Wise One wouldn't--couldn't--no! Hadith! Allah,
the Merciful! No!"</p>

<p>Had the soul of Runt Davis been hovering about, its torture must
have been appeased at that strangling scream. The head of the
decapitated mobster must have laughed in unholy glee.</p>

<p>Whitey Jano spoke no more. To Doc's ears came the chilling swish
of Hadith's jeweled scimitar. Two thumps sounded. The lesser one must
have been a head striking the floor of the passage. Whitey Jano's
body dropped after his head.</p>

<p>"That is finished," pronounced the muffled voice, "as the All-Wise
One desires. You will now proceed to search out Doc Savage and those
with him. Temporarily, we have no more of the shadow glow available,
but this bronze man and the others must be disposed of quickly."</p>

<p>"It shall be as the All-Wise One desires," came Hadith's
voice.</p>

<p>THE barefooted army scuffled away. None had approached the door of
the mummy crypts. Doc had a quick foreboding of disaster in that
simple fact. Why had they not attempted to enter this door?</p>

<p>The man of bronze concealed his quick belief.</p>

<p>"Whitey Jano has been removed," Doc stated. "I believe that was
intended from the beginning, before he left New York. Hadith, the
Nubian, will follow when this All-Wise One has finished with
him."</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" growled Renny. "The double double-crossers! Jano
framin' to bump off his own mobsters! The big chief plannin' to bump
off him an' that Nubian devil!"</p>

<p>"Those who have never had it soon become drunk with power and
blood," observed the bronze man.</p>

<p>Doc was moving in a gliding circle. He counted a dozen passages
filled with the oversize mummy cases. From somewhere came the whisper
of soft-sandaled feet. These made confusing echoes. The others heard
them not at all.</p>

<p>"All of you hide yourselves," counseled Doc. "Into the empty mummy
cases, as fast as you can find them."</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" complained Monk. "Me get in one of them
coffins?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" hissed Ham. "The coffin won't know the difference!"</p>

<p>Doc's acute hearing and sense of creeping enemies told him they
were being surrounded. The others were making a ghastly clattering as
they pulled lids from the mummy cases. Doc issued a quick order. Long
Tom flicked off his flashlight. Every one fumbled in darkness.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Pat Savage.</p>

<p>Johnny, in a low voice, interpreted the reason for Pat's
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Pat. The shriveled remnant of prehistoric
civilization animating your sense of repulsion is irretrievably
inanimate."</p>

<p>Johnny was not quite himself, or he never would have employed two
such words as "animating" and "inanimate" in the same sentence.</p>

<p>From Pat Savage came no reply. She had not exclaimed, as Johnny
had supposed, at the touch of a long-dead face. A lean hand had
whipped out of the darkness where she stood. It clamped over her
mouth. A thumb found a great nerve at the base of her brain.</p>

<p>The beautiful cousin of Doc was lifted into one of the crypt's
mysterious passages. She had been temporarily paralyzed.</p>

<p>Pat was being abducted again. It seemed to have become somewhat of
a habit with Pat.</p>

<p>THE others did not immediately know it. Doc had sprung to one
side, crouching behind a mummy case. His movement was actuated by a
furtive creeping which multiplied all around the little band.</p>

<p>The space of the mummy crypt flared into light. This was
accomplished by the simultaneous touching off of a dozen oiled
torches in a ring around them.</p>

<p>Instantly came the muffled voice Doc had heard in the outside
passage.</p>

<p>"You will make no move or all will die at once! You cannot escape
this time!"</p>

<p>Doc had identified the voice. None of the others had. But Doc had
long known the owner of this voice would be at least partly in
command.</p>

<p>None had yet succeeded in hiding in empty mummy cases. Renny
bellowed a confused invective. The big engineer was trapped in the
act of lifting a dried mummy from its ancient coffin. He had intended
to try squeezing his huge body into the space.</p>

<p>Doc remained hidden for only a few seconds. The torch flares
glinted on two-score rifle barrels. The menacing muzzles stuck out
from many passages. There had been another door into the burial
crypts. Perhaps several doors.</p>

<p>"Why, I'll push them guns down their black throats!" yelled Monk.
"I'll--"</p>

<p>"Do as commanded," came the quiet voice of Doc. "The All-Wise One
is speaking the truth, for the present."</p>

<p>The hidden voice laughed croakingly.</p>

<p>"For the present! By your own destruction of access to the shadow
glow, you have become elected to the flowing river!"</p>

<p>The rifles were a threat Doc could not ignore. He might have
chanced a fight for himself, but none of the others now possessed
weapons or bulletproof garb.</p>

<p>The fingers of the bronze man touched one of his high explosive
grenades. He did not act. The high-powered blast could only bring
down the rocks upon them, perhaps seal them in the tombs.</p>

<p>The man of bronze stepped from concealment. Use of the anaesthetic
capsules was blocked by the widely scattered positions of the
Bedouins. Scores could be seen far along many passages.</p>

<p>Renny roared protest. Monk barked wild oaths, his trailing hands
twitching. But all were swiftly surrounded. The tall Hadith, scimitar
flashing, issued commands.</p>

<p>Doc and Long Tom were quickly stripped of every weapon and device.
Doc's partly bald wig, that of the Syrian makeup, was pulled from his
head. This left his smooth, bronze hair shining in the light of the
torches.</p>

<p>Leathery thongs of camelskin were whipped around the arms of all.
Hadith's black face wore a grin of triumphant hate. Thus Doc Savage
could no longer escape the will of Allah, as interpreted by the giant
Nubian.</p>

<p>THE prisoners were pushed into the outer passage. Monk and Ham
were in the rear. Rifles prodded every one. Ham spoke in the language
of the ancient Mayan race. The communication was to Doc. The
adventurers used this tongue when they did not wish to be understood
by others.</p>

<p>"Pat is not with us," was Ham's message. "Maybe she got herself
hidden in one of the mummy cases?"</p>

<p>"She did not succeed in hiding," was Doc's surprising reply. "She
was taken away."</p>

<p>The jeweled scimitar of Hadith whirled menacingly over Ham's head.
Its great blade swished past his angular nose. Though the lawyer was
amazed at Doc's words, he deemed it wise to make no answer.</p>

<p>Bedouin riflemen jostled in the passageway behind their prisoners.
The strange procession moved into a new tunnel. It slanted upward.
Doc's face got the feel of dampness in the air, as if a little wind
was blowing across water.</p>

<p>Behind the eight captives--Doc and his men, and the Cartheris
brothers--came Bedouins bearing strange burdens. These were not
heavy, but they were of clumsy pattern. Cedar is the lightest of
woods. The mummy cases were of cedar.</p>

<p>The Arabs were bringing eight oversize mummy cases. The tunnel
angled more sharply upward and came finally to steps carved in stone.
Rushing water gurgled.</p>

<p>The muffled, hidden voice spoke from behind the Bedouins.</p>

<p>"Place all in the ancient coffins!"</p>

<p>Doc and the others were seized by many hands.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII. FLEET OF DEATH</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE worked at the camel-hide thongs binding his giant arms
behind him. His disguise as the fat Syrian was an advantage. Chunks
of what seemed like flesh peeled from his wrists and hands. A strand
of the thongs loosened.</p>

<p>"Dang it!" howled the voice of Monk close by. "They stick us in
coffins before we're dead, an' they don't even take the trouble to
bury us!"</p>

<p>It was a wonderful opening for Ham. The lawyer ignored it. His own
thoughts were far from pleasant. The darkness was so opaque it seemed
smothering him.</p>

<p>"Doc," came the subdued voice of Renny, "have you got any idea
where we're headed for?"</p>

<p>The bronze man's hands were free.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," he replied. "We have come much more
than a mile swiftly. Thus far, the underground river has been
confined in an aqueduct. Presently, it may scatter in the sands."</p>

<p>"Blast 'em, I knew it!" moaned Monk. "When it scatters, where do
we go?"</p>

<p>None of the seven other men had an answer to that one. Doc himself
was flexing the arms that had been bound. Though he could outswim the
best swimmers, it was manifestly impossible for any one to make
headway for a mile of distance against the rapidly flowing
underground river.</p>

<p>And if he had attempted it, the seven other men could only have
continued on their gruesome voyage with death waiting at the end. Doc
was analyzing their situation.</p>

<p>The fleet of oversize mummy cases bobbed along on the
smooth-flowing water. Each carried a man. The cedar of the ancient
coffins was light. It would float, as long as space remained above
the water.</p>

<p>But how long would there be space? At any minute, the occupants of
the floating mummy cases expected their death boat to bump into some
overhead obstruction. All, including Doc, believed the river would
suck the fleet of ancient, carved cedar into a tunnel without
air.</p>

<p>The man of bronze had been stripped even of his bulletproof
garments. Not a single device remained on his body. Yet he did not
lose hope. If he had been alone, he would have attempted fighting his
way back. Now, he could not abandon the others to their fate. By
careful maneuvering, he reached each coffin in turn and released his
men's bonds.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a chill struck through the one-man crews of those
strange bobbing boats. The mummy cases had remained well bunched. All
at the same time touched a low roof. The arched stone had slanted
sharply downward. The mummy cases bumped again. Ham's hand went up
and touched a slimy surface worn smooth by centuries of water
flow.</p>

<p>"Monk," he called out, "I guess maybe you can't help your looks. I
don't hold anything against you for the things you've said about
me."</p>

<p>"Aw nuts!" grunted Monk. "I guess maybe you can't help wantin' to
dress up like a Park Avenue Easter parade. Guess if I had your
figure, I'd wear clothes, too."</p>

<p>With these slight concessions, the pair of verbal feudists proved
they didn't have very optimistic hopes for the future. Under their
dueling insults, they had the highest opinions of each other.</p>

<p>Doc Savage said nothing. His finger tips touched the roof of the
river. It was descending by inches. The edges of the cedar mummy
cases touched now and then. Presently, they were sliding steadily
along, being forced slowly deeper. Water seeped through cracks and
soaked the men.</p>

<p>"There's something I must tell you before it's too late," came the
weak voice of Denton Cartheris. "I have known all the time that the
All-Wise One was--"</p>

<p>HIS communication gurgled to nothing. The explorer's throat had
been choked by inflowing water. Renny gasped and his big body
thrashed as if his huge legs would split the death boat asunder.</p>

<p>The mummy case containing Doc Savage was ahead of the others.</p>

<p>The man of bronze noted a sudden slowing in the speed of the
river. His hands gripped the edges of the wooden case. Rock rasped
along his fingers. He estimated they must have floated at least two
miles through the subterranean passage. There could be no going back,
even if opportunity were given.</p>

<p>The underground stream was coming to its terminus. This might be a
spreading of the water deep down, losing itself in the rocks and
sands of the desert. Or--</p>

<p>"Howlin' calamities!" squealed Monk. "We're comin' up!"</p>

<p>Eight weighted mummy cases bobbed free of the tunnel. All were
still floating. They seemed to have entered a broad underground pond.
The mummy cases moved slowly, as if caught in a great whirlpool. Doc
Savage felt the rocks at the sides. The water gurgled.</p>

<p>It was being sucked away into a small aperture between the rocks.
The man of bronze hurriedly propelled the mummy case along. He came
to another opening. These were only inches in width. There were many
of them.</p>

<p>Doc spoke. His voice echoed eerily. The roof of the river here was
a vast domelike vault.</p>

<p>"We seem to have arrived," he stated.</p>

<p>"Holy cow!" bellowed Renny. "You mean we aren't to be drowned?
We're trapped down here?"</p>

<p>Doc had made a complete round of their prison. The underground
pond was perhaps two hundred yards in diameter.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" rapped Monk. "We'd better have been drowned!"</p>

<p>"Always complaining," said Ham. "There isn't any pleasing the ape
family."</p>

<p>The feud was on again. They had escaped death temporarily.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the rocky vault vibrated strangely. The slowly moving
pond of the death trap danced in little waves.</p>

<p>"An' now it's an earthquake," groaned Renny.</p>

<p>"No," stated Doc. "The attack on Tasunan has begun. That was an
underground explosion. It sounded almost directly beneath us."</p>

<p>A second muffled blast reverberated through the subterranean
vault.</p>

<p>"Do you think then, this is all an artificial aqueduct, Doc?"
inquired Johnny.</p>

<p>He received no reply. An empty mummy case bumped against his own.
This was the one that had been occupied by Doc.</p>

<p>DOC SAVAGE was swimming under water. In utter darkness he had
retained an uncanny sense of the direction by which their fleet had
entered the wide pond. The hands of the bronze man were groping along
the seamed stones of the bottom.</p>

<p>In about two minutes he emerged. Swimming rapidly to the others,
Doc Savage spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Out of the mummy cases and swim," he directed. "Push the cases
with you and follow my voice. See that Denton Cartheris is brought
along. He is unable to help himself."</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" said Renny.</p>

<p>The man of bronze said nothing. He was fumbling with his bronze
hair, which seemed waterproof.</p>

<p>Another deep explosion jarred the domed rocks. The blast might
have been some distance away, but the sound indicated it was far
under the ground.</p>

<p>The eight mummy cases were bunched in one spot. Again Doc had
dived deeply. His hands slid along the bottom. Traveling with the
slow whirlpool of the pond, the man of bronze reached the side where
the inflow was strong.</p>

<p>Absorbing lungfuls of air, he went down again. Now he did a
strange thing. One ear was laid on the bottom stones. Doc remained in
that position for several seconds.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface, the bronze man called out.</p>

<p>"Is every one with the mummy cases?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all here," came the voice of Ham. "And we're all
standing up. It's only a few feet deep over here."</p>

<p>"That is good," advised Doc. "Don't any one put his head under
water. Stand where you are."</p>

<p>Doc was treading water. His hands went to his head. It seemed he
had removed his bronze scalp. This was the bulletproof skullcap he
often wore.</p>

<p>From four cavities inside the cap, Doc removed flat, metallic
objects. Each of these was equipped with a small lever. Doc replaced
the metal cap. Again he dived deeply.</p>

<p>Swimming against the current, the man of bronze passed into the
inflowing stream. He progressed several yards. He carefully set a
small lever on one of the flat metallic objects. The current carried
him back into the pond.</p>

<p>From about the middle of the pond, Doc swiftly moved levers on the
remaining three flat objects. He hurled them together in the
direction of the river's entry. Then he dived, swimming rapidly
away.</p>

<p>BEDLAM broke loose. Combined blasts threatened to shatter
eardrums. Doc and the others were swept by a huge wave. They were
dashed into the rocky wall. The roof of the underground vault seemed
to collapse on the farther side.</p>

<p>The next succeeding wave was smaller.</p>

<p>Suddenly the water was sucking away. The depths decreased. A
booming hollow sound came from the subterranean tunnel. In a few
minutes, the pond was draining.</p>

<p>Doc led the way over slippery rocks. He came to a gaping aperture
in the floor. Some distance away, water boomed downward. The bottom
of the ancient aqueduct had been blown out. On the side where Doc and
his companions stood, the floor was dry.</p>

<p>The subterranean river of Tasunan was pouring like a Niagara
through the blasted bottom. Tons of water smashed down into a lower
tunnel.</p>

<p>From a distance suddenly came cries of men. Faint voices were
calling upon Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate. One voice
screamed high. This was not in Arabic. The lower tunnel was filling
with a rushing flood.</p>

<p>The underground stream was smashing through the passage leading
beneath the city of Tasunan. The distant screaming voices died
out.</p>

<p>All of the deeper tunnel was flooded to its roof.</p>

<p>The water started surging back. In it floated the bodies of some
Bedouins.</p>

<p>"Come!" directed Doc. "Over this way."</p>

<p>His amazed companions followed. Denton Cartheris came slowly,
supported by his brother. The explosions of Doc's powerful grenades
had opened a gap in the side wall of the huge vault of the pond.</p>

<p>They emerged into the passage at the end of which the death
chamber had been wrecked. Along here, Doc had previously determined
the position of the subterranean aqueduct. He had felt the moisture
oozing through the ancient stone.</p>

<p>His sense of direction and the soundings had enabled him to
discover that the tunnel to Tasunan had been constructed under the
river. Perhaps the Tasunans themselves had first had the idea of thus
flooding their defenses.</p>

<p>As Doc led his men to the yawning entrance, a few Bedouins left
outside were fleeing toward the pass in the hills. The black tents
stood out starkly.</p>

<p>The man of bronze led the way toward one of the smaller black
tents.</p>

<p>"Stay back!" he commanded the others.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII. THE ALL-WISE ONE</h2>

<p>DOC SAVAGE gazed only a few seconds at the body in the black tent.
He went in and covered the figure with a beautifully colored shawl.
The head had been almost severed from the body.</p>

<p>"Blast it!" Monk was squawking. "I'm goin' back! Pat's somewhere
in them tombs! Maybe they didn't take her along!"</p>

<p>"Me, too!" agreed Renny. "We've got to find her!"</p>

<p>The fleeing Bedouins were disappearing into the pass.</p>

<p>"It will not be difficult to find Pat," smiled Doc Savage. "She
always manages to come through. This time seems no exception."</p>

<p>The man of bronze was facing toward the jumbled rocks above the
entrance to the tomb. Two figures came from among the rocks. One was
slender with a white face.</p>

<p>The other figure had a dark-skinned countenance. The man wore the
usual kafieh, gumbaz and abba of the Arabian. His white teeth were
showing in a smile. Across his breast was a varicolored ribbon, as of
some honorary degree.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Kassan!" exclaimed the thin voice of Denton Cartheris.
"My good friend Kassan, of the Tasunans!"</p>

<p>Monk had sprung forward. He hadn't heard the explorer's words.</p>

<p>"At last I've gotcha!" yelled Monk. "I'm goin' to rend you into
small pieces an' throw the pieces out for the crows to pick up!"</p>

<p>"Why, Monk!" exclaimed Pat Savage. "I'm surprised at you! Mr.
Kassan's been about the only fun I've had. He's kidnaped me three
times. Not many girls have been so honored."</p>

<p>Pat's dress in which she had been staked to the desert, was sadly
bedraggled. Her face was very, very dirty.</p>

<p>"Look, Doc," she said, jauntily, "what I've brought back with me.
Meet Mr. Kassan who, I understand, is Tasunan's one and only G-Man,
if that's what you'd call it."</p>

<p>"Of that, I have been informed for some time," smiled Doc. "I have
to apologize for our little difficulty in the tombs, Mr. Kassan. But
it was necessary to impress Whitey Jano and the Bedouins. They would
have considered it queer if I had not struck you."</p>

<p>"The pleasure was all mine, I assure you," said Mr. Kassan in
perfect English. "But you certainly pack a tremendous what you would
call a 'wallop.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Kassan grabbed me the last time to keep me from falling
into the hands of Hadith," said Pat Savage. "The first time, in
Manhattan, he was kind of rough. I'm glad you hit him once anyway,
Doc."</p>

<p>Mr. Kassan bowed low.</p>

<p>"The lovely cousin of Doc Savage always seems to be around when
I'm in a what you call a 'kidnaping mood,'" he smiled. His face
hardened then. "And Hadith and the white man perished in the
underground passage," he added. "We were close by, but came out of
another entrance I know."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be superamalgamated!" exclaimed Johnny. "And I had
proved by indisputable logic you could be no other than the All-Wise
One himself! Before that, I was getting suspicious of this Carson
Dernall, but he was wiped out with Doc's dirigible."</p>

<p>"CARSON DERNALL was not destroyed with the dirigible," drawled
Long Tom. "He escaped from the blazing craft by parachute, the same
as I did. Doc found me, after he escaped from the Bedouins. That was
when he conceived the plan of our making up as Syrian master and
slave.</p>

<p>"Dernall landed near where I did, but Doc allowed him to get away,
purposely. Dernall lived to carry out his original intention of
double-crossing Whitey Jano. And he intended to put Hadith on the
spot, too. His object was the undisputed control of the tasunite
element and the city of Tasunan.</p>

<p>"It was tasunite that destroyed the dirigible. Dernall had
secreted some of it in the ship. And so great was its power, that,
like radium, only stronger, when released it caused the airship to
burn and disintegrate, even though normally fireproof.</p>

<p>"Dernall intended to set himself up as emperor of the hidden
city."</p>

<p>"True in part," stated Doc. "Only Carson Dernall was not the real
All-Wise One."</p>

<p>"That agrees with my own observation," said Mr. Kassan. "But he
died with the others in the flooded tunnel. We Tasunans owe you a
great debt. You shall have as much of the element you have called
tasunite as you desire. It will be worth many millions to you."</p>

<p>Doc smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is a powerful and dangerous composition, Mr. Kassan. Only a
very little of it would be safe to have abroad. I would advise that
only small quantities be mined from the buried tunnel. I will accept
none for myself, but I would appreciate having your people send some
to various hospitals I will name. I would say Ranyon and Denton
Cartheris are entitled to great reward."</p>

<p>Mr. Kassan was in an expansive, bowing mood.</p>

<p>"They shall have all they desire," he agreed. "But haven't we
forgotten something vital. How about the All-Wise One?'</p>

<p>"You will come with me, Mr. Kassan," said Doc.</p>

<p>Within the black tent, Doc lifted the colored shawl.</p>

<p>"May Allah have mercy and compassion on her soul," murmured Mr.
Kassan.</p>

<p>OUTSIDE, Pat Savage said suddenly, "What has happened to Lady
Fotheran?"</p>

<p>Ranyon Cartheris was grave-faced. Denton Cartheris's emaciated
countenance indicated he must fear the worst.</p>

<p>"Oh," murmured Pat Savage. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Doc Savage came from the black tent with Mr. Kassan. He paused
beside the Cartheris brothers.</p>

<p>"If you will accompany me, perhaps we can confirm an idea," said
the man of bronze. "Pat, you will remain here until we return."</p>

<p>Pat Savage was all woman. As the little group moved away, she
slipped to the door of the black tent. Her glimpse showed her a pair
of small feet protruding from under the bright shawl.</p>

<p>Pat gasped and shoved the back of her hand over her mouth.</p>

<p>"So that was it," she said, tears starting to her eyes. "That's
why Doc was so mysterious."</p>

<p>Doc Savage removed a flat, square metal box from one of the camel
packs that had been part of his Duzun Kado equipment. The box was the
one that had dropped from the ruins of the dirigible and which Doc
had hidden in the sand. He had uncovered it and brought it with him
when he and Long Tom had entered the camp as coming from Alleppo.</p>

<p>Now, from the box, Doc took several sections of thick glass. They
had been cut into parts something resembling a cross-word puzzle.</p>

<p>Doc fitted these sections together. The slender, lovely figure of
a woman with an upraised hand appeared. The silhouette of the face
was distinctive. The nose was straight, the chin uptilted. The throat
was a deep, unusually curving line. Doc explained the circumstances
of the window of the music store.</p>

<p>The two Cartheris brothers gazed at it only a moment. Ranyon
placed his arm around the older man's shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's Sathyra, no doubt of it," he said, slowly. "She was seeking
your help, Doc Savage, and went to her death. But who--who is this
other woman lying dead in the tent?"</p>

<p>"She was known as Marian Le Gorde, your sister's secretary and the
wife of Carson Dernall," stated Doc Savage. "Your sister was not
aware of her real identity. Dernall was really under his wife's rule.
But a woman has no face among the Bedouins, so she permitted him to
assume her place as the All-Wise One."</p>

<p>"My sister," murmured Denton Cartheris, dropping to a thin knee.
His hand touched the plate glass reverently. "She died trying to get
help for us."</p>

<p>"The glass shall be buried with all the honors of Tasunan," said
Mr. Kassan. "The All-Wise One lies dead in the black tent. The
Bedouins possibly held her responsible for the disaster
underground."</p>

<p>A little later, Mr. Kassan said to Doc Savage and his group: "You
shall be the guests of Tasunan while you are here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps I shall be kidnaped again!" said Pat Savage,
hopefully.</p>
